Dungeon Preview - Updated Mogu'shan Palace (Build 15589)<br />
Mogu'shan Palace is one of the new dungeons introduced in Mists of Pandaria, you might remember it from our first wave of dungeon previews (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgCcxUUpe0). As you can see, Blizzard made a lot of progress and the dungeon is starting to look really good. <br />
<br />
This is still a work in progress and it will look even better when it hits the beta servers!<br />

Stormstout Brewery Introduction Quest<br />
In this quest chain you first meet Chen Stormstout soon after entering Valley of the Four Winds for the first time. You help him through several of the quest hubs, brewing beer many times. <br />
<br />
Eventually he will take that beer to the doors of Stormstout Brewery, his ancestral home, only to find that it has been overrun. You then play as Chen Stormstout, killing your way through part of the brewery and attempting to talk to Uncle Gao, who doesn't seem to be all there.<br />

Feral Incarnation Models<br />
There will be art for the cat, bear and moonkin form of Incarnation, but they will likely be adjustments (such as armor perhaps) to the existing forms, not brand new models. Hopefully we'll have something we can show you in a couple of weeks.

Reverting Black Arrow back to its 4.3 Design<br />
That does bring up a good question. Mainly regarding Serpent Spread. It appears that Black Arrow with the cast time, direct damage, and AoE components all added replaced Serpent Spread (was removed entirely.) <br />
<br />
With the revert in Black Arrow's design, will we see Serpent Spread return or will Black Arrow retain its AoE damage and direct damage but be instant cast?<br />
We would re-implement Serpent Spread. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/220686-hunterblack-arrow-feedback-concerns/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/4253904994?page=6#107))<br />

Monk Changes in Beta<br />
<br />
We're thinking that Jab (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/100780) and Expel Harm (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/115072) saw a bit too much increase to mana last patch, and we’re going to reduce them somewhat.<br />
We’ve increased the mana gain from Cherry Mana Tea (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/115294). This spell will change whenever we tune mana and healing numbers, which has been happening a lot lately.<br />
We've changed the number of serpent statues you can have out at once from 2 to 1. However, while in Stance of the Wise Serpent (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/115070), you now have Eminence (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/117895) on yourself, causing half of your damage to be healing to nearby targets. This will allow “melee healing” monks to heal through dealing damage without having their statue down. The statue is intended to be more of a “cooldown” you use on tough fights, not similar to a totem you plop down.<br />
We’re going to try having Renewing Mists (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/115151) also generate Chi (along with Surging Mist (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/116694) and Soothing Mists (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/115175)) when you cast it. The bug with Renewing Mists not showing up on raid/party frames should also be fixed in an upcoming build.<br />
We’re getting rid of Jasmine Force Tea (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/115205) because we felt it was confusing to convert Mana to Chi, then Chi back to Mana with Cherry Mana Tea (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/115294).<br />
We’re going to make Surging Mist (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/116694) require a target rather than being a cast-time smart heal. The reason why it was originally a smart heal without requiring a target was to let you build up a stack of Vital Mists (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/118674) by using Jab, then cast an instant Surging Mist without having to change your target. We think the right place for the original Surging Mist smart heal is via a glyph.<br />
One issue we’re concerned with is Surging Mist (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/116694) and Renewing Mists (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/115151) generating Chi, making it harder for you to burn down your Chi. We’re likely going to add another high Chi ability, and/or adjust talents so you can have some choice.<br />
We like how Chi Wave (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/115098) bounces from friends and enemies, because the whole theme of the monk healer is weaving damage and healing together. If Chi Wave was a pure heal, it would break away from that theme.<br />
With regard to feedback on these subjects, what we're really looking for is playing as a DPS healer (as opposed to the traditional &quot;pure healing&quot; playstyle), or perhaps a mix of the two. We want both the traditional and dps-to-heal to be viable and fun. <br />

The original test was: &quot;You are some kind of gorgeous aren't you?&quot;<br />

changed to: &quot;You seem poised and ready&quot;<br />

How is this sexist on blizzard's part? The character, yes, but not the artist who created it. It is the same as getting mad at someone who makes a movie about WWII and then people start getting offended because Nazi's are in the movie. Depending on your individual beliefs you may like or dislike the characters in both scenarios, but that is their purpose. Ji added realism into the game, because in the real world, there are some people who may be a little more flirtatious than others and behavior changes depending on who the are talking to. Seriously I really hate people sometimes. People who complained about this are either over sensitive or love to start drama.....</div></div><hr />

^Exactly this, the funny thing is the Op of the original complaint refused to even acknowledge this until like 13 days after her original post and what she said was,<br />
&quot; Where to start on the idea of why Ji is different in so many ways from the goblin NPC.<br />
Well, first of all - it's a lot easier for me to notice and feel uncomfortable by what a guy is saying than a woman, though I have been around women that have made me feel uncomfortable, societally it's just not the same. Women do not pose the same societal threat to me mentally or physically that men do most times. &quot;<br />
<br />
Basically she is scared of men and if afraid Ji was going to rape or stalk her.(or she just wanted to get famous and get more links to her blog)</div></div><hr />

I just think there are too many feminist out there, measuring every word and every look... If we really aim for equality we have to change our minds from machism-feminism to human beings.<br />
And by the way, men and women, we're actually different, we should asume that too. None better, none worst, just different.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">greyghost</div><div class="date">2012-04-15, 06:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The argument makes my brain hurt. How is this sexist on blizzard's part? The character, yes, but not the artist who created it. It is the same as getting mad at someone who makes a movie about WWII and then people start getting offended because Nazi's are in the movie. Depending on your individual beliefs you may like or dislike the characters in both scenarios, but that is their purpose. Ji added realism into the game, because in the real world, there are some people who may be a little more flirtatious than others and behavior changes depending on who the are talking to. Seriously I really hate people sometimes. People who complained about this are either over sensitive or love to start drama.....<br />
<br />
GODWIN NOOOOO.<br />
<br />
But yes, your point is dead on.<br />
<br />
For another example: there were 'some' 'feminist' 'groups' that demanded a boycott of the Game of Thrones series, accusing George R. R. Martin (the author of the magnificent series) of being pro-rape / pro-exploitation / a misogynist because the world he illustrated in his novels were full of brutality not out of place in a mideval-aged era.... which included women being treated as chattel more often than not, not being able to have says in their future, really old-fashioned views on virtue and whatnot....<br />
<br />
Which is just bizarre accusations to anyone who's actually read the series/watched the show, as it's chocked full of stunningly strong and of-era role-defying women.<br />
<br />
I mean yes, there is prostitutes in the book, with one of the main characters owning several prostitute dens in the capital city. There's another guy that flays a bunch of women alive, while feeding another women to his hunting dogs. Yes, there are monsters in his books, but just because they're there in the setting doesn't mean that he 100% supports letting dogs swarm over and eat women for entertainment. He isn't endorsing becoming a pimp, either. They are actors in a stage he has set up to tell us a story that happens to take place in an absolute crapsack world where horrible crimes exist and strong characters must struggle to survive against the rampant injustices they come against.<br />
<br />
It's really disheartening to see people submit to this kind of cognitive dissonance (which is exactly what this is, don't even f***ing argue it) when they encounter story elements that make them uncomfortable for its lack of political correctness portrayed; it's frightening, too, as in the long run it can promote an atmosphere of self-censorship for preventing character assassination at the expense of interesting, dynamic characters that could play a bigger role in telling a great story.<br />
<br />
edit: I'd also like to say this for the record.<br />
<br />
Women who immediately assume that any man who pays attention to them in a kind fashion -- even in the given example of a character that's CLEARLY intended to be a well-meaning guy with a flirtatious personality -- has no other motive but to intimidate, belittle or even assault them are being sexist.<br />
<br />
Men are not rape robots on the prowl. It can be even safely assumed that most men do not make it their goal to touch a boob each day. Some men aren't even remotely interested in having sex with their female acquaintances! In fact, even assumptions about teenaged boys craving sexual conquest a la American Pie have been scientifically found to be grossly incorrect (http://thesocietypages.org/socimages/2012/04/11/boys-delay-virginity-loss-for-fear-and-love/).<br />
<br />
Sexism cuts both ways, a lot of people refuse to acknowledge the slice towards men when it happens. It's infuriating and it completely subverts any sort of work towards gender equality, or even become further justification for perpetuated sexism.<br />
<br />
So yeah.<br />
<br />
Three cheers for a controversy chock full of stupid.</div></div><hr />

There also used to be a debuff called &quot;A Chink In the Armor&quot; in the Beta but they changed it to &quot;Unarmored&quot; (look at the full URL linked)<br />

edit: oh and about the panda thing...was he supposed to be bi that way he is attracted to both sexes that way the response would be equal? If he's not bi then why is he not allowed to talk about how attractive a woman is? If you're straight, do you have sex with someone of the same sex as you? If you don't then, OMG GENDER INEQUALITY YOU MUST DIIIIIIIIIE. A straight man is not often going to tell a stranger of the same sex face-to-face that he/she is handsome (and it wouldn't be because of their own comfort of sexuality but the possibility of the other straight person of the same sex being very sensitive). A straight man (if they have the right confidence level...and this panda would have plenty of confidence in his position) is going to tell someone of the opposite sex if he finds them attractive.

If they do, it will be the first time they've ever double-backed on the same thing solely because of user feedback. I'd love to see it happen, but I'm sure Blizzard would rather a bland world since you can't get sued over that. Someone there was probably hoping there was a tolerance for someone's sexual interest light peeking through the dirt walls and as soon as they tried to look outside of it, their eyes got poked through the hole and the hole was promptly covered up.</div></div><hr />

Yeah. I think it would be great if they changed it back to the original, but I doubt that would happen. It could then be see as &quot;Oh look Blizzard changed the text because they thought it was sexist, but then they changed it back to the original sexist text!&quot;. It shouldn't have been changed in the first place, and although it doesn't make sense to turn Ji into another generic NPC with no personality, I don't see them changing it back to the original text unfortunately.</div></div><hr />

Remember that time people weren't offended about every little thing?

These days if something is &quot;offensive&quot; to even one individual (which is purely subjective and in no way quantifiable to begin with) it's a mad dash to remove the offending item even if everyone else was okay with it instead of telling Super PC crowd to look the other way if they don't like it.<br />

<br />
you do realize, that people can be against the change but still think it was sexist? it being sexist was THE POINT. THey aren't condining the sexist behavior, they are condoning a fictional character that isn't likable existing. <br />
You do realize that fictional characters are not all good guys or bad guys. story development wise, there should be a gray area. why do you have to like every npc? What's wrong with an npc that's a dick? thats story telling. don't tell me you haven't watched a movie or ever read a book? Cause guess what, you will find dicks in them too, even the good guys. It's a FICTIONAL character in a fictional game. They designed it to be sexist on purpose to be realistic, not to be sexist. If someone writes a book about a serial killer, does that mean the author condones serial killing? you people act like blizzard is condoning sexism. All they were doing was story telling. I'm disapointed they gave to QQ on this one because it's utterly stupid. What's next, are you going to rally to have big home boxes pulled from theatres until they edit parts of script because some fictional character in a club makes a sexist remark? Or maybe you'll call that actor sexist and that movie writer sexist because that character was writen to be realistic.<br />
<br />
In a fictional word, characters should not be black and white, there is supposed to be a gray area, otherwise it's just bad story telling. I don't want EVERY npc in the game to be a super do gooder, wtf kind of world is that? I don't want to like everyone. I want characters i think are assholes, or biggots, or sexist, or whatever, they tell a story and make the world more imaginative and realistic.</div></div><hr />

I couldn't agree more... that was totally blown out of proportion by WoW Insider. I'm kind of a little disgusted with them about it. It changes the way I feel about the editors there, I like some of the writers but that was just a huge troll.<br />

this is so silly. Think about it, Ji wants to convince the pandarens to join the horde so he says stuff he thinks they want to hear. Most girls want people to think that they are beautiful and most guys want people to think that they are strong. Sure its not equal but girls and guys are different. I understand why people wants equal pay for both genders but this...People need to be less butthurt!<br />
<br />
It's ok when my female friends tell other female friends they look beautiful when we go to dinner... this was blown out of proportion by a church goer at WoW Insider... and Blizzard stupidly listened.</div></div><hr />

I decided to read the particular article in question by WoWinsider and in the first paragraph I noticed something.<br />
<br />
<br />
In most games I play, from World of Warcraft to Star Wars: The Old Republic, I make an effort to play mainly female characters. Unlike other males who play female characters, this isn't for cosmetic reasons; I'm not one of those dudes who can't bear to stare at his male character's butt for multiple hours a day. (How this is ever an argument that makes sense to people, I don't know.) This was a conscious decision on my part a few years ago, when I started to become aware of the discrimination faced by female characters.<br />
<br />
The guy is a dude. I read further into the article and I really think this guy either doesn't socialize with women or hangs around with a very small group of overly sensitive women to build up this type of opinion. <br />
First, the dialogue in question isn't &quot;that&quot; sexist and sounds more or less sarcastic or silly blunt like with the male variant.<br />
<br />
My favorite quote from the article is this one.<br />
<br />
For a female pandaren monk or warrior, &quot;gorgeous&quot; is most likely not the compliment they're looking for, and players aren't playing those characters to be complimented on their looks.<br />
Let me remind you this guy is a dude. With his mindset he just kind of took a jab at chunky girls probably without realizing it just like how Blizzard made a blunder with the dialogue that started this debate. How does he know girls who maybe overweight don't enjoy being called gorgeous? That is quite a big assumption he made there.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Deleo</div><div class="date">2012-04-16, 05:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">DB was awesome.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kirse</div><div class="date">2012-04-16, 06:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am a female and I thoroughly enjoyed the DB. So much fuss over nothing. Even if some girls don't like to be called &quot;gorgeous&quot; or to be thought of as creatures who may be motivated by that type of complement, surely you want your roleplaying games to involve...characters with flavour and personality? Are you so up tight that you are not able to appreciate controvertial characters in a make belief game, ones that drink too much, swear too much, flirt too much, kill too much? Games only take on as much life as they are given. Take away the flawed personalities, unusual mannerisms or speech patterns, and you end up taking away what makes stories compelling in the first place.<br />
<br />
Remember: Intent matters a great deal in these kinds of matters, and clearly Blizz had no intent to offend anyone. So pick and chose your battles, and fight them hard when it will make a meaningful difference. Fighting battles strictly on principle isn't always the best way to gain credibility for your cause. Take PETA and their request to &quot;the Pet Shop Boys&quot; to change their band name because it's offensive to animals. I love their cause, but even I think they take it too far. I also love equality between the sexes, but ...seriously get a helmet</div></div><hr />

It isn't complete yet. And as for shape, boring or not, it is what one would come to expect of a Chinese Palace. We have a large selection of raids and dungeons with twists and turns and peculiar environments. These screen shots are absolutely stunning.</div></div><hr />

For those that missed it, he used to say &quot;Wow, your some kind of gorgeous, aren't you?!&quot; or something very similar (you needed to be in on wave 1 or maybe 2).<br />
<br />
Queue butthurt &quot;oh it's sexist&quot; people followed by butthurt &quot;omg, artistic expression was diluted to shut up the offended people&quot; people. All accurately gathered in 3 slides. It's beautiful.<br />

Tis a shame as it set the tone for the character as a bit of a rogue/charmer kinda idea along with being a hard man (he likes to break things).</div></div><hr />

Everyone still gaga about all things WoW were totally excited about these Panderen. Blizzard said part of their lore was they were chill dudes that liked to drink beer... lots of beer. When they aren't busy drinking beer they are busy balancing themselves on poles trying to maintain their balance. All this lore was totally developed for a very long time (as I understood it from the s**tstorm that developed after their announcement at Blizzcon).<br />
<br />
Someone call the cops, he's probably drunk and making passes at the females. How awful. Poor Ji, he will now be known as sexual harassment panda.</div></div><hr />

Hahahaha. Also, considering the context of the original, I'd say &quot;You seem poised and ready&quot; comes across as even worse. :D<br />
<br />
Seriouspost: As a female myself, one who has been subject to both regular 'catcalling' and genuine sexist comments, I can't fathom why this particular quote would be offensive. A little gross maybe but seriously, anyone who wants to actually have their gender insulted needs to go play a little AoC. The NPCs utilize all of that fancy voice acting work to tell your female adventurer to get back in the kitchen every 5 minutes. <br />
<br />
In the context of WoW though...while not offensive per se, every quote that hints at furry love being taken out of this game is fine by me.</div></div><hr />

Thanks. Your feedback has been received. I don't think we need another 100+ pages of discussion about one line of quest text or this will end up being a very long beta.<br />
<br />
Whether or not you've contributed to this topic, it's time to move on.<br />
<br />
So now it is just a waiting game to see what the end result of the feedback given produced. But given about 88.8% of the people who posted on the first thread (I counted each unique name and put it into a calculator) were in favor of either reverting the change, or going with a compromise, I don't think Blizzard will ignore those numbers.
