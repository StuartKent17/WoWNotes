We are working hard to introduce an exciting new feature to World of Warcraft in patch 4.3: the Raid Finder system. While it presents unprecedented technical hurdles and may change before it’s released, we wanted to provide you with an early look at what we hope to accomplish, and share some details that we’ve worked out, which will lend some insight as to how the new feature is planned to work.<br />
<br />
So what is the Raid Finder? It will be a brand new grouping feature that superficially works much like the Dungeon Finder. Instead of five-player dungeons, the Raid Finder is designed to help players quickly and easily form a pick-up raid for a specially tuned version of the current tier of raid content: the Dragon Soul raid. It’s not intended to replace organized raiding though. You’ll still need friends and guild members to help you conquer the toughest raiding challenges that patch 4.3 has to offer.<br />
<br />
As we currently plan to roll out the Raid Finder feature in patch 4.3, level-85 players will be able to use it to access a 25-player version of the Dragon Soul raid dungeon, which will culminate in a glorious battle against Deathwing himself. Dragon Soul will be split into three different difficulties. The Raid Finder provides access to a new tier of difficulty, which in this case has split the raid into two wings, each containing four boss encounters. Meanwhile, raiders will still need to join with friends and guildmates to face the more challenging normal and heroic versions of the raid, since the Raid Finder cannot be used to access those higher difficulty levels. Naturally, because they’re harder to defeat, the normal and heroic version of Dragon Soul will drop more powerful lootalong with prestigious rewards such as achievements, titles, and epic mounts. Rich rewards still await those who face the Raid Finder version, which we hope will introduce the thrills and epic experience of raiding to a broader audience than ever before.<br />
<br />
You can access the Raid Finder through the ‘Raid’ button in the menu at the bottom of the default user interface. The Raid Finder should feel familiar to Dungeon Finder users. Just fire it up, select your class role, click the ‘Find Raid’ button, and get ready to face Deathwing’s jaw of doom.<br />
<br />
FAQ<br />
<br />
Q. Raids aren’t dungeons. Who will keep things organized?<br />
<br />
A. A Raid Finder raid will require someone to queue as leader. The Raid Finder leader will have a very limited set of powers and cannot change loot type, nor do they have the ability to arbitrarily kick people from the raid. They do have the ability to mark targets and use /raid warning, and can promote other players to be leads as well. To be most successful, each Raid Finder group should have at least one leader who will explain the fights, assign raid markers, and make the tough calls, like who the main tank and off-tanks are.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q. How will loot be distributed?<br />
<br />
A. Automatic rolls and the Need Before Greed loot rules will apply in Raid Finder raids, just as they do in Dungeon Finder instances. Also, while Dungeon Finder raids aren’t locked, you are only eligible for loot from a boss once per week. This means that if you were present for the defeat of a boss, whether you receive loot or not, then you will automatically pass on loot that drops during later attempts on that boss during the same week.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q. How will Raid Finder loot differ?<br />
<br />
A. Loot acquired through the Raid Finder, including tier set pieces, will be of a lower item level than items acquired from normal or heroic mode versions of the Dragon Soul raid, and its appearance may differ. Also, there are certain items, as well as components for legendary weapons, which will not drop in Raid Finder raids. While individual bosses will not yield Valor Points as they would in other versions of the raid, you can still earn 250 Valor Points for beating the final boss in each wing of the instance.<br />
<br />
Tier armor that drops in Raid Finder raids still provides set bonuses, and those bonuses are compatible with the higher item level versions of the armor available in the normal and heroic mode versions of the raid. None of these tier sets will be available for purchase from a vendor via Valor Points.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q. Will there be an item level requirement to use the Raid Finder?<br />
<br />
A. Yes, accessing raids via the Raid Finder will require that participating characters be level 85 and have attained a certain item level, to help ensure that they are prepared for the content they’ll be facing.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q. Will the Raid Finder be cross-realm?<br />
<br />
A. Yes, the Raid Finder will draw players from all realms. As with the Dungeon Finder, it will place some priority on grouping players from the same realm, though not at the cost of increased queue times.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q. What kind of raid composition will the Raid Finder create?<br />
<br />
A. Each Raid Finder raid will include two tanks, six healers, and seventeen damage dealers. As the raid is assembled, the Raid Finder will attempt to balance the group according to armor type, which should help ensure a healthy mix of melee and ranged dps.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q. Why 25-player only?<br />
<br />
A. A 25-player group is actually easier and faster to fill than a smaller group would be, and allows for greater flexibility in raid creation, all of which will help contribute to lower queue times. Also, 25-player raids are less subject to issues with composition or player connectivity.<br />
<br />
The Raid Finder version of the Dragon Soul raid will be designed with pick-up raiding in mind. Normal and heroic difficulties will require the greater organization and teamwork found in guild raid groups.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q. Will I get Call to Arms benefits when using the Raid Finder?<br />
<br />
A. We don’t currently plan to apply Call to Arms benefits to the Raid Finder, though that may change in the future.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q. Will I be locked to a raid I join through the Raid Finder?<br />
<br />
A. Since the Raid Finder only offers access exclusively to a specially tuned version of the Dragon Soul raid instance, instance locks will not be enforced for that version. Instance locks will still be enforced for the normal and heroic versions of the raid.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q. Can I queue with my friends in a party or raid?<br />
<br />
A. Yes, you can queue for the Raid Finder individually, in a party, or in a raid. The Raid Finder can be a great tool to help fill those last few slots in a raid.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q. I’m a dedicated raider with an organized group, what good is the Raid Finder to me?<br />
<br />
A. Since instance locks aren’t in play, Raid Finder raids could provide a way for dedicated raiders to gear up alternate characters, fill gaps in their itemization, finish off elusive set bonuses, or just have some fun while preparing to face the normal or heroic version of the raid on the next reset.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q. Why aren’t other raids available?<br />
<br />
A. The Raid Finder is intended to help players experience the current tier of content.Also, many older raids don’t require a full complement of raiders, making the Raid Finder unnecessary. This is also the first rollout of the feature and we decided to start things simple, rather than potentially delay the feature’s introduction.<br />
<br />
If the Raid Finder proves popular, more raid instances may be added to it in the future.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q. Will Vote Kick still work in the Raid Finder?<br />
<br />
A. Yes, though many of the same requirements and restrictions will be in place. For example, kicking too many times can result in a Vote Kick cooldown. Also, the thresholds are different, and several players will need to agree on kicking a candidate before the vote begins. Successful kick votes will require a significant number of Yes votes to pass.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q. What happens if I leave a Raid Finder raid before it’s over?<br />
<br />
A. Players who leave the Raid prematurely will receive a Deserter Debuff, though it will likely be of longer duration than the one applied to users of the Dungeon Finder. This debuff will only apply to the Raid Finder system.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Omedon</div><div class="date">2011-09-30, 01:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Copy-pasted from another discussion I'm having on this topic: <br />
<br />
‎&quot;A Raid Finder raid will require someone to queue as leader ... To be most successful, each Raid Finder group should have at least one leader who will explain the fights, assign raid markers, and make the tough calls, like who the main tank and off-tanks are.&quot; So, the encounters will be hard enough that someone will have to tell people how to run the fights. I read this as an admission that the dungeon journal notes will not provide enough information, and wipes will be imminent. I recommend everyone planning to use this feature READ UP ON THE FIGHTS. Don't expect the &quot;I queued on my mage as a leader so I'd get a tank-level queue&quot; player to tell you squat. Don't get me wrong, this implementation makes the most sense to me as well... but we all know that &quot;don't be new on my time&quot; expectations will still potentially come from this limited-power &quot;leader&quot; figure. <br />
<br />
‎&quot;Automatic rolls and the Need Before Greed loot rules will apply in Raid Finder raids, just as they do in Dungeon Finder instances&quot; Let that sink in. Roll need if you need it, for either spec, do not hesitate, because you will not get cross-server consensus on an otherwise status quo. <br />
<br />
&quot;Players who leave the Raid prematurely will receive a Deserter Debuff, though it will likely be of longer duration than the one applied to users of the Dungeon Finder. This debuff will only apply to the Raid Finder system.&quot; Let that sink in too. This is likely being prohibitively implemented to discourage people from leaving after the first wipe, which means pressure to avoid a second one will likely mount quickly. Don't let this feature be a funsucker, use it only when you're in the right frame of mind.</div></div><hr />

And as in LFG everyone is going to select leader because they all think it will let them get in faster. <br />

Really, coupled with the extremely tempting prospect of being able to troll 24 people at once by simply pulling trash during a boss and the high possibility of ending up with either a dummy or super elitist raid leader, this promises to be a hilarious failure of a concept.<br />

<br />
This is in place so people dont just join a raid and leave after the first boss because their item didnt drop and que up again. It will still probably happen if its the person's first time doing the boss in the week, but it defiantly cuts down on it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm with you on this. It should be if you got loot off that boss, not if you got loot or not. This discourages people to use this after beating the raid once, even if they got 0 loot the whole run. Really disagree with this loot rule.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It is impossible to ninja loot in the dungeon finder, or the raid finder.<br />
<br />
Ninja looting involves grabbing loot outside the rules. It is impossible to break the rules of automated NBG. It's completely possible to snap the spirit of certain rulesets over one's knee in the dungeon finder, but if you go in not expecting that spirit to be present (which you should, in my opinion) and just look out for your two specs, expecting that everyone else is, it's a perfectly fair rules set.</div></div><hr />

Main Spec Item does not drop but the Offspec item does. You win the roll, and get the item. You queue up again later in the week and Boss 1 drops the Main Spec Item, you are unable to roll on it because you got the offspec item off that boss. Perhaps people will save their loot rolls for main specs, at least for a little while.</div></div><hr />

Better then having people join the raid, kill the first boss, having their loot not drop, leave the raid and que again AND it makes people think twice about rolling on Offspec gear.</div></div><hr />

They need tighter restrictions on the loot system. I can just see raiders going crazy over loot rolls and grabbing stuff that's not their spec simply because they can't get anything else from that boss for the rest of the week. The bag of loot or not getting loot saved if you didn't receive gear would be ideal.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hmm, I dunno. The queue times for lfd are long enough to put people off doing that unless the group is full of idiots, or people wiping the raid on purpose. 250 VPs for completing the dungeon is a good incentive to stay and finish it and just queue again afterwards to get another shot at that boss. If they implement it as is it will be people will run the raid once, get no loot and think &quot;why do it again for VPs I can get from 5 mans? I wont get any loot :(&quot;</div></div><hr />

I'm pretty sure that the Looking for Raid and Regular/Heroic versions are completely seperate.<br />
<br />
The dungeon finder looks like its going to be awesome, I was skeptical at first thinking people could farm gear but its looking pretty awesome now. Can't wait.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ninja looting involves grabbing loot outside the rules. It is impossible to break the rules of automated NBG. It's completely possible to snap the spirit of certain rulesets over one's knee in the dungeon finder, but if you go in not expecting that spirit to be present (which you should, in my opinion) and just look out for your two specs, expecting that everyone else is, it's a perfectly fair rules set.<br />
<br />
<br />
The problem with this train of thought though, is how a majority of the community views these things. Bliz needs to realize that a majority of raiders use some sort of Main spec before Offspec before AH/disenchant spec system. This is to ensure their raiders gear up the specs they are using first.<br />
<br />
For example, I play a shammy and we have an enhance shammy in our raid group. Now if we all went by the way Blizzard sees things, no one would be able to actual gear up the spec they are fulfilling for the raid first. This is turn would make people have to spend who knows how long until the whole group actually has the gear they need for their main specs.<br />
<br />
Think outside the box on something before you go on with the whole: It is impossible to ninja loot in the dungeon finder, or the raid finder. Think on why someone would make such a statement before going that route.</div></div><hr />

Ok, now realize that the &quot;community at large&quot; is not, like said guild raid, invested in the pace of one's/your gearing up, nor am I invested in theirs.<br />

Honestly, if you are doing LFR with loot as the *primary* motivation (of COURSE it's going to be among your motivations) &quot;ur doin' it wrong&quot;, IMO. The loot is a bonus after seeing content that your guild/lifestyle prohibited you from seeing before...<br />

And every one of those individuals has the &quot;same chance&quot; that you do. Who cares which one of them ends up with the item? It's you vs &quot;insert class spread&quot; number of people (as it pertains to loot), whether they are together or not.<br />

kill the boss - the loot that dropped is what you can roll for, you cant kill it 50 times hoping for your loot to drop and passing. boss will drop items you can roll for once a week... so why bother &quot;saving&quot; your roll. expect a lot of retards rolling on items out of their spec... this feature will bring more QQ to the forums than the real ID fiasco did</div></div><hr />

There is no raid lockout for LFR raids. You would just auto-pass on loot from whatever bosses you killed already that week. So you could just keep re-queueing until you clear the place.</div></div><hr />

Well I think you completely missed the point. I don't expect anyone to pass on things as a rule. If the those people were all randoms with 6 of them eligible for a piece and 2 of them have it or out gear it those 2 are much less prone to roll on it than a guild that builds groups of raiders + alts in a stacked attempt to max out their eligibility for a certain armor class and they all roll need. With this thing not sharing a lockout, if you don't think guilds are going to do this in an attempt to gear up and get set bonuses faster then we will have to disagree. To clarify: The raid finder will supposedly try to balance the armor classes in the raids but you can join as a raid group if you want with all of your normal caster raiders, and then all of the melee raiders on caster alts. You just went from having a moderate chance of getting gear to almost none. That's just my opinion though and to be honest I really don't care to argue about it, I just wanted to clarify because I am not naive.</div></div><hr />

ya,i mean.i said when i first heard about it i already knew it was going to fail seeing as how pugs cant even do heroics without people leaving after 1 wipe,pvp champs rocking there full vicious glad gear and pulling garbage dps.but in reality,it would be kinda nice on the weeks i dont get to raid to be able to just queue up on a alt or somethin and go do a raid when im really bored<br />
<br />
see as how cataclysm didnt really bring much else to do.plus it means i could actually raid more then 5 mans on my alts because my server is like really bad and probably wipes on shannox in pugs</div></div><hr />

Most pugs got rolled, especially on the first boss in ZG. Now, most pugs have no issues, as we all know the fights. Occasionally, you'll get someone, possibly a tank/healer who doesn't know the mechanics but for the most part, they hardly require much effort anymore. Random raid finder will be the same. At first, it will be complete chaos, and unless you get a group of people who know the fights via normal mode (i.e. a group of guild mates) who are leading the way, there will be countless rage quits. Then over the weeks, as everyone gets to know the encounters (mainly those who didn't read up on them and learn by wiping/being carried) they'll go from chaos, to a challenge, to effortless to &quot;zomg this is my 5th run this week gearing all my alts&quot;.</div></div><hr />

This provides an opportunity for more casual players who want to see the raid content and phat lewt but don't have the time commitment to participate in a good raiding guild. However, I don't understand the loot rules here at all. You automatically pass on any loot from a boss you already downed, even if you didn't get anything? This will cause everyone to roll need on everything they can, regardless of what it is.If they changed the rules to if you win something, you auto-pass on that boss for the rest of the week. This would prevent players from rolling on gear they don't actually need. But I can't imagine Blizzard hasn't thought of this already, so I wonder why they are doing the loot rules as they are....</div></div><hr />

What a SHITTY system.<br />
<br />
If you opt to drop the group, get a deserter buff for an hour, queue again and try your luck, well, that's your choice. But it is a STUPID one. Instead of wasting your time hopeing for an ideal group, which you will probably never get in 25mans, kill the boss and you have a chance to actually get some loot.<br />
<br />
I suggest blizz increase the number of drops from each boss by one.</div></div><hr />

It's not uncommon in random heroic groups for people to wait for MS rolls or ask if they can roll OS. Occasionally I get a greedy person, but I really haven't had much trouble with this. It hurts everyone's chances for MS loot if they roll on OS, so logically it makes sense to all agree to let MS need first...<br />

Random heroic groups are 5 people. That's the definitive detail to answer your question.</div></div><hr />

Then we'd have mostly-full (or full, if that's allowed) guild groups chain-running it until their entire raiding core, or at least those who have useful 2/4pc bonuses, are fully kitted out in them. Ow, that'd be a LOT of raiding, but if heroics are still locked out first week, you know that's where many guilds will be spending their time.<br />
It could possibly be changed in the future, allowing alts and newer raiders to gear up more quickly, but it would just be abused like mad if it were allowed from day one.</div></div><hr />

Why should you get multiple chances at raid loot just because its LFR. Real raiders don't get multiple chances at loot each week. If people actually cared about seeing the content and not gear like they say they do this wouldn't be a problem. People just want loot.

Last I remembered, they said they're aiming the loot to be better than normal firelands, but weaker than heroic firelands loot, though that is also subject to change when they made that announcement.<br />
<br />
IMO, I don't like this system either. Until life stopped me from raiding til now, I've only managed to grab 2 pieces of loot from the actual raid instances due to terrible luck. And with my bro, he hardly ever saw spell leather go their way as well in the raids he's been in.<br />
<br />
Though I am very interested in getting to see content, I'm just as interested in getting in getting my character gear. Why would I want to go after the first few times if I feel like I'm not going to see my loot, and when they do, I lose? It'll be like the troll instances again: Fun for the first few times, but it bores you to death when the only thing you're going in there for is points and loot when it ceases to be a challenge.</div></div><hr />

Because the Raid Finder acts exactly like the Dungeon Finder, with the exception that it puts players in a 25-man raid instead of a 5-man dungeon. <br />
<br />
The gear I receive from the Dungeon Finder is currently worse than current raid gear. I knew that the gear I recieved from running the Raid Finder would be worse than running the instance on Normal or Heroic. I expected the rules to be copied from the Dungeon Finder almost exactly, as it dramatically improves the amount of players running the instance, as they have more reason to (gear and VP, as opposed to just VP).<br />
<br />
<br />
Blizzard gives really bad players and people with no time to devote to a game that's expected to take time their own tier so you get to see the content and you still complain.<br />
Because no-one's ever going to complete their Easy tier set, because players running the instance on Easy difficulty are regarded as less worthy of tier than players running raids on Normal or Heroic difficulty.<br />
<br />
I feel sad for how Blizzard are treating this community.<br />

Possibly not as dramatic as ilvl1, but they should make pvp items count less for ilvl when queueing for the LFR.<br />

I get the frustration how not getting loot works (every weekly reset starts with me not getting Shannox boots after all) but this is how raids always worked.<br />
<br />
True, however, we get to do that once a week.<br />
<br />
This is for one raid, with one chance for loot for boss. If this is going to be a popular thing to do, the raid needs to either A) Be done as quick or just as quick as a regular sized heroic or B) Be useful for gathering loot. Otherwise, this is going to have a big decline throughout the week unless they also plan to change the way we gather Valor points.<br />
<br />
Upon retrospect, I guess the chances of getting stuff here can increase as the patch's life continues onward: Seeing as this could be a good tool to help players learn the encounter for normal instances, this could branch off to get people to form PuGs on Normal, while using the Raid finder to gather stuff to fill in the gaps in their gear and practice.<br />
<br />
I guess only time will let us know, or maybe the PTR if it stays up for a while to simulate it. :S<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
So wait you can roll on loot once a week? Say I roll for a cape and lose, I can't roll on anything else till raid reset?<br />
<br />
You get the chance to roll on loot on that one specific boss per week. Since this boss will feature 7-8 bosses, you're getting 7-8 chances to get loot in that week.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Achaman</div><div class="date">2011-09-30, 03:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Q. How will loot be distributed? A. Automatic rolls and the Need Before Greed loot rules will apply in Raid Finder raids, just as they do in Dungeon Finder instances. Also, while Dungeon Finder raids aren’t locked, you are only eligible for loot from a boss once per week. This means that if you were present for the defeat of a boss, whether you receive loot or not, then you will automatically pass on loot that drops during later attempts on that boss during the same week. Q. How will Raid Finder loot differ? A. Loot acquired through the Raid Finder, including tier set pieces, will be of a lower item level than items acquired from normal or heroic mode versions of the Dragon Soul raid, and its appearance may differ. Also, there are certain items, as well as components for legendary weapons, which will not drop in Raid Finder raids. While individual bosses will not yield Valor Points as they would in other versions of the raid, you can still earn 250 Valor Points for beating the final boss in each wing of the instance. Tier armor that drops in Raid Finder raids still provides set bonuses, and those bonuses are compatible with the higher item level versions of the armor available in the normal and heroic mode versions of the raid. None of these tier sets will be available for purchase from a vendor via Valor Points. whats the damn point in joining it then id rather not get a raid than have to deal with that crap i couldnt care less about progress im in it for the loot</div></div><hr />

Yes and no. The first time you down that boss in a week, regardless of what drops, no more loot drops from that boss for you. If it drops all stuff you can't use, that boss is all locked up for the week, so you can't roll on the cape he drops the next time around, even though it's an upgrade for you.</div></div><hr />

yep, unless they restrict the loot rolls on &quot; mainspec&quot; you'll have shit like this going around.<br />
You can't put Master looter with Cross realm and people queuing as a group.<br />
So you'll end up with everyone rolling on everything, or simply people rolling for offspec gear when some won't even have it for MS. Unless they restrict so that people can roll depending on the spec the joined as, it will be a big mess.</div></div><hr />

Everyone will run as soon as it comes out.<br />
And then everyone will run as late into the week as possible.<br />
And then everyone will run it in the middle day of the week.<br />
And so on. Zeno's Paradox style. It won't matter when you run it. You'll almost definitely have people rolling against you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The main reason for this is to keep people from farming the raid for drops. An example: If I want the trinket off of the first boss, and it doesn't drop/I don't win the roll, I drop group and wait out the debuff, then re-queue.<br />
<br />
I'm wondering if there's a &quot;join as group&quot; option. If my 10-man is a few people short, and can't find a reasonable replacement, it'd be great if we could form the core of a random raid group. While it would be slightly lesser in ilvl, the set bonuses would still be there, as well as filling the slots in other places we just hadn't gotten drops for yet.</div></div><hr />

I doubt you value the replay value of storyline highly enough to continue using the Raid Finder past the sixth week. I'm interested to see storyline. I'm also interested in going back there to get upgrades, after I've seen the storyline. Otherwise, I've been waiting for a long time to see the raid once, and then go back to farming the Dungeon Finder.</div></div><hr />

Let players experience the fights and get the practice to do the real thing 2. Let players that are not in guilds that raid experience the content and the story. I for one am totally for it even if they didnt give us anything for the raid just so I can go out and experience the story.<br />
Right, because doing something faceroll is &quot; experiencing raiding&quot; ? <br />
VOA/BH is raiding then. And those are some of the easiest bosses, and I still see some fail in them sometimes.<br />
<br />
The problem with 1. --&gt; once you done it, you have experience it. ALL the other times you WILL do it, will be 95% for the loot, with your main, or with alts.<br />
2. Story the first time is nice yes, but you will be bored after a couple runs. once you're trying to gear some alts, you won't give a damn about it, like everything else. Ultimately, this tool is nothing more than easier raid loot once people have experience content.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Firebert</div><div class="date">2011-09-30, 03:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The main reason for this is to keep people from farming the raid for drops. An example: If I want the trinket off of the first boss, and it doesn't drop/I don't win the roll, I drop group and wait out the debuff, then re-queue.<br />
<br />
I'm wondering if there's a &quot;join as group&quot; option. If my 10-man is a few people short, and can't find a reasonable replacement, it'd be great if we could form the core of a random raid group. While it would be slightly lesser in ilvl, the set bonuses would still be there, as well as filling the slots in other places we just hadn't gotten drops for yet.<br />
People dropping after the first boss is fine. Queue times will be far less than current Dungeon Finder times.<br />
And the Raid Finder is 25 man only, and locked to the Need Before Greed system, and all the other things that come with the Dungeon Finder, except in 25-man goodness.</div></div><hr />

But what happens if you can only do one or two bosses? Does this mean that next time you queue you will have to do those bosses again? Over and over, each time you queue, never reaching the end because of time constraints? I hope it saves your progress and slots you into a raid that has cleared the bosses you have already done - at least for that week. Otherwise, casual players (NOT bads; players with very little recreational time, who have work and family responsibilities) won't get to experience the entire instance and will be grinding against the same one or two bosses over and over each time they queue. That's just not fun. :/</div></div><hr />

<br />
and tell me friend, how do pvp stats not equal 0 stats in pve? last time i checked, the only good thing resiliance was in pve, was for tanks to midigate damage.. oh wait, that was in wotlk, they changed it. now it does nothing, nada, zip, for pve. pvp items shouldn't count towards the ilvl requirements for dungeons, raids or anything for that matter, as they are not itemized to take on that content. yes, you can do 5 mans with it, but healing a pvp geared tank is horrible, i had one tonight, it was dreadful. not to mention, any time i do a BH25, which is not often since i prefer to just do class runs with my guild, the pvp heroes are the once scoring 12-15k dps, yeah... it sure ain't affecting their performance at all, right ? my ret spec, an average level of ~359 beats most puggers in BH, many of them super bads in pve gear, others, even worse in pvp gear.<br />
<br />
they made 2 seperate sets for pve and pvp for a reason, cause pve superheroes in vanilla owned everyone with their superior gear, so they added pvp gear in tbc and made changes to how things work... pvp gear was made to pvp, not to pve, it shouldn't be used unless there is no alternative, or simply cause blizzard screwed up raid itemization, and pvp gear somehow is better (leather bracers for tanks etc, among other feral tank itemization fails)</div></div><hr />

Because item level is not solely used in PvE.<br />
Because resilience currently does nothing, doesn't mean the stats are worth zero on an item level scale. If resilience were worth zero on an item level scale, an item with 2 resilience and an item with 2k resilience with all the same stats would be worth the same. And I'm sure which one a PvPer would take.<br />

<br />
No it isn't. Obviously I'd already be rolling need on the tanking loot. I can't need roll more, and me needing doesn't give me any priority on the item over all the DPS who will also need it. <br />
<br />
Across 6 tanks I've seriously never won a tanking drop in a random dungeon ever, which is why I never run them as pugs anymore. What incentive is there for me to tank these knowing I'm going to have to contest every tanking drop against at least 15 other people, all but one of them not having any reason to roll against me but doing so because they can?<br />
<br />
The LFD loot system is flawed and screws over tanks, it mostly doesn't matter because nobody really cares about 5 man loot. But it needs tweaking for a raid setting.</div></div><hr />

i know resilience counts towards the item budget on the item in question, how ever, when huge amount of the item budget is put on resilience, and resilience is of no use in pve, those stats effectively = 0 in a pve enviorment... so any ilvl calculator for raids/dungeons should exclude pvp items to be counted towards the requirements, as they are simply not really providing the full amount of stats for pve compared to the ilvl they have... since resilience does nothing in pve<br />

yes, ofc no restriction would means farming it until you get what you want. But remember, it would only be 7 times a week. So allowing that would mean that you have 7 chances per boss for a loot.<br />
But on the other hand, doing a boss at the end of the week, and having a useful item going to none or someone's offspec because all that would benefit it can't roll is rather stupid. It will push people to need on anything they can wear, and I don't even want to imagine Tier tokens, that everyone will need even if they have it already, for their offspec and pretend they didn't have it yet.<br />
Overall, there is a lot of work to be done about those ideas and loot rules, in order to have something fair and successful. But I'm sure as the PTR will go on, things will change.</div></div><hr />

VP caps out at 980, I'd much rather suffer throu another za/zg (or one of the new three heroics) vs run a raid with 24 random people for my VP. Cause im pretty sure i could get 250 VP faster with za/zg then i could doing LFR. So what are the incentives to actually use the feature?<br />

I know its still in PTR thou, so im hoping they fix it.

As a PVE player, after I raid with my guild there isn't much to do for the rest of week. This gives something else to do, and with no lockout, you don't really have to worry if the raid is going to fail/quit after the first boss, all you have to do is pickup another group. Not allowing loot for a boss that has already been killed makes sense, as it avoids gear farming without stopping players from re-doing/advancing the raid with different players. Also, I don't think that out of the 25 players in the raid all of them will be PUGs, people will probably party up with other people before joining the RF. For large guilds it will be even better, just form a raid with as many players as you can, join RF and do as many bosses as you can. If people leave, invite someone else in, those who left can join again later to try to kill the bosses they didn't have time to.<br />
<br />
BTW, it seems that the mostly likely date for the patch release is 29/11 (or 11/29, depending where you're from). Why? Well, Blizzard is going to release a Brazilian portuguese language pack and have just officially announced pre-orders for retail versions of the game, and though no official release date has been given, all Brazilian websites taking pre-orders have put 29/11 (a tuesday, when patch are usually released) as probable release date. Since the pack is expected to come with patch 4.3, well... it would be the best guess.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Exactly. If it is a very special form of raiding, why apply some silly rule to discourage people from the get go? Yeah, sure, I want to train on new encounters but I want to gear up as well, and loot is subpar to other forms of raiding, so why the restriction? And I too had in mind to use LFR more times then just once per week and if indeed there is valor reward but zero loot past the first run - come on, who in the right mind would do this only for the valors?<br />

Oh right, Blizzard repeatedly said they want everyone to see everything they create. So no worries, you will see Deathwing many times but you will never get anything - the first time you will be outrolled by 24 people and the next time you will not be eligible for loot.<br />
<br />
Ok, it's PTR, it can and it will change before 4.3 - hopefully this will be one of the changes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well I don't see the point in you guys complaining over the loot rules. This is not the donguen finder it's for raid same as all the other raids. These rules are same as if you were in normal raid with your guild or your server pug, if you didn't get loot off a 1st boss in your guild run don't you have to wait whole week to kill the same boss for your turn At loot on the same boss? So it's the same thing that applies here wait another week for it to reset.</div></div><hr />

I know and I didn't want to turn out a loot whore, I really meant from the gear up perspective: Blizzard wants us to train and gear up through LFR, and then head into normal/heroic version. So, zero loot after the first run is really a bit extreme. But, yeah, Dragon Soul is 8 bosses? How many items drop now on 25man, per boss? 5-6? So, there is a chance one could get at least something, once a week.</div></div><hr />

That is not the goal of LFR tho. It's to get the people who have no time ( I am guessing play 15 min a day now), play at weird hours or are too stupid to get anywhere in current content to be able to *see* the raids. The loot is just a little extra.<br />

It would make sense because lets say for example you fight a boss and your healing dagger drops but the idiot rogue needs it, wins the roll and drops group before he noticed it was a healing dagger.. LFR is a raid in a LFD shell so why should the loot rules be like an actual raid, considering nothing else is?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree on that. This would keep lowest represented roles like tanks constantly active in Raid Finder simply because of the fact that they would keep returning and do bosses untill they got what they come for. <br />
<br />
The current state of this system encourages everyone to each boss only once and drop it. I wont pull out numbers out of my ass but I dont need them to safely proclaim that perfect ratio of tanks:DPS:Healers is non existant. Otherwise CoT would never come to be.</div></div><hr />

I know that raises loot reward concerns (namely, an established raid with ML could screw over a PUG player on loot)... but they could design around that, where you lose master-looter privileges the minute you add a PUG player to your group.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Antherios</div><div class="date">2011-09-30, 07:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Reasons why this is going to get hard to stand <br />
<br />
1&gt; PvP Gear: When you zone in, and you find out that half of the dps and half of the healers are on PvP gear, shit will happen. Healers going OOM mid combat, dps doing 10k, etc etc. <br />
<br />
2&gt; Finding a Raid Leader with patience: It just seems really odd for me that someone will want to go thru the whole problem of explaining fights, assigning roles, calling out directions and correcting mistakes if they dont win absolutely nothing extra. Finding good raid leaders is going to be incredible hard, and the average raid leader will be your normal guy in blues, trying crazy strats and raging about no one paying him attention. <br />
<br />
3&gt; Ninjaing: This will be THE issue, people rolling on MS, OS and even the third spec they dont own will be really common. Warriors rolling on agi mail, tanks needing on 2handers. This happens every day on the LFD tool, and it will happen on the LFR tool. <br />
<br />
4&gt; The Average Pug: Really bad players will get in the system, players that stand in fire, players that dont listen to advices, players that wear the wrong kind of armor, that gems old vanilla gems, and doenst enchant their gear. Douches pulling to wipe the raid, people breaking CCs earlier, etc etc. All this will be bread of every day in the LFR tool. <br />
<br />
5&gt; Managing a 25man raid without vent: People going AFK mid fight or before a pull, people disconnecting, some people pcs wont be able to handle 25mans correctly, so they will lag a lot. Not being able to actively communicate orders thru voice, will make things incredibly hard, because how will you tell your raidmates that X guy has to get out of fire, if that guy just doesnt read the chat? <br />
<br />
So.. i foresee 2 scenarios happening <br />
<br />
1. Blizz will make the current raid in LFR incredibly easy to absurd levels (not dying and feeling godlike even standing in fire). So free gear for everyone and 0 learning at all.<br />
2. Blizz will make the current raid in LFR hard (not hard like normal or hardmode, but you get it), and only 1 raid every blue moon will be able to clear the whole raid without disbanding. <br />
<br />
Hopefully blizz can sort this somehow!</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Prokne</div><div class="date">2011-09-30, 07:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't really understand why people are upset with the 1 chance at loot per boss per week. Its the same as a normal raid, you don't get more than 1 chance per week to get loot. I guess everyone who is upset about it wanted to chain run LFR for tier or stuff they didnt get in previous raids but its not a huge loot grab, its like a normal raid except easier and with 24 random people from other servers. They could have made it like that but probably didnt because it drops tier and they didnt want guilds to force people to chain run them for a few weeks, plus the people dropping group when their item doesnt drop. I've also read several people arent going to use it because they will only get 1 set of drops per week that might get ninja'd. So you would rather have no loot at all than a chance to get something even if you might not win it?<br />
<br />
Also I'm not sure if Ill run it more than once since it will probably take longer than a 5 man to get VP but if you get tired of the LFD dungeons or there is a higher VP cap from running LFR like ZA/ZG than I probably will.<br />
<br />
I think the solutions to people queuing with pvp gear would be for Blizzard to stop using avg ilvl as the requirement for entry. There should be a DPS/Healing/Tanking rating that is a mixture of your DPS/AP/SP/Haste/Crit?Dodge/Block/Mastery/whatever stats are important for pve for your class. I dont think it would be too hard to do since those stats are already calculated in your character view someone just has to determine which stats should be weighted more than others.<br />
<br />
Also even though I rarely see anyone need on offspec loot in LFD when someone needs for mainspec they need to change Need before Greed to only allow you to need for gear that is useable by your current spec. Should be this way in LFD also.</div></div><hr />

(same goes offc for healer loot to healers &amp; dps loot to dpsers). I've been plenty frustrated in the past by taking up the tank role only to have tank loot ninja'd by dpsers and/or (pala) healers. And now you think i'm gonna join a raid finder when i'll be rolling vs potentially 23 ninja's? And when you see no tanks are joining your queue i bet you're gonna offer them a crappy bag with junk for completing the raid and having all the loot you came for ninja'd away from you!I think not. I think i will simply queue as DPS and need on TANK gear just like everyone does, untill the day Blizzard gives us what we deserve.</div></div><hr />

Or more likely, it is just more rational to queue for LFR just on MON/TUE to greatly increase your chances to get the loot by maximizing the number of people, who autopass.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ninja looting involves grabbing loot outside the rules. It is impossible to break the rules of automated NBG. It's completely possible to snap the spirit of certain rulesets over one's knee in the dungeon finder, but if you go in not expecting that spirit to be present (which you should, in my opinion) and just look out for your two specs, expecting that everyone else is, it's a perfectly fair rules set.<br />
<br />
Not everyone raids to get offspec gear.<br />
<br />
It's not about the rules. It's about people trying to get some gear but there are 10 others rolling for it (while they probably don't need it or are not even going to use it) because they have 2 or 3 specs. It's near impossible to get it. Especially since it's crossrealm so you always have different people in your raid.<br />
At least in a pug you can make your own rules and have reliable leaders so you actually have a chance to get some gear that you really need.<br />
<br />
At least it's by the rules, only very frustrating and that will cause problems.<br />

I don't know if they do, but the system should check whether all of the roles eligible for the loot already received loot from that boss and then re-enable their need-button! I'd feel cheated otherwise..<br />

They say that the penalty is something of a longer duration than the dungeon finder deserter debuff, don't they? So I hope that the raid penalty will persist longer than the actual raid will be, so people think twice before leaving :)</div></div><hr />

All tank gear gets tagged &quot;tank gear&quot;, all healer gear gets tagged &quot;healer gear&quot;, all dps gear gets tagged &quot;dps gear&quot;. Some gear will have more than one tag; a str/stam mast/exp belt would be both tank &amp; dps. I have limited class/roles itemisation knowledge, i never play casters, so can't spell out all the rules, but stuff like &quot;sta/str gear with haste or cit is dps gear, sta/str gear with dodge or parry is tank gear&quot; shouldn't be too hard for Blizzard to set up a rulebook on.Then, when the item drops, only people who are filling that role for the current raid gets to need. Not everyone who can equip it. Tank gear drops, only the tanks get to need. If you're dpsing but would like it for your offspec, you get to greed. If you dont want it at all, you disenchant (or pass if no DE in raid, unless Blizz is willing to just let us DE gear even if RNG doesn't put an enchanter in raid).The general rulebook should be easy to set up, some exceptions need to be added so that e.g. blood dk tanks can need on dps weaponry (only due to Blizzard refusing to create true DK tank weapons; i mean it's not like they're still doing it for warrs &amp; pala's even after equalising 1h tank &amp; dps weapon attack speed right? Oh wait...).Maybe Blizzard can stop putting 100% of their time &amp; effort into catering to the needs of &quot;the casual player&quot; and put 10% of their effort into catering to the needs of people that could &amp; would carry these random raid finder groups, if only they wouldn't get screwed in the ass by Blizzard on every turn.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you go in there as an experienced raider it will be so frustrating. PuG's where everyone had the right achievements and gear were already very frustrating for me 90% of the time. Imagine how bad LFR will be.<br />
I don't understand how this will improve the game. Yes, you can raid. Will it be fun? Probably not most of the time.<br />
<br />
Games who require a lot of teamwork (25 people is a big group and you need some good coordination unlike many other games) don't really work with tools like this. 5 mans can already be a pain. And when I play other games like Black Ops: Zombies where you only have group with 4 players 99% of the time it doesn't work with random people while you barely need teamwork.<br />
<br />
I just can't believe this is a the right direction for a game like this.<br />

Attention: LFR is optional That doesn't make it any better. And that doesn't mean people can't give their opinions about it.<br />
<br />
People want hardmodes to be nerfed to clear it. Attention: Hardmodes are optional.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And should never have been touched.<br />
<br />
I can fully understand nerfing normals:<br />
<br />
1. It allows a great deal of people that have not experienced successfull fireland raiding to give it a go, see the encounters, have fun with 'm.<br />
2. It allows people that have fallen behind on gear and would struggle to step into the next expansion, to catch up and be fully prepared and able to step into the next expansion.<br />
3. Dedicated raiders dont care about them; there was no prestige or whatnot in having cleared firelands on normal even before nerf.<br />
<br />
Nerfing heroics is just shit. No one wants this. They've taken all the prestige and sence of pride heroic raiders had for having achieved a certain progress in heroics. And for what? For nothing.<br />
<br />
I'm in a guild, we had cleared some bosses on heroic pre-nerf. There was a sence of... achievement, pride, whenever we first killed a heroic boss. &quot;Yay, progress&quot;. Now it's all gone. We progress further and it just feels shit. &quot;Oh look we killed this heroic boss, ah well&quot;. Why did Blizzard take this away from dedicated players? I have no idea.<br />
<br />
I'm getting real fed up with this shit. I fully support allowing casual players to experience raid content, it just pisses me off Blizzard does it at the cost of what dedicated raiders hold dearest: the pride &amp; satisfaction of achieving progress.<br />

Reminds me about this time I saw a 'tank' trying to tank a random cata hc, wearing cloth gear (with intel and spirit on), because it has STAMINA, and tanks NEED STAMINA .. I almost cried it was so hilarious (I did actually try explaining to him for the next 30-40 minutes that he really really shouldnt wear cloth), ofc the vote to kick wasnt working, and thankfully my gf is a great healer and was in the run, the 'tank' ofc insisted that he was amazing, and that wearing cloth because it has stamina was totally correct (it was a warrior btw) .. wish I could watch the LFR that this particular 'tank' joins :D</div></div><hr />

All tank gear gets tagged &quot;tank gear&quot;, all healer gear gets tagged &quot;healer gear&quot;, all dps gear gets tagged &quot;dps gear&quot;. Some gear will have more than one tag; a str/stam mast/exp belt would be both tank &amp; dps. I have limited class/roles itemisation knowledge, i never play casters, so can't spell out all the rules, but stuff like &quot;sta/str gear with haste or cit is dps gear, sta/str gear with dodge or parry is tank gear&quot; shouldn't be too hard for Blizzard to set up a rulebook on.Then, when the item drops, only people who are filling that role for the current raid gets to need. Not everyone who can equip it. Tank gear drops, only the tanks get to need. If you're dpsing but would like it for your offspec, you get to greed. If you dont want it at all, you disenchant (or pass if no DE in raid, unless Blizz is willing to just let us DE gear even if RNG doesn't put an enchanter in raid).The general rulebook should be easy to set up, some exceptions need to be added so that e.g. blood dk tanks can need on dps weaponry (only due to Blizzard refusing to create true DK tank weapons; i mean it's not like they're still doing it for warrs &amp; pala's even after equalising 1h tank &amp; dps weapon attack speed right? Oh wait...).Maybe Blizzard can stop putting 100% of their time &amp; effort into catering to the needs of &quot;the casual player&quot; and put 10% of their effort into catering to the needs of people that could &amp; would carry these random raid finder groups, if only they wouldn't get screwed in the ass by Blizzard on every turn.<br />
<br />
That's how the Need-before-Greed system should've worked from the beginning. They could add this feature in one day. Seriously. It would be ridiculously easy. If I had access to their item database and knew how they were going to store/access the role tags, I could write up code in less than 10 minutes which would automagically add appropriate tags to all gear ever created based on which stats were on it. They'd have to hand tag 30 specs with the appropriate role tag (15 minutes tops), and insert the 2-3 line role check code next to the &quot;armor class&quot; check when the roll window comes up. Bam, done. Literally, one day tops, but more likely just an hour or two since I doubt they employ scrub coders.</div></div><hr />

This is not the donguen finder it's for raid same as all the other raids. These rules are same as if you were in normal raid with your guild or your server pug, if you didn't get loot off a 1st boss in your guild run don't you have to wait whole week to kill the same boss for your turn At loot on the same boss? So it's the same thing that applies here wait another week for it to reset.<br />
I have to disagree with you on this. If you PuG a heroic with your friends on YOUR server, you are locked out of that heroic after you clear it, UNLESS you que for a random dungeon in LFG and happen to get it. You are able to get gear from it each time you go through and gear up your main, alts, friends, whoever. In a raid, you are also bound by the same rules. You are locked to each boss once per week and get one shot at gear. The ideology behind it transfer over that if you are going to be doing a raid over and over again for SUB-PAR loot, you should be able to have a shot at rolling each time. I mean, who gives a shit if you can farm the raid? Who loses in the end if you can constantly get gear from the raid? The guy who constantly leaves after the first boss? Eventually he gets all his drops he wanted and starts sticking it out for his 250 VP and LFR achieves.<br />
<br />
I honestly just cannot contemplate why people would be against getting to roll more than once per week. If you have gotten gear from that boss, I completely understand not being able to roll anymore. I could also understand if you only were allowed to get loot once a week from a boss under the LFR system. As it currently stands, I believe it's going to frustrate a lot of people and they will lose more subscribers because of it.</div></div><hr />

You can like or hate it, the fact still remains they are putting lots of effort and thoughts into its implementation. I like the fact it will not have lock out as normal and heroic version. I'm excited about the fact it will be optimized for less coordinated and homogenous groups. I support the decision it will drop tier loot albeit with lower item level budget. I would still appreciate if killing the boss in LFR would grant kill achievement--obviously in this case major mechanics of boss must be retained but my understanding is that Blizzard is shooting for that anyway. All in all, 4.3 looks great from all angles.</div></div><hr />

I know exactly what you mean, Its not like it'll make everything super easy for us. if anything it would make the progression that much more smooth, Do dungeons until your ready to progress further. When dungeons become easy mode step into LFR and learn the fights, then the learning curve for all new raids will be much smoother and they'd be able to progress from LFR to normal to heroic. Considering the loot is worse then normal mode i just dont understand what the problem is with using them to gear. If you did use em to gear when you have nothing left then you could step into normals with the right ilvl. It'd cut down on people stepping into raids with pvp gear and stuff like that. I just dont understand why they're trying to gate LFR. It might not have a lock out but it might as well have one considering you only get loot once per boss per week. I feel if you could use them to gear/practice and learn the fights it would actually Promote raiding in guilds since everyone would have some way to practice without pissing off their guild by accidently causing a wipe on every pull because they didnt know. With LFR everyone would have a way to practice and would know the mechanics before stepping into normal.. thus promoting raiding. But thats just my opinion on it.<br />

Bliz needs to realize that a majority of raiders use some sort of Main spec before Offspec before AH/disenchant spec system. This is to ensure their raiders gear up the specs they are using first.For example, I play a shammy and we have an enhance shammy in our raid group. Now if we all went by the way Blizzard sees things, no one would be able to actual gear up the spec they are fulfilling for the raid first. This is turn would make people have to spend who knows how long until the whole group actually has the gear they need for their main specs.Think outside the box on something before you go on with the whole: It is impossible to ninja loot in the dungeon finder, or the raid finder. Think on why someone would make such a statement before going that route.I am with you on this but it is different when you raid with your guild and when you raid with random people. For example let say that I am a tank and I have a very good gear as tank than my dps spec. Don't you think it would be better to join as tank because this way I will help most the random raid instead of join as dps? Also not to mention that tanks and healers already have priority on their guilds so they will get fast their normal raid tank gear. So what they are really after, is the off spec gear. but if tanks and healers have to go dps in order to get off spec gear who is gonna tank and heal?I think raid finder will be the &quot;off spec&quot; run mostly, cause everyone wants for their main spec the improved loot from normal/heroic modes and they will not bother for a lower ilvl. And I say everyone must help the raid group with the spec they know better and the spec they are good regardless what loot the go after</div></div><hr />

<br />
In 4.3, you can purchase T12 set pieces and the &quot;old&quot; valor gear using justice points, all of 378 item level. In addition to that, you also have the new heroic 5 man dungeons offering what appears to also be 378 loot.<br />

It is the single concentrated substance to why Blizz made me stop playing this game. I would have gladly continued, if i could raid - if i could close that gap that is nigh impossible if you don't have the experience of CURRENT raids and the gear there of (even thought i had from all other). Now, you give people LFD for raids. Okay, people kind of suck ass in that regard, so it will be major wipefest, but some may pull through. Say what, you don't give kill achivements? Okay, because a achievement to kill a boss on NORMAL is so god damn hard. oh wait, it isn't. But that's all minor complaints. What is my HUGE gripe, is the fact of the loot. Now, Blizz, just how the f'ck did you think about this. you want Alts and people to get geared up - great. But you restrict they loot rolls to 1 per week from each boss. What? It's SUB-PAR loot, designed to be gained and people to get it - but you f'cking RESTRICT it? Blizz, are you aiming to make WoW worse? Because this is not a god damn improvement - this is literally holding to out-worn &quot;ideals&quot; and just making the game even worse. I could have re-subbed and raided with this shit, if i just fufilled it's god damn function that you claim - not some silly &quot;oh hey, we want to stick about for 2 expansions, derp derp derp&quot; - god damn.</div></div><hr />

Ok well you have fun stepping into a new raid instance that will have superior loot even on LFR-difficulty, tank for it, and have every piece of tankgear go to a dpser/healer because there's 2 dps dk's, 3 dps warriors, and a pala healer. Then come back and explain again how it's great that everyone has an equal shot at loot, no matter which role it is intended for &amp; which role you're filling in that raid. I'm tank main spec, i would like to tank for LFR-raids so that i can learn the fights &amp; get some tank upgrades, but with current loot rules, i'll only be queuing as dps. Why? Because it's easier &amp; more relaxed, especially for challenging encounters (dont think LFR groups are just gonna roflstomp over everything), and i'll get an equal shot at any tank loot that drops anyway.</div></div><hr />

I am sorry but I very much doubt a tank will join as a tank just for his off spec stuff. LFR is only useful for learning the fights and gearing up for normals/HC's. Why would a geared tank want to spend 4 hours in a LFR pug on the off chance that they get some loot for their OS (RNG and rolls). They are better off doing a few dungeons and buying stuff with valor or gold.<br />

LFR is only useful for learning the fights and gearing up for normals/HC's. Why would a geared tank want to spend 4 hours in a LFR pug on the off chance that they get some loot for their OS (RNG and rolls). They are better off doing a few dungeons and buying stuff with valor or gold.because with his guild there will be dps people that will get the dps drops...also the way the game works now is that only the high raid is worth doing so in 2 days of the week you go with your guild raid and then in other 5 days can do whatever you want...why not get the chance to go to LFR raid?You have to understand that everyone helps the raid with their way and their role.. so everyone deserves the loot. the reason that in guilds is main spec first, is because you will raid with the same people every week and this is the best way to have a well geared groups. Someone must tank, someone must heal and someone must dps..by choosing one role to help the raid group don't penalise you from getting loot for your off spec..every plate wearer can tank and dps, because someone chose to play his class only for one role doesn't take the right from other people to play all roles..and as Itold you now players can play two roles wit ha press of a button. And this most times happens in the same raid. So a tank you saw on first boss may go dps on second boss, a healer on first boss may go dps in a boss that needs more dps and less heal. Things changed in the game and now every class considered as multi-role. <br />
But thats what Need before Greed presently allows. If you can equip it, you can need it. So unfortunately the system is broken.indeed thats a bad design, they can easily put more rules on loot system to prevent such things, such as a mage that need on spirit gear for example.that also not considered as off - spec roll. but they have to keep the need for off-spec in my opinion</div></div><hr />

Think of it further and how it can live up for a long time. At the very start I am pretty sure that guilds will have a first run with LFR to get some gear for tanks - healers and dps of course and then they step into the normal raid..after a month or so, the good tanks and healers (good I mean players that they are in a guild and raid and know the fights, good for the current raid) they will have their gear ready and if their guilds will stop maybe the lfr raid and only step into normal mode. Those tanks and healers and dps will then use the LFR mostly to fill up their off spec in case they need it for their main raid.they have 2 options then1)	Join with their main spec and their best gear cause this is the way to help the most in the raid and complete it smooth and fast.2)	“forced” by loot system to join with their off spec, where they have lower gear and is not the specc they are practicing and they are best at..I know it is very bad feeling when you lose a roll but you have to think that off spec introduced for a reason and people can perform 2 roles everytime with a press of a button. Maybe later in the same raid a tank that needed on dps gear have to go dps in a fight cause only 1 tank needed… (Baelroc and Rhyolith comes in mind)<br />
<br />
Some things you need to be aware off:<br />
- Even at THE END of an expansion, many raiders are still waiting for that one piece of loot that has never dropped for them. Personally, i've never even seen the Beth trinket drop. Saying something like &quot;after a month they will have their gear ready&quot; is absurd.<br />
- Guilds will NOT be &quot;learning&quot; the encounters by using the LFR system. Guilds learn the encounters from watching kills on websites from the PTR servers, and will go directly for normals. <br />
- Most guild-raiders do not care all that much about their offspec, especially when they barely ever get to use it. Our warrior tank is always tanking (i'm the one who switches to DPS on one tank fights), he doesn't give a damn about his DPS spec or gear. Why would he? Our druid healer is ALWAYS healing. She doesn't care about feral or balance gear. Why would she? Only people like me, who tank half the fights &amp; dps the other, or our priest, who heals half the fights &amp; dpses the others, care slightly about their offspec. What 99% of raiders care about &amp; will put absurd amounts of effort into is maximising their main spec, getting that one piece of gear they're missing. If they have equal chance of getting it no matter if they're tanking/healing or dpsing, why would they tank/heal?<br />
<br />
I've explained already why the current loot system would be horrible for new content: all loot is better than what you have, but everyone can roll on everything as long as they can equip it, which will make lots of people who have mainspec tank or healer, will simply queue as DPS: easier, same chance at the loot you want.<br />
Why would the current loot system also be horrible for content you have on farm? Well, if they were to implement it for firelands now, i would likely want to join because there's still one item i need for my main spec (beth trinket), and several i need for my DPS spec. Why would i queue as tank? If i queue as DPS, i have an easier time, and if the trinket drops, i'll have an equal chance at getting it anyway.<br />
<br />
The current loot system pushes people to the DPS roll, because it's more comfortable to be in DPS roll especially in a pug, and you have the exact same chance at any piece of gear you would want, which is the only reason raiders would ever join the LFR system, and it doesn't matter at all which roll you're filling - everyone has an equal chance at getting it. This is how it's been now for ages in the LFG system, despite Blizzard adding that satchel of awesomeness, it will be even more so in a LFR system.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The problem is RNG. How long do you think it will take for people to get p.d off if they finally get x to drop after 15 kills and a tank gets it on the roll when it's a DPS item. People will abuse it. I guarantee that people will roll on anything and everything that they can. They are never going to see the people again, why must they care. Hell, as an enhance shammy, I may as well roll on elemental gear even if my OS is resto just in case I could use it in the future. If you want LFR to work, it needs to be need before green where need is MS. People who want it for OS can roll greed. They should just put greed above DE so stuff doesn't get sharded when people can use it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well.. At least Blizzard admits that 25 man is easier to manage than 10 man based on both class balance and connection quality... Still strange that 10 man raid is not getting better rewards in normal and heroics versions. <br />
<br />
And what on earth is that about ppl only be able to get 1 chance of drop per boss per week? Basicly there is zero reason to run the content again - other than to pay the repair bills. Not even Valor points. Again - the worst sytem Blizzard has ever created. It will create so much hate and issues between players.

There are a lot of games that have the classes completely seperate with roles. Aion have guardian and gladiator while warcraft have just warrior that can be both. Lotro have guardian and champion, and go on...in wow you are not tank/healer or dps you are warrior/paladin/priest/druid if you get the point.. and trust me Blizzard have thought of it much more than we discuss now and have it as it is. Again I am say no one is right or wrong, this is how game is. I for once I prefer the other style, I want to have different classes for different roles like aion and lotro and other games, but we don't have..<br />
<br />

The problem is RNG<br />
<br />
exactly...we wouldn't have that discusion if rewards wasn't about RNG. Imagine that every boss you kill gives you only tokens and every boss have a specific list of loots that you can buy with the tokens you get, problem solved. everyone will be equally rewarded. you ll get the trinket in 5 runs and the other guy will get in 5 runs also and you can have your priorities for choosing which role you will gear up first</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;Also, while Dungeon Finder raids aren’t locked, you are only eligible for loot from a boss once per week. This means that if you were present for the defeat of a boss, whether you receive loot or not, then you will automatically pass on loot that drops during later attempts on that boss during the same week.&quot;<br />
<br />
Meaning no loot twice on the same boss in raid finder obviously. But what about the same boss in regular or heroic? If you kill a boss in the RF and that weekend kill the boss on normal, are you ineligible for loot? Gonna have to log in to the WoW forums and ask &gt;.&lt;<br />

Only applies to the raid finder, I guess.</div></div><hr />

No, if I can't be bothered to heal raids, I shouldn't be allowed to roll need on the healing gear and vice versa. Again, what good is greed if everyone just needs? What would you use greed for? No point in it really. Just put need and DE and get it over with.</div></div><hr />

if he only needs loot from a certain boss he will quit anyway, I don't see how this will keep people from quiting... if he needs loot from other bosses he will stay, if he don't need loot from other bosses he will quit regardless if he can reque for his boss or not..</div></div><hr />

I know, and i said they will not. Guilds are not going to be waisting their raid hours learning or gearing up in the LFR easy-mode. They will use their raid hours immediately for normals.<br />
<br />
As of the rest of your post Irespect your opinion..I think there is not a right and wrong on this, it is how you see things..<br />
I respect your opinion aswell; but i really feel the current loot system removes any reason people would ever tank or heal for any pug, and that this is not an opinion. In any circumstance, whatever the reason you're joining the LFR system for, be it fun, gearing up, or learning fights, 99% of the people will always prefer to be in a DPS role. The best (and likely ONLY) way to convince dedicated healers or tanks to join the LFR system in that roll, is to give them priority on the loot for the role they're currently filling. As long as they dont give that, there's really NO reason to tank or heal, except for shorter queue times, which is not enough for 25man pug raids.<br />
<br />
<br />
as you said you are changing in fights..or maybe after a while you are bored tanking and wanna go dps and one dps of your guild wanna go tank...<br />
That's not how it works in raiding guilds, not when they're raiding current tier. One person is the &quot;main tank&quot;, who is always tank for every fight. One person is &quot;offtank&quot;, tanking for 2tank fights, dpsing for 1tank fights. A few people (depending 10/25) are main healers, they will always heal, no matter what. And then one or a few are healing/dpsing depending per fight. There's no &quot;oh i'm bored, can you please take over&quot;? Raiding guilds are well-balanced teams that know what to expect from eachother, that know who can do what, and that will try and stick to that as much as possible.<br />
<br />
<br />
my point of view is that as long as I help the raid with my character I deserve to roll for what is good for my character roles. Some people may not care for their off - spec but some people care. I said the way that in guilds the system is main spec before off spec is because you raid with same people every week and this is the best sytem for everyone to gear up quickly.I said is about how you see things...this tank also might get it after 15 kills...<br />
It's only common decency to give priority on loot to people that are currently filling that role. That's a common decency rule applied to any normal pug that is formed on any server. That's how the general player-base feel it should be. Yet Blizzard refuses to acknowledge this and force us to play with messed up loot rules that allow people to roll on gear for their offspec, even when they're not even filling that roll, even when there's people in that raid filling that role in their mainspec. Because they're too busy nerfing content and catering to the needs of the casual player.<br />
<br />
<br />
when you create a character you don't chose role you chose class and classes can perform more than one roles.this is how the game is. <br />
And when you get your character to a raiding level, you choose a main spec and an offspec. Just because this is not soft-ware enforced doesn't make it any less true. Anyone who raids regularely has a main spec, and an offspec.<br />
<br />
<br />
exactly...we wouldn't have that discusion if rewards wasn't about RNG. Imagine that every boss you kill gives you only tokens and every boss have a specific list of loots that you can buy with the tokens you get, problem solved. everyone will be equally rewarded. you ll get the trinket in 5 runs and the other guy will get in 5 runs also and you can have your priorities for choosing which role you will gear up first<br />
That would be awfull. It would basically mean that at the start of any tier, you can easily set out the entire path along which you're gonna gear up &quot;i'm gonna get that weapon, then i'll get that chestpiece, then that trinket&quot;, etc. Part of the fun &amp; excitement of going on a raid is hoping that the bosses will drop something nice for you, and you would remove that entirely. &quot;We're gonna kill 4 bosses tonight, possibly 5 if we can progress, i'll get a total of 80 or 100 tokens, i will (or will not) be able to go buy that one item from a vendor after the raid is over&quot;. Awfull and not thought-trough.<br />

<br />
I dont care more about loot than about the fun in it; one of my credo's is &quot;gear up to kill things, dont kill things to gear up&quot;. However - it's only common decency to give priority on loot to people who are currently filling that roll. On any in-server pug those are the rules applied. Problem is that with cross-server groups, this common decency disappears. And if all plate-wearers get an equal chance at getting tank or healer loot, no matter if they're tanking, healing, or dpsing, there's really no reason to queue as tank or healer. If the current LFG system queue for dpsers is half an hour, how long do you reckon it will be for LFR? If you're fine with queueing for 2hrs every time you'd like to do a raid, ok then, if not i suggest you hop on the &quot;give priority to the roll currently filling&quot;-wagon.</div></div><hr />

I don't have dps gear cause I don't care for Retribution..actually I hate retribution :P. But I still believe in my opinion even if I don't use it...but what I wanna say is that people will join with the specc they like most and know most and I know many tanks and healers that would join as tank/healers because they like it. Also think about that a dps that may aquire tank gear as off - spec, then maybe someday start joining groups as tank..<br />
That's not how it works in raiding guilds, not when they're raiding current tier. One person is the &quot;main tank&quot;, who is always tank for every fight. One person is &quot;offtank&quot;, tanking for 2tank fights, dpsing for 1tank fights.I know m8 but this is not a guild run is LFR run. Many people don't join guilds because they cannot dedicate in a certain role or in a certain class and want to change every now and then between roles and classes when they get bored (I was like this in wotlk, now I feel dedicated to my protection paladin and don't feel the need to change role or class). These people will use the LFR..<br />
It's only common decency to give priority on loot to people that are currently filling that role. That's a common decency rule applied to any normal pug that is formed on any server. That's how the general player-base feel it should be.and thats why you see a guy searching for hours a tank or healer...and also there are lot of people who don't need for off-spec not because they feel is not right but because they don't want to get insulted or blamed by people who feel is not right.<br />

Many people don't join guilds because they cannot dedicate in a certain role or in a certain class and want to change every now and then between roles and classes when they get bored (I was like this in wotlk,<br />
<br />
I am one of these so called &quot;casuals&quot; and thats not what the situation is at all. I don't have time to commit to 3-4 raids a week. I have probably 1 night a week where I can commit 3-4 houts in one go and the rest of the time, I have to make do with an hour here or there. I take pride in my spec and I am gemmed right, etc. The problem is time, not some wishy washy spec switching. A lot of people don't have the time to commit. We have a life outside of WOW. Wives, kids, etc. I will be damned if I am going to waste the 1 night a week that I can raid just to have some dips..t ninja something that they probably won't even use and then leave the raid straight afterwards. Need before Greed is broken for this type of thing. It's not the end of the world in a dungeon where you can immediately queue again but we are talking about a situation where you won't be able to get loot from the same boss for a whole week. RNG and roles are bad enough with someone in greens joining a raid by using the PVP gear for the ilvl and then getting lucky on the roll.</div></div><hr />

People with pvp gear gets in instantly and rip the rest of the pve players off left and right. A dps can put higher-level healing gear on to Q just to get in. Tell me, why should I use LFD? Yes there is but one reason: use people that I don't know/care and abuse the system to gear up my fresh 85 alt. Winner!!!</div></div><hr />

This is THE basic excuse everyone is using. I play at a guild that consist of mainly old progress raiders, that all finished their school/university/whatever and now have jobs. Therefore we are able to only raid once a week on Sundays. We normally raid for abour 4 hours that day and are in heroics at the moment. <br />
<br />
What I want to say is, that progressing through the normal content has nothing to do with huge time efforts, but basically with being able to play his class and to react properly. So bad players (not casual but BAD) will still struggle even in the newly introduced retard mode, since standing in the fire will hurt there aswell and having the +hit/agi gemmed priest will still not help exactly to overcome the encounters.<br />
<br />
TL;DR: Playing properly will get you through every normal mode with very littly time needed, so stop using the excuse &quot;I want to see the content, but can not raid 4 times a week&quot;....bad players will still wipe in retard mode</div></div><hr />

Please tell me a guild that I can join that is happy to raid once a week? I know what do to and research fights before hand but cannot raid more than once a week. I battle to even get pugs because all pugs require 7/7. The point is that LFR will help if it is done right but it should not be a place for &quot;bad&quot; players to get geared or for people to ninja stuff for the OS. That will ruin the experience for everyone. Let us get loot from the same boss once per day and you can leave the loot rules are they presently are. Once a week and they need to be fixed.</div></div><hr />

So your guild requires you to have 4 uninterrupted hours of playtime every sunday? That's not really casual. Most people like me, and most people I know, simply do not have scheduled play time, and sure as hell not the same time of the week every week. One week they might have a few uninterrupted hours of playtime on sunday, the next week they won't have any time to play, the week after maybe a few hours on wednesday evening. <br />
<br />
So, which guild exactly would cater to such persons (like myself)? Yeah, none. Because if you have a busy life, you can't really tell if you got a few hours to raid until pretty much half an hour before. The Raid Finder sounds freaking AWESOME to me.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheBoo</div><div class="date">2011-09-30, 02:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I don't see the point in you guys complaining over the loot rules. This is not the donguen finder it's for raid same as all the other raids. These rules are same as if you were in normal raid with your guild or your server pug, if you didn't get loot off a 1st boss in your guild run don't you have to wait whole week to kill the same boss for your turn At loot on the same boss? So it's the same thing that applies here wait another week for it to reset.<br />
But normal raids have DKP/EPGP/Consul Loot systems that organize loot distribution among raiders, so if you dont get loot on 1st week - you'll be in higher priority on next one and so on. <br />
In case with LFR - your chances are same every week and everyone will hit &quot;NEED&quot; for both main of off specs just because they can (any loot is better that no loot) making it even worse.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Puntar</div><div class="date">2011-09-30, 02:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Reasons why this is going to get hard to stand <br />
<br />
1&gt; PvP Gear: When you zone in, and you find out that half of the dps and half of the healers are on PvP gear, shit will happen. Healers going OOM mid combat, dps doing 10k, etc etc. <br />
<br />
2&gt; Finding a Raid Leader with patience: It just seems really odd for me that someone will want to go thru the whole problem of explaining fights, assigning roles, calling out directions and correcting mistakes if they dont win absolutely nothing extra. Finding good raid leaders is going to be incredible hard, and the average raid leader will be your normal guy in blues, trying crazy strats and raging about no one paying him attention. <br />
<br />
3&gt; Ninjaing: This will be THE issue, people rolling on MS, OS and even the third spec they dont own will be really common. Warriors rolling on agi mail, tanks needing on 2handers. This happens every day on the LFD tool, and it will happen on the LFR tool. <br />
<br />
4&gt; The Average Pug: Really bad players will get in the system, players that stand in fire, players that dont listen to advices, players that wear the wrong kind of armor, that gems old vanilla gems, and doenst enchant their gear. Douches pulling to wipe the raid, people breaking CCs earlier, etc etc. All this will be bread of every day in the LFR tool. <br />
<br />
5&gt; Managing a 25man raid without vent: People going AFK mid fight or before a pull, people disconnecting, some people pcs wont be able to handle 25mans correctly, so they will lag a lot. Not being able to actively communicate orders thru voice, will make things incredibly hard, because how will you tell your raidmates that X guy has to get out of fire, if that guy just doesnt read the chat? <br />
<br />
So.. i foresee 2 scenarios happening <br />
<br />
1. Blizz will make the current raid in LFR incredibly easy to absurd levels (not dying and feeling godlike even standing in fire). So free gear for everyone and 0 learning at all.<br />
2. Blizz will make the current raid in LFR hard (not hard like normal or hardmode, but you get it), and only 1 raid every blue moon will be able to clear the whole raid without disbanding. <br />
<br />
Hopefully blizz can sort this somehow!<br />
<br />
I forsee the rise of using in-game built voice system however crappy it might be. If player won't comply that s/he has at least speakers/headset turned on, s/he will be kicked out of the raid.</div></div><hr />
