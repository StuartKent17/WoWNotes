Raegwyn - 1 Death Knight vs. 2 Cataclysm Heroic Bosses<br />
Raegwyn was looking for a new way to spend time and decided it would be fun to try to solo an heroic boss, it probably wasn't hard enough because he eventually decided to solo two of them at the same time. <br />

Nerfnow (http://www.nerfnow.com/comic/499) has an interesting point of view on tanks and healers ...<br />

I know your pain...<br />
<br />
Raegwyn is the reason I am leveling my dk now, and rolling him blood.<br />
<br />
Also, I think the big reason he is able to solo like that, is that you still get the blood shield while using the glyph of dark succor. This allows for some insane self healing regardless of damage.</div></div><hr />

So, past 4.1 you will probably see no new solo videos since selfheal will receive a big drop. Right now blood mastery combined with unholy presence and death strike glyph is the reason why Raegwyn was getting so many solo kills.</div></div><hr />

* We are nerfing Raegwyn. Yes, just the character.<br />
<br />
Well kind of. They are nerfing the mechanic he is using. If you notice he's in Unholy Presence while Blood specced using the Death Strike glyph I'm presuming. Come next patch it will be interesting to see if he can do it again since he won't be able to obtain the Blood Shield buff while in a different presence than Blood. For the moment it is a nice feat, but will be interesting to see if he can pull it off again next patch.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I dunno, us mages aren't very good at DPSing whilst running :p I'd be worn out if I had to run the length an entire instance 3 times just to get the kill.<br />
<br />
But anyway, god damn that DK. If he manages to solo a Heroic Raid boss before the next expansion, then I think Blizzard really need to make Raegwyn the end-game boss in the next one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Skeletons for models is difficult to code more so than make. You have to get the movements right, so that when you/it is walked, your leg doesnt randomly jump to your skull. Overall, I would rate your question a 4, because in the gaming world, its more of a time restraint to get it right. But this is my oppinion, and other are entitled to their own.</div></div><hr />

These two bosses are nothing more than chumps. They don't hit hard unless you do something stupid.<br />
Hell most boss fights work better if the 2 of the DPS die, that way the healer can take care of himself the tank and the 1 dps who knows how to not die to shit on the ground.<br />
<br />
Both fight mechanics are based entirely around situational awareness - if you run out of the ground slam and shatter, you will take very little damage as a tank on Ozruk. As for slabhide, his melee damage isn't very impressive, it's the fire on the ground and the falling rocks that do damage. If you move out of the way of their prime abilities, you hardly take any damage whatsoever. <br />
<br />
I'm not saying it wasn't neat, but it's not exactly the most complicated thing in the world. I've tanked these several times where everybody except for me and a dps lived and we managed to get the fight finished. Pally and DK tanks have enough self healing that unless there is a &quot;one shot&quot; ability like ground slam (removed in 4.1 you can stand in it and live, how retarded) or a unstoppable bleed, the boss will just slowly die unless there is a hard enrage timer.</div></div><hr />

Every of these solo videos have a spot on the first page and apparently more than you think &quot;cares&quot;.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't manage to solo these on my DK, it would require too much time and possibly reactions.</div></div><hr />

Actually he's getting nerfed. No more Blood Shield while in Frost/Unholy presence. This means he either gets 15% health death strikes, or much lower death strikes but with blood shield.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shaemus</div><div class="date">2011-04-17, 08:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Why would you be impressed if he solos a boss that hits really hard? Well then the game would be broken. The whole idea behind soloing bosses are to pick such where you with CLEVER playing and quick thinking can avoid enough damage to survive. Every of these solo videos have a spot on the first page and apparently more than you think &quot;cares&quot;.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't manage to solo these on my DK, it would require too much time and possibly reactions.<br />
<br />
Yes, the videos are cool and end up on the first page, but this one is just not something I'm really excited about. The other solo's are unique b/c they are bosses that were either 1) super hard to deal with at lower level b/c of stupid instagib abilities and whatnot or 2) impressive lore bosses with long fight mechanics (lk10). The fun is seeing people defeat some of the older mechanics by outgearing the situation or using cooldowns in an impressive manner. Watching a rogue solo twin emperors, this dk's video of lk10, etc, those are impressive. But kiting a boss up a hallway who's only ability to damage you involves you being a moron and standing in his killshot zone, only to run into a boss who can't really kill you unless you stand in the fire.... it's just not that impressive. I've seen these bosses go down to a single tank before in heroics, it's cool that he kited them together, but they aren't bosses that are gear checks for tanks, they are situational awareness fights for the DPS and healers, the tank really doesn't have to do all that much. It's like watching a pally tank solo the 1st boss in the newest Blackrock heroic, it's cool but it's not exactly groundbreaking.</div></div><hr />

As said, before you start thinking &quot;OP DK&quot; or &quot;faceroll bosses&quot; keep in mind not any DK can do this... for Raegwyn to do this probably took a LOT of wipes and tries to get the correct positioning as well as the right procs and abilities to use at what time.<br />
<br />

Hell most boss fights work better if the 2 of the DPS die, that way the healer can take care of himself the tank and the 1 dps who knows how to not die to shit on the ground.<br />
<br />
Both fight mechanics are based entirely around situational awareness - if you run out of the ground slam and shatter, you will take very little damage as a tank on Ozruk. As for slabhide, his melee damage isn't very impressive, it's the fire on the ground and the falling rocks that do damage. If you move out of the way of their prime abilities, you hardly take any damage whatsoever. <br />

I'm not saying it wasn't neat, but it's not exactly the most complicated thing in the world. I've tanked these several times where everybody except for me and a dps lived and we managed to get the fight finished. Pally and DK tanks have enough self healing that unless there is a &quot;one shot&quot; ability like ground slam (removed in 4.1 you can stand in it and live, how retarded) or a unstoppable bleed, the boss will just slowly die unless there is a hard enrage timer.<br />

It's still very impressive given its a current 5 man heroic. I'd be interested in seeing his gear type (tanking vs dps gear). I didn't pay attention to how many times he dodged. Judging on his health though (188k), I'd say he has to be in the 359-372 range, probably closer to the latter.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, he did pick bosses where the mechanics can be bypassed with half a brain, but to say this is unimpressive is laughable.<br />
<br />
1) He is soloing 2 bosses at the same time, not just 1 boss.<br />
2) He is soling current cataclysm bosses while we're still in freaking 4.0.x. If this was 4.3+ with legendary weapons, it would be a different matter. but still in 4.0!?!<br />
3) I can only imagine this took a lot of time and effort and many, many wipes.<br />
4) I couldn't do this, is way too much hassle :D<br />
<br />
Just blindly criticising the hard work that others do, while you just sit there and watch is pretty moronic. if its so unimpressive, feel free to do it yourself and post your video.</div></div><hr />

Hunters have also the possibility to solo them, but i think its doable only alone, because controlling tanking pet, making damage from main char and tanking two bosses at the time can be impossible...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, he did pick bosses where the mechanics can be bypassed with half a brain, but to say this is unimpressive is laughable.<br />
<br />
1) He is soloing 2 bosses at the same time, not just 1 boss.<br />
2) He is soling current cataclysm bosses while we're still in freaking 4.0.x. If this was 4.3+ with legendary weapons, it would be a different matter. but still in 4.0!?!<br />
3) I can only imagine this took a lot of time and effort and many, many wipes.<br />
4) I couldn't do this, is way too much hassle :D<br />
<br />
Just blindly criticising the hard work that others do, while you just sit there and watch is pretty moronic. if its so unimpressive, feel free to do it yourself and post your video.<br />
<br />
How is it blindly criticizing? There are 2 heroic bosses back to back that cannot kill a geared tank with their damage. They solely rely on shit on the ground to do it for them. Slabhide doesn't even attack anyone during 50% of the encounter b/c he is in the air. Like others have posted, spriests have had to tank slabhide, lots of people have solo'd these bosses when people have fallen over dead from not moving in time. These bosses are specifically designed to teach you not to stand in stuff and that is why they are being nerf'd because people are still too stupid.<br />
<br />
I'm not criticizing the video, I think it's cool, all I said was it was the least impressive video he's posted. Everybody else likes to read into comments, I never said it wasn't good work. It's not an easy task, I admit that, all I ever said was that it's kinda unimpressive b/c dozens of groups have had to watch their tanks solo these bosses, it's neat to see them both go down at once, just literally picking 2 bosses that cannot kill you due to current glyphs and specs doesn't instantly make me fall to my knees and grovel. Read into what you want....</div></div><hr />

<br />
No you see....thats the problem. You're calling it a skin. A skin is a texture. Its like wallpaper but for 3D models. If that was a reskin it'd still have the wings of the original doomguard model. Its a new model with a reused skeleton. Making a new skeleton is painful work. Its like making a claymation model and sticking a wire skeleton inside. Then you have to mark the places where the skeleton can bend, and how far it can bend, then you have to make the animations and my gawd does that suck. Its the worst part ever. Ever made a Flash animation and know about keyframes? Its basically like that, but they have to animate it and make it look nice and realistic rather than a crappy 2d flash animation. Then they have to do that like 20 times for every emote. And finally after like a 1 or 2 weeks they've finally finished a single new model/skeleton/animations/sound effects. ONE enemy wasted a week plus. Ooor they can just create a model. Honestly sculpting the model is enough work as it is and its perfectly fine that they don't make new skeletons every time.<br />

<br />
I disagree I'm quite sure I could do that and in no way do I feel that makes me amazing. The fail here is that in all these solo videos there has been raid buffs/buffs from other classes which completely ruins the entire aspect of going &quot;solo&quot; against a boss. Any DK that is somewhat intelligent can solo the majority of these bosses. I can't think of any heroic boss that would be terribly hard to solo and those two together is much more like 1.5 bosses instead of 2. Impressive to me would be the guy at the end of BRC and Steelbender together. That I'd give a good clap for.<br />
<br />
Last but not least Blood Shields while in Unholy pres. These solos are going to be a lot harder post 4.1 I'd like to see them reattempted after the patch.</div></div><hr />

About Daily Blink, I have seem lots of tanks like that, thinking their job is pull, and just that. Healer have to make him immortal, and Damage Dealers have to make enemies dead. But Healers are few that don't have any idea of their work. Depressing is the fact that most DPS think that way. It's less responsibility. No, it's not.</div></div><hr />

They have been pretty creative at times with how they use their existing skeletons but were getting ot the point where things are starting to look very same-y.<br />
<br />
Look at Wrath (not including Naxx): 6 player character, 5 dragons, 13 giants, 1 lich, 1 dreadlord, 1 Vrykul, 1 Faceless, 1 proto, 1 Val'kyr, 1 Nerubian, 1 Mutant-Troll, NRB<br />
<br />
Marrowgar, XT, Kolo, Yogg, and the peices of mimiron were the only fully new models built for raids in the entire expansion. Thats 5/38(13%), or roughly 1 boss per raid. That's not good.<br />
<br />
Now 6 of those 'species' listed above were introduced in wrath; even counting them only brings it up to 10/38, or 25%. Its obviously unreasonable to expect the 10ish bosses in an average raid tier to all be brand new, but I don't think expecting 40-50% of a tiers bosses to be new is unreasonable. <br />
<br />
I'm even fine with designing some models that you'll use multiple times in the same instance. Similarity can sometimes help provide theme, i think the heavy use of giants in Ulduar worked well. Its yet another one of the myriad reasons why Ulduar outshone the rest of the expansion by a mile. Of Ulduar's 14 Bosses, 6 were giants, 3 were wrath mobs we'd never seen in a raid before, and 5 were entirely new. That right there is the recipe for success.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because it is too much to ask you to avoid standing next to a Death Knight feeding him Death Strikes or allowing Warriors to kill your team mates so they can use Victory Rush in the first place... try kiting/disarming/using evasion against a Death Knight, it can be difficult, but if you're going to just stand there and feed them heals, don't complain about it, I'd be a very upset person if my Death Knight could no longer tank because of bad PvP nerds.</div></div><hr />

Honestly, it will not be that much harder in 4.1 Both of these bosses are idiot checks.. Good tanks normally take very little damage unless they do something wrong in both encounters. My guess, if he had made one mistake now, he would have died.. after 4.1 if he makes one mistake he will die. if he does it flawlessly like he did now, he will be able to do it after the nerfs.<br />
<br />
If you are a good tank on either of these two bosses, next run tell your healer to just dps and you focus on self healing.. You will be amazed at how easy they are without a healer if you don´t make any mistakes. It is really really impressive that he did them together though.</div></div><hr />

I don't care about PVP. I'm a PVE healer and I'm really disappointed to see tanks healing themselves whenever they lose 50% hp.<br />
Cataclysm is boring and frustrating for the healers, I can no longer demonstrate how good I am when tanks get low hp, my role is diminished, you can't understand how bad these healing abilities are turning our gameplay.<br />

...and beside tanking is about keep threat, damage mitigation, armor value. Your way to be a good tank should not include self-healing, well, indeed a tank who don't need healers is a better tank.<br />
Actually tanks are better than before, they would be very upset people if their tank could no longer be imba (I trust you, I would see the healers and dps steal your tank role and then ask you to don't complain), as they don't need healers. <br />

Actually tanks are better than before, they would be very upset people if their tank could no longer be imba (I trust you, I would see the healers and dps steal your tank role and then ask you to don't complain), as they don't need healers. <br />
We idiots who rolled an healer shouldn't complain for our lost entertainment.<br />
<br />
<br />
DK's can't block. They aren't about mitigating damage. Their self-healing IS their version of block. Stop being so stupid and actually learn how a class works before you complain about it. It makes you look much less retarded and will save you tons of embarrassment.<br />
<br />
DK's are on par with other tanks for raid content. They arent above. They are the same. You being a healer should understand this, but apparently you aren't as good as you think yourself to be. <br />
<br />
So again...<br />
<br />
Stop being an idiot.</div></div><hr />

No you see....thats the problem. You're calling it a skin. A skin is a texture. Its like wallpaper but for 3D models. If that was a reskin it'd still have the wings of the original doomguard model. Its a new model with a reused skeleton. Making a new skeleton is painful work. Its like making a claymation model and sticking a wire skeleton inside. Then you have to mark the places where the skeleton can bend, and how far it can bend, then you have to make the animations and my gawd does that suck. Its the worst part ever. Ever made a Flash animation and know about keyframes? Its basically like that, but they have to animate it and make it look nice and realistic rather than a crappy 2d flash animation. Then they have to do that like 20 times for every emote. And finally after like a 1 or 2 weeks they've finally finished a single new model/skeleton/animations/sound effects. ONE enemy wasted a week plus. Ooor they can just create a model. Honestly sculpting the model is enough work as it is and its perfectly fine that they don't make new skeletons every time.<br />
<br />
On another note. The difference between a reskin and a remodel.<br />
<br />
Wolf Model:<br />
http://www.wow-petopia.com/images/skin_thumbs/wolfskintimbert.jpg<br />
<br />
This a basic wolf model. And this below is a RESKIN...<br />
<br />
http://www.wow-petopia.com/images/skin_thumbs/wolfskincoyotet.jpg<br />
<br />
To make a new skin they merely have to change the tint of the current texture. Easy stuff.<br />
<br />
A entirely new and different model with the same skeleton (which every one keeps calling a &quot;reskin&quot;) would be a fox:<br />
<br />
http://www.wow-petopia.com/images/skin_thumbs/mistfoxskinredt.jpg<br />
<br />
It has the same skeleton as a wolf, but they had to sculpt the model AND make an entirely new skin from scratch. This right here is NOT a reskin. A reskin would be one of the two wolf examples. Same model with a slightly altered skin.</div></div><hr />

The fail here is that in all these solo videos there has been raid buffs/buffs from other classes which completely ruins the entire aspect of going &quot;solo&quot; against a boss. Any DK that is somewhat intelligent can solo the majority of these bosses. I can't think of any heroic boss that would be terribly hard to solo and those two together is much more like 1.5 bosses instead of 2. Impressive to me would be the guy at the end of BRC and Steelbender together. That I'd give a good clap for.<br />
<br />
Last but not least Blood Shields while in Unholy pres. These solos are going to be a lot harder post 4.1 I'd like to see them reattempted after the patch.<br />
<br />
guessing this is you, http://us.battle.net/wow/en/character/bleeding-hollow/sobegreen/simple<br />

No matter how skilled a player of another class is they can not do this... This shouldn't be possible by a player with ANY amount of skill.

Because every model has to be completely new and can't share animations or skeleton of other models? <br />
<br />
If you're going to snipe over something I'm pretty sure anyone would do to cut down the cost of making an entire model from scratch or cut down the time, then why don't you go snipe at animation companies who do the exact same thing pretty much?<br />

Ozruk and Slabhide? More challenging. Though Slabhide is one of the easiest bosses around.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Deployed</div><div class="date">2011-04-18, 06:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Either way they need to start coming out with damn unique skeletons when they make end game raid bosses. Illidan with Dreadlord animations was retarded. Thank god they got it through their skulls for Lich King but its too bad they'll be using the same skeleton for Deathwing they've been using for dragons for the past 7 years.<br />
<br />
If you want to wait a couple of months for a new mob, then sure, why not?<br />
<br />
You may notice that the only time this game has EVER seen new skeleton's is when there is an expansion (because they have 1-2 years to work on it) and the final content patch (because it is preplanned and the animators are given their goals loooong before it's intended release, i.e. they are potentially working on 4.4 animations right now.)<br />
<br />
Creating mobs from scratch is a lot of work. The Skeleton is the most problimatic, but cannot be done first.<br />
<br />
They start with concept art, just like all video game visuals do.<br />
They then make the model (without skin and in the &quot;crucifix&quot; placeholder skeleton typically).<br />
They then begin work on the skeleton (often performed by different departments. Animators have to wait for the model (structure/shape) to be completed.)<br />
Skins can be produced at this time, but when producing from scratch, it is unwise to do so.<br />
Once they're mostly happy with the skeleton, they'll go back to the model and fix any really bad visual glitches. Morphing polygons, apendages that clip the body because they too long etc<br />
If done perfect first time (unlikely) it's then properly skinned. You have to wait until this point to apply the skin because the model geometry is constantly changing during the model and skeleton development stages.<br />
On a problem free run, ignorning time for concept art, you're looking at a significant amout of time. This is all cut down by using an existing skeleton because there is less going back and forth between the model and animation departments constantly making tweeks to get it right.<br />
Not to mention that you're taking the animators away from future tasks which, not only delays the next patch because we have to wait for these new skeletons you want, but delays future patches because you took them away from the work they're doing.<br />
<br />
Before you say &quot;hire more animators&quot;, there is a limit to how much they need to do. Hire too many and suddenly they're there twiddling their thumbs getting paid to do nothing until they are made redundant. Which is poor project management. NEVER over hire. Small companies can't afford it and large companies can't risk bad profiling and the lose of very experienced and skilled personel.<br />
<br />
<br />
Illidan was not given &quot;proper&quot; treatment because he was a mid-way boss. KJ did get a unique skeleton, Kel'Thuzad didn't, but Vanilla's raid schedule wasn't properly planned out as the following expansions. Rotface and Festergut were originally designed looooong before the release of Wrath, let alone 3.3<br />
<br />
BTW, when Blizzard added wings to the BE model to make the Blood Queen, people didn't run around shouting &quot;reskin reskin&quot;, they said &quot;wow, those wings look cool&quot;. FYI, adding to an existing model can be as easy as taking elements away due to texture geometry.</div></div><hr />

The comic is only partially true though. Most new people don't have the brainpower to make a logical and thought out decision because that would take knowledge and experience (and lets face it, their new!). The later part of most healers and tanks being bumbling idiots who &quot;I'm amazed mobs aren't re-spawning at our pace&quot;, is fairly accurate.</div></div><hr />

I just don't understand why this gets you (and others) so bent out of shape. Maybe people aren't 100% correct, but I'm sure you and everyone else understands what they mean. I don't expect people to fully understand the vernacular of my profession, but when they've got the right idea and I can understand what they mean I don't fly off the handle and get in their face over it. People calling for bans because people are calling it a &quot;reskin&quot; is a little much.</div></div><hr />

Both of these encounters are about environmental awareness and movement = avoiding the bad. They are not about direct tank damage. What makes them 'hard' is the terrible 3-4k DPS, who can't move and stand in the bad and burn healers mana, often leading to wipe.</div></div><hr />

I said many times that Death Strike needs to be removed as Victory Rush for warriors, healers have to heals no one else. Actually these classes abuse of those healing abilities. As priests I have no heal that can replenish 100k hps instantly (nor overtime).<br />
They get away the healers fun when they lose 30% hp healing themselves, but still Blizzard fixes are clueless, they are buffing Death Strike instead!<br />
<br />
They also can't replenish 100k instantly without a large CD. DS can't do that in a single hit and a DK also need to actually HIT the mob to use it, so they lost some of the mitigation/avoidance to put hit on their gear, while other tanks skip it.<br />
<br />
Nice huh?<br />
<br />
The same way we see cloth users tanking a boss when that should be a tank job.<br />

I don't care about PVP. I'm a PVE healer and I'm really disappointed to see tanks healing themselves whenever they lose 50% hp.<br />
Cataclysm is boring and frustrating for the healers, I can no longer demonstrate how good I am when tanks get low hp, my role is diminished, you can't understand how bad these healing abilities are turning our gameplay.<br />
<br />
...and beside tanking is about keep threat, damage mitigation, armor value. Your way to be a good tank should not include self-healing, well, indeed a tank who don't need healers is a better tank.<br />
Actually tanks are better than before, they would be very upset people if their tank could no longer be imba (I trust you, I would see the healers and dps steal your tank role and then ask you to don't complain), as they don't need healers. <br />
We idiots who rolled an healer shouldn't complain for our lost entertainment.<br />
<br />
So we need to go crazy when a healer heal someone else other than tanks? &quot;It's sad when we see a healer healing others in raid instead of just one target&quot;.<br />
<br />
That's why a healer take care of 4 others in a 5man, and more ppl in raids. Would be really boring if all you had to do was to heal a single guy the entire game, right? Or no? Bragging rights saying &quot;I'm the best damn heal spammer in the world!&quot;. LOL<br />
<br />
I see healers showing so much skill in raids, things way better than spamming a guy that can avoid/mitigate most of the damage that is not supposed to one-shot him every 0.5sec the entire raid night...<br />
<br />
The game has evolved from &quot;/focus 'tank' /spamheal&quot;...<br />

To people whining about the mobs, please, sthu. It's not exactly easy to just come out with a completely new skeleton for every single trash mob in the game.

Heh, he's in UH stance which means he wouldn't be too good on holding the aggro.<br />
<br />
Anyway, he should probably try and put out as many kills as possible before 4.1 comes out and essentially kills his method of soloing. Blood DKs will no longer get a blood shield when using DS out of blood presence in 4.1 making that glyph pretty useless.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sorry, wrong. Plain and simple.<br />
<br />
There are three key features to a 3D entity in the game.<br />
<br />
Skeleton (animation, posture)<br />
Model (shape, structure)<br />
Texture (skin, effects)<br />
<br />
This model has the same posture, that posture can appear on any model that it is applied to.<br />
The BASE model is the same base model as the Doomguard. More than likely that the Doomguard model is the default template assigned to that skeleton.<br />
They take the base model and adjust it to be something new. Notice that the head is not the same shape. Apply the doomguard texture to this model and it will be destorted to a horrendous degree.<br />
Additionally, the lost of wings may seem insignificant to you, but it means alterations to the texture geometry.<br />
<br />
This was not a 5 minute job. Nor was it the several month project that was Kil'jaeden. This is appropriate.<br />
<br />
Like I and many others have pointed out, it's time consuming to make new mobs. You want a dozen new mobs (from scratch every time) every patch, then you can wait 18+ months for each patch then, be my guest. I'm not a petulant child that throws a tantrum over how long the content patch cycle takes, and I'm sure your post history wont show any similar complaints from you.<br />
<br />
Boub, to discourage this constant BS, is it possible to show these models without their planned skeletons assigned to them. Could you use a rigid posture that they more than likely used during the design process instead?</div></div><hr />

In terms of raid tanking (the environment where most of their dev time is spent) they really don't come out ahead of the other tanking classes (cept bears). If they didn't self heal so much, they'd be paper weights against a raid boss, their lack of a shield really hurts them, so they self heal to make up for the reduced dmg mitigation. When you significantly out-gear content, self healing&gt;dmg mitigation...but blizz doesn't really balance a class around whether or not they can solo content that they significantly out gear. Ever tried healing a dk that's just starting heroic dungeons? It's a bitch.

Not sure if serious.<br />
<br />
<br />
A hero class is a character class derived from the base classes, but with exclusive perks. Examples of these perks include a higher starting level, better starting gear, unique abilities, and class mounts. Another example of a perk is that your abilities can run off something other than mana, rage or energy.<br />
<br />
For obvious reasons, its not supposed to be OP. Although the class mechanics enable DKs to do stuff that other classes couldnt, such thing happens to hunters and paladins too, among others.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
The point most people miss is, we don't know how many times he tried to get this to work. We only see the end film, the one he wants to show. Its not like you cannot memorize a boss script, dbm tells you what to do and when to do it.<br />
<br />
He may have tried 4-5 times, true. He may have used various buffs or addons to help him, true. But you can still memorize it. It's called playing with sounds on and actually rehearsing the fight in your head. For some people its just called using your brain.<br />
<br />
Slabhide - Sand Blast is merely added damage, there's nobody else there so positioning is irrelevant. Eruption should not deal much damage if always on the move, and you will need to be. If the dragon is walking away from you obviously hes going into his air phase, which again is probably not going to be of any consequence with always being on the move. Crystal Storm AoE is the only concern and that is a predictable cast.<br />
<br />
Ozruk - Outside of basic melee damage and his shields this boss's damage is non existent. He yells when hes casting Ground Slam, and with no other players in the group positioning is irrelevant. He yells when performing Shatter, again without others the positioning is not of importance, and if your always on the move to avoid it should be of ease. <br />
<br />
The complication is micro managing avoiding Ground Slam/Shatter and Crystal Storm. It looks like he prioritized taking a few hits from Crystal Storm over Ozruk's abilities. Makes sense as Ozruk would give knock backs and likely put him into a horrible position. Ozruk has an enrage when low on health but that's why he was killed second. There is some luck involved (you see a spot or two where he just avoids death) and its nothing I would wanna try on my DK (I wanna see the gear he uses when he does this stuff) but that's just some of the logic used when preparing yourself. No DBM required.<br />

Blizzard did not make those previews, as you might've inferred from the approximately six hundred copies of the MMO-Champion logo present in every single picture.</div></div><hr />

Good sir, if you expect the denizens of this online community to have the observation skills of a third grader, then you will be perpetually disappointed.</div></div><hr />

So many people like solo'ing instances but still Blizzard don't give any real NEW content for people to use this play style on. Except urm current heroic dungeons.<br />
<br />
Did anyone solo a heroic LK boss this early in the expansion when it came out?</div></div><hr />

-.- raegwyn or w/e gets way WAY the hell too much credit. GG playing an OP class and stealing strats from a french blogger. -.-<br />

Oh and be prepared in 4.1 to be replaced by Beartanks soloing. so once again everyone will be able to complain that druids are better than your class.</div></div><hr />

Or did I miss something?<br />
<br />
I was wondering the same thing. Slabhide is a door boss, so there's no proper way to get to Ozruk without killing Slabhide first. The 3 things I came up with are: 1. using a private server and teleporting past the boss; 2. this was before they hotfixed the guild perk &quot;Have group will travel&quot; and had a rogue or kitty stealth past the boss without triggering it and then use the spell; 3. His group intentionally wipes on Slabhide, but has a hunter Feign Death, the hunter then runs past the bosses room and uses the guild perk &quot;Mass Resurrection&quot;.<br />
<br />
<br />
Isn't Slabhide skippable?<br />
<br />
I don't think you can actually skip Slabhide. He stands in the middle of the room and has a pretty far aggro range.</div></div><hr />

Actually, there is sometimes i bug where it takes quite a while before he lands and another that makes him reset (though i don't know how to reproduce it, it happened to me twice)</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lthompson94</div><div class="date">2011-04-22, 01:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Skeletons for models is difficult to code more so than make. You have to get the movements right, so that when you/it is walked, your leg doesnt randomly jump to your skull. Overall, I would rate your question a 4, because in the gaming world, its more of a time restraint to get it right. But this is my oppinion, and other are entitled to their own.<br />
<br />
First off, you don't &quot;code&quot; skeletons, well you could code a &quot;rig&quot; I guess. You use graphical interfaces, modifiers, and constraints (kinematic, inverse kinematic) on a series of &quot;bones&quot; and apply different physics to the joint types. Then, the bones are &quot;rigged&quot; to animate basically like a marionette, and where any coding and modifiers come in. That's the hard part - rigging. Making a skeleton is about a 2 in difficultly. Making it rigged and ready to animate - 10+. The animation itself is relatively straightforward. Any jackass can do it, but not do it well. To get it right that's another 8+.<br />
<br />
Now, a &quot;model&quot; can also be referred to as a &quot;skin&quot; in the 3-d modeling industry, but it doesn't apply to what people are talking about in video games. Basically, binding a model to an existing skeleton (rig) is called &quot;skinning&quot; in a 3d-modeling perspective - this is why there's so much confusion. The skin is a live component that has to be weight adjusted to be reactive to the movements of the skeleton (rig). This is a modifier that is generally placed on the model itself, &quot;converting&quot; it to a pliable &quot;skin.&quot; It's a step between model and rigged model - you can't SEE the skin, its an effect on the model which makes it move correctly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Skin&quot; for all intents and purposes in video game is actually what's referred to in modeling as an alpha map or &quot;texture.&quot; This is the actual paintjob. There's tons of texture type all of which are layed over the model like a &quot;skin,&quot; hence why gamers refer to the texture job as a &quot;skin.&quot; Textures (maps) can create opacity fields, bump maps, specularity, deformation and so on.<br />
<br />
So &quot;skin&quot; is half-way right when people refer to it as the model itself - that's a weak half. The model has to be skinned to be reactive to the rig. However, people need to realize that in the gaming community (which is far removed from the 3d-modeling/animating industry) skin=texture.<br />
<br />
So gamers:<br />
<br />
Skin = paintjob (texture)<br />
Model = physical geometry of the object<br />
Rig = moveable &quot;skeleton&quot;<br />
<br />
That's the best I can do. And yes, I'm a 3d-modeller/texture artist/animator in Maya and Max. And yes, it's for money.</div></div><hr />
