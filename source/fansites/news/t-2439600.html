Yep. That's just beyond fucking stupid.<br />

There is nothing valuable or fun about being pissed that I'm unable to play another spec without having to make big changes. Such as farming Azerite pieces.<br />

<br />
I feel like there are a lot of minor issues with the fundamental concept of the system, the core mechanics of how it works, that can't easily be fixed without completely reworking the system. These issues aren't major ones individually, but combined, really bog it down.<br />
<br />
Even making the traits exciting and competitive and easier to target isn't going to fix how clunky the system itself actually is, so it's never going to feel as great as it could unless they change it fundamentally.</div></div><hr />

He does. It just seems he believes they are right when players have presented fair criticism on this system.<br />

Annoys me to no end when devs act as if the criticism means nothing.<br />

<br />
STOP TELLING ME WHAT MATTERS TO ME FFS.<br />
<br />
Honestly, perfect itemization matters less to the world first race, they are pushing with whatever gear they happen to get. RNG is mitigated by split runs a bit, but they don't have time to farm perfect gear if they want to complete the mythic raid in the first/second week.<br />
<br />
Perfect itemization is a giant crutch for slower progressing guilds, not the top guilds.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, it would have been a proper thing for them to implement based on all the things they did with the artifact system in Legion. Do you need a visual? I can Photoshop my idea but I explained it pretty clearly, you still have the same gear just with one empty slot you cannot use unless you have a Relic to slot in, if you already have the trait you want great, if you don't then you can craft one or try to get one from content and then socket it in and choose it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The Azerite system is confusing and opaque. Most of their spec specific traits should have been a level 120 talent tier with a variety of interesting generic themed traits on the outer ring instead. <br />
<br />
It's an expensive pain to test and determine which traits should be the best for you unless you want to either spend a ton of money reforging your azerite or run sims. Sims which for most of the community are rather confusing. <br />
<br />
Tanks right now are just a crap show, partially because they messed too much with the tuning and GCD change effecting too much and resource costs. But also because they decided to make most dungeons much more intense while removing utility that could make the game less stressful overall but concentrates utility to specific classes which all feels like a further overcorrection from the homogenization of WoD. <br />
<br />
I'm subbed for a while and plan on remaining so, but right now it's because I've finally found some cool folks to play with after a very long time. I'm not currently all that excited for getting a piece of gear to drop outside of the normal &quot;damn, I could really use a higher level weapon.&quot;</div></div><hr />

Extraction points will let you set up an extractor to defend, granting a steady stream of Azerite. You'll need to prevent the other faction from taking it, or recapture it if they do.<br />
<br />
That's just fucking great, so it'll become even harder to get any Rewards/impossible without a premade. Getting Azerite is Not The Problem. I don't get this change, like, at all.</div></div><hr />

Honestly, perfect itemization matters less to the world first race, they are pushing with whatever gear they happen to get. RNG is mitigated by split runs a bit, but they don't have time to farm perfect gear if they want to complete the mythic raid in the first/second week.<br />
<br />
Perfect itemization is a giant crutch for slower progressing guilds, not the top guilds.<br />

They're out of ideas. All the creativity left the team, as far as these systems. They don't even have a name for the raid they're talking about yet.<br />

Ion may have shone as an encounter designer, but he sucks ass as a leader, and his incompetence as a team lead is showing every week. His game is crumbling at the foundations, but he's busy admiring the doorknob he polished so hard. <br />

Not a very good track record if you recall that the first half of Legion was fairly shitty from a design standpoint.<br />

You're correct, but Blizzard has always been about the horde. Look at the alleged BELF racial nerf, which is more powerful now and used to cheese the zul fight.<br />

Riiight, except I'm critical of Ion making stupid statements as well. The &quot;it is just a few percentage&quot; points line was stupid to utter and he did it.

The reveal last year had me, my partner and our guild all going 'er... oh.' It was the first time in the history of wow that few of us were excited for more content. Partly because we didn't care about the horde vs alliance conflict, but also felt it lacked any real hook to get people excited. No new races. No new classes. No legendary weapons or garrisons or whatever. Just random islands and pve only warfronts - oh and alliance races/reskins.<br />
<br />
Almost a year later and listening to that chat all I can think is 'ugh. Wish I hadn't been right'. This is a dud of an expansion. There's some nice lore and the zones are pretty as ever but the core design, class mechanics, azerite grind etc all feel pointless or broken. And RNG. SO MUCH RNG. <br />
<br />
He's not saying things I want to hear at the minute. Stuff like 'we realize there's too much randomization in the game.' They could add back reforging. They could introducie, say, a catch up mechanic on gear drops. You'll be able to use sanguicell to upgrade an item to its limit, effectively allowing you to add warforging and titanforging (or sockets) to a piece of loot. They could allow pvpers to target gear more effectively. They could have weekly chests display 3 items and allow you to pick the one you liked best. <br />
<br />
Alas...no.</div></div><hr />

It is quite simple really. If you are going to quit, then quit. What do you want us as players to do? Throw a farewell party? If Blizz puts out a shit product then people will quit, we all know it. If people want to give constructive criticism then great. But saying &quot;I quit&quot; adds nothing to a discussion, it is why those types of threads aren't even allowed here.

If you are going to quit, then quit. What do you want us as players to do? Throw a farewell party? If Blizz puts out a shit product then people will quit, we all know it. If people want to give constructive criticism then great. But saying &quot;I quit&quot; adds nothing to a discussion, it is why those types of threads aren't even allowed here. They are useless.<br />
<br />
They're not &quot;useless&quot;, except to you. So stop sniveling about them. Stop trying to negate people's opinions and feelings because YOU don't like them. They have every right to express how they feel - and you have every right to disagree, but it stops there. People invest a LOT of time, energy and passion into this game, I know I did for over a decade, before I quit. It's hard for people to just walk away when they're invested in their characters, and their guilds, and their time. <br />
<br />
And fuck &quot;constructive criticism&quot;, that's a bullshit barrier the mods over the on the general forums created to stifle discontent. It's not the player's fucking job to fix every problem in the game. If something sucks, they have the right to say &quot;this sucks&quot;, and not have a solution, they're not paid to do that, the devs are, and &quot;constructive&quot; anything is THEIR fucking job. <br />
<br />
If you don't want to hear about people quitting, go play a game nobody quits.</div></div><hr />

No, you need to read what I said. If people are posting &quot;I quit&quot; and nothing else, then that is not useful and adds nothing to the discussion. Like I said &quot;I quit&quot; threads aren't allowed here because they don't do a fucking thing to help conversations. If people were posting with actual complaints then sure, there are talking points. <br />
<br />
You can say &quot;X thing sucks&quot; all you want, I mean it doesn't fix anything really but sure add your vote to the pile. But an &quot;I quit&quot; helps really nothing.

And clearly does not play the game.<br />
<br />
Not sure if anyone responded yet or not but he certainly does. He raids on a resto shaman and it’s been linked here plenty of times. He mythic raids with a bunch of people from elitist jerks back in the day which he was also a part of.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately just because he plays the game and may even want the same changes we do, he can’t always do that. Plenty of other players to account for that aren’t here. <br />
<br />
However there’s clearly times where he’s stubborn like Legiondaries and Azerite Armor. Repeatedly told time and time again throughout beta that these systems are bad and feel terrible but they went live anyway. I get that there’s a larger pool of players and data once it hits live but if that’s the perspective than just get rid of beta or at least tell people it’s not for testing purposes. Hell legiondaries could’ve been excellent if the reward structure wasn’t horrible, they were definitely fun when we got the good ones but the journey to getting them was pretty bad unless you got em right away and this was said several hundred times before live.</div></div><hr />

Otherwise what is a spec? If I can swap between feral and guardian between fights then I'm no longer a guardian druid I'm a feral druid with alternating toolkits. It goes back to the fantasy of WoW and it's the little things that need to stay. Also, some gold is a very minor price to pay, literally. I think people wanting an easier spec swap are a little bit entitled. Maintaining multiple specs is a privilege that you work for, not a right. I think we should not be jack-of-all-trades. <br />
<br />
As for the whole system, I think people are confusing issues. Traits per se are not bad as a system. Yes they are unbalanced and some suck. But the system of having extra effects on a piece of gear is good. The problem is obtaining them - that it is so irregular and random and difficult. One solution (credit to Taliesin and Evitel) is to make mythic+ drop the same slots but without azerite traits and for trait gear to only drop in raids. Alternatively, and what I prefer, is that mythic+ and raids and whatever else (warfronts? islands?) give a token which you can accumulate to buy the piece you want. You can adjust the acquisition rates to make raiding better for it or however. Problem solved imho. <br />

<br />
Also when it comes to m+ the level 100 talent row is literaly useless,not one of those talents really helps,rarely are there bosses or even trash packs where the entire party takes enough dmg to justify using ascendance,and chain heal isnt much needed either,its almost always tank dmg or spot healing,and having zero things to give a person for mitigation apart from link also feels bad,we are the only healer that cant do that.</div></div><hr />

Feeling like you did everything right but your tank just fell over and died isn't great. Well wish Ion could see my death log from Vectis where I died after using all my stacks of active mitigation, guardian of ancient kings after I ran out of mitigation, then ardent defender, healthstone, self heal on cd, and another charge of active mitigation, and still died. But no worries, from next week I'm gonna be replaced with brewmaster alt of a guildie. My &quot;ultility&quot; comes down to joining as a 3rd tank for Zul so I can bubble / bop off the blood stacks. Except that, I bring nothing. At least DKs usually have some fight where grips are useful (Zek'voz, Zul, Mythrax). Every other tank can just be replaced by another brewmaster. <br />
<br />
But let's keep musing over tank &quot;utility&quot; or how much &quot;skill&quot; you need to manage your active mitigation while brewmaster doesn't need anything of those and survives everything much better. <br />
<br />
Oh, and btw monk also brings physical debuff that is mandatory, and ring of peace that is really strong on several bosses. They also have great mobility, for example transcendence helps a lot to nullify the knockback from fetid devourer. Absolutely ridiculous a class with best survivability has also so much utility. <br />
<br />
Look at guardian druid and see how their population dropped off when their utility was gutted (stampeding roar cooldown increased by removing the talent, rage of the sleeper as an anti-cc ability gone etc.)</div></div><hr />

Use your brain for a second instead of reacting like a mongrel. A dev will never have a neutral POV about the game even if he's playing, he will always see the commercial success of the game before it's fun, Ion is the best proof of that, he's playing the game and still makes crap decisions which are not in phrase with what players want and expect.</div></div><hr />

One solution (credit to Taliesin and Evitel) is to make mythic+ drop the same slots but without azerite traits and for trait gear to only drop in raids. Alternatively, and what I prefer, is that mythic+ and raids and whatever else (warfronts? islands?) give a token which you can accumulate to buy the piece you want. You can adjust the acquisition rates to make raiding better for it or however. Problem solved imho. <br />
<br />
For everyone else complaining can we suggest some fixes please?<br />
<br />
Any system that lets you accrue currency from spammable content will make people feel like they are forced to run that content again and again and again to earn the currency in the fastest way possible. That is not fun or enjoyable. So if you introduced a currency to the game, it would likely have to be in the M+ chest and not a dungeon drop to be a limiter on the amount of repeatable content people would feel forced to play. <br />
<br />
<br />
they're just throwing shit at a wall with azerite gear at this point to see what sticks.<br />
<br />
What a shambles<br />
<br />
Not really. <br />
<br />
What they are basically doing is telling you the inner rings don't really matter. They are basically normalizing the inner rings and then abandoning them as meaningful bits of the game. The outer ring is all that really matters. <br />
<br />
<br />
In a game where you can change specs, such restrictions are bullshit. It's unbelievable that we went in one expansion we went from &quot;Yeah if you want to switch spec your gear is adapting&quot; to &quot;You want to switch specs ? Fuck you and farm another set of Azerite armor or pay gold to change traits&quot;.<br />
<br />
Legion was also the expansion where if you wanted to switch specs they told you to go farm millions of Artifact Power to level up your off spec's weapon. <br />
<br />
<br />
Ion, for the love of all that is holy on Earth, please just STOP judging about what is fun or not for the players. You, along with the rest of the dev team are NOT players, you might (for some of you), play the game, but you don't have the player POV. People want to queue to do Warfronts with their entire guild ? Leave them, who the heck are you to say that it's not fun for them ? What does it change anyway ? Warfronts are not dynamic and there is no impact to literally rolling on them appart the fact that it makes them shorted (what is, to be honest, a liberation, because they suck). Being an asshole like you are now is what has driven the game in this current state in the first place, holy christ I'm so fed up with that prick.<br />
<br />
Pretty sure waiting 15 minutes would be a pretty bad/poor experience. Like how you can't skip all the dialog in old raids. You just si there, doing nothing for minutes at a time. Plus, he said they were contemplating making a raid friendly version of Warfronts, which would be awesome. So calm down, jeez. <br />
<br />
<br />
Players: This sucks, can you change it?<br />
Ion: {ten minute rambling mansplaination about the COMPLETELY OBVIOUS ramifications of implementing obnoxious restrictions}<br />
<br />
WE. DON'T. CARE. Stop treating these Q&amp;As as an excuse to patronize us like we're your two year old son. If you're not going to improve the object of the complaint, then don't waste an eighth of the presentation &quot;addressing&quot; it.<br />
<br />
He was not patronizing or &quot;mansplaning&quot;. He was just stating Blizzard's design goals and design intentions. If you don't want to listen to that, just read the MMO Champion synopsis. <br />
<br />
<br />
Well wish Ion could see my death log from Vectis where I died after using all my stacks of active mitigation, guardian of ancient kings after I ran out of mitigation, then ardent defender, healthstone, self heal on cd, and another charge of active mitigation, and still died. But no worries, from next week I'm gonna be replaced with brewmaster alt of a guildie. My &quot;ultility&quot; comes down to joining as a 3rd tank for Zul so I can bubble / bop off the blood stacks. Except that, I bring nothing. At least DKs usually have some fight where grips are useful (Zek'voz, Zul, Mythrax). Every other tank can just be replaced by another brewmaster. <br />
<br />
But let's keep musing over tank &quot;utility&quot; or how much &quot;skill&quot; you need to manage your active mitigation while brewmaster doesn't need anything of those and survives everything much better. <br />
<br />
Oh, and btw monk also brings physical debuff that is mandatory, and ring of peace that is really strong on several bosses. They also have great mobility, for example transcendence helps a lot to nullify the knockback from fetid devourer. Absolutely ridiculous a class with best survivability has also so much utility. <br />
<br />
Look at guardian druid and see how their population dropped off when their utility was gutted (stampeding roar cooldown increased by removing the talent, rage of the sleeper as an anti-cc ability gone etc.)<br />
<br />
Like, he literally said they will fix the numbers and buff the low end tanks and, potentially, nerf the high end tanks. The stuff about utility is important as it helps clarify where Blizzard would like the tanks to eventually be - each possessing unique strengths and weaknesses.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Dude, why are you talking about the artifacts ? I'm speaking about the set pieces that swapped, be real.<br />
<br />
<br />
Does it matter what you were talking about? The end result is the same.<br />
<br />
Legion = Set Pieces adapted, 1x Artifacts and 2x Legendaries didn't<br />
<br />
BFA = 3x Azerite Pieces don't adapt.<br />
<br />
<br />
The end result is the same, with the huge difference that switching Azerite Pieces doesn't force you to farm your artifact power all over again, and they're also much easier to acquire than legendaries.<br />
<br />
As Ian stated, It's actually a LOT easier to switch specs in BFA than it was in Legion, even if you keep multiple sets of azerite gear. If you think you'll need to switch specs often, that's why they have non-spec specific azerite traits, take them and you don't have to respec azerite each time you switch.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am not a world first fan. Never have been. I think in this game, with no real &quot;death tax&quot;. It's not really skill that gets you the world first (there definitely is some skill involved, don't get me wrong), rather your ability to sit and die over and over and over again for 18+ hours a day for a week. So I say this with all due respect:<br />
<br />
This is not gonna work for the people who are fans of the world first race. You will forever have people claiming that one side's boss was harder than the other's, or some such silliness. <br />
<br />
I do really like the Azerite Armor changes, though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You failed to read my post and this reaction is as poorly thought out as your initial comment. They designed the entire game trying to make it fun, AKA they are judging what's fun for players all the time. The fact that loads of people are playing it and they are pretty much the biggest name in the industry means they are largely successful and correct in their judgment as well. The uninformed thoughts of &quot;Pobutati the random from the forums&quot; are irrelevant and wrong.</div></div><hr />

What expansion was that? In Legion it was &quot;You want to switch specs? Fuck you and spend another six weeks farming up AP and relics for your other Artifact just to get anywhere near to where your main artifact is, and you cannot pay gold to transfer any AP from your main wep. You have to grind. If you run without your golden traits, your spec will not perform even 50% within your main spec.&quot;<br />
<br />
No one off-spec'd at all for the first chunk of Legion because of Artifacts. It took them quite a while to fix that.<br />
<br />
It's like you actually forgot that little important tidbit. Azerite is a replacement of artifacts, that's why we grind AP for the traits. Saying &quot;but the tier sets swapped&quot; while forgetting artifacts and legendaries is only presenting 1 side of the coin. <br />
<br />
<br />
Like, he literally said they will fix the numbers and buff the low end tanks and, potentially, nerf the high end tanks. The stuff about utility is important as it helps clarify where Blizzard would like the tanks to eventually be - each possessing unique strengths and weaknesses. He said &quot;it was bad in the past the tank could die despite correct play by just getting burst down&quot; - hello why past tense, this is happening all over mythic Uldir again. My blood DK can easily die from normal melee hits on Zek'voz every time I move the boss between rings. Yes, I am using my cds on the &quot;combo&quot;, and yes I die at different moments when no combo is happening. <br />
<br />
And the stuff about utility is bullshit, best survivable tanks have also the most useful utility in raids atm, it's not even either or. <br />
<br />
And even if they buff warriors and druids that doesn't change the fact paladins and demon hunters are still unwanted in mythic raiding, they're only used in m+ (and they're still significantly behind dks).</div></div><hr />

Ion is so weird about this. He just really, really wants people to stick to one spec even though a) a lot of people do and probably don't care whether they are &quot;rewarded&quot; for it, and b) a lot of people don't and find the things they do to make it difficult extremely frustrating.

<br />
It really isn't just a game, it's a hobby to people, and one they are extremely invested in. The angry responses should always be viewed in that light. I'm enjoying raiding but I really think they've made some pretty bad moves this expansion. Not letting azerite swap traits with a spec change is one of them. They really need to not punish us for changing specs. The harm that does is much less than the harm they do when they make people reluctant to swap to tank or healing because they don't have &quot;the right kind of gear&quot;. <br />
<br />
While they are at it, they should consider that mythic plus &quot;replacing&quot; raids is probably a bad model unless they go to 6M or 7M dungeons because the ration of dps to healer is higher in raids, which means more dps, which means more players playing your game (since most play dps). The last time they screwed over demographics (25M to 10M) they created a Cataclysm of the kind they did not actually want.</div></div><hr />

If the game was so bad that they have millions of millions drooping they will have change it already or announce a big change on 8.1<br />

The true is, as far as i can tell with all the change they did for BFA, the game is really active, alot of new ppl have join, i have notice it on my guild that for the first time after 2 expansion WoD and Legion, we back to have 2 Mythic raid progressions groups.<br />
<br />
LOL, and for how bad Azorite gear is, really we progressing through Mythic. So yeah i dont get why ppl complain.<br />

Cant see it happening myself. Only they know the true extent how many people<br />
stopped subscriptions and the General health of the Game. but we haven't even hit the mid expansion lull.<br />

Personally I think Ion is on borrowed time in the job, there's such a disconnect its just not registering with him<br />
or the team just how unhappy people are. Yes people were pissed with WOD but nothing on this scale.<br />
they keep saying about how BFA was the fasted selling one, and we know why, because it allowed access to new races<br />
when Legion was starting to get tired and people wanted something new straight away.<br />
<br />
apparently they spend 21 minutes talking about azerite armor if that doesn't tell us he's seriously worried nothing will <br />
they can mess around all they like, they need a plan B and drop the entire system mid 2019 and bring in something else<br />
that links in with the story. <br />
<br />
going down the route of only keeping the neck and opening that up to a new talent system. Dropping the other azertite items<br />
adding an extra tier isn't going to keep this going for the duration of the expansion its failed after 6 weeks.</div></div><hr />

Because it flows from their assumption that somehow people who play one and only one character and spec are more wedded to that character and that they need to encourage this.<br />
<br />
They also likely have some bullshit notions that run along the lines that if they made it too easy to have multiple geared characters and that to cover all specs of a class you only really needed one character that it would wreck their precious e-sports delusions...<br />
<br />
god knows why they do anything but a lot of their crap stems from whatever axiomatic truths they have sat around and navel-gazed up in their groupthink meetings. eventually they will shift around what they &quot;think&quot; is best and what was bad before will come around again as the greatest innovation ever in the history of gaming.<br />

Nah..obviously does not..here is the 100000% proof: &quot;It felt odd to need multiple of the exact same item to cover multiple specs with a set bonus.&quot;<br />

&quot;Azerite armor is more flexible than normal items, as you can change the traits.&quot; Took out reforge...being proud about it....again, just WTF is he talking about?<br />

&quot;The team wants to provide some way for you to target items from a specific dungeon, but they don't have a great solution yet.&quot;<br />

Rep gates were the biggest whine, not &quot;badge&quot; acquisition. You could get VP from pretty much anywhere and it all went to the same cap. I got most of mine from Pet battles and Dailies. Which is how it should be now, sans horrible rep gates. Points from any activity done at lvl cap and vendors with no rep gates.<br />

because that is how wow class design works now - they &quot;can't&quot; add things to base specs, because in 10 years they might have to prune abilities again, and that would just be terrible, so instead they invent new temporary systems each expansion that are designed to be removed when the expansion ends</div></div><hr />

I did forget that early on, clearing a raid didn't cap you, so there was some complaining there. But the loudest and most persistent, throughout the Xpac was rep tied to VP vendors. <br />
<br />
Regardless of that, Any sort of player control over loot would be better than the shitty rng fest presented to us now. <br />

Sorry but Valor completely outdoes the system we have today. Tying it to rep was meh but still Valor and Justice were the two perfect systems which were literally what bad luck protection is.<br />
<br />
Valor guarantees me a reward after a set time. Even if it takes 2 weeks.<br />
<br />
The current system of &quot;bad luck protection&quot; is... YOU MIGHT GET A REWARD AFTER TIME.<br />
<br />
They really should take a look at how FF14 handles it's bad luck protection because quite frankly.... WoW doesn't have any. <br />
<br />
An example from FF14. EX Primals drop a decent weapon. Current one is 385. But it's one weapon per kill. HOWEVER it also drops an item and when you get 10 of that item you can go buy a weapon from a vendor. <br />
<br />
That is GOOD bad luck protection. WoWs is the complete opposite and pretty much &quot;hey you might get an item that is better or not or you might get an item after time has passed&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Ion is so weird about this. He just really, really wants people to stick to one spec <br />
<br />
Because it flows from their assumption that somehow people who play one and only one character and spec are more wedded to that character and that they need to encourage this.<br />
You know what's the best way to encourage this? <br />
Actually balancing your goddamn specs you put into the game. <br />
When you have specs like marksmanship that have more restrictions, less utility and lower dps than beastmastery, who in their right mind would stick to a spec like that? <br />
When you have people dedicated to their prot warrior, shadow priest or feral druid and they keep getting decline after decline from m+ and raiding guilds? <br />
<br />
I miss the times when people believed doesn't matter which spec you play, as long as the player behind it knows how to play. At the moment fotm spec &gt; skill. <br />
<br />
<br />
&gt; Someone that is dedicated to a spec should have a small advantage over someone who is constantly switching.<br />
<br />
and<br />
<br />
&gt; It's important to remember that tanks bring different things to the fight.<br />
&gt; When evaluating tanks, keep in mind what they are bringing to a fight as part of their toolkit.<br />
<br />
In otherwords, fuck tanks. You have different toolkits, so you'll get to tank some fights but not others. Which means you need to swap back and forth between tank and dps and back every raid. So fuck you, you don't get the advantage that people who play one spec get. Worse, you get into a situation a dps gears 1 toon while a tank has to gear 2-3 and only see specific fights on specific classes and never get a full raid clear on 1 toon. We had a situation like that during Antorus, 1 of the tanks was bringing blood dk alt because encounter demanded it, and he was very sad he could never complete the mythic tier set on his main. He was tied to forever swap to blood dk on the fight that dropped the helmet. <br />
<br />
Most guilds keep some backup dps to rotate in and out depending on demands of the fight, but most guilds do not keep backup tanks. In most guilds, a tank is a tank. If a fight requires a blood dk, a brewmaster or a vengeance demon hunter, you don't tell your tank to swap to dps and your dps to swap to tank to cover that role. No, the tank has to prep an alt and relog it for that fight. <br />
<br />
In a perfect world every tank has similar survivability, every tank has different utility that helps on some encounters, but you can still do them with other tanks. <br />
<br />
In a world of warcraft the disparities between tank survivability are huge (monk never dies while pressing 1 button, but some other classes have to perfectly time their active mitigation and be babysat by healers when they're out of charges), and the utility is a problem, either some utility is so important it becomes essential (like that mass grip on Aggramar) or some tanks never bring anything of interest to the raid (when was the last time you wanted a warrior tank for some specific utility?)</div></div><hr />

They're spending more and more time trying to design fixes for Azerite abilities, which tells me they're in too deep to abort the design altogether. <br />
<br />
As for the next 18 months, its more like 21 months as it'll be 2 years until the next expansion. Good news is that I won't be gritting my teeth...i'll be playing Black Ops 4 and (most likely) Red Dead Redemption 2. <br />
<br />
As far as I'm concerned, Blizzard owes us money for giving us half an expansion that was a bug ridden mess. <br />
<br />
i'm willing to call it now: BFA is the worst expansion in WoW history. Warlords of Draenor had a lack of end game content and garrisons were a mistake, but class balance and progression was at least predictable and relatively balanced. Nothing is working in BFA right now except for dungeons and raiding, and thanks to mythic+ the class deficiencies are amplified.</div></div><hr />

I think you guys are missing a key point here. I am not DEFENDING the current system, I'm more pointing out how flawed the VP system truly was, ergo going back to a flawed system is NOT the answer. The current system isn't good, I get that, but if they're going to fix this they need to try new ideas, or the main reason I've quoted eleccybubb here for how FF14 does it, to steal better ideas from someone else.</div></div><hr />

<br />
you know, it doesn't HAVE to be the fucked up mists system or any other past system for earning currency. they caused the problem by making it hard to cap valor unless you did a dungeon and a scenario daily because the first one had a big bonus and you got zip for later ones.<br />
<br />
in cataclysm, they had a good system - 150 valor per heroic dungeon and you could do 7 of them at any time during the week, not having to do it once a day.<br />
<br />
basically a currency system that allows people to cap on a weekly basis doing things they like rather than trying to force daily play due to once a day bonuses on certain content essentially would remove almost all the problems people had with &quot;having to things&quot;. <br />
<br />
It's the urgency of having to do it in a certain time frame that there are numerous solutions to and is totally solved by an escalating cap and making any activity's currency rewards equal whether you do 1 in a day or 15 in a day or wait 3 weeks and earn your entire cap over a weekend.<br />

<br />
Short version / issues: UH DK has too many damage buttons to press, pet needs a buff and the spec has movility issues.<br />
<br />
Expanded version / fixes:<br />
<br />
- Death coil should be renamed to Spiral Plague and include death strike healing effect (maybe reduce the healing effect a little bit, not sure about it). Death strike removed with this (better selfhealing and one less button)<br />
<br />
- Epidemic must replace death coil and be stronger (too many buttons for the UH spec)<br />
<br />
- The permanent pet needs lots of fixes:<br />
<br />
· Way more resistance<br />
· Reduce its casting animation or increase its speed since it lasts too much time to spawn<br />
· Must has a taunt<br />
· Pet's name choice is a must (same for talent 2nd pet and same for Warlocks pets)<br />
· Basic stun should be 2s and buffed version should be 3s<br />
· &quot;All will serve&quot; 2nd pet attacks need a visual improvement (at least green plague arrows or something)<br />
<br />
- Wraith walk should replace the baseline sprint (still being able to attack while it lasts), its CD should go down to 30 seconds and could has a gliding effect like mage/moonkin/priests have<br />
<br />
- Antimagic shield must last 10 seconds by default and have a slight passive effect<br />
<br />
- Army of the dead CD should be 4min by default (if you think that's too OP reduce its damage a little bit)<br />
<br />
- Death Grip should be able to be used on allies (maybe to reach them so you can quite better, or to drag them to where you are)<br />
<br />
- Necrotic strike should be a passive effect and not another button to press<br />
<br />
<br />
With this the spec should be way smoother to play I think.</div></div><hr />

Legendaries were the smallest of the 3 pillars which gearing in Legion was based on:<br />
1. Artifact Weapon<br />
2. Tier sets<br />
3. Legendaries<br />
<br />
Azerite gear on the other hand is the ONLY gearing system of this expansion. And it sucks. There is no way to blow it out of proportion. WoW is a reward driven game. The primary reward is gear. If your expansion just has ONE gearing system and this one system is shit.....the whole game has a problem. How can one blow this out of proportion? Sit back and watch the cinematics (the only part of BFA that is truely above average!!) while accepting that actually playing the game for gear is just not that great right now?</div></div><hr />

I seriously give up. I thought tomb of sargeras tank balance was bad when there were 5 bears for every non bear tank, but it's the same clown fiesta now just with brewmaster instead... Checking logs from mythic Ghuun 80-something brewmasters and other tanks counted on the fingers of a hand (warrior was even not found at all). Bosses meleeing casually for 100k before mitigation, but also before any buffs / special abilities, and healers throwing 15k heals towards me. Amazing balance. <br />
<br />
I tanked since ICC in wotlk. Never before felt so powerless. Fewer tanking cds than ever, and smaller hp pools (in wotlk I had 2-3 times more hp than a dps, now I maybe have 50% more than what they got), useless tank trinkets across the board, no more &quot;tank&quot; enchants existing. <br />
<br />
Waiting half an expansion until my main is viable playing an alt, because balance. Then BFA comes and it's even worse, can't play either because none of the 2 are a brewmaster. Tried to level one. Boring as hell. Can't play a brewmaster since post-WOD pruning and removal of chi. Benching until this horrid tier is over, while the raid is tanked by 2 brewmaster alts.</div></div><hr />

Or perhaps up it to 6 9 12 (so you have a reason to run higher keys than you usually do).<br />
<br />
Let's say you run Freehold 6 7 8, only the first one of those will have a chance to drop 355 Azerite piece for you, then you run 9 10 11, same thing applies but rewards 370, and if you go 12+ you have a chance for a 385 from the first one as well.<br />
This will not be used from the normal loot table, so if you're lucky (low chance of course), multiple people could get Azerite pieces + regular loot from the chest.</div></div><hr />

From a design point of view, not being able to farm &quot;interesting&quot; traits from dungeons for all your specs goes against the design philosophy in the first place and undermines all the hard work put into traits and class diversity.<br />
<br />
The design philosophy has changed, it is now almost the same as the D3 philosophy. This new &quot;season&quot; label they're using is all you need to know, patches aren't &quot;tiers&quot; anymore, because they're phasing tier based gaming out, or at least the emphasis and attention to them. &quot;Season&quot; is what D3 uses, and Ion flat out said they see Mythic as the real end game now. Gear doesn't matter now. Lore said as much, they don't want you to care about traits. He didn't just pull that out of his permed poodle ass, he used the royal &quot;we&quot; on that statement. All that matters now is AZ and ilevel. Traits? Glyphs? Sets? Pfffff. Get in Mythic and get grinding, scrub. <br />
<br />
D3 is the same. You wear the set they hand you for grinding Paragon. No deviations, and you're locked in, whatever you choose. Alt? Start over. You're drowning in gear, but only one specific set really works the way the class is intended. Professions are pointless - so much so they removed mats and put them in a menu, because they were clogging up people's bags, there was so much of it. Bounties are WQs - incremental bonuses. You can't even farm for lower level characters anymore, because drops are class specific. And Personal Loot. Gee...I wonder where that will show up? <br />
<br />
If I were more paranoid, I'd wonder what that means for the future of WoW. No more expansions, just &quot;seasons&quot;. Just like D3. And then quietly stop updating the whole thing. <br />
<br />
Pace is the key word here now, not polish. He flat out said in the Forbes interview they just shipped what they had done, because the deadline was more important than the quality. That's what you can expect, from here on out. <br />
<br />
This is not the WoW you think you know. They can't be more obvious about it. Adapt, or die. <br />
<br />
Gonna be an interesting expansion. And, don't bother complaining, or providing &quot;constructive criticism&quot;. They don't care. They'll pretend to, and Ion will say some glib things in a Q&amp;A to pretend he's concerned, but they're plowing ahead, with Lore telling us what Ion really meant, which is &quot;you're too stupid to play this game if you don't like it, douchebag.&quot; They pretend to &quot;listen&quot;, and maybe do small tweaks, so you'll settle down and just keep paying. Azerite is here to stay. Everything they shipped, they intended to, and if it wasn't done? Oh well. They might get to it in 8.1. Patches are now catch up time. We'll get to shaman and shadow priests and new worgen models when we get to them, so shut up and keep grinding mythic, because that's Fun™.<br />
<br />
Never forget - the only reason they changed any of it was a massive outcry. They intended to ship what they did, saw nothing wrong with it, and are begrudgingly changing it now. Because fuck you, how dare you criticize the Holy Developers. <br />
<br />
Stop listening to what they say, especially Ion. Pay attention to what they DO. It's not pretty, if you think anything is changing any time soon. He's overtly trying to bamboozle you. It's time to wake up and realize this guy does not respect you, your money, or your time invested in the game. He treats his customers like children, and then his pet poodle calls them douchebags when they act like children.</div></div><hr />

yeah, normal raid uldir can be done in like a hour. Are high m+ keys a 20 min content? You have how many dungeons in whole BFA so far- 10? Each have like 4-5 bosses to kill and based on week affixes every dungeon feels like new challenge. And uldir? Uldir has just 8 static bosses.</div></div><hr />

Guess there is no point continuing this discussion, if you truly believe it's normal that &quot;most of the players are doing 1-2 Mythic+ per week&quot;.<br />
<br />
And if you believe Normal Uldir is what we're talking about, too.</div></div><hr />

A ring with spec-specific only sounds good<br />
<br />
<br />
Someone that is dedicated to a spec should have a small advantage over someone who is constantly switching.<br />
There is already a disadvantage: having to know more than one spec/rotation/utility/UI... they are just adding another disadvantage on top of it :mad:<br />
<br />
<br />
The 9 bosses that exist may be in the same order for both factions. Alliance may play through the entire battle, then have the recap of what they missed. Horde players may get their flashback moment during the middle of the raid.<br />
That sounds way less interesting than the &quot;...separate faction experiences...&quot; stated earlier :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
So in opposition to every design decision for years ?<br />
<br />
Why does your agility gear turn into int gear when you switch to a healing spec then. <br />
<br />
Remove all that and lets go back to having a int set and an agility set for druids , and a strength set and int set for paladins. Hell lets put block and defence back on some plate and crit and hit on other.<br />
<br />
You just want people to farm your skinner box more , have some backbone and admit it.</div></div><hr />

Is nuance a difficult concept? Difficult to figure out that &quot;a bit of friction&quot; means &quot;a bit of friction&quot;? Maybe the English is too hard? If so, &quot;a bit of friction&quot; means &quot;not the exact same set of gear between specs&quot;.<br />

<br />
No they aren't. If you're so bad that learning a new spec is difficult then yes it's friction, but that friction has never changed.<br />
<br />
The ONLY case in WoW history where gear was completely shared (in endgame) between specs was pure DPS specs in TBC. Since then, tier sets have been spec specific OR gear has had different stats OR we've had artifacts.<br />
<br />
In BfA, if azerite gear wasn't a choice you had to pay to change, we would only need to change weapons and trinkets for some specs, the rest would share all gear.<br />
<br />
Azerite gear is too rare, but it isn't too restrictive compared to what we've had in the past.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I like the %performance of his key runs and raids, especially the raids. <br />
Says quite something about his &quot;archievements&quot; and the state of resto shaman, I want to be constructive about it but I cant, here we clearly have someone unable to play a class and telling others how they should play the game or a class that is utterly worthless and/or actively hampering others by paticipating in raids/mythics.<br />
What is worse? Im sure I dont have to answer that.<br />
<br />
And Im also aware now why he thinkgs Blood DK is to strong (he is, but mainly because others tanks are mediocre at best, like he even admitted) and needs a hitting from the side, because he had worse healing in EVERY SINGLE mythic kill they archieved.<br />
His keys look just the same and while I was to lazy to check those aswell, Im 99% sure he just got carried by DPS.<br />
<br />
Its an actual tragedy to have someone with 370 gear level and 0 performance telling others what is the best for them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Azerite is the shittest thing they've ever added into the game, just delete it next patch and put tier back in again please.</div></div><hr />
