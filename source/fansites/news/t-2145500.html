<br />
Beast Mastery Hunter Legendary Change<br />
The belt change is part of an overall balance pass on a few legendaries, following what Lore mentioned a couple of weeks ago, and wasn't meant as a specific targeted change to the BM rotation.<br />
<br />
To be frank, I don't play Beast Master, so I'm not fully aware of the &quot;consequences&quot; of this legendary, specifically, to the rotation. I read that it resolved focus issues, but our goal should be for these legendaries to augment gameplay, not to provide a necessary change to the spec such to that it cannot perform without it. Feel free to enlighten me.

Fire is not a garbage specc without bracers, they should really just buff the specc so people can get over this fucking wrist.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah they are. And this is coming from someone who got the bracers, imagine how it feels for the people who don't get to play with that op item and in high-end guild their mages get benched if they don't have it. People sim like 50-80k dps increase from bracers and personally I had ~70k dps increase from that item alone. Such numbers break the game, because a really good player will get outperformed by a decent player just because the decent player had more legendary luck. Maybe they don't have to balance the spec around having wrists now because fire single target dps without wrists is currently quite sad on live.</div></div><hr />

Poor Shockadins. All that investment in to separate builds, trinkets, gemming and so on... undestandable though, seen one Holy Paladin do 500k burst for a 8 seconds then 250k sustained on M+ boss.</div></div><hr />

Indeed, the bracers will be stronger now with Aoe VB, and legendary wise yes garbage. I mean the ring spreads dots to few targets, that should be all in x range. <br />
<br />
I'm fully expecting a total riot.<br />
<br />
There was the exceptional opportunity to add a legendary to SP that gives us Aoe DPS, hell no! Terrible game made even more terrible thanks to window lickers from the D3 team.<br />

I guess it'll just make the new trinket or Cloak more desirable...</div></div><hr />

Tell me how its not op. If fire mage hasnt got it his pyro hits %50 less (at live %20 chance × %300 more dmg (4x total dmg) = %80 overall buff). Yea its not op bracer buff your pyro dmg %80 yea yea you are right. Change its proc chance to %5 than fire mages who hasnt got it can feel they are competitive</div></div><hr />

To be frank, I don't think anyone at Blizzard does. It's such a profoundly broken pile of poop atm. After 15 years of development not only have they been unable to make a functional pet system but it's actually gotten worse.</div></div><hr />

Why have pure dd classes still in the new year 2k17?!<br />

<br />
But thats not good enough for the rogue class, most spec mechanics need rework and the numbers corrected, too. This abomination of a class is no longer a rogue.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It isn't OP UNLESS you have RNG on your side i can get for 4m or it can hit for 900k so its only if you can get high end back to back crits off the wrists and that's on live and then even so on most fights it will only bring you in line with other DPSs feel free to read the mage forums on the math and calculations analaysis its been looked at in depth by all.<br />
<br />
On next patch you will also not have icy floes which is the core issue as you can ALWAYS get your wrist cast off, not sure if also bugged but I believe shimmer was also cancelling the cast so good luck hardcasting for 4s then having to move at 3s.<br />
<br />
<br />
They nerfed pyroblast damage in total by 6% on live, then nerfed crit modifiers, then buffed then nerfed again modifiers, then &quot;nerfed bracers I believe from its original 350% to current live 300%&quot;<br />
<br />
Then on PTR nerfed bracers to 200% then buffed to 250% then buffed to 275% and now reverted back to 300% as per live, they also nerfed Pyrectic incantation by I believe 50% of its live state.<br />
<br />
Fact is blizzard cannot balance this game anymore and is clueless about the issues of classes, people are being their usual troll self's like the frost mage above me but the amount of changes in next patch I have very little faith that the 90% (shrug) of the mage community who is currently fire will not get screwed in next patch and its not just bracer related.</div></div><hr />

yup if you go by those numbers and simplistic calculation its &quot;almost&quot; as bad as when it was only 200% spellpower.<br />

So yes they will hit hard again but you will see less of them which isn't a bad thing but will penalise heavily if you miss a cast as you have to move etc.</div></div><hr />

We have 3 mages. 2 with wrists/ring 1 with neck/helm. The one with the shittest legendaries pisses on the 2 with bis. So this statement is bs.</div></div><hr />

What's best is that 1 mage legendary was a good 80k DPS gain whilst both BiS shadow priest legs are like a 50k gain, sure shadow is op because of STM, but they've nurfed that now.... And the belt so riperoni on SP.</div></div><hr />

False, I got benched early on in the expansion because other people got their bis legendary's and the guild was in hurry for server rank so they made sure to take the people that had the insane strong legendary's over the people that were unlucky. The whole system is retarded and a failed ploy to try to get people to constantly play and not cancel subs in fear of falling behind.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You are wrong here. :) Some high-end guild players chose their mains depending on how good legendaries they got on each character. Even Exorsus GM wrote about this problem so that should be enough proof for you; they had people who got bad leges to do a new character of the same class/reroll.<br />
<br />
<br />
We have 3 mages. 2 with wrists/ring 1 with neck/helm. The one with the shittest legendaries pisses on the 2 with bis. So this statement is bs.<br />
And this would mean that the 2 mages with bis leges got no idea what they are doing. They need to fuck up their play big time to lose that 70-100k advantage from the legendaries on ST. The statement was about decent players.</div></div><hr />

Pretty much this but I still don't think it will hit hard enough as of yet there are some very heavy movement fights like assembly.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As a mage who was benched for Cenarius mythic prog because our other mage had wrists and Diadem, I can confirm this :P Our raid leader flat out said he had to choose between the two of us and chose the other guy because he would do more dps because he had better legendaries.</div></div><hr />

Bracers likely won't be BiS for every fight in Nighthold due to high movement fights (belt + helm will probably be better for some fights), and even if it is, it will take exceptionally skilled players to use the bracers to their fullest potential without the ability to move out of fire on the fly. I imagine they will be very hard to use effectively in NH until we get our 4pc bonus for the haste boost.</div></div><hr />

I think you are throwing out the baby with the bathwater a bit. If the only legendaries were ones that provided utility (and in those examples utility means damage mitigation or extra sustain) then we would be seeing posts about how it was impossible for a guild to compete unless everyone had sustain legendaries so they could run one less healer on progression raids. <br />
<br />
If my job is to do damage then a legendary that makes me run a little faster or take a little less damage or regen some health isn't interesting. It's just a boring boost to a stat I don't care about. <br />
<br />
There are problems with the existing legendary system. They could have been better balanced, the way they are acquired is pretty bad and the idea that bad luck with legendary drops could mean a player could go the entire way through the expansion without ever being able to be competitive in their chosen role is certainly less than ideal. To me the one thing they got right with the legendaries is that they feel legendary. If you get one, and are lucky enough to get a good one that's a pretty amazing feeling. That part they should keep. They definitely need to fix all the other issues but just reducing them to a dull stat stick with a bit of extra utility that nobody really cares about is the wrong solution. It's the easy solution for sure but in this case I would say it is the lazy one.<br />
<br />
I like the legendary system. It means pretty much anything I do in game has a chance to give a fantastic reward. It means there are items out there that change how the class feels to play. All this stuff is great. There's room for improvement but there is a lot of good stuff in there. You don't get to a great system by throwing out the entire thing because the first iteration isn't perfect.</div></div><hr />

Poor Shockadins. All that investment in to separate builds, trinkets, gemming and so on... undestandable though, seen one Holy Paladin do 500k burst for a 8 seconds then 250k sustained on M+ boss.<br />
<br />
Shadow belt should be baseline after legion, thats how good it feels. Problem I have with this tuning pass is changing legendaries like Mangaza's that have a positive feel on your rotation. Hell, the belt even made a bad talent viable. If it was percentage nerfs, I wouldn't mind.</div></div><hr />

Cry less and go to school learn the basics, these bracers are nerfed even more.<br />

By that logic if the chance was 100% to increase a hardcast pyro dmg by 60% you would be happy because 60*1 &gt; 275*0,2.</div></div><hr />
