FinalBossTV Developer Interview <br />
the FinalBossTV Interview (http://www.twitch.tv/finalbosstv/v/3591503) with on Ion Hazzikostas and Kris Zeirhut has finished! We strongly recommend watching the VOD (http://www.twitch.tv/finalbosstv/v/3591503) for more details on your class. If you are unable to view the VOD (http://www.twitch.tv/finalbosstv/v/3591503) we have a roundup below!<br />
<br />
General<br />
<br />
Server engineers would go home and sleep for 5-6 hours in the middle of the day, and then head right back to work at launch.<br />
A lot of problems were because particular servers had a large population of players who had quit during TBC or Wrath come back and inflate that server’s population to extreme levels.<br />
They are fine with the speed at which people are getting gear from garrison missions.<br />
Getting a new garrison raid mission is not based on the success or failure of a previous one.<br />
They want to go back and add data for older raids to the dungeon journal but it’s not a high priority.<br />
They will look into making http://media-azeroth.cursecdn.com/wow/icons/19085/small/inv_sword_2h_draenorcrafted_d_01_b.jpg Admiral Taylor's Greatsword (http://www.wowdb.com/items/118080-admiral-taylors-greatsword) transmoggable.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Items and Itemization<br />
<br />
They are happy with how warforged gear works at all levels, including mythic loot.<br />
They are probably going a larger gear gap between raid tiers compared to the past.<br />
Due to the exponential curve of power, there will be another item level squish in the future, but it “is a few years out”.<br />
They know the http://media-azeroth.cursecdn.com/wow/icons/19085/small/inv_misc_candle_01.jpg Everburning Candle (http://www.wowdb.com/items/118880-everburning-candle) is over budget, but they are fine with this for now. If they had this conversation 2 months ago, they would probably say “yep, it needs a nerf” but now that it is out there and people have spent lots of gold on it, they don’t feel they should nerf it.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Graphics<br />
<br />
They want to do a graphics update in the future to make it so that spell effects don’t all go to the exact same point on the body’s model and instead spread out.<br />
They feel the need to increase the graphics quality with each expansion in some way, even if it is a 10-year-old game.<br />
They feel that improvements could be made reduce to melee clutter from pets, such as making the Fire Elemental into a ranged guardian that still did the same damage.<br />
They have a plan to “fix” toys for druids so you can see transformation items/buffs outside of PvP. Mounted shapeshifts will still take the highest priority.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Class Changes<br />
<br />
General Information<br />
<br />
Some class balance changes will go live sometime tomorrow, with number changes around 5% where needed.<br />
There are only a few specs like Marksmanship Hunters and Windwalker Monks that are pulling a little too far ahead than the others.<br />
When a spec is top on both movement and stationary fights, they usually need to take a look at the spec.<br />
Everyone should be fairly equal in single target, although may still have niches (stationary vs movement). Once you get beyond single target, some might be good at cleave (2-3), some mass AoE, some burst AoE, etc.<br />
When there was 70% overhealing, absorbs felt more important. Now that overhealing is getting smaller (and will get even smaller in mythic) absorbs are starting to get where they feel just right.<br />
They like that all the healers have different strengths and weaknesses.<br />
They don’t expect there to be class mechanic changes in 6.1 or even 6.2 unless there is a large problem.<br />
They feel the pruning in a lot of classes is not complete. It will take them a while to get all the classes cleaned up. Shaman still feels like it has too many damage sources. You won't see these in the 6.1 or 6.2 timeframe however.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Talents<br />
<br />
Level 100 talents in general are have some serious balance issues compared against each other.<br />
They do think the level 100 talents that are underperforming but fun should get a buff in 6.1 or 6.2<br />
For talents that people do not think are fun, they may just leave them alone for now and completely replace them next expansion<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Warriors<br />
<br />
They don’t want warriors to feel they hit like “wet noodles” until the execute phase. If they end up feeling like this on fights, they will look into it. <br />
Gladiator was a little too high for single target. It was out performing the other single target.<br />
Gladiator should still be close to the same single target dps, but not have the same toolkit as the other specs.<br />
Arms and Fury will be brought up. They want to make sure Arms and Fury are doing the same single target as Gladiator. They don’t want to force people away from Arms and Fury to Gladiator based on DPS.<br />
If people are not using Shield Barrier (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/112048-shield-barrier) at any level of play, they will give it another look.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Shamans <br />
<br />
Healers are pretty close on performance. Resto Shaman is probably a little low, they should get a little bump.<br />
DPS shaman are probably on the low side and may get a small buff.<br />
Fire Nova (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/1535-fire-nova) is possibly still too strong.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Monks<br />
<br />
Challenge Modes revealed that Mistweaver Monks were a little low, which is the reason for the recent buffs.<br />
They have no performance tweaks in mind for Mistweaver Monks.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Death Knights<br />
<br />
They feel Blood Death Knights are using their magic too much and aren’t using their weapon enough. They need to make them use their strikes again, but it likely won’t be in the immediate future.<br />
<br />
<br />
Mages<br />
<br />
Fire and Arcane mages are pretty low. Frost is better but still on the low side. They want to make sure each spec is viable.<br />
They are happy with Rune of Power (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/116011-rune-of-power). However if you feel forced into it, they want to make sure there are other options.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Paladins<br />
<br />
Beacon of Faith (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/156910-beacon-of-faith) for Holy Paladins feels mandatory, and they think the other two talents need to be brought up to the same level.<br />
Empowered Seals (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/152263-empowered-seals) will be looked at in 6.1 along with the rest of the level 100 talents, and they will adjust it if it is too low or too high.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Priests<br />
<br />
Shadow Priest’s Clarity of Power (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/155246-clarity-of-power) is another example of the other talent options needing to be buffed to be more in line.<br />
Shadow Priests should be about multi-dotting when it comes to AoE. The amount that they can buff Mind Sear (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/48045-mind-sear) is limited because it can’t outpace Mind Flay (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/15407-mind-flay) in single target.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Warlocks<br />
<br />
The devs are still looking at Rain of Fire (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/5740-rain-of-fire) and what it has done for warlock specs. They weren't happy with Rain of Fire being used as a core part of a single target rotation. In hindsight, they would have handled the hotfix differently, especially the suddenness of it.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Rogues<br />
<br />
They don’t see any data that shows Rogues need changes at this time. They feel Rogues might still be dealing with the changes to combo points, and think that Rogues are pretty well represented across their specs.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hunters<br />
If Hunter stacking becomes an issue in Mythic raids, they can nerf Aspect of the Fox or even remove it. It was added mainly because it was felt that Marksmanship Hunters didn't bring enough raid utility.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Convert to Raid Developer Interview <br />
Convert to Raid (http://www.twitch.tv/gamebreakertv/b/596773377) had an Interview with Ion Hazzikostas &amp; Kris Zeirhut today. We have created a recap that you can check out below if you are not able to view the VOD! (http://www.twitch.tv/gamebreakertv/b/596773377)<br />
<br />
Patch 6.1<br />
The development team did not know there would not be flying for 6.1.<br />
New flightpaths and changes to them have been confirmed for 6.1.<br />
The new Blood Elf models will be available for 6.1.<br />
More information on patch 6.1 will be available in the near future. Soon.<br />
<br />
<br />
Classes<br />
We will see small class balance changes this Monday, before Highmaul Mythic is released. At most, a 5-10% range of changes.<br />
The first week of raid data is invaluable when making balance adjustments.<br />
If you don't see any changes for your spec/class, the design team probably thinks you're doing well from a numerical standpoint.<br />
Shamans need a bump, they're on the low side at the moment.<br />
They'd like to improve Elemental's mobile damage, but it will have to wait until 6.1 as it will require significant changes.<br />
All Mages are on the low end of the spectrum, and will be receiving buffs.<br />
Frost, the most played spec, is a lot lower than they'd like.<br />
The necessity of Crit on Fire Mages is problematic early on. They'll figure out a way to adjust it.<br />
Lots of players are playing Gladiator Warrior because of how well it is doing, and will be toned down a bit.<br />
Players gravitate towards the spec which deals the most damage, and Gladiator shouldn't be the answer for Warriors.<br />
Playstyle changes shouldn't be made via a hotfix, like the recent Warlock embers change. Players need more warning before that happens.<br />
They tried to remove a lot of positional requirements, which is why Glyph of Blackout Kick was removed.<br />
They may have gone too far with the removal of large heals. This could be addressed in the future via talents.<br />
There's a chance we'll see them ease up on class restrictions for gnomes. Gnome Hunter is probably one of the more likely combinations.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Stats<br />
The team is currently happy with the role that Spirit is playing.<br />
Versatility is no ones best stat, however, DPS should still be okay switching to it when they get a piece of gear that is higher item level. If that ends up not being the case, it will be looked into.<br />
There have been no regrets getting rid of Hit and Expertise.<br />
They like how all of the secondary stats now do something unique.<br />
There are no plans to allow for rerolling of stats, outside of the current profession reroll items.<br />
<br />
<br />
Garrisons<br />
Follower benefits are currently only taken into account when you collect your work orders. This will be changed in an upcoming patch so they must be present as work orders complete to get the bonus. We will be given notice before this change goes live.<br />
A change will be made so that your followers can earn experience while working in your buildings.<br />
There will be internal discussion about the number of high level garrison missions you receive.<br />
The change to salvage crates was made not because they're worried about you leveling up your followers' item levels too quickly, but because they don't want you to feel like you need to keep a low level follower around to make proper use of your garrison.<br />
We will see more garrison content during this expansion through new missions, better rewards, higher item levels, and hidden features.<br />
<br />
<br />
Raiding<br />
The team is happy with how well flex is working. Groups aren't aiming for a specific number of people, but inviting those who want to join.<br />
We're looking at a minimum of 2 raid tiers this expansion, 3 is not out of the question. Ideally, raid tiers last at least 6 months each.<br />
They'd like to reduce the time between raid tiers; 13 months was too long.<br />
The new LFG tool has had a huge impact on the community. People are more social.<br />
Highmaul<br />
Player response to Highmaul so far has been positive.<br />
The team is happy with the current tuning for Highmaul.<br />
Highmaul Normal has been tuned around you having 5 man Heroic dungeon gear, where Highmaul Heroic was tuned around having Highmaul Normal gear; A natural progression.<br />
Molten Core<br />
The revised Molten Core experience was not meant to be done more than once.<br />
They wanted to make sure it stayed faithful to the old experience. While 5 minute curses may not be added to the game today, it was an important part of experiencing MC.<br />
Some mechanics were adjusted as it was near impossible for 40 random people to get through them. The aggro radius on Golemagg was one of them.<br />
We probably won't see any other old school raids come into the LFR format.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Salvage Changes<br />
It's neither nerf nor bug, but rather intended to be a rebalancing that shifts some of the incentives away from spamming low-level missions (even after you have high-level followers), in favor of making high-level missions more rewarding. <br />
<br />
We made two changes:<br />
<br />
<br />
Level 90-94 missions will only award a Bag of Salvaged Goods (level 1 reward) regardless of the level of your Salvage Yard.<br />
Successful Level 100 missions will now always reward a salvage crate appropriate for your current Salvage Yard.<br />
<br />
<br />
Level 95-99 missions are unchanged. On balance, players who are trying to increase the item level of their followers should be receiving a similar number of follower upgrades as before, but hopefully with a bit less emphasis on logging in every hour or two to cycle through quick low-level missions.<br />

Gladiator is not a overpowering spec and is doing top end but in no way broken damage.<br />
Because the other two specs are currently in a shit state they feel making gladiator equally shit is the way forward? I will feel like the itemisation I have spent time and resources of my guild on will be worthless it they make it unviable like the other two specs are! Rather than nerfing (again) the strong spec, just buff the two which are underperforming so people are not pulled into gladiator!</div></div><hr />

This.<br />
<br />
If they nerf Glad stance AGAIN without touching Arms/Fury and the top parsing specs it's going to be ridiculous.<br />
<br />
I also refuse to touch the train-wreck that's arms in PvP right now and if they nerf Glad once more the spec is going to become unviable there.<br />

<br />
Completely agree. Im playing Glad because Arms and Fury get nerfed in someway almost every hotfix so the solution if now to nerf Glad. I would say, if blizz doesn't want me to play my warrior they should just say so, however with this expansion that is pretty much exactly what they have said.</div></div><hr />

Also this line I don't get &quot;They tried to remove a lot of positional requirements, which is why Glyph of Blackout Kick was removed.&quot;<br />
<br />

Bullshit. There won't ever be flying in current content, ever again - there hasn't been flying in current content since the patch in Cata that inflicted those terrible firelands dailies on us. (The Molten Front). <br />
<br />
At best, maybe they didn't know they'd slip on whatever new content they're planning that won't be on the main Draenor continent. They know damned good and well that they don't plan on letting us fly in any location we actually want to go.</div></div><hr />

More than likely you wont ever see that amount of raids again is that the writing team is probably starting to run out of idea's on where to take the lore of the game..<br />

Versatility is the new armor penetration, except wait! Armor penetration was a great stat, trash can this, it's not interesting in slightest.<br />

Salvage changes seem interesting and so does the fact that followers can finally level up while working.<br />

&quot;The revised Molten Core experience was not meant to be done more than once.&quot;<br />
Oh really is that why they implemented the extreme rare drop weapon enchantment and pet?<br />
27 full runs and pet received, still a month to go, to possibly attain the enchantment.<br />
If it's not meant to be run more than once, adjust the drop rates then! Yeah yeah rare drops are meant to be rare.. Well seems rare when 0 persons in most raids get the enchantment, 3-4 can get the pet. Nearly 30 runs and 2 enchantments have been given out and guess what people are running the instance for multiple times.. Yes the enchantment. Logic out the window.</div></div><hr />

Yes, I was talking about follower level.<br />

Point is, they're not nerfing your 645-ilvl weapon mission. They're just making it so people don't keep one 94 follower around forever just so they can get lots of salvage every couple of hours.</div></div><hr />

Are you fucking kidding me? Maybe make the other specs viable. I give up on this game. Glad was my last hope.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here's a new DPS spec, it's by far the most fun to play and is the only truly viable option on your class to raid! It's not in any way top end but we'll nerf it twice anyway because hey, fuck you, stop playing it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Classy design rhetoric, especially after people have started gearing for it specifically and now have nothing to fall back on? Not like you can just throw on a new weapon, it takes a different set entirely. Also, people play Gladiator because it is fun. Arms and Fury are trash tier design, currently. I've played some pretty scummy MMOs during my time off of WoW and none of them had a Warrior implementation anywhere near bad as current Arms, especially.<br />
<br />
This is getting to be too aggravating, so I'm probably done too. I'm sure there will be some viable option for Warrior but this kind of nonsense is a big part of the reason why I quit to begin with back in Cataclysm. Didn't think it'd be this bad anymore, but it seems even worse. I have way too many other games I should be playing anyway.</div></div><hr />

A ton of us kept a low level follower so we wouldn't get shut out of all the sub 100 missions that tended to be short in duration, so you could pump out a lot of missions and get more crates, which would level up your followers with the enhancements.</div></div><hr />

There have been a number of armoury parses on the front page showing that throughout the life of MOP the majority of players did not touch any raid difficulty higher than LFR which is consistent with the data on sites such as wowprogress from previous expansions as well as statements from Blizzard over the years.<br />

What was the last expansion? a caster dps was top, finally a caster aint stupidly OP and all you can do is cry? /get a grip.<br />

Fury warriors are bad, fire and arcane mages is bad, surv hunter is bad, bm hunter is ok but not that great atm, rogues are alittle low. This is good, these are all classes that have had OP dmg last expansions.. But im hoping for fury warrior buffs myself.</div></div><hr />

Yhe I still see it as lazy they were in beta for months, they knew which talents people were gravitating towards and which were avoided.

Pretty sure you're the retarded one if you want hybrids higher than pures, do you even play this game? Can't really say I'm crying I mean, look at what classes I have at 100. Mage will probably be my last class to 100. It's not my main so it's no skin off me but pures should never be lower than hybrids.

I, as one person, seem more capable of running simulations and seeing numbers - Then you are Blizzard.<br />
<br />
And that is quite amazing, because it does not take me 5 months, to just look at freaking numbers and go &quot;Huh, yeah, this thing is underperforming&quot;.<br />
<br />
Also, here's an idea - You could phase out gear with iLvL's in PvP and perform dampening, right?<br />
<br />
MAKE SOMETHING SIMILAR, SO YOU CAN HAVE BOTH PVP AND PVE BALANCE WITHOUT CHANGING THE BASELINE.<br />
<br />
Jesus f'cking christ, these developers seem lost in a god damn forest of confusion! Contradictions, stupidity and just blatant laziness.<br />
<br />
Jesus.<br />
<br />
How do you even get to that point of being so blind? I mean, you LITERALLY, STATE YOURSELVES, that there is specs outperforming Gladiator - But hey, instead of actually making Fury and Arms viable, let's just crap on Gladiator SOME MORE.<br />
<br />
WE AREN'T TOP, WE ARE MIDDLE OF THE PACK ON MYTHIC FFS.<br />
<br />
So, please, WHY, WHY, WHY, WHY do we have to go through this proccess of f'cking unproffesional god damn contradictionary statements and these plain LIES. <br />
<br />
You try to dictate why people play things, what is fun - But guess what, in the end, you just seem to sh't on whatever the f'ck you like!<br />
<br />
You don't seem to give a DAMN about balance, because by that coin, you COULD HAVE DONE A LOT OF THINGS RIGHT, compared to this f'cking mess.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Secondly glad warriors should be below arms and fury it's a prot off spec this is how it was explained in beta and it should not be the highest dps spec for warriors I find it a bit stupid it's a viable spec let alone top 5 dps if played right there are isn't diminished as the game mechs think there a tank remove the gimmick spec issue solved <br />
<br />
Thirdly your buffing frost mages because there not happy with there damage shadow priest haven't been happy since cata with there mid to bottom table damage they got no buffs I was not aware if we wasn't happy with being not op in one patch we could get free buffs<br />
<br />
As for rogues well sub is higher in all parses so why no buffs to combat and assassination as assassination and combat were usually go to raid specs sub was the pvp spec on some tunnel bosses sub was ahead but never top every fight the combo point thing is a poor excuse 90 percent of rogue population have asked for combos to be on them and not target since classic wow every good rogue has a addon like nug to track them there not an issue and there not the reason for low numbers <br />
<br />
Hunters are fotm it will fade as always survival and bm need bringing level <br />
<br />
Feral Druids are over performing melee but seem to be ignored a good feral in 630 hc is holding 22k in most cases 6 min fights <br />
<br />
Biggest joke was the wording of Mage buffs there not happy so we buff if you ask any class there not happy... Second joke of the expansion is glad spec warriors make them as they were intended a tanks off spec for single target tank fights not a competitive top tier dps spec why leaving pure dps classes like mages rogues hunters behind again</div></div><hr />

I'm sorry, what? You think it's a prot off-spec? Do you pay ANY attention, to the fact that they said they wanted it to be a VIABLE, DPS-spec.<br />

It's top 5 in Normals, and it's middle of the pack with lackluster AoE in Mythic.<br />

<br />
There is no hybrid tax, all dps should be equal because you only play one spec at a time. When you bring your boomkin to a fight you get zero benefit from your guardian OS. If pures did more nobody would bring hybrids.<br />
<br />
And mages (and more recently warlocks) have always been the top of the DPS charts so clearly there was no hybrid tax in the past either, not in reality.</div></div><hr />

Top DPS? I'm sorry - Do you watch ANY logs at all? Do you read what they LITERALLY say?<br />

Gladiator just so happens to be &quot;top of your spec&quot; - But that's not because it's INSANELY good<br />
<br />
It's top 5 in normals, and middle of the pack in Mythic with lackluster AoE.<br />
<br />
There just, MIGHT, be this issue of Fury and Arms being sh't. <br />
<br />
I mean, WW monks and MM hunters - they are out of line. They are too good, they said so themselves.<br />
<br />
But Gladiator is just being a black sheep. The f'ck is the reason it has to be sub-par? <br />
<br />
What the f'ck would even be the idea of making it a DPS spec, if it can't compete with other specs? What in the thousand burning hells, is your idea of balance - is MM hunters and WW monks can run amok - But somehow, the middle pack man needs to be shit on, cuz his competitors are complete and utter GARBAGE.<br />
<br />
It's like everyone lives in this half-life world, where a part of them wants to see Gladiator DPS yet no-one f'cking understands the meaning of DPS, so somehow, they must be sub-par and &quot;lol j/k not rly dps&quot;<br />
<br />

<br />
can YOU read? If Gladiator should not be on the top of Warrior DPS spec, then perhaps they should just make Arms and Fury less shit - because being middle of the pack on single target + Lackluster AoE in mythic and later on, does not justify a f'cking SECOND nerf to the spec.<br />

See, this is probably why you are not in charge of balacing - And people with that mindset shouldn't be:<br />
<br />
If you intend to balance a spec, take it seriously, never, ever, treat it as a gimmick spec.<br />

Then you failed your mission even before you began thinking about balancing.</div></div><hr />

Think of it like, every time you click on a target it automatically redirects all points to that target. That's why there is no redirect anymore. The combo points also don't get munched when your target dies, next time you click on a mob there they are.<br />
<br />
They should probably create a new UI for them. Until then I recommend using a custom UI (I use IceHUD but I think everyone else uses weakauras or something).<br />

I get what you're saying, but personally I think if glad was 1-5% behind Arms and Fury that would be fine, I mean if there are three specs and one of them sims slightly higher a lot of people will flock to it and I personally think it's strange if that winds up being Glad.</div></div><hr />

I did read the posts - You are just spouting things and acclaiming Gladiator should be inferior without a proper reason, while Fury and Arms is complete shite ; which is a miracle, because they had 5 months to fix it.<br />

<br />
1-5% behind Arms and Fury atm would COMPLETELY obliterate Warriors.<br />
<br />
They wouldn't even be considered an option for Mythic.<br />
<br />
Completely other idea if we somehow make Fury and Arms viable, but seeing how blizzard reasons and the fact that they had 5 months to see it already, i seriously doubt they will fix Warriors. They most likely will come up with some hap-hazzard excuse of why they have higher priorities, and leave WW monks/MM hunter DPS alike on the top, contradicting every single f'cking statement they ever made to even seem remotely appealing to the audience.</div></div><hr />

Step two. Leave glads <br />

Screw these guys, they will nerf gladiator to the ground until it's one of the bottom 3 specs, and then they'll bring Fury and Arms up to match that. It's crap, like alarms go off at Blizzard if a single warrior makes it to the top half of any DPS meter in the world I guess.</div></div><hr />

Hopefully balanced. Glad stance is kind of a joke anyway when you think about it. I mean what did you expect when you have 2 other specs that do the same job better than glad stance should? Should leave it what it is and basically a dps improvement for tanks to swap to when they get taunted off of. I mean this in the sense of roles like which should be better for aoe, slightly better single target etc. Stuff like that. How would you fit glad stance in all of that and expect all 3 to shine?

You do realize that Gladiator stance, is something you can't switch out of - when in combat, right?<br />
<br />
And that you are effectively taking 25% more dmg, because you are not in defensive stance?<br />
<br />
And how is it a joke? It's like i would call out every DPS that is below Gladiator warrior, to be a joke. &quot;Hey, i am doing more DPS then you, lol what a joke you are. I mean, you are doing worse? Amirite?&quot;.<br />
<br />
Glad stance, can be fit in the sense of that it can have high survivability (Which it does, a lot of personal CD's but no raid CD) - Mediocre to high Single target DPS and lacking AoE.<br />
<br />
Then, you have Fury, which can do high single target, mediocre AoE, has a Raid CD - but not quite as much survivability.<br />
<br />
Arms, high AoE, mediocre to high Single target, and has a raid CD - and again, not as much survivability.<br />
<br />
The issue, remains to be that Arms and Fury is complete shite at the moment. Which is the only issue i have, with even uttering Gladiator and Fury/Arms in the same sentance.</div></div><hr />

Did i ever state that the developers are wrong in doing this?<br />
<br />
My entire gripe, during all this time, has been that Fury and Arms perform like shite - Which Gladiator gets to suffer for, for no obvious reason.<br />

You are making no sense at all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And what does that leave us? *Drumroll*<br />
<br />
Ok, so when it's about nerfing, it's &quot;we becomes unviable&quot;, and when it's about buffing &quot;we are left to words of Blizzard&quot; ?<br />
Stop being so negative :(<br />
<br />
<br />
What worries me is that by nerfing the specs that everyone is playing (MM hunters, Glad warriors, WW monks) they will inevitably make raids/CMs harder. I would've prefered a buff to underperforming specs, this &quot;fix&quot; is lame.<br />
<br />
They can't balance the game just by buffing specs, the game would become easier than intended.</div></div><hr />

wtf is this stupid stuff? Doesn't matter if they are under this and that class! Ffs.. mages ain't OP, SO WHAT? Just because mages are lower dps than these 2 classes that you are mentioning, doesn't mean its bad. It's good! What was the last expansion? a caster dps was top, finally a caster aint stupidly OP and all you can do is cry? /get a grip.<br />
<br />
Fury warriors are bad, fire and arcane mages is bad, surv hunter is bad, bm hunter is ok but not that great atm, rogues are alittle low. This is good, these are all classes that have had OP dmg last expansions.. But im hoping for fury warrior buffs myself.<br />
<br />
What he said makes perfect sense. Hybrid classes should NEVER do more damage than a pure dps class. Ever. I say this as a fury warrior. What reason do you have to bring pure dps classes if they do less dps AND can't fill in as other functions? tank/heals</div></div><hr />

&quot;They'd like to reduce the time between raid tiers; 13 months was too long.&quot;<br />
<br />
ahahahahh... aha... oh, wait, they're serious. This, right after: <br />
<br />
&quot;We're looking at a minimum of 2 raid tiers this expansion, 3 is not out of the question. Ideally, raid tiers last at least 6 months each.&quot;<br />
<br />
If they do 2 raid tiers of 6 months apiece then that's 12-13 months of content. If they want a shorter tier... um... thats an 18 month expansion AT MOST. I wonder if people there talk to each other. Oh wait... <br />
<br />
&quot;The development team did not know there would not be flying for 6.1.&quot;<br />
<br />
sigh. how the hell does your development team not know this? And if the devs aren't deciding this (or rather their input isn't sought)....<br />
<br />
Wow, did you even read what you wrote? A 13 month TIER was too long, not expansion. They want 6 monthish tiers. THINK people. They level of idiocy in this thread is apalling...</div></div><hr />

So once again we have to pay more for less? We have to pay more because they are able to create content faster so we can consume it faster? What a joke.<br />

When they said we want to release expansions faster I was thinking we would get the same amount of content without a year long break between the last tier and the new expansion but instead they just scrap a whole tier. That's just great.</div></div><hr />

2: So they have no plans to fix the AA in the game? I wouldn't call altering a major part of the graphics engine so it looks inferior to Vanilla an increase lol.<br />
<br />
3: No flying in 6.1 is going to suck, it's may be okay for people who just want to stand in their garrison all day or people who haven't been 100 that long, but for the majority of us it's already grown tiresome/old. Blizzards approach to this seems to be similar to Labour's election campaign in the UK, they are adamant that their leader (Ed Miliband) isn't useless and the public just need to &quot;see the real Ed&quot; then they will be on side, we have seen him, we don't like him. Blizzard likewise seem adamant that we need to see all the cool things they have done and not be able to skip anything (thus making quests take more time) but once you have seen it 100 times it becomes tedious to have to see it again. I.E having to sit on the flightpath to near Highmaul because you have to ride afterwards is super boring, being able to fly there from your garrison would be quicker and simply better in every way.</div></div><hr />

When you bring your boomkin to a fight you get zero benefit from your guardian OS. If pures did more nobody would bring hybrids.<br />
<br />
And mages (and more recently warlocks) have always been the top of the DPS charts so clearly there was no hybrid tax in the past either, not in reality.<br />
<br />
Should but not the case. Let's imagine a situation where there is a boss that chains an aoe that damages the raid and prevents healers from casting :) Would you want hybrids who can provide additional healing and silence immunity and the cost of less dps or all pures who bring little to nothing. All dps should not be equal. <br />
<br />
If say we lived in a world where utility spells could be purchased off the AH and used like bloodlust drums then yeah sure I don't care who does more dps since everyone can bring the same functionality. Remember that 1 week in MoP when mages got their bombs nerfed and they blew the forums up because they bring nothing to the raid other than great dps?</div></div><hr />

<br />
The numbers in those charts are consistent with the numbers shown on wowprogress throughout Wrath and Cata as well as comments from Blizzard such as only 1-2% Guilds stepped foot in classic Naxx, less than 5% completed SWP in TBC and that LFR was needed as the amount players raiding did not justify the expense of creating raids.<br />
<br />
But, yeah, you're right player behaviour that has remained pretty much constant for ten years has changed overnight for absolutely no reason.<br />
<br />
Oh, and as for comment about hybrid class the so-called hybrid tax has not existed for several years now.<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
The chart is number of characters, not number of players. Some people have done SoO on more than one character.<br />
<br />
If that was true it would mean that even less people were raiding, however a little reading would reveal &quot;The data used today is a sample made up of 6.9 million characters from 2.5 million accounts, with at least one character active after November 1. The sample is slightly biased, as players who are not in a guild are much less likely to appear in our sample.&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
I get what you're saying, but the part where I struggle with the relevancy of a 'hybrid tax' is this: if an elemental shammy stops dpsing to off-heal, and the mage just keeps blasting, then the shammy is automatically doing lower dps. Intentionally nerfing the shaman's dps further just seems like overkill to me. <br />
<br />
Particularly since I'm sure then people would bitch at the shaman for having crap dps.<br />
<br />
And your hypothetical boss makes no sense anyways. If it affects healing, the offhealers would be affected too. And I'm not sure how the mechanic would not also affect other casters, so mages and warlocks would also be screwed. <br />
<br />
Besides which, apart from healing, there's no utility spells that are 100% unique anymore. You mention bloodlust... timewarp and ancient hysteria say hello. Hex, meet sheep and banish. Etc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Now that haste works so great for lowering GCD (by practically lower the cooldown on instant casts) every class wants crit and haste barring the few pieces of gear that allows bonus armor and spirit.<br />
<br />
The only reason some classes even consider the other stats is because of gimmicks/shoe-horned abilities (Killing Machine, Blood Craze, Renewing Mist, Lava Burst, etc).<br />
<br />
Why even shoe-horn multistrike into some classes without even providing a base amount to them? Why give multistrike to some classes with no reason to even gear for it?<br />
<br />
Well at least versatility isn't completely useless. Better than or &quot;equal&quot; to mastery for most specs.<br />
<br />
Minus the &quot;wear the same gear for healing or dps&quot;, they should've just went back to spell-power and attack power. Any weapon/accessory/trinket with strength or agility is a waste of item design/data space when it could've easily been attack power or nothing at all since weapon upgrades provide more weapon damage.<br />
<br />
Why did they even bother removing reforging and having tertiary stats when they could've easily just made all drops roll random secondary stats barring quest/named loot?<br />
<br />
Multistrike and Readiness could've been interesting stats, but they decided multistrike won't effect skill procs (unless shoe-horned) and Readiness was &quot;too good&quot;. Now Bonus Armor and Spirit are &quot;too good&quot; but it's ok because they're only on a few pieces of gear...<br />
<br />
And most importantly, why did they remove hit and exp but dual wield classes still face miss penalty when they already face an off-hand damage penalty? It's nice that Fury warriors' generator hits for less than weapon damage AND doesn't hit with both weapons, ontop of having pitiful rage gen from auto attacks because of a string of misses (and no baseline rage from damage taken anymore).<br />
<br />
They pushed the content out the door and made sure every class had one viable spec. They've so far showed no interest in making every spec is worth playing much less every stat worth investing in. Predefined specs have, and always will be a poor/uninteresting way to balance and design the game. Classes exist for this purposes already, to predefine a playstyle.<br />
<br />
Need to fire these class design/balance devs who put their fingers in their ears and cry fowl. They failed to keep classes withing a small margin much less even bother listening to feedback during beta. 1k-5k would be perfect-case, but we're looking at 10k+ which is worst-case.<br />
<br />
This expansion so far has been a &quot;status quo&quot; for their share holders and putting the game's stability on a back burner.</div></div><hr />

Sorry but theres no &quot;pure&quot; or &quot;hybrid&quot; + or -. That ended a long time ago, and i find it funny that you mentioned the less &quot;OP&quot; hybrids when comparing. Druid is the one thats really good atm, great in pvp, great in dps, so what?<br />
<br />
If they are hybrids or not doesn't mean it should be bad! If they are a healer, they want to play as healer, but if they want the chance to do good dps aswell, they go dps if they want to. Theres should NEVER be any + for choosing a &quot;pure&quot; dps, only the fact that the player likes to play the class and only wants to DPS and not have the other options.<br />

I just took a week off to farm the sh** out of it. A WEEK.<br />

Four hours, most of the time having to lead three dozen retards (and believe it or not, this is the very first time I use this word on the Internet!) raised in Pandaria, who think being more stubborn than a Core Hounds pack will make it surrender eventually.

Yep, that's their choice, lucky you had guild at start of expansion and got your place in raid. Atm every guild requirement is balance druid/lock/monk/healers. If i cant do top dps, why the hell would they pick new rogue?<br />
<br />
Yes, it's a whine, because it is a stupidly long way to get in raids for me(i hate LFR for it's stupidity, but from new week it will be a way to gear up a bit more). It's even make me want to stop playing once again.<br />
<br />
once again, there are pure class just because pure dps cant do anything else to get in raid, just dps, and if it is not one of the best, then it's useless.<br />

<br />
I get what you're saying, but the part where I struggle with the relevancy of a 'hybrid tax' is this: if an elemental shammy stops dpsing to off-heal, and the mage just keeps blasting, then the shammy is automatically doing lower dps. Intentionally nerfing the shaman's dps further just seems like overkill to me. <br />
<br />
Particularly since I'm sure then people would bitch at the shaman for having crap dps.<br />
<br />
And your hypothetical boss makes no sense anyways. If it affects healing, the offhealers would be affected too. And I'm not sure how the mechanic would not also affect other casters, so mages and warlocks would also be screwed. <br />
<br />
Besides which, apart from healing, there's no utility spells that are 100% unique anymore. You mention bloodlust... timewarp and ancient hysteria say hello. Hex, meet sheep and banish. Etc.<br />
<br />
The hypothetical boss is Thok. If it's called for that the shaman stop dpsing and heal then no one should say anything to him. I'd gamble smoke bomb is 100% unique, I can't think of any other class that can create a LoS and reduce damage taken but let's not nitpick.<br />

Sorry but theres no &quot;pure&quot; or &quot;hybrid&quot; + or -. That ended a long time ago, and i find it funny that you mentioned the less &quot;OP&quot; hybrids when comparing. Druid is the one thats really good atm, great in pvp, great in dps, so what?<br />
<br />
If they are hybrids or not doesn't mean it should be bad! If they are a healer, they want to play as healer, but if they want the chance to do good dps aswell, they go dps if they want to. Theres should NEVER be any + for choosing a &quot;pure&quot; dps, only the fact that the player likes to play the class and only wants to DPS and not have the other options.<br />
<br />
Wake up, this stupid thinking of yours is so old it shouldn't even be quoted tbh.<br />
<br />
I only used what first came to mind I didn't sit here and analyze what the best hybrid is, if you're sitting at your desk formulating responses then I guess I'm at a disadvantage. I don't think it's stupid that there is a difference in dps based on what else the class can do, what I do find stupid is your need to call other peoples opinions stupid though.</div></div><hr />

and this is why the game is like a roller coaster. ppl whine about the most stupid stuff. we are raiding highmaul normal and HC atm. We got alot of melees, and rogues.<br />
<br />
what this rogue has done wong is..gear and lvl up fast and get a raiding guild the sec he was lvl100 etc.. sadly this is how this game works! if u are behind.. then u'll be behind everyone :P<br />
<br />
if its hard foryou to see the facts imsaying, i feel sorry for u. as this is how the game works. and a hybrid should do just as much dmg as a &quot;pure&quot;. it should never be a bad thing to choose a class that can tank,heal etc and dps. This is a stupid way to look at things.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you know the bossfights, you should know why we shine... The fights where WW's really shine are Tectus, Brackenspore and Twins AKA CLEAVEFIGHTS!<br />
Monks are designed to shine on cleavefights so this shouldnt surprise anyone and I see no reason that it shouldnt be like this. <br />
Blizzards decision to make 3/7 fights in the first raid so perfect for us is not really the WW's being crazy OP but it definietly makes it look like it if people arent critical to the numbers/logs they see. <br />
Check out the remaining 4 bosses and you DONT see WW's being superior to other classes. Its sad that Blizzard decides to nerf us this early in the expansion. Yes we do well atm. and yes we kick everyones ass on some fights but people saying they do 15% more dmg than everyone else regardless of the fight... well... To me it says more about your fellow raiders than the WW class. <br />
Hunters and warlocks were way above everyone else for MONTHS during SoO. When 6.0 hit and hunters were lacking dmg, it took the community 2 days to whine enough so they were buffed up being in the top again. <br />
Now everyone else are whining about WW's being to OP... Finally people are playing this wonderfull class/spec because its actually usefull and competetive in progressraiding and they take this away after 1 week of raiding... <br />
<br />
Am I mad? Yes! But fingers crossed... Lets hope your (Blizzards) nerfs wont be to hard (like we have seen earlier).</div></div><hr />

&quot;Oh there are random rogue, DECLINE&quot;.<br />

There are is PURE and HYBRID, as pure dps class i cant get healing gear and get into raid atleast this way, i can just watch and cry. Or i can get into casual guild for green chat. Or i can reroll to hunter/monk or any other hybrid.<br />
<br />
Dont tell me that there are no difference long time ago, when you have no relations and guild, you can do nothing with this.<br />
<br />
As returning player that wanted to play dps class just once from 6 years tanking/healing its god damn disappointing to get in such place as a rogue.<br />
<br />
This is working as intended. I have 0 issues finding challenge modes because I link my achievement. You need to be in a guild, do them as a guild then use the premade finder when there are no guild mates online. As for hybrid/pure you guys need to stop living in the past, that shit is gone now. I main an enh shaman I don't have another spec because I refuse to heal or go ranged. If a guild forced me to go tank or heals I'd find a new guild.<br />

I have run it at least twice a day since it opened up. Only twice because it is three to four hours a run, and this is still denying myself any life for this one-time event outside of it, which is not how I usually like to play.<br />
Four hours, most of the time having to lead three dozen retards (and believe it or not, this is the very first time I use this word on the Internet!) raised in Pandaria, who think being more stubborn than a Core Hounds pack will make it surrender eventually. And decursing on Shazzrah with an 8 seconds cooldown when he throws 40 curses every, what, five seconds?<br />
I have barely seen two dozen Flames of Ragnaros, out of that many runs times 40 people! And clearly not *mine*! Not to mention half those who got it didn't even know what it was!<br />
<br />
WHAT IN THE NAME OF SANITY WERE YOU THINKING!?<br />
<br />
And of course *nothing* will be done beyond a useless comment saying &quot;we won't make the same mistakes next time&quot;. Which you will, because you just can't grasp that RNG drops are NOT a thing to put in a limited timeframe, or in anything where your own skill amounts for only 2.5% of the group! And it won't give anyone the flames they'll never had the sheer freaking random luck to get anyways...<br />
<br />
<br />
The only thing that drives me more batty than that stupid curse that is applied raid wide every few seconds is the constant stream of DPS screaming in raid and private tells to &quot;purge me noob&quot;. Nobody grasps the concept they nerfed remove curse to have an 8 second cool down. Even with all the healers doing it its hard to keep even the tanks and healers cleansed let alone anybody else until the fight is over. I understand they wanted to capture the feel of old MC but when you really change one of the tools needed to decurse things you should not bring back the raid wide curses again. Or if you do have them applied once in the fight and not constantly reapplied.</div></div><hr />

<br />
3: No flying in 6.1 is going to suck, it's may be okay for people who just want to stand in their garrison all day or people who haven't been 100 that long, but for the majority of us it's already grown tiresome/old. Blizzards approach to this seems to be similar to Labour's election campaign in the UK, they are adamant that their leader (Ed Miliband) isn't useless and the public just need to &quot;see the real Ed&quot; then they will be on side, we have seen him, we don't like him. Blizzard likewise seem adamant that we need to see all the cool things they have done and not be able to skip anything (thus making quests take more time) but once you have seen it 100 times it becomes tedious to have to see it again. I.E having to sit on the flightpath to near Highmaul because you have to ride afterwards is super boring, being able to fly there from your garrison would be quicker and simply better in every way.<br />
