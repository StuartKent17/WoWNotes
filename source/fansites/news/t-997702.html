<br />
Arms generally scales better with weapon damage than any other class.<br />
<br />
Not sure that Unholy buff is enough to keep it competitive with Frost. It's like 15% behind currently. This is like a 4% buff but Frost also scales much better with higher gear levels than Unholy does. Probably should be around 30% instead.<br />
<br />
I'd love to see a Might of the Frozen Wastes buff too to make 2H Frost viable again.</div></div><hr />

Could this push Unholy past Frost?<br />
Holy Priests making a comeback?<br />
BM needs major mechanic changes to pass MM<br />
Surv needs its scaling fixed to pass MM as well<br />

Because Blizzard has an awesome history of recognizing and acknowledging problems then doing something about them in a meaningful time span. Oh, and because this is also the last PTR build for 4.3.<br />

<br />
I've been waiting a long time to see some changes to Destruction. <br />
<br />
Granted, I wasn't looking for straight-up buffs; I was looking for a decrease in the number of abilities (many dots, handle it!) we needed to use to stay at the top of our game in PvE. (Except that sometimes it feels really neat to be watching 8 or 9 cooldowns/timers/buffs, on those rare nights when I'm at the top of my game. Other nights, not so much.) <br />
<br />
That, or heck, I'd trade all these buffs for Immolate protection. (I know, I know. Destro ain't the best for PvP -- but I'm not good enough to worry about playing the best. I just happen to really enjoy playing Destruction in PvP, except against certain arena comps where immolate is dispelled in that short time before the server acknowledges immolate is up and I can conflag. I can add more dots for protection, but the healer can dispel them at the same rate, and all while running or LoSing.)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Arms generally scales better with weapon damage than any other class.<br />
<br />
Not sure that Unholy buff is enough to keep it competitive with Frost. It's like 15% behind currently. This is like a 4% buff but Frost also scales much better with higher gear levels than Unholy does. Probably should be around 30% instead.<br />
<br />
I'd love to see a Might of the Frozen Wastes buff too to make 2H Frost viable again.<br />
<br />
Not sure what kind of info you're getting this from, but frost does not sim THAT much better than unholy in current BiS gear. Parses will obviously be higher due to the vast majority of high end DK's being frost, but the gap is not as huge as you're making it seem.</div></div><hr />

It was bound to happen-we scale ridiculously well with gear. They did the same thing between 4.1-4.2, and after I got loaded with Firelands gear and FL weapons/4pc, I'm sitting well near the top of the charts. Between 4.1-4.2 they lowered the damage boost from 10%-5%, I knew they'd do exactly this. It's really not going to affect us once we start getting loaded up with the new tier of gear really-hell, it didn't really hurt us too much even the first time.</div></div><hr />

Christ, Arcane will still be top DPS on single target since Fire still is too RNG. However, this makes Fire viable on Single Target dps and we can focus on reforging to crit/haste instead of going all out on mastery.

<br />
To add to this and someone asking if frost should have been buffed over fire -- no, frost is competitive. You only see it rarely because arcane edges it out. If arcane gets even slightly nerfed, frost will be the go-to spec. These buffs for fire are great and much needed; it should land fire somewhere between arcane and frost. This could make fire the spec for mobile encounters, and it will likely allow those who prefer fire over arcane to still be able to play that way and remain competitive.</div></div><hr />

how is ret a middle ground? it sucks balls, that's why they're buffing all ret dps by 5% and doubling judgement damage (and nerfing HOW damage, yay. why not just remove this skill and roll the damage into other abilities, it causes nothing but balance issues.)</div></div><hr />

I thought i was never gonna complain about nerfs or buffs, but a buff to frenzied regen was not necessary at all for pvp.<br />
If there is one class that needs a buff to self healing or self defense, especially for pvp, it is hunter. And this is coming from a rogue.<br />

ESP when its bottom dps specs getting buffed and they happen to be, I dunno, MOONKIN and SP :P. Dunno how good these changes are going to be, but they are in the right direction. Also PVP? While I enjoy it, it should always come second to PVE. I've always thought that they should have an Arena Tournament Realm up all the time, and do the PVP ladder on that. That way, everyone would have the same gear, and they could tweak classes to be more balanced than on live servers. After all, PVP should be about a team's skill rather than they happened to get gear faster or play an OP comp?. They will never get every spec being balanced in both PVE and PVP while being totally different from one another.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You *are* aware that Firemage is currently the worse spec in the game? It is around 5000-6000 dps below Arcane. Currently mages are FORCED<br />
into playing arcane, no matter if they like it or not - and made fun of of their &quot;one button spec&quot;. When I recently forgot to respec (I had tried out something with fire before) and got an invite to a random raid I heard a voice on TS in total disbelief &quot;You are a firemage????&quot; I hurried to say &quot;Ah, just forgot to change spec before the raid&quot;. Mages currently play fire for exactly ONE encounter (which is of an extremely gimmicky nature - flying with Alysrazor, there you use Firespec with Arcane gear - everything else you HAVE to play Arcane (Frost works also for some I heard, but not Fire).<br />
<br />
I *also* once tried to play Fire in Firelands (the irony!!!) as we had no warlock in our 10-man. It turned out I lost more personal dps due to the respec from Arcane to<br />
fire than all 3 casters GAINED through the Scorch-Debuff added together...<br />

Blizz, you really must be kidding me with the Mage buffs, I mean really? How many people out there really enjoy using one hand and one finger to play this game anyway.. pls cast a vote if you play a mage and think one hand and one finger is too hard for you... :confused:<br />
<br />
And this actually is the point. Many Mageplayers do not want to play a 2-button-spec (arcane) anymore. But they are forced to do this as Fire currently is not raid-viable. This buff fixes it (hopefully) and they can then play a non-2-button-spec again.</div></div><hr />

Actually fire mage dps is even worse than BM hunter , even with the legendary staff ( no need to say that it is worse than destruction warlock too ).So yes fire mage definitely needs a buff</div></div><hr />

Well the fire mage stuff is rediculous, instead of fixing the ignite bug thier just buffing the base damage. All the people QQing though, its arcane that needs the nerf, fire is just totally screwed, hence hardly anyone uses it anymore. All fire is good for atm is flying on alyzrazor, this will hopefully make it viable again as a 2button spec is just totally boring.<br />
<br />
-Hunter-<br />
Thats a BM buff, 5% AP still wont make BH anygood for pve... so rather pointless really. Its just going to make hunters even more op in pvp, yet again, blizzard fixing a PvE balence issue by breaking a pvp issue. Hoping to see more hunter changes soon, they cant just leave it at that.<br />
<br />
Priest vs druid, theyve just done a role reversal, priests are going to be leading the way for healing now i guess, and druids will just lack healing.. not much point in that either. And it looks like they are using thier imagination yet again, pallys get a glyphed prayer of healing... Woot?</div></div><hr />

Actually, VERY needed. <br />
<br />
Fire mages are completely useless in PvE right now. The mages you see in PvE tearing up meters are Arcane mages.<br />

if you take arcane out of the equation (pls blizzard) mages are the worst caster class in the game atm. Destro is by far the worst lock spec. the lock/mage haters are probably all spriests and boomkins (the guy who said that they needed &quot;balance&quot; made me laugh) probably meant nerfing them as they op atm, unless you are bad at it. i'm glad they are buffing unholy, its the only &quot;true&quot; dk spec, nerf the fan boy frost dks. i think the demonology changes are a little op given the dps i've seen so far, its a direct buff to thier strongest attacks, boosting their boosted if you like. although the soulfire buff is correct.<br />
<br />
&quot;pvp ignored again&quot; - you do actually realise that pvp is just a part of the same game? i mean its not a completely separate entity. personally dislike ppl who call themselves &quot;pvpers&quot;, may aswell call themselves &quot;half the gamers&quot; fail qq. PVP is a part of WoW, and however you like it, WoW is predominatnly a PvE MMORPG, if you hate it go play quake or just enjoy it as i do.</div></div><hr />

Wait what kind of Balancing? Boomkin's are currently 2nd highest dps overall in raids.

Actually if ur smart enoh to use a crab or other tenacity pet you would know that by using laststand and intervenen on urself provides around 80k+ personal shield on top of RoS which makes u unable to be crit and if you pick up the raptor strike glyph you have a pretty well rounded defense its just not as faceroll as, bearform-&gt; survivalinstincts-&gt; enrage-&gt; frenzied regeneration, thats why i would tell anyone in the game hunters have an extremely high skill-cap and aren't for derp ppl that dont explore their own class enough to know its full potential and simply say &quot;oh [insert class here] killed me this class sucks i want a buff so i can one shot it.&quot;</div></div><hr />

Lol at you. Idiot of the day. Plays a rogue and thinks that a buff to destro will somehow make the already melee-dominated affliction lock more &quot;OP&quot;.<br />
