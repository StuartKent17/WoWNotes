Demon Blades now is 100% chance to proc. So now every auto attack will generate fury no matter what. Should be fine to reduce the ring proc for DB.</div></div><hr />

I'm guessing that the two will balance out for ST, nerfing us for AE but leaving us with less dependence on FoF. Hoping that there's tuning passes made later for actual buffs.</div></div><hr />

So +2000Str became a + 4% buff to Str<br />
<br />
At 30 000 Str ---- +1200 Str was +2000Str<br />
At 40 000 Str ---- +1600 Str was +2000Str<br />
At 50 000 Str ---- +2000 Str was +2000Str<br />
<br />
So the less strong get nerfed ?<br />

It's a rearrangement, tbf. SLight AE nerf, ST stays about the same, just isn't as reliant on FoF. We need buffs for ST, though, so hoping for this to be a precursor to buffs...</div></div><hr />

They're probably just throwing Demon Hunters a bone because there's a very large chance we won't ever see any more Warglaives added to the game just for the simple fact that Demon Hunter's are the only ones that can equip them. I'm imagining in their opinion it's like.. &quot;Why waste Resources making more Warglaives? They can equip Daggers/1h Swords/1h Axes and Fists.

Frost will still be fine, people are over reacting in my opinion.

Queing random would have gotten quite a bit of interest, but needing a premade group just sort of... meh.<br />
<br />
I fully understand that. The best option would probably be a LFR + Normal mode difficulty (or, well, all 4 but that would take way to much time for an event that is there for 1 week every 3 months).</div></div><hr />

One can only hope! down with RNG without protection on old school mounts!</div></div><hr />

Also, it really would be nice if blizz gave frost strike the same treatment as with death coil, right now everyone is using breath because frost strikes conversion of runic power into damage is that much weaker (considering that it takes a global cooldown to use 25 rp, while with breath you just spam obliterate away).</div></div><hr />

Is it now time to let the other classes have access to the other legendary mogs like thunderfury and shadowmourne?<br />
<br />
Rogues have Thunderfury already. It looks like they will slowly find ways to add more eventually, at least I hope that is the case.</div></div><hr />

Bodyguards now gain significantly more XP from player quests.&quot;<br />
<br />
Is a lie: still 150xp per quest.</div></div><hr />

What people *want want want* has effectively ruined this game. I hope they realise this one day and stop pandering to whiners, in favour of making good games.</div></div><hr />

And then there is this... just premades really cuts down on the participation options. Of course, they could merely be testing it out this round.</div></div><hr />
