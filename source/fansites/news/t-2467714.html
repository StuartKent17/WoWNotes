Patch 8.1 Hotfixes - February 14, 2019<br />
Dungeons and Raids<br />
<br />
Battle of Dazar’alor<br />
<br />
High Tinker Mekkatorque<br />
<br />
Wind Up now grants 10% Haste and Movement Speed in Heroic difficulty (was 20%).<br />
Boss health lowered by 5% in Heroic difficulty.<br />
<br />
King Rastakhan<br />
<br />
Seal of Purification, Scorching Detonation, and Withering Burst should no longer hit pets.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Uldir<br />
<br />
Taloc<br />
<br />
Orbs of Harmony will now respawn when the Taloc encounter resets.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Player versus Player<br />
<br />
Restoration Druid mana regeneration is now reduced by 55% in PvP.<br />
Holy Priest, Holy Paladin, Restoration Shaman, and Mistweaver Monk mana regeneration is now reduced by 50% in PvP.<br />
Discipline Priest mana regeneration is now reduced by 45% in PvP.<br />
Balance Druid, Feral Druid, and Elemental Shaman mana regeneration is reduced by 35% in PvP.<br />
<br />
Developers’ notes: We’ve taken a careful look at healer mana during longer PvP engagements in both Arenas and battlegrounds, and the changes above are intended to address several concerns. In PvP, we want mana to feel like a more critical resource, and we want mana efficiency to be an important part of PvP healing. At the beginning of Battle for Azeroth, mana regeneration from all healer specs was reduced by 15-30% (depending on the class), and after reviewing the current state of the game, we feel like further reductions are necessary to both healer specs and a few hybrid specs.<br />

Whirling Dragon Punch Bug<br />
are you guys aware about the whirling dragon punch bug for windwalkers? I haven’t read anything acknowledging it and its pretty game influencing<br />
With Whirling Dragon Punch, there seems to be a bug causing a cooldown discrepancy. We’re testing it in 8.1.5, where it appears to be fixed, and appreciate the heads-up.

<br />
What if I told you that companies were made out of human beings? <br />
<br />
What if I told you that most gamedevs are the opposite of cash-grabbing opportunists, often taking pay cuts to work on the project they love?<br />
<br />
Would that change your mind? Probably not, as most gamers have no idea how hard it is to maintain a profit in this industry.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Blizzard is not your friend, neither are their investors. But the game devs are not just doing it for money. As I said in a different posts, game devs are not like your normal developer. They endure a lot more stress, lower pay and more insecurity than a standard developer, because they love games.</div></div><hr />

The guy has made some choices that I simply respect, and his work has more often than not been solid. <br />
<br />
With that being said, I'm having a real hard time not looking at Acti-Blizz through exclusively cynical glasses. Blizzard's values might be the same as always at the core, but values count for precious little when one's actions doesn't back them up. What I am seeing, and have been seeing for some time now, is a company losing touch with its own legacy and community. As much as I'd love to simply offer good faith and trust that things will turn around, I need some sort of sign for that to happen. Chris Metzen won't cut it this time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
He is mostly talking about the people working for the company. There are lots of ways to get paid. It took these people a lot of effort over the course of their lives to get where they are in the industry and i'm sure like most creative people, they care about what people think about the fruits of their labour. I would expect many of them could find better paid employment where they don't have to deal with the darker aspects of an online &quot;community&quot; judging and criticising every single thing they do or say.<br />

Chris Metzen: Warlords of Draenor was his baby. Now he's retired. Let that sink in.<br />
<br />
Nah, he was neck deep in Titan during WOD - WOD was the rise of Ion, Afrasiabi and Kosak, more than Metzen. He might have done big brush type stuff, but the last expansion with his fingerprints and spirit all over it was Pandaria. That was the last expansion he was creative director for, Afrasiabi took over that job in WOD.</div></div><hr />

No.<br />
<br />
If they wanted the support and love of the community they would act like it. Like Blizzard did in years past.<br />

No, they don't care, time and again they prove it and reconfirm it. They care about revenue graphs on the inside meetings weekly presentations. <br />

They give their ALL daily...... for YOU guys.<br />
<br />
Something about this kind of rubs me the wrong way. Were those who were let go any less dedicated and passionate than those who were kept? Were they giving less? Weren't developers left untouched?<br />
<br />
It's not like you can even point to a chart which says Activision Blizzard is tanking financially so steps had to be made in order to meet expectations especially when they exceeded expectations. Their CEO Bobby Kotick makes something like 29 million dollars a year and sits on nearly 7 billion dollars but sure they have to restructure from the bottom in order to... make more than they've ever made before.<br />
<br />
It's kind of perplexing but I guess it isn't due to shareholders and the idea that a rough patch is taken as some kind of death knell where the higher ups will have to downgrade their private jets and own 13 mansions instead of 15.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anyone who wanted him to get fired were complete morons then, I think you are thinking of Ghostcrawler. Christ Metzen is the one reason there is a story behind any of Blizzards game, he is the creative genius behind starcraft and warcraft story, not too sure about diablo, that may have been someone else. <br />
<br />
And I'll support the team when they grow a backbone and say no we can't do it that way. What are they going to do, fire the entire wow department, ya good luck with that.</div></div><hr />

No, it is not. It is patronizing, it is arrogant. And it is not his place to tell anyone what to think, say or let alone feel.

If you have 5 doctors and 0 tax keepers<br />
and because of less patients coming in you now only need 3 doctors...<br />
are you suddenly going to get those 2 doctors and force them into tax keeping jobs? are you going to spend months training them into something they prob wont even like?<br />
or are you going to lay off those 2 doctors, and hire the tax keepers you need?<br />

This is the first time in 23 years I do not have a Blizzard Game to play. I would bounce around between Overwatch, WoW, Diablo, HotS.... Yes it seems this company is in trouble as there is no product the Blizzard community is engaged in (IMO). I can't believe I am playing ESO now for MMO, Apex Legends for Team Based Shooter, etc. I have been waiting for a new Blizzard game for so long but nothing has been developed.<br />
<br />
remember back when blizz went almost half a decade without releasing anything new? <br />

All I see is him asking the community to support the company the same way they ask the employees to be grateful for working for an esteemed name with low wages. I've been in one of those big names, they want you to feel grateful you work for them. Chris is asking for fan loyalty, he is trying to recruit the love for Blizzard. If the company management wanted fan loyalty, which includes &quot;people not being dicks to them&quot;, or they were concerned with the &quot;love for Blizzard&quot; they would act to earn it, just like Blizzard of the past did.<br />
<br />
And if any developer or designer in Blizzard has their feelings hurt by the backlash of the fans they should consider who they are working for. <br />
<br />
Blizzard/Activision earn what they get. But hey, many people are trashing at the food at McDonalds and many people are trashing about other companies, that doesn't stop them from being prosperous. Such as EA. <br />
<br />
So spare your melodramatic sentiments. If you have a problem with the backlash against them maybe look into what's causing it.<br />
<br />
Raging against a company that pays enormous sums to non-gamer non-developer glorified positions, some of the highest in the world, which declares huge profits and then lays off hundreds of people is justified. Recruit corporate love somewhere else.</div></div><hr />

Exactly. I mean if you want a game where the dev team gives a damn then FF14. Other honorable mentions would be Warframe, ESO and GW2. <br />
<br />
The way they've acted as of late they deserve what they get in terms of community reaction. Lack of clarity on BFA features/systems, announcing a mobile phone game to a dedicated PC (and possibly console) audience, Ion trying to paint himself as the victim in recent interviews and god knows what else.<br />
<br />
The devs clearly don't care about an enjoyable experience anymore. Just how much they can keep that MAU metric up.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, seems like nobody's believing it though. WoW devs have lost too much player trust from WoD onwards, BfA was another huge step down again. Actions speak louder than words. Unless they are giving the players a stable delivery of polished content the next one or two years down the line nothing they say will do any good. <br />

Yeah the dev team just does not deserve any respect or good grace anymore imo. They've wasted whatever chances they had with me personally. They were on the right track in Legion and just nosedived with BFA.<br />
<br />
They clearly do not care about their community anymore. The Q and As show it. Literally addresses nothing important, wastes an hour or so of time telling us shit we already know and so on.<br />

As I said if you want a dev team that gives a damn, communicates with it's players and actually cares about making first and foremost an enjoyable game experience then I'd try the 4 games I listed above.</div></div><hr />

I don't want them to fail miserably but yeah agree on supporting. They are not the Blizzard that had that passion with games like Broodwar anymore. <br />
<br />
I mean I wish Blizzard and hell even Activision would wake up and smell the coffee but it's unlikely and in the future this will just come back to bite them. Not in like a year or two but a long way down the road it will.<br />
<br />
Hence why my money's gone to Zenimax and Square for a monthly sub these days. Far better value and a more enjoyable experience. And if anyone is looking for a new MMO right now I'd highly recommend FF14 and ESO. :)</div></div><hr />

Maybe, but we don't know and don't have conclusive information that points out that he said that the way some people put it, remember that Lore called Dickbags to people on a political discussion about EEUU on his personal twitter account, and wow players were all over him because they thought he was calling them that.<br />
