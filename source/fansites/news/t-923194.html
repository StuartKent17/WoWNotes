General<br />
<br />
Steadfast raiders have an opportunity to embark on a series of quests to create an all-new legendary caster staff. In order to begin the process of assembling the staff, players must first kill a Molten Lord in the Firelands. Once a Molten Lord is killed, players can accept the quest A Legendary Engagement from Ziradormi in Grommash Hold in Orgrimmar, or Coridormi atop the Wizard's Sanctum in Stormwind. The legendary item questline is only available to druids, mages, priests, shaman, and warlocks.<br />
<br />
<br />
Currency<br />
Conquest &amp; Honor Points<br />
<br />
Example: During the first week of Season 10 everyone starts with a rating below 1500. Therefore, the cap from Rated Battlegrounds will be 1500 and the cap from Arena rating will be 1000. In the first week, the character wins enough Arena matches to reach the 1000 point cap. After that point, Arena wins will no longer grant Conquest points for the week. However, the character can still earn up to 500 additional points, but can only earn those points from either Rated Battlegrounds, or from the Conquest Point bonus for holiday and/or daily random Battlegrounds. The following week the cap will be recalculated based on the character's ratings, and it is possible Arena rating could now generate the higher cap. The second week, the character's cap from Arena rating is 1600, and the cap from Rated Battlegrounds is 1500. The character has a total cap of 1600 Conquest points for the week. Up to 1500 points can be earned from Rated Battlegrounds, but the last 100 must come from a different source.<br />
<br />
<br />
Valor &amp; Justice Points<br />
<br />
The number of Valor Points awarded for killing a boss in the Firelands is 70 120 in 10-player mode, and 90 140 in 25-player mode.<br />
The number of Valor Points awarded for killing Occu'thar in Baradin Hold is 35 120 in 10-player mode, and 45 140 in 25-player mode.</div></div><hr />

theres no mention of a lower cap for non raiders<br />
<br />
even in 4.2 u could if they didnt lower the cap to 980<br />
<br />
980 from randoms +120/140 from bh which totals 1100/1120 avalible to non raiders of firelands<br />
<br />

Oh I know they did, I was quite annoyed by the huge amounts of QQ about not getting capped with raids and heroics getting you capped. That still hasn't changed, heroics will still get you capped.

Well true, yes, but getting capped for doing 25 mans but not getting capped for doing 10 mans? They should of just left the system how it was and always has been if they want 10/25 man to be different, 10s give lower loot and 25s give better loot, was a better system anyway.(imo)</div></div><hr />

There was no way not to on this one. The change was just flat out illogical and did to raiders exactly what they've been doing to small group and solo players, force them into content they dislike for their gearing progression.<br />
<br />
<br />
This was a bit of a battle on the forums for this one, I've also been told that some IMs and emails were recieved from &quot;top guild&quot; leadership to some specific devs over it. Those are just rumors, but think about what Paragon said about how brutal tier 11 was on them. Adding a requirement to grind off 5 mans just makes the problem worse.</div></div><hr />

I don't think the problem was heroics getting you capped, it was raids not getting you capped. This has been fixed or, in the case of 10 mans, much improved at least.</div></div><hr />

Non-raiders AND MOST OF MY ALTS will get capped by doing random heroics (if I feel like doing them with all of my alts..!).<br />
Raiders will still get more loot and improve gear.<br />
Non-raiders and my alts will get what they can in order to feel like improving the gear and having fun with the characters as well.<br />

<br />
The advantage raiders have is the act of raiding and the gear the bosses drop. VP is just extra for everyone.</div></div><hr />

Uhm.. Since there is 2,5 times more people in the raid, I only see it fair that there drop 2,5 times as much loot (2*2,5 = 5).<br />
The only point where you could say &quot;unfair&quot; is that 25 man has 3 Tier tokens drop instead of 2,5 tokens which it should be, but hey.. Pretty much all the 25s are harder than 10mans anyway - atm.</div></div><hr />

Originally, badges were 5-man heroic only, but the gear was lower quality than raid gear. When it became raid quality, raids because an equal method of acquisition. <br />
<br />
Still, T11 was the first time you didn't need to do 5-mans to maximize your acquisition... that was honestly the real mistake. There's no way they'll ever be able to bring it back without people crying like they did this time. Still, given how many of the raiders had admitted they fully intended to be jerks and asses in the LFD as a result of this change, we all knew that they fully intended to make as many people miserable as possible if they didn't get their way.... better to just let them go do their own thing so the people who actually like doing 5-mans aren't punished by forced association. I'd like to think it's that line of reasoning that led to the change.</div></div><hr />

How the heck is 2 drops per 10 man any less than 5 drops per 25? <br />
<br />
2/10 = 5/25 = 1/5 - or did you miss first grade maths?<br />
<br />
So how is it easier for 25-mans to gear? Well it isn't.<br />
<br />
It is a hell of a lot harder to organize and maintain 25-mans though, and it needs some incentive to help guilds provide a type of content that a lot of us players prefer.</div></div><hr />

It's not about that I guess.<br />
It's 2 pieces against 5 pieces of the same loot table. The chance that the piece you need drops is much higer.<br />
Say if a boss drops 10 different items, in a 10-man raid you will see it 20% of the time and in a 25-man raid you will see it 50% of the time.<br />
<br />
In the case everyone's geared and most of the loot is disenchanted, you can even find full epic raiders with one blue piece missing (like me) because of the (increased) loot RNG in 10-man raids.<br />
<br />
Edit: And that blue piece drops from ****ing Magmaw, the first boss we downed and the one I've killed more times. So..</div></div><hr />

<br />
Exactly. Same here - 18 Magmaw kills and still no bracers :mad: It's just much easier for 25 mans to gear up simply because there's more chance for useful gear to drop for the larger raid composition. With only 7 available bosses in firelands and loot tables being so big, it's going to be even worse for 10 man's. It's stupid that the gear is so RNG such that even at the beginning of cata, on almost every kill we were disenchanting something.<br />
<br />
Would it really be so difficult to perform a very simple, tiny raid composition check?</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's not really true after the first week. If you're good at Arena and get a higher rating, your Arena cap will actually be higher than your RBG cap. It's really designed to reduce the &quot;farm cap with 0 rating teams&quot; effect of the previous season, which has a tendency to really depress new entrants to arena when they get roflstomped ten games in a row.</div></div><hr />

A lot of the end-tier bosses have been made arguably easier with the nerfs on 10-man. Al'Akir was always incomparably easier and the removal of a whole add on Cho'gall and the tank wrack on Sinestra made the only other challenges rather dwindling. As for Nefarian, that may or may not be harder on ten, but I think more so that it's easier just with the constraint of a tight setup requirement for kicking.</div></div><hr />

<br />
People are not reading the entire paragraph:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The following week the cap will be recalculated based on the character's ratings, and it is possible Arena rating could now generate the higher cap. The second week, the character's cap from Arena rating is 1600, and the cap from Rated Battlegrounds is 1500. The character has a total cap of 1600 Conquest points for the week. Up to 1500 points can be earned from Rated Battlegrounds, but the last 100 must come from a different source<br />
<br />
<br />
Yes, the first week of the season you can only cap with a couple RBG wins. But after that? It depends on how good you actually are at arena.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Clearly, 10/2 = 5, 25/5 = 5 Oh 25's have so much more loot per member.<br />
<br />
Yes, of course mathematically the loot per member is the same, but the chance for specific loot to drop is, onbviously, higher (though your chance to win it over your guildies is smaller, of course, but in due time this is no longer the case as your guildies will already have it and 5 drops is still 5 drops). For example, we went weeks and weeks and weeks without seeing the plate boots from I believe Chimaeron (being a 10man guild), but again and again the Galoshes which all our clothies who wanted it already had, on bóth normal and heroic mode, so that was twice the same disaster for 3 platies. That's a lot of bad luck right there.<br />
<br />
I personally don't care, we have a lot of fun and I'd run 10s anyday over 25s (and that's while I always was a big fan of the bigger the raid, the better), with an amazing guild and nor loot or VP will stop us at this point. <br />
<br />
I do agree however that it makes no sense at this point to give more VP to 25s. What kind of an incentive is that? Any decent guild was drowning in VP halfway through their progress, 10 ór 25. People ask every week if &quot;any alt needs some VP boots maybe, I'm capped again&quot;-- it just makes 10man VP gain a bit slower at first. Not to mention 10man is no longer the joke it used to be, quite the contrary even in this expansion. In many cases 10man (heroic) was simply a lot harder, not in the first place because you needed such specific classes to be able to do what anyone can in 25s or specific gear requirements, but also because the majority of fights is simply a lot better suited for 25s (like Sinestra), and where 10man just feels unnecessarily annoying and rough to handle. That for me doesn't make it any less fun but it does completely defy the point of needing any kind of additional incentive to do 25s, this difficulty difference alone, if they retain it in Firelands, should be plenty. Not to mention a lot of people still prefer 25s and wouldn't run 10s if their life depended on it. I am convinced a few more VP won't swing the favor to any direction of either 10s or 25s. Pugs still do mostly 10 mans (I can't recall any 25 man pug recently!), less VP or not. Did you ever see someone go &quot;oh no I'll do 25 because I'll get 60 more VP for the 3 bosses this pug may down?&quot; come on.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Al'akir, Ascendant Council, Cho'gall and Sinestra (all heroic), the most challenging 25man encounters, are all easier on 10man after the nerfs. Any 25man guild, not in top 100 world, will always have it easier on 10man too, since most 25man guilds carry a lot of people who are performing subpar (maybe 5-12 people each raid), so by bringing the best raiders for a 10man raid, they wil basically kill new bosses much much faster. This is also why (on my server where a lot of guilds have killed 13/13), I saw a lot of decent 25man guilds go down and went 10man instead around the time the nerfs for 10man happened.</div></div><hr />

amount of random loot per member is same but chance of getting the correct loot even once is much higher. <br />
<br />
if you kill 10 times boss:<br />
<br />
in 10 man 2x10=20 loots so even with 5% chance you'll get atleast once that loot.<br />

<br />
The advantage there is offset by the fact that you can get up to at least 3 of the same item at once (I have never seen more than 3 at once so I think that is the cap but correct me if I am wrong). I am sure that if someone who understands statistical math a lot better than I do ran the numbers, 25s still have a slightly higher chance to get a particular item, but in the real world I have a toon that I run in a 25-man and an alt that I run through 10s. Both geared up at about the same pace. The loot advantage is not as great as people think it is.<br />
<br />
As for the VP change, it seems to me that the only complaint that has been addressed is the ability to cap VPs by raiding Firelands alone. T11 raids are still worth next to nothing, and someone running only heroics can still hit cap without setting foot in a raid. I wonder if Blizzard intended this to be the way it worked the entire time? As in, they knew they had a change that was gonna make people storm the forums. So they announce an even more drastic change, wait for the angry mob to arrive, then toss them a cookie by implementing the original change they wanted that, in comparison, doesn't seem that bad. The angry mob goes away because it thinks got what it wanted, and Blizzard gets to implement the changes they wanted to do in the first place without all that much fuss.</div></div><hr />

Ghostcrawler has always been a weak designer, but without oversight, all the designers (most of them junior and new to WoW) are really botching things on a regular basis.

It's 2 pieces against 5 pieces of the same loot table. The chance that the piece you need drops is much higer.<br />
Say if a boss drops 10 different items, in a 10-man raid you will see it 20% of the time and in a 25-man raid you will see it 50% of the time.<br />
<br />
In the case everyone's geared and most of the loot is disenchanted, you can even find full epic raiders with one blue piece missing (like me) because of the (increased) loot RNG in 10-man raids.<br />
<br />
Edit: And that blue piece drops from ****ing Magmaw, the first boss we downed and the one I've killed more times. So..<br />
<br />
You haven't accounted for competition in the 25-man group that is not as likely to exist in the 10-man group (or at least not to the same severity unless you have an incredibly unfortunate raidcomp). If you're a resto druid and the only one in the group for both sizes, then, yes, your analisys holds true. However, if you have a lone plate dps (warrior) in the 10-man group, but the 25-man group has two additional ones (dk and pal, assuming both want the item as well), then the likelihood that the warrior gets the piece he's looking for is actually less than the 10-man version for any given fight (50% divided by 3 is oftentimes less than 20%).<br />
<br />
Where your argument might really win out, though, is when you show the effects of compounding (i.e. taking history into account). Using our plate dps example, as I just said the odds that the warrior snags the item is less than that of running the 10-man. However, after, say, the deathknight wins the first one, the warrior's competition is reduced and his odds go up to 25%. If the paladin wins the next one then his odds return to 50%. So doesn't that seem faster? Let's examine the time frames in which this could happen, on average, with the two modes to find out.<br />
<br />
For 10-man, a 20% drop rate means 1 drop per 5 raids on average, thereby fully equipping our plate dps roster (only 1 warrior) with the item around the 5 week mark on average. For 25-man, a 50% drop rate means 1 drop per 2 raids on average, thereby equipping our plate dps roster (3 people) with the item around the 6 week mark on average.... wait, what? It takes longer?!?!?!<br />
<br />
Of course it does. Relative to the different sizes of the raid group the plate dps composition is skewed high for the 25-man group (3 divided by 1 is not equal to 25 divided by 10). So lets look at it in terms of a more straightforward comparison. 2 cloth dps for the 10-man group compared to 5 cloth dps for the 25 man group. The 10-man group will take around 10 weeks (5 weeks times 2 people) on average to get both of the dps the piece and so will the 25-man group (2 weeks times 5 people). In other words, they're running at the same rate assuming they're running with comparable compositions.<br />
<br />
Just to double check, lets run the numbers of our cloth dps example through the general binomial probability equation (look up binomial probability on wikipedia) to see if the likelihoods pan out as equal over the course of 10 weeks.<br />
<br />
p = probability the item drops (10: 0.2 | 25: 0.5)<br />
q = probability the item doesn't drop (10: 0.8 | 25: 0.5)<br />
n = number of raids (10 weeks)<br />
k = times we need the item to drop (10: 2-10 | 25: 5-10 ... need to run the equation for each number of possible outcomes and add the results together)<br />
<br />
% = SUM((n! / (x! * (n - x)!)) * (p^x) * (q^(n-x)) | x: k..n)<br />
<br />
10-man = 0.6241902592<br />
25-man = 0.6220703125<br />
<br />
Woah! In 10 weeks you're actually slightly more likely to gear your full roster in 10-man than in 25-man! If we see what 11 weeks looks like, then the 25-man scenario starts to take the probabilistic lead, though not by much.<br />
<br />
10-man = 0.67787743232<br />
25-man = 0.72509765625<br />
<br />
Keep in mind though that this is assuming a proportionate raid comp and that everyone capable of using a particular item actually wants the item. Both of these variables affect how many times we need the item to drop. Also note that the perspective of this math focuses on getting &quot;everyone&quot; in the raid geared up rather than any one particular individual. <br />
<br />
If you're pugging content, you can't really rely on a somewhat static raid comp and would therefore have to look at each raid individually and determine ahead of time a couple of break-off points in terms of competition you're willing to live with in order to maximize your odds for any given raid. As a rule of thumb, if you're looking at competition less than some proportion of 2.5 than you might expect from the other raid format, then stick around as your chances are higher (assuming you can down the boss). If you're seeing competition significantly higher than that 2.5 proportion, then you may want to consider leaving and finding a different pug to run with... you have 7 days in order to find a favorable pug composition and it doesn't really matter much if you do it in 10 or 25 man. as the above math shows.<br />
<br />
If you're not pugging, and you instead find yourself in an incredibly unfortunate raid composition you may want to consider re-rolling a different class that doesn't give you as much competition, convincing someone else to do that, or /gquit and find a more opportune guild. Otherwise you (and your raid leader) are just going to have to be content with having more shards than upgrades early on, and thereby potentially slower progression.<br />
<br />
TL;DR: In the end it all boils down to the raid comp. Drop rates are fine.</div></div><hr />

I am sure that if someone who understands statistical math a lot better than I do ran the numbers, 25s still have a slightly higher chance to get a particular item, but in the real world I have a toon that I run in a 25-man and an alt that I run through 10s. Both geared up at about the same pace. The loot advantage is not as great as people think it is.<br />
<br />
As for the VP change, it seems to me that the only complaint that has been addressed is the ability to cap VPs by raiding Firelands alone. T11 raids are still worth next to nothing, and someone running only heroics can still hit cap without setting foot in a raid. I wonder if Blizzard intended this to be the way it worked the entire time? As in, they knew they had a change that was gonna make people storm the forums. So they announce an even more drastic change, wait for the angry mob to arrive, then toss them a cookie by implementing the original change they wanted that, in comparison, doesn't seem that bad. The angry mob goes away because it thinks got what it wanted, and Blizzard gets to implement the changes they wanted to do in the first place without all that much fuss.<br />
You apparently never did a raid where 1/2 the gear was DEed due to not having any class in the raid that could use the items. Sure if you can manage to set up your 10 man with:<br />
1 Shadow priest, 1 mage, 1 warlock, 1 rogue, 1 restro druid, 1 restro shaman, 1 hunter, 1 holy paladin, 1 blood DK, 1 prot warrior<br />
then you may not have any gear DEed that someone doesn't already have, but for the rest of us, it isn't reasonable.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hmm, I was unaware of this. If it's possible to get all the same loot for a given drop then this changes the probabilities of the equations I used above to be slightly lower than 20% and 50%. We use the same binomial probability equation to find that for 10-man the probability of seeing at least 1 of what you want is actually 18%, and in 25-man it's 40.95%. Therefore the 10 week results look like this:<br />
<br />
10-man: 0.560836742222<br />
25-man: 0.390767903545<br />
<br />
This is a clear winner for running 10-man content! The probabilities don't come close to panning out even until the 14 week mark:<br /> 
<br />
10-man: 0.746879949849<br />
25-man: 0.744681435732<br />
<br />
After 14 weeks, 25-man starts leading the probability race, but we're already looking at significantly high probabilities in these time frames (~80%+), so you'd be insane not to run 10-man content just for the loot drops.<br />
<br />
The only thing holding you back in 10-man then is raid comp or otherwise being incredibly unlucky with RNG... the math just doesn't support that running 10-man for loot is inferior.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's a bad comparison because the same thing can happen in a 25-man, especially when you can get multiples of the same item from one boss kill. My 25-man group DE'd loot off of our first T11 boss kill because Magmaw dropped 3 two-handed maces, and only 2 people in the raid could use it/wanted it.<br />
<br />
Check the post right before yours for the math that shows once all factors are accounted for, the chance of you getting a particular piece of loot is almost exactly the same between 10 and 25-man. 25-man does start to pull ahead as more and more people get geared, reducing the number of people rolling on a given piece of loot.<br />
<br />
Edit: After updated math, it seems that 10-man is actually better off.</div></div><hr />

Wow.. if only there was a test server where the public could go to test things and give feedback on those things before it went live. But you are right, if they did have a test server for the public, they would probably end up updating it frequently and players would only see half of some systems at a time and blow it out of proportion before the full change was implemented on that test server for the public.<br />

i don't think you understood the arguments then, no one was complaining about heriocs capping you (if they were they were just retarded and injecting dumb thoughts into a legit argument), they were complaining that raids were NOT. It was about raiders not wanting to kill 7-8 bosses, then still have to kill 8 more bosses in obsolete raid content, or run a bunch of heroics after the fact to finish capping. raiders wanted to cap vp in the time they invested in the current content raids. that was the blunt of the argument. We did not want to be burdened with running a bunch of heroics on top of raiding several nights a week to min max our VP intake. If you're a progression guild and working on heroic encounters, clearning 7 bosses isn't going to just be magic faceroll first weeks, but you're gonna need VP caps the most the first weeks. so you'll invest al your raid time into progression and not want to bother with heroics. maybe when you have 7 bosses on farm and clear it in one night you won't mind heroics. but i personally don't want to raid several nights a week then be told i still gotta do several heroics on top of it. I make time for raiding in my schedule, but I'm not going to be bothered to run a bunch of heroics i don't need anything from just for VP. That was the argument that was made, and blizz did listen, because it was just common sense. Adjusting the Vp for raid bosses since there are less of them. Problem solved. No reason to change heroics, what for?i don't think that's what the majority complained about. I agree with you that anyone who did is just dumb.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think there was a little of both, you even see some comments in this thread where people are annoyed that non-raiders have the same VP cap as raiders. Agreed though, the bigger issue was where raiders were unhappy because they would have to do troll heroics to get capped. But I still think there will be some resentment lingering regarding non-raiders having the same cap.</div></div><hr />

In spite on what the table in the post says, if you do all 25-person bosses and BH, you still get the same 980 VP that alts running 7 trolls do. I.e., in spite of many comments, there was no cap change. Merely that successful raiders would no longer need to do any heroics to cap.<br />

It's because they don't play their own game anymore. Internally they are playing Diablo 3 and Titan now. So many gaffs this expansion cycle because they literally are winging it on a lot of decisions. Ghostcrawler has always been a weak designer, but without oversight, all the designers (most of them junior and new to WoW) are really botching things on a regular basis. Their management is to blame also, for allocating far fewer resources and funding to the game - it shows when they cut corners to the extent they have. It's all about profit now.<br />
As for stgeorge78, just stop. We all know you'd like to pretend you're a forum allstar, but it doesn't help when you're blatantly spouting false information you don't even know about.

If that is the real reason why people were mad, then they need to learn to add. You can't get capped doing only raids right now, unless you are in a 25-man guild that is 13/13 AND does BH every week, which would account for less than 1% of guilds in the WORLD. And by the time you are that progressed, it is highly unlikely that you would need the valor points anyway. So what was the problem? I mean, I suppose you could get closer to the cap now vs what they had proposed, but not by that much. Certainly not enough to justify the massive amounts of QQ that was going on.</div></div><hr />

It is really MMO-champion that gave you the headache.. Blizzard never said anything about the cap going above 980, MMO-champ just did this chart to show people that they could easily get over the cap without doing heroic 5 mans.... and in the end, it made it look (to some people) like Blizzard raised the cap.<br />

Yeah, but in tier 11(now), troll heroics still are semi-meaningful for many raiders. Maybe to fill a slot you have had bad luck with, or at the least for BOEs that sell for 1k or the bear mount. That is the reason nobody is complaining now.. plus they are fairly new. The real problem was looking forward at the next 6 months when all of those motivations are meaningless except for the VP. I still think it was overblown anyway since a group of raiders will be able to faceroll them in 4.2 in 20 minutes and you would have only had to do it once or twice per week.</div></div><hr />

Various factors if something is more difficult than another, of course assuming you have a guild of only pro players then 25 would be the easier format on most encounters. However thats rarely the case, there will in most situations be some players in a 25man roster that are not as aware of movement and such. 25man raids also stresses your computer more leading to more disconnects, then there is the whole organizing aspect you have the same space to move on as on 10 which isn't always that big and this and that. There are multiple factors why one or the other would be easier or not, personally for having done both on heroic i find them pretty much equal.<br />
<br />
And i fail to see how the VP change has anything to do with whichever is easier. Any raider that cares about what gear they can potentially get would cap their valor weekly regardless which way you have to go about it.</div></div><hr />

Anyway, still had a good laugh. :)<br />
<br />
Ele shaman being bad today (and tomorrow) doesn't mean it will always be bad, there could be some buffs coming in 4.2.1/4.2.2/4.3 and by that time Dragonwrath will still be awesome, so why not ?</div></div><hr />

it's all about what gives the most stats, currently 372 + 372 shield and weapon would gives best stats but if there was a legendary this tier then it would obviously be the best way to go.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kujja</div><div class="date">2011-06-16, 04:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I find the VP change interesting being that current 25 mans are much easier than 10 mans. I hope it's not the same in 4.2<br />
<br />
The only fight I can think of that's easier in 10 man is Ala'kir.<br />
<br />
Some fights are easier in 10 man, some easier in 25 man.<br />
A reason why 10 man seems a lot harder is that it can be very setup based, which makes it hard for some groups but easy for others... if a boss is easily killable with a certain setup then it doesn't make it hard just because it can't be killed as easy with another setup.<br />
The only 10 man heroics I've fought are Conclave and Al'Akir, both of which are far easier on 10 man... I won't say which is easier for other bosses as I don't know for sure, but from what people have said, I'm pretty sure that it's about an equal amount of easy bosses on both 10 and 25.<br />
<br />
Also - the reason for more valor points is to give more incentive to raid 25 man... if there was no incentive it would make it slightly harder for 25 man guilds to recruit as well as killing off a few 25 man guilds (not saying it will kill 25 man raiding, but it would be a step towards that)<br />

A lot of guilds give legendaries to people that deserve it the most for being active, reliable and for helping the guild, even if it could be much better for another class. Also, as someone else said.. just because ele shaman may be bad now.. it doesn't mean it will be bad in 4.2 (I'm pretty sure it's getting buffed... as well as the new tier bonus (?) being quite strong)</div></div><hr />

Internally they are playing Diablo 3 and Titan now. So many gaffs this expansion cycle because they literally are winging it on a lot of decisions. Ghostcrawler has always been a weak designer, but without oversight, all the designers (most of them junior and new to WoW) are really botching things on a regular basis. Their management is to blame also, for allocating far fewer resources and funding to the game - it shows when they cut corners to the extent they have. It's all about profit now.<br />
<br />
I looked up speculation and misinformation in the dictionary and they both had your name on it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually... it's well known that they've pulled off a lot of the top designers for Titan. There are still people that have been around for a long time, but WoW's current role is (and has been since sometime during Wrath) the cashcow whose milk provides for the other franchises.<br />
<br />
Playtesting for Titan and D3 is well underway--as recent interviews and tours of Blizz HQ have shown.<br />
<br />
The only parts of his post that're &quot;speculation&quot; are the pieces about GC and his management. If you look at how GC behaves towards the community and half of the stuff he says publicly, then you'll understand why the poster speculates what he speculates.<br />
<br />
The bottom line is that Blizzard has been phoning it in for awhile so it can finish up other projects. Of course they'll continue developing WoW for another decade. That doesn't mean it's going to be high quality content. The number of bosses this tier are the fewest since the ren fair patch and blue posts have said that they feel that 7 is a &quot;good number&quot; per tier. At the start of cata, they wanted two &quot;half raids&quot; per tier. Now they only want one &quot;half raid&quot; per tier. You do realize that says a lot about what Blizzard has become, yes? More evidence? Did you even watch the cinematic? I think that's one thing even the Ren Fair has over 4.2.<br />
<br />
But if you want actual speculation... At some point they'll realize the value of the cash shop and make it FTP. At that point, they won't have to worry about people complaining about their development cycle (it's free, afterall). They can release an infinite number of ren fair raids (it's free, afterall). At that point they can afford to have the majority of effort in the game in the cash shop--which at this point is just another way for Blizzard to print money.<br />
<br />
Copies of this game will never sell out again on launch day, but you know what has? Sparklepony and sunshine kitten. The importance of the cash shop going forward isn't even speculation. Tell me that's not the future of the game after listening to the earnings conference call.</div></div><hr />
