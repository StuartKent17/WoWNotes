Blizzard posted another announcement! April 1st is definitely an eventful day. <br />
The act of jubilant self-expression through dancing has long been an integral part of World of Warcraft's social interactions. Now it's been taken to a whole new level with the new Dance Battle system, coming to the game in an upcoming content patch. Combining elements of Arena competition with the dynamism and creativity of coordinated, player-controlled dance animations, Dance Battles offer a whole new kind of crew-versus-crew challenge.<br />
<br />
So you think you can dance?<br />
From the interdimensional fortress known as Tempest Keep, Kael'thas Sunstrider has issued a challenge far and wide to dance crews throughout Kalimdor, the Eastern Kingdoms, and Northrend -- in order to find out who is Azeroth's best dance crew!<br />
<br />
He's handpicked his judges from nearby Area 52 in Outland and retrofitted his flying fortress for its new purpose -- to host a series of exhilarating dance-offs. He's also relocated his fiery, faithful companion A'lar and retooled the phoenix's chamber to accommodate the competition. It's here that your crew will find the NPC dancemasters, who will allow you to initiate a dance-off or accept another crew's challenge.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
You'd better bring it!<br />
You perform dance moves using a custom interface similar to those that appear when controlling a vehicle in Wrath of the Lich King. The custom action bar displays all available dance moves, which each crew member can individually configure by speaking to the appropriate NPC before the competition.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/march/ss5-x_small.jpg (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/march/ss5-x.jpg) http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/march/ss6-x_small.jpg (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/march/ss6-x.jpg) http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/march/ss7-x_small.jpg (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/march/ss7-x.jpg)<br />
<br />
Next, your crew will need to create their routine. To practice, simply select a backing track, and the music will begin after a brief countdown. The best routines are carefully planned out in advance and executed with individual skill as well as with an overall group dynamic in mind.<br />
<br />
Warstomp the yard<br />
Once engaged in a Dance Battle, simply select the dance move you wish to perform, and your character will execute it. As with the Arena system, close communication and teamwork is crucial -- you'll have to be in sync, both with the music as well as with the other members of your crew, to become the &quot;server&quot; and not the &quot;servee.&quot;<br />

Although we cannot become one in game to play, we could get that rippin axe guitar and perform a sweet short solo performance with it. <br />
<br />
Its that Arcanite Ripper from the Scourge Invasion event before WoTLK came out. The drop from that boss in the room behind the door above Attumen. Funny thing is most folks saw it as a so so 2-hander DPS axe with ok stats for fresh level 70s. I picked it up on my shaman for fun since nobody wanted it as they had far better.<br />
<br />
About a week or two later we were doing AQ40 at the Twin Emperors when I was just goofing around with my UI and somehow I clicked on this in my character window..... EVERYONE WAS LIKE WTF. I shortly figured it out as I saw the 60 second cooldown timer on it. It was a mad race to get as many of these for my friends.</div></div><hr />

That being said, this event I thought was sort of meh, since they did the guitar one last year and this is pretty close to the same theme, but the amount of detail that went into this does make it work pretty well.<br />

Now the WoW website has a &quot;Dance Battle&quot; system. That sounds and looks just as bad as &quot;Meet The Spartans&quot;<br />
<br />
My question: Where's the &quot;Cardboard Box Mat&quot; at? I was looking for that epic loot since vanilla WoW. Yo homies! Werd up! Werd to yo moms! <br />
<br />
Also let's not forget the &quot;Vanilla Ice&quot; hair style from the Barbershop. <br />
<br />
And since WoW decided to bring up the concept of &quot;Stomp the Yard&quot;, what frat or sort do you represent? LOL</div></div><hr />

Mages have an unfair advantage because of blink so that should be removed. Druids have an unfair advantage because they can change form so from now they shouldn't be able to. Hunters have an unfair advantage because whats cuter than someone dancing with their pet. From now on hunters shouldn't have pets. All other classes with speed increases have an unfair advantage so that should probably be fixed. Gomes have an advantage because they are cute so remove them. Blood elves have an advantage because no one dances better than a male questioning their sexuality. <br />
<br />
What, they won't balance the whole game around a mini game?</div></div><hr />

The reward gear would have to look simply priceless so that all the looks newbs could be happy with this gear and wear instead of Uludar25 gear even if the stats sucked worse than level 70 gear.</div></div><hr />

It's a pity they didn't do the same for our EU forums too. :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
What is amazing though is that people will even QQ about jokes on a day such as april the 1st. I find that even more hillarious that the actual &quot;events&quot; announced on this day. You QQ-ers just make our days, with you, there is never a lack of funny events in our lives :-*. <br />
Ty for being here for us.</div></div><hr />

5v5: Unless I'm missing something, 'Santa Destroy Heroes' is a reference to 'No More Heroes'; a Wii game. The town of the hero--Travis Touchdown--is called 'Santa Destroy'. 'Boom!' is something frequently shouted by Travis during his 'roulette wheels'.<br />
<br />
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Destroy (redirects to No More Heroes)<br />
<br />
8v8: A reference to Bring It On.<br />
<br />
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bring_It_On_(film)<br />
<br />
&quot;Brrrr, it's cold in here! There must be some Clovers in the atmosphere!&quot;<br />
<br />
Edit: Oh, and one of the items; &quot;The Orange&quot; Cardboard Box is likely a reference to 'The Orange Box'; the amazing, award-winning compilation by Valve containing Portal, Half-Life 2 (+ Episodes 1 &amp; 2) and Team Fortress 2.</div></div><hr />
