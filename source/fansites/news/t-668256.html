World of Warcraft TCG - Scourgewar<br />
Carlsbad, CA (September 11, 2009) – The Upper Deck Company is pleased to announce that its 10th World of Warcraft Trading Card Game’s expansion set – entitled Scourgewar – will be released on November 24. TCG players in the online realms have been hard at work in Northrend for almost a year now, with the Wrath of the Lich King letting adventurers land on the frozen continent and take on everything it has to offer. And now the action will be coming to your local game store.<br />
<br />
Amid the powerful new Death Knight cards and other secrets Upper Deck has waiting for players in this next expansion, you’re probably dying to get a look at the newest additions to the Loot card assortment. Without further adieu, let’s dive right in.<br />
<br />
Loot Cards<br />
Tiny<br />
Say hello to our newest little friend. Tauren and Draenei, now we have the ultimate irony you’ve been waiting for. The newest super-common Loot card will give you a mini mount that will carry you around as fast as his little legs will take him—which isn’t any faster than your character can run, but hey, it’s the thought that counts. Each code will be redeemed for 50 uses, so you’ll be able to get lots of work out of Tiny for each card you get your hands on.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Tuskarr Kite<br />
One of the coolest factions to make their appearance in Wrath of the Lich King, the Tuskarr are a Walrus-like species of humanoids that like to fish. One of the things you’ve probably noticed while running around and doing their errands is the cool decorations they have around their towns. With Tuskarr Kite, you’ll be able to own your own decorative kite that functions just like the Onyxia Kite from March of the Legion’s Kiting Loot card. This uncommon Loot card also counts towards your companion pet achievements, so if you’re still working towards your new pets, the Kite will help too!<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Spectral Kitten<br />
The Spectral Tiger is the quintessential Loot card for collectors out there, and now they’ll have a little kitten to add to their spectral menagerie. This companion pet comes with tiny little armor to match his size, and lets out a haunting meow when you click on him. Stop to check your mail and it will wait patiently for you, and then run to catch up to you when you head on your way after business has been attended to. As the rare Loot card of the expansion, this is one kitty that plenty of fans will want to get their hands on!<br />
<br />

<br />
Take Them for a Test Drive (Important - Apparently these codes arent active on PTRs for the moment, they will most likely be activated in the next build)<br />
Would you like to get your hands on these items and take them for a test drive? Simply head over to the Public Test Realm (PTR) and try them out by visiting Landro Longshot, and using the following three codes:<br />
<br />
Tiny: 3333<br />
Tuskarr Kite: 2222<br />
Spectral Kitten: 1111<br />
<br />
Scourgewar is still two months away, but Northrend has these exciting Loot cards to look forward to, in addition to the powerful cards waiting to earn a spot in your decks. Stay connected for additional updates of Scourgewar at WoWTCG.com (http://www.wowtcg.com). <br />

Tie in Warsong Gulch<br />
This is a new change that has been applied to live realms as well.<br />
<br />
If the game is tied when the game ends, the winner will now be the team that most recently captured the flag, rather than the team captured the first flag. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/13/19820543755-wsg.html))<br />
<br />
RMP Teams in Arenas<br />
To address the (frankly overblown) RMP &quot;bias&quot;, we're seeing a lot more comps this season so far, which is cool. We just want to make sure those comps are doing something besides just blowing someone up. We certainly think the Arena can support more than RMP, which is why we have made so many changes for other classes. But the reason a lot of players like the RMP playstyle, and why some consider it the only legit team (though that is emphatically not our viewpoint) is because it requires a lot of coordination and layering of abilities. That's not to say RMP can't go for the blow someone up strategy on occasion, and there is nothing fundamentally wrong with that strategy existing, as long as it's not the only one. When every match feels like the same match, Arena gets a lot less interesting. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/19820522951-earthen-power-nerf-overkill.html))<br />
<br />
Tanking - Balancing Effective Health and Cooldowns<br />
EH is very important. But it is not the all there is to tank balance. I suspect even the players that first came up with that way of describing survivability would admit that it gets focused on too much these days. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/19820323808-eh-and-cds-must-be-balanced.html))<br />
<br />
Race Changes ETA<br />
A race change is only a slightly more simplistic technical process than a faction change. Given that, it was pretty important to get the conversion frame work for the faction change service developed first before offering additional services like race changes. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/19820514166-qs-on-race-change-not-qq.html))<br />
<br />
The end of classes changes<br />
It will never happen because we're always going to be adding content to the game (including class content) that will require us to make adjustments to each class. Additionally, classes scale differently with gear and content, and we always have to monitor that closely and change things as needed. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/19717645758-the-end-of-class-changes.html))<br />
<br />
PvP/PvE versions of spells<br />
Internal consistency for belief in the game world is part of it. Just keeping complexity down is another part of it. We don't want to see every spell or talent have two tooltips and players having to keep all of that straight. It just feels like two games with one art set at that point, which isn't what we're going for. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/19820323714-relationship-of-pve-to-pvp.html))<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ideathknights.gif Death Knight<br />
Heart Strike in 3.2.2<br />
Heart Strike is balanced around its single target damage since its a primary ability for Blood. However, since it can strike a second target for full damage (on live), Blood dps jumps up dramatically just because of the presence of a second target. The ability needs to be either balanced around its single target or dual target dps. If it's the latter, you're going to use Blood Strike on a lot of attacks instead and the core strike for the tree becomes more situational, which feels lame.<br />
<br />
It will still keep the kit of hitting a second target, and Blood dps will still jump up when you can cleave a second target. Just not as much. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/19820503872-gc-could-you-explain-the-heart-strike-nerf.html))<br />
<br />
[...] We'll write a more clear tooltip, something like: Instantly strike a target, causing 50% weapon damage plus 368 and 10% additional damage for each disease. Also strikes a secondary target for half of what it strikes the original. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/13/19820322991-why-are-you-buffing-heart-strikebone-shield.html))<br />
<br />
Shamans and Cleansing Totems<br />
It's overpowered. Long-term we need some kind of overhaul to the dispel system so that you can free allies who get debuffed or CC'd but you aren't constantly losing important class abilities because of cheap, fast and sometimes pulsing dispels.<br />
<br />
I'm being vague because we haven't announced any 3.2.2 or 3.3 changes yet. Those won't be the overhaul I described, but we hope to do something. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/19820872699-yay--more-dk-nerfs.html))<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ipaladins.gif Paladin<br />
Changes to Hammer of the Righteous and High Threat Abilities<br />
High threat abilities are always going to be part of the game for the simple reason that we don't want tanks to do as much damage as dps specs, but they need to generate more threat than the dps specs.<br />
<br />
It only gets to be a problem when those abilities don't scale with gear or the tank spec is so woeful at dps that it's impossible to solo or contribute meaningfully when not tanking.<br />
<br />
In this case, the loss of threat from switching from Holy to physical damage necessitated adding additional threat.<br />
<br />
Having said all that, we don't have a lot of confidence that this change will actually go live, so I wouldn't freak out just yet. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/19820633566-more-causes-high-threat-abilities.html))<br />
<br />

Earthen Power Nerf<br />
We think Earthen Power and the Ghost Wolf change were trying to solve the same problem. Together they felt like overkill to us, and we thought the Ghost Wolf change was more interesting so we kept that one. Your mileage may vary and I would be surprised if many shaman agreed since they were the target of the nerf. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/19820522951-earthen-power-nerf-overkill.html))<br />
<br />
Flame Shock duration change in 3.2.2<br />
We don't think the coefficient needs to change. We literally just added the duration bonus from the old glyph so that you didn't need that glyph to function. We could have a long discussion about mandatory glyphs for dps specs, but let's not have it here. :)<br />
<br />
The dot coefficient rule that I think you're implying isn't necessarily something we follow anymore.<br />
<br />
You get two more ticks on Flame Shock, which frees up GCDs to cast other spells. If the glyph was a dps increase, and it generally was held to be, then the change to Flame Shock should be too. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/13/19820323718-bug-flame-shock.html))<br />
<br />
3.2.2 Glyph of Flame Shock (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/41531/glyph-of-flame-shock/)<br />
Most of the posts I've read on the last few pages seem to get the purpose of the change (to make it so the spec could function without the glyph), but there are still a few confused shaman. Reread the thread and you'll see some good explanations in there.<br />
<br />
This was not intended to be a massive Elemental dps increase. It was intended to solve a problem that may not have been important to you personally, but was important to a lot of shaman.<br />
<br />
One thing I will add is to fret less about scaling. In BC if you didn't scale well, you were going to be in trouble for many tiers of content. These days we adjust classes so frequently that it's much less of an issue. Worst case is you will start to slip slightly behind other classes as everyone gets gear, but then the very next tier will be a reset (and honestly we really only have one tier left).<br />
<br />
Put another way, if you and your friend start an instance at 5000 dps and then as you get gear she goes to 7000 dps while you go to 6000 dps, then that's a scaling problem. But under out current design philosophy in WoW we will adjust you if you fall that far behind. Yes in an ideal world all the talents and glyphs would be set up in such a way that we'd never need to adjust them and all classes would scale linearly (or even exponentially) with the same slope. The reality is that we tweak things and some scaling mismatches are inevitable (if for no other reason than melee scale differently than casters). (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/19820523736-ele-322-did-not-increase-flm-shock-damage.html))<br />
<br />
3.2.2 Glyph of Flame Shock (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/41531/glyph-of-flame-shock/) and T8 Set Bonus<br />
We aren't changing the set bonus. Most shaman will outgrow it eventually. If you have the set bonus, you can look at other glyphs for the moment if that works for you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And yet it continues to be the worst ability out of Heart Strike, Frost Strike, and Scourge Strike. And for an attack that is balanced around its single target damage, why does it suffer from the auras that lower AoE damage, as seen on the Ice Elemental trash packs before Hodir and the Faction Champions in the Crusader raid? I'm forced to use Blood Strike on them since hitting 2 targets is considered &quot;area of effect&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
BTW: what's the 15 grey characters abvoe their grid? I don't think they have so many pets. <br />
<br />
SS's, but it looks like they didn't use them.<br />
<br />
Seems the tactic basically involves using only 2 kites in phase 2, this allows for a second phase 2, which you normally wouldn't get. Paladin's BoP seems key here, you can see in the vid just how fast he catches them. Check the kite from 5:25 to 5:53 - how is that survivable?! BoP + Dispersion + Pain suppression? Timing on cooldowns must be perfect I guess. <br />
Although you clearly also need insanely high DPS. Because you STILL only have 2 kite phases, and those adds all need to die on time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Looking at the video it looked the kill was pretty much perfect, no deaths and using soulstones ( wich means they have pretty much perfected their strategy) so the warlocks at this point are looking like just there to piss off everyone else :D<br />
About saying premonition pioneering strategy without holy wrath, how can you give credit to premonition when paragon killed it without holy wrath before premonition released vid of their kill. But looking at the raid composition it looks like they brought more aoe this time, ie. no hunters and only one dps shaman.</div></div><hr />

I said it before, piss off ppl like you, so you have something to whine<br />
<br />
Premonition give a screenshot which includes all clues. Go ask your godly Paragon whether they benefit from it or not. If you have any observation skills you would see that only thing changed from the first kill is that they have more aoe in the raid and tanks for the adds that were previously stunned. 1+1=2. <br />
I would assume you are from US because europe doesn't really produce ppl like with that low IQ.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Our strategy was exactly the same as on the first reset, just without the stuns. Of course, we did some minor tweaks on the general and healer setup that we learned from the first week. You're just making way too big of a fuss about Holy Wrath, having it on DR has little to no impact on how we do the fight.<br />
<br />
Not trying to downplay Premonition - they obviously did an awesome job getting as close to a kill as they did on the first week, and then killing it with 25+ tries left this week.</div></div><hr />

What are you on about? We benched our DK MT already after ~10 wipes on the very first reset and took up a 10 man Ulduar geared warrior ALT to replace him. So yes, we had 2 warriors for ~35 wipes even before our first kill. Anyone who has done more than 2 wipes on this encounter should realise why we did this. The changes to our setup for the second kill were mainly to bring more AOE dps. We didn't change anything because of Premonition's kill.</div></div><hr />

Your logic is mind blowing mate. Lets say they had SS up when they did that kill (talking about anub 45), which they didn't even use! Now, this is almost the same thing as driving a car which has an airbag, you maybe want to have it just in case you happen to crash. They proved they killed Anub HC and got the achievement, world first. Simple and beautiful. Now go back to your shelter and /cry because you didn't get this first (Well never).<br />

<br />
Yes or No<br />
<br />
There were talks of it before half the attempts were used, but our warriors didn't exactly have block gear handy and we had done every other instance already. With the stuns it simply wasn't necessary to go nuts on block, so we didn't. Surprisingly enough, with stuns gone and a fresh reset's worth of gear the situation was different.<br />
<br />
If you honestly believe we didn't know about block being superb on the encounter before Premo killed it, even after we ditched a fully geared DK maintank for some crap warrior alt long before they got even low % tries on it, I don't know what would convince you.<br />
<br />
(In hindsight, we probably should've gone for maxed block gear on the first reset already, even if the gear was far from perfect. Would've probably saved a few tries.)</div></div><hr />

Our strategy was the same. We had some changes with the setup. Still, the same 3 tanks, 7 healers (shaman instead of a druid), 15 dps (moonkin + mage instead of a hunter and ele shaman). We made the changes to get more reliable penetrating cold healing after finding out a better way to keep more of the raid alive by other means.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Of course, we did some minor tweaks on the general and healer setup that we learned from the first week.<br />
<br />
I really don't consider swapping some gems on a warrior to be a game-breaking strategy change on a fight like Anub. Strategy is kiting it around the room in aquatic form. Strategy is tanking four adds in one pile with one tank versus tanking two adds in two piles with two tanks. It was a tweak on the setup along with supplying a bit more healing power to the tanks. <br />
<br />
You can get all semantic on calling it strategy or not if you want to. You're quoting my stuff, this is my context.<br />
<br />
This was a tweak to react to the Holy Wrath nerf. We knew we have to use more block when the nerf was announced, before Premonition posted the fabled screenshot. They deserve credit for being awesome and getting the third kill for it - props to them - but they do not deserve credit for showing us block is good. The fact that they killed it with block before us is irrelevant; we knew we'd be using more block this reset before they killed it.<br />
<br />
Since you just seem to be hell-bent on what you decided to think in the first place, I'm through wasting my time explaining this to you if you still don't get it after this.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Diivil</div><div class="date">2009-09-12, 06:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You guys made me feel very sick.

<br />
You are acknowledging that we did find out about the block (as we did on our third pull or so and that's why we got an alt warrior in the raid in the first place). But then at the same time you are saying that a guild of 30 players wouldn't instantly come up with the idea of stacking block and would have to have another guild to tell us that? How deluded are you exactly?<br />
<br />
The simple reasons why our tanks didn't go full out on block on our first kill were:<br />
1. they couldn't, they simply didn't have the gear.<br />
2. they didn't need to, the adds were stunned 80% of the fight.<br />
3. we had 2 tanks instead of Premo's 1 so it wasn't 100% crucial that they had the gear.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pokchop</div><div class="date">2009-09-12, 07:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heart Strike is balanced around its single target damage since its a primary ability for Blood. However, since it can strike a second target for full damage (on live), Blood dps jumps up dramatically just because of the presence of a second target. The ability needs to be either balanced around its single target or dual target dps. If it's the latter, you're going to use Blood Strike on a lot of attacks instead and the core strike for the tree becomes more situational, which feels lame.<br />
<br />
It will still keep the kit of hitting a second target, and Blood dps will still jump up when you can cleave a second target. Just not as much.<br />
<br />
BS answer. This reasoning pretty much applies to any class that can cleave. -_-</div></div><hr />

Sure I know you are gods and know every single trick in this game. Go with your 15 twink aribag warlocks, they will teach you how to beat any encounter, lol<br />

<br />
There are groups of people (like Paragon) who invest more time than others to beat high end World of Warcraft encounters amongst first or even first.<br />
<br />
Me... i personally play in one 3 day/week raiding guild enjoying this game as much as one 3 day raiding guild can give tho i really like to watch how high end guilds progress through encounters and always keep myself updated.<br />

Yes, because everyone else doing it makes it fine! ::)<br />
<br />
People are &quot;crying foul&quot; because it's obviously lame and in the same spirit as the KJ kills that had 4 paladin buffs but only one paladin in the raid.

Paragon is great but you need to know some facts before posting here. <br />
<br />
1. Both Paragon and Stars used the holy wrath chain in their first kill. Premonition is the first one killed it without holy wrath.<br />
<br />
2. Paragon is the only guild known so far to have a twink warlock guild soulstone their raid, which degrades all their previous kills since Ulduar (No, I am not saying exploit or illegal, I am saying DEGRADE) <br />
<br />
3. Pargaon showed 15 alt warlock in their Twins video. Many soulstones in their first Anub'arak video and again 15 grey characters in the current Anub'arak video<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phoenix10k</div><div class="date">2009-09-12, 11:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">One thing I will add is to fret less about scaling. In BC if you didn't scale well, you were going to be in trouble for many tiers of content. These days we adjust classes so frequently that it's much less of an issue. Worst case is you will start to slip slightly behind other classes as everyone gets gear, but then the very next tier will be a reset (and honestly we really only have one tier left).<br />
<br />
Put another way, if you and your friend start an instance at 5000 dps and then as you get gear she goes to 7000 dps while you go to 6000 dps, then that's a scaling problem. But under out current design philosophy in WoW we will adjust you if you fall that far behind. Yes in an ideal world all the talents and glyphs would be set up in such a way that we'd never need to adjust them and all classes would scale linearly (or even exponentially) with the same slope. The reality is that we tweak things and some scaling mismatches are inevitable (if for no other reason than melee scale differently than casters).<br />
<br />
Alright, fine, put your money where your mouth is, Blizzard. Full T8 elemental shaman do significantly less DPS than full T8 retribution paladins, feral druids, and moonkins; and full T8 resto shaman heal moderately less than full T8 holy paladins and resto druids. On top of that, shaman can't tank, while paladins and druids can. Not to mention that most of our totem buffs can now be overridden by paladin, warlock, and druid talents. You say you want to equalize the hybrid classes, then do it. Quit treating shaman like the red-headed stepchildren of hybrid classes, and we'll stop complaining.<br />
<br />
<br />
3.2.2 Glyph of Flame Shock and T8 Set Bonus<br />
We aren't changing the set bonus. Most shaman will outgrow it eventually. If you have the set bonus, you can look at other glyphs for the moment if that works for you.<br />
<br />
Ugh... I agree that most shaman will outgrow it, but leaving in this redundancy smacks of laziness and a general indifference to shaman. They could have just changed it to a 5% buff on the periodic damage of Flame Shock or something. Guess I'll get a Glyph of Totem of Wrath.</div></div><hr />

Now, you're so desperate that you're making up a bunch of theories about them copying another guild's strat? Even if we ASSUME that paragon has a spy inside premonition and copied their entire strat, the fact still remains that they killed it within 45 and nobody else has up until now. Surely that makes them the temporarily best at something, right? Stop your petty attempts to ruin a good guild's reputation already.</div></div><hr />

Actually, watch Phase 3 at 1 min 5 seconds. Carefully watch the DK synti(think thats how its spelt). Notice how the health bar goes completely black for 2-3 seconds, then pops back up. Im quite sure black bar=dead:) Again, at 1 min 42 seconds, The Paladin Iloni goes completely black, then pops back up after a few seconds. And AGAIN, at 2 mins 17 seconds, the mage Ceviu goes black, along with the priest Nalin. And at 2 mins 42 seconds, Devah the death knight goes black, then pops back up. I could go on watching the other half of P3 but i think this is enough:) Flame/support/ do whatever:)</div></div><hr />

I was talking about their twins kill which set off all the soulstone hate. I only made it through the first half of the anub one but if what you say is true then I'm surprised the haters settled for the &quot;strat theft&quot; argument :D. Either way, my 10man used an alt paladin to buff kings yesterday. I guess we're exploiters too...</div></div><hr />

Way to miss half his abilities. DPSing isn't hard, just like tanking and healing aren't hard. The only thing that separates some players from others is how well they perform those tasks, and in order to be able to evaluate that, and the complexity of their class, you need at least a little experience which you, by your own admission, lack.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Posokhov</div><div class="date">2009-09-13, 01:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">RMP Teams in Arenas<br />
To address the (frankly overblown) RMP &quot;bias&quot;, we're seeing a lot more comps this season so far, which is cool. We just want to make sure those comps are doing something besides just blowing someone up. We certainly think the Arena can support more than RMP, which is why we have made so many changes for other classes. But the reason a lot of players like the RMP playstyle, and why some consider it the only legit team (though that is emphatically not our viewpoint) is because it requires a lot of coordination and layering of abilities. That's not to say RMP can't go for the blow someone up strategy on occasion, and there is nothing fundamentally wrong with that strategy existing, as long as it's not the only one. When every match feels like the same match, Arena gets a lot less interesting.<br />
<br />
Did anybody notice how GC says, &quot;as long as it's not the only one&quot; (in terms of strategies) as if RMP uses a strategy besides &quot;tunnel vision the healer&quot;? Let's look at what MLG Dallas taught us.<br />
<br />
RMP tunnel visioned healers and only changed their tactic when the healer wasn't the easiest kill on the team (i.e. a rogue that's only good because he has PvE gear on live).<br />
x6tence ran PHD most of the tournament and actually changed their strategy up more often than not.<br />
RLS, considered a &quot;skill comp&quot;, didn't switch targets either. They tunnel visioned almost every game.<br />
Beastcleave tunnel visioned clothies.<br />
<br />
So of the four comps we saw, x6tence's PHD, considered a &quot;cheesy&quot; comp by a lot of people, was the only one that demonstrated the ability to change targets like Ghostcrawler said. Doesn't this mean that RLS and RMP both need nerfs so that their strategies have to involve a little more than, &quot;TUNNEL VISION THAT DUDE!&quot;?</div></div><hr />

But as a resto/tank druid main who occasionally plays a pure dps Ele Shaman, I'm a cooldown watcher....<br />
<br />
and watching his timers, the vast majority (and I've no idea about mages so please correct me) he (maybe a she) was casting their go-to aoe spell, or their go-to nuke spell. and that seemed to be about it.<br />

Well to name a few basic things for this fight: <br />
<br />
1) Keeping living bomb on the boss as close to 100% of the time as you can as well as on all adds (which means 5 LBs running at once) when they spawn and potentially refreshing it on them if you know they will survive another 12 seconds. Keep in mind that sitting there tabbing through 5 mobs to find the one you want to refresh it on is something a BAD mage would do. <br />
<br />
2) Being as efficient as possible with hot streak procs. It's not hard but also not as easy as some think. <br />
<br />
3) Knowing the best time to use his cooldowns (from what I recall, he had icy veins, the glove enchant, trinket, and probably a pot and combustion though in its current state it's so shit lots of mages don't take it). <br />
<br />
4) Mana management. With such intensive aoe it might be better to evocate early so it would be up again before the end. On the other hand, ending the fight with most your mana bar is a waste if you did two evocates so you have to have an accurate knowledge of how far your mana will take you. Should you use a dps pot or a mana pot?<br />
<br />
This is as much as I can be bothered to write at this hour and I also didn't watch most of the video so I can't comment on the specific mage's performance, though I'm sure he did very well given the damage meters we saw :).</div></div><hr />

you have taken the time to instruct someone who has no interest in being a mage, just how involved it can be.<br />

I seriously thought I was paying attention to the video and I honestly wrote everything I thought was important.<br />
<br />
You have raised procs and talents god knows what to show me I am a fool blowing my horn prematurely.<br />

Sadly it's late in the night so perhaps this will go unheralded but as someone who has never, and will never, play a pure dps class; I have new found respect (even though I'll never attempt content that requires this much deliberation)<br />

Heart Strike is balanced around its single target damage since its a primary ability for Blood. However, since it can strike a second target for full damage (on live), Blood dps jumps up dramatically just because of the presence of a second target. The ability needs to be either balanced around its single target or dual target dps. If it's the latter, you're going to use Blood Strike on a lot of attacks instead and the core strike for the tree becomes more situational, which feels lame.<br />
<br />
It will still keep the kit of hitting a second target, and Blood dps will still jump up when you can cleave a second target. Just not as much. (Source)<br />
<br />
<br />
That has to be the biggest pile of horsesh**t from GC yet. The man should be a politician with the amount of garbage he can spew without actually saying anything usefull.. Class balance is a joke with this guy around.. Seems they just blindfold themselves, throw a dart at a nerf/buff board and see what happens. This is a HUGE nerf to DK damage... It will probably make it past testing and the PTR, only to have GC pull his head out his arse a week later &quot;OMG BOOST&quot;, then boost it to 600% OP, then HF it back to be somewhat as it originally was (see deathstrike)</div></div><hr />
