<br />
Timeless Island seems to be very interesting with a lot of different things going on, but it is hard to tell. IMHO, Barrens was a bit of a waste because there was not much replay value. I did it once to get the pet, the rest of the gear rewards were downgrades on my main. For alts, it was a way to get some upgrades, but there are much easier and faster ways to do that. Plus, either you soloÂ´d a crapload of easy mobs, or your ganked the bosses (if you were on during peak times with a lot of other players). Escorting caravans and toppled wagons never really were viable.<br />
<br />
It looks like Timeless Island will have a lot of rare spawns, the AC guys, and a bunch of hidden treasures and min-events. But that could all turn out like the Barrens stuff and just not be viable or worthwhile.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The wolf that you get is from the fos for killing Garrosh on normal(heroic mount still has yet to be shown). Stormcrow will not be the Garrosh mount can 100% guarantee it, it does not fit the instance theme at all with no other stormcrows or druids and there is no part of a boss that looks even remotely like it.</div></div><hr />

You don't think you'll be able to upgrade your cloak again or even that it's just an enchant and will change the look of the cloak but your current ilvl of it will remain the same(608)?</div></div><hr />

There was a thread on the WoW forums recently about making WoW F2P. One of the responses was something like &quot;I would quit if WoW went F2P and P2W and you could buy things like XP boosts and such&quot;, and a lot of people quoted this guy and agreed with him.</div></div><hr />

I understand your position, but I hate leveling so I and many others would buy it. I suspect real money will trump some people not being ok with something. I doubt many will quit over this.<br />
I don't understand why they add an elixir store or not for bonus xp when they could just start selling premade lvl 90 characters I'd be happy to buy few of those.</div></div><hr />

except you can upgrade the epic version to 608, which is you know...higher than 600. There is no upgrade as of yet for the datamined legendary. It would feel kinda weird upgrading a legendary with valor points.</div></div><hr />

The actual cape itself is 600, your's is just upgraded, not to mention we dont know if they'll keep the upgrade vendors in or not.<br />

Sure this is not pay to win but it is a way of blizzard moving ever closer to that format of free to play and the swarm of micro transactions. <br />

That's what it's called. Free to play games have stuff like this. We already pay a subscription. Someone with more money than me should NOT have an advantage in the game over me.

You know Blizzard has all of the power in the world to change that correct? They are simply nickeling and diming their players to avoid artificial longevity that is completely controlled by them. It's cheap, dirty, and fueled by greed. <br />

It's also probably worth noting that it has a vendor price, which is unusual for a cash-bought item.<br />
<br />
I'd imagine it's something more like the old cold-weather flying tome, where if you have a 90, you can buy it from an in game store (i.e. with gold) to make leveling alts in Pandaria faster.<br />
In fact, I'd assume since Blizzard knows selling XP items would be controversial, and since Blizzard knows people data-mine items as soon as they're patched in, that the note on the item was added on purpose to stop people from thinking it'd be sold in the cash-store.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Many games have been known to have &quot;inconvenient&quot; levelling to pressure people into buying the XP boosts.<br />

I don't like money influencing the design of the game, as in just because the CEO wants a new yacht the game starts getting harder and more expensive.</div></div><hr />

Or you know they could offer max level chars from the get go if you reached max level on another character already and that for free. I can't be arsed to level from 1-90 or higher, cause the questing is bland once you've already done it few times, and the dungeon leveling is boring as hell too. <br />

It hasnt been added yet. It could possibly not effect NA or europe. Can this just stop and wait already? Seriously. if people care this much about it IN A PTR STAGE WHERE WE KNOW ALMOST NOTHING, quit wow and move onto something else<br />

Why? Why cancel? I don't understand this mentality. I play the game because I like it, not because I am satisfied with everything in it. Canceling WoW because you don't like one single thing they're adding is like throwing yourself to the ground and holding your breath until you get what you want.</div></div><hr />

I never minded the pet/mount store, but the day I log into WoW and catch myself thinking &quot;hmm I could level this alt faster for just a few dollars&quot;, I've paid my last WoW subscription. That's the kind of &quot;F2P&quot; junk I keep playing WoW to escape. WoW is one of the few games left where I can relax and not worry about whether I should be spending more money to optimize my game time.

<br />
So you willingly admit you have no clue what principal is. You don't understand the concept of voting with your wallet? Some of you act like this game is needed, well it's not. There are TONS of other games out there I can play. I like paying a sub to avoid all that cash grab crap that are in f2p games. If they were to stop charging us subs and went cash shop I'd quit. I would definitely quit if they double dipped and started a cash shop WHILE charging subs. It's the principal of it. I don't support that type of greed and would move on to other games. You act like quitting is a big deal when it really isn't. Millions of people have quit in the last couple years. <br />
<br />
That said the people ignorantly saying people are quitting because of stuff on the ptr. I have yet to read one post in here of someone saying they are quitting. All I've seen is people, including myself saying that if this hits live the cancel button will be pressed. We're not screaming hysterically. I will shrug, hit cancel and go play one of the dozens of games I've bought over the last year that I haven't got around to playing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It is refreshing that everyone, for the most part, has to earn it the old fashioned way, and I will be sad to see World of Warcraft go this route. It will be a deciding factor for me, as far as my subscription goes. This just opens the door for more of the same, and the community would be foolish to not see that fact.<br />
<br />
As much as I love this game, once this goes live, I hate to say it, I do believe it will turn this game into a sub-based game with an expanding cash shop, and that does not sit right with me.<br />
<br />
All f2p games offer XP buffs as their big seller. This is how it starts, but those games are f2p, and either pay to win or pay to have an advantage. If you start the XP potion thing, it will minimize the accomplishments of those who do it with blood, sweat and tears (yes leveling can be a grind). But, in the end, when you do hit max level, you feel a sense of accomplishment that will be diminished with the addition of cash shop buffs.<br />
<br />
There is an old saying, &quot;you give them an inch, and they will take a mile&quot;. If you are comfortable with cash shop buffs, more will come, and you will continue paying a sub to play.<br />
<br />
How is that alright?<br />
<br />
<br />
Hope Blizzard reconsiders its stance.</div></div><hr />

Comments like that are funny honestly, WoW with over 8m sub would still have a monthly fee even if it dropped to 2m, why? because people will buy the store products AND pay the monthly fee :P<br />
