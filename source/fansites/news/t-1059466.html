<br />
Coming in Patch 4.3.2 - Cross-Realm Raids<br />
We previously introduced the ability to form cross-realm parties with Real ID friends (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/190952-new-real-id-party-feature-now-live/), and now with Patch 4.3.2, we're adding the ability for players to use that same functionality to form raids to run older normal or heroic raids, or participate in Battlegrounds!<br />
<br />
This will allow you to join up with your Real ID friends (http://us.battle.net/en/realid/) from other realms and:<br />
<br />
Form a cross-realm raid and use Raid Finder<br />
Jump in to any classic dungeon or raid and be automatically placed in the same instance<br />
Join forces and dominate the Battlegrounds<br />
<br />
<br />
Please note, you will not yet be able to run normal or Heroic Dragon Soul with cross-realm Real ID raids.<br />
<br />
As we look forward to the BattleTag system (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/209494-introducing-battletag/), it’s a very exciting time for World of Warcraft. No matter what realm you and your friends are on you’ll be able to team up and take on group content throughout the game.<br />
<br />
<br />
Darkmoon Faire - Known Issues<br />
We’ve identified a number of issues with the Darkmoon Faire this month, and they should be resolved for the February faire. Specifically, we found problems with:<br />
<br />
<br />
Attempting to turn in the Adventurer's Journal (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/71953/adventurers-journal/) and Captured Insignia (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/71952/captured-insignia/) which are associated with these quests “The Captured Journal” and “The Enemy's Insignia”. If you are having difficulty turning in these items, please contact our customer service department at http://us.battle.net/support/en/ and they will be able to provide you with 5 Darkmoon Prize Tickets per item.<br />
Unfortunately, “The Darkmoon Faire” quest cannot be made available for characters that previously completed the quest. This is due to the fact that this quest is not a new quest, but reuses the old quest ID. We realize this was an error and will be taking steps to not repeat it for future quests, but it does mean that characters that completed it before will not be able to complete the new version with the ticket reward.<br />
The reset of monthly achievement progress experienced by some is unfortunately unable to be reinstated. We apologize for this error and have taken steps to ensure it does not occur again.<br />
<br />
<br />
1. Anything on the drop changes that affect getting dungeon items from low level dungeons for 4/5 of the dungeon artifacts.<br />
This was a bug that is being hotfixed. A character that is not level-appropriate for a dungeon should not get Monstrous Egg (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/71636/monstrous-egg/), Mysterious Grimoire (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/71637/mysterious-grimoire/), Imbued Crystal (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/71635/imbued-crystal/), or Ornate Weapon (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/71638/ornate-weapon/) drops. This is irrespective of whether or not the character has a Darkmoon Adventurer's Guide (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/71634/darkmoon-adventurers-guide/) in her bags.<br />
<br />
2. Or a bug where the item would cease to exist or not spawn if someone without a guide was first to loot the bosses? Or people without a guide able to roll on it if someone with a guide does loot first?<br />
We previously had an issue where Grisly Trophy (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/71096/grisly-trophy/) was only going to the player who recorded the killing blow. They are now distributed randomly. Furthermore, there were previously cases where all of the artifacts listed above could be rolled Need. That has been hotfixed and they are all now flagged Greed-only.<br />
<br />
3. As well as the ridiculously low drop rates of said items where even myself who tries to do at least 4 treatise runs a day sees 0 drops. I will end this fair without one despite putting forth literally hours into looking for one.<br />
Regarding drop rates, these items are dropping as-intended. They are rare, and the quests and achievements that depend on them are intended to take some time to complete. They're comparable to the Darkmoon decks and cards. We made them tradeable, so that players who experience a run of bad luck can still acquire what they're after by trading with friends or buying them on the auction house. <br />
<br />
January's Darkmoon Faire will come to a conclusion on Saturday, Jan. 7 at midnight. The faire will return again on Feb. 5, as planned. We apologize for the inconveniences some players have encountered with these issues. Thank you for your patience and feedback.</div></div><hr />

While it would be against the rules to trade money for such things I could see some trying to do it. Regardless though it will be interesting to see what type of groups are formed via third party sites. Imagine someone posting on MMO-Champion forums looking for 24 more people for Firelands and then everyone using the battletag system to get in a group with each other. To bad cross realm isn't cross region though that might add to many language problems to really be worth it. Great system to release with or around the battletag system.</div></div><hr />

Did you miss this part right under what you quoted?<br />
<br />
&quot;Jump in to any classic dungeon or raid and be automatically placed in the same instance&quot;<br />
<br />
Cross-server xmog runs.<br />
<br />
But yea, they're not going to expand it, they're just going to leave it as-is forever. /smh</div></div><hr />

The idea is that you can join a LFR with your friends from another server. While its true that the current LFR system is cross realm it doesn't allow you to pre-select your group cross realm.</div></div><hr />

There wouldn't be much point in having Pandas pick sides if they didn't intend to elaborate of Alliance vs. Horde in MoP though I would like to see some instances like the Caverns of Time ones where you get a costume be cross-faction though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually, I just did a RF this week with a friend of mine from a different server with Real ID. So this is, imho, false advertising. Why would they advertise for something that's already in the game and working properly, along with things they haven't done yet..... This doesn't make sense.</div></div><hr />

CARRY MEEEEEE!!!&quot; It's like waving a carrot on a stick in front of a horse...you can raid with your friends on a different realm now but you can't raid current content, you can't run it on regular or heroic difficulty, AND you can't do it 10man style. For those of us that don't like 25mans (and also for those who don't have good enough computers to handle them) this is just another useless addition. The PvP part is neat - considering you have friends that PvP... Oh boy...let's get a bunch of 85s together and take 5 whole minutes to clear Karazhan!! /sneer</div></div><hr />

This way he enters your raid even if you don't have a raid group. Only thing is, if he dies he has to release, leave, you release too, make raid, enter to revive, convert back to party, invite him back, resurrect him. He must wait as ghost (think corpse will teleport you out) and tada! Dunno, maybe you didn't know but it is possible to raid with up to 5 friends in any raid, using real id. But it's very nice they officially make it a feature, much easier! :P About classic dungeons, heroics, I've just had to run in with my friend manually (like old school) and we ended up in the same dungeon... so it's doable right now as well! :3</div></div><hr />

While its true that the current LFR system is cross realm it doesn't allow you to pre-select your group cross realm.<br />
<br />
Not sure if I'm understanding you correctly, but you can form your group with ppl from another servers before queueing for LFR. But you can only make a party, so no more than 5 members if you have someone from another server. The change will let you form a raid and make a group of more than 5 ppl between different servers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Form a cross-realm raid and use Raid Finder<br />
Jump in to any classic dungeon or raid and be automatically placed in the same instance<br />
Join forces and dominate the Battlegrounds<br />
<br />
<br />
Please note, you will not yet be able to run normal or Heroic Dragon Soul with cross-realm Real ID raids.<br />

1) that would be sweet, cept LFR already does that. so epic lul. <br />
2) that would be sweet. <br />
3) thats already in place. <br />

so... thanks for listing some crap that is ALREADY in the game. <br />

wtb cross realm arenas and rated bgs. <br />

why dont you implement something thats NOT in the game already. <br />

1) You can't make a raid with Real ID friends on other servers period, let alone queue for LFR. You can in a 5 man, but if you want to queue with more than 5 people, you can't bring cross-server friends.<br />
2) Yes<br />
3) Again, you can't group with more than 5 people if you have Real ID friends from other servers, so you cannot do this at the moment.<br />
<br />
Cross realm Arenas wouldn't work due to the battlegroups.<br />
<br />
They are implementing new things, you're just too much of a moron to grasp the simple concepts.<br />

No reason not to - neither side has any advantages anymore. Half of my friends play Alliance, the other half play Horde. To be able to get us all together for a raid would be completely epic.<br />
<br />
I've always wondered - why don't they allow the entire pool of players to queue for dungeons (alliance &amp; horde)? Honestly, the whole faction thing seems to be a non-event. Then again, I have distanced myself from the game as emotionally as I used to be.<br />

Fact, you can join in a GROUP with cross-realm friends, and in that group do BGs Dungeons and LFR, Fact, as of right now you can not turn that GROUP into a RAID, do you see what they are adding now? in the coming patch you can, where you can not now, make a raid group with cross-realm friends, and with that raid group do BGs non DS raids, and LFR, this allows you to bring more than 5 cross-realm, and sever friends together to do shit in the game, where previously you could not. this is a minor addition to the game that the server techs and realm ppl did, no development money was spent on it, there is literally no reason for anyone to be SUPER excited or pissed off about this addition.</div></div><hr />

Also now you can do it with more people at once, that's great but honestly if you have more than 4 real id friends you need to play with then you should probably reconsider your realm choise and transfer to them.<br />

You are only able to join level 81-85 normal/hc dungeons at level 85 with the current real ID party feature.<br />
Now you can join ANY classic dungeon/raid, BGs and form raids with real ID friends.<br />
My friends are spread out on many servers because they have other friends whom aren't my friends on them etc... so this is a welcome change for me!</div></div><hr />

-click &quot;raidfinder&quot;<br />

Collectively we're all great players, but for varying reasons we have either setup our own guilds (read bank slots) or are unfulfilled in others. This allows us to form our own raiding parties without the grief of spamming /trade nor linking achievements which many people deem necessary even to enter older content. Now, collectively, we can have our own raiding community. We'll still meet others in LFD (etc) and of course on our own servers; this will not kill local server communities as some detractors are saying.

The next feature will be cross realm guilds and some other stuff adding more to the Convenience factor to the game. The need for raiding guilds will diminish with time as the game goes more and more casual.

Broken? The game is seven years old and most of us have long had our fill of trying to but together groups to run dailies by advertising for it in trade, general an d the now dead lfg channel.

No, you were doing cross-realm party and queue for LFR. The new feature is cross-realm RAID and queue for LFR. Right now you can only do cross-realm LFR with 4 friends, in 4.3.2 you can do it with 24 friends.</div></div><hr />

The new feature is cross-realm RAID and queue for LFR. Right now you can only do cross-realm LFR with 4 friends, in 4.3.2 you can do it with 24 friends.<br />
<br />
Ah, thanks for the clarification :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I know Blizzard would catch a lot of flak for it, but they really should start merging low pop servers.<br />
<br />
Cross-realm activities are great if you are on a low pop server and want to see more action, but it doesn't address the issue that those realms have dying communities that have turned in to ghost towns.</div></div><hr />

Technically, it would be you and 39 other people, since that's the cap for raid groups, but since no group content is tuned for that, anymore, you are completely right. =P</div></div><hr />

Big deal. I could transfer now to said guild's server, buy the run through mount carry, and transfer back. All this does is make it cheaper.</div></div><hr />

I'm wondering what the effects will be on guild recruitments. <br />
Imagine : you don't have to pay for realm transfer to be able to raid with x, y or z guild that isn't on your realm. <br />
It's as if there is a single guild recruitment pool now for each region. <br />
Awesome.<br />

<br />
You're missreading.<br />
<br />
As of now you can't convert to a raid group. So only 5 people in a group, max. What they mean is that you're able to form a full raid group with people and queue together. I stumbled upon this issue so many times when 3 of my friends from another realm wanted to play, but I also had 3 guildies in my group...</div></div><hr />

As well as the ridiculously low drop rates of said items where even myself who tries to do at least 4 treatise runs a day sees 0 drops. I will end this fair without one despite putting forth literally hours into looking for one. Regarding drop rates, these items are dropping as-intended. They are rare&quot;They are not rare, i got every of the 3 PvP items in 1 WSG...Items from instances and raids dropped at first try aswell, so they cant call them &quot;rare&quot;.Or still farming for the &quot;A Treatise...&quot; myself, been farming for 3weeks, 3hours each day now... not 1 has dropped of those, something got to be wrong.</div></div><hr />

I love the LFR in my messed up work schedule that I can still see raid content even if it is watered down. Atleast WoW keeps me playing with LFR and if they implament it so we can see older content without having to Pug? Ogeeez!</div></div><hr />
