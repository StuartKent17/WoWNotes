Several of the developers came to chat after the Game Systems panel today. This did not appear on the Virtual Ticket.<br />
<br />

<br />
Artifacts<br />
<br />
All of the caster Artifact weapons that look they are 1H do have off-hands.<br />
The further you are behind on the Artifact as you go through the expansion, the easier it is to place new traits into your Artifact. It is pretty quick to get mostly caught up when switching specs. If you are trying to maintain off-specs you can do that to a certain degree. It only becomes a burden if you are trying to keep many specs all topped off at once. <br />
Alts will also have catch up mechanism for Artifacts.<br />
<br />
<br />
Raiding<br />
<br />
It used to be a bigger problem to have a melee heavy raid in the past. The problem isn't solved right now, but it is better than it used to be. Having lots of melee does make it a little harder to learn a new boss. The data shows that people switch specs more from melee to ranged than ranged to melee because of that perception. Melee does need to do more damage than ranged on Patchwerk style fights to deal with the problem. <br />
Timewalker raids are cool idea, but their time has not yet come. Maybe in the future. The team is talking about revisiting some of the old raids in a new way.<br />
The team is fixing the boss movement issues in Patch 6.2.3. Thank the engineers! <br />
<br />
<br />
Healing<br />
<br />
Healers should always have something to do. In Legion when you are doing group PvE content you will notice that you can do a lot more damage than you could before when you choose to spend globals and resources on it. When you are overgearing the content, the damage you do in your spare time will go from close to meaningless (now) to being a useful contribution to the raid (in Legion).<br />
You should be able to level as a healer, so when you are playing solo you should be able to do substantial damage. Druids having Thorns again will help, things attacking you will take substantial damage.<br />
Absorbs are a little bit less powerful, have longer cooldowns, and there are less of them in Legion. Paladins won't be causing absorb shields anymore, as their mastery has changed. Discipline mastery has also changed.<br />
<br />
<br />
Tanking<br />
<br />
Active mitigation is still a big part of what you do, but it went in too strong. If you messed up the active mitigation you died, so it mattered too much. <br />
Active mitigation should be designed to where the expert player can get more out of it but the newer player isn't awful. It is less about managing your resources and more about using the right button at the right time and the magnitude of the effects are going down a little bit. It is still a very large part of what tanks do. <br />
All of your long cooldowns like Shield Wall will count as if active mitigation is running while they are running. <br />
Tanks have buttons that give tank or offense functionality, but the team is tried to do more things that have both. If you are trying to DPS really hard as a tank, that should translate to being a good tank at the same time.<br />
Resolve is gone. The abilities that relied on it have been redesigned to not rely on it anymore. For Brewmaster, the active mitigation buttons either give you a gigantic Stagger buff or cleanse your Stagger. You want to use them in tandem. <br />
<br />
<br />
Misc<br />
<br />
People say that there is nothing to do in Warlords, but that isn't really true. There is nothing to do that gives a rewards that you care about. In Legion, the goal is to make the outdoor world, quests, dungeons, and raids all have things that you care about so that there are reasons to do them at max level.<br />
The transmog system will include old quests that have been removed. There is a chance a few quests were modified that shouldn't have been, but they will handle those on a per quest basis.<br />
<br />
<br />
Classes and Fantasy<br />
<br />
The team is putting a lot of focus into improving the fantasy of each class, so you really feel different, unique, and caught up in your class's fantasy. <br />
Visuals, animations, and sounds for many classes have also been improved.<br />
Survival, Shadow, Demonology, Subtlety, Combat, Discipline are all getting big changes.<br />
The team originally was going to keep the changes under control, but this ended up being one of the expansions with the most changes to classes after development got going.<br />
When we see the beta, players shouldn't look at balance yet. There hasn't been numbers tuning. Give feedback on the play style and fantasy instead. <br />
If a few classes are too strong, the team doesn't want to buff everyone else to that level because all of the encounters would have to be adjusted. Over the years they have tended to do this anyway, which makes older content easier and easier. The power inflation isn't great. <br />
Nerfs get a lot of attention and the buffs (which there are more of) don't get nearly as much attention. <br />
When every spec has something unique, distinct, and different that only they can do, it accentuates the idea that you are special to the world.<br />
There are enough numbers being rolled in combat that any RNG evens out, it is more about there being a little bit of unpredictability to respond to in combat. <br />
Lots of the major glyphs that are being removed are being added in to the core ability. <br />
<br />
<br />
Talents<br />
<br />
Currently there are a lot of rows that offer you three similar options to choose from, making it feel like it doesn't matter what you pick. This is going away by moving them into different rows, so you could take multiple mobility talents or multiple AoE healing talents. Really hardcore players may change their talents from encounter to encounter to get different capabilities. <br />
There will be more impactful talents. Rogues have five rows with straight throughput improvements. Every spec has four or five rows of straight throughput improvements.<br />
The additional spec specific talents help class fantasy and help to make them feel more impactful. In Legion around 2/3rd of the talents are spec specific.<br />
Some talent rows now have multiple types of talents rather than all of them being the same. For example, a row could have a new ability, proc, or passive rather than three new abilities. This lets you control how complex or simple your gameplay is. Fury is a good example, as the core rotation with no talents is very simple, but there are a ton of options for added engagement through talents. You can take five additional active abilities you would use in your rotation (not long cooldowns).<br />
The team will try to address the need to switch specs per encounter with talent choices. <br />
<br />

http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ideathknights.gif Death Knight (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/269-Death-Knight) / Skills (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/death-knight) / Talent Calculator (http://www.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#Y))<br />
<br />
Death Knights had a lot of balance changes over time. They had unique mechanics, like DoT snapshotting with Unholy. Those things have gone away now, so part of what made Unholy special is gone. <br />
Something they are trying now is Festering Wounds. When the Death Knight hits a target, they will apply debuff and when they use a different ability that wound will pop. You might hit them and apply three or five, or pop three of them all at once. <br />
The fantasy of a Death Knight pulling corpses from the ground to do their bidding is great, but in the game it doesn't feel like that when you are playing, so the team wanted to give them a unique mechanic. <br />
Talents may give them multiple pets, different pets, stronger pets. <br />
Frost is still very similar to live and Blood is somewhere in the middle. <br />
Blood Death Knights having the different rune types is part of what made it easy to play. You would just push whatever buttons were lit up, as the runes controlled what you could use. Now you will have more options and control over how to use your runes. <br />

<br />
Resto and Feral druids got minor changes.<br />
Moonkin is inspired by the current state of the spec, but is now a brand new spec. <br />
The current spec is based on a cycle of moving a bar back and forth on your UI. You are spending your time playing with the UI rather than the game. <br />
The moving back and forth on the bar is going away, replaced with abilities that build and spend a resource with different strengths and weaknesses. <br />
It should still hit the main Moonkin fantasy, as it is still heavy on DoTs, still has Moonfire, Sunfire, Starfall, and all of the unique Moonkin things.<br />
Innervate is returning, but not to Resto Druids. If they had it, they would want to use it on themselves, which isn't very interesting. <br />
Innervate is coming back to Balance Druids as their specific utility, so they won't have Stampeding Roar anymore. S<br />
tampeding Roar will be for Feral and Guardian only. <br />
A powerful single target version of Mark of the Wild is coming back for the Resto Druid cooldown. <br />
Rejuvenation in Cat Form is going away. <br />
Predatory Swiftness is staying. <br />
Feral isn't seeing a ton of changes, but they are getting lots of new talents. <br />
The base Druid has less skills from the other three roles, but there is a new talent row that allows you to pick Balance, Feral, Guardian, or Restoration, and get a whole suite of abilities for that role and it makes you actually good at it. You get much more than the watered down version you had before and you get to pick which one you are good at instead of okay at all of them. <br />
You could be a Guardian druid that switches to Cat form to do more damage when you aren't the active tank. You can also be a Moonkin, as if you take the Balance Affinity talent as Guardian, you get Moonkin form. <br />
<br />

<br />
Most Marksmanship hunters are taking the Lone Wolf talent on live, so the team decided to go ahead and remove the pet in Legion. You can still be ranged with a pet as Beast Mastery. <br />
Survival Hunters have lots of cool mechanics right now and many of them have become Marksmanship talents in Legion. <br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/images.gif Mage (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/272-Mage) / Skills (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/mage) / Talent Calculator (http://www.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#g))<br />
<br />
Frost and Arcane mages got minor changes.<br />
There is a Mage group that is very critical to influencing the course of Azeorth and directly fighting the Legion that is being reformed. They are getting a secret sanctum in Dalaran. <br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/imonks.gif Monk (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/341-Monk) / Skills (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/monk) / Talent Calculator (http://www.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#o))<br />
<br />
Storm, Earth, and Fire is supposed to make Windwalkers really good at three target damage, even when the targets aren't grouped up. <br />
Windwalker single target damage was a little bit too low for a while during Warlords, they brought it up some, but it is still not one of the best performers. <br />
The new Storm, Earth, and Fire is something they are doing to solve how hard it is to use the current version. <br />
Someone looks at the skill and doesn't understand how it works and decides they will figure it out later. This is bad because it is important to doing good damage as a Windwalker. <br />
The new Storm, Earth, and Fire is being simplified and made more intuitive. It will be a simple toggle, somewhat similar to Blade Flurry. <br />
You turn it on and split into three, turn it off and you recombine into one. They won't attack the same target as you, but they will find something nearby to attack. You do lose the customizability of assigning targets, but it will do something useful at all times. <br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ipriests.gif Priest (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/274-Priest) / Skills (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/priest) / Talent Calculator (http://www.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#U))<br />
<br />
The new Atonement mechanic is very different than the older ones. It is a mix of using damage and healing abilities to mark allies with a buff as you heal them and then heal those people as you damage enemies with Atonement spells, so you have to weave both together at all times. <br />
Discipline may be one of the more complex healers. <br />
Disc priest's endless PW:S spam had to go! It was bad for them and bad for everyone.<br />
Shadow Priests don't have Flash Heal or Heal anymore, but they do have Shadowmend, which is a new spell that is twice as good as Flash Heal in terms of how much it heals for, but over the next 10 seconds half of that heal fades away. If the target takes damage it comes off of the Shadowmend damage first, so if the target is constantly taking damage it is a really strong heal. <br />
Both Shadow and Discipline will have Shadowmend. <br />
Shadow will also keep PW:S.<br />
Holy priests used to have the biggest single heal in the game and the team wanted to move them back in that direction. <br />
Chakra is gone<br />
They redesigned the way the Holy Word: Serenity system works. <br />
Holy Word: Serenity is now the biggest single target heal in the game, it has a substantial cooldown but will heal roughly half of the health bar of the target. A crit would be a full heal. <br />
Holy also will have Prayer of Healing and Discipline will not. <br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/irogues.gif Rogue (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/275-Rogue) / Skills (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/rogue) / Talent Calculator (http://www.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#Q))<br />
<br />
Combat rogues felt very generic, so the name of the spec is changed to Outlaw.<br />
This gives a new direction for the class fantasy, drawing inspiration from movies with different types of outlaws. <br />
There is a column of pirate themed talents, such as cannonball barrages and grappling hooks.<br />
The team considered getting rid of Killing Spree, but sometimes rough edges are cool. It is now a talent, so you can take it or other AoE talents. It always ports you back to where you started now. <br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ishamans.gif Shaman (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/276-Shaman) / Skills (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/shaman) / Talent Calculator (http://www.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#c))<br />
<br />
Shamans have mana, but it doesn't do anything for them. Mana is gone unless you are a Restoration Shaman! It has been replaced with a new resource called Maelstrom. It is built up through using abilities and then used on certain abilities. It is somewhat similar to the Demon Hunter resource but themed for Shamans and what they do. <br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/iwarlocks.gif Warlock (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/277-Warlock) / Skills (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/warlock) / Talent Calculator (http://www.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#k))<br />
<br />
Demonology has gone really far off track from where the core fantasy is. <br />
The team looked at Demonology and took some inspiration from what exists today, but mostly started from scratch. <br />
Demonology is going to be completely different, which is going to require a lot of iteration and feedback from players. <br />
There is no way to enslave dreadlords permanently, but they have talked about a talent that lets your enslaved demon last longer or making it permanent, but there are significant balance concerns. <br />
It is much more focused on summoning demons and empowering them. <br />
You still use Shadow Bolt as a generator. <br />
Hand of Gul'dan is a spender which drops the meteor, but also summons one imp for every Soul Shard you spend on it, up to five. <br />
There is a rotational ability that summons a pair of new demons, Dreadstalkers. <br />
There is a new rotational Demonic Empowerment, that will buff the demons you have out, giving them a Bloodlust like buff. <br />
Lots of talents that summon demons as well, one makes Curse of Doom summon an imp when it pops. <br />
Another talent makes the Dreadstalkers you summon come with imps riding on them. <br />
No female Felguard in this expansion. Creating and animating new models is very expensive.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wrong. There IS a shit ton to do in WoD, but you need to find it and a lot of it doesn't necessarily translate to things you want to do. The end result is the same, which is that it doesn't feel like there is anything to do.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And simply being a meat shield with a lot of stats stacking to passively reduce the incoming damage for you isn't nice. I'm glad that AM gave us a way to be actively engaged in the game. I'm really afraid that they are gonna water it down by a lot, that's my main concern.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's still different. A class can be designed many ways and still fit the same core fantasy. There IS a difference, maybe it just sounds weird. Essentially it just means basic characteristics and philosophies, but that's pretty wordy.<br />
<br />
I agree it might be over used and is being turned into a bit of a buzzword, but the idea in general is one I very much agree with. Classes have lost their uniqueness and have become rather watered down over the years, so I'm glad to see them diversifying them a bit, finally. It makes specializations feel more like subclasses (like Warlocks or Mage), and less like slight tool adjustments (like Hunter).</div></div><hr />

<br />
I disagree. The new dungeon system is so much better, and I'm sure if the dungeons are fun and you are going up levels, you'll get excitement just from that, and at the end of the week you get a sweet piece of loot based on your best performance. This brings excitement and commitment back, something which has been lacking for the game since Cataclysm, right now the only commitments are the legendary ring and raiding.</div></div><hr />

Honestly, I'm starting to hate more and more things they're saying about Demonology since it's becoming a spec that gives you less and less control. <br />
Besides playing Demo for the fact you can have a decent amount of control over the gameplay, I played it for being able to become the demon now that it looks like both are going I really have no reason to play Demo anymore.</div></div><hr />

I'm assuming (Rather, hoping) that they skipped over warriors because so many changes are incoming that they want to make one of those class blogs about it, so we get the whole picture...<br />

Making content that's uninteresting into a loot pinata will certainly get people to play your game, but it doesn't make the content inherently better.<br />
<br />
It doesn't have to be one extreme or the other though. What you're doing is creating a false dichotomy. Blizz isn't saying they want to add loot pinatas. They are acknowledging that for people to do content, it requires rewards in some sense. Either the game just has to be crazy fun and thus it's &quot;rewarding&quot; to participate, or you need some extrinsic reward like valor points or gear or whatever.<br />
<br />
The fact is, that's always been the case. No one ran dungeons in Vanilla because they were fun. They ran them because that's where the gear was. And it was the only place. Molten Core wasn't the best raid #1 ever. It was the easiest place to get epic gear.</div></div><hr />

There are things to do...that were added a year ago that most people did already. Patches after release didnt add much unless you like raiding or killing rares.<br />
I totally skipped Tanaan cause killing rares isn't my thing. So i get to sit in my Garrison and wait for raid...doesn't sound like fun.<br />
<br />
I liked wod a lot till about a month into BRF then my fun decreased substantially. Not do to raids being bad but do to lack of other content. I was thrilled when mythic dungeon event week came along cause its something to get you out of your garrison for a few hours.

<br />
It;s the closest you'll get to an admission that they fucked up with WoD. It's a cop out - and a typical one for them. &quot;WE designed a good game, it's not our fault you didn't think it was worth playing it.&quot; That old arrogance is still there - but the changes are addressing the problem. It's like someone sat them down and said &quot;Look...what you like? Ain't fun. The sub numbers prove it. They've been telling you what they want for a year now. Give them what they want.&quot; <br />
<br />
The changes look interesting. Hopefully it all makes it into the game. My fear is, they're doing another class revamp, before they purposely disengaged from any expansion during TBC, because it was so much work. This might be the zone upgrade issue that strangled Cata - they'll get so swamped in redoing classes...something will suffer. Hopefully the expanded body count will help that. <br />
<br />
And yeah...paladins. I hate how they play now. It's not &quot;Imma go beat up that mob after blinding it with Holy Light&quot;, it's &quot;Imma go over there and play whack a mole with cool downs, and hope I connect with the mob.&quot; It's just..meh. I spent more time watching icons than the game. Overcomplicated, disengaged, not fun. Kind of like DKs when they first released...&quot;Wait...what is that icon again? I can do what now? Huh?&quot; Paladins are meat shields with big sticks and halos or should be. Instead, they're more complicated than warlocks. But who knows if they're getting addressed at all. &quot;We're fine with paladins where they are&quot; probably - because they probably don't know what the hell to do with them. Paladins should be having their shining moment in Legion, lore wise...but nobody is going to play them, it's going to be 4,999,999 Demon Hunters, and heals and tanks. <br />
<br />
I do like the change to rogues, but I'm unsure how rogues are going to carry cannons into combat...not very stealthy.</div></div><hr />

my problem was that the things they had to do the rewards very much did not match what you put into it, like why would I want to go out and catch several thousand fish in Draenor to get the angler achievement the only benefit of it was letting you get a tier 3 fishing hole in your garrison, that they had already stated you were not going to use after the expansion ended<br />

too much of their &quot;stuff to do&quot; just felt like time sink activities and what rewards there are were so minor, up until they added flying, that there was just no real point in doing them</div></div><hr />

I hate it because it creates false choice. If talent X is single target and Y multi-target, why not swap every time you have to deal with a multi-target boss? You aren't sacrificing single target damage for better AoE. Nope, you just swap talents and you're done. There's less consequences for your decision.

<br />
Sorry but I think it is not the case. My hobby is a 3D modeling. And It is really a not big deal to create a new model and animate it within a week or less. <br />
<br />
I think Blizz is just lazy. There was so much content in TBC and Wrath expansions. But since Cata the content is smaller and smaller and smaller. They want more money for less content. So to me this shows that they are lazy as hell. They have the biggest team in WoW history but giving us smaller and smaller expansions...</div></div><hr />

<br />
While I do agree that female felguards would be kind of a pointless effort, I don't think their excuse really holds up. They talk about new animations... Why? They always recycle animations and skeletons from other creatures to create new ones. The Direhorns were just boars with a new body, for instance. The Botani Forest-Menders are just male Night-Elves, the Draenic Constructs are just male Draeneis, etc. They wouldn't have to do any new animations for a female variant of a Felguard. They could probably just use a female Orc as a base.<br />
<br />
The argument that the new model would be time wasted on something else they could have created is a bit of a &quot;two sides of the coin&quot; type of thing. Look at Mists of Pandaria. They took time to create silk worms. They're rigged to the crocolisk skeleton, but still the model itself was entirely new. They appeared in only a few areas and were tamable by hunters. They were, ultimately, only beneficial to Hunters. How do you judge that this was a better time investment than another model? <br />
<br />
It's not like models in WoW are ever wasted, anyway. They can be used for years to come. Demons make a lot of sense. They're always included in every expansion, in some way. An expansion based on the Burning Legion was in fact the perfect time for Warlock demon variety, since they would have been able to use all those new models elsewhere in the content.<br />
<br />
They could have simply left it at &quot;Demons are not like humans, they don't need female counterparts&quot; and it would have been the end of it. There are no Incubus, no female Imps, no male Shivarrah, no female Dreadlords and Doomguards... Felguards don't need the distinction more than other demons do.</div></div><hr />

My hobby is a 3D modeling. And It is really a not big deal to create a new model and animate it within a week or less. <br />
<br />
I think Blizz is just lazy. There was so much content in TBC and Wrath expansions. But since Cata the content is smaller and smaller and smaller. They want more money for less content. So to me this shows that they are lazy as hell. They have the biggest team in WoW history but giving us smaller and smaller expansions...<br />
<br />
Hobbies are exactly that; hobbies. You cannot in any way or form compare that to the structure of major development firm with thousands of employees. Everything is planned down to the last detail, everything has a time schedule. And from the engineering panel that appeared on the frontpage, they even admit that the WoW team don't do agile development. That means they're incredibly rigid in their scheduling. You simply cannot just put another model in there.<br />
<br />
And for the record, it's not just making the model. It's making the artwork, the sketches, the mockups, the design meetings on agreeing on the final project, then making it, and testing it thoroughly in Q&amp;A, then bugfixing, then testing it in Q&amp;A again. This takes time. If my memory still serves me somewhat faithfully, they said in one of the design blogs for either Mists or Warlords that a model takes around a month to make from start to finish.</div></div><hr />

The utility that provides for the raid is immense. Not happy with any of the Druid changes to be honest. It's all BS. &quot; The base Druid has less skills from the other three roles, but there is a new talent row that allows you to pick Balance, Feral, Guardian, or Restoration, and get a whole suite of abilities for that role and it makes you actually good at it. You get much more than the watered down version you had before and you get to pick which one you are good at instead of okay at all of them.&quot; What does this even mean, this sentence really doesn't make any sense whatsoever.<br />
<br />
When we had HoTW, it was shit because say if I was balance and going to heal, I only had rejuv and HT. With the affinity talent they're thinking of doing, I'll be able to actually offheal when damage isnt needed by talenting into a set of resto spells, or I could tank and go Balance affinity to gain spells to damage when I'm not tanking. Currently we only have 2-3 spells from the other 3 specs, versus having a wide array of them in the previous expansions. They're going back to the previous expansions.</div></div><hr />

love it, love it, love<br />
For Wod, the questing experience was a blast. <br />
As for dungeons and raids, you can't really change the dynamics that much - it's a bit of a borefest for me but i understand this game needs to cater to everyone. <br />
I don't understand how i can spend weeks and months in azeroth grinding away in archaeology for a particular mount but can't be bothered doing a dungeon/raid once a daily, let a alone week.</div></div><hr />

They say here that maelstrom is a &quot;new&quot; system so we're going to need more information before we can say for sure, but if its just lazily carried over from enhancement it'll be a disaster.

Well, look at the sub count. It's half of what it was in WotLK, so ofc they can only put out half as much at best.<br />
I think they got greedy going into cata and made so many silly changes which resulted in a very bland and generic experience, they gained some new people but in the process began losing many of their core veteran players, resulting in pretty much half or even less of what they were making.<br />
<br />
That's not to say their profit margin was halved, but much lower since anything they made over 8 mil was a surplus, but now they can't even hit 5.5 mil, so to keep themselves at a profit, they either got new and less experienced people so they only needed to pay them a fraction of that they pay others, or they are lying about the whole &quot;we have more people working on WoW than ever before&quot;- and this can be true but still dishonest, like they might have 100 more people working on it, but those 100 people only dedicate 5% of their time on WoW and 95% of it on other games.<br />
<br />
Either way, get used to less and less content, as it doesn't look like WoW can retain many people sine most of the players they have left are fair weather fans that get the xpac, play for a month, and then unsub again.</div></div><hr />

I laughed in real life. Proving once again that they need real PR that won't let them say things like that. That's just going to be taken as insulting to the player base, no other way to look at it.

The thing is. As you can see I play alot of other MMOs. And for the first time in the history of wow. People on other MMOs that are there while wow has no content are talking about NOT going back. Normally almost all talk about going back when the expansion comes out. However now for the first time ever they are all talking about NOT going back.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LeeTaeRyeo</div><div class="date">2015-11-09, 01:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't like the idea of Demonology using Soul Shards. Unless they decide to make it something you can control the generation of via shadow bolt (or maybe soul fire). Affliction's still a pretty basic spec but I still hate soul shards when playing it because they're not very convenient.<br />
<br />
Honestly, I'm starting to hate more and more things they're saying about Demonology since it's becoming a spec that gives you less and less control. <br />
Besides playing Demo for the fact you can have a decent amount of control over the gameplay, I played it for being able to become the demon now that it looks like both are going I really have no reason to play Demo anymore.<br />
<br />
Historically speaking, though, soul shards were the primary resource (outside of mana) for all warlocks. Summoning any demon other than an imp took a soul shard. Creating a soulstone (or creating the buff after they changed it from being an item) took a soul shard. Creating healthstones, spellstones, enslaving demons, even casting soul fire took a soul shard. So, having soul shards be the main secondary resource is fairly reasonable. They have stated that shadow bolt will be a generator for soul shards.<br />
<br />
The issue with metamorphosis is that it really had no reason to be part of the class. Demonology is all about making pacts with demons and using their powers. A demonologist is supposed to flirt with demonic power, yet stay just far enough away that it doesn't consume them (like what happens to Kanrethad in the green fire quest line). It makes perfect sense to remove that ability and roll it over into the Demon Hunter, as that is the class it should belong to. Demon hunters literally become part demon. Demonologists just make pacts with demons. That's the core issue here. Metamorphosis should never have been part of demonology.<br />
<br />
Personally, I really like this shift towards summoning. I think it suits the spec well. You have one DoT spec, one burst spec and now one pet spec. It makes sense from a gameplay and lore standpoint.</div></div><hr />
