<br />
The Heartbreaker (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/50471/the-heartbreaker/) on use effect just makes your character cry. The Toxic Wasteling (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/71840/toxic-wasteling/) seems to have a couple of abilities (http://db.mmo-champion.com/search/all/toxic_wasteling/#tab=spell) and might be an interesting pet!<br />
<br />
According to the Big Love Rocket (http://db.mmo-champion.com/a/4627/big-love-rocket/) achievement, Apothecary Hummel also drops the Big Love Rocket Mount (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/71342/big-love-rocket/)<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
Strategy<br />
<br />
The fight might be confusing the first time but isn't that hard (to give you an idea, I could heal it without too much problem with a rare-geared shaman alt that I rarely play). <br />
<br />
The Standard Apothecary Serving Kit (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/49631/standard-apothecary-serving-kit/) contains two potions :<br />
<br />
Cologne Neutralizer (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/49352/cologne-neutralizer/) makes you immune to Apothecary Baxter's attacks / green clouds.<br />
Perfume Neutralizer (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/49351/perfume-neutralizer/) makes you immune to Apothecary Hummel's attacks / purple clouds. <br />
<br />
The radius of the <br />
Alluring Perfume (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/68641/alluring-perfume/) and <br />
Irresistible Cologne (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/68946/irresistible-cologne/) is fairly small, the player tanking each Baxter uses the Cologne Neutralizer (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/49352/cologne-neutralizer/) and the one tanking Hummel uses the Perfume Neutralizer (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/49351/perfume-neutralizer/), making them pretty much immune to most of the damage they deal. <br />
<br />
Apothecary Frye should be tanked by your main tank, he doesn't have any auras but will throw vials of perfume and cologne on the group. The easy way to handle it for DPS / Healers is just to pick an immunity at the beginning of the fight and just stay in the clouds they're immune to, if you feel like keybinding your potions you can just change your buff everytime the cloud color changes.<br />
<br />
Make sure the apothecaries are tanked back to the group, their <br />
Alluring Perfume Spray (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/68607/alluring-perfume-spray/) and <br />
Irresistible Cologne Spray (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/68948/irresistible-cologne-spray/) will hurt your group pretty badly if they are facing the raid. <br />
<br />
Crazy Apothecaries will also spawn throughout the encounter, they do not hurt a lot but will eventually suicide with <br />
Unstable Reaction (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/68957/unstable-reaction/) and deal some damage, they are a minor annoyance and most of the time you will probably just ignore them. <br />
<br />
As long as you understood the tanking basics and if your group can avoid clouds or switch their immunities on time, the fight is pretty straightforward and it won't take long to kill all 3 bosses. <br />

1 tank and 2 dps maybe possible ....<br />
<br />
We wiped hard on this tank kept him towards the raid all the time ... and healer stood in the poison all 5 times and each time said he didnt knew its his first time etc ....<br />
<br />
Damn and i thought pve tac &quot; MOVE FROM FIRE&quot; was easy ... dumbest start ever 2/5 times managed to kill him . hopefully next days ppl get more clue about it ... <br />
<br />
also with all teleports or dungeon insta teleport inside people got so dumb and fucking lasy ....<br />
<br />
Tooked me 10 mins to make 2 move while i spamed trade for last pers healer .... 10 minutes !!! i said ill go if someone else can get a healer but noooo ....<br />
<br />
2 go there (me one of them after 10 mins with healer found) and a idiot goes in crystal song for daily .... And ppl whining for a sumon , when they had like 15 min to reach it which would take like 2 mins , maybe less i offered to portal them to uc ...<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Likely not, there's a good chunk of aoe damage. Though maybe with a paladin tank or dps who can heal.</div></div><hr />

Ok, i managed to find the rocket mount myself from a booster pack so i didnt pay for it individually. But think about the people who bought it from Ebay or such.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Noddie</div><div class="date">2010-02-07, 09:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The mentioned strategy here is perhaps the most silly I've ever read. (Sorry). So here's how I did it last night:<br />
<br />
Step 1: Tank picks up the first two mobs to become active, ignores the potion throwing one since he will run around throwing potions at people and generally reset threat anyway. <br />
<br />
Step 2: With good dps the first mob will be dead by the time the third activates, so dont worry too much about colours of pots<br />
<br />
Step 3: Kill the mobs in the order they activate<br />
<br />
Step 4 (optional): Chugging pots in order to stay in puddles the same color seems very very over complicated, how about just stepping out of the puddle since there will be plenty of room to do so? <br />
<br />
Our pug healer failed to find his pots, and he had no problem at all staying alive. <br />
<br />
Also, the Oozling grows by eating critters for a totall of 3 growths. It finds one, jumps it and eats it alive. Even works on Sheep ^^</div></div><hr />

Why do people automatically jump to the assumption that a person has no ife if they have more than 1-2 lv80's?<br />

You can go from 1-80 in about 3-4 weeks of playing an hour a day or so, so how does having more 80's than that mean you have no life?</div></div><hr />

Meh i hate retards :/// sorry for off topic rage<br />
<br />
Yeah TOTALLY. I hate that freaking teleport.<br />
<br />
I only needed the Rose thing from UK for the achievement that I didn't get last year so I found someone gathering a group to go farm normal UK for the roses for the whole group. Well we were 4 people, rogue (leader), me hunter, elemental shaman (who was gonna heal if need), and a DK that was a dps.<br />
<br />
Well this leader wanted the last spot for a tank so that we could teleport to instance with the dungeon finder. I was like wtf, we can just 4man it if we fly to UK. No he didn't want to fly, instead he probably would have waited 1 hour for a tank rather than fly there in 2 mins.<br />
<br />
Well then I got leader and we invited another hunter and I said to the DK that mark your role as Tank so we can teleport, he failed to do that 4 times and reason was &quot;i'm not a tank&quot; :) it was a god damn normal UK who cares when all we want is a teleport to the instance.<br />
<br />
Damn I hate that teleport shit.<br />
<br />
Anyways, I kinda don't like that they changed the seasonal event so much. Theres no more wearing perfume and going at the guards etc. Just find a nice place to kill lots and lots of mobs for the tokens.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
We 3 manned it first try: Screenshot (http://danielgovier.com/wowpics/tirion_tough_love.jpg)<br />
<br />
Then our healer handed in the quest with Hummel thinking that was the 'end', only to start the event again when we were all oom etc :P</div></div><hr />

i think they would have to offer somenthing useful/interesting for these events:)<br />
<br />
the cost of travel to sfk is too high:p</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Scratchee</div><div class="date">2010-02-08, 10:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That mount is just too awsome. Any news on the drop rate? It must be even lower than the Headless Horseman's mount.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">leaki</div><div class="date">2010-02-09, 08:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A tank isn't actually necessary for this!<br />
<br />
One dps takes care of Hummel wearing the purple neutraliser, everyone else uses the green.<br />
<br />
Two dps stand on Baxter and take care of him, and the fourth ranged dps takes care of Frye as he runs round like a headless chicken. <br />
<br />
When Hummel and Baxter start casting 'Chain Reaction' just stand away &gt; 5 yards and move back in after the bang... DO move back in straight afterwards - Hummel runs around if he doesnt have someone stepping on his toes.<br />
<br />
We've done this with Mage, Lock, Boomy, Cat, Rogue, DK, Priest 'tanks' with no real problems. <br />
<br />
Everyone stays out of poison pools of opposite colour to themselves, just to make it easy on the healer. Ignore the Crazed Apothecaries entirely.<br />
<br />
We had a nice druid healer with us, and none us were especially well geared - with GS's between 3.5k and 5.3k.<br />
<br />
No sign of a mount yet though - but we have managed a handful of pets and a few of the blue novelty items.<br />
<br />
Enjoy :)</div></div><hr />
