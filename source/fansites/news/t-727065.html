Honor/Badges Cap<br />
We don't limit honor per week, but we do cap it. In the same way we won't limit the hero points per week that you can earn from heroic dungeons. We do limit the arena points you can gain per week (called conquest points in Cataclysm since you can earn them from rated BGs) as we limit the number of valor points -- the Frost equivalent that you earn from raids. In short, the upper tier is harder to earn and more prestigious to own, but once the tier advances you can quickly catch up to the first tier while the second one becomes the new high-end goal.<br />
<br />
Technically the Frost badges are limited per week right now, it's just that the cap is set to max number possible. In Cataclysm, the cap will be lower than the max number possible so you have some decisions about how to earn those points rather than having to do everything.<br />
<br />
Lower tier -- no cap per time, but an overall cap. In LK: Honor (PvP) and Triumph (PvE). In Cataclysm: Honor (PvP) and Heroism (PvE).<br />
Upper tier -- cap per time. In LK: Arena points (PvP) and Frost (PvE). In Cataclysm: Conquest (PvP) and Valor (PvE). (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25399741109/why-does-blizz-want-us-to-raid-less/))<br />

Amount of gear in 10/25-Player raids<br />
Me: &quot;We're going to try instead offering more rewards (which includes loot) in the 25s, especially for the heroic modes.&quot;<br />
<br />
The heroic 25 will drop more armor, weapons and tier-piece tokens per player than the heroic 10. The normal 25 will drop more badges per player than the normal 10, and it might drop more armor and weapons as well. Legendaries would most likely be both 10 and 25. We don't want a player to have to say &quot;I prefer running 10s, but now I feel like I have to run 25s to get a specific item.&quot; If they say &quot;I prefer running 10s, but now I feel like I have to run 25s to gear up faster,&quot; well, tough. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25399741109/why-does-blizz-want-us-to-raid-less/))<br />
<br />
[...] Imagine those ratios were reversed and a 10 dropped 1.2 items per raid (1 per 8.3 players) and a 25 dropped 5 per raid (1 per 5 players). Now the 25 is more efficient. It's more complicated than that because you might have more competition for a powerful drop in 25s, while you might shard more loot in 10s because the target class / spec isn't present. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25399741109/why-does-blizz-want-us-to-raid-less/))<br />
<br />
Cataclysm Legendary<br />
I don't know the details because we probably won't do a legendary for the first tier, but we would definitely not want a structure such that a 25 guild felt like the fastest way to finish the item was to run multiple 10s. If the 25s could finish it first, that would be fine. The 10s would still be able to get the item, which is not possible today. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25399741109/why-does-blizz-want-us-to-raid-less/))<br />
<br />
Benefits of 25-Player raids<br />
Your assumption here is that there is some magic tipping point at which a 10 dude wouldn't feel compelled to run a 25 and a 25 dude wouldn't feel stupid for not running a 10. That number may in fact exist, but it may be very hard to hit. I will tell you that we had to go to a whole tier of gear to make the heroics feel like they were worth doing.<br />
<br />
The stereotypical hardcore 25 guild (and I used &quot;stereotypical&quot; specifically because I'm not sure how meaningful it is to try and talk about a typical guild) is very concerned with efficiency. They want to get the final boss killed as quickly as possible and gear up everyone quickly. They feel a sense of accomplishment in doing things quickly. Thus we hope the benefit of gearing up more quickly by doing 25s is enough to keep them doing 25s. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25399741109/why-does-blizz-want-us-to-raid-less/))<br />
<br />
10-Player Heroic Gear = 25-Player Heroic Gear<br />
Yes. The exact same loot tables, but more rolls on those tables for the larger raids, particularly 25 heroic. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25399741109/why-does-blizz-want-us-to-raid-less/))<br />
<br />
Journey through all the raid tiers in TBC<br />
The problem is that journey was not made by many players (and I'm talking about interested players, not those with no interest in raiding). For everyone who progressed through all of those tiers, a huge percentage of players dropped out along the way, possibly just from the time commitment before they finally got to see the exciting new stuff that everyone was talking about. It might have worked okay for very tight-knit guilds with very stable rosters, but it was a hassle for other guilds who had to go do farming runs just to gear up one or two new players or alts before they could get back into progression. Again, it was more content to have to go back and do old zones, but I'm not sure it was fun content.<br />
<br />
We want raiding players, in general, to be able to see the final content. If Icecrown was being used by 10% or less of the raiding population then not only is it pretty hard to justify all of the production time it takes to make a raid, but it also feels to players who don't finish the journey like they don't get to see the climax of the story. Game designers, at least in this day and age, actually want players to finish their games, not drop out somewhere along the way when things get too tedious and difficult. (If you like difficult, that's what heroic modes are for. If you like tedious, well I guess try to get the Insane in the Membrane achievement.) (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25399741109/why-does-blizz-want-us-to-raid-less/))<br />
<br />
Skill vs. Gear<br />
If you want to know a little secret, part of the reason we can't use gear as a barrier to entry any longer is because the skill of the raiding population has grown so dramatically. The guilds who got the first kills in Icecrown probably could have done it with gear from a couple of tiers prior (with the possible exception of heroic LK). Skill trumps an enormous amount of power from gear. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25399741109/why-does-blizz-want-us-to-raid-less/))<br />
<br />
Raid content accessibility<br />
You're asking for us to spend an inordinate amount of our development time on a very small portion of our player base. That might work for an instance as easy to develop as Molten Core. It won't work for Ulduar. Making raids only for the top 2% is hard to justify when we're sitting there looking at a long feature list trying to decide what features we want to do for Cataclysm and what has to wait. The equivalent would be saying &quot;This is the Survival hunter expansion. We're going to spend a huge chunk of our development time on Survival hunters. If you don't play a hunter, sorry, but please buy our expansion anyway.&quot; Your strategy should actually be welcoming as many players as possible into raids -- that's what allows us to keep spending so much time and effort on them. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25399741109/why-does-blizz-want-us-to-raid-less/))<br />
<br />
Keeping old content alive and challenging<br />
I'm not sure you feel this way, but typically the response is &quot;I walked uphill in the snow, so they should have to as well.&quot; You got to the content first. You were showing off your tier set and Shadowmourne in Dalaran before those others guys. Why does it matter if they will eventually be able to catch up to you (especially since you'll pull ahead again the second a new raid is available)? The alternative is saying that those players should want to run through every raid tier before they can hit the new stuff, but I can tell you that whether or not they want to (and many don't) the facts suggest that they never finish and give up on raiding.<br />
<br />
We're not really trying to keep Black Temple or Sunwell alive at this point, and by the same token, we're okay if Naxx has basically been reduced to achievements or weekly raid quests. It had its time in the sun. We don't need to prop it up forever. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25399741109/why-does-blizz-want-us-to-raid-less/))<br />

Hmmm, what would be the case scenario for this, say a guild ran a 25 man run of WotA and then due to member dropout issues had to split the raid to 2x10's. Would the loot table change dramatically, what I mean is: if the next boss were to drop a Legendary could it drop twice due to there now being 2 raid groups or only once since it started as a 25 so it's programmed to only drop once.?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, to preface my response you need to understand that a portion of your question is invalid as 'legendaries' no longer drop from raids (like in the case of the TBC legendaries). They are a longish quest-chain that can only be completed within the raid (both 10 &amp; 25 come Cata).<br />
<br />
Now that that aspect of the discussion is cleared, let's look at the rest:<br />
1. 25man raid --&gt; split into 2 (upto 3) 10man raids. [Here either only 20 ppl can continue with the same raid or 5 more people need to be found to complete the 3rd group.]<br />
2. 25man raid: drops X loot per boss and Y badges. 10 man raid: drops X - n loot per boss and Y - m badges, where (X - n) &lt; X and (Y - m) &lt; Y.<br />
[NOTE: the (X - n) &amp; (Y - m) denote a lowering of loot by a fixed constant, but the formula could just as well be percentage based: (nX) &amp; (mY), where m is between 0 (exclusive) and 1 (exclusive). Regardless of how simplistic or complex the actual formula gets, the relation between the left and right sides remains unaffected and therefore the actual formula can be ignored or replaced with an easier to read one]<br />
<br />
if split into 2 10man raids, the entire raiding group gets upto 2 x (X - n) loot and 2 x (Y - m) badges.<br />
[NOTE: there are 5 fewer people in the raid(s) here compared to the 25man raid, so contention for loot is somewhat lowered]<br />
- To balance this blizzard only needs to ensure that <br />
a) 2 x (X - n) &lt; X or (2X - 2n) &lt; X<br />
and the same for badges<br />
b) 2 x (Y - m) &lt; Y or (2Y - 2m) &lt; Y<br />
<br />
Similarly, if split into 3 10man raids, the raiding group gets upto 3 x (X - n) loot and 3 x (Y - m) badges.<br />
[NOTE: there are 5 additional people in the raid(s) here compared to the 25man raid, so contention for loot is somewhat increased]<br />
- To balance this blizzard only needs to ensure that <br />
a) 3 x (X - n) &lt; X or (3X - 3n) &lt; X<br />
and the same for badges<br />
b) 3 x (Y - m) &lt; Y or (3Y - 3m) &lt; Y<br />
<br />
Summary:<br />
At most, blizzard need to ensure that [(3X - 3n) &lt; X] &amp; [(3Y - 3m) &lt; Y] hold to ensure that more gear drops in 25mans than in 10mans, regardless of splitting.<br />
NOTE: the same effect is achieved by calculating loot dropped on a per person basis and ensuring the per person capita of loot is higher for 25s v/s 10s.</div></div><hr />

I do, too. I feel like it'll be like TBC raiding, but even better. I co-lead and coordinated raids back then and it'll be nice to turn raiding from the glorified shard-and-badge grind it is now to something flexible and effective no matter which approach to the instance you take.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As it said very clearly in the post, things have their time in the sun, and when that time's over... that time's over. Few people enjoyed doing Karazhan over and over. If instances didn't 'rot' after a few months, people would get burned out on seeing the same crap every single week after 6 or more months.<br />

b) 2 x (Y - m) &lt; Y or (2Y - 2m) &lt; Y<br />
<br />
Similarly, if split into 3 10man raids, the raiding group gets upto 3 x (X - n) loot and 3 x (Y - m) badges.<br />
[NOTE: there are 5 additional people in the raid(s) here compared to the 25man raid, so contention for loot is somewhat increased]<br />
- To balance this blizzard only needs to ensure that <br />
a) 3 x (X - n) &lt; X or (3X - 3n) &lt; X<br />
and the same for badges<br />
b) 3 x (Y - m) &lt; Y or (3Y - 3m) &lt; Y<br />
<br />
Summary:<br />
At most, blizzard need to ensure that [(3X - 3n) &lt; X] &amp; [(3Y - 3m) &lt; Y] hold to ensure that more gear drops in 25mans than in 10mans, regardless of splitting.<br />
NOTE: the same effect is achieved by calculating loot dropped on a per person basis and ensuring the per person capita of loot is higher for 25s v/s 10s.<br />
<br />
<br />
Just like changing a 10 or 25 man raid into a heroic in LK, the boss just changes it's loot basically grabbing a new loot bag when the raid changes<br />
<br />
So lets say the 25 man looses 5 people<br />
<br />
They split into 2 10 mans <br />
<br />
2 separate raids, the bosses just change their loots to 10 man from 25 man<br />
<br />
That in simple terms what your trying to say :P <br />
<br />
Nice maths skillz tho o.o props! :)</div></div><hr />

If you want to know a little secret, part of the reason we can't use gear as a barrier to entry any longer is because the skill of the raiding population has grown so dramatically. The guilds who got the first kills in Icecrown probably could have done it with gear from a couple of tiers prior (with the possible exception of heroic LK). Skill trumps an enormous amount of power from gear. (Source)<br />
<br />
Eh, no? It's because of all those addons called DBM, BigWigs, AVR, that AVR-wannabe addon that uses your screen as a top-down map instead of the 3d world (forgot the name) and all the like.<br />
<br />
This is why any scrub can clear Icecrown nowdays, but not Naxx pre-TBC.</div></div><hr />

Why do you have to do old raids in order to learn?<br />
Why do people even need to visit Malygos for the tactics if it's old content that doesn't drop anything?<br />
I don't see why you can't just train people in ICC, or whatever the most recent raid is. <br />
If you are a good teacher you will be able to get your players to an appropriate standard anyway, and if they refuse to learn you can just replace them.</div></div><hr />

I'm not sure what your statement here is. Are you saying that because people failed at it, it should be made harder? Because that sounds rather silly.<br />
<br />
If you fail T7 content in T9-10, then that isn't the game's fault. It is the players'. And honestly, you should be able to 5 man Malygos considering the huge gear gap.</div></div><hr />

I don't get this attitude. If you need more incentive to keep running 25 man, then obviously you don't really like 25 man. You say people do 10 mans because they are lazy (I don't see what's lazy about not having 24 other people available at the same time to raid, but alas..) and people do 25 mans because of gear. Who plays for fun then? <br />
<br />
If people all choose to do 10 man instead of 25, no matter what their reason is, and you still want 25 man, you are the minority. Business wise there is no reason to cater to the minority. Find a guild of people that like 25 man also and raid with them. If 25 man really dies, Blizzard made a good decision by offering the same rewards in 10 man, because everyone only did 25 man for loot, which is not fun.<br />
<br />
I actually prefer 10 man over the 25 man chaos (always 2 people who screw up, 3 who do 1k dps and 1 on follow...), no matter what loot I get there. I welcome this change. The only difference between 25 and 10 is the logistics of getting 24 or 9 other people to play with you at the same time. Logistics should not be rewarded. It's a game, doing stuff ingame should be rewarded (like better loot in heroic raids), not doing stuff outside of the game. I have enough logistic challenges in my work, I don't need them in game.</div></div><hr />

More loot? Faster?! <br />
Progress and gearing up in small guilds will be much easier and faster! :/ <br />
<br />
It's all about LOGISTICS and CONVENIENCE.<br />
<br />
For 10ppl raiding you need 10-12 ppl in guild. There’s no real rotation, no stand-by ppls. Easy and funny raiding, no stress with „omg slackerz!, doh where are ours healers! etc.”<br />
Atm most of large guilds need 35+ ppl for effective raiding = less loot per 1 raider. More complications with logistics, MUCH MORE.<br />

Why do players rund heroics endlessly? Because it is soooooo much fuuuuuun? No. They do it because you get a lot for the work/time/effort you put in.<br />
<br />
At most, 30% of the players have ever killed a level 80 raid boss. AT MOST. Only 75% of these 30% have killed Marrowgar, 33% have killed a wing end boss (thats 10% of the player base!) and only 12% of them downed Arthas. All with the buff being in effect. I bet you 100 bucks that Arthas will be not be killed by significantly more players than Yogg-Saron did (10.000 at wowprogress.com) although the whole raid was a lot easier. <br />
<br />
Most people simply don´t care about raiding and they don´t care about story. And most of the 30% that killed a raid-boss (keep in mind, one Toravon kill and you are alreay in that group without ever having set foot in any other raid) care about the &quot;item per effort/time/work&quot;-factor. Endgame raid-content has always been for only a very very small part of the population and that has NOT changed despite Blizzards efforts.<br />
<br />
They´d be better of realizing that and actually creating content for the other 70% of the players...</div></div><hr />

<br />
No one can clear Naxx pre-TBC, because it doesn't exist anymore... and even when it was current content a majority of the WoW population never saw it nor cleared it, does that make them scrubs?<br />
<br />
But, no, not &quot;any scrub&quot;, actually what is your definition of a scrub? Do I fall into your definition? My main is a Death Knight, I raid 9 hours a week, sometimes 12 if I make my guild's Sunday raid. I only play maybe 15 hours a week. I'm 10/12 ICC 25 Heroic. I mean you can check my armory in the link below if you want more. So, a scrub is someone who doesn't put in as much time as you? They don't stay on MMO-Champ or EJ? What is the big deal that the someone gets to see the same content you see? Their experience and fun should not take yours away.

<br />
From my understanding you cannot run two different 10mans out of one 25man raid since they will share the same lockout (RaidID : 123456789 - 25m run becomes RaidID : 123456789 - 10m run) you only change the number and difficulty.<br />

Yes, the population has grown, and thus more inexperienced people play nowdays, but you have the option to play with your friends, which should either do good enough or is time to find some other friends in game. It's your own choise to play with idiots so stop blaming blizzard, they are just making money and offering you entertainment. If you don't like it, quit it and stop making drama.<br />
<br />
Yes, alot of content was dumbed down, part for making it most part of the game available for masses for the entertainment, part becuase you outgear it, but that's why you were given hardmodes. Don't tell me all of you who QQ just 1 shot hardmode bosses as they were shipped with the appropriate gear (not talking 10s using 25s gear).<br />

It's not hard to learn how to raid.....it never has been......please shut up :) go play in a busy road and take your elitism with you ^^! <br />
<br />
True raider?, lol people who learn how to raid and have the time to raid all day every day aren't true raiders just people with time, there are no &quot;true&quot; raiders. It depends on the people you play with. Raiding requires group work, you need a group of people, with skill. A lot of people do have skill now like GC said, if there are idiots, don't play with them, flame them, and they'll never learn :D<br />
<br />
Why can't casual people have skill? or enjoy raiding?, i bet there are casuals with better skill than you &quot;hard core&quot; raiders, but at the end of the day there casual for a reason. Like i said, take your elitism and shove it up your arse :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
While others are QQing.. I am ecstatic about 10's having access to top gear... as are a LOT of serious, skilled peeps. Maybe we only makeup 20% of the &quot;serious&quot; raiding population that's still playing... but who are you gonna fill those 5 seats in your raid... when we leave to start/join serious progression driven 10 man guilds?<br />
<br />
MANY 25 man guilds will breakup over this... because while it's easy to SAY &quot;Don't recruit idiots&quot;... it's much harder in practice when ALL that there is left are the inexperienced, casual players.<br />
<br />
ANYONE that says there is a pool of experienced peeps to recruit from is full of shit.<br />
<br />
So with only 20 peeps// what you gonna do? Recruit the inexperienced peeps... or just sit there and wait for 5 skilled peeps to &quot;poooof&quot; out of thin air...<br />
<br />
Oh I know.. split in to two 10 man teams... &quot;fixed&quot;<br />
<br />
25 man will become the new &quot;casual&quot; raids... the ones getting pugged because more peeps can be carried and get more lootz/badges... First 2-3 bosses killed then it disbands.. while the 10's clear each week and get &quot;more gearz&quot;, server firsts and nearly ZERO drama.<br />

<br />
Has NOTHING to do with raiding 30 hours + per week... unless THAT is what you comitted to.<br />
<br />
And finally... it's being able to stand in the fire once... seeing it's bad, and adjusting so that you don't do it again.<br />

<br />
The word &quot;Casual&quot; has a lot bad stigma attached that is unfair.<br />
<br />
Of COURSE casuals can be some of the most highly skilled players... they simply either cannot or choose not to play the game any more than they do. NOTHING wrong with that at all.<br />
<br />
But a &quot;casual&quot; softball player doesn't join a team that plays in a league... they may get a game together every once in a while.. and that suits them. Because they cannot or do not want to COMMIT to showing up to practice 3 times a aweek and game 2 times a week.<br />
<br />
Then you have the &quot;Wannabe's&quot; The peeps that are SOOO excited about raiding... they push and grind and research and such... they raid their asses off and they are pretty good. But after getting mostly geared up... they kinda lose interest and get bored... they &quot;got their gearz&quot; and wow... playing Xbox with Joe sound more fun than raiding tonight with the guild. Eventually they drop out of the guild.. and your guild has to try and gear up ANOTHER person.<br />
<br />
Then you have the inexperienced peeps... Peeps who may VERY well become committed team players... but simply lack the skills/experience to be of benefit to the team.. at least for some time. If they show initiative you may kite them thru raids to gear them... but without consistent Heroics and raiding they will not skillup very quickly.<br />
<br />
And lastly you have people who are truly inept. No matter HOW much they or you try.. they do not have the where-with-all to develop the skills and situational awareness to become a contributing raid member.<br />
<br />
<br />
That leaves us with the &quot;True&quot; or &quot;serious&quot; raider. Who simply is the hobbyist. Raiding in WoW is their hobby. WHen you are into a hobby.. you incorporate it into your life... you read magazines and websites, watch videos, makes plans to get equipment and practice diligently. You think about it form time to time when not in game.<br />
<br />
There is nothign elitist about me or the above viewpoints. I am simply stating the fact that hobbyists are becoming few and far between... and that in Cataclysm they will tend to reorganize and clump together to share their hobby with likeminded peeps.</div></div><hr />

THIS. A million times over.<br />
<br />
If you haven't done Malygos at this time, it could either be because of one of these 2 reasons:<br />
<br />
You semi-recently dinged 80. I mean in the Trial of the Crusader days. (Most likely, its like everything below Icecrown Citadel is now obsolete and no-one can be arsed to run them anymore.)<br />
You've been in bad groups. (I avoid calling the player a bad because raiding is meant to be a team effort.)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Somehow in 2 years these people had never been in there once on any character???!!!!? of course someone gave a quick overview of the fight, we pulled and wiped at the first vortex and then i and a couple others just left.<br />
<br />
Sorry mate, your elitist &quot;head stuck up your own arse&quot; approach to Tier 7 raids doesn't quite cut it here.<br />
<br />
That being said, the vortexes should have been piss easy to handle. It doesn't do much damage and if the healers were awake, you wouldn't have wiped then. Otherwise, many of the wipes come from phase 2 or 3.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">det</div><div class="date">2010-06-18, 01:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Journey through all the raid tiers in TBC<br />
The problem is that journey was not made by many players (and I'm talking about interested players, not those with no interest in raiding). For everyone who progressed through all of those tiers, a huge percentage of players dropped out along the way, possibly just from the time commitment before they finally got to see the exciting new stuff that everyone was talking about. It might have worked okay for very tight-knit guilds with very stable rosters, but it was a hassle for other guilds who had to go do farming runs just to gear up one or two new players or alts before they could get back into progression. Again, it was more content to have to go back and do old zones, but I'm not sure it was fun content.<br />
<br />
We want raiding players, in general, to be able to see the final content. If Icecrown was being used by 10% or less of the raiding population then not only is it pretty hard to justify all of the production time it takes to make a raid, but it also feels to players who don't finish the journey like they don't get to see the climax of the story. Game designers, at least in this day and age, actually want players to finish their games, not drop out somewhere along the way when things get too tedious and difficult. (If you like difficult, that's what heroic modes are for. If you like tedious, well I guess try to get the Insane in the Membrane achievement.)

<br />
Skill vs. Gear<br />
If you want to know a little secret, part of the reason we can't use gear as a barrier to entry any longer is because the skill of the raiding population has grown so dramatically. The guilds who got the first kills in Icecrown probably could have done it with gear from a couple of tiers prior (with the possible exception of heroic LK). Skill trumps an enormous amount of power from gear. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25399741109/why-does-blizz-want-us-to-raid-less/))<br />
<br />
Raid content accessibility<br />
You're asking for us to spend an inordinate amount of our development time on a very small portion of our player base. That might work for an instance as easy to develop as Molten Core. It won't work for Ulduar. Making raids only for the top 2% is hard to justify when we're sitting there looking at a long feature list trying to decide what features we want to do for Cataclysm and what has to wait. The equivalent would be saying &quot;This is the Survival hunter expansion. We're going to spend a huge chunk of our development time on Survival hunters. If you don't play a hunter, sorry, but please buy our expansion anyway.&quot; Your strategy should actually be welcoming as many players as possible into raids -- that's what allows us to keep spending so much time and effort on them. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25399741109/why-does-blizz-want-us-to-raid-less/))<br />
<br />
Keeping old content alive and challenging<br />
I'm not sure you feel this way, but typically the response is &quot;I walked uphill in the snow, so they should have to as well.&quot; You got to the content first. You were showing off your tier set and Shadowmourne in Dalaran before those others guys. Why does it matter if they will eventually be able to catch up to you (especially since you'll pull ahead again the second a new raid is available)? The alternative is saying that those players should want to run through every raid tier before they can hit the new stuff, but I can tell you that whether or not they want to (and many don't) the facts suggest that they never finish and give up on raiding.<br />
<br />
We're not really trying to keep Black Temple or Sunwell alive at this point, and by the same token, we're okay if Naxx has basically been reduced to achievements or weekly raid quests. It had its time in the sun. We don't need to prop it up forever. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25399741109/why-does-blizz-want-us-to-raid-less/))<br />

CATA = end of 25ppl guilds and raiding<br />
/sad<br />
<br />
P.S. Sorry for my english<br />
<br />
How about &quot;sorry for my bs&quot;? If you like 25 man raiding..and if I add all the moaners here who say they like 25 man raiding but feel like Cata brings the end..well..you and those guys could easily form 100 exclusive 25 man guilds. So why the hell do you just give up before the freaking expansion is even released. Grow some balls and grab some 30 likeminded folks and keep raiding 25 mans if you like it. What is so damn hard about it..why are you so whimpy and just throw in the towel like..4 months before the damn expansion is even released?<br />
<br />
And IF it is the end of 25 man raiding, you and your attitude doesn't deserve better..because you are not even trying to keep it alive.<br />
<br />
At least give this until the game is released, then check how many 25 guilds will ACTUALLY be showing up on wowprogress.</div></div><hr />

I love the raid changes. It's logical and fair. But then all these ZOMG NERD RAGERS clearly just don't want more people having leet items like them, it will bruise their fragile ego to see a 10 man raider decked out, as if their self esteem is based on pixels. PATHETIC!</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bullseyed</div><div class="date">2010-06-18, 01:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I love how the solution to &quot;no one likes killing the same bosses twice a week&quot; is to make it so they can only access half the content. What if the devs actually did their jobs and made the bosses between 10 and 25 man different, unique and exciting? You know, like they did back with the original dev team in Vanilla and TBC.<br />
<br />
I personally like killing the bosses twice a week.<br />
<br />
1.) Can practice on 10 heroic before trying 25 heroic.<br />
2.) Can experiment with strat ideas (risky decisions) to improve gameplay on 10 man without wiping 25 people for hours.<br />
3.) Any halfway decent guild will clear all heroic 25 mans (except LK) in 3 1/2 hours. This means less than one night of raiding per week. My guild has started running alt 25 mans because we're all so piss bored with this game.<br />
3a.) That is what Blizzard wants though. They know most the players are shitty beyond measure. They want the good players to level alts and do alt runs, because they know 5/25 of those people will end up being PUGs you carry through the content, which means more $$$ for ActiBlizzard.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Another thing that comes out of this... they made the game easy because such a small percentage of the player base was experiencing content. So lets say 2 months in with 25s and 10s being mutually exclusive the breakdown is 90% of ppl in 25 mans and 10% of people in 10 mans. Then the 10% in 10 mans is too low of a portion of the population to &quot;bother&quot; developing content for, just like good players are currently seen as too small of a portion to bother with content for.<br />
<br />
Would this mean that they would stop making 10 mans? If not, then they admit that their own logic is terribly flawed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Its certanily better lootwise to go 25mans in Cata, no matter what you say, you will never outsmart blizzard, they know what they are doing. If they want to kill 25 mans, they remove it. Get 24 other people and you got yourself a 25 man group.<br />
<br />

Few people enjoyed doing Karazhan over and over. If instances didn't 'rot' after a few months, people would get burned out on seeing the same crap every single week after 6 or more months.<br />
<br />
How happy would people be right now if there were still badge incentives for clearing 10 and 25-man Naxxramas each week?<br />
<br />
I wouldn't enjoy repeating the 5th grade over and over and over each year, so you know what I did? I realized I wasn't retarded and passed it. There are these things called intelligence, learning and self development. They work wonders for people who aren't retarded.<br />
<br />
No one is suggesting end game badge rewards for clearing Naxx each week, so you can throw that strawman out entirely.<br />
<br />
You know what I hate? When I lead PUGs on my 4th 80 because there is so little content to do, and for boss strats I say something like &quot;it is very similar to boss _____ in Naxx/Ulduar&quot; and they reply &quot;lol whats udulalar i ran dungeon finder and hit 80 last week lololololol&quot;.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
GC keeps going on and on about how everyone has to see content, so they know the story. I agree entirely. This means that before you should be allowed to enter ICC normal 10 man, you need to have killed every previous boss, on heroic and regular. Otherwise you don't know the story. If you never cleared Naxx, you can't go to ToC because you don't know the story. You can't go to ICC if you didn't complete the tournament. We are supposed to be Tirion's champions in ICC. We can't be his champions unless we won the tournament.<br />

Then you have to start raiding on alts. And once you hit 10 alts, you can pay Blizzard for more slots. Then you'll be so starved for good content, you'll start buying shiny ponies on the Blizzard online store.<br />

I am with you on this one...I like my 10 and 25 mans...but at the same time you have people here on this forum throwing tympathic tantrums how they considered content cleared after they did an Instance ONCE on 10 man heroic.<br />
<br />
I also like the varied 10 and 25 mans (or 20 and 40 as in AQ and ZG), but let's face it...those basically kept splitting / rejoining our guild. We had always the base raidforce that cleared the big raids together, but once it came to 10 man, you had one A-Team with the raidleaders, MTs and best healers that got all the juicy achievements and mounts, a B-Team that did so-so but struggled and a C-Team that kept falling apart.<br />
<br />
I still don't know how these shared lockouts will play with my guild...you are asking reserves to not raid anything until your last official raidday in a week so they don't get saved on a different ID. I hate that. Under the current model they could still do at least a 10 man and not miss out on a week of raiding.<br />

If you want do it twice or more, do it on alts :) (skill &gt; gear anyway and gear is easy to get almost best tier to be there with it). <br />
If you have the time to do it twice you have the time to have an alt and probably well enough geared. <br />
<br />
But anyway, I look maybe at most of my friends only, and we are in the game for the fun / entertainment, so if we liked something we won't drop it because something else is more convenient. But I guess that's why some people are managers and some people are just workers in real life as well, because some like to manage things and are good at it and some just like to listen to orders.<br />
<br />
Of course some people's vision of fun is to go in there, kill everything at the hit of a button and go have sex. I guess they don't like a challenge and probably only go to m********* instead of the real thing, but that's their choice and they still have it :)</div></div><hr />

You are a 25 man heroic guild. It is your second raiding day, on a progression boss. Of your 25 main raiders, 23 show up because 2 people are loot-n-scoot-ers. You can 23 man on normal, you can try to 23 man on heroic (works in ICC, but hopefully not in Cata) or you can switch to two 10 heroic groups. This means 3 of the 23 people get screwed. You aren't going to find 7 PUGs for 10 heroic to spread across three groups.<br />
<br />
What the new system really means is you CANT do ANYTHING unless you have your ideal group, because it will lock you out of everyone else. If we are missing 2-3 players for 25 heroic, we used to be able to run some 10 normals/heroics to kill time. Now we can't because that would compromise the 25 man heroic save.<br />
<br />
AWESOME SYSTEM.<br />
<br />
Dunno, there are enough problems with it that it should have failed the &quot;proof of concept&quot; design stage. I have a feeling they will force it through anyway. As for &quot;reverting it if it fails&quot; this is Blizzard we're talking about. If it fails you throw money and time at it, repeatedly, making the problem worse. For reference, see arena since Season 2.</div></div><hr />

If you have the time to do it twice you have the time to have an alt and probably well enough geared. <br />

<br />
Yeah..i am aware of Blizzards thinking on this.. I am also aware that guilds competing for world first actually used the &quot;play an alt&quot; argument to say how fail the concept of limited tries was...because they felt &quot;forced&quot; to roll alts.<br />
<br />
Also as I said...from the point of a raider who does not get into a weekly 25 mna with his guild on day 1...or 2..he used to have the option to at least get his 10 man going parallel...but whatever. As with all things, there are different ways to see it.<br />
<br />
Planned to raid (more) on my priest in cataclysm anyhow...so, yeah...will be a main and an alt for the first tier.</div></div><hr />

just because you're allowing more people to raid, doesn't mean you're allowing more people to see all the instance.<br />

it's an improvement, and i like where you're going with this blizzard, but i want some sort of encouragement to re-run the old tiers. (maybe the end bosses like kel'thuzad and yogg-saron dropping 3 frost emblems? that'd be enough)</div></div><hr />

I'm not sure what your statement here is. Are you saying that because people failed at it, it should be made harder? Because that sounds rather silly.<br />
<br />
If you fail T7 content in T9-10, then that isn't the game's fault. It is the players'. And honestly, you should be able to 5 man Malygos considering the huge gear gap.<br />
<br />
Yeap, and he is stating that instead of showing that it's players fault, Blizzard take full responsability of it and throw it as game's fault, making a way for those players to keep &quot;failing and winning&quot; at higher content levels.<br />
<br />
---------- Post added 06-18-2010 at 04:42 PM ----------<br />

<br />
I don't get this attitude. If you need more incentive to keep running 25 man, then obviously you don't really like 25 man. You say people do 10 mans because they are lazy (I don't see what's lazy about not having 24 other people available at the same time to raid, but alas..) and people do 25 mans because of gear. Who plays for fun then? <br />
<br />
If people all choose to do 10 man instead of 25, no matter what their reason is, and you still want 25 man, you are the minority. Business wise there is no reason to cater to the minority. Find a guild of people that like 25 man also and raid with them. If 25 man really dies, Blizzard made a good decision by offering the same rewards in 10 man, because everyone only did 25 man for loot, which is not fun.<br />
<br />
I actually prefer 10 man over the 25 man chaos (always 2 people who screw up, 3 who do 1k dps and 1 on follow...), no matter what loot I get there. I welcome this change. The only difference between 25 and 10 is the logistics of getting 24 or 9 other people to play with you at the same time. Logistics should not be rewarded. It's a game, doing stuff ingame should be rewarded (like better loot in heroic raids), not doing stuff outside of the game. I have enough logistic challenges in my work, I don't need them in game.<br />
<br />
Basically you like it easy (10 over 25man CHAOS), so it doesn't matter and it's even better for you. Fine.<br />
<br />
The problem is that with those changes, it will be harder to find other 24 players like him to keep raiding 25. It doesn't matter, each one of those 24 that you may find are not necessary on the same &quot;thinking&quot; page. Some may decide to bail after some wipes trying to progress in a 25 enviroment because they will finally notice that they don't need to do 25man anymore since it's not the &quot;way of raiding&quot;. They'll get the exactly same content progression, quests (raid quests or legendary quests, whatever), drops... why bother with a harder way of doing the exactly same thing?<br />
<br />
It's easier, but at the same time considered equal challenge as 25. It's a win-win situation.<br />
<br />
Why would a &quot;realm's 1st&quot; guild would bother with 25 if they can go faster and easier for the same (as their competitors and other new guilds that will show up since they can do it on 10, but never had 25 players of the same skill/will)??</div></div><hr />

For 10ppl raiding you need 10-12 ppl in guild. There’s no real rotation, no stand-by ppls. Easy and funny raiding, no stress with „omg slackerz!, doh where are ours healers! etc.”<br />
Atm most of large guilds need 35+ ppl for effective raiding = less loot per 1 raider. More complications with logistics, MUCH MORE.<br />

<br />
Because that guild works well in 25 man format? 25 man was always easier from a technical standpoint, it was just getting the right people that was the issue. If you have the right group, why separate when you can still all raid together? <br />
<br />
A guild that is good with it's pally, warrior, and bear tank, specific healers, and assorted DPS will do better in 25 than if they decide to split up and try to get used to the smaller amount of buffs and situational abilities some of the classes in the other 10 group have, that they have come to expect in their 25 man group.</div></div><hr />

If you like 25 mans, RUN 25 MANS. This game sucks nowadays just because everyone is such gear whores. I love 25 mans so much, but my computer really sucks and I can't handle them.

R.I.P. 25man raiding.<br />
<br />
Using your example, along with what GC said, let's say Shadowmourne came out in the first tier of Cata, and that it is ICC.<br />
<br />
10 = 1 Blood from Rot/Fester ea.<br />
25 = 2-3 Blood from Rot/Fester ea.<br />
<br />
10/25 = Same amount of mobs so same amount of souls, only 3 people are getting credit at once (correct me if I'm wrong here)<br />
<br />
10 = One guy getting hit by frost<br />
25 = 2/3 guys getting hit by frost<br />
<br />
10 = 1 Shadowfrost shard per drop<br />
25 = 2/3 Shadowfrost shards per drop<br />
<br />
How were the 10's going to get it faster again?<br />
<br />
The only downside to this would be the loot chest when you completed the chain, being it's one per shadowmourne, and they'd have to wait for the following weeks to get the extra loot. But this part wouldn't apply really since we don't know how they are going to go about something like that next time.<br />
<br />
Also I have never been in a guild that uses a rotation or switches people out, unless someone had to go, and we've been progressing just fine into heroic modes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The problem with raiding in TBC was that the first 25 required getting everyone keyed up, Onyxia style. that was a pain in the ass despite how good the Kara content was. The second issue was that you had to farm 4-6 days a week to craft a set of gear that was good enough to attempt the 1st raid tier (+ farming for enchants) and continue farming for pots in order to pass the content's gear check. The third issue was that the content was poorly balanced and hammered melee, in addition to stupid bugs that required guilds to use dumb tricks to get around. Lastly, the gear rewards were so poorly balanced that there was no point in doing the 1st raid tier, except to get to the second.<br />
<br />
Basically, I completed all the vanilla raids (O, MC, BWL, AQ40) and the time requirement to raid in TBC was just brutal, at least for the first 4 months or so. There was so much time involved to get ready for a raid that it burnt you out before you even stepped into the content that you wanted to do. <br />
<br />
Would 10-mans have made a difference? Maybe, but not if the 10's had the same problems that the 25's did.<br />
<br />
Blizzard is also sadly misinformed about how they're going to reward players in CAT. They've created a game where very few players do content that doesn't reward them appropriately for the time and/or effort needed to complete that content. The new reward system doesn't make any sense. Why would you go through the hassle of getting 25 people together when you get the same rewards for the 10-man version of the raid? Maybe ... maybe, the top 100-200 guilds in the NA region would do the 25-man version if that's the reward system. From my experience, half the battle in raiding is managing the players and if you can eliminate that problem and still get the same gear ...</div></div><hr />

<br />
MANY 25 man guilds will breakup over this... because while it's easy to SAY &quot;Don't recruit idiots&quot;... it's much harder in practice when ALL that there is left are the inexperienced, casual players.<br />
<br />
ANYONE that says there is a pool of experienced peeps to recruit from is full of shit.<br />

Finally a smart 25man raider. This just leads me further into my conclusion that anyone crying about 25 mans dying are the people getting carried in their 25 man raid. They just want the extra reward with no real additional effort on their part. Raid leader does all the work, they get carried, they get phat lootz to mask how bad they are.

I don't think you understand the way this works at all. You don't get infinite spawns of legendary items. It is a decent drop chance, but takes over a month to assemble, per person. Assuming you wanted to gear up 3 players with legendaries, and assuming there is a 50% drop rate on shards and assuming it takes 20 to make Shadowmourne here is how it would go:<br />
<br />
In 25 man:<br />
Week 1: Player A gets items off rot/fester, 6 bosses left, 50% drop rate, 3 fragments.<br />
Week 2: Player B gets items off rot/fester, 12 bosses, 50% drop rate, 6 fragments, total 9 on Player A.<br />
Week 3: Player C gets items off rot/fester, 12 bosses, 50% drop rate, 6 fragments, total 15 on Player A.<br />
Week 4: Items on rot/fester are trashed, 12 bosses, 50% drop rate, 6 fragments, total 20 on Player A, total 1 on Player B. Player A makes legendary.<br />
Week 5: 12 Bosses, 50% drop rate, 6 fragments, 7 on Player B<br />
Week 6: 13 on Player B<br />
Week 7: 19 on Player B<br />
Week 8: 20 on Player B, 5 on Player C. Player B makes legendary.<br />
Week 9: 11 on Player C.<br />
Week 10: 17 on Player C.<br />
Week 11: 20 on Player C, 3 rot. Player C makes legendary.<br />
<br />
On 10 man the drop rate would (presumably) be the same. Otherwise it would be unfair to 10 man guilds.<br />
Week 1: Player A B and C get rot/fester items. 3 shards each, total 9.<br />
Week 2: 9 shards each, total 27.<br />
Week 3: 15 shards each, total 45.<br />
Week 4: 20 shards each, 1 shard rots each, total 63.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Sure, you could lower the drop rate for 10 mans, but then real 10 man guilds would take far longer per person to get legendaries, which violates the same loot different playstyle metric they are supposedly using.<br />
<br />
Ok, so what if they make it so if shards drop, it drops for as many people have the quest in the raid? Then you farm up the pre-quest for every single melee in raid and they all each get a shadowmourne in (example) 4 weeks.<br />
<br />
There is no good solution, because dividing the raids up like that is a bad idea. I would much rather run 10 mans and be able to get rid of 25s (or make 25 = 20 or 30), but it just isnt feasible the way things are currently done.<br />
<br />
I'm still LOLing over how hard GC failed at math in this post.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Q u o t e:<br />
But you aren't making 25 mans more efficient at earning gear -- you guys are making 25s on PAR with 10s for earning gear. In current 25 man, its a 3 to 1 ratio of players to loot per boss versus 2 to 1 in 10 man. If you make 25s 2 to 1 as you propose, you aren't making it any better than a 10 -- you are only bringing 25s to be in sync with the way 10s are. 2 to 1 == 2 to 1. As previously said many times, extra gold is silly, extra rep is silly. The only thing that compels people to run 25s is better loot -- not having 15 more people jibba jabbering in vent and messing things up for your raid.<br />
<br />
<br />
You lost me a little there. Current raids don't drop 2 or 3 loot items per player -- they drop 2 or 3 items per raid. Your way would be 20 to 75 pieces of loot. Do you mean that a 10 drops 1 piece per 5 players and a 25 drops 1 piece per 8.3 players? Imagine those ratios were reversed and a 10 dropped 1.2 items per raid (1 per 8.3 players) and a 25 dropped 5 per raid (1 per 5 players). Now the 25 is more efficient. It's more complicated than that because you might have more competition for a powerful drop in 25s, while you might shard more loot in 10s because the target class / spec isn't present.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anyway, I'm very happy after reading these blue posts. I'm still a bit miffed that the achievements are exactly the same, but a larger loot % dropping per person of actual armor is what i was hoping for and expecting. A 10 man can get unlucky and see the same couple of niche pieces or armor several weeks in a row...that chance is lessened quite a bit when there's more dropping for 25 mans. 25s man guilds will be gearing up much faster than a 10 man, and that means the rewards for the logistical difficulty are there.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
10man does not even come close to the epicness of 25man. 10man are for lazy people. It won't be fair if 10man is exactly the same as 25man, same difficulty, same loot, same vanity items and in the same amount. This way 25man will die out because 95% of the people play for gear, want to earn it the easiest way possible and show it off in cities. Dunno what poeple get from doing the latter.<br />
<br />
It is this kind of attitude which lead to the merging of 10 and 25 man loot pools in the first place. Maybe if more people with your mindset had kept your mediocre opinions to yourself and leave 10 man groups well enough alone instead of looking down and berating anyone who would DARE prefer them to 25s, you'd still have a unique 25 loot pool to fawn over and kiss goodnight. Too bad so sad.</div></div><hr />

You're the reason there is such an influx of bad players in the game now a days. You don't have to be good, just pay an elitist to drag you through the game, no need to theory craft or learn your class.<br />
<br />
It may be your 3rd alt, or some shit, but some people are new. Just because you have nothing to gain doesn't mean the others around you have nothing to gain. It's a very selfish way of thinking. And those other 3 that left are selfish too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Point is, someone else was having trouble and rather than do anything constructive, he just simply left the raid. So of course, it was Blizzard's fault... /rolleyes<br />
<br />
I'm sorry but it is not his responsibility to teach somebody a raid encounter in a pug. If a new 80 or new raider is interested in raiding, it is is that individuals own responsibility to be aware of the past/current raids that he or she intends on doing for achievements or the weekly.<br />
<br />
When you see the weekly is Malygos or Jarraxus or Marrowgar or anything for that matter, you don't just jump in blindly and hope that your pug can carry you. Its incredibly inconsiderate to involve yourself in a raid that you have absolutely no idea about what to do in. So if the weekly is Malygos and you have never done it before, read up on it BEFORE you go into a pug and waste everyone's time.<br />
<br />
It's not your servers job to teach you how to run an encounter. It's your own responsibility to know whats what. <br />
<br />
And no, I am not hardcore. I am in a 10-man guild and raid casually throughout the week maybe 1-3 nights depending on whats going on in real life. But I at least have the common decency and intelligence to know that if I expect to be involved in a raid I need to put my best foot forward and at least have a BASIC understanding of the mechanics before even attempting it so I am not a hinderance to my guild or any pugs i join.<br />
<br />
So the REAL problem with wow is not players like the one who left the Maly pug. But players who bitch and moan about &quot;douchebags not helping me/others&quot; when they are not helping themselves. People have become far too lazy in this game and even with the incredibly easy access to raid content they want to have less and less responsibility for their performance and actions.<br />
<br />
With the plethora of informational sites out there on every aspect of the game there is absolutely no excuse for not being able to prepare yourself for a raid even if it is the weekly and you intend on pugging it.<br />
<br />
<br />
It may be your 3rd alt, or some shit, but some people are new. Just because you have nothing to gain doesn't mean the others around you have nothing to gain. It's a very selfish way of thinking. And those other 3 that left are selfish too.<br />
<br />
Again, see above. I disagree, the selfish ones were those who joined a raid group without putting any effort whatsoever into researching the encounter beforehand. If you have never done Malygos and it is the weekly, look it up so you're not a hinderance to the 9 or 24 other people you join up with. Takes like all of 15 minutes to at the very least read about what happens in each phase, what abilities to be aware of, and what to expect. <br />
<br />
The only thing I would have done different than the 4 who bailed on the group is politely tell those in raid that didn't know what was going on they need to look up the encounter on youtube or read about it on Tankspot/wowwiki.<br />
<br />
But I'll bet you 10 bucks that at least half of the people would get defensive, tell me to stfu, and call me elitist even though I was directing them to something that would help them succeed.</div></div><hr />

Actually, if you read the NDA itself and understand legal jargon, it's not against the terms of the NDA to say &quot;I'm under an NDA&quot; or that you're part of the Alpha. You're just not allowed to share anything that falls under a rather large list of information (carefully worded to minimize what you're able to say/share). Now, whether or not the mods here think it's kosher to say you're part of the Alpha? That's another story altogether.</div></div><hr />

Of course it would be foolhardy to expect the &quot;Gearscore Slaves&quot; (The term I use to describe people who only wish to raid/play/interact with people whose GS is as close to 6k as possible. Six months ago it was 5k but meh). The comments regarding Skill vs. Gear direct from GC will hopefully herald an end to the Gearscore mentality too many people/guilds feel the need to live and breathe. I have an 80 Warlock. My GS is 4.6k as of this week. I cleared TOC10 for the first time on Sunday. My DPS is 2k on the dot and despite latency issues we had little trouble clearing all the encounters--including Anub'arak.</div></div><hr />

But isn't one of your (and by &quot;your&quot;, I mean more hardcore raiders) most popular excuses &quot;The game changes at 80&quot;? &quot;Once you hit 80, it's a completely different game&quot;? I don't seem to recall soloing raids like I did quests on the way to 80.<br />

yeah, more like &quot;blizzard gamedesigners actually want players to skip 80% of all (raid-) content and go straight to the end-content instead of actualy &quot;playing the game&quot;. the fact that the gamedesigners render 80%+ of the raidcontent useless does not concern them at all, nah thats cool because wow is about players &quot;seeing end-content&quot; and getting instant gratifications shoveled up their collective ***** instead of actualy playing a challanging game... aaaight, got it.<br />

I don't know the details because we probably won't do a legendary for the first tier, but we would definitely not want a structure such that a 25 guild felt like the fastest way to finish the item was to run multiple 10s. If the 25s could finish it first, that would be fine. The 10s would still be able to get the item, which is not possible today. (Source)<br />
<br />
<br />
If this means 10man-runners get a chance to complete legendaries then...WHY THE HELL DIDN'T YOU THINK TO DO THIS IN WRATH!?!<br />
<br />
Right now, I have my 25 primoridals and hammer shaft...but I'm stuck because I can't get into a 25man ICC; 10man isn't an issue though. 10man-runners, though, should have to work twice as hard as someone who runs a 25man. In order to balance out the rate of 'Item Completion'.</div></div><hr />

No matter how good you explain it and seriously i lol everytime i see all the new sentences and all those different ways you use to satisfy all the different type of raiders avoiding any admission that this game is going all the way to &quot;commercial island&quot;,and trust me when i say this: YOU GOT IT ALL WRONG.Just ask some hardcores and you'll see that a hardcore guild is based on uniqueness HELL MORE than speedy progressing which stills one of the goal of a hardcore guild but not the reason why most of the people play for.<br />
Uniqueness is the key my friends.Get up that hill,look around you and think that you're the king of that hill,but for the moment and looking at the future there will be no king,instead there will just be a bunch of peons looking all the same at the foot of the hill.</div></div><hr />

I do not suggest so, it was catered but not in huge amounts as Cata... first off, Ulduar was a thinker, hardmodes all that crap ;)<br />
2nd, Merging 10 and 25 basically, is completely stupid, worst decision blizz ever made... The competition is completely being removed from this game, nobody is gonna care.<br />
<br />
The only way they can fix it, is to make the difference in rewards, titles, and if they make 10 man Extremely hard, so you can not even pug first boss... like back in BC hard, not Wrath of Lich King hard...<br />
<br />
Casual QQ ruined this game, Blizz greed ruined this game, 20% of players who are hardcore raiders gonna look for a new game after they finish Cata content in 1 day with a pug of autistic kids</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cerbul</div><div class="date">2010-06-21, 10:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If Blizzard wants to have a real balance between 10 and 25 will only be possible if they change 10 to 15. Only in this setup the amount of specs present in the raid will cover for more complicated boss mechanics and will be able to make them as complicated as in 25. 10 ppl instances lack utility, and giving more utility to a 10 ppl group (statistically talking), will break the pvp balance. Once again we are trumped down due to the pvp aspect of this game.. Let me give you an example:<br />
<br />
LK 10 - 1 valkyr to stun. everyone has to dps one valkyr only. No setup needed, no assignments, no mistakes due to the fact that ppl stun the same target cause is only one target. <br />
If they make 15 players raids instead of 10 they can go with 3 tanks 3/4 healers and 8 9 dps, and they could have done LK encounter with 2 Valkyrs instead of 1. Now only in this situation the game could be called balanced between 15 and 25 players. Also, modifying what can be brought to the table on a 10 ppl raid so that Blizzard ensures that they can put more complicated encounters, will automatically mean both that the pvp balance is destroyed, and the 25 ppl setup becomes so forgiving that it becomes trivial(this means that you could cover all is needed with 6 7 players and you can bring what you want for the rest).</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kanjee</div><div class="date">2010-06-21, 05:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">indeed a 10 man won't EVER be as hard as a 25 man just because coordinating people and their damage or moving its awesomely easier,no matter the type of content no matter the abilities of the boss.Its even easier to spot mistakes around by people if you have only 9 players to check,plus,even in terms of spacing and distances for aoe/range dmg going on in the raid its piss easy to spread ppl around and to even have some space left for moving.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cerbul</div><div class="date">2010-06-22, 11:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">What I am really concerned about is not having the same difficulty or same gear (let's assume that they will somehow manage to make them same difficulty). My problem is that as it is at the moment, 25 ppl in ilevel 264 gear is much harder then 10 ppl in ilevel 251 gear. So? What will Blizzard do? Can I have a guess on this one? Blizzard will do 25 man easyer, cause their statistics show that anyway most of the casuals can't kill putricide. And guess what, casuals will not be able to kill putricide or other &quot;not puggable&quot; bosses not for the reason that they are casuals, but for other reasons:<br />
<br />
1. Casuals usualy don't have leaders that will to put the effort to explain a tactic, cause the amount of effort is just not rewarded.<br />
2. Casuals will not buy a ventrilo/teamspeak/whatever other talking program that is decent so that their leaders will be able to use them to rxplain tactics.<br />
3. Casuals don't know how to install addons, or jsut can't be bothered to learn to use a computer for the sake of being more succesful at a game.<br />
4. Blizzard is not putting more effort into making ingame addons that cover properly for the following factors:<br />
- seing target of target'target, focus target, proper healing raid frames, information on those frames, integrated DBM, and alot more things that ONLY LATELY started to be slowly added ingame.<br />
Blizzard is working to make it impossible for ppl to fail at gearing, and make their rotations less taxing, instead of working on the addons, tools to compare gear, and alot of other things that help the casual.<br />
Let me put it simple:<br />
Why give less taxing rotations and less chances to fail on gearing for the casuals when the ANSWER about bringing more close the casual and the hardcore lyes in ADDONS, COMMUNICATION, TOOLS to help someone that doesn't know much about computers will be able to use to become more competitive? <br />
I think that this philosophy of bringing closer in performance the casual with the hardcore is wrong, cause a skilled player that doesn't know/doesn't want to put effort into installing tools to help him, will not be as competitive as a hardcore player.<br />
<br />
One other problem that we will most likely face in Cataclysm will be: when we will reach the cap for emblems/etc what is left to do for the player that enjoys raiding only? Alts? <br />
I understand that not having to grind 2 hours every day is a nice thing, and I really like it that way, but why do I have to be forced to not be able to do more if I want to? Where is my reward at auction house for being more succesfull at dungeons than others? Where did the harder heroics go after BC? Why there is nothing challenging to do ingame from raiding point of view out of raiding hours? I do not mind having to do a random every day, but when I enter one and mobs die before I reach them due to the fact that I am melee and casters already killed them by the time I reach them I really rather not do any randoms at all, cause they are not cahllenging at all, and there is nothing there to make me feel rewarded for the work I put in... <br />
Why not give more options for the ppl that want to play more, or want to put more effort into it? Why not release new heroics every tier? Or, why not add every tier a &quot;normal&quot;, &quot;medium&quot;, &quot;hard&quot; mode for the respective Tier X, Tier X+1, Tier X+2 for those heroics? You do know that Magisters Terrace, Shadow Labirinth, and a few others were tuned such way that I could have a small challenge every day by day? I agree not having to do randoms every day, cause of the badges cap, but why do I have to run pathetically easy randoms, which do not warm me in any way, not to mention the rewards that could give?<br />
Professions are finaly fair that they provide aproximatively same rewards for the raider, regardless of class/spec, but why does it has to be best in slot? Can't it be like Feet were in ICC for plate wearers(guess other classes crafted feet were the same) as they could be replaced with other items that actualy drop in that instance?<br />
<br />
Guess what, I do like the pressure a 10 ppl dungeon puts on the shoudlers of a player, and I am always happy to do 10 man though I raid lead a 25 ppl guild.<br />
But why do I have to do nothing outside of the 25 ppl schedule? Nothing rewarding, nothing challenging, just worthless randoms that I usualy fall asleep on when I do them after raid..</div></div><hr />
