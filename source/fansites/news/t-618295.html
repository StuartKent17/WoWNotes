Minor patch to be released after Patch 3.0.2<br />
The items checked to complete the C'thun kill achievement have been updated ... Not interesting enough ? Well, Tigole also mentionned that this achievement is getting fixed in a patch deployed after the upcoming one. Patch 3.0.2 is still expected to be released next week (but not officialy confirmed in any way for the moment) and we'll probably see Patch 3.0.3 deployed shortly after. <br />
We just added the C'Thun BP's to the retro list. Previously, we were checking the quests but the quests were not recorded because they are repeatable.<br />
<br />
This fix won't go in the upcoming patch but one that will follow that patch by a week or two. So hang on to those C'Thun BP's and you'll get credit. <br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/24x24/warrior.jpg Upcoming Warrior Changes<br />
Arms: We are going to change Sudden Death to be based on a chance per hit and not a chance per crit. That shouldn't adversely affect their dps, but will also hopefully keep them from stacking nothing but crit. We do want to see warriors with swords and maces after all.<br />
<br />
Fury: We are lowering the cooldown on Bloodthirst to 5 sec (from 6) and lowering the penalty on Titan's Grip to 12% (from 15%). Our hope is that with more BTs and more yellow hits connecting that the excess rage will drain away. The net dps increase will also help Fury catch up to Arms.<br />
<br />
I understand that many of you suggested a new attack for Fury. That is a pretty major change so we want to make sure it's needed (for Lich King ship -- we could always add it as a later patch). We would need to reorganize the tree, adjust trainers, perhaps change other talents to affect it, perhaps change glyphs, and all of that assumes we get the numbers close on the first attempt. More than likely it would take a lot of iteration. So, it's still on the table, but it's a last resort for now and something we will definitely consider at a later date. <br />
<br />
Blue posts<br />
Cold-Weather flying not required to level up at higher levels<br />
This is not true. You are not required to have Cold Weather Flying to complete leveling in the 77-80 zones. If you do not have Cold Weather Flying, you will get a &quot;loaner mount&quot; that will permit you to complete leveling in the zones. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/10972109095-first-time-ever-leveling-requires-gold-sink.html))<br />
<br />
Hallow's end changes<br />
The event has been updated slightly. It did not receive a major overhaul but we polished some aspects of the event and added some new things. <br />
You won't have to exit Scarlet Monastery, reset the instance and then re-enter for each attempt you take on the Headless Horseman. <br />
Broom mounts will be back (they still have a duration, so you'll only see them during Hallow's End). They work differently this year. There is only one &quot;broom&quot; mount and anyone can use it. It moves at whatever riding skill speed you have. If you don't have any riding skill, it moves at run speed. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/10972069731-halloween-event.html))<br />
<br />
Hallow's End starting date<br />
To clear this up right now: Hallow's End begins on October 18th at 4:00AM server time and will end on November 1st at 4:00AM server time. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/10971859278-halloween-events.html))<br />
<br />
Reasons behind the Motorcycle<br />
We added these because we thought they were cool. Cool is a very subjective concept. If some people don't want to ride a motorcycle, that's all good -- there are plenty of other mounts for them. Conceptually, they fit in perfectly considering Engineering is a profession which players can pursue. Between Goblin and Gnome technology, there is already a precedent for this type of engineering in the game. Shredders, mechano-striders, flying machines, siege tanks, etc. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/10972108525-whats-the-reasoning-behind-the-motorcycle.html))<br />

http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/24x24/druid.jpg Druid (Skills List (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=700) / Talent Calc. (9061) (http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?druid))<br />
Eclipse<br />
I have followed a lot of the Eclipse number crunching. Here are things I think are valid concerns:<br />
Is 10 sec too short to get your spells off?<br />
Is increasing a random chance good for Starfire? Over time, it should still work out to an increase, especially given other crit benefits. But you could proc Eclipse and not get a crit, or &quot;waste&quot; a crit on one you would have already gotten one.<br />
<br />
Here are things I don't believe are valid concerns:<br />
The RNG or proc-watching aspects. This was exactly the design. If you want a very stable rotation and aren't RNG tolerant, I absolutely would skip over this talent. We wanted it to be optional to some extent -- this is why it isn't the next-to-last 5 point talent (though yours isn't 5 points now anyway). Some players like to be rewarded for really paying attention to procs, or get really bored casting the same spells over and over according to a pre-determined rotation.<br />
<br />
Now, one mistake I do see in some (not all) of the math is assuming that Eclipse will proc as soon as the previous one ends. With a 30 sec cooldown, the real cooldown will probably be closer to 38-40 sec. Keep cranking. It's certainly possible our math is off.

http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/24x24/hunter.jpg Hunter (Skills List (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=620) / Talent Calc. (9061) (http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?hunter))<br />
Ferocious Inspirations raid-wide confirmed<br />
Yes, it is supposed to be raid-wide. Fixed. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/3/10971928367-ferocious-inspiration-raidwide.html))<br />
<br />
Aspect of the Viper / Haste bonus on gear<br />
Couple of follow-ups:<br />
On Viper: Letting it proc off melee auto attacks and specials is probably something we could do (this was mentioned up above). That may not solve all of your mana problems, but it might help when someone gets up in your stuff.<br />
On Haste: I know our item budget is a little cryptic, and to some extent we like it that way. However, if we removed any haste from your items, we would have to replace it with something else that is probably equally sub-optimal. It's a &quot;B stat&quot; for hunters if you will. We can't just peel off haste and replace it with say Agi or AP (or if we did, the total would be a lot lower) or the item would be over-budget.

I am now in the process of getting those ones that wispher you normally<br />
<br />
Fgidyl: Hi<br />
Me: Erm Hello<br />
Fgidyl: Can you remember the last time?<br />
Me: Erm what &quot;last time&quot;<br />
Fgidyl: The last time you bought gold from us, if not its time to buy some more!<br />
Me: Look I never bought gold from you before, I play 10 hours a day and complete all 25 of my dailies on 3 characters everyday, why would I ever need to buy gold.<br />
Fgidyl: Insert gold spammer engrish macro here.<br />
Me: Reported...<br />
<br />
The problem is now I am hearing wisphers about GM's contacting people back and asking them why they bought gold before, very sneaky, very clever little tatic they have started going here. I would put a minimum wispher level on my account but since I speak to alot of people making level 1 alts for guild recruitment I can not, its driving me nuts!</div></div><hr />

I play on European servers so I am used to seeing bizzare names that mean something in another language but look like a random collection of letters in English.

You have a few thousand attending Blizzcon and they create a whole new type of bear mount with a murloc on it plus extra functionality (mount changes speed based on riding skill - by the way im not looking forward to my 100% pinto)<br />
<br />
Meanwhile Blizzard has a community of millions of druids, who all have to have the same graphic for their bear, cat, aqua, travel, tree, moonkin forms? It is simply ridiculous that Druids have been left in this way and from what I've heard Ghostcrawler has said they are pretty ashamed of that.<br />
<br />
Not even going into the fact that whilst I appreciate the cat model for tauren, it is obviously rushed and not polished. Same for the travel form. Where is the druid markings, horns for tauren, ears for elf versions? <br />
<br />
Now to be a decent druid healer you now have to look like a stupid tree, identical to all other druids over the level of 50. It was bad enough feral druids all had to look the same, but then they added a balance and resto forms (which you have hardly ANY reason to not be in). If people think this is not offputting for people then they obviously are not in the same community circles I am in.<br />
<br />
I for one am just glad all holy priests don't have to look like an identical light well hovering around and throwing out heals. How many people would play Shaman or Paladin healer just because of the graphic if that happened? Answer: A lot<br />
<br />
::)<br />
<br />
TLDR: New Bear Mount, Old Druid Froms that are horrible outdated, Priorities?, Why are resto and balance druids forced to be in stupid forms! Bring back tauren/elf form druids or make holy form where all priests look like a lightwell while healing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Functionally, Haste is mp5. The more haste you have, the less time you spend in Aspect of the Viper. It's a mana regen stat.<br />
<br />
It's still bad, mind you, more of a &quot;c&quot; stat than a &quot;b&quot; stat... but better than mp5. Although I'm not sure anyone has done the math for Haste including the mana regen effect, it could be slightly better than we think... but like I said I haven't seen the math on that so I don't actually know.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Would be a nice idea, because an OOM hunter is basically useless.. but I fear they wanted to avoid stacking MP5 gears + AotV.. To at least still make people &quot;conserve/manage&quot; their mana.. with the changes to AotV that is. <br />
<br />
in unrelated news..<br />
<br />
I really can't wait to find out how all this [wotlk] plays out, but I'm glad I'll be taking my time and enjoying it, not rushing to do it all at once.. <br />
<br />
I'm not going to cry if I'm not 80 within a few days, but I'll be working hard and fast to get there.. my only wish is I spent more time leveling toons instead of waiting for raiders that were never going to show.. <br />
<br />
as for blizzcon, it looks like it's going to be a blast of a party. I'd love to have gone but it's a far distance from Canada. I say BlizzCon should be in Toronto next year! (screw Montreal/Vancouver- ONTARIO FTW).</div></div><hr />

The printed image is way better than the plain Blizzard on the normal authenticator.<br />
<br />
For some reason I was thinking more functionality than aesthetics, never crossed my mind that &quot;Special Edition&quot; probably meant &quot;Limited Edition&quot;. :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's basically a keygenerator to add extra security to your account, most people have it with their real life bank account either. You just flag your WoW account for having an authenticator and then you will have to enter not only username and password but also an extra key which can only be randomly generated with that authenticator. The code changes every time so you can't keylog it.</div></div><hr />
