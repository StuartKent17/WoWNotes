Updated Features<br />
<br />
Artifact Knowledge and Class Hall Updates<br />
New Bind-on-Account items are available from the Artifact Researcher in your Class Order Hall. These items can be sent to alternate characters to immediately get them to higher Artifact Knowledge levels.<br />
<br />
For new players just reaching 110, there is a new set of repeatable quests that will allow you to immediately exchange Order Hall Resources for Artifact Knowledge up to Artifact Knowledge level 15.<br />
<br />
The time it takes to complete Class Hall research has been reduced. A shorter time to complete Class Hall research for Tiers 3, 4, 5, and 6 will make it easier to upgrade your Class Halls on alts and new characters.<br />
<br />
Find Premade Groups from the Quest Tracker<br />
When you’re looking for players that are doing the same World Quest, you can now easily search for groups in the Quest Tracker. For group quests, a small button will appear next to the quest name. For all other quests, right click the quest name and then click “Find Group.” This will automatically launch a search for groups of players who are doing that quest. If none are found, you can start a group with one click – all the details will be filled in for you.<br />
<br />
More Group Finder updates:<br />
<br />
A new option allows you to make groups only visible to friends and guildmates of people in the group.<br />
When searching for groups, groups who need your role (based on your active specialization) are sorted to the top of the list.<br />
You will receive a more descriptive message when you are declined when attempting to join a group that is full.<br />
<br />

<br />

Boon of the Builder rewards Sprocket Containers (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/144330-sprocket-container) from kills in the world, about once an hour. These can contain guns/gun parts, engineering consumables, new goggle recipes, and a special new reagent called Hardened Felglass (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/144329-hardened-felglass), used for goggles (see below).<br />
<br />
Added a new quest at level 110 for that rewards the recipe for a Rechargeable Reaves Battery (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/144341-rechargeable-reaves-battery). This item can be used once every 30 minutes and does not have charges.<br />

First WoW tries to pretend it's a competitive e-sport, and then they do stuff like this. :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
Why bother fine-tuning the PvP templates when you could have a 34 trait player fighting a 54 trait player who does 14.5% more damage than him and has a bunch more Stam too?<br />

Yeah exactly it'll mean nothing. Like 1.5% at max rank? You really think they'd give the full 15% at max rank in instanced pvp?<br />

Fury<br />
<br />
Fury Warrior's template secondary stats have been adjusted:<br />
75% Mastery<br />
150% Haste<br />
100% Versatility<br />
75% Critical Strike<br />
<br />
So the stats on your gear don't matter at all in PvP. All that matters is the ilvl. Instead every single character in PvP starts out with about:<br />
<br />
11000 str / agi / int.<br />
22000 stamina.<br />
4050 of each secondary stat.<br />
<br />
Then each class has a set of scaling factors, one for their primary stat, one for stamina and one for each secondary stat. So after this patch a fury warrior in PvP, in ilvl 850 or lower gear will have about:<br />
<br />
3037 mastery (75% of 4050)<br />
6075 haste (150% of 4050)<br />
4050 versatility (100% of 4050)<br />
3037 critical strike (75% of 4050).<br />
<br />
This will scale up a little if you have higher ilvl gear (about 0.1% increase per ilvl increase). <br />
<br />
As near as I can make out the old fury warrior template was just 100% scaling to all secondary stats so basically if you play fury in pvp you will have 25% less mastery, 25% less crit and 50% more haste than before, though I could certainly be wrong on that.<br />

<br />
As a tank my only question is...Why though?<br />
<br />
I saw this on an earlier PTR build and just thought hoped it was an error or place holder. I can't wait to scramble for aggro as someone 'miss-clicked' and pulled the entirety of HoV with that thing. (As a user of Dave Black Ox myself I can safely say the aggro range on that thing is massive)<br />
Not too fond of a DPS spec getting an AoE taunt with a passive large radius but mild threat pulse, but we'll have to wait and see how it gets used.<br />
<br />
Maybe I'm just a bit grumpy that another spec has Dave too...maybe<br />
<br />
Side note: Blood and Brew(Main) looking good this patch. Feel a bit bad for the guard nerf and not even going to comment on Prot war. But Prot pala? The only spec with no changes what so ever.<br />
Overall happy with most of the changes, but some leave my asking-Why?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Let me do some math for you here: (1-.1)*1.12 = 1.008<br />
<br />
It is a small buff if the Ret was already the best dps in the raid and it is a small nerf if the Ret was not.<br />
<br />
All the other ability buffs really just bring other talent loadouts in-line with the basic Final Verdict build.<br />
<br />

If you need something to complain about with Ret, take a look at the changes to the belt. Everyone's DPS legendaries got nerfed, then Ret gets a new one that is better than anything we ever had.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It is a small buff if the Ret was already the best dps in the raid and it is a small nerf if the Ret was not.<br />
<br />
All the other ability buffs really just bring other talent loadouts in-line with the basic Final Verdict build.<br />

If you need something to complain about with Ret, take a look at the changes to the belt. Everyone's DPS legendaries got nerfed, then Ret gets a new one that is better than anything we ever had.<br />
<br />
Yeah, the buff to the Ret spec itself is very minor, more to offset the loss of DPS from removing Blessing of Might, which was necessary. You are right about the Legendary buff though, it's very significant, I won't lie however that I'm not excited for it. I've gotten 4 Legendaries and they're the Belt, the Boots, the Bracers and Sephuz's. So it wasn't for that damn buff to Chains of Thrayn, I'd be pretty fucking disgusted with Legendaries right now... It's also a buff to my Prot offspec too, so it's a pretty exciting change for Paladins overall.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ret got the 12% buff to compensate for blessing of might being taken away. The other buffs were to talents that never get used. Other classes just got buffed outright.</div></div><hr />

Starting to get annoyed by this. I am still enjoying my disc priest, but I would really like to see a few changes - even minor - to really help smooth over the class. As much as I like it, both in mythic+ and raids (including mythic), it still has some major issues and feels clunky sometimes, especially in certain healing situations. Very restrictive gameplay now, which kind of gets old.</div></div><hr />

...putting cataclysm on same tier as FNB.<br />
<br />
I like my AOE, couldnt give 2 fucks about single target crap especially since all i do is world quests , old shit and general soloing stuff nowadays.<br />
For some fucked up reason this change has triggered me this time round.<br />
