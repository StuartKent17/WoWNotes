Regarding the address, it definitely links to beta.wow-europe.com. Status bar agrees when I hover it, as does address bar when I click it. It's legit, but a very boring page (the same as you all see). Hence, my assumption is that this is either fake and serves no purpose whatsoever, OR is a prematurely sent invite. Hell, I don't know, I'm not getting too excited yet. :)<br />

(e) oh, and the e-mail address is definitely no-reply@blizzard.com, but then again e-mail spoofing is incredibly easy, so you really can't interpret much from that.</div></div><hr />

Looks very fake to me, when compared to the BC beta invite. No copyright notice, no image.<br />
<br />
In GMail, click the small downward arrow next to Reply, and click &quot;Show Original&quot;. This will include the header information of the mail. Amoung the headers you should find some Received: lines, you can use those to check the mail servers the mail has been through. If it's legit it should start from a blizzard mail server.<br />
<br />
For instance a line like this is a good sign:<br />
Received: from eu-smtp01.blizzard.com (eu-smtp01.blizzard.com [80.239.174.216])<br />
* * * * by mx.google.com with ESMTP id XXXXXX<br />
<br />
Ohh, another thing: EU WoW team uses noreplyeu@blizzard.com as the sender.</div></div><hr />

So... anyways... I saw a blue comment after they announced the beta opt-in that made it appear that they would be starting beta shortly after releasing the Frostmourne contest winners. So it's probably not a coincidence that they just announced the EU contest winners and will be releasing the US winners sometime soon (http://blue.cardplace.com/newcache/us/8122762861.htm) and now they're prepping the beta webpage. Total speculation of course but I'm super excited and really crossing my fingers for a beta invite.</div></div><hr />
