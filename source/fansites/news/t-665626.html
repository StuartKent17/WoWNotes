It is. :(<br />
<br />
I was hoping that it'd be a new model, which would indicate that they might be adding Pandaria to the game finally. Oh well, maybe next expansion.<br />
<br />
(I know a big issue preventing the Pandaren being in the game is one of China's stupid laws, but they could always do it and just replace the models with trolls or something for the Chinese version.)</div></div><hr />

<br />
However, I think it would be appropriate for the Pandaran Monk to be a new Brewfest reward as the event is supposed to be getting another makeover this year. (Among other things, I THINK there's talk about making the 60% mounts available along with a new mount.)<br />
<br />
But Pandarans seem to go well with Brewfest. And the beauty of pets is, they've already released China-exclusive pets so having a Pandaran NOT released in China would be fairly doable.<br />
<br />
Maybe a reward, purchased with Brewfest prize tokens, available only to Brewmasters, similar to the Argent Tournament's Crusader-only rewards. Would be fitting since Pandarans are the original Brewmasters.<br />
<br />
Here's hoping it's full Tuskarr-sized though. Maybe with the side benefit/drawback that, similar to the Disgusting Oozling's stench aura, the Pandaran Brewmaster pet constantly throws you bottles, keeping you drunk while he's summoned.</div></div><hr />

It's really more of an issue with Pandaren wearing Samurai clothing - because Pandas are native to China, but they get very offended at the idea of them in Japanese clothing. It's the crux of the whole argument, so it's basically solved by... not putting Pandaren in Samurai armor.</div></div><hr />

Will we have any chance to refund or a direct replacement? Would be fairly upright.<br />

To put it simply: &quot;no&quot;. Blizzard haven't refunded currency for items manually after nerfing or buffing items, and I doubt they's start now.</div></div><hr />

Totem of Quaking Earth (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/47667/totem-of-quaking-earth/) now gives 400 attack power for 18 sec each time you use your Lava Lash ability. (Up from 200 Attack Power)<br />

Well, finally I can buy that damned totem now. Though once again Blizzard fails at communication, as there were numerous threads in the Shaman/Bug Report/DD-Forums addressing this issue without eliciting a reply from Blizzard staff.<br />
Now countless fellow enhancers who bought the clearly superior elemental totem (I didn't, btw) will have to beg GMs to trade back their totems.</div></div><hr />

Don't feel too bad, the death knight's sigil uselessness for blood spec still hasn't been adressed by blizz anywhere. Personally I think that whoever designed it had a brain fart and forgot that death knights were forced to use death strike over obliterate in patch 3.1.</div></div><hr />

I was quite upset when this came out.. so I did some browsing and found a post on the official EU WoW Suggestion forums with a blue response saying &quot;working as intended.&quot; I then went and purchased the clearly superior elemental totem. I will be petitioning GM's until they refund my tokens or switch the totem. I don't really care that I have more than enough tokens to buy it - there were countless threads on day 1 of 3.2 and it took them until now to fix it... completely unacceptable.</div></div><hr />

just notice the body build, it's pretty much the same as a tuskarr, which imo is unfit for a playable char. yes it's just a small pet, but none the less it's the pandaren's first appearance in the game, and only as a small promotional item, which says it all really.. but who knows, hopefully some future expansion will prove me wrong</div></div><hr />

They simply didn't want blood DK to get a new sigil.<br />

<br />
Current Master Poisoner gives 15/30/45% higher chance of applying Deadly Poison (DP) after Envenom<br />
<br />
The new Master Poisoner gives Envenom 33/66/100% chance NOT to consume DP stacks on target.<br />
<br />
Essentially, the 45% higher application chance after Envenom was practically a useless effect as you could only really use it to boost your application rate when switching targets directly after an envenom which is situational at best. And so it was removed. It really won't make a difference unless you are constantly switching between 2 boss mobs within the 4-5 seconds of the Envenom buff.</div></div><hr />

People who don't like pandas need more help. I LURV PANDAS. ;)<br />

Though I will agree, they need to modify this further to look more Pandaren and less Tuskarr. I loved the Pandaren back in Warcraft 3. The pet needs a jug or a keg, not just a silly little hip flask.<br />

I was of the opinion that Pandaren Monks could have been a hero class (right next to the Goblin Mecha Pilot). That way they'd be different from the DK, which could be of any race --- this one is of course race-locked. Though they traditionally associated with the Horde lore-wise in WC3, they're technically a neutral race, so either faction could have obtained them. I suppose that as a playable race, the Pandaren are one of the future options Blizzard has to use, which is why they're holding back on us (boo). <br />
<br />
Whether faction-specific or a hero race/class, I'm looking forward to the day when I can smash someone's face in with a container of whisky. ;D</div></div><hr />

<br />
The only thing about the Pandaren that upset the Chinese was how they were originally dressed in traditional Japanese samurai garb. Once that was fixed (back in the warcraft III era), the Chinese had no beef with them.<br />
<br />
I think the only issues had with Warcraft or WoW were the exposed bones in the Undead models, bones all over the grounds, and a few other gore issues like severed head icons and the like.</div></div><hr />

Many people want them just because they want a monk class in the game. Many others want them because they like Pandas. Some actually like the mythos surrounding them.<br />
<br />
As for &quot;disliking them because they suck,&quot; you're basically saying you dislike them because... you dislike them. Circular logic fails, so there must be some deep seated reason for your illogical hatred. Were you molested by a panda when you were younger?</div></div><hr />

No, seriously. There's nothing new or exciting about Goblins, while Pandaren would perfectly match the Worgen-Coolness-Factor.<br />

<br />
China and Japan have hated each other for centuries. You're only a descendant of the Germans, so your argument isn't really that good. If you were an actual German living in Germany, and some game had a race that depicted the Nazis, you'd be pretty damn upset. It's the same exact thing with China/Japan, even if you don't think so.<br />
<br />
You have to also take in account that Nazis and Hitler are far more important to us than to Asia. They only think of him as a historical figure, not the embodiment of Satan most Westerners characterize him as (Hell, Japan even has bars named after the guy just because they think they'll get more customers if they have historical name slapped on their front door).<br />
<br />
What you think isn't a big deal in your eyes may be completely opposite on the other side of the globe (which is the case for a lot more than you may think).<br />
<br />
Asians are some of the most racist people on the planet (Go there if you don't believe me, you'll find out), so it really is no surprise why China would get upset if one their most beloved animals were dressed like one of their most hated enemies.</div></div><hr />

Though once again Blizzard fails at communication, as there were numerous threads in the Shaman/Bug Report/DD-Forums addressing this issue without eliciting a reply from Blizzard staff.<br />
Now countless fellow enhancers who bought the clearly superior elemental totem (I didn't, btw) will have to beg GMs to trade back their totems.<br />
<br />
<br />
The key to any successful GM swap conversation is to point out the 234 bonus healing. If the totem had been only giving 200AP, GMs could argue that this is a buff and therefore does not necessitate them making an exchange from the Ele totem. The bonus healing aura clearly highlights that the totem was broken and that the change was a fix rather than a buff. This argument should hold more water for those looking to make the swap.<br />
<br />
I took advantage of the 2 hour vendor swap for a few days to test out both T9 relics and found that while ToEW was superior, keeping the buff up was so difficult in all but completely stationary fights it just was not worth the effort. Rather than the 70-80% potential uptime, my typical uptime was around 45% and even that ruled out using MW5_CL when it would clearly be superior to a LB. After a Ulduar full-clear and a few heroics, I permanently moved to ToQE as it was a decent upgrade from the Deadly Gladiator's relic. (though not really worth 25 emblems)</div></div><hr />

If Blizzard is catering to China, the version number of Cataclysm will not be &quot;4&quot;. If the version number is &quot;4&quot; then you know they are NOT catering to China. OK?<br />
<br />
I don't see a particular problem with that either way.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Or my reading english is no so high leveled up or I do understand that they have just nerfed the master poisoner?<br />
<br />
Please I need some translation.... gods<br />
<br />
<br />
The changed it because of the other new effect they gave it that if you have 3 points in it envenom no longer consumes Deadly poison.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They claim the game teaches people how to make biological weapons.<br />
<br />
That's absolutely an incredibly dumb reason not to include them in the game up to this point, but I believe it. China is wacked. It would be like the british getting offended if a dude in a revolution uniform was walking around in a game they play. Ridiculous. Age of Empires ftw.<br />
<br />
<br />
China doesn't want to have wow because then a filthy American game will be the top played MMO, and the Asian region is kinda the starter of the business so its an insult to their honour blablabla.</div></div><hr />

<br />
ofc this is just speculation, but with the addition of monk to Diablo 3 (http://www.blizzard.com/diablo3/characters/monk.xml), I strongly feel that monk is a very viable choice for the next hero class.<br />
<br />
My second guess would be Runemaster, tattooed martial arts/runic master.</div></div><hr />

Pandaren are an overrated novelty.<br />
