How does capping characters at 50 = more money from race changing?<br />
<br />
o.O</div></div><hr />

<br />
Shows how much solid reasoning there is behind your arguments.<br />
<br />
Race changing doesn't affect the 50 character cap on an account.</div></div><hr />

I'd rather page through different pages than scroll, but I'll take what I can get.<br />
<br />
Maybe some day blizzard would let me spend boatloads of cash to transfer all my characters to a single server. Keep the 50 character cap but lift the per server cap.<br />
<br />
But like I said I'll take what I can get!</div></div><hr />

Yep if they can squeeze bucks out of everyone who has 50 characters that are all too important to delete, they can definitely increase revenue by at least 0.00000001%</div></div><hr />

Now it is just time to wait until they redesign the character select screen like they said at Blizzcon. Hopefully with a new design we can get 50 characters per server and enough room so they don't need that dorky scroll wheel design that they just implemented.</div></div><hr />

You CAN pay to increase your total characters ... by adding another account. &lt;facepalm&gt;</div></div><hr />
