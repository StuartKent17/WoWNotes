Legion - Warlock Tier 19<br />
Today we are taking a look at the Warlock Tier 19 sets. They go nicely with the Warlock Artifact weapons (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/985-Legion-Artifact-Weapons#warlock)! <br />

Legion - Flame Orb<br />
A recent build updated the model used for Flame Orb (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/194461-flame-orb). This orb follows players at all times while they have Felo'melorn (http://beta.wowdb.com/items/128820-felomelorn) equipped unless they have spent all of the charges.<br />

Greater Blessing of Might<br />
Maybe the developers themselves could chime in here, but it seems obvious to me that both Rets and Enhance shaman will have their own damage output reduced to account for the extra damage they are providing to other players. That just seems obvious to me, since if the specs do as much damage as other melee DPS while also providing 10% more damage to other players, people will stack only those melee classes to the exclusion of all else.<br />
Stormlash and Greater Blessings are indeed intended to be numerically valuable contributions to group success from Enhancement and Retribution (part of their fantasy is in buffing their allies). Their damage or other effects should be attributed to the Enhancement/Retribution player, as far as contribution to the group's damage goes. We'll ensure that the combat logging events are there to allow this to be done.<br />
<br />
EDIT: We still welcome feedback/discussion on these abilities, of course. Just wanted to clear up the question of how their effects should be attributed. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/400686-greater-blessing-of-might-is-awful-design/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/20420284478?page=2#30))<br />

Ghostcrawler Tweets<br />
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br />
Curious: How many expansions in advance did you work on? Do you know what comes after Legion for example?<br />
At the end of MoP, we had WoD mostly planned and Legion discussed. (I found out its name when you did though.) (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/691465327222259712))<br />
I don't know what comes after Legion. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/691465453361717248))<br />
<br />
or continued to do, WoD was announced 11.8.13 you left in December, you saying you didn't work on WoD?<br />
I did but very little. I playtested a few quests. We had some rough ideas for garrisons. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/692064052420280320))<br />
<br />
Sort of relevant, but why is bring back eyes of the beast so hard? Why can't they program it now when you...<br />
It's not hard. It's just not free. A week of that engineer's time is a week she's not working on something else. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/691465928622546946))<br />

If that is the case....the nonmythic set looks like crap this time around (imo: looks like LFR gear, not a tier), but the Mythic looks freaking amazing.</div></div><hr />

Otherwise mythic wouldn't be either<br />
<br />
Its something for people who can get to that level to work towards and obtain. Looking unique for your place is something people have asked for ages, but people are too busy being venomous when they do get it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Pretty much this, some of the mythic sets just completely out do the normal/heroics sets like priest or lock. Then other mythic sets look like a subtle upgrade from normal/heroic such as Shaman,rogue, or pally.</div></div><hr />

Disappointed that fire mages are going to have some orb following them around. I really dislike (combat) pets and was looking forward to being able to escape frost and the water elemental in Legion. Now I learn I'm going to be stuck with some other thing following me around...</div></div><hr />

Some of the other sets have a decent &quot;upgrade&quot; like a promotion. Warlocks look like they're paupers that suddenly win the lottery.<br />

I much prefer the subtle/slight upgrades.</div></div><hr />

It should look better. Besides, it's not exactly a limited time item. What if you REALLY wanted the Heroic Tier colors from a previous exp and you weren't a heroic raider? You just go back and solo farm it now. It's no different now, just that there's an extra visual. There should be reasons to push harder... <br />

This is of course hyperbole, but would you rather just have the best looking stuff handed to you day 1 when you log in?</div></div><hr />

You can tell Greg Street no longer works at Blizzard. Blizz has been running like hell away from the &quot;You will lose a raid wing if we do X too&quot; excuse for the past year. It really made them sound like a weak, behind the tech curve, inept company and horrible at their jobs.</div></div><hr />

Good thing we dont &quot;have&quot; to play their game if we dont like it .If enough people do the old wallet vote they will do backflips for you ;-) .<br />

<br />
If some or all of the increased dps to others from your buff is attributed to you rather than them, your direct dps could be smaller but no one would know or care. You would look even in the logs and meters. That didnt happen in Vanilla or TBC, but is what the blue said they were looking into doing. Wait and see if it works before you dive off that cliff</div></div><hr />
