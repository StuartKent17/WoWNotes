1, the polar bear from 2008.<br />
<br />
Year before that was the best reward ever, the Murloc costume.</div></div><hr />

To be fair, I sort of put blizzcon and CE mounts together in my head for some reason, might not have been fair. Still prefer the blizzard bear :p<br />
<br />
I see that I am in the clear minority with my distaste for floating mini ship mounts, and that's perfectly alright haha I just really like &quot;living creatures&quot;. My main classes are druid and hunter for something, I suppose.</div></div><hr />

<br />
BlizzCon® In-Game Goodies<br />
Every BlizzCon, we give out awesome in-game loot to commemorate the occasion, and this year is no exception! Purchase a Virtual Ticket, and once BlizzCon begins you'll have access to a treasure trove of in-game goodies, including a World of Warcraft mount with Horde and Alliance variants! Keep an eye out for more details on this year's in-game goodies.<br />
So clearly there's more to come. Since Murky's been a Blizzcon thing for years, I wouldn't be surprised to see something tied to the next expansion. So probably the reason why they haven't announced Murky yet is because it could spoil the expansion reveal. Pirate Murky? Mage Murky? Naga Murky? Void Murky?<br />
<br />
And chances are the other games will get Blizzcon items, too. They just haven't been revealed yet. Still got about 7 weeks to Blizzcon. There's no reason for Blizzard to spoil everything out of the gate.<br />
<br />
Not sure how I feel about the mounts. Unless they're passenger mounts, they'll likely just go into my collection and collect dust. Just not my style. Might just use them on my engineers. They're pretty cool but with the names, I was honestly expecting a white recolor of the new armored gryphon and a blue or green recolor (or even a red one) of the new armored windrunner ... and for them to not be Blizzcon mounts. Was expecting them more as a tie-in to the next expansion as rewards related to a quest chain like the iron starlette and vampiric batling. Looking at the images of the mounts, does appear they are passenger mounts. They have seats right behind the characters. Why have those if they're not passenger mounts? Strange decoration. But I can see the complaints regarding that. Why promote flying passenger mounts at Blizzcon if they keep taking flying away?<br />
<br />
I'm happier now than I was yesterday with the Blizzcon goodies since I was disappointed it looked like all I'd be getting is a backpack and some dolls. First year I'm going to Blizzcon and was hoping for something more substantial, but guess we'll see. Not everything is out yet.</div></div><hr />

I can confirm that the Alliance gunship *can* be used on Argus in a ground strafing attack mode.<br />
<br />
/mountspecial FTW! :D<br />
<br />
Yes, it has moving cannons, plus two deployable skids it occasionally lands on when idling on the ground.<br />
<br />
Edit: For those of you, who know the engineering gyro-copters: The Alliance mount moves like that, just with four cannons, a passenger seat, better audio, is larger and has more propellers.</div></div><hr />

It's not a coupon, just gotta be logged into your Battle.net account<br />

&quot;This year, you don’t need a Virtual Ticket to order—but as a bonus, Virtual Ticket holders can pre-purchase the Goody Bag at an automatically discounted price of $35—just log in to the Blizzard Gear Store on the Blizzard account you used to purchase your Virtual Ticket.&quot;</div></div><hr />

Honestly with the way things are aquatic mounts are more useful than flying in this day and age, if these are all three which they should be, that's fine. But flying mounts are horse shit, they are better off giving people ground mounts in the new world order.</div></div><hr />

yea, i hate to say it but im going to resub just to fly that mount after paying for virtual ticket.

Buy it and.. i love it! Awesome thanks Blizzard (but i still want murloc pet).<br />
<br />
i would literally trade all the murloc pets for these mounts in a heartbeat. Dont get me wrong, i do love some of them like the first one with the bugs bunny/frog dance and grunty and murkalot the little paladin but they are just another pet that occasionally can do something random that is mildly amusing. The mounts have an on demand special that i wanted so bad on the engineering rocket mount i made in mists of pandaren. Remember that mount that had a gun on it but didnt fire?<br />

Or someone could just buy 2x WoWToken for 275,000g each and buy a Virtual Ticket for € 30 of store credit, they save 450,000g and have €10 credit spare for a pet.</div></div><hr />

Technically two mounts, one for each faction. So it's $20 for each. Good deal.</div></div><hr />

Mounts are out now mate. You get these when you buy the ticket. They are on my account now because I bought a VT for friends so they can come by my house while I'm away at Blizzcon and watch it on my TV. :)<br />

That's funny because there's only been 1 other Blizzcon mount and that was 9 years ago.<br />
<br />
I'd happily take 2 airships over a bear with a murloc on it.</div></div><hr />

Eu tokens only redeem for €12.99 so you unfortunately have to buy 3. Same for UK, Redeem for £10 and Ticket costs £25</div></div><hr />

Still considerably cheaper and less scam-prone than the 1,000,000g the other guy was offering.</div></div><hr />

Yes, It still considerably low. I am thinking to buy one. Why I am thinking about? Because I love total guide (https://totalguide.org/) or value they provide like live coverage blizzcon channel coverage etc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I got the mount right away after purchasing the virtual ticket. ;)</div></div><hr />
