<br />
BlizzCon Live Raid: Method vs. Midwinter<br />
At BlizzCons past, the World of Warcraft Live Raid has proven to be a spectacle of pure entertainment and roar-inducing gameplay mastery. BlizzCon 2013’s live raid challenge is sure to be no exception with #1-worldwide ranked 25-player Horde guild Method (http://www.wowprogress.com/guild/eu/twisting-nether/Method/rating.tier16_25) (EU-Twisting Nether) squaring off against #1-worldwide ranked 25-player Alliance guild Midwinter (http://www.wowprogress.com/guild/us/sargeras/Midwinter/rating.tier16_25) (US-Sargeras). These two teams of exceptionally skilled raiders will be racing through 25-player Heroic Siege of Orgrimmar to tackle five encounters that will make for an especially exciting spectator experience. The winning guild will be the first to best all five, including Sha of Pride, the Kor’kron Dark Shaman, Malkorok, Siegecrafter Blackfuse, and the infamous Garrosh Hellscream himself.<br />
<br />
Midwinter and Method raced each other for the first time in September during Athene’s “The Siege (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/blog/10893289)” live marathon event, and while Method came out of the Throne of Thunder victorious, the deciding factor may have come early on with Midwinter’s slightly messy handling of Jin’rokh at the start of the race. As Method was later overcome by the unforgiving machinations of Dark Animus, and Midwinter positioned themselves to take the lead—that is, until Dark Animus dealt equal punishment to the U.S.-based guild. When all was said and done, Ra-den fell just two minutes too late for Midwinter to claim the bragging rights that day. (Watch the full Throne of Thunder race VoD (http://youtu.be/ABZqI875gW8).)<br />
<br />
Method also claims the world-first Heroic 25-player Garrosh kill, finishing him off a mere nine days before Midwinter completed their siege on Orgrimmar. But if history is any indication for these two guilds, a single mistake in any of the five intense encounters we’ve selected could spell defeat for either team.<br />
<br />
If you’re attending BlizzCon 2013 in person, join us Saturday morning at 10 a.m. PST in Hall D (http://us.battle.net/blizzcon/en/event-info/schedule/saturday-schedule) to witness the epic battle—otherwise, you can tune in to watch the race live from the comfort of your home with the Virtual Ticket (http://us.battle.net/blizzcon/en/virtual-ticket/). World of Warcraft lead encounter designer Ion “Watcher” Hazzikostas will be joined on stage by community manager Josh “Lore” Allen to provide commentary on the Live Raid. In addition, we’ll have Method members Rogerbrown, Sco, and Justwait, and Midwinter members Slootbag, Dpsonroids, and Pravity leading their teams directly from the stage.<br />
<br />
You just don’t want to miss this. Simple as that!<br />

Siegecrafter Blackfuse Adds Health<br />
We had made several rounds of tuning changes to the various Siege of Orgrimmar encounters late in the 5.4 PTR process, and some health adjustments that were reverted before 5.4 was released ended up resurfacing in patch 5.4.1. Apologies for the inconvenience -- this should be corrected within the next day.

Are you planning to keep the current spec and talent system in the expansion? Cause I, for one, love it!<br />
While I can't talk about future expansions, overall we are happy with the current spec and talent design. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/389859476557148161))<br />
you did especially good job with the mage 90 talents<br />
Like many of our systems, there is certainly room for improvement on specific talents. The system overall is a keeper though. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/390988081349681152))<br />
<br />
The new talents are way too stripped compared to old one, it used to be fun while leveling. now it's (15 more )<br />
We think the new talents are better overall, but they do make leveling slightly less rewarding. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/390986431046234113))<br />
The question is whether talents are supposed to add max level customization or leveling rewards. We went with the former. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/390986559668752384))<br />
<br />
while the 3 or 4 people here like the new talent design the 5 million who quit didnt, as well as millions in game<br />
If something that seems so obvious to you is not obvious to others, at least consider that it, in fact, might not be true. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/390930075169738752))<br />
<br />
Flex Raiding<br />
Do you think difficulty is more appropriate or is it the flexibility. Does NM still have a place in future?<br />
Overall I think the flexibility, because there already was an easier raid version. Flex lets them run with (just) their friends. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/390985742316367872))<br />
<br />
Would you encourage players to socialize-PuG instead of LFD? Eg. offering rewards (more VP, money, drops). #warcraft<br />
We're doing that a bit already with Flex. The message we want to send is LFR is fine and good, but maybe try this other thing.... (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/390942023487725568))<br />

Really? Method vs Midwinter? Method will stomp them, no competition. It should Method vs Blood Legion; now that's what I want to see.<br />
<br />
They obviously wanted it to be horde vs alliance. I doubt they will stomp them though. They both got their strategies down now so the only thing they have to do is fine tune them. And Method being 9 days faster maybe has more to do with how much and how efficiently they raid.</div></div><hr />

Blood Legion is good, but I really dislike how they run their ship. It works for them, and I can respect that. <br />
<br />
In any sense, don't count on Method facerolling Midwinter. Like was said earlier- there's much less luck factored in now versus the release race. And it won't come down to number of hours/pulls spent, but rather strategy perfection.</div></div><hr />

LOL yea I got a giggle out of that.<br />
<br />
Re-introducing short term buffs after the player base took years to convince them it just was not fun is a pretty good indicator that the current development team is out of ideas and is just regurgitating the original teams development.<br />
<br />
I can hardly wait for warlock drain tanking and hunter ammo, even better maybe a class should get 5 minute buffs they can give other raid members depending on their class.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Honestly, was more nerfs to LFR really needed? Maybe Garrosh for now, but Iron Jugg etc? <br />
<br />
I'll be following Method, they are good at this, but Midwinter aren't exactly far behind or a pushover so, it will be interesting to watch, as races have shown in the past, one guild can be ahead 95% of the entire run, then boom, wipe, other team pulls ahead.<br />
<br />
Can't wait for Blizzcon, is there a cut off date to buy a virtual ticket or is it just up until the first day?<br />

For the most part, especially after you see how many attempts it takes some of these guilds, it's not a matter of how skilled they are at playing the game, rather how much time they have to sit in a dungeon for extended periods of time. Back in the day of MMOs, you couldn't slam your head against the raiding wall for 4 days straight because if you did, you deleveled, and then it was impossible to raid. I'm not trying to take anything away from these folks' accomplishments, I'm really not. But lets stop acting like it took skill and not copious amounts of time to make it where they are. Show me a guild that beats the new tier of raiding first, with no practicing on the PTR, AND they kill every boss within 10 attempts, and then we can talk. Till then......meh.</div></div><hr />

um no, no its not<br />

The sound of sarcasm going right over the devs heads<br />

The talent system has become the exact opposite of what they said when they announced the rewamp.</div></div><hr />

Which is why he said 'like many of our systems, there is certainly room for improvement on specific talents'. Which means he was acknowledging the 90 mage talents not working out. But hey, speaking of going over somebody's head, right?</div></div><hr />

Read about it just yesterday, and I can't wait to see both in action! Loved the previous stream (PTR), and I do also think it's a wonderful way to show to the rest of the people interested in the raiding aspect of the game what two really organised and focused teams can do!<br />
<br />
Bring it on, but no &quot;invis&quot; this time plx lol</div></div><hr />

Well, that's a little unfounded. Especially considering that Blizzard has been openly supporting this:<br />
http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/747939120/starcraft-universe<br />
<br />
The guy's actually going to turn a profit on his StarCraft map. As long as these maps require people to purchase copies of StarCraft to play them, however, Blizzard has no incentive to do anything BUT support them.</div></div><hr />
