So ... Blizzard is still stuck with that old archaic way of thinking.<br />

<br />
What i want to hear is not something that also can be asked and answered in every online forum, but<br />
<br />
Why the switch from Karabor/Bladespire to Fort Copypasta/Zugzug-huts?<br />
Can we see maybe more events in the future like in the Blasted Lands; or maybe new threats in existing Zones that let us go back in the old zones to face new challenges (and switch to the old one via Zidormi or a new system)<br />
Can we get more fun spells that add flavor to our class?<br />
Might we see more interactive Events that adds more RP-Factor in this game? (the Wanderer Festival in Mists of Pandaria is an good example for it)<br />
Can you refrain from destroying a zone like Vale of Eternal Blossoms without a way to turn it back?<br />
<br />
There are so many questions that would actually be useful because only they can answer it, but instead we get questions like who are the big baddies; whoa old gods and Sargeras, something we already know since when, vanilla?</div></div><hr />

Q&amp;A at Blizzcon is usually this bad, yes. The art panels are usually okay, but not the rest.<br />
<br />
A couple years ago they had a lore Q&amp;A and people kept getting in line and asking gameplay questions.</div></div><hr />

because you have people introducing themselves as their character then asking if they can record a real bear for druids.</div></div><hr />

It's like they go through all of Blizzcon and select the weirdest people in the entire room and tell them a question to ask during Q&amp;A.<br />
<br />

<br />
Well people have asked about it for years now and the answer is always the same: It's a technical limitation, due to the way it's implemented in game it's not easily changed and would be a large task for little gain in their eyes.</div></div><hr />

There is an obsession with a Patchwerk DPS balance, even though there aren't any fights like that anymore. Balancing DPS on a Patchwerk fight would not be balanced in most actual fights. Balance isn't perfect, the team can make mistakes, so keep the feedback coming.<br />
Portal roulette is not fun for non-mages.*<br />
<br />
Not really a big surprise. That's why easy rotation classes that can deal damage while moving do much better on live servers on average than those with difficult priority lists that lose a lot of dps while moving. Bots at patchwerk always make the right decision in milliseconds and don't have to move....humans and encounters aren't like that. The easier a class is to play the closer most will come to the perfect bot results.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, I think this Blizzcon has been 100% confirmation that they're done trying. They have no idea where they're taking this next.<br />
<br />
Their response about the next person dying and timelines and whatever else I didn't follow was basically just a way to try and create hype.<br />
<br />
I don't know. So pointless.<br />
<br />
Clearly they've been funneling all of their effort and funds into Overwatch whether the teams are supposedly different or not.<br />

<br />
That's it as far as I know.<br />
<br />
It's like went through the time rift with Garrosh and he dropped us off at 2013.<br />
<br />
Somebody got a Garrosh Back to the future Delorean meme?<br />
<br />
But you can't expect much anyway. As silent and evasive as they are about genuine questions over the internet, can't really expect them to do anything but censor the questions they have to answer in person. They don't want too many people asking too many uncomfortable questions about the future because it will become painfully obvious how little they themselves actually know about the future. If they get asked like 10 questions about future patches or expansions or the lore, and then have no response, they're left looking clueless which isn't reassuring.<br />
<br />
Still seems kind of weird that they wouldn't just come right out and say Eye of Azshara isn't a real thing. But then again it creates hype or the fan base so they might just be riding that as long as they can.</div></div><hr />

Because they are good scape goats and it makes it easy for them to look more intelligible in comparison? Because it means they get to answer questions that aren't challenging or thought provoking?<br />

lol <br />

I'm assuming something along those lines. Just makes it easier on them than possibly saying something they don't want to say or will regret having said later.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And some put in so much information that doesn't relate to the actual question. Like, &quot;My question is about transmog. I main a paladin who is transmogged to tier 2. He's ret and I am GM of my guild. BT is my favorite raid.

<br />
I don't mind the odd silly question because it adds a bit of humour to it, but quite a lot of the questions asked were really pointless. The eyebrows and the bacon... come on, they should save that for Twitter or something.<br />
<br />
I would've preferred class specific questions, that's usually the best bit of these Q&amp;A panels. Maybe they should have 2 panels next Blizzcon, one for general questions and one just for class-related questions.</div></div><hr />

seriously, i am shocked... how do you put your clothes on in the morning?<br />
<br />
If you have such disdain for PvE perhaps you should find a game where PvP wasn't built in as an afterthought with lower priority than the rest of the content. Try GW2 or DAoC if you want great PvP. I even hear Wildstar's PvP is great. WoWs PvP hasn't been balanced in 10 years and no reason to think that's going to change. <br />
<br />
My question is if the game is so shitty then why haven't you moved on to something that you think isn't shit? Judging by the attitude of your comments I don't think many would mind if you did.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Gee, you sure got us there. Your question wasn't bad, but don't get all high and mighty just because you went this year. <br />
<br />
<br />
I love the QnA but these questions were absolutely ridiculous. I play on Moonguard, but god damn I wanted to slap those RPers. She wanted to know how long it takes to fly from the North of Kalimdor to the South if you were actually in Azeroth!?!! Like, in miles!? Wtf. <br />
<br />
First off, long winded questions. If you want answers, ask a precise question. Don't sit there and make it up on the spot. &quot;Well. Um. Uh. Um. This and this and this, but what about this and that and this and um that and secondly....&quot;Ugh so frustrating.<br />
<br />
Bacon? Stupid. <br />
Thrall's eyebrows. Stupid. <br />
Is Azeroth in a nebulous cluster or a spiral galaxy? Wtf....<br />
Little kid? God he was so cute up until he dropped that bomb of a spoiler <br />
<br />
I think Red shirt guy asked the only question that had anything to do with WoW.</div></div><hr />

I'm sorry you thought my question was stupid. What if I phrased it differently or added more onto it?<br />
<br />
&quot;Do orcs shave their eyebrows because its a cultural thing? Is there significance behind it or is it strictly a 'race design' choice?&quot;<br />
<br />
I'll admit my question was silly, but there could've been some value to it.<br />
<br />
edit: going through this thread, someone linked a pic of a different orc with eyebrows. So I'm glad I'm technically wrong but I do think there's still some value to the question.</div></div><hr />

Oh geeh, I don't know, maybe because I'm 14 and 1/2 hour away BY FLIGHT and I don't have the time nor excessive income to afford that. Just because people were able to go and ask questions, doesn't mean that their questions were good. <br />
<br />
And some posters here HAVE posted great questions. And calling the questions asked silly is a huge understatement. Bacon? Eyebrows? Is travel time intended? That one guy also had a customer service complaint! That's not silly, that's dumb.</div></div><hr />

I'm aware of physics thank you. I understand that being on the other side of the country means that I will, believe it not, be unable to ask a question in California.<br />
<br />
Regardless of that fact however, the questions were still terrible.</div></div><hr />

I had questions about the Alliance chopper (why so expensive ?), the random mount button (why don't put one for pets ?), the collections (what about tabards and heirlooms collections ?), and about Stampede (why did they put it as a talent ? it was so cool as a basic spell, it's a dilemma to have to choose between this but not so effective talent and another effective but not cool at all spell)<br />
<br />
The Alliance chopper is so expensive because the Alliance lost the contest. Already answered.<br />
<br />
They would like to put a random pet button in in the future. Already answered.<br />
<br />
They would like to address tabard collections but some of them have special uses which makes it difficult to implement. Already answered. <br />
<br />
Heirlooms? I don't recall them saying anything about them, but then we don't really need separate storage for EVERY damned thing in the game. The bank is useless if NOTHING is stored in there.<br />
<br />
They changed Stampede to a talent to make the talent choice at that level more interesting/meaningful. Already answered.<br />
<br />
Yes, the questions were pretty awful for the most part during the Q&amp;A, but from what I've seen here the majority of questions pulled from the forums wouldn't have been much better. Do some basic research and you answer most of them yourselves.</div></div><hr />

Joking aside, people need to lay off on the questionable questions... We weren't allowed to ask many things and people came up with what they could on the spot. Not to mention standing up there and seeing and hearing yourself in front of tens of thousands of people can create some akwardness. You can say all you want hiding behind a pc , go there and be the forum hero you think you can be. Can't afford to go?

Yes, I will devout all my time and money to travel to Blizzcon to get to ask one question...<br />
<br />
There is a Q&amp;A (almost?) every Blizzcon, and people can't be bothered to think about what question they are gonna ask before they get in line?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Basically what Natureseer said. There were a few topics we weren't allowed to ask about (the panelists specifically said no class-related questions). The screener would also let you know if your question had already been asked before (or was going to be asked). But that was it. No specified format for asking the question was given.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The eyebrows on Thrall are a unique (or near-unique, if you count the Cinematic Orc) trait. Stuff like that is interesting and usually done for a reason, the given answer being to humanize Thrall a bit and reflect that he was raised by humans. There's also the opposite that's being asked: why do orcs shave (or remove, if they don't shave them) their eyebrows? <br />
<br />
This next expansion, we're going to learn a lot about orcs. We're going to learn what drives them to do what they do and what choices they make. We'll learn about their culture, about their thoughts and feelings, traditions, motivations, history. We're going to learn why some were designed visually the way they were. I doubt we'll learn about eyebrows (or maybe Blizzard got enough of a chuckle that they might add something about it, idk) but I'm almost positive this question was never brought to the devs prior to this past weekend. The value, in my mind, is that the developers got to think about something maybe they didn't think about before, if only for a moment. In return, we got a bit of information about a unique trait of an important character.<br />
<br />
Was it important information (comparative to other questions that were asked or the desires of the internet)? Absolutely not. I don't think it'll affect the story or character of Thrall in anyway. But its a neat little tidbit and some people get kicks out of that stuff.<br />
<br />
tl;dr is the underlined</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jasper Kazai</div><div class="date">2014-11-10, 04:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;The team can make one click milling and prospecting if it is something players want.&quot;<br />
<br />
Is that a joke? Who doesn't want that? I'm constantly using the auto feature in Enchantrix (which works with milling and prospecting too). I don't see why anyone would have an issue with a one-click feature if it could be disabled in the options.</div></div><hr />

It's like went through the time rift with Garrosh and he dropped us off at 2013.<br />

Somebody got a Garrosh Back to the future Delorean meme?.<br />

Perhaps. <br />
