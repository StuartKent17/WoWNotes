Playing with friends when your characters are different levels is now easier than ever with Party Sync.<br />
<br />
If you’d like to play WoW with your friends without having to worry about whether your characters’ levels are too far apart, the new Party Sync feature is for you!<br />
<br />
Relive Azeroth’s History Together<br />
When players activate Party Sync, everyone in the party becomes aligned to the same quest state and phase. By mousing over a quest in your tracker, you can see who’s on a given quest, what their progress is, and who’s ready to turn it in. You’ll also have access to a “replay quest” feature that allows players who have already completed certain quests to replay them with friends who haven’t for rewards that are appropriate to their current actual level, regardless of the original level of the quest. Quests can be replayed for rewards once a day.<br />
<br />
While most quests can be replayed, there are some exceptions. Repeatable quests, such as dailies and World Quests, can’t be replayed. We’ve also excluded some quests with story implications from being replayed. These are determined on a case-by-case basis, and may include quests like the Demon Hunter starting zone quests, or quests where you might choose to betray the Warchief (how could you!).<br />
<br />
Sync to Their Level<br />
With Party Sync, you can choose to have your level temporarily adjusted, making it so higher-level players can quest and experience outdoor content with lower-level friends as they level up.<br />
<br />
<br />
https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2019/september/thumb/partysync-1.jpg (https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2019/september/partysync-1.jpg) <br />
<br />
Accept the sync request to join your friends on their adventure!<br />
<br />
Levels will be scaled down to the cap of the expansion content your lowest-level party member qualifies for. As an example, if your lowest-level player is level 83 your level will be scaled down to level 90. However if they’re level 21, your character will be scaled down to level 60.<br />
<br />
<br />
Original WoW - Level 60<br />
The Burning Crusade - Level 80<br />
Wrath of the Lich King - Level 80<br />
Cataclysm- Level 90<br />
Mists of Pandaria - Level 90	<br />
Warlords of Draenor - Level 100	<br />
Legion - Level 110<br />
<br />
<br />
While Party Sync is active, party members’ stats are reduced and skills are limited to a set that reflects their temporary level, including disabling some items that are beyond the scope of the experience at that level. This keeps the focus on helping lower-level party members. Unlike in Timewalking, when your level is scaled through Party Sync, you will temporarily lose access to abilities and powers (such as Azerite Traits and spells, abilities, talents, and trinket effects) with requirements that exceed your reduced level.<br />

<br />
To begin Party Sync:<br />
<br />
Invite and accept players into a party.<br />
Open your Map &amp; Quest Log (hotkey: M).<br />
Click Start Party Sync in the lower-right hand corner.<br />
Have all partied players click Accept on the Party Sync confirmation dialogue box.<br />
<br />
<br />
Once all players have accepted, quest status will be synced and levels will become adjusted so you can play together!<br />
<br />
While questing in Party Sync, you may see quests you’ve already done before—those are Replay Quests! Accept them as normal and quest together, but remember that Replay Quests are temporary and go away when the Party Sync ends. Additionally, some quests can become deactivated if your group no longer meets the requirements. Quests that can’t be replayed won’t display an icon, while a grayed-out icon indicates quests that your party sync group does not qualify for that are in your log. You can’t complete these quests until you leave Party Sync. To do so, click Stop Party Sync at the bottom of the Map &amp; Quest Log.<br />

Lead with Confidence<br />
To help you help your friends, we’ve created a brand-new RAF panel in-game to help you know when to expect your next reward and given your access to Party Sync. The RAF panel also lists special activities available to players who participate in the program. Complete these in-game challenges with your recruits to earn even more rewards.<br />

Party Sync will become available when the upcoming 8.2.5 content update goes live in the next few months.<br />

Blizzard's Worgen and Goblin Model Update Preview<br />
Get ready to shapeshift your look with new worgen and goblin models and animations—coming in the 8.2.5 content update.<br />
<br />
Goblins and worgen were first introduced as playable races in World of Warcraft: Cataclysm. Since their debut, we’ve made a number of improvements to the tools and technology behind the art and animation of Azeroth—and now it’s time to give these resolute races a visual upgrade.<br />
<br />
Using the original models as inspiration, we’ve enhanced their appearances and animations while retaining the soul of the characters.<br />
<br />
Sink your teeth into these gorgeous images!<br />

Look like a million gold without spending a copper!<br />
<br />
The new models will be available as soon as the 8.2.5 content update goes live, so be sure to check them out in the wilds (or Auction Houses) then!</div></div><hr />

everything they say lately suggest that either :<br />
<br />
8.2.5 will be the last patch of expansion with 8.3 being just warfront/pvp focused patch <br />
<br />
or 9.0 will be released very very late - like november / december 2020. <br />
<br />
i personaly bet on latter because of how badly unfinieshed BfA was nad how much backlash they got because of it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
According to PTR, yes. You can do anything at that level and gain exp including quests and dungeons. <br />
<br />
You can also go into a raid like MC and it’ll scale your 5 man party down to 60. This allows you to use legendaries like Thunderfury which actually work as if you were a legitimate 60, like they can proc and everything. I really hope they expand this feature into raids at some point, using thunderfury on ptr felt so damn good for some reason. It was also actually pretty hard, we couldn’t kill any mobs as a 5 man even with current class design so it was awesome to see that too.</div></div><hr />

Not really. They put these blog posts just few days/weeks away from new patch to inform people. Anniversary was usually on November, maybe this year will be different, maybe not - it's not directly connected to patch release. Where you get info about RAF launching in November?<br />

So edgy. Obviously Blizzard is known for cuting content left and right and irregular patch releases since Ion took control ;)<br />

My hope is that this was done to prevent a big gap between xpaks, and maybe the last raid in each xpak going forward will only last as long as the previous raids before next xpak/content is released. However, this is a HOPE, lol, so I kinda doubt it.</div></div><hr />

My hope is that they pulled away from BFA and focus on the next expansion like they did with WoD when they were preparing Legion. I do believe the game needs an expansion as flashy as Legion at this point.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They were the last two models on the old models that did not get any of the quality of life updates every other race has received. Which was really odd with the goblins because they basically use the gnome rig so it was odd they did not get the same pass when the gnomes got theirs.</div></div><hr />

Well but since FFXIV has been doing it the past 5 years, they might feel motivated to also reduce the end expansion content gap to 3 and a half months. If they can, I'm sure Blizzard can as well.</div></div><hr />

No idea. I mean if your talking about herald I’d assume it does because you’re completely scaled down to the point where legendaries actually work and mobs hit very hard but I never tried so I’m not sure if you can get it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Everything scales to you as a player, so in a zone where 60 is the max level, the mobs scale up to level 60 and are equal to the player. Even When a level 40 and a level 60 are whacking the same mob, they do level equivalent damage to it and the mob does level equivalent damage to them.<br />

<br />
The zones scale to level too, though. He'd be 21 fighting lvl 21s and you'd be 60 fighting lvl 60ies, but you'd be hitting the same mob. Your gear will still help you steamroll the older content quicker than your 21 friend, but that's a bit of an incentive to invite you in the first place. Run into one of those &quot;bring 5 friends&quot; quests? Bring one friend who is geared enough to be 4 people. You can probably 3 man dungeons together with your gear. <br />
<br />
<br />
Anyhoo, I'm more interested in party sync for the potential it has with old raiding. You can scale down 25 people to 80 and do heroic ICC, etc. and all you'd need is one person at 80. If you so chose.</div></div><hr />

Ah, yes. That' the name. 'Exemplaring'. I thought you'd lose abilities above the level you've been &quot;exemplared&quot; down to, but, thinking better, I think you only lost powers if you entered a Task Force that had a max level allowed lower than your current level.</div></div><hr />

Not getting their reasoning for capping the scale down at 60, 70, 80, etc. Why would I, for example, as a level 24, want to play with a level 60?<br />

Because with the legion zone scaling it would be like leveling with a 24 who just has more ability’s.</div></div><hr />

making it personal is fine and fun of course. but it puts you in a bad light <br />
<br />
also it's really time wasting for both of you to level like that. this &quot;feature&quot; made to live only coz of new raf. and it seems that current game has nothing to offer other than replaying QUESTS with friends, pity<br />
<br />
The system isn’t useless though I already laid out how it can and will be used.<br />
<br />
Game development also isn’t an all or nothing thing even more so on a game as large as wow it’s not like they stopped every thing else to make this.<br />
<br />
Wow is a video game every thing you do in it is wasting time. Having fun with a friend is no more of a waste then any thing else you could do.<br />
<br />
Blizzard also just re released classic solely so people could replay old stuff with there friends, Mabye you missed that?</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can also go into a raid like MC and it’ll scale your 5 man party down to 60. This allows you to use legendaries like Thunderfury which actually work as if you were a legitimate 60, like they can proc and everything. I really hope they expand this feature into raids at some point, using thunderfury on ptr felt so damn good for some reason. It was also actually pretty hard, we couldn’t kill any mobs as a 5 man even with current class design so it was awesome to see that too.<br />

Sounds like this is testing for how to revamp classes in Classic and for level squish. Almost wish there was a way to do away with leveling somehow and make everything a &quot;max level&quot; zone somehow. Just make iLVL or abilities the progression. Not sure how you would even do that sort of thing but would be interesting.</div></div><hr />
