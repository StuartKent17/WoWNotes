Mob Tagging Rules and Gameplay<br />
There's no question that when spawning or quest objectives are not handled properly on our side, the tap system can create negative and anti-social experiences, wherein seeing players of your own faction nearby becomes a nuisance. We very much want to limit and rectify those situations. The most helpful thing you can do in that regard during beta is to bring to our attention specific quests or areas in which you felt competition for spawns was overly detrimental to your experience. We have a number of ways of fixing those problems, ranging from simply adding additional spawns, to dynamic spawn thresholds that ramp up density as player density increases, to making specific targets open tap.<br />
<br />
The main reason we don't embrace a fully open-tap world is that we feel that those mechanics are asocial. To be fair, that is certainly better than antisocial - no question there, and antisocial experiences usually reflect spawning and mechanics that we need to adjust. However, while a world in which everyone runs around damaging things a few times (or however much is needed to qualify for credit) may be one in which you don't feel bad about other players being around, at some point it also makes those players nearly indistinguishable from NPCs or bots with decent AI. You don't need to talk, or ask if someone has room in their group or would like to join yours. You just attack a few times, and then move on. <br />
<br />
On the other hand, mob tagging rules inherently reward and encourage social gameplay. Even in solo areas like daily quest hubs in Mists, we'd commonly see transient pickup groups form for the sake of efficiency, and stick together through that hub or maybe even another (&quot;hey, anyone up for Klaxxi after this?&quot;). But once again, it's incumbent upon us to make sure that we avoid situations where that is outweighed by negatives like competing for underspawned quest targets or objects.<br />
<br />
Philosophically, for a while now, we've made sure that any time multiple players are sent to kill a single specific target that has a respawn timer (be it named quest boss, world boss, or an event like the Battlefield: Barrens commanders in patch 5.3), the mob is open to credit for all. We're certainly open to extending that treatment where it makes sense, and where it serves to improve the overall experience. But I wouldn't expect a wholesale overhaul of our tap mechanics in the near future. <br />

Warlords of Draenor Theorycraft Discussion<br />
My theory is that for each target in the area of effect of these spells, the healing done to each target is equal to the base healing on 1-6 targets, multiplied by 6, and then divided by the number of targets within some clump check (I don't have an idea of how it does this.) This is consistent with what I saw before (in case 3 above, some dummies treated me as part of their clump number, and some didn't.)<br />
Warning, super techy theorycrafting incoming. You do *not* need to understand any of this to use these spells effectively. This info is primarily for theorycrafters.<br />
<br />
Yes. This is something we've mentioned a few times, but I don't know if has ever been fully detailed. Traditional AoE capping works by counting the number of targets hit, and dividing the capped damage amongst them. However, there are four spells for whom that logic does not work: Chi Burst, Chi Torpedo, Divine Star, Halo.<br />
<br />
They all heal targets in an area, but that area moves (usually quite quickly, but still). If I launch a Chi Burst down a line of targets, it doesn't preemptively figure out which targets it's going to hit at cast time or anything. It just launches the orb, and there is collision detection that on it that will heal each target that it collides with. That means that when the first target gets hit, none of the other targets have been hit yet, so there's no other hits to help determine how much damage/healing it should do.<br />
<br />
So, we have a different solution for these spells. They build a list at cast time of all potential targets, and a count of how many other potential targets are near each one of those targets. That count is used for the AoE capping logic.<br />
<br />
Chi Burst: Potential targets are all targets within 60yd. Clump radius is 10yd.<br />
Chi Torpedo: Potential targets are all targets within 40yd*. Clump radius is 10yd. (*was 25yd, should be *40yd in next build)<br />
Divine Star: Potential targets are all targets within 40yd. Clump radius is 18yd.<br />
Halo: Potential targets are all targets within 40yd. Clump radius is 30yd.<br />
<br />
This works, but has some downsides of gamability, and potentially AoE capping more than needed. Example: Have a clump of a dozen players. Throw a Chi Burst but mis-aim it so it only grazes a single person in the clump. It'll apply the full AoE capping in that case, even though it only healed one target.<br />
<br />
Just did a tuning pass on weapon enchants, and here are what they'll do in the next build. (See Blue Tracker for full list (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/318876-warlords-of-draenor-theorycraft-discussion/#post442))<br />
<br />
-The other day I soloed ICC and ULD with my 90 premade toons for fun, and realized that all of my damage jumped by 100-120 times, while the formula you gave before showed 16.5 as the maximum multiplier. That's where I started guessing about a new formula implemented. Testing in Firelands showed a multiplier around 30 and considering that the mob was squished to 25%, it's about the same 100-120 multiplier in total.<br />
Looks like we changed the formula to make it scale much more. I'll get new formulae for you soon.<br />
<br />
1) Darkmoon cards seem very week (620 only) compared to heroic high maul gear (655), even weaker than 5h (630 and rarely 645). What's the reason behind that?<br />
2) Why do devs decide to use 15 as the new tier difference, instead of 13 which has been used for such a long time?<br />
3) I could see 620 and 660 pvp gears (while in pvp they're 675 and 690). Are those the final versions of pvp gear progression in 6.0? If so, then that big gap is really causing some issue imo and 660 pvp gear is again &quot;necessary&quot; for pve progression now that the only better stuff than 660 is tier-2 raid gear.<br />
1) Darkmoon cards are upgradable.<br />
2) To create more differentiation and allow more gradiation within a tier.<br />
3) The very top end of PvP gear is good, but not great, for PvE. That does not make it necessary for PvE.<br />
<br />
This isn't really theorycraft, so please start a new thread to discuss that further. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/318876-warlords-of-draenor-theorycraft-discussion/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/13087818929?page=24#476))<br />
<br />
Garrison Resource Cap<br />
Just to be clear. The resource cap is a holding cap, not a weekly earning cap. There are no limits (currently) on how many resources per week you are able to earn, just that you can walk around with a maximum of 1000 on your character at any given time.<br />
<br />
We are working on more cool things to spend resources on. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/328437-garrison-resource-cap-comments-blue/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/13594639905?page=1#6))<br />

Blue Tweets<br />
Racials<br />
racials in WoD favour alliance heavily. Surely you should aim for parity rather than using them as a social engineering tool?<br />
Everything we're seeing suggests that there previously was a favor toward Horde, and now there is parity. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/491623962187546624))<br />
If have any data to suggest otherwise, we'd love to evaluate it. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/491624330204151809))<br />
<br />
Classes<br />
just curious are the class mechanics close to being worked out at this point?<br />
Close, but not all done. Still several things on our list, design-wise. Then tuning, which may involve a few more design changes. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/491362312054243328))<br />
<br />
Many classes have spec specific lvl100 talents, many also do not, any chance at adding spec-specific talents to boost flavor?<br />
It's an option in our toolbox, but not always required in order to create an interesting choice. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/491633154168348672))<br />
<br />
Is the intent still to make all three talents in a tier competitive, or are you okay with just two? 1/2<br />
Yes, all 3 talents should be competitive, though some may be more niche than others. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/491632465765621761))<br />
What is different between &quot;niche&quot; and &quot;used only in very specific circumstances that occur only 1 fight/tier&quot;?<br />
That's just a matter of extremes; of just *how* niche something is. What's the concern? (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/491713641054339072))<br />

I don't get what your problem is . Nerf the dmg but increase the energy regen. Win Win, same dmg and always stuff to press.<br />
The problem is that Windwalker is an energy based spec, and many people are forgetting the impact of that. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/491022588215189504))<br />
Making an energy based spec that's not limited by energy... Is simply not something we're going to do. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/491022899826794496))<br />
Devil's advocate - What about Mana based specs that aren't limited by Mana? Why have a Mana bar in the first place?<br />
They're limited by some other resource (sometimes that's Time), and are designed around that. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/491024664114626561))<br />
So you may as well axe some specs Mana bars, no? Or is this intended to be flavour? An homage to when it did matter?<br />
Somewhat flavor. It's a very fair criticism that most DPS with mana bars don't use mana as their primary resource. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/491028720589606912))<br />
In these cases, Mana is functionally a tertiary resource, used for offheals/utility. Presentation as primary is misleading. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/491029078745415681))<br />
<br />
any thought about monks changing their celestial guardian depending on what stance they are in, so brew get the ox not xuen?<br />
It's something we'd like to do, but would be mostly just a cosmetic change, so is low on our priority list at the moment. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/491432871312113664))<br />

Is Warlock T100 designed to allow you to choose between Infernal &amp; Doomguard by personal pref, or are they still split AoE / ST?<br />
Doomguard is single target. Infernal is AoE/Tanking. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/491077074971398144))<br />
<br />
can demo get back the old gosac only with passive fury gen attached, petless option would be nice<br />
Changes are coming to that talent slot, but not like that; sacrificing your pet is too kit-inappropriate for *Demonology*. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/491422287321509890))<br />
<br />
Why the Soul Shard cost to Soul Swap? Adds a global to each target i need to DoT. VERY costly in PvP.<br />
A global? Should be a shard cost, not a GCD cost. Soulburn isn't on the GCD. But intended to be high cost. Want Warlocks... (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/491440375735648256))<br />
...to actually cast their DoTs most of the time. SB:SS should be a niche tool, not the main source of DoT applications. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/491440468631121921))<br />

all questions about stance dancing have been ignored, myself and others have asked many times.<br />
Not ignored, just already answered in the patch notes. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/491413153608003585))<br />
We expect that in their current implementation on beta, it'll displease many warriors, but won't once... (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/491413458001227777))<br />
...we fully implement it. Some changes are good, even knowing that we won't get much positive feedback. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/491413778559270913))<br />
<br />
3 Raging Blows = 12 second CS window, correct?<br />
If those RBs are within the CS, yes. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/491722836101189633))<br />
What about Enrage extention? Enrage already falls off before CS less reliable crit now, just going to BT more in CS<br />
Yes, as you absolutely should. It significantly changes your in-CS gameplay. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/491723911281655808))<br />
Yes will have to play with it more. Just seems like we will spend all the extra CS hitting BT again for Enrage.<br />
1 extra BT within the CS is not &quot;all the extra CS&quot;. Big difference. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/491725029831241729))<br />
<br />
Think we could shift some of the rage gen away from crit? This helps a lot but even having crit be +50% instead of +100%...<br />
That's also on our list in case we need to tune up or down the value of crit, but will happen in tuning. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/491725701569990656))<br />
<br />
Warlords of Draenor Stats<br />
however dots do multistrike yes?<br />
The *damage* from DoTs will multistrike. The DoT itself doesn't apply two debuffs. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/491633556527915010))<br />
<br />
I think it gets confusing on the few abilities that have multiple hits. Penance, Missiles, etc. AoE/Dots trigger per tick?<br />
Each Penance missile, or each Arcane Missile, can multistrike. AoEs can deal multistrike damage to each target individually. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/491633800623837184))<br />
<br />
I ultimately don't understand how in the end it is any different than a crit. It's just a chance of increased damage.<br />
Similar in that it gives you additional damage, but it does so in a different way, with a different feeling, and implication (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/491633965501931520))<br />
<br />
can the damage resulting from multistrike crit?<br />
Yes, but a multistrike's damage is not dependant on the damage that triggered it; it's a separate damage roll. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/491635583165280257))<br />
<br />
This brings the question: Will resource generators multistriking generate more resources or will it just copy the damage?<br />
Just the damage. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/491634606584889345))<br />
<br />
General answer to all &quot;Does this Multistrike?&quot; questions:Everything benefits *once* from Multistrike. No doubledipping, or zerodipping. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/491631565311442945))<br />
Does that include taunts? :P<br />
.No, debuffs/buffs don't multistrike, only damage/healing. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/491632814266130432))<br />
how do HoTs and Dots benefit from multistrike? Extra tick or doubled damage/healing?<br />
Each tick has a chance to multistrike. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/491633392186712064))<br />

<br />
random question but are the arakkoa outcasts the wingless ones or do they have some winged outcasts too?<br />
The vast majority are cursed and have withered/useless wings. You might meet a few un-cursed arakkoa who have left Skyreach... (_DonAdams (https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/491705734413840384))<br />

There is no reason not to go to shared tagging, all you do with the current system is create trolling and ire as people try to complete quests. I rather walk up and take out this mob with this one guy instead of letting him kill it and having to wait for it to respawn to fight whoever else is there for claim.</div></div><hr />

All open world tagging would encourage is for me as a Mage to walk through the quest area, Ice Lance any mob already engaged in combat with someone else, then reap the rewards for zero effort.<br />
<br />
Open world tagging would be ok if there is a minimum damage requirement, such as a % of mob health based on the number of tags.</div></div><hr />

I've never seen this type of activity in other mmos with shared tagging it's generally not that worth it. Most players would get pretty bored of playing like this. In any case you'd still have to run around and loot everything. Aoe loot doesn't have that large an area.<br />
Most share tagging does have a min participation to get the rewards anyway. <br />

You get loot and quest completion proportional to the amount of damage your group did to the mob (every quest where you kill multiple things gives you a percentage completion rate, with harder NPCs granting more).

I actually really disliked this system, in Wildstar I was trying to complete quests as fast as possible and when spawns were slightly limited I found it REALLY annoying several other guys would just jump in and &quot;steal&quot; 50% of my credit. I'd rather just have the option to help people kill a mob out of kindness than out of gaining any benefit.</div></div><hr />

Wildstar's system doesn't fit WoW either. Aion had a similar one, except there only the person doing the most damage would get credit. Certain classes were that way put at heavy disadvantage over others, which is probably what would happen in WoW as well. I haven't played in a while, but last I checked some classes would burst down mobs a lot quicker than others. Burst would be very important in areas with a lot of players.<br />

<br />
Honestly, I would not even be comfortable with stealing credit from the one who attacked the mob first. How is that any less &quot;griefing&quot; than the current system? (which imo hasn't been a problem in years... or well, only at expansion launch).<br />

<br />
If I'm waiting for respawns, I tend to help kill the one active mob even if it's not my tag. Makes the mob die quicker, gives me something to do while waiting, and any new mob will respawn quicker(not by much, but atleast I didn't just sit there and watch when I had the chance to actually do something more fun some of that extra time).</div></div><hr />

Nobody plays WoW for leveling, it's time for them to stop pretending. Make leveleing simple and painless experience where people don't need to fight over mobs - it works wonders in other MMOs and promotes cooperation instead of pointless competition.</div></div><hr />

Nobody, eh? I know enough people who actually like levelling alts. I don't, I'm crap at levelling but it is certainly NOT the fact that we don't have open tagging that puts me off. Mainly, because it almost never happens, the world is so vast and varied, you barely see anyone else, 1-85. Even in MoP you barely see anyone levellling. <br />
<br />
I mean mob competition is only going to be an issue at the launch of WoD, after that, it'll die down after the initial surge, furthermore, should there /be/ any cooperation between horde and alliance? They should most certainly be competing with each other. The best way around mob competition in the initial surge is just form a group with guildies or friends.</div></div><hr />

<br />
in every MMO I've played with shared tagging, I've had a massively better experience than in games with mob tagging.<br />
<br />
Rift had tagging, removed it, massive increase in fun right there. I like seeing other players. Or GW2 where everything is shared, its great, players help each other, players ressurrect each other. Its really social around events with people forming crowds and chatting.<br />
<br />
When in the world, you see other players, you play with them, you talk if you want.<br />
<br />
<br />
Compare that to wow.....annoyance everytime I see another player in the same area. Competing for resources and mobs and quest items. Pick up groups are not social at all, no more so than shared tags anyway....<br />
<br />
LFG dailies.....<br />
<br />
Then never say anything until you drop group.<br />
<br />
Bliz really needs to get out of the past.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bas Prime</div><div class="date">2014-07-29, 11:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">In all the time since I played GW2, I wondered why Blizz would not use this great system of having mobs being tabable by everybody. <br />
I kinda get their arguement, but in all the many years I played WoW, I was always annoyed at my faction for tabing a mob I was just approaching. (If an Alliance member would tab it, fine, we are at war).<br />
I tried to group in my early years. Mostly I got &quot;already in a group&quot; and there would be no invite for me, or just a decline. Nowadays I dont want to group. I want to help, yes, but I want to do that on the fly, not having to invite, or be invited. Make buffs like auras, so every faction member benefits from it without being in a group, and without me having to constantly (every hour, of course) rebuff my stuff. (where is that skill or useful, or even not annyoing?)<br />
<br />
My example from GW. There is a herb I want to gather (Herbs, veins and stuff is phased in GW2 so everybody can farm it) and a mob is &quot;guarding&quot; it. So I attack the mob to kill it. In WoW, another player rushes to the herb and collects it, and is gone, while I still fight with the mob. In GW, there is a good, (in my expirience) chance, the player will help me kill the mob (since he can also loot it then) and we can both collect the herb. <br />
In what universe is that a bad thing? (No, not in all of them!)<br />
<br />
Also, while we are at it, insert the Gold, Silver and Bronze level of reward. Do it in LFR for Dommhammers sake. So if players are just barely approaching the mob, or the boss, and they make the last 5% of the HP of the boss damage to it, then it will probably only be a bronze reward, while players who where there all the time, not afking, and damaging, tanking and healing like they should get gold reward. <br />
So there would be no afking in LFR, and the people who do minumum ammount of efford get the minimum or nothing.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Azrile</div><div class="date">2014-07-29, 11:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the argument Blizzard is using about shared tagging is a theoretical one that has not played out in other games with shared tagging. Their argument sounds good on paper, but the reality is in games with shared tagging, you just do not see the behavior that Blizzard seems to expect will happen.<br />
<br />
But that said, WOW is unique in many ways. The community, especially those wishing to ´cheat´ are much more efficient and advanced in WOW. I could see tag-sharing be used as part of gold-farming.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Noix</div><div class="date">2014-07-29, 12:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">good idea should be base on the dmg done to mob.. more times you hit it more exp you gain (IE: low % such as .0100% to your exp with the kill of X % *we say 1%). so that way people wouldnt just run around hitting a mob and moving on, and would also have people help out others on that mob.<br />
<br />
Not sure if that make sense let me break it down.<br />
<br />
Mob A gets hit by Player A &amp; B<br />
both get total of kill xp (we say 1% keep it small)<br />
but Player A attacked it more so gets that bonus from attacking it per hit (each hit = .0100%)<br />
player B came half way but still get that bonus from attacking it per hit (each hit = .0100%)<br />
Player A got (we say) .9% total from all his hits<br />
Player B got (we say) .5% total from all his hits (due to coming half way into the fight)<br />
Both players get (we say) 1% for killing the mob as a team.. <br />
Player A = 1.9% Xp from that mob<br />
Player B = 1.5% Xp from that mob<br />
<br />
That way it sorta forces that other player to stay and help cuz your getting xp from each hit.<br />
Idea is from RF Online (if anyone played the game) each hit gives you % of xp (this includes the dmg you do to mob) + the kill % xp from that mob.</div></div><hr />

I just don't buy any of the mob tagging arguments, it's just bad for interaction. :) All it does is make it easier for groups that has already formed, instead of encouraging groups to form. I'm not even lying if I said it is the primary way I've made friends in this same other mmo, because I didn't know hardly anybody joining it.<br />
<br />
All you've got to do is to make sure there is a certain treshold for mobs, like you have to be present for 20% of its life (the value scaling with amount of players) or something, to get credit. This way you can't just tag and pass. The reward you get is really no big deal if you add something like this, no reason to scale it down. It is a nonissue then because you simply cannot tag that many things that are spread out, if you also have to damage them.<br />
<br />
I also saw a great post in that thread regarding how people that are a bit cautious in forming ties with strangers is actively discouraged by the system in WoW where if you don't naturally end up grouping, why on earth would you feel an incentive to actually group, on a social level? I'm pretty introverted, as is a very large part of humanity, so it's not an isolated thing. I can relate to this a lot, it's exactly how I feel on the topic. For me, free tagging made a huge difference in actually forming those ties.</div></div><hr />

Some bad spawnrate questmobs or events have dozens of people jumping every spawn or just camping a spawn for half an hour to get their tags.<br />
<br />
At lvl 96 I have about 7 unfinished quests simply because after half an hour I gave up on the spawn. I reported them all through the ingame suggestion system and I expect them all to be fixed with release, but for now it does get annoying.<br />
<br />
There are also several areas where the spawnrate scales with number of people and I haven't heard any complaints about those. I'm curious why Bliz doesn't add that mechanic to simply every spawn. It will give a much better respawn rate feel right off the bat.</div></div><hr />

GW2 trains through Arah farm excessively based on the very fact that shared tagging is enabled. You just get a blob of 50 max levelled players spamming AoE just to ensure they each get credit before mobs die. Would not want to see that become a meaningful practice in WoW.</div></div><hr />

A lot of newer MMOs use faction tag and it's incredibly convenient to the point where it inspires players to help each other out regardless of being grouped or solo rather than see the name turn grey a fraction of a second before you hit it, you groan, and move on to another mob. Spawn rates are a non-issue in games which use this method.<br />
<br />
Just feels like another system Blizzard is reluctant to change and I don't feel it's for the better.<br />

<br />
If you mean the three defense missions that were within a minute or so run between each other, yeah, I would put more of that blame on to the developers for not realizing the consequences of putting timed events (often in series) which can provide you with massive amounts of points, items to salvage and crafting materials that ran 24/7 to the point where you could literally no longer see the mobs due to the amount of players on screen at once.<br />
<br />
For an open/faction tag system to work, the rest of GW2 and Wildstar are good examples of how they handle it through mob density and respawn rate.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As opposed to now where players out in the world in WoW actively avoid each other because there's no reason at all to help? What you're describing in GW2 isn't because of open tagging, it's because the game sort of funnels players into that type of behavior just because it's available and the density of normal and group mobs is far higher than it is in WoW. You're also ignoring the fact that in every other place in GW2, open tagging is a huge benefit. It encourages social behavior simply because there's literally no reason not to help out people who are around you. And let's be real: a lot of people are going to take the path of least resistance anyway, so if there's an equivalent to Champion farming in WoW, people are doing it already. Back when Timeless Isle was new, people were forming raid groups to farm rep all the time. How is being a nameless person in a 40 man raid any different than doing exactly the same thing without having to form that raid group?<br />
<br />
Speaking of Timeless Isle, it's weird because of how perfectly it illustrates the difference between shared and unshared tagging. All of the named mobs and rares are open and people naturally gravitate to one another to kill them. They may not talk to each other much or form actual groups, but they're still playing together because there's no effort required to do so. Then you have every other mob on the isle that isn't shared. What do you do when you see someone killing one of those? You go somewhere else. You may group up, but just as it is throughout all the other levels in the game as people are questing to level up, unless people form groups with people they already know, chances are they're playing solo.<br />
<br />
Open tagging removes the pressure to be social and simply lets it happen naturally. People help one another because there's no reason not to. I'd be willing to bet that most players here who have spent any amount of time solo questing have wished at least a few times that those other people killing the quest mobs weren't there. So with open tagging, even if you're not making friends every time you kill a mob together, at the very least that's better than actively avoiding contact at all, isn't it?</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;X game does it and its not antisocial...&quot; Okay, let's say you see x paladin in quest area, cool, you quest together. Once the quest is over, no words are exchanged, nothing social actually happens. It may seem like a small thing, but asking to group may result in chit chat while killing stuff and may result in friend listing, guild inviting. If this isn't happening, either you are a toxic person or they are, not the community as a whole. Open tag doesn't reward you for socializing. <br />
<br />
&quot;X game splits quest credit...&quot; Okay, cool so that lock dotting and running around the field gets the same credit you get without as much effort. You play a class without an instant cast spammable dot. These same locks would /roll their eyes and tell you to re-roll. Other players seem like a nuisance for efficiency.<br />
<br />
&quot;X game splits kill experience...&quot; So, by the time you run out of quests in one zone without reaching the level requirements of the next zone, you are stuck mindlessly grinding the few non-quest-related mobs away from other players. Seems like antisocial behavior. Other players seem like a nuisance for efficiency. &quot;but you can group up...&quot; Yeah, just like in wow... during quests.<br />
<br />
Bosses and named mobs are always open tap, and the rarer multiples-needed quest kills always have their spawn rates increased or get put on dynamic spawn timers based on other players in the area. &quot;Oh, but if too many people are in the area, killing one will have them spawn on top of me once I am done...&quot; &lt;---An actual genuine gripe? Whaaaaa... Okay, this just means you have to make note of where they spawn, and pull them into safe areas where you can escape afterwards. Open world should be dangerous anyways. Learn to group for fun, efficiency, and to prevent having to corpse run every 5 minutes.<br />
<br />
If you argue after this, you may just be stubborn. :) I love you anyways.</div></div><hr />

exactly...I have been in countless groups for rep/coin farm on the island and guess what, no one ever spoke or even better put someone on friend list...first they add all those LFG tools and LFR to let everyone push a button solo and do dungeons/raids without ever need to say a word and then they care about &quot;social&quot; activities and they try to achieve this social part with a very old and outdated mechanic..how ironic.</div></div><hr />

You just get a blob of 50 max levelled players spamming AoE just to ensure they each get credit before mobs die. Would not want to see that become a meaningful practice in WoW.<br />
<br />
and yet its massively more social to do that, have fun event farming in GW2, jking with people talking between events, helping people in the zones to do stuff. All the time people are in chat asking for a bit of help with a skill point or something and someone will go help.<br />
<br />
I just dont see it in wow, which I regards as a single player game unless you are LFG running or in a raid.</div></div><hr />

This is one thing that GW2 did so well, I felt excited to see other players because I wasn't competing with them for anything, not even resource nodes. WoW might be okay with shared tap on named mobs and dynamic spawns for the regular ones, but only if quests are intelligently designed (e.g. kill 20 mogu, not kill 10 mogu warriors and 10 mogu mages-- inevitably, one of these groups spawns less than the other and then it's trolling and stealing to finish up because no one wants to be wasting time clearing the surplus mobs).</div></div><hr />

<br />
1) allowing the ability to solo queue for dungeons/scenerios/lfr even when grouped - the system for this is already in place and its working for battlegrounds even when in a group you can solo queue or grp queue for battlerounds<br />
<br />
2) for quests that to loot X of Y from corpses you can have it shared so that all your party memebrs that killed Y mobs 4 of X drops all members that killed Y get the 4 of X this alredy qorks for the 50 ephoc stones quest from timeless isle, exaple me and houyi kill 8 frogs 5 stones drop houyi loots the 5 stones i can also go and pick up those stones</div></div><hr />

I really don't think any of the bosses looked challenging at all &gt;.&gt; <br />
<br />
that is how a run around in a circle mechanic looks like [can't post links]<br />
<br />
So you just run and avoid lava circles? That is boring. Can't even attack anything. You just run. It's just repetitive and annoying after first 2 times.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;X game does it and its not antisocial...&quot; Okay, let's say you see x paladin in quest area, cool, you quest together. Once the quest is over, no words are exchanged, nothing social actually happens. It may seem like a small thing, but asking to group may result in chit chat while killing stuff and may result in friend listing, guild inviting. If this isn't happening, either you are a toxic person or they are, not the community as a whole. Open tag doesn't reward you for socializing. <br />
<br />
&quot;X game splits quest credit...&quot; Okay, cool so that lock dotting and running around the field gets the same credit you get without as much effort. You play a class without an instant cast spammable dot. These same locks would /roll their eyes and tell you to re-roll. Other players seem like a nuisance for efficiency.<br />
<br />
&quot;X game splits kill experience...&quot; So, by the time you run out of quests in one zone without reaching the level requirements of the next zone, you are stuck mindlessly grinding the few non-quest-related mobs away from other players. Seems like antisocial behavior. Other players seem like a nuisance for efficiency. &quot;but you can group up...&quot; Yeah, just like in wow... during quests.<br />
<br />
Bosses and named mobs are always open tap, and the rarer multiples-needed quest kills always have their spawn rates increased or get put on dynamic spawn timers based on other players in the area. &quot;Oh, but if too many people are in the area, killing one will have them spawn on top of me once I am done...&quot; &lt;---An actual genuine gripe? Whaaaaa... Okay, this just means you have to make note of where they spawn, and pull them into safe areas where you can escape afterwards. Open world should be dangerous anyways. Learn to group for fun, efficiency, and to prevent having to corpse run every 5 minutes.<br />
<br />
If you argue after this, you may just be stubborn. :) I love you anyways.<br />
<br />
By &quot;split&quot; quest experience is not the same as shared experience. If you do 10% of the damage you get 10% of the quest credit. Your quest progress is only measured in percentages. The exception to this is bosses, which, yes if you hit the boss once you get credit and can complete the quest. In any case, there are more quests to do in a zone than needed to level up, so you generally shouldn't run out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm in a pretty casual guild, but still MoP was the first expansion where we didn't clear any heroic bosses. When the last raidleader quit the game the choice was no raids or someone that didn't want to start leading. That someone ended up being me and I did not feel up to leading heroic progression raiding. So we called raiding quits after we cleared everything on normal with all the regular raiders.<br />
<br />
We'll have to do some new recruiting in WoD because of the long period of inactivity, but I prefer it over a WoW burnout. The plan for WoD is to at least do some mythical bosses, but we're not to worried if we don't clear it :-)</div></div><hr />

*swoooosh* Over your head. However it's divided, it will be scrutinized by anyone who doesn't agree. Here's a possible result of percentage damage=percentage quest exp, percentage loot drops, and/or percentage quest credit... OP classes will have an exponentially easier time leveling, gearing up, and completing quest chains required for other perks, because they just hit harder and if hitting harder = more experience, more loot allowances, and faster quest completion (higher xp-per-hour). The OP classes will be nerfed into the ground. One perceived OP class/spec will rise and fall after another, and while OP classes usually get nerfed anyways, there will be more push to homogenize to make things &quot;fair.&quot; And you know damn well that once that happens, healers will complain that the already difficult level experience is too hard without others trying to &quot;help&quot; by siphoning off experience, because their specs struggles to kill things. No healers leveling up, no healers in leveling dungeon queues. Slippery slope, slippery slope.</div></div><hr />

Somewhat flavor. It's a very fair criticism that most DPS with mana bars don't use mana as their primary resource. (Celestalon)<br />
In these cases, Mana is functionally a tertiary resource, used for offheals/utility. Presentation as primary is misleading. (Celestalon)<br />
<br />
Blizzard just officially killed mana. RIP mana 2014.</div></div><hr />
