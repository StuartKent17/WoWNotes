Oh, come on, it was universally agreed to be the easiest way to get heroic badges, it makes perfect sense to bring it in line with the other heroics.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I guess its not too much of an buff considering I cant see anything about the +36 Dmg on the hemo-debuff in the complete patch notes... after all this would have been an approximate extra dmg of 200 witch each hemo... this 25% more dmg with hemo is actually less! Still its a good change and I'd appreciate either way of buffing my spec xD</div></div><hr />

I can't believe they're changing it to that, though. It looks really... stupid. I don't use volley practically ever, but whenever I do... I'm going to feel like a clogged sprinkler. <br />

I do hope they nerf the volume of the robotic clanking sound the robot makes as it roams around. I also hope our raid doesn't miss too many ZA timers due to watching all 10 of our robots (once I make some for everyone else) go after each other.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Look at the timestamps at the left side. The moment I gained mana/health from the potions I gained an additional buff in some cases:<br />
<br />
1st potion: no buff<br />
2nd potion: Major Agility<br />
then canceled the Major Agility buff (and a Major Fortitude buff I already had beforehand)<br />
3rd potion: Fel Strength<br />
4th potion: Major Armor (same as Major Defense Elixir)<br />
5-8: no buffs<br />
canceled Fel Strengh and Major Armor buffs and drank a flask<br />
9-12: no buffs<br />
<br />
It looks as if the procc rate is quite low, but in fact it is very high. I made further tests and canceled any elixir buffs every time before drinking potions and always gained an elixir buff. Potions 5-12 didn't give any buffs because I already had battle/guardian/flask buffs active.</div></div><hr />
