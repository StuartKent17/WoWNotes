<br />
Actually not more than any other (gated content + AP farm + running makes it seems like there is a lot), since new WQ aren't exactly content and most of the expansion is based on that Diablo 3 daily system. Even the legionfall campaign is filled with &quot;filler quests&quot;... 100 demons... 100 marks... 100 demons... 12 WQs...<br />
<br />
Even while leveling (where the bulk of the content for a xpac would be), a good chunk of the quests were just fillers.</div></div><hr />

You know, it's always been this way with end game content right? Even back in TBC we couldn't fly on the Isle. Although while I'd be fine if flying was legit removed, this isn't that.</div></div><hr />

Very likely. 7.3 will be on live servers somewhere at the end of August/early September. Raid open in November.<br />

Argus the unmaker is 99% certain to be Sargeras. We're not gonna fight all these titans, and not face the crown jewel, that would be dumb.</div></div><hr />

Im sorry, is the page your property?i think you're missing the point which is you look like an idiot when you bitch about a game that you seemingly hate on a forum entirely based off of said game.<br />
<br />
I don't think we're fighting Sargeras, I think the Argus boss is literally the titan soul of Argus. It's possible that Sargeras possesses it though.<br />
<br />
Also interesting to see that new dungeon has a bunch of Void stuff, especially considering how the point of the entire Burning Crusade is all anti-void.</div></div><hr />

There are 3 zones in Argus and we've seen only one. The rest wil be unlocked as we progress in the planet.<br />
<br />
I believe Mac'aree (one of the 3 zones) will be like what you want to see of an Eredar city.</div></div><hr />

MMO Champion's file is named Aggramar.jpg, which seems really odd but the helmet does match. Yes, Aggramar was a titan and this would therefore be the first in-game titan not counting the planet Azeroth. However...all titans except Sargeras and Azeroth are supposed to be completely dead. The picture certainly doesn't look like he's doing too well, but I wonder why or how he is actually alive.</div></div><hr />

Yeah there are some wicked looking models there for sure and even the comments on that page they have no idea who, what, where, when, how and why we have the Pantheon showing up well some of the Pantheon..

How it's possible is an entirely different question which will be explained in the patch/raid.<br />

Thanks for the nightmares Blizz. I don't know where that many faced-draenei-dogmonster has crawled out from, or why you all thought it would be just lovely to use as a mount but I both love and hate it. Which I am sure was the intention. <br />
<br />
Loving we get more dogs finally, can we get a spaniel sometime? Love spaniels. And that, what, manaray mount? looks sweeeet please just let it be reasonable to obtain ._. in fact, just please let all these new mounts be reasonable and not 'hey you got exalted with - new rep - get exalted over and over until you maybe get this sweet new mount'.</div></div><hr />

1 why dont you go play FF. (im glad graphics are all bc FF sucks as a MMO)<br />
and 2 for a esthethic point of view the Argus zone (we saw so far) look on point to a Legion conquest world.<br />
3. Stop speaking bullshit bc they upgrade the engien again for Legion. <br />

What you want is a redo and they wont do that. Right now WoW for a 11 year game look really nice. Better that some new mmo that come out this year.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This will be on the PTR quite a while, ToS needs way more time to breathe than August. <br />
<br />
If this is the last big content patch for Legion, then September/October, and possible new expansion reveal at Blizzcon. If there's more content (raids) coming after this, then they'll debut the trailer for 6.3 at Blizzcon, and it will open then.<br />
<br />

<br />
Anyone else having trouble updating the PTR? I keep getting an error everytime I click Update.<br />
<br />
The first day/week of the PTR is going to be like that, it always is. They often work on under-the-hood stuff, which will break the server. It just got released - try again tomorrow, or the day after. We're headed into a holiday weekend in the US, so the PTR will be slammed.</div></div><hr />

and 2 for a esthethic point of view the Argus zone (we saw so far) look on point to a Legion conquest world.<br />
3. Stop speaking bullshit bc they upgrade the engien again for Legion. <br />
<br />
What you want is a redo and they wont do that. Right now WoW for a 11 year game look really nice. Better that some new mmo that come out this year.<br />
<br />
Alright, point out the change in Legion.<br />
<br />
No, I don't want a redo. I specifically said, volumetric light/fog which is a post-processing shader that works in any engine. Overwatch already uses some form of it and it looks fantastic.<br />
<br />
And I already play FF, I have the moneh. :P</div></div><hr />

cool that overwatch use it, isnt the same engien of WoW<br />
<br />
WoW preatty much use the same engien that Warcraft 3 use. That why they have alot of limitation. <br />
<br />
Again if you want a nice looking game go play FF, that game look nice but is boring as fuck.<br />

- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
conntent? blizzard doesnt release much content - look at 7.2.5: all you got where class mounts and thats it.<br />
(no the raid doesnt count cause thats 7.2 and you KNOW IT)<br />
<br />
7.2.5 added deat of chromie<br />
btw since when has any 0.0.X patch added a raid other then ruby sanctum, your acting liek &quot;god every o.o.x patch adds a raid, this is nothing special&quot; we gotta compare all of 7.2 and 7.2.5 to other simple O.X patches</div></div><hr />

<br />
These models are used for the bosses in the raid. I wonder how they'll fit in the story, as they were supposed to be dead millenia ago</div></div><hr />

<br />
There's no &quot;sense of adventure&quot; when you're leveling up your 3rd or 4th alt. Flying makes leveling alts much easier and less tiresome.</div></div><hr />

<br />
b....but deathwing did do a barrel roll... like a fuck ton of times... Arthas was cocky as all hell and wanted tirion to see what he would do</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you want to really bet on this, you should bet for 7.2 just before Blizzcon and 7.2.5 in December</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">risingforce</div><div class="date">2017-07-04, 06:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">In the first zone in the PTR there are many and varied shades of brown and orange with some red and green thrown in.. :)<br />
<br />
On other things I had to chuckle at those whinging about having no flying, quite funny really.. :)<br />
<br />
Likewise, love the Pathfinder &gt; Flying experience. Have never met anyone in game that actually dislikes the premise. I think, back in WoD -when it was a new concept -yeah, it was met with trepidation but that soon turned to wonder and &quot;oh actually this is cool&quot;.<br />
<br />
PS on the limited palette of Argus, I guess we will see more variety via the Rifts via seeing other planets, a concept I always wanted explored in WoW so I'm pretty psyched about that and how Blizz have explained our time on Argus. Good times!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm not looking forward to crawl on the ground at 110% speed again. I don't even -require- flying. Just a ground mount that goes at least to 200%.<br />
<br />
There will be some teleport beacons.</div></div><hr />
