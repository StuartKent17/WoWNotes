We tried a couple of nerfs to Sudden Death, such as less damage or less chance to proc. We didn't like any of them, so for now the ability is staying as is. <br />

Currently on the PTR, it is based on chance per hit, and not crit. And is indeed a 9% fully talented. I realize this was said differently, but I imagine this change will go live on Tuesday, we have seen many things stay the same even though we were told otherwise. I know its in direct contridiction to what was said, but I am not sure what will happen, I imagine this will be a HUGE nerf to arms warriors as is.<br />
<br />
I think the person who has said why no warrior nerfs, doesn't realize what they are saying and now has been put straight, arms will drop the 4k at 70 will be like 1500. The 4k was based off of bugged Rends, and most of those are fixed now. (Rends as in deep wounds, rend will go back to crap, and deep wounds, maybe would be okay at 80, nothing more.)<br />
<br />
I am excited for the fix to Titan's Grip, and hopefully the changes to resilence will fix the broken resilance. I finally found a decent build, for raiding, although kinda blows soloing as it doesn't taken improved Commanding Pressence.<br />
<br />
Also of note, the talents on mmo-champion look nice as always.</div></div><hr />

What Ghostcrawler meant is that it's staying as it is on BETA, the reply was made to a question on the BETA forums. Therefore Sudden Death is getting changed on Live but it's staying the way it is on the latest BETA build (Chance on Hit).<br />

yep. And eventually after WotLK comes out and we all get our butts up to level 80, there was another post talking about looking at it even further and capping the rage used for a SD execute too since it's still pretty dang powerful. But that's a ways off obviously.</div></div><hr />

This is actually just a change on the wording of the talent. Base vampiric embrace heals 15%; If increased by 66% of that value it becomes 25%, as it already is.</div></div><hr />

Improved Icy Talons now increases the melee and ranged attack speed of your group or raid by 20% for the next 20 sec. (Old - Didn't affect ranged attacks)<br />
Improved Icy Talons now increase the melee haste of your group or raid and increases your haste by 5% at all time. (Doesn't affect ranged attack speed anymore, doesn't affect only the DK's melee haste anymore)<br />
<br />
<br />
Just to make sure I am reading and understanding this correctly.<br />
<br />
Is this saying that the Talent &quot;Improved Icy Talons&quot; will increase the melee and ranged attack speed of our group/raid by 20% for the next 20 sec AND increase the melee haste of our group/raid AND our own haste by 5% at all times?</div></div><hr />

It's better than nothing. I mean healing every DPS in the raid for such a little amount of mana and only having to cast it once every 10ish seconds? Even if it is a small amount, it's worth the time and mana spent. The range increase for Enlightened Judgements helps it too, as you don't have to move any closer to the mob / MT to cast it than if you were healing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If my math is correct, then this seriously screws over spell crits with a 50% damage crit bonus (as opposed to 100% crit bonus, as per physical strikes).<br />
<br />
Let's take a warlock's shadowbolt, without the talent ruin.<br />
<br />
For simplicity's sake, it hits for 1,000 and crits for 1,500.<br />
<br />
After a 33% reduction, that 1,500 crit is now hitting for 67% of its damage, or 1,005 damage.<br />
<br />
Yeouch... crits doing an extra 0.5 percent damage over regular hits (assuming you can even get a crit off agains the person in resilience gear)... joy.</div></div><hr />

Yeah yeah ;) my fishing gear now includes that epic 2m medallion ;) before I always risked it.. you seem majorly hung up on the fact I don't keep my pvp trinket equipped 24/7 =)<br />

but don't forget a Rogue doesn't kill you in a single stun - unless you fail at gear - he chains them together. Paladins just mess you up with a two hander while your stun counts down.

<br />
That is not how crit damage talents/reduction are calculated.<br />
Your hit is 1000, crit 1500. That means 500 crit damage. the 33% less crit damage from resilience is calculated over the 500 extra dmg you do from a crit. So normal hit 1000, crit after resilience 1375.</div></div><hr />

<br />
but don't forget a Rogue doesn't kill you in a single stun - unless you fail at gear - he chains them together. Paladins just mess you up with a two hander while your stun counts down. I've got no problem with the fact that I got jumped without my PvP trinket equipped, and therefore died, but I do have a problem when the tanking/healing/dps class can &quot;stunlock&quot; 8D<br />
<br />
I guess I should have rolled the flavour of the month like everyone else.. I've always wanted rogues to wear plate, but I didn't think they'd implement it this way ;) <br />
<br />
1. You had a fishing rod, so none of your abilities would've worked in either case delaying any answer you could've had against any class.<br />
2. Only Paladins, Rogues, and Mages, as far as my knowledge go, can get out of stuns in birthday gear.<br />
3. You didn't even try to get out of the stun. You didn't even try to fight back.<br />
<br />
4. Rogues have been able to do what that Paladin did since before Burning Crusade.<br />
<br />
You were a targeting dummy and you complain that you lost?<br />
And please, for the love of all that is holy, leave your PvE thinking at the door when you enter PvP.<br />
You play your spec to full capacity - all tools - and don't pretend that Rogues or Mages have other tools than just damaging moves<br />
Understand?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was very sure i read a post from GC about a week ago saying that these changes to Martyr and Blood would not be going to live as they were performing subpar on beta. Anyone else remember that? <br />
<br />
I'll try and find the post.<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT: Here it is...<br />
<br />
<br />
We are going to hotfix the nerfs to Judgement of the Wise (from 33% to 15%) and Seal and Judgement of Command (down 20% damage) to live. We need to start getting more testing on these changes right away to see what they do to Retribution in PvE and PvP. We still intend to lower the damage of other Seals and Judgements (except one - see below), but to hotfix those requires touching a lot more data so we think that change can wait for the 3.0.3 patch on live.<br />
<br />
We are also hotfixing the beta to return Seal and Judgement of Blood and the Martyr back up to 95% of where the used to be. Live will just never get the nerf to these abilities at all. Hopefully this will compensate PvE Retadins for relying less on more expensive AE abilities that risk putting them out of mana.<br />
<br />
To summarize:<br />
<br />
Live (3.0.2 build) -- Judgement of Wise change, Seal and Judgement of Command change.<br />
Beta (3.0.3 build) -- All nerfs already active, but Blood and Martyr un-nerfed.<br />
Next Live patch (to 3.0.3 build) -- Catches Live up to Beta. I can't give you an estimate for 3.0.3 on Live yet, but it will be before Lich King goes live on Nov 13. <br />
<br />
[...]<br />
<br />
As I posted in one thread, you should be able to use those core abilities (Divine Storm, a Judgement / Seal and Crusader Strike) without going OOM. Some players are finding that to be true, so please let us know if you aren't.<br />
<br />
If you do add Consecration or healing, your mana should drop down lower. You're making a choice not to be sustainable in order to do something else.<br />
<br />
Divine Plea should help offset that at 80. Some of the Int on your gear should help offset that for now.</div></div><hr />

Actually, it just says gathering professions, which are professions like herbalism, mining, and skinning. Makes sense to remove the level caps, because they are covered by the zones in which the nodes are located. A level 1 herbalist would have a very rough time collecting netherbloom.<br />
<br />
The non-gathering professions such as tailoring, blacksmithing, engineering, enchanting, inscription, etc. are not covered by this. If they removed the cap for those, you could powerlevel to the max just by hanging out in a capital city at the AH, even as a lowbie.</div></div><hr />

Yes, let me correct myself... It's the gathering professions, like skinning, mining, herbalism that you can immediately get @ Lv 1... You'll still have to follow the normal leveling guidelines as far as that profession is concerned...</div></div><hr />

&lt;li&gt;The epic ground mount is now available on the trainer at level 61, requiring 150 riding skill, and the non-epic mount learned.&lt;/li&gt;<br />

So they screwed this up. They set the riding requirement at expert.. So you can learn the mount at 61, but the prerequisite is lvl 70. :P</div></div><hr />

Your ignorance, stupidity and trolling is duly noted. If you don't know why they made this change, then you really never played a paladin in the new buffing system. Your not even wanting to go read what the change was about, shows you have no interest in your class whatsoever, and leads me to believe. Your a troll who just wanted to poke fun of something blizzard should have caught earlier but didn't. This sorta response is typical. Even when I first read the change, I knew exactly what it meant, and was happy for our paladins with their 30 min buff, being overwritten by a 2-4 minute buff.

QQ moah, the game isn't balanced around 70. 10g that when you are 80 with 22k hp and that Paladin finds you fishing and &quot;bursts&quot; you for 11k damage while stunned and then you turn around and rip his face off you won't ask for Paladins to be fixed from their horrible state.<br />

<br />
<br />
I'm saying the damage won't scale. If a paladin can burst down your 10k hp now, they will not be able to burst down your 22k hp. Their burst will barely affected by gear as compared to most other classes who will be receiving 10 more talent points worth of damage and also be getting new ranks and abilities.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Depending on what they acctually end up doing, but as it stands now, few things to note. The 500 base armor on the Earthwarde will most likely stay the same. The bonus 400%, or whatever it is now, will not be, so your not going to get 2k out of the staff. Does this make the Earthwarden that great, probably not. The bonus armor you get will be shifted to more on the leather pieces, IE your tier will still be your best upgrades.<br />
<br />
As I understand from my tanking feral friend, what he does now anyways, is gets the DPS staff to tank with since he was close to the armor cap, not sure for long though and his dodge and health are awesome.</div></div><hr />

sure this is a nerf to holy paladins cause Flash of Light is the main heal used by paladins at this point... but it's also a nerf to ret paladins that are not PvP specc'd usind the book to boost their instant FoL. <br />
<br />
I have done away with Seal of Command because of the recent nerf and because of the upcoming expansion. I, as I'm sure most of you, have noticed that melee gear itemization leans more toward Haste rating than anything else in WotLK. Thus I have already geared my Ret paladin in full Haste gear totaling over 420 haste full-time. Doing this drops the 3.5 of the Blade of the Harbringers down below 2.0 let alone the 240 haste from the meta trinket, and, if other ret pallies havent noticed, the scarab from Black Morass procs 505 haste on heals. i.e. instant Flash of Light.<br />
<br />
so 420<br />
+240<br />
+505<br />
=1165 haste rating (on rare occasion, but still)<br />
<br />
All of this speal is to show that the Libram is.. or WAS of great use to me and other haste pallies because if haste is low enough seal of the Martyr will far out dps seal of Command. and especially now with the nerf. <br />
<br />
So getting the 20 badge SoC libram is literally useless.<br />
<br />
And now that the Libram of Souls Redeemed is useless, what should a paladin like myself use in it's place?</div></div><hr />

There will be a compensation to the feral armor multiplier to adjust for this &quot;nerf&quot;. While I dislike the concept of homogenizing feral specific gear into the normal fold of widely usable equipment, I really don't think that it's that big of a deal.<br />
<br />
Oh, and if feral weapons disappear altogether, there'd be a buff to your DPS to compensate for that as well. (Just view your attack power stat as if you were a rogue and not a druid).</div></div><hr />

At this add an undocumented change in the rep panel, Ravenholdt went from the &quot;Other&quot; section to the &quot;Classic&quot; section, maybe they have plans to make the reputation farmable(more then the normal +1/+2) or dunno.</div></div><hr />

Now the dodge, parry, block skills will have a litlle DR, and the druid only have 1 defensive skill (dodge)<br />
<br />
The best thing that we can do that no have warriors, paladins or Deathknight is that we have a lot of armor and healht. <br />
<br />
We don't have a bonus of 5k armor from shields, we can't do parry, we can't do block....<br />
<br />
A good Epic Chest Leather armor have between 450-500 armor. ( in bear form 2000 - 2300 armor)<br />
A good Epic Chest Plate armor haver 1800-2000 armor<br />
<br />
If this nerf happen in WoTLK, i think that there is no druid in the game tanking...<br />
<br />
<br />
Unless they change the multiplier from ~4+ talented to ~7 talented and it only applies to leather armor... e.g. a ~500 chest is ~3500 in bear. That would completely compensate for the reduction to bonuses from rings/trinkets/necklaces/etc. leaving you with the same amount of armor. Thats what the post said they were going to do without specifying a multiplier change.<br />
<br />
Also note that the leather itemization in WotLK stacks insane amounts of agility... several hundred more in aggregate than any other tank will have. That means your dodge % will be higher than the combined dodge + parry of any other tank. And now that dodging an attack generates rage, the more dodges the better.<br />
<br />
The greater chance of the mob missing and the extra hit points bears carry compensates for the shield blocks they don't get.<br />
<br />
Bottomline, if they want the true avoidance numbers to be level among tanks in the same tier gear (blue posts have stated that they do), the mechanics to achieve that is very easy to implement, armor trinkets be damned.</div></div><hr />

aaand where exactly do you read that? It has already been stated somewhere that the quest lines remain, as an option to get the mounts/form at 60/70 already.<br />
<br />

<br />
The druid swift flight form was fun too without a feral set.<br />
<br />
First of all you can't really solo 2/3 of the solo bosses as balance, you can solo all three as feral though.<br />
<br />
Well the third one really sucked as a Feral though, even in the kara/blue healing gear I had back then.</div></div><hr />

Indeed. I could not solo the magic type boss as feral.</div></div><hr />

Consider the PVP implications of that change. Specifically the armor resto and feral druids will have in bear form.<br />
<br />
And you're completely wrong about bear dodge being higher than warrior/DK/Pally dodge+parry. In case you didn't know, they implemented DIMINISHING RETURNS for avoidance stats. Thus, ferals will scale extremely poorly in the avoidance department, compared to other tanks that have more places to spread their avoidance around in. (Defense, Parry, AND Dodge.)<br />
<br />
This change, and the Feral changes in general, FAIL.</div></div><hr />

How many times do the game designers have to state that they specifically want tanks at the *end* of that scale to be even with each other for you to 'get it'? If you dont think the dev process will include putting tanks of each class in full tier gear and testing them against raid bosses so that they can adjust the specs accordingly, then what do you expect? toss darts, spin a wheel, roll some dice? <br />
<br />
Nothing says the talent adjustments for the additional tanking armor (assuming it even ends up as a talent) have to remain within reach of restos/boomkins. <br />
<br />
DR on avoidance categories doesnt mean anything other than the devs have to factor it in when adjusting the numbers at the *end* of the scale -- like that's hard or something?<br />
<br />
Nice try, but your arguments are FAIL.</div></div><hr />

Uhm NO?<br />
I just tried it and it still does boost FoL, while not affecting HL at all. Test it and see.</div></div><hr />
