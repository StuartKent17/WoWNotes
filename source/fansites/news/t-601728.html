&quot;LOL ! You suck ! They removed them 2 months ago !&quot;. That's true. But they're back ! And it will let you get 5 . Always nice to have 5 free flasks for running &quot;old&quot; instances again.

Blizzcon<br />
Blizzard updated the Blizzcon site (http://www.blizzard.com/blizzcon07/) with tons of links about pretty much everything that happened here. (Yup, our changes list is here !)<br />
<br />
Meanwhile on PvPScene.com<br />
No uber articles today, but I posted a small compilations of PvP movies (http://www.pvpscene.com/index.php?topic=119.0). They're all pretty good and it will probably keep you busy one more hour this week end. <br />
<br />
Comics<br />
It's been a while, but they're back ! Some of them are a bit old, and I even repost the LFG musical short (but it's great !). Expect the usual updates to be back tomorrow.<br />

<br />
Those were put in so that guilds could &quot;attune&quot; people to TK and SSC without that person doing the attunement quests.<br />
<br />
But then Blizzard removed all attunements to TK and SSC, thus making that loot worthless.</div></div><hr />

Oh, right, that was a different item that you get after completing attunement.</div></div><hr />
