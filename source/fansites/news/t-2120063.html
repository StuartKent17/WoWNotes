Happy Thanksgiving, everyone. Let's talk a bit about legendaries.<br />
<br />
From the beginning of Legion, we've deliberately been pretty tight-lipped about how obtaining them works, because the best thing you can do to get them really does just boil down to &quot;play the game and do the max-level activities you enjoy most.&quot; It was meant to be a background universal reward that would occasionally offer a surge of power to complement the transparent and omnipresent Artifact and normal itemization systems. Obviously, as we sit here reading posts speculating whether it's better to delete unwanted legendaries to improve your chances of getting more, there's a lesson for us to learn from how that approach has played out. (PS: Don't delete your legendaries. The system looks at what you've gotten, not what you have.)<br />
<br />
We've also been pretty conservative in our design, with the intent of loosening the reins as time went on. With a system of this scale that spans all max-level activities, we couldn't be certain that we'd tuned it correctly based on data from thousands of people playing our beta for a few hours a week; it'd inevitably be different in the live game with millions of people playing in far more focused ways. And we knew that if we erred on the side of legendaries being too common, we could easily end up in a situation where some people (whether lucky people, or those who played the most) were flooded with them. If that happened, it'd have been a mess - a chunk of the playerbase would've had bags full of legendary items and no more to look forward to for months to come, and if we'd tried to &quot;fix&quot; it after the fact, then everyone who hadn't taken advantage of the generous period would have felt forever behind. <br />
<br />
So we started out stingy, since if we erred in that direction it would be far more fixable. (We've since increased legendary drop rates in general, in patch 7.1). We also put some measures in place to reduce the gap between the very luckiest player and the unluckiest player. Luck is inevitably a factor in games like this, but with millions of people playing the game, if we allowed pure randomness to go unchecked, there would inevitably be some players who played hours every week and literally never saw a single legendary item. Thus, the so-called &quot;bad luck protection&quot; that improves your chances a bit each time you could have gotten a legendary but failed to do so. <br />
<br />
As its name suggests, the &quot;bad luck protection&quot; system exists to protect the unluckiest players from the cruel fate of the dice. Those who were on the other end of the spectrum in terms of good fortune, we figured, didn't need a system to help put them even farther ahead of the rest of the world. And we drew that line at 4 legendaries, initially, planning to raise it as time went on. Once you'd gotten 4, you could absolutely get more, but the invisible hand of &quot;bad luck protection&quot; would no longer help you. Almost by definition, if you had 4 legendaries in, say, early October, you were super-lucky. You didn't need help getting more.<br />
<br />
What we genuinely did not anticipate was just how much some of the very most dedicated players would play, mainly in pursuit of Artifact Power. By mid-November, we started to hear questions about whether there was some sort of 4-legendary limit, and we realized that there existed a group of players that had done so much content that they actually had an expected legendary count of around 4. They hadn't needed to be unusually lucky to get there. (Note that this is a very small group. They're overrepresented in these discussions, because this issue concerns them, but we're talking about hundreds of people out of millions.)<br />
<br />
So we removed that soft cap just over a week ago. &quot;Bad luck protection&quot; now applies indefinitely. Most of the players in this category have probably been focusing on Mythic Trial of Valor for the past week, and since wiping repeatedly to raid bosses during progress sadly can't award legendaries, they haven't had a chance to see the effects of the change just yet. If/when some players get to a point when they have every legendary available for their spec, then so be it. They certainly will have earned it, and there will be more coming in future patches. The Unique-Equipped limit keeps the power gap between the haves and have-nots reasonable, and we'll continue to adjust the effectiveness of the outlier legendaries (coming up in patch 7.1.5) with the goal of keeping them exciting but not gamebreaking.</div></div><hr />

you may want to read it properly first, you could earn more than 4 before it was just unlikely due to bad luck protection not helping after you got the 4th.</div></div><hr />

the soft cap was in bad luck protection and not in how many legs you could obtain though. People were moaning you couldn't earn more than 4 but you could it was just unlikely without help.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Some people deny deny deny. The empirical evidence that it was almost impossible to surpass 4 legendary was substantial. I am glad Blizzard made this change, props to them for making the system better.<br />
<br />
Now the only step missing is to allow us to target specific legendaries in some way!</div></div><hr />

I even created a ticket and got a GM side stepping the question.

<br />
No, what I mean is what I mean. My post was directed towards those who claimed it was impossible to obtain a legendary if you already have 4, which there was no cap to. But there's really no need to discuss this, the information is all in the blue post.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In high end competitive where you and another one of your class have equal AP, but they have the BiS legends and you have shit, you get to not raid.<br />
<br />
If you spend your time grinding out M+s to try and get the BiS so you can get back on with raiding only to find out that too bad, soft cap, you would also be at least a bit annoyed.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Can we incorporate a legendary exchange system already? Give up on this system. Let people trade their unwanted ones in for a currency, and when they have 3 of that currency, be able to by the one they want. (now that BLP is on going, people will be getting more and more)<br />
<br />
DONT increase the total wearable from 2. With this terrible system eveyone is going to be in the same gear by the end of the xpac if this keeps increasing. Cut your losses, give people the 2 they want, and get on with the rest of the expansion so this can stop being a balance-tipper.</div></div><hr />

You get bad luck protection until 4 legendaries and when it's gone. This is the &quot;soft&quot; cap, beacause you could still get legendaries without bad luck protection but the chance is just super low.</div></div><hr />

This is highly cynical, but they could have made the change without anyone noticing it's out, and players would slowly start getting legendaries after the 4th one, invalidating previous claims of there being a cap, people would be happy without knowing what happened. You could say this is Blizzard being extra fair and honest to players - then why the hell now, after hiding almost EVERYTHING about legendary system until now? Why is the post even mentioning the unspecified rumors of a few people?<br />

<br />
Man, this is priceless... the few serious players saying that the legendary system is bad for this one game (not for Diablo 3 for example) and that this soft cap happened, against the entire blind/sheep community saying that the &quot;lolgendary&quot; system is fantastic and no such thing as soft cap existed...<br />
<br />
The sad thing is that this huge part of the community are the ones that drive most of the Blizzard decisions towards WoW nowadays... Garrisons, WQ, AP infinite grinding with poor rewarding system, Lolgendary chase... it only gets worse with the &quot;Diablofication&quot; of the game.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;we couldn't be certain that we'd tuned it correctly based on data from thousands of people playing our beta for a few hours a week&quot;<br />
<br />
That happens when you just want to use the beta to promote the game with streamers and youtubers, or people that just wanted to find exploits to use later, etc... people that could really test all that didn't get the beta access... (or they usually don't even care about the feedback, so we ended up with a live game full of bugs and crap class design), congratulations Blizzard.</div></div><hr />

It is clear by this post that they think bad luck has something to do with the number of legendaries you get, but that is simply not true. Every single player in the game that is just a little bit focused on performance/BiS/read anything about their class knows that it does not matter if you have a, say, 6 legendaries, but could not get the only 2 that would have actually helped your dps. That &quot;bad luck protection&quot; is only there to allow us to try and get a good legendary. Not a legendary. A good/BiS legendary. If you do not get one, you say &quot;F that&quot; and you are mad that you need to wait another 2-3 weeks before actually having the chance to, again, maybe get your BiS.<br />
<br />
If they could at least understand that nobody in the world cares about having a large number of legendary but instead only hopes to have the 1 or 2 good ones, Blizzard would not have put that damned softcap in the first place.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Waltzinblack</div><div class="date">2016-11-24, 05:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There were a lot of people in these forums making us feel bad for believing there was a soft cap. You should all feel bad and terribly stupid for being wrong.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MasterHamster</div><div class="date">2016-11-24, 06:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is one of those posts where you wish people had to fill out a small quiz before starting to write a comment after reading the headline.<br />
And then there's just a battleground of people who can't differentiate a soft cap from a hard cap. Maybe that's why there has, apparently, been some hefty discussions whether or not it was a cap in legendaries you could obtain, if terms were used incorrectly.<br />
<br />
There's an inherent risk if Blizzard becomes too transparent with how legendary drops etc work. The moment they'd put out base drop chance, people would within seconds start calculating the content that in theory has the highest &quot;legendary per day&quot; drop chance. Just look at Diablo 3 where you're essentially farming grossly overgeared difficulty levels because they calculated clearing speed versus legendary drops per hour. And the same would happen in WoW.<br />
<br />
But I can't really see what the controversy is? Has Blizzard ever claimed there was no cap? Is there some sort of reason why Blizzard has to disclose every detail of the legendary systems? Strange. Perhaps the silence was non-transparency with a good reason. So the community riled itself up as it always does over the problems of the 0.01% and Blizzard had to step in. Gee, haven't seen that a hundred times.<br />
<br />
<br />
What Blizzard really really need to understand is they do not share the same definition of &quot;bad luck&quot; as all the actual players. It is clear by this post that they think bad luck has something to do with the number of legendaries you get, but that is simply not true. Every single player in the game that is just a little bit focused on performance/BiS/read anything about their class knows that it does not matter if you have a, say, 6 legendaries, but could not get the only 2 that would have actually helped your dps.

<br />
This is exactly why they aren't disclosing all the details.<br />
And this is also sadly the biggest problem with this community. Everyone thinks everything should be optimal. <br />
&quot;Why can't I trade my legendary for &lt;best for spec&gt;?&quot;</div></div><hr />

They lied , they said nothing was preventing you from obtaining more.<br />
<br />
Now if base drop is 1 in 10000 for a legendary eligible action and each action increases it like for 0.00001% . You will see legendary because of bad luck protection, everything you do (legendary eligible content) is increasing the chance.<br />
<br />
They removed Bad luck protection after 4 , and denied there was good luck protection on multiple interviews, blue posts and others.<br />
So yes with legendary drop bug and now, twice they shot their own foot this expansion.<br />

Wtf man, even hazzikostas has called it softcap. It is a softcap if the base chance is very small and you need the bad luck protection buff to get a leg in a reasonable amount of time</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Motorman</div><div class="date">2016-11-24, 06:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That is precisely what a 4 legendary softcap is. If you didn't get bad luck protection after the 4th, you are getting worse odds than other players, i.e. a softcap.<br />
<br />
Well call it what you want there is no actual cap you are still free to be extremely lucky. A cap would be &quot;after 4 we REDUCE your chance&quot; (action taken). Instead, after 4 you go normal chance and everyone else has chance to catch up.<br />
<br />
I don't see a problem with that system and the wording &quot;soft cap&quot; implies some sort of unfairness and restriction. You still have your random normal luck though which means you can still hit 3 legends in a row or none.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dequanacus</div><div class="date">2016-11-24, 06:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">They lied , they said nothing was preventing you from obtaining more.<br />
<br />
Now if base drop is 1 in 10000 for a legendary eligible action and each action increases it like for 0.00001% . You will see legendary because of bad luck protection, everything you do (legendary eligible content) is increasing the chance.<br />
<br />
They removed Bad luck protection after 4 , and denied there was good luck protection on multiple interviews, blue posts and others.<br />
So yes with legendary drop bug and now, twice they shot their own foot this expansion.<br />
This legendary system was a mess from the begin.<br />
<br />
But they said nothing about good luck protection and regardless of the soft cap, you are still capable of obtaining more and several people have claimed to have more than 4 legendaries or know someone with more. To say &quot;nothing was preventing you from obtaining more&quot; is true. Nothing prevents you from obtaining more before and after this fix.<br />
<br />
Again, I don't really see what the issue is. They decided that four was enough to turn off the additional loot bonus. They never shut the legendary valve off completely. Whether people approve or disapprove, I don't see where Blizz was being sneaky.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When you play the lottery is there a soft cap? You have same chance as everyone to win. In game You just don't have the increased chance to win that others have. So others have a buff but you don't have a cap. And the buff to others is not unfair to you because you already have first 4 &quot;get them asap&quot; legendaries and you are now on normal terms chances to get or not get anything based on simple pure rng<br />
<br />

<br />
I'd like to hear your definition of a &quot;soft cap&quot;.<br />
<br />
The old system was:<br />
<br />
1st leg: base chance + cumulated chance from bad luck protection<br />
2nd leg: base chance + cumulated chance from bad luck protection<br />
3rd leg: base chance + cumulated chance from bad luck protection<br />
4th leg: base chance + cumulated chance from bad luck protection<br />
5th forwards: base chance<br />
<br />
If there weren't ANY cap, the chance for EACH leg would be the same. Is it the same? No, after 4 the chance is different.<br />
Is there a hard cap on getting legs? No, you can get more than 4. Unlikely, but possible.<br />
Therefore, there is a soft cap. Your chance on getting the first 4 while playing is higher than getting the next 4.<br />
<br />
To put it into one sentence:<br />
A hard cap on the bad luck protection resulted in a soft cap on the amount of legendaries that might drop within a timeframe.</div></div><hr />

It's amazing, the playerbase is incredibly observant of trends, and surprisingly accurate as of late particularly with regards to legendaries.

<br />
I'd say that trend was much easier to figure out than this. Going 500+ Mythic dungeons w/o a legendary if they're ~1/100+ dungeons isn't THAT crazy so we would need at least a 100 people or something huge to really be much more sure. That's an insane amount of time to put in. In the meantime, for the early legendary bug, we had many many people who got 2 right off the bat and almost no one with just 1. The odds of that being 'normal' were really low. Still though, this soft cap is yet another blow to this already super shit legendary system.</div></div><hr />

To put it into one sentence:<br />
A hard cap on the bad luck protection resulted in a soft cap on the amount of legendaries that might drop within a timeframe.<br />
<br />
The first 4 legendaries are &quot;get asap&quot;. So everyone gets them with bad luck protect etc. then the system becomes normal. Becoming normal is not a cap. Bad luck protect though is a buff.<br />
A cap is not being able to equip more than 2 at the time.<br />
<br />
So in my eyes no one gets penalized by this system. Up to 4 everyone has a boost. Past 4 everyone has his/her luck. I don't see why you call your own luck a restriction as &quot;soft cap&quot; implies.<br />
<br />
You wouldn't think caps existed if they hadn't buffed your chance to the first 4 legends. In fact if I got 4 and you only got 1 you would only blame your luck. Now they give you 4 and then pure randomness and you call pure randomness a cap.<br />
<br />
Blizzard can never ever win can they? For every new solution they make there is ALWAYS complaints by default. In the end they will just throw everything at vendors and be done with this but it will probably raise arguments about gold &quot;caps&quot; etc. /sigh</div></div><hr />

LUCK is not a cap. If you log in tonight and get 10 legendaries you won't write complaint posts. You are not restricted from getting 10 tonight. Your rng is intact. Not having a buff isn't a cap.<br />

Normal luck means you can still win the lottery any time any place but your chance is not buffed.<br />
<br />
That is exactly what a &quot;soft&quot; cap means. A hard cap would be direct code preventing someone from having more than 4. A soft cap would be some indirect barrier or plateau making it harder to obtain more than 4. Not having bad luck protection is a soft cap. That's why soft/hard is used for stats. A soft cap for haste would make getting more inefficient than what you got already. A hard cap would be an actual prevention of any further haste from changing what you have.</div></div><hr />

That is the definition of a softcap.<br />
<br />
A softcap doesn't mean &quot;you can't go beyond this point no matter what&quot;, it means &quot;past this point, further progress is harder/slower/less effective&quot;.<br />
<br />
For instance, specs which have their GCD reduced by haste have a softcap on haste-- once they reach a 1 second GCD, their GCD can't go any lower. Haste continues to have a benefit beyond that point-- it'll increase attack speeds, cast times, and reduce the cooldowns of certain abilities, but its value diminishes.<br />
<br />
This is distinct from a hardcap, which is when progress past a certain point simply isn't possible (or provides no further benefit). Crit, for instance, has a functional hardcap at 100%-- once you're critting on every attack, there is no benefit to getting more of it. Similarly, if they decided to make it so that you simply couldn't get higher than 20% crit, then the hardcap would be 20%.<br />
<br />
It's also possible for something to have both a softcap and a hardcap. Going back to the crit example above, let's say that they made it so that once you get more than 10% crit, each subsequent point of crit rating provides half of its normal value. You would then have a softcap at 10% and a hardcap at 20%.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This was a problem for a couple hundred of the biggest no lives in history who ran literally over a thousand mythic plus dungeons since 7.1 launched and no one else.<br />
<br />
People are frustrated because this directly contradicts how they told us that the system works-- they repeatedly stated the longer you went without finding a legendary*, the better your chances of getting one were. The fact that there's an exception to that rule is highly relevant.<br />
<br />
It also means that they put in a system that even more harshly punished people who had the misfortune to get offspec/bad legendaries, and didn't tell anyone about it.<br />
<br />
For some people, one of the things that they like most about games is being able to learn and understand a game's systems, then use to optimize their activity. This kind of secret mechanic specifically prevents them from doing it, and on top of that, they made statements about how the system worked that were misleading at best.<br />
<br />
*In terms of &quot;number of times that you could have potentially gotten one, but didn't&quot;. I know that it's not actually time based.<br />

The issue is that the base chance of getting a legendary is vanishingly low, and realistically, most people only find them after the bad luck protection has built up quite a bit. This was an extremely harsh softcap-- and worse yet, it was undocumented.</div></div><hr />

Having your BiS trinket drop again doesn't burn a bad luck protection mechanic that you've probably spent weeks building up. Yes, I know that bad luck protection (separately) applies to regular gear drops, but it builds up much more quickly, so you're losing probably a few days worth of progress, rather than potentially a month or more.</div></div><hr />

That's all I'm saying: all they tell you is past 4 it's down to your own luck. You can still win the lottery unrestricted. There is no cap. A cap = wear just 2 or roll just 10 times.

Yes, but undocumented or not, it didn't deny anything Blizzard had said prior to now. Blizzard thought four was sufficient and an argument clearly exists for that not being a good decision, I'm not arguing that. I don't understand what difference it makes that Blizzard chose to not divulge four being the magic number. They chose four regardless so either way, people would be doing what they are doing now.<br />
<br />
If you want to argue that removing the protection at four is bad, that's fine<br />
If you want to argue that Blizzard did something wrong by withholding that information, I don't really see it. They made that decision regardless of sharing it with the playerbase and they never lied about anything. People would be farming for a fifth, sixth, etc legendary regardless of whether they knew how hard it would be.</div></div><hr />

Exactly what I'm saying. I hit wotlk every week for invincible. I don't get it. Should I say I don't get it because of a soft cap at how many mounts I can have? <br />
<br />
The only fault was they got scared of random good luck so they falsely boosted everyone and this is the result now. Endless complaints &quot;why can't I have ten legends by now when I can only equip 2&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
You have a better chance of getting your legendary then you did getting the BIS trinket in previous expansions. If the trinket was on a raid boss you got one try a week and had to hope no one else rolled for the item. A private group getting 3 chests per run would have 15 chances daily to get a legendary not counting daily heroic, caches, and raid runs on 3 difficulties. If bad luck protection builds based on activity then players are building it far faster then in other expansions. So why are we not getting our legendary if the odds stack so fast? Because RNG doesn't care about sub numbers or player outrage.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But people have more than four legendaries. Again, I see this mostly being bitterness and not actually conclusive of any wrongdoing by Blizzard besides four being a stupid number to stop at. They didn't lie about anything and people would be grinding legendaries regardless of having the knowledge that the increased drop rate shuts off after four or not. It's all RNG in the end. Someone will always complain as they will never be guaranteed a legendary no matter how many people eventually get theirs.</div></div><hr />

Have legendary material that you turn in for a legendary. A lot of people know that feeling of getting a legendary only to find out that it is the useless neck Prydaz. Now you have to rely on &quot;bad luck protection&quot; to give you a legendary you actually want to use. Then OH! I got another legendary, but great I can't wear it because the stats are garbage(In case of rings and necks). For my Spriest, I wear an 845 neck with haste/crit because it is leaps and bounds better than Prydaz Mast/crit. <br />
<br />
You Know what they should do the Prydaz, make it like the trinket from withered j'im. On jewelry in general just have them give all 4 secondary stats with lower numbers. Like 500-700 of each stat + a 10% hp shield instead of the 30% hp shield they are reworking it to have.<br />
<br />
I still would rather have legendary material drop and when I have enough I can go to a vendor or craft it somehow. Like throw 10 legendary material in the Obliterum forge with an item and it crafts the one you want. Right now the Obliterum forge is nothing but a minor money making tool as crafted gear only goes to 855.</div></div><hr />

Almost no one ever claimed that. The thread someone started last week was talking about a soft cap, i.e. that your chances after 4 seemed to decrease dramatically compared to 0-4. Which is true. Virtually no one was saying it wasn't possible to get more than 4 because there are, in fact, some people with more than 4. <br />

They also said that the bad luck protection would increase so much that you would see legendaries dropping after a certain amount of time. Chances are your guild could have matched up on that average time where the bad luck protection got to the point where everyone started getting them.<br />
<br />
If your guild was getting 10 legendaries every day it would be a different thing. <br />

<br />
I made this account just to laugh at how you're arguing against everyone and everything when you're obviously wrong.<br />
<br />
Remember how stats used to work? <br />
Soft cap for haste:<br />
1000 haste had a ratio of 1 haste for 1 point.<br />
1001 haste had a ratio of 1 haste for 1 point for the first 1000 points, then had a .5 for the 1001th point.<br />
1500 haste was the equivalent of 1250 points.<br />
^ Soft cap was 1000 point.<br />
<br />
Softcap of legendaries :<br />
Past 4 legendaries, the chance of you getting a legendary was severely lower than before.<br />
Therefor ; It is a softcap - It was possible to get more legendaries, but with a severely limited chance of it happening prior to the 4th legendary.<br />
<br />
I'm also laughing at your previous quote of &quot;I have a brain so I can think for myself&quot; when told &quot;the blue himself called it a softcap&quot;.<br />
<br />
My guild's making fun of you too, now. <br />

<br />
You're being deliberately obtuse. First off, the legendary system isn't &quot;true&quot; RNG-- it has bad luck protection built in, which manipulates chances in order to keep you from falling too far onto the bad side of the bell curve. You aren't just rolling a die over and over, which each roll having an equal chance-- each time that you don't roll what you want, they're handing you a new die that's even more weighted towards getting a legendary.<br />
<br />
Up until you hit the softcap, that is. Then they stop. Yes, randomness still plays a role, but there is a softcap. Just because you don't understand what the term means doesn't mean it doesn't apply.</div></div><hr />

Playtime has nothing to do with drop chance. To increase drop chance you have to spend your time doing legendary eligible content. And why should people who spend more time than you farming legendaries be punished?</div></div><hr />

<br />
There was no cap but once you hit 4 Legendary items you wouldn't get the stacking bad luck protection- meaning you're sitting with the absolute lowest chance for a Legendary until Blizzard lifted it.<br />
<br />
For me it doesn't matter that much, I'm stuck at two and haven't seen one for soon 6 weeks. However for those most dedicated that have done over 1000 mythic + dungeons in search of their next (maybe best) Legendary it's a massive fucking mistake. Also what if you were playing Outlaw Rogue and got 3 Legendary items then after nerfs and so on you're now playing Assassination and you want 2 Assassination Legendary items? You couldn't.<br />
Most specs have 2-3 Legendary items for a particular spec, the softcap ment you couldn't play the different specs properly.</div></div><hr />

If you want to argue that removing the protection at four is bad, that's fine<br />
If you want to argue that Blizzard did something wrong by withholding that information, I don't really see it. They made that decision regardless of sharing it with the playerbase and they never lied about anything. People would be farming for a fifth, sixth, etc legendary regardless of whether they knew how hard it would be.<br />
The problem is that they didn't just withold the information, they released information that seemingly implied that there was no softcap. If you say &quot;there's bad luck protection, and here's how it works&quot;, but you specifically avoid mentioning the softcap, then you're misleading the players, intentionally or not.</div></div><hr />

Everytime they've dropped they were a nice surprise. I retained one in Eye off worm boss, one from a cache reward, and one of a world boss. I don't do raids, I do however spam the M+ system. I wouldn't say they were ever mandatory, players only make things mandatory today because the players set the bar for what's mandatory. <br />
<br />
Strangely, the greatest belly achers about the system are the raiders because the guilds hold not having legendaries on the responsibility of the players and seem to blame their own progression to a lack of having them in certain roles. I can agree with THIS system, because how many guilds you see out there have those people who only log in to raid, do a handful of WQs, and then log. It's going to require time clocked in the max level content to beat the odds. If you consider 10 bosses a week grinding them out, then you were doing it wrong all along, and your odds of getting them are rightly reduced. Hanging out in Dal is not content. Completing only AP WQs is not completing content.<br />
<br />
What I've found worked for me in this whole mess is simple. Don't expect them to drop, and consider any one that drops for you just a nice surprise. A watched pot never boils. I know, wrong audience.</div></div><hr />

The system did not stop anyone from getting more than 4 Legendaries, it simply did not give you the &quot;Bad Luck&quot; protection any longer. The drop rate was simply the &quot;base&quot; drop rate of 0.001% or whatever it is set to.<br />
<br />
I don't play enough so I doubt I will ever get a single legendary unless they change it to a guaranteed drop from a specific kill at some point. It should have been a token system, but clearly none of us &quot;arm-chair&quot; devs know what is best for the game, I guess they need to keep people playing somehow.</div></div><hr />

I posted about this a few pages back-- that is the definition of a softcap.<br />
<br />
<br />
A softcap doesn't mean &quot;you can't go beyond this point no matter what&quot;, it means &quot;past this point, further progress is harder/slower/less effective&quot;.<br />
<br />
For instance, specs which have their GCD reduced by haste have a softcap on haste-- once they reach a 1 second GCD, their GCD can't go any lower. Haste continues to have a benefit beyond that point-- it'll increase attack speeds, cast times, and reduce the cooldowns of certain abilities, but its value diminishes.<br />
<br />
This is distinct from a hardcap, which is when progress past a certain point simply isn't possible (or provides no further benefit). Crit, for instance, has a functional hardcap at 100%-- once you're critting on every attack, there is no benefit to getting more of it. Similarly, if they decided to make it so that you simply couldn't get higher than 20% crit, then the hardcap would be 20%.<br />
<br />
It's also possible for something to have both a softcap and a hardcap. Going back to the crit example above, let's say that they made it so that once you get more than 10% crit, each subsequent point of crit rating provides half of its normal value. You would then have a softcap at 10% and a hardcap at 20%.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes you could, but there was no bad luck protection after 4th one, so there was a soft cap. People don't seem to understand what soft cap means. Soft cap just means legendaries drop like any other item. So difference here was that up to 4th legendary there was a certain baseline dropchance + the increased dropchance from badluck protection.<br />
<br />
So before fix. your chances increased for every legendary eligible content up until you got 4 legendaries. After that it was just a small baseline chance from each boss. You could still get a 5th one. But let's say each boss in mythic has a 0.1% chance of a drop a legendary. 1 - 0.999^1000 = 9.5% to get a legendary item from one of the bosses if you do 1000 bosses. But with bad luck protection that number(we don't exactly know how much each eligible content adds to the drop chance) could be like 50% or even higher after 1000 bosses.</div></div><hr />

Per character.<br />
<br />
Any time you complete something that can drop a legendary but one doesn't drop, you get an increased chance the next time you do something that can drop a legendary. This stacks until you get a legendary.<br />
<br />
Blizzard mentioned on how long it should take on average for a player to see a legendary, I forget what it was but the week you saw them drop like candy was the week they said it would be. <br />
<br />
Some guy attempted to do the math after that to predict the chance of it dropping but this was a while ago and chances are it was wrong.</div></div><hr />

Softcap of legendaries :<br />
Past 4 legendaries, the chance of you getting a legendary was severely lower than before.<br />
Therefor ; It is a softcap - It was possible to get more legendaries, but with a severely limited chance of it happening prior to the 4th legendary.<br />
<br />
I'm also laughing at your previous quote of &quot;I have a brain so I can think for myself&quot; when told &quot;the blue himself called it a softcap&quot;.<br />
<br />
My guild's making fun of you too, now. <br />
<br />
We are all standing here laughing at what you just wrote. Past 4 legendaries normal RNG applies. 0 to 4 legendaries Blizzard is helping entitled players not unsubscribe because someone else got lucky and they didn't. NOONE LIMITS YOUR CHANCE PAST 4. THEY JUST DONT GIVE YOU EXTRA FREE LOOT.<br />
<br />
You are so entitled that you can't see through the hard facts. Giving you bad luck protection is not normal. They don't give you bad luck protection when running Ulduar for Mimiron's Head do they? Bad luck protection was introduced to stop the endless streams of QQ. However it had to stop somewhere. So things become NORMAL at 4 legendaries and then how do the entitled kids interprete it? &quot;Blizzard nerfed drops&quot; &quot;Blizzard capped us&quot;. <br />
<br />
Yeah ok you are capped. All the while Im sitting on 6 legendaries because Im special. Bye now. Go do some mythic +2 and pray you dont get another Sephuz.</div></div><hr />

At no point was it said there was a soft cap all they said was that past 4 normal luck took place without buffs against bad luck.<br />
<br />
Normal luck means you can still win the lottery any time any place but your chance is not buffed.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
That's why it's called &quot;soft cap&quot; not &quot;hard cap&quot;. I.e you can still get legendaries but the chances were lower for the 5th one than for the 4th one if you more than one legendary eligible content. And the more content you did the difference in chance became greater between 4th and 5th which really would screw over a lot of people, just not hardcore raiders in the long run. Imagine if you're a casual and finally got your 4th legendary, but all were bad ones. Well now your chances of getting a 5th one is much slimmer. If hardcore raiders are frustrated to the point that they are rerolling, imagine how a that casual that don't have the time to reroll would feel? That's why blizzard admitted it they had a &quot;soft cap&quot; and that they are removing it.</div></div><hr />

i remember reading a blue post on the EU half of things where they said the more end game content you play the higher chances you'll have of getting a legendary. that notion kind of peeves. because i read into it if i keep feeding the slot machine coins eventually it'll let me win no matter how big or little the winnings are. If it is like a Slot machine, then a person could go the entire expansion with out seeing a legendary. where as i have seen people get back to back legendaries from doing mythic plus dungeons in the same day. i seriously don't buy into their bad luck protection bs.</div></div><hr />

After getting four legendaries bad luck protection no longer works so the chances of getting #5 are heavily reduced. You can still get #5 but its pretty rare.

<br />
If that was the case, literally no one would have a Sephuz or Pyradaz and they would be worthless legendaries (until 7.1.5 when Pyr becomes the best tanking legendary and Seph gets a use boost as well).</div></div><hr />

<br />
You call it &quot;reduced chance&quot; I call it &quot;back to normal&quot;. When they make Skirmish event and you get extra honor from skirmishes after the event is over do you say &quot;I won't go play skirmishes because its reduced honor now&quot;. Its not reduced its the normal.<br />
<br />
And another thing. First 4 have boost for all. So you have boost i have boost everyone has boost. So you get your 4. Then its back to normal RNG. You can still get 5-6-7. The guy with 0 has a catch up. This doesn't mean Blizzard punished you or nerfed your chances or gated you or capped you. People want to play the victim and say &quot;oh I only got 4 and now its all over&quot;. No its not. If the chance before bad luck protection was 0.01% you have that 0.01%. If its not enough for you thats your problem but its not a cap. Its the way things work in any mmo. <br />
<br />
A soft cap would be: After the first 4 legendaries you can only get 1 per month. Thats a soft cap. Saying &quot;you have a chance to win the lottery depending on how many times you play&quot; is by no means a cap. Roll the times 100 times a day and if lucky you get 100 legendaries.

Some people have defined here &quot;soft cap&quot; as a temporary cap for legendaries you can get.<br />
<br />
Well if they did, they were probably not affected, or had any knowledge of the system in the first place. Most people who were affected knew you could get a 5th legendary, but if chances were much much smaller to get 5th one it was a legit concern of theirs, then what people interpreted their concern as is a separate question . Like you can probably get 3 legendaries in a row from normal mythic, but what are chances 0.00000001%? The exorsus post even mentioned specifically that the bad luck protection seemed to be missing, not the dropchance altogether.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Soft cap means that you have a very small chance to get 5th legendary.<br />
By looking at how stingy Blizzard is, the chance is close to a million to one.<br />
...<br />
My guess is 10000 to 1.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">barackohmama</div><div class="date">2016-11-24, 08:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You call it &quot;reduced chance&quot; I call it &quot;back to normal&quot;. When they make Skirmish event and you get extra honor from skirmishes after the event is over do you say &quot;I won't go play skirmishes because its reduced honor now&quot;. Its not reduced its the normal.<br />
<br />
And another thing. First 4 have boost for all. So you have boost i have boost everyone has boost. So you get your 4. Then its back to normal RNG. You can still get 5-6-7. The guy with 0 has a catch up. This doesn't mean Blizzard punished you or nerfed your chances or gated you or capped you. People want to play the victim and say &quot;oh I only got 4 and now its all over&quot;. No its not. If the chance before bad luck protection was 0.01% you have that 0.01%. If its not enough for you thats your problem but its not a cap. Its the way things work in any mmo. <br />
<br />
A soft cap would be: After the first 4 legendaries you can only get 1 per month. Thats a soft cap. Saying &quot;you have a chance to win the lottery depending on how many times you play&quot; is by no means a cap. Roll the times 100 times a day and if lucky you get 100 legendaries. Where is the cap in that?<br />
<br />
The bad luck protection system capped at 4 legendaries, why can't you call that a soft cap? That's what most people are refering to at least, even the Exorsus post. Btw what you are talking about are just semantics, i'm not sure why you are doing it when there's no real reason to. Whatever you want to call it, there was no bad luck protection after 4th legendary, and that's what matters to the discussion. If you want to discuss gaming vocabulary or definitions I'm sure there are other threads better suited.<br />
<br />
Kinda funny to see people who bluntly argued that there was no changes to droprate after 4th one and people were just unlucky individuals now switches over to a discussion about semantics when they were proven wrong.</div></div><hr />

Mate you don't need my permission to call it whatever. All Im saying is that its an addon system. Its not normal RNG. So after the addon is removed you are NOT screwed. You are just back to your own luck. Thats all Im saying. You wanna feel bad about system removed after 4? Wanna call it a softcap and request its extension? Ok but know what you are asking. You are basically asking blizzard to screw RNG for drop favoritism. So one step closer to shopping legendaries from a vendor.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ah yes, the ole ignorance on Randomness comes through once again! <br />
<br />
Lets talk about it shall we? <br />
<br />
A 1/1000 chance to drop is 1/1000 each time the die rolls regardless of how many times you roll it. Some seemingly miracle can happen (this is 1 in a trillion chance) in that you get 4 legendary items in a row, or you might see some horrid luck with 4000 rolls and not see that legendary, that's just how probability works. Luckily Blizzard increases your odds for every WQ, Dungeon, Raid, Mythic+, and BG you do. They increase your odds based on the level of difficulty you are completing, so a Mythic+ dungeoneer and Mythic raider will up their drop chance at a faster rate than a casual that plays 4 hours a week. With that said, it might be that Blizzard needs to up the rate at which the drop chance increases based on higher levels of difficulty as we are still seeing people that just run LFR running around with Legos over Mythic Raiders since EN was released.</div></div><hr />

I honestly think this dev team feels they have something to prove. Going back to deterministic systems that worked perfectly well in the past would feel like a failure to them. They need to prove that they can come up with something better than the old WoW team, even if they can't.</div></div><hr />

The softcap means you lost your &quot;bad luck protection&quot; bonus. So forever more you had the base line % chance at getting a 5th legendary no matter how many failed rolls you got.</div></div><hr />

They changed Legendary items so that anyone could get one. It's a way to make the game more casual. You really can't win with either a casual friendly system or a hardcore friendly system. Some people will feel left out. It's all about dealing with the pros and cons.</div></div><hr />

Well i'm fine with either, just as long as there's not a threshold that &quot;forces&quot; you to reroll to improve your char. They could scrap the bad luck protection altogether for what I care, but if it's worth rerolling or even deleting your legendaries it's not a good system.</div></div><hr />

wtf is that suppose to mean? When the cap discussion brought up, ppl still said &quot;Rng is Rng&quot; just like when the drop bug was around. They were wrong two times in a row now.

Now the only step missing is to allow us to target specific legendaries in some way!<br />
<br />
there was no empirical evidence though cause tons of people had over 4, and so little people had 4 in comparison to 0-1-2-3 that it made it hard to see any evidence, as it all seemed to be bias statistics</div></div><hr />

<br />
Everytime i see you avatar i puke a little in my mouth. That's how worthless and shitty your &quot;opinions&quot; are.<br />
<br />
Shall i copy pasta the evidence again and fucking again? Are you and motorfucker really this fucking dense?<br />
<br />
Copypasta number 100000:<br />
<br />
I will put it very simply for all those &quot;there is no softcap&quot; people out there, so even they can grasp what is happening. Especially after reading shit like &quot;lol exorsus bullshits about legendaries to distract from their exploits&quot;.<br />
<br />
EVERY topguild out there has the same problem. EVERY FUCKING TOPGUILD. So lets do some very simple dumbed down math, shall we?<br />
<br />
Let's look at the top 10 guilds worldwide: If 200 people get their first 3-4 legendaries in their first 400 runs. (For the sake of simplicity we will just say 4) That indicates that the dropchance of legendaries per myth+run/per person was around 1%, before they changed something.<br />
<br />
Which means every run had a 99% chance for you to not get a legendary. 10 runs 90% for no legendary. 100 runs 37%. 400 runs 1.7%.<br />
<br />
Those people got that many legendaries in that many runs. So anyone disputing this is honestly just a moron. These are fucking facts every raider in a topguild who no-lifed myth+ will and can confirm.<br />
<br />
What happend then?<br />
<br />
Legendaries just stopped dropping for people who farmed an insane amount of mythics+.<br />
<br />
So what are the chances for 200 people to not get a SINGLE legendary in 400 runs you might ask? Let's see. If one person has a 1.7% chance to get no legendary in 400 runs. The chance for 200 people to get no legendary in 400 runs is ... 0,017^200.<br />
<br />
I hope you don't really want me to actually calculate that, i will just give you the chance for it to happent to 5 people simultaneously.<br />
<br />
5 people no legendaries in 400 runs = 0,0000001419857% chance for that happen (before the nerfs/softcap/whatever obviously)<br />
<br />
So do you really fucking believe blizzard and all those retards talking out of their ass with their 0,0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 00000000000000000001% (many zeros missing) fucking chance for that to happen?<br />
<br />
Really? Are we that fucking stupid in 2016? Well, i guess Trump and Brexit happened to, so why do i even fuckin ask in the fuckin first place?<br />
<br />
Inb4: But but but not enough data, mimimi. Id you fukcing want to accumulate all the data of people who only ran 10 myths+? So you can throw it out since their numbers are to low to be worth anything? The top raiding guilds consist of the people farming the most. So taking all the fucking data from people with the most myth+ runs out there is fucking enough, you idiot.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Lol please stop. &quot;tons of people had over 4&quot; lol what? You mean those &quot;tons&quot; who got their 5-6-7-8 legendaries when the first legendary bug was still in game? Those people are very few since the bug was fixed quite swiftly. Sure call it anecdotal if you want. But the pattern when hundreds of raiders had a much easier time get their 4th than their 5th legendary there should be obvious that there's actually might be a pattern here. This time around it should at least have been more obvious than the first bug that caused people to get increased droprate for their 2nd legendary if they already had one.</div></div><hr />
