For countless millennia, Ulduar has remained undisturbed by mortals, far away from their concerns and their struggles. But since its recent discovery, many have wondered what the structure's original purpose may have been. Some thought it a city, built to herald the glory of its makers; some thought it a vault containing innumerable treasures, perhaps even relics of the mighty Titans themselves. They were wrong. Beyond its gates lies no city, no treasure vault, no final answer to the Titan's mysteries. All that awaits those who dare set foot in Ulduar is a horror even the Titans could not, would not destroy, an evil they merely... contained.<br />
<br />
Beneath ancient Ulduar, the Old God of death lies, whispering.... Tread carefully, or his prison will become your tomb. <br />
<br />
As the next step in tiered raid progression in Wrath of the Lich King, Ulduar is set to blow players away with gorgeous setpieces, sprawling battlefields, and innovative boss encounters. Ulduar's design aims to provide a fun, unique, and innovative raid experience, but it also includes additional challenges - and rewards - for seasoned raiders. In this sneak-peek at World of Warcraft's newest raid dungeon, we'll take a look at some of the new content that makes Ulduar rise above the crop of amazing dungeons already available in World of Warcraft.<br />
<br />
Welcome to Ulduar<br />
Many players have already gotten their Wrath of the Lich King raiding feet wet in Naxxramas and the Sartharion raid, but Ulduar is the first example of the expansion's much larger, truly epic scope of raiding, as will be evident from the second you set foot in the instance. The most obvious difference between Ulduar and its predecessors is that the dungeon actually comprises two separate raid areas. The first section is an epic battle against a vast army standing between you and the entrance of the dungeon proper; in the second area, you will dive into the heart of the dungeon itself and finally discover the secrets of Ulduar.<br />
<br />
Ulduar's new master has rallied his own massive Iron Army to guard the entrance to Ulduar and to prevent any unwanted guests - including you, especially you - from reaching the inner sanctum. Thankfully, you'll be able to face the Iron Army on even footing: although the main Horde and Alliance forces are focused on the forces beyond the Wrathgate and on each other, some who are better able to appreciate the true magnitude of Ulduar's threat have managed to scrap together a small fleet of siege vehicles to aid you in the assault.<br />
<br />
You and your friends will have to use these vehicles wisely to break through Ulduar's defenses. A mix of motorcycles, demolishers, and siege engines will be at your disposal, each granting unique abilities to the pilot and the passenger. Motorcycle drivers, for example, can create pools of liquid tar that snare opponents and can be set on fire by area effect attacks, while demolisher passengers can load themselves into the vehicle's catapult so that the pilot can launch them into the distance. If used judiciously, these and other abilities will help decimate the Iron Army and any other threats lying in wait between you and Ulduar.<br />
<br />
One such threat is the Flame Leviathan. After you've plowed through the innumerable ranks of the Iron Army, you will be confronted by an enormous tank. Mimiron built the Flame Leviathan as part of the V0-L7R-0N weapons platform, which means that it packs quite a punch. Normal spells and abilities won't be enough to take down this juggernaut, so you will have to rely on your siege vehicles to outmaneuver and defeat the boss. After wearing the massive war machine down, you will have to launch players onto the tank's back to destroy its defense turrets and sabotage the Leviathan before you can move on. Of course, if you'd like an additional challenge beyond this naturally frantic (but extremely fun) fight, you can try your hand at one of the Flame Leviathan's different Hard Modes (see sidebar).<br />
<br />
Of course, the vehicle gauntlet, the Iron Army, and the battle against the Flame Leviathan are only the start of World of Warcraft's most ambitious raid to date. Patch 3.1 will hit the Public Test Realms very soon, so you will be able to see for yourself what other challenges await beyond the gates of ancient Ulduar.<br />
<br />
Hard Boiled<br />
Ulduar brilliantly illustrates the new design challenges and innovations that come with the bigger scope of the expansion's raids. In order to make raid content more accessible, it has to offer a lot of variety, but it also needs to include a very granular means for players to adjust a raid's difficulty. This concept was first realized in the Burning Crusade with the introduction of Heroic mode, and Wrath of the Lich King is developing the idea even further with new Hard Modes.<br />
<br />
Boss fights that have a Hard Mode are affected by certain variables which players can control and which change the encounter's difficulty. For example, spread throughout Ulduar's vehicle section are four defense towers you can destroy. The more towers you leave intact, the harder the encounter with the Flame Leviathan will be, but the loot will also be better.<br />
<br />
Ulduar isn't the first dungeon to include Hard Mode, but it certainly makes the most use of it. Out of 14 bosses, 11 will have a Hard Mode that offers additional challenges and rewards. Ulduar will appeal to a wide range of play styles, but the dungeon also has great longevity and a high replay value.</div></div><hr />

Hardcore modes and 'normal' modes. And with different loot.<br />
<br />
But prepare to immense amounts of spam from people with &quot;I hate vehicles&quot;.<br />
Personally I think it's fun with some different boss encounters.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Vehicles in raids sound awesome; especially since it's not like everyone has to be in one. It just seems like an epic WC3 battle only done in WoW. (They've stated before they wanted to do this.)<br />
<br />
The hard modes will also be very interesting. Really looking forward to diving into the Ulduar PTR and attempting these bosses.</div></div><hr />

<br />
BRING ON THE PTRS!</div></div><hr />

If thats the case though, I won't mind. I hate vehicles, but I'm fine with it if I don't HAVE to use it. <br />

Everyone in vehicles would be totally retarded though</div></div><hr />

I don't think one encounter with siege vehicles is the end of the world. Now if they use this even more, I will probably be more with the previous comments in not appreciating their inclusion.<br />
<br />
Overall, just from that reading, I am very excited.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shinshiva</div><div class="date">2009-02-17, 06:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">/sigh. I honestly can't believe some of you are already complaining about the vehicles. Looks like you guys miss out on a raid. Pussys.<br />
<br />
Aaaaanyways, I can't wait for this to come out! Looks like Yogg will be making at least a showing of some sort :) And 14 (!) bosses almost definitely means we'll get the Watchers as either bosses or npc's that we have to free from a prison guarded by dark avatars of themselves :D</div></div><hr />

It sounds like Hyjal, but more thought out and better! Then you actually get into the heart of the instance, where the real boss fights will take place.<br />
<br />
Also, i don't know about the rest of you, but i'd love to be catapulted onto the tank to knock out it's last defenses! That's going to be awesome!</div></div><hr />

I for one do enjoy the change of pace that vehicles bring, and it sounds as though it is only the first encounter so it should be fine. I was actually hoping for a few more bosses, but 11 hard modes sound sweet.</div></div><hr />

Know what I mean? Get a bunch of people together, hop in vehicles, blow some stuff up, limited strategy + coordination required, and you get some OK loot pretty much for free.<br />
<br />
Then the &quot;actual&quot; raid is what lies beyond.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'd use the crappy default UI if I weren't playing a class that DEMANDS I run 24 different totems at any time, 4 weapon buffs, a half dozen different heal spells and maybe some offensive spells if I wanted to use them occassionally. <br />
<br />
Seriously blizz. Fix the classes, cut down on the useful number of abilities so people can actually push buttons that interact in the game without requiring us to fix your crappy UI which only breaks when you want to do something &quot;new and exciting&quot;.</div></div><hr />

which means you will have to suffer through the boringness of this &quot;inactual&quot; event week after week before getting to do your &quot;actual&quot; raid. It'll probably be cool the first time, and then it's just a waste of time to slow you down.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What I'm hoping is that it's either a limited run-time event, like a world event of old but instanced...<br />
<br />
...or after you complete it once you can skip right to the actual raid instance every other time. If they did it this way the item(s) you get as loot from this big battle thingy would have to also drop in the &quot;real&quot; raid instance.</div></div><hr />

Sounds like my days on WoW are ending. I expect there will be a lot of people feeling the same way.<br />
<br />
Nothing like straying as far towards Counterstrike as possible. Didn't start playing WoW for the guns and tanks and planes. It's pretty sad really.<br />
<br />
Loved the dragons as part of the Malygos fight, but not interested in even more metal war vehicles to have to work around crappy controls, and I doubt that anyone who doesn't pvp will be all that interested either.<br />

Nothing like straying as far towards Counterstrike as possible. Didn't start playing WoW for the guns and tanks and planes. It's pretty sad really.<br />
<br />
Loved the dragons as part of the Malygos fight, but not interested in even more metal war vehicles to have to work around crappy controls, and I doubt that anyone who doesn't pvp will be all that interested either.<br />
<br />
Sacred 2 for the XBox 360 is looking better and better, and it's out in stores today ;D<br />

Sounds like you've confused Counterstrike with Battlefield / Unreal Tournament / Call of Duty, you name it... As far as I know, Counterstrike has never had planes, and not tanks either. Vehicles maybe, but certainly not tanks.<br />

I for one look forward to some change of pace, from fighting all the undead mobs in Naxx :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think the vehicle part will be a lot of fun. What it sounds like is not everyone will be using vehicles, but the vehicles will be important to the strategy of getting people where they need to go and taking down groups. I think it sounds brilliant.<br />
<br />
I mean it just makes sense that armies would be using vehicles like real armies do. Why would a fantasy army with magic not have fantastic siege machines and personnel carriers?</div></div><hr />

Your argument fails. The way YOU have dominos configured works great for you. For me to use it the way I need to, it DOESNT work and I need to have a separate set of keys configured for vehicle combat which is terribly inconvenient and uncomfortable and generally unusable.</div></div><hr />

This isn't going to just be Malygos v1.1, there will be at least 3 very different vehicles, with both pilot and passenger positions on each with varying skills based on which position you're in. Throw that in with a very intense gauntlet, 4 increased levels of difficulty based on towers destroyed, and the fact that the end of the fight will require you to get back on your own character while on the leviathan's back, and you have a great way to kick-start Ulduar raiding.<br />

Anyone who complains about it fitting the theme, yeah... who cares, they're dumb. Vehicles have been in warcraft since warcraft 2.<br />

Fact of the matter is that... hey look, I ground my way to 80 off quests, geared up and.... get to drive a tank that now has NOTHING to do with the character I worked so hard on. Yeehaw, what fun. My character now means nothing. THAT is the problem.</div></div><hr />

Dude riding on that guy in Zul'Drak was awesome. I don't know why people hate this quest so much. Sure there were some clipping issues but I never got stuck in the terrain so bad that I couldn't jump my way out in a few seconds. I felt like this guy was my buddy. Good times. I think I might one of the people Blizzard is catering this game more towards. I've enjoyed the new stuff, the vehicle stuff gives me a good sense of accomplishment because I CAN'T use my gear to make it easier, and I've done Sarth3D on 25 man. I like it.

God.. where do you even start with people like you? You want to complain, go ahead, but you are not complaining, you are crying in every sense of the word. No one has even played this yet, or seen it at all and already it's going to SUCK 100%. Do you listen to yourself? Try taking the positive approach for once you fat emo bastard.<br />
<br />
There is nothing wrong with a vehicle section to start a raid. The variety is WELCOME and you will have to be out of the vehicle and actually playing your character to kill the boss so take joy in that.<br />
<br />
Just relax and enjoy the Epic adventure they are trying to create for you for CRYING out loud.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm not a HUGE fan of the vehicles, but it's different, and will probably look pretty badass in a 25 man raid fighting a big army. <br />
<br />
It still amazes me that people just complain and complain, about every single decision Blizzard makes. They say they're a terrible company and the game is useless. Yet they STILL, after all this time pay their subscriptions. I just don't get it. Try Ulduar once it comes out, and if the vehicles truly ruin the entire game for you, quit already, I'm tired of hearing everyone whine about how terrible this game is before they log on for the night.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Winterfail has got nothing to do with real PvP at all. Go into a vehicle, drive as long as you can then blow up then rince and repeat. You can fight naked in there or better still be a level 1 becasue it won't make any difference at all. Gearing up and using you char is what this game is about for me and many others. Riding around in stupid vehicles that totally negate your char isn't.<br />
Now add all the bugs, lag, faction imblance etc and you get Winterfail.<br />
<br />
Like others said, it's been hard work to gear your char up so you can face encounters better and to have it nullified by vehicles is just fail. Not all of us enjoy vehicles either and I personally dislike them a lot.<br />
Everything with vehicles has also been ridden with bugs and have taken many fixes to sort out so yea, that part really made me dissapointed to hear about.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
PERFECT<br />
<br />
The vehicles will be a great part where your guild can try out the teamwork part, i love how blizzard is turning this into a teamwork game every single patch,<br />
Its funny tho when you say vehicle some people instantly think its like Wintergrasp or something i mean with iron tanks etc. Vehicles can mean that i can be anything that a player can use like a freaking malygos mount etc. blizzard your doing one hell of a job and i like it allot. <br />
<br />
Ulduar will be one hell of a nice raid 10 and 25 man, i realy love how your working with the hard modes now and i think you have improved the game allot more then you did in TBC :P <br />
<br />
Blizzard keep up the exelent work your doing now and dont mind the whining people that when they read something they instantly read bad things about it......<br />
<br />
they cant please 10 milion people at one time, so if you dont like the game why the hell did you level to 80 then? since your whining prolly since lvl 60 naxx saying stupid 40 mans. and now saying stupid 25 mans.<br />
<br />
to all the people who support blizzard/me: We can see allot of potention more into the future<br />
To all the people who are always Q.Q: stop moaning and try making a game like this yourself and try and pull over 10 million players.<br />
<br />

People wouldn't complain if they didn't care. They complain because they love the game and see something in it that they don't like.<br />
<br />
Personally, I'm not a big fan of the vehicle stuff. I rolled a Holy Pally. Not a dragon, not a tank, not a motorcycle or a cannon. I rolled a Holy Pally because that's what I wanted to play. Blizzard forcing the whole raid into these other things rubs me wrong.<br />
<br />
I will definately hold judgement until I see more. And a little bit here or there won't kill me. But saying stuff like, &quot;If you don't like it then quit&quot; is pretty dumb.

No you're completely right, and I wasn't really referring to you. You have intelligent points to make. I'm referring to the other people in this thread like the one I pointed out, someone said the game is worthless, I bet you that guy plays 2+ hours tonight.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Foshiggidy</div><div class="date">2009-02-17, 08:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Everyone QQ'n about vehicles is over-reacting extremely. Vehicles and siege vehicles have ALWAYS been part of the Warcraft series. As another poster stated, the technology wasn't there 4 years ago but is now. Go play Warcraft 2 or 3 and show me where there is a 2v2 arena going on in the middle of nowhere...<br />
<br />
Either way, another poster had it right: 30 bosses - and now 2 bosses with this mechanic being used. RELAX! It sounds like it will be a 10 minute or less event to get to the tank and then a traditional boss fight. Not everyone has to use the vehicles but SOMEONE does. So out of 25 people, I am sure there are a few that don't have sand in their va-jay-jay's about using vehicles to get you through this.<br />
<br />
I like the idea. Not a huge fan of vehicles but I don't hate them either. But yea, using vehicles fits into WoW lore and history more than arenas and BGs...but of course, I'd imagine the ones complaining about this are the ones that play 300 2s games a week.<br />
<br />
To the people saying they are going to quit cause this is dumb: Good-BYE!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I can't imagine 14 more fights just as buggy as malygos (and yes, I know, i'm overexaggerating)<br />

Still though, I hate the idea. It should go back to the good ol days of requiring the right gear and skill, and maybe a bit of luck.</div></div><hr />

Thank you for a post that isn't &quot;Vehicles will suck no matter what&quot; or &quot;Stfu vehicles are awsome&quot;<br />
And personally I like the idea of vehicles. It makes the instance a lot harder to PuG and involves only skill but blizzard will have to pull it off much better then the other PvE vehicle fights.</div></div><hr />

^^ This is the adult approach. <br />
Which separates you nicely from people that share your reservations.<br />
<br />
How anyone can derive anything negative from the preview is beyond me. They didn't really say anything about anything and people are drawing their own gloom and doom conclusions. <br />
<br />
You may not like vehicles and because of that be hesitant, but have faith. Hopefully blizzard has learned enough about their new game play mechanic to make this fun and challenging.</div></div><hr />

No but they might want to please a few more than 5 million to keep the revenue base they currently have. It seems like almost half of these posts are negative so do the math. <br />

I've loved every expansion and in particular WotLK to date, and I have never commented on a forum before reading this preview.<br />
<br />
I don't enjoy pvp and running machines is where you can go and do that. I'm fine with machines being part of battleground instances, but true pve raiding guilds are likely going to have a hard time maintaining their membership as people stop playing. <br />
<br />
I have been a loyal player for more than three years and know lots of people who will be looking for a new game to play. Money talks people, and it might just end up yelling. <br />

I hope Blizzard is listening. I wonder how people on the Roleplaying servers will feel? Honestly !!! How does the description of this fight even fit in with that? lol</div></div><hr />

The first boss has you enter 1 of 3 different vehicles (Chopper, Demolisher, and Siege Engine) to fight your way through an immense Iron army to the Flame Leviathan and defeat him. After that, there's very little use of vehicles by players. We'll have the fight up on the PTR at a later date, but this fight isn't in the first wave of boss encounters to be tested.

...doesn't really make sense to me. You wanted them to do something new, and they did - don't complain. While we all love some old content, going back to the way things were is not how we should do it.<br />
<br />
For example, I really like BWL and I think the Vael fight is one of the coolest encounters in WoW. However, if they made another boss where you get unlimited energy/mana/etc, it would be lame because it's not new. After this many raids, Blizz is trying something new - let them try it.</div></div><hr />

Could be but I suspect that blizzard doesn't want to annoy people by promising 14 boss which most people will assume are encounters and then giving us less. Also the statement 11 of the 14 bosses will have hard modes suggests that they mean there will be 14 encounters.</div></div><hr />

I can't imagine 14 more fights just as buggy as malygos (and yes, I know, i'm overexaggerating)<br />
<br />
Still though, I hate the idea. It should go back to the good ol days of requiring the right gear and skill, and maybe a bit of luck.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm just curious but where did it say that you will use vehicles in the whole raiding instance?!<br />
<br />
Just for the people that are QQing like mad here, you will only use vehicles in ONE phase in ONE encounter out of 14 encounters.</div></div><hr />

To quote myself quoting someone whining about vehicles negating the contribution of acquired gear:<br />

Actually, the effectiveness of the vehicles in the Flame Leviathan fight changes depending on the quality of the gear. So someone in full Naxxramas epics (or Ulduar epics!) will have an easier time than someone in greens.<br />

Oh, good. A couple other people did see it too. I only skimmed the first pages of this thread. The vehicle bickering was a bit much.<br />
<br />
I do have to add that my view has been swayed somewhat. Another concern that I had but didn't really mention was that vehicles at the moment absolutely negate all the hard work I've put into my gear. With this new tidbit from the developer about the vehicle scaling with gear, that at least seems to be taken care of.<br />

The real sense of achievement comes the first time you kill a boss. Killing a boss a second time with some adds up does not create that feeling, no matter how much they flash the word &quot;achievement&quot; in your face. Why not just put the hard mode into 25 man version and the normal mode into 10 man?<br />
<br />
Also they should use the vehicle mechanics in at most one fight. People enjoy learning their classes, finding optimal rotations and working out the nuances of pushing out maximum performance. Throwing them into a motorcycle with one button to shoot a rocket and another button to spray tar might be a nice gimmick, but it gets real old real fast. Also scaling vehicles with gear just means that you throw on the highest ilevel gear regardless of whether they're actually good for you or not.</div></div><hr />

Believe it or not there are actual guilds just dedicated to the 10 man only route through these instances why should we not be able to have these hard modes? 10 man only guilds dont want easy encounters we just want to do hard content with a smaller much more dedicated group.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because it makes sense that you need more people to overcome harder challenges. By your argument there should also be 5 man content and solo content that's just as hard to do as the largest raids. Building a 25-man raiding guild is a lot more challenging than a 10-man raiding guild, going through that effort should be a required part to beat the hardest content.<br />
<br />
Also saying 10-man teams are &quot;much more dedicated&quot; is just not true. If anything 25-man guilds require more people to be more dedicated. You don't need the GM-officer-class leader structure to run a successful 10-man guild, but will definitely need it to run a 25-man guild. Taking on that extra organizational load takes a lot dedication.</div></div><hr />

Do you honestly enjoy killing a boss and then every week HAVE to kill him the same way? I don't at least, optional hard modes is a win win-situation no matter how you look at it and prolongs the lifespan of a boss so you can enjoy it more.<br />
<br />

Re-Read the post there is nowhere i said 10 mans are much more dedicated (My comments about running 10 mans with a much more dedicated group was to do with my past experinces of slack 25 man guilds and how you can still clear content with half the raid being bad or not dedicated).... I said there ARE guilds who dedicate thier time just to the 10 man content and STILL want HARD modes.<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh yeah i forgot that the hardest content in the game so far comes from the 25 man version ... oh no it doesnt does it ....<br />
<br />
Anyways making things HARD isnt about numbers within your raid force..(it would if it was real life but it isnt is it). it makes no difference if your 10/25/40 man there should be no requirement for hard modes just because you choose to play with more players than the next guild.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">VeeVee</div><div class="date">2009-02-18, 02:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">A &quot;few&quot; posts? I read 5 pages worth, I really don't think the next 6 had anything new to offer.<br />
<br />
With over unique 120 raid encounters (not including Naxxramas duplicates) to date in WoW's history, only one of them has incorporated vehicle technology. <br />
<br />
That's at least 119 other bosses over a period of 4 years where people have approached the fight with the same repetitive task. The only fluctuations are limited to &quot;kill the adds&quot;, &quot;click this cube&quot;, &quot;throw a core&quot;, &quot;avoid the aoe&quot; or &quot;dispel the debuffs.&quot; <br />
<br />
Blizzard introduces another 14 encounters to the mix, and one of them includes phases of vehicle technology. These are the complaints that stand out the most:<br />
<br />
- People immediately cling to their beliefs that it's going to be &quot;too easy&quot;, because the only other encounter in the game to use such technology was also easy. Blizzard never claimed Malygos - along with all launch content - was intended to be difficult. It was an introduction to the addition of vehicular combat in a raid environment. And you have to admit - it was pretty damn cool the first time you saw it. (Which appears to be another major concern - &quot;It was fun the first time, but now it's just annoying.&quot; I think the gear scaling will alleviate this a bit, as it appears to be one of the reasons Occulus is so unpopular.)<br />
<br />
- The over-exaggeration that Blizzard is &quot;overdoing&quot; vehicular combat in their raid design. 2 out of 32+ WotLK raid encounters is hardly imposing.<br />
<br />
- The ignorant whine that &quot;we spend months farming Naxx so we can drive around on motorcycles and tanks.&quot; These idiots simply can't read. It clearly says the vehicles scale with gear, and it's ONE fight. Besides, all of your precious gear can be put to good use while you Shield Slam, Frostfire, Mutilate and Holy Light faceroll your way through the other thirteen encounters. This also applies to the &quot;I play a Mage, not a Motorbike&quot; crap. Oh dear, one fight where you press a few different buttons!? Don't have a panic attack buddy - you can go back to your mindless 20 hours-per-week of Frostfire spamming once he's dead. Either that or just whine to your raid leader that you wanna be catapulted onto the tank or you'll refuse to raid or something equally melodramatic.<br />
<br />
- &quot;Waaaaghh, vehicles don't work properly.&quot; Learn how to fix/use/customise your mods or don't use them. There's probably a dozen people who are perfectly happy with the way their mods interact with the vehicle UI for every idiot who simply sits back and whines about it.<br />
<br />
As for all the other general complaints - no-one is forcing you to play. If you are really so upset by it, just stop playing and move on with your lives. It'd be nice to read one of these threads to find the little gems of useful information without having to filter through the repetitive garbage posts complaining for the sake of complaining. <br />
<br />

<br />
..about all those stupid babies who already crying, being scared of something new that they think will be an exact copy of previous vehicle using encounters. <br />
<br />
Yes, a vehicle shouldn't have more than 3-4-or-5 button...or you want to learn all 10-12 new vehicle abilities when you jump in it, and you have few minutes until being attacked?? And why to get different vehicles, therefore forced to play coordinated, when we can get 1 kind, with ALL abilities, to destroy, escape, repair, and just everyone tries to stay alive and kill as many enemy as they can??? Because THAT's boring! <br />
<br />
Another thing... I'm not sure, how many read the whole official post carefully, but complaining about the &quot;boring stuff&quot; of using a vehicle as total bullshit... each vehicle will have their special abilities, and we will need to use these abilites in combination, to overcome the different challenges in that vehicular battle... just as post said: motorcycles dropping an oil spot on ground in front of the enemy lines... then another tank puts it in flame, when the enemy got close to it... then load players from one vehicle to the boss tank, when that phase comes.. all needs coordination, and players will need to work together to avoid chaos and control each part of the battle.. and these are just a few cases.<br />
<br />
if you want to skip, or avoid vehicle battle, then don't do it... and come back here to cry that you want to defeat the endboss, but there is no group, which invites you and ports you for the last boss..<br />
<br />
I will stay open-minded, and not getting overwhelmed of my speculative fears... this way I know I will enjoy every aspect of the new content.<br />

oh BTW---&gt; The first boss has you enter 1 of 3 different vehicles (Chopper, Demolisher, and Siege Engine) to fight your way through an immense Iron army to the Flame Leviathan and defeat him. After that, there's very little use of vehicles by players. We'll have the fight up on the PTR at a later date, but this fight isn't in the first wave of boss encounters to be tested. (Source)<br />

I swear this attitude pisses me off more than anything. No, not what you explain, but people that feels like resuming how everyone whines and how its pointless. Can you stop the crap already? You think posting that adds more than those saying they dislike Vehicles for some reasons?<br />

<br />
You said &quot;we just want to do hard content with a smaller much more dedicated group&quot; implying your group is much more dedicated than any 25 man group. And you're drawing that conclusion based on having been in a failed 25 man guild before joining a successful 10 man guild? You couldn't kill most tier end bosses in TBC with half the raid being bad - all it took was a single bad to wipe on Archi for example.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh yeah i forgot that the hardest content in the game so far comes from the 25 man version ... oh no it doesnt does it ....<br />
<br />
True, this is a total failure of encounter tuning by Blizzard. If 10 mans were supposed to be harder shouldn't they also be dropping higher ilvl loot?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyways making things HARD isnt about numbers within your raid force..(it would if it was real life but it isnt is it). it makes no difference if your 10/25/40 man there should be no requirement for hard modes just because you choose to play with more players than the next guild. <br />
<br />
Yeah, and I want to solo Naxx with hard mode achievements. There's no reason why my one man guild shouldn't be able to do it! Anyway, I'm not saying 10-man content should be faceroll-easy, but I am saying that 25 man content should be the pinnacle of raiding. You need more people to overcome harder challenges, that makes sense. If you want the hardest challenge then build or join a 25 man guild, if you want to have fun with a group of friends then build a 10 man guild.<br />
<br />
Besides, the current achievement mechanics like &quot;fight a boss with extra adds&quot; work in 25 man raids where you have more freedom to bring extra tanks for example. Three drakes should've been the only way to do the encounter in 25 man raids and the normal mode should've been in the 10 man.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The Iron Council<br />
This raid encounter will first start with a debate, you and your other raidmembers are allowed to join The Iron Council at their debate. Trough a series of correct and wel argumented answers, and politically correct questions you will have to convince The Iron Council on giving you epix. On hard mode subjects such as racism and the implemention of vehicle combat will be adressed, to you the task of making your point of view on these subjects clear without the use of cliche terms.<br />
<br />
<br />
Wierd stuff in here.<br />
As to where I stand, I think I've read something about the vehicles being more powerfull when your gear is more powerfull. I personally like the way they try to make these instances less of the same. I personally hope that there are some more fights that do not really involve a boss, but more or less involve an encounter as a whole.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vileeh</div><div class="date">2009-02-18, 09:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Because it makes sense that you need more people to overcome harder challenges. By your argument there should also be 5 man content and solo content that's just as hard to do as the largest raids. Building a 25-man raiding guild is a lot more challenging than a 10-man raiding guild, going through that effort should be a required part to beat the hardest content.<br />
<br />
Also saying 10-man teams are &quot;much more dedicated&quot; is just not true. If anything 25-man guilds require more people to be more dedicated. You don't need the GM-officer-class leader structure to run a successful 10-man guild, but will definitely need it to run a 25-man guild. Taking on that extra organizational load takes a lot dedication.<br />
<br />
<br />
Seems odd to me, playing with 15 people less should to me, make the content a whole lot harder, less people to assign for specific roles. Sarth+3 10 is a good example of this, almost too much to tank. <br />
<br />
PuH!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Exactly, trying to have the same encounter and same hard modes for both 10 and 25 mans has led to the failure of balancing. The original intention of 10 man raids seems to have been to serve as a way for more casual raiding with less experienced people. There was certainly a need in TBC for 10 man progression for guilds that couldn't manage to take the step up to 25 mans.</div></div><hr />

So funny.<br />
<br />
It's true though. I think the first reply about vehicles was about the QQing about the future QQing.<br />
<br />
Most experiences with vehicles (Malygos, Occulus, quest vehicles) hindered my enjoyment of the encounter where they were used. I don't like them personally. I'd rather see them use the dynamic zone-phasing in Ulduar over vehicles. I'll look at it positively that the gear I've gotten will effect how well my vehicle works and deal with it when it comes out.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wardley</div><div class="date">2009-02-18, 12:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">How many people actually thought that 'Chess' was the best encounter in Kara? Cos it's a very similar concept between that and this 'vehicle' boss in Ulduar - take control of something, forget everything you've been doing and just give you 2 or 3 options. The only good thing about Chess was that it was generally a nice, relaxing, easy loot encounter right before the more intense Prince encounter.<br />
<br />
Personally, I don't like the fact that we spend time getting to 80, learning all our skills, checking the best ways of maximise DPS/Armour/Healing or whatver, go and find the best gems, enchants and glyphs and then they go 'Ok, for this boss, we're gonna stick you in a tin bucket and only give you 4 buttons to press'.<br />
<br />
Still, at least it's the first boss so we'll get it over with quickly.</div></div><hr />

The way YOU have dominos configured works great for you. For me to use it the way I need to, it DOESNT work and I need to have a separate set of keys configured for vehicle combat which is terribly inconvenient and uncomfortable and generally unusable. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Then thats down to your personal preference, nothing you can argue about and blame others for. If its difficult for you, reconfigure and get over it ffs. times change, roll with it or gtfo tbh.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Fact of the matter is that... hey look, I ground my way to 80 off quests, geared up and.... get to drive a tank that now has NOTHING to do with the character I worked so hard on. Yeehaw, what fun. My character now means nothing. THAT is the problem.<br />
<br />
<br />
Its for one boss to get into Ulduar ffs, with all the speculation over Naxx being too easy, Blizz needed to change a few things around, putting a more skill based battle into the field has done that. As soon as your raid has past this first boss, your gear is needed...... your gear is needed in the first boss aswell.......try reading and understanding it properly? l2read.<br />
<br />
Everyone QQing over ONE boss just makes me lol tbh. go cry in a cornet somewhere until you understand the reason Blizz has used this mix of skill and abilities 'gauntlet' battle. YOU DO NOT HAVE TO USE A VEHICLE, ITS FOR ONE FIGHT! Not the whole f####ng raid.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Tho it is a game it still requires &quot;skills&quot; when it comes to actually fulfilling the tasks ahead and this is where most people fail to put up a fight.<br />
<br />
All I see is people scared shitless when it comes to doing anything else but press those spells whose rotation they looked up on the internet. This is why one rarely finds people on LFG on Occulus or why people fail to clear content in WOTLK. <br />
<br />
The drake fights are more than challenging but why have something challenging and not just playable? Start using your brains and use those so-called skills you boast about when calling other people &quot;noobs&quot; or whatever the heck you people use as a word and trully achieve something when it comes to actual gaming. That vehicle fight will be more of a BRAINS check rather than gear check and Im pretty sure more than 50% of those trying will fail miserably.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Berzerker</div><div class="date">2009-02-18, 02:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The most obvious difference between Ulduar and its predecessors is that the dungeon actually comprises two separate raid areas. The first section is an epic battle against a vast army standing between you and the entrance of the dungeon proper; in the second area, you will dive into the heart of the dungeon itself and finally discover the secrets of Ulduar.<br />
<br />
Ulduar's new master has rallied his own massive Iron Army to guard the entrance to Ulduar and to prevent any unwanted guests - including you, especially you - from reaching the inner sanctum.<br />
<br />
I'm curious if this is truly two separate &quot;raid areas&quot; to imply instances, or if Voltron is a &quot;world raid boss&quot; a la Doomwalker that is just tromping around outside, shooting down flying mounts and killing people trying to just glide in. At the very least &quot;two separate raid areas&quot; would carry an implication that at some point you may be able to bypass the vehicle portion of it, perhaps like an attunement or somethin akin to the old Scepter of Celebras, where once you reached a point later in the dungeon, you gained the abililty to skip the earlier parts....<br />
<br />
One such threat is the Flame Leviathan. After you've plowed through the innumerable ranks of the Iron Army, you will be confronted by an enormous tank. Mimiron built the Flame Leviathan as part of the V0-L7R-0N weapons platform, which means that it packs quite a punch.<br />
<br />
Meaning there are more parts? I can already imagine the &quot;epic&quot; cutscene on that boss fight... &quot;Too soon!&quot; becomes &quot;I form the head!&quot;<br />

Maybe he'll come out at the end of the Yogg-Saron fight to deal the killing blow... all to reveal that OMG, it was all really a plot by Lotor, who's the REAL final boss :P</div></div><hr />

All that was required for a wipe was 1 person screwing up the ghost, that encounter was based on skill and gear.<br />
Sure all that was req on that fight for those who was turned into ghost was: aoe attack/aoe frezze, spirit lance, tab, spirit lance, tab etc, aoe attack, aoe frezze and repeat, still alot of ppl FAILED miserably on that.<br />
<br />
Why i say gear based? If the fight took to long all dps or healers would die which would resoult in A. tank/raid dies casue to much aoe damg going on and noone to heal them up in time, or B. not enough dps which results in &quot;A&quot; casue to many ppl will die.<br />
<br />
Why i say skill based? If you screw up the ghost part you wiped the raid, GG<br />
<br />
Most likley this first encounter will have an enrage timer as most fights do and will continue to have, so if your not geared enough you wont be able to kill the boss in time.<br />

<br />
I agree that many posts are pure whining (and &quot;I'll leave if blabla&quot; is always stupid to hear) but this doesn't help. Everyone should shut up about other people (yes that includes me) and just post their true opinions and thoughts on the matter.<br />

I'm sorry to wish that we had actual discussions in these forums.<br />

<br />
Wrong.<br />
You can't form a &quot;true&quot; opinion about something you haven't seen/played/experienced. This thread is full of hasty conclusions, not opinions. Some people are so convinced that this is gone to suck, but they have not even had the experience yet. That is a very negative outlook and the worse part is that I feel no matter what blizzard says bitches still bitch.<br />
<br />
Prime example;<br />
Babies - &quot;I spend X amount of time making my character rad, I don't want to ride around in a vehicle and negate all that&quot;<br />
Blizzard - &quot;Don't worry vehicles scale with gear&quot;<br />
Then people shut up about that but just a few posts later someone starts in on achievement sucking.<br />
<br />
For some people this game is just MORE to complain about. And those people need to move on because Blizzard will not make them happy it seems.<br />

<br />
An easier alternative for more casual people -- as evidenced by the lower ilvl loot. If it was meant to be as difficult as 25 mans then it would drop the same ilvl loot (harder content requires better gear to beat). If you want more difficulty you need to join a 25 man guild. Just like if you want to move from dungeons to raids you can't just play with your 4 friends.<br />
<br />
In an ideal world everyone could have whatever sized guild they want with whatever difficulty they want. However, Blizzard is not capable of delivering that. The achievement based difficulty system has destroyed the sense of achievement that killing a hard raid boss used to bring. Having the 25 man raids with similar difficulty to the 25 man raids in TBC while having the 10 mans for people who don't have the skills or time would solve the problem. But you want to play with fewer people yet overcome the same challenges? Tough cookies, you need more people to beat harder content.<br />
<br />
It takes more dedication from more people to run a 25 man guild than 10 man guild. And by dedication I mean the amount of extra effort that must be spent on things like recruitment and leadership, not your personal effort while learning a boss. It also takes a lot more effort to get 25 people to perform flawlessly than 10. I've seen many successful 10 man guilds where all leadership and organizational overhead is handled by one or two people, but I've never seen a 25 man guild manage that.</div></div><hr />

Why can't it be warbears, and heavily armoured dragons, or some other animal type transportation. Because that would take too much imagination? Too bad. They make enough money they could employ people with some new ideas without resorting to gas-guzzling, smoke spewing, motorcycles and planes.<br />
<br />
The planes in WotLK as fp transports were a disappointment to me, and so was the ability to engineer helicoptors, planes and motorcycles. Now with the release of this information, it sure looks to many of us that Blizzard is going down a road with WoW that will definitely make it less and less distinguishable from Starcraft. How many planes were in Baldur's Gate or Champions of Norath, or Morrowind, a bazillion other games we've all played and enjoyed; games that can't even be compared to WoW from a graphics, mechanics, and artistic point of view? None.<br />
<br />
I suspect that many people have already reached the maximum gear level, quest level, rep level and achievement level that they want to in WotLK, and if they only have one character, they're probably wondering what they're going to do until Ulduar comes out. I think it may be a big mistake to think that adding further machinery, and to the first part of the new instance, will keep everyone hanging around waiting in anticipation to jump on a motorcycle in their gemmed and enchanted tier gear. Just my two cents. <br />

If it was meant to be as difficult as 25 mans then it would drop the same ilvl loot (harder content requires better gear to beat). If you want more difficulty you need to join a 25 man guild. Just like if you want to move from dungeons to raids you can't just play with your 4 friends.<br />
-<br />
<br />
Oh Boy are you wrong!<br />
The higher item level is there to reward people for staying in a bigger guild that require more people and require you to devote more of your time.<br />
10-man contents will be harder from time to time, simply because less people can slack, you only got 2 tanks so they need to know what they do, same with healers. If you got 5 dps slacking in a 10-man content it´s possible that the rest can´t make up for it and so on. 10-man raids are there to be accesable to more people so yes it´s more casual for that reason and has nothing to do with the difficutly.</div></div><hr />

Cassius: On this day, we reach back to hallowed antiquity, to bring you a recreation of the second fall of the mighty Carthage!... On the barren plain of Zama, there stood the invincible armies of the barbarian Hannibal. Ferocious mercenaires and warriors from all brute nations, bent on merciless destruction, conquest. Your emperor is pleased to give you the barbarian horde! <br />
[Crowd cheers] <br />
Maximus: [while Cassius continues his introduction] Anyone here been in the army? <br />
[an unknown gladiator responds yes and tells Maximus he served under his command at Vindobona] <br />
Maximus: You can help me. Whatever comes out of these gates, we've got a better chance of survival if we work together. Do you understand? If we stay together we survive. <br />
Cassius: I'm pleased to bring to you the Legionnaires of Scipio Africanus!<br />
<br />
Scipio Africanus had ancient battle tanks, that were pretty cool, that could programed as a vehicle, replace horses with lets say giant wolves, give the tank a hordish look, and voila u have something cool, that could be 2 manned. There's your replacement for your darn motorcycle...<br />

I think if everyone actually read and thought about the people QQing, it's the type of vehicles being employed. <br />

Wrong and wrong. Engineering has been like this since Vanilla, and the Goblin/Gnome lore of the Warcraft IP has been like this for 10+ years. Blizzard has always poked fun at lolmedival fanatics like yourselves, since Warcraft 3 and before. There has always been a random &quot;mechanical&quot; element to Goblins in the Warcraft IP, if you don't like it, go play a different game.</div></div><hr />

To those who complain about action bars? Suck it up and use the normal UI - you want your game to look pretty, or do you want to play effectively? Seriously, shut up about action bars.<br />
<br />
To the people who say vehicles in raids is a stupid idea? Shut the hell up. This is the first raid with vehicles and it will work nothing like Wintergrasp or Strand of the Ancients. Wait and see before you bash it. Again, all you want to do is complain about a game you refuse to quit. Just stop playing already - there's no use in whining when it's already in the game.<br />
<br />
I've PvPed as a Gladiator and now a Flawless Victor. I've raided every instance since the Vanilla WoW. I've done all the world PvP there is to possibly do. I've played countless RPGs, FPS, what have you. In my opinion, this looks to be more fun than anything thus far in WoW. Just my opinion, you're free to your own obviously.<br />

<br />
I mean we've gone from epic fights like Vashj, Kael'thas, and the like with long attunements meant to weed out the pretenders from the players to fighting a recycled level 60 encounter boss in a nerfed zone with seriously overpowered gear, even moreso on 10-man mode. I kid you not, the day I hit 80 I was in 25-man Naxx and killed Kel'thuzad. The end. See you next week.<br />
<br />
Naxx had its day, and at the time it was the hardest zone in the game. Now, it's just plain dated with bosses that are nothing comparable to the best BC had to offer.<br />
<br />
The longest level 80 zone in the game wasn't really 'designed' either because it's already there at level 60, you just took out the more difficult parts of the encounters and slapped new loot in there.<br />
<br />
I mean.... what the hell? Did a -completely- different team design these encounters from those of BC? Was it the Activision merger? Did Activision ham-hand this? What? Surely Jeff Kaplan didn't have a hand in this mess, he did such a great job designing BC.<br />
<br />
WoW is a complete joke now. Holy shit they skimped on the content. At BC's release there was enough content to keep most raiding guilds busy for months. Now, pfft, two weeks after release and we're done killing all the new content, even on 'hard' mode.<br />
<br />
<br />
Blizzard now caters to the player who would rather play his PSP or Xbox than wipe more than 3 times to collect loot on a raid boss. Sorry the game you love is gone and blizzard continually reinforces that point with every statement and new decision they make. <br />
<br />
Killing a raid boss is never going to matter anymore. It's never going to feel epic to kill a raid boss that a trade chat pug just one shot regardless of optionally handicapping yourself and making the encounter harder. Killing a raid boss is no longer any sort of representation of skill, knowledge of your class and game mechanics or dedication. Anyone and everyone, your 11 year old little brother with an extra chromosome who plays a tri spec paladin gemmed for spirit etc. etc. will continue to clear all new content until the game dies.</div></div><hr />

Most likely yes. Blizzard has been ramping up the development of their next MMO. If they're going to put in the massive investment required to bring in a new MMO they're going to make damn sure that their best people are working on it. They're not going to have their best and brightest working on an old title for which millions of people will continue to pay for no matter what they do with it. Every product has a life cycle, WoW has passed its golden era and is now becoming a cash cow that will be milked until the next product is ready.</div></div><hr />

I would say those are all valid arguments. If you hate those things and refuse to change then that is your fault. It's not your GF's fault you don't like her make-up, or the cars fault you don't like it or Obama's fault for being black.<br />
<br />
Nor is it's Blizzards fault you are in the minority and want something they don't want to provide you (hence quitting is a better solution then constantly filling these boards with boo-hoo-boo-hoo).<br />
<br />
Blizzards official motto should be &quot;We don't negotiate with crybabies&quot;.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Durf</div><div class="date">2009-02-20, 06:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Really, guys?... I mean, really?<br />
<br />
The capacity for players lurking in WoW forums never ceases to amaze me. So many players whine when blizzard adds something new and creative to the game, because it's not what they're used to.<br />
<br />
To the person claiming to have downed Kel'Thuzad the day they hit lvl 80: Wow, dude. I'm sure you were a major contributor to that effort. And I'm equally sure everyone else in your 25 man raid did Thadius in the same crappy blues/greens you were wearing. Yeah right, BS.<br />
<br />
World of Warcraft is an evolving game. You cannot demand that all endgame content be extremely difficult. All you can do is expect that difficulty of content be commensurate with target item levels and an increasing gradient based on required level of skill. Karazhan is an easy raid in the right gear, and extremely difficult if your whole raid is under-equipped for the fight.<br />
<br />
Person whining about how marvelously difficult Lady Vasj and Sunwell were, and that there's no truly difficult content in Wrath yet: Consider that you have yet to play Uludar. I forsee many many wipes for you before you are able to clear it just once. And very unlikely you'll pull it off in the first week after release, unless your guild is exceptional. Also, Icecrown Citadel is still far out on the horizon.<br />
<br />
Raid difficulty is supposed to be easy at entry level. Think back to the good old days: UBRS, and then later Molten Core. Did you hear people whining and whining and carrying on about how easy UBRS was? HECK NO! Duh, it's an entry raid. Not meant to be the end all definition of difficulty at endgame. It's there to teach people the basics of raiding. Just freaking common sense. So stop whining about the entry level raids in wrath being easy. Wait for the challenging content. Nobody ever complained about SWP being too easy!<br />
<br />
If you bought WoW this past Christmas, the place you'll be learning to raid is Naxxramas. That will be your first exposure to raiding ever. Duh, it's supposed to be relatively easy. Harder than heroics, but not quite BWL or the classic version of Naxx.<br />
<br />
Uludar is supposed to be a mid-difficulty raid. Think AQ, ZG and ZA. Challenging at first, until geared, but still requiring more skill than the first iteration of raiding (i.e. UBRS or Kara).<br />
<br />
So please pipe down with all the QQ.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Durf</div><div class="date">2009-02-20, 07:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">To the people whining about the vehicles:<br />
<br />
You are the same people who whine about Occulus and Eye of Eternity. Really, these instances require you to expand your ability to raid, forcing you to learn new skills just to enter the standard sections of the instance. A clear annoyance to you who like the classic boring tank and spank fights like Patchwerk which require little real skill and teamwork. Just spam your spell rotation like a good little robot.<br />
<br />
Some of us actually enjoy creative content, and are more than happy to explore content that's a step beyond the cookie-cutter instances we have been playing for more than 4 years.<br />
<br />
If we're gonna have a discussion about Uludar, why not post some positive thoughts? Gear up and get ready. Not all the instance is gonna be in vehicles, and I'm sure that gear you've been farming in Naxx 25 and EE/OS/Vault will be coming in handy.<br />
<br />
Please, guys, please, more pew-pew, less QQ. Ty</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">extsr2001</div><div class="date">2009-02-20, 08:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">One would hope that the content to come is a bit less relax'd. However that being said, Blizzard only looks at the dollar sign and the 10% of the people that play for hardcore raiding, wont out weigh the 90% that want casual and no farming , no brains game. Its horrible to look at it that way, but its the truth.<br />
<br />
And as for the huge expendature of making their next MMO or any project, I have to laugh. I do not really care what anyone else has to offer on this subject, but WOW contributes 25% of the parent companies income annually. They make almost 2 billion a year off this product, if they really have 10M players paying for it. They haven't even gone through the first years release sales and monthly income to cover the costs up to date by my math. That leaves a several Billion in just revenue. Let alone the sales for each expansion have covered their development of each by 3 or 4 fold.<br />
<br />
But its all about the dollars for them, it probably started out as something else in the beginning, but once the corporate structure saw the cash cow mooing, they put a boot up the designers ass and said make it friendly, easy and above all big and pretty. And they did. And now we basically have Hello Kitty 2.0 and 10 Million players shelling out $15 month. 1 Million of us want what it was supposed to be, 9 Million want it even easier, so they can just bind one key to their favorite move and roll their face across the keyboard!</div></div><hr />

What made Occulus and Malygos good was the drake parts, you gear dont mean anything but your skill does. I love this and I hope more and more encounters rely on pure player skill and less gear. Bravo Blizzard please keep it coming with these amazing new raids!</div></div><hr />

11 hard mode bosses<br />
thats 11 bosses x 4 (normal + 3 difficulties levels ((if they follow Sarth's hardmode style)) ) + 3.<br />
Thats theoretically, 47 bosses. Now if the bosses are completely gay like basically all of Naxx, then thats irrelevant but <br />
lets give Blizz the benefit of the doubt here that this content will :<br />
<br />
1. be catered to hopefully the more experienced and skilled players. I know i'm asking for a ton here Blizzard, but I've never been<br />
so mad seeing fail guilds who couldn't kill Leo drop Illidan after that patch when it took us weeks of wiping to do him. And that's<br />
has been the norm since. Guilds that used to be fucking 55th on the server are now top 20, since everyone and their mother and<br />
eligitimate child can raid now. Fix this. Titles and mounts should not be the only thing seperating true raiders from the fails. <br />
<br />
2. be interesting. Vehicles aside (as i'm against them as for now since Malygos is kinda lame imo, yet still the most interesting fight in WotlK thus<br />
far minus Sarth+3D, which isn't saying much). Make the fights unique. Take a look at BC. Take a look at Najentus. Take a look at Requiem, or<br />
Archimonde, Illidan, all of Sunwell. Take those as examples, improve and make them even cooler. We all realize you can only do so much, but<br />
try throwing some new shit into the mix. Rinsing and repeating with a little extra, is still a little extra.<br />
<br />
3. see number 1 again.<br />
4. Make either legendaries from Ulduar, that are stupid hard to get (i'm talking Thunderfury gay back at 60 hard or Atiesh), or bring back class specific<br />
items. The only people who get to enjoy class specific items now are the druids, pallies, and douchebag shaman. IMO Benediction 2.0. Get on it.<br />
<br />
5. Recipe drops again. Nothing is rare anymore. I'm making fuckin 5g a pop on enchants using 500+g of mats. What the hell. I used to make 100g a pop<br />
selling semi-rare recipes for shits sake. Again, see sunwell recipes.<br />
<br />
6. Make the new rarest mount ever be a huge dwarf, that you ride on, with an epic beard of awesomeness. And then, make him fly too. Somehow.<br />
And give him a pet bar. His one move &quot;Fuck off Ashes of Alar&quot; - Your Dwarven Awesome Mount of Dreams farts on A'lar's ashes disentigrating them <br />
into nothingness and making the owner qq for days. IF I CANT GET ONE TO DROP, NO ONE SHOULD DAHAHAHA. jk jk. I r has a raptor :)<br />
<br />
That is all.</div></div><hr />

Really? I guess Vashj and Kael were 'entry level' just like Naxx is now? Please, you're comparing apples to oranges here. Vashj was incredibly hard, almost impossible for months after BC's release.<br />
<br />
You are completely missing the point and are comparing WoW when it was just starting out to today's WoW after years of maturity.<br />
<br />
Need I Remind you that Vashj was Bugged for several months after launch of BC. I remember reading it constantly that Nihilum was working closely with Blizzard to isolate and fix the problem.<br />
<br />
Also in Durf's post, he never mentioned SSC &amp; TK:Eye as entry level, he refered to Kara as entry level.<br />
<br />
<br />
That being said, what I notice alot of people missing is that the Vehicals in Ulduar scale with your characters gear, thus meaning your actual results in the game may vary and it can change the difficulty of the Flame Leviathan fight.<br />
<br />
For all the people that are complaining about the currently difficulty of the game fine, I to agree that the game has lost alot of its raiding difficulty since Pre-BC. I still remember it being an amazing feat to be able to down Ragnaros within 1 minute and 30 seconds before the 'Sons' spawn. That used to be saying something. But People need to look at Naxx, as Durf said, the new UBRS/Kara for Wrath.<br />
<br />
It's designed to get people interested.<br />
It's designed to teach people the basic fundimentals of raiding.<br />
<br />
What is skewed for some people is the name of the raiding. 10 man being called Normal, and 25 man being called Heroic, when really now, there isn't too much of a difference (from a consistant raiders perspective). I can say, with a degree of certainty that majority of the people in this thread who are complaining about difficulty are the same people who have yet to do Sartharion + 3 Drakes Up. That takes much more co-ordination than anything else.<br />
<br />
Also, like someone said before this is really only a business model Blizzard is following now, they are trying to get more people interested. This is because unless you are raiding/pvping/alt leveling, this game itself does not have alot of retention once you hit the maximum level.<br />
<br />
But by making everything that much more accessable, you are not relying on new signups now and customer turnover. You have created a retentative base of clients that will stay much longer than before.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I do not like every boss in Naxx.<br />
But I refuse to complain since there are a lot of fights I love.<br />
I love to sit on dragons and kill Malygos.<br />
<br />
You cannot have everything the way you want it.<br />
Now stop being so egocentric and understand WHY blizzard does it: It is new and offers a nice challenge.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cicero</div><div class="date">2009-02-25, 05:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">At this point, I'll go ahead and give Blizzard the benefit of a doubt. If you step back and look at things in WotLK, really what they've left out of the game at release by comparison to Burning Crusade's release is just an additional set of tier gear and its associated bosses.<br />
<br />
At BC's release, you had 2 sets of new tier gear (T4 from Karazhan, Gruul, and Magtheridon, T5 from SSC and TK) available, whereas right now we only have 1 new set of tier gear available (T7 from Naxx and Sartharion). Ulduar will be tier 8, it's just going to be several months after release that it will be available.</div></div><hr />

You are the same people who whine about Occulus <br />
<br />
Every sane person will whine about Occulus, the fact that there are 4 achievements to get there for Glory of the Hero just prove that Blizzard had to come up with some reason for people to go there again after the first horrible experiemce.</div></div><hr />
