Considering the Q&amp;As have always occurred on a Thursday in the past, this one being on a Tuesday means it is aligning with something, which could very well be pre-order announcement.<br />

Not saying you're wrong, but if they cared so much couldn't they just move the pre-order announcement to Thursday?</div></div><hr />

Contrary to that. It makes it MORE likely it's coming Tuesday with preorders. It's part of the marketing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hmm..come to think of it..was there ever a mount that was awesome? I remember the Classic CE for the cool pets...and yeah...I personally shell out the extra 30 Euros for the CE because it looks kinda nice on the shelf and also has the behind the scene DvD...and especially the art book...stuff like that.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Evolutious</div><div class="date">2018-01-25, 08:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">not if it is day of, because they would then need to patch in the mounts and allied races on a thrusday<br />
<br />
Keep in mind that allied races, their associated mounts and all that is required in game to play them is already in the live client; it came with 7.3.5. The only missing piece is the pre-order requirement being met to allow you to be able to play those races. <br />
<br />
Also, not to toss out conspiracy theories, but Tuesday, Jan 30, is also the day that a well known competing MMO is releasing their next major patch. Providing a way to keep the WoW player based focused on WoW, by having them spends days on leveling allied races, is certainly a viable marketing strat as well.</div></div><hr />

I saw this, and instantly went &quot;Hey, remember the Fairy dragon/ Iron Skyreaver/ Grinning Reaver mounts that were clearly reputation mounts that Blizzard decided to put on the store instead of the actual factions they were clearly designed for?&quot;<br />
<br />
Because that's what these remind me of. Mounts clearly designed for the Kul-tiras and Zandalar factions, taken from the faction they were clearly designed for and replaced with most likely absolute bupkis, much like how the Legion factions had absolute bupkis for hitting exalted.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I saw this, and instantly went &quot;Hey, remember the Fairy dragon/ Iron Skyreaver/ Grinning Reaver mounts that were clearly reputation mounts that Blizzard decided to put on the store instead of the actual factions they were clearly designed for?&quot;<br />
<br />
Because that's what these remind me of. Mounts clearly designed for the Kul-tiras and Zandalar factions, taken from the faction they were clearly designed for and replaced with most likely absolute bupkis, much like how the Legion factions had absolute bupkis for hitting exalted.<br />
<br />
Sorry, the rest of us might not have access to the same Crystal Ball that you have which is letting you know for sure that there won't be any other dino or horse mounts or faction mounts in BfA.<br />

yes, the pre-order comes with the mounts, and level boost.</div></div><hr />

I see peopel on the pvp ones, thats it though. I have nothing against horses if it looks cool.</div></div><hr />

I remember the Classic CE for the cool pets...and yeah...I personally shell out the extra 30 Euros for the CE because it looks kinda nice on the shelf and also has the behind the scene DvD...and especially the art book...stuff like that.<br />
<br />
Yeah I got the mounts for the MoP and WoD collectors and they're pretty cool. I keep meaning to get the physical CE because the art book and extras look neat, but usually when its go-time I don't wanna let go of the extra cash and just go with the virtual one. I bet the CE art book for legion was cool though. I love the old ruins around Azuna and everything.<br />

&quot;Ravasaur&quot;, isn't that like a Devilsaur rather than a raptor...?<br />
<br />
Although I imagine that'd make the Alliance crying even bigger, if Horde got a Devilsaur-type mount whilst they got another horse.<br />
<br />
They may want to make a Devilsaur mount something more availible ingame so more people have a shot at it. They could do dif colors or styles of a ravasaur or a horse and make something special but not something too exclusive. My guess anyway</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't think they could have summed up the ratio of effort spent on the two factions better if they tried.</div></div><hr />

<br />
because you can fly right now<br />
cant in BFA<br />
because new mogs and themes are based NOTHING near horses<br />
the new expansion is very much based near horses<br />
also does everything have to be made for a million people to ride?<br />
i know atleast 50 rpers SUPER happy for a few new cool horse models!<br />

i wouldent call it golden and guilded, also you act as if DINOSAUR SO UNIQUE when the game has like 40 dinosaur mounts now.<br />
its a raptor that will have abit of zandalari stuff on its, its not a MEGA SUPER ULTRA GOLDEN MEGA TREX!!!!<br />

<br />
its just a raptor with the zandalari stuff on it, not &quot;gold plated&quot; <br />
like this but a raptor, also different armor, yes its going to have gold, but its not literally like BLING BLING RAPTOR<br />

Even if that was true (which looks unlikely), I am pretty sure Alliance would be lining up the door to swap in a heartbeat given the chance. No matter how you try to spin it, its a frigging dinosaur vs a horse!</div></div><hr />
