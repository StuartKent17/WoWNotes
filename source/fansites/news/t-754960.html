Streaming Launcher Improvements<br />
We recently released a new Cataclysm beta launcher that allows you to stream game data while you play. We've received a lot of feedback from you regarding this new feature, and that feedback has allowed us to improve the player experience significantly.<br />
<br />
In the next beta patch, you'll receive a new Cataclysm beta launcher that includes several updates to in-game streaming. Here's a quick preview of some of the upcoming changes:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Improved three-stage progress bar<br />
Download speed improvements<br />
Detailed peer-to-peer connection information<br />
Bandwidth detection, which will improve the play experience of those with low bandwidth<br />
New UI with a Cataclysm-inspired theme<br />
Many bug fixes<br />
<br />
<br />
We encourage you to continue posting your feedback about the streaming launcher, as we're constantly looking for ways to get you into the game faster and more smoothly.<br />
<br />
Thank you! <br />

Dungeons testing<br />
All dungeons should be available for testing. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26560771383/feedback-uldum/))<br />

[Feedback] Twilight Highlands<br />
Twilight Highlands is ready for testing. It is not yet fully implemented, so you will run into stopping points. Please keep all feedback in this thread.<br />
<br />
• Level 84-85 (though for this push of the beta minimum level for quests has been set to 83. Enjoy getting pounded!)<br />
• Breadcrumbs from Stormwind and Orgrimmar (speak to Varian/Garrosh to begin) (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26560771384/feedback-twilight-highlands/))<br />

Attacks Scaling<br />
Most of these attack still scale from weapon damage. We just changed them from say 200% weapon damage to 100% weapon damage with a higher attack power component. We want weapon damage to matter, but not quite as much as it does on live.<br />
<br />
As an example, Chimera Shot now says: &quot;An instant shot that causes weapon damage plus N, refreshing your Serpent Sting and triggering an effect depending on the venom on the target...&quot;. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26560841361/hunter-s-build-12857-removiing-weapon-dmg/))<br />

Seal of Insight<br />
Seal of Insight will improve your mana regen and self healing. It will give you a little of each if you only Judge and give you more (but not a broken amount) if you're ever in a position where you can melee the target. There is also a glyph to improve your healing while Insight is active. I'll concede that running a Seal is probably more important for a Ret or perhaps even Prot paladin than a Holy paladin, but there's still no reason not to do so. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26560568391/lack-of-seal-for-holy-pally/))<br />
<br />
Seal of Justice / Righteousness<br />
Seal of Righteousness and Seal of Justice didn't merge. Seal of Righteousness is unchanged. We just added a little damage to Seal of Justice so that paladins didn't have to give up all Seal damage (and talents etc. that affect them) in order to get the Justice effect. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26560570779/ret-build-12857/))<br />
<br />
Selfless Healer change<br />
We buffed it to 50/100% more healing when used on others (up from 30/60%). These numbers are unlikely to be final. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26560570779/ret-build-12857/))<br />

New Life Tap<br />
Life Tap scaling with spellpower was proving hard to balance. We buffed Drain Life as well, so you should be able to Life Tap once and then Drain Life your way back up. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26560570770/ouch-lifetap-change/))</div></div><hr />

Guess all we can really do is wait and see.<br />

New Launcher looks even better than the Screenshot btw :)<br />

The Rivendare Deathcharger is still there after all this time and I think if anything that proves they're willing to keep old mounts if they have low drop rates. The only reason they removed the Amani War Bear was because it was a guaranteed drop, and the same treatment will probably happen to things like Mimiron's Head in the future.<br />
<br />
I think what they should do is retune all of the old Zandalar rep items to low-level equivalents and make the Tiger and Raptor rewards for Exalted. But that's just my 2 cents. Give a little reward to those who spent all of their time farming the mounts.<br />
<br />
I myself managed to get to 15k/21k Revered just off the two mount bosses and whatever trash I may have pulled by accident while fighting. Hell I think I wasted more time farming those bosses than getting the Winterspring Frostsaber mount.</div></div><hr />

it will turn daily solo and im sure most classes will solo it in a few month later after cata hits.<br />
<br />
I think he means because it would be daily farming, but I do not agree. Look at baron's mount.<br />
Actually zulian tiger (same as amani war bear) is very unique.For example if you a horde player hard to notice barons mounts from undead mounts or raptor mount from troll mounts.For alliances both mounts valuable. But zulian tiger can notice easly as horde or alliance.<br />
<br />
my point is ; unique mounts are attracts people not they seem like.For example Ashes of Al'ar i test a few times and worst tail animation ever.You cant see anything in front of you if camera behind view.Or look at Celestial Steed it can be best mount ever if its a rare drop.But now no one using.</div></div><hr />

What can I say it's random, random doesn't mean you get it because you farm each reset. I know someone who farmed it's since it was humanly possible still no luck. I got after about a month + so you see it's RANDOM. If we pretend it's a 1% drop rate that's still a lot of months of farming (in theory). Everybody talks about Barons mount being 1%, I have killed it 225 times and no mount, no exactly 1% for me eh :P<br />

Still, if Blizzard is going to allow us to be able to get the Uld/ToC/ICC raid achievement mounts in the expansion, I don't see why they would remove the ZG mounts. They'll probably just put a 5-man version of ZG in the zone with the mounts on the loot table...hopefully...</div></div><hr />

Enough time to get them? No time is ever enough with the horrible RNG some people suffer.<br />
<br />
I've not ONCE seen either drop. Same with Rivendare's mount. And the Blue Proto from UP. And the mount from Kara.<br />
<br />
That annoys the crap out of me, considering I'm a mount collector. Only mount I ever got from an instance is the Brewfest Ram. And that's only because no one in the group wanted it!</div></div><hr />

If X is 300 then X+200 nerfed to X+150 is still a nerf.<br />
If X is 500 then X+200 nerfed to X+150 is still a nerf.<br />

You can't &quot;nerf&quot; something in beta. They're playing with numbers. Today it's +50%, tomorrow it's +150%, next week they make it +100%. They're trying to figure out where the sweet spot is and how to to make things balance. Last week it was too high, next week it might be too low and they'll stick it in between two weeks from now.</div></div><hr />

Rogues can barely do it on the raptor boss, and soloing him requires the rogue to go out of the way by getting Lifeward enchants on both weapons, using a lot of buffs (food, potions, etc.) and tanking trinkets (Corroded Skeleton Key).<br />

Kind of sucks bringing someone else along in that sense since it would only be fair then to let them roll on the mounts too.</div></div><hr />

Wouldn't it be real nice if they just let us buy the mounts for being exalted with the Zandalar tribe?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I never understood the reasoning behind having to be in a raid group to enter raids. It serves no practical purpose as far as I can tell, since you can't solo trash or bosses in current raids (Not counting the occasional creative one who manages to solo something like Flame Leviathan or Patchwork) and the only thing of value you could get from soloing old raids are gold, items for flavor (Either a cool effect or model), outdated recipes for the person who absolutely needs every recipe, or pets/mounts.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Although I'm sure the QQing about the mounts going away (if they do) will be heard across the solar system. One of my guildies was already whining about the possibility.<br />
<br />
Anyone looking to try for the mounts, remember, the raid lockout is only 3 days, so you can try more than once per week. GL! ;)</div></div><hr />

Because they don't already...? Except for the ones that rolled the wrong class and it's a pain in the ass for them to solo it, that is. Having a tiger doesn't make you a unique snowflake.</div></div><hr />

Oh no! You won't be &quot;Special&quot; anymore since it would be even more common. HA!<br />
If you want to be &quot;Special&quot; then go after the Phoenix mount or Time-Lost. I've only seen them once while every damn person has the ZG mounts.<br />
<br />
<br />
Personally i don't care about the mounts (don't have them and don't care about them) but i want to know what will happen to all of the bijous, Zandalar rep and quests.</div></div><hr />

If X is 500 then X+200 nerfed to X+150 is still a nerf.<br />
If X is 100 then X+200 nerfed to X+150 is still a nerf.<br />
<br />
It doesn't matter when X is. When numbers go down you do less dps.<br />
<br />
That isn't the case with hunters though. Can you say that X+200 changed to X*Y+150 is still a nerf without knowing more than &quot;Y&gt;1.0&quot;?<br />
<br />
That's the problem. You can't just take the reduction of weapon damage contribution to an ability by itself and claim nerf. Not when the attack power contribution is going up in response. I suspect that hunter change is specifically meant to change it so that the hunter's weapon isn't such a huge part of that ability's damage. That means you can get the ability to scale better off of more agility than you could before. And that means armor pieces can contribute a larger portion of DPS than normal.<br />
<br />
Bears currently have similar threat scaling issues. So much AP comes from the weapon that the weapon being upgraded is the single largest way to improve druid threat. On the order of being barely able to hold threat with a 245 weapon in ICC, to getting a 264 weapon and your DPS/threat jump 20%.</div></div><hr />

TBH, what a close friend and I are doing, is she brings her hunter*her main*, while i bring my crappy *Uld* geared DK tank *my alt*, we snake around doing the raptor, tiger and summonable fish boss *for the Polymorph Tome: Turtle*....if any of the mounts drop while she's on her hunter, she gets them automatically. Than we switch. She hops on her DK tank, I hop on my mage, and we do it again, if the mounts drop on that run, they are automatically mine :D that way we're not fighting on rolls. Something to think about<br />
