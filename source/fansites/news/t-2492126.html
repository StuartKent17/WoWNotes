I could be wrong but imo if they were releasing it the 25th they would have had an announcement already. My bet is the 8th of july because they wont release it during the 4th of july week. Works for me gives me time to try out ffxiv's new expansion before I decide whether or not to come back for 8.2.</div></div><hr />

except you will have water walking equipment in your mail...<br />
that will allow you to give the mount and all other mounts water walking...<br />

<br />
they announced 7.2's release date only 5 days before it went live<br />
7.3 was only 6 days<br />
<br />
so nah, it still may be the 25th.<br />

the 8th of july is way too late.</div></div><hr />

Not even close to the point. The water striders had exactly one thing going for them, one rare and very useful quality that made them worth working to get: built-in water walking. Now, that's going away, that special characteristic. Now they'll be indistinguishable from any other mount, and all because people have been too damned lazy to either swap mounts as needed, or to use elixirs, etc. to gain water walking on the mount of their choice. <br />
<br />
That out of the way, what's the chance of 8.2 arriving as early as the 18th?</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is exactly why they will launch the patch the week of the 25th. Blizzard LOVES to push updates the same time their competition releases them. They will want to fight the FFXIV Shadowbringers early access with an 8.2 launch.<br />
<br />
Otherwise they're looking at July 2nd which is a no-go because you wouldn't have much staff around that week to fix any potential issues. Waiting until the 8th gives FFXIV too much time to get attention.<br />
<br />
It's totally going to be the 25th.</div></div><hr />

So? Then don't get them, if looks mean nothing to you. They look different, so they are still distinguishable from other mounts.<br />
And don't worry; you can attach the water walking item to all your mounts but still keep changing to the old water walking mounts whenever you want to run over a patch of water. Enjoy &lt;3</div></div><hr />

Yes, and then you will be back again in about a months time whining for more content. There are more pets and mounts in this patch, than actual content. Might want to pace yourself this time around.</div></div><hr />

Better than seeing 50% of players using only the water strider at all times. It killed mount variety in the world. This fixes that. I don't like seeing water-striders everywhere, I like mounts being more cosmetic.</div></div><hr />

QFT. I don't think i'll renew my sub even for the summer and most likely won't come back after summer because I won't have a raid spot anymore and I'll be too far behind to catch up.<br />

I think he meant that in order to restore the strider to what it was, it must use up an entire mount equipment slot that could otherwise be used for something else.

Not always the case, if you read the first page it is mentioned that they announced 7.2, 5 days before it went live and 7.3, 6 days before it went live..</div></div><hr />

Yea but they were churning out content in legion. Here they are taking their sweet time doubling the gaps between content drops almost. I have a strong suspicion we wont get 8.2 till the week of july 8th because of how long its taken.</div></div><hr />

<br />
While this is very true they did announce a date for end of season 1....it is assumption at this point but pvp has always been on a 25 week cycle for seasons...that would put 8.2 july 16th...i for one hope its sooner but not getting hopes up at this point...</div></div><hr />

Again, once you are done with this content in a month or so you will be back complaining for more content. Blizzard has conditioned many in this player base to need an endless and constant stream of content to keep them satisfied and content. I am not sure how many of these types of people will be able to handle playing Classic WoW in the coming months. God forbid they will forever have to play the exact same content over and over again until their eyes bleed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You only put the ability in the slot on your mount select page and it applies for all your mounts until it is replaced, but who is going to replace it? At least that's how it worked in beta. If you have a water strider you get mailed the water-walking glyph in the mail so you don't have to buy/make one. Unless something changes between now and launch.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So by this logic, even the Sky Golem should not be the only mount that is capable of herb farming as well. The Striders have and had but one purpose, the fact that the lazy people refused to farm out the necessary rep or coins to get one of them speaks volumes about the player base in this game. I use the Strider to cross water ways, then switch back to to a ground mount on dry land, if I am flying then I am literally using neither to cross land or water. So by this same logic, any and all mounts that can be used for flying also can have the same claims strapped to them in saying flying mounts killed any variety with the use of ground mounts. By the way, I see far more Sky Golem running around than I do Striders in the world, so your post literally does not hold water, pundit intended.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would have thought the 25th/26th would be when it gets released, but that conflicts with the Midsummer holiday and apparently, they never release a patch midway through a holiday, making the 18th/19th again more likely.<br />
<br />
The 2nd/3rd is when FFXIV expansion gets released, what better way to keep players from jumping games by releasing the patch when the expasion gets released, although this is very close to the 4th July. If something goes tits up in the game, noones gonna be around to deal with it during the week.<br />

yeah... BFD was great<br /> 
but sadly CoS was too short (which is fine if....) it was also too hard for the items it gave. its only a few ilvl over BoD while being harder then the hardest boss in BFA.<br />
so CoS really wasnt worth doing more then once...<br />
BFD needed to end about a month and a half a month ago, if CoS had more ilvl, or was easier it would be fine but its not so.</div></div><hr />

They're expanding the number of slots that you can hide. You'll be able to hide all slots except the pants. (Which is really odd considering players can just unequip their gear or use a toy like Moroes' Famous Polish to show their undies.)<br />

All of a sudden we see that we can select the beta/stress test client ONLY to know that it's because it will make it easier to uninstall. Well... it actually made me want to uninstall it just by knowing I can't still play it, that's for sure xD<br />

Log into the ptr - the new zones are stuning and beatiful. The view is so crazy good.<br />

Lol, WoW isn't even close to dead. So many MMO's would kill to be as &quot;dead&quot; as WoW is now. Even if you took the current playerbase and reduced it by 90% WoW would still be a relatively successful game. It's quite a bit smaller than it used to be, but nothing blizzard did could have maintained Wotlk levels of popularity indefinitely, that's not how games work. Even with updates, you can't keep the popularity growing forever.</div></div><hr />

Hellfire citadel was released a day before heavensward (first ffxiv expansion), it was a patch that did not have a date set for a long time. Heavensward announced its release date way ahead of time. This was in june 2015.<br />
<br />
Stormblood (second ffxiv expansion) was released a week after the patch where tomb of sargeras opened. Stormblood had announced its date at least half a year ahead of time. It was fairly annoying to try to play both.<br />
<br />
Now it's the same thing again. It has happened with major patches too. As a fan of both games i havent had the need to smoke anything to see the pattern.</div></div><hr />

that will allow you to give the mount and all other mounts water walking...<br />
<br />
Except that is still a nerf because it is taking away a mount equipment slot from something that I may otherwise desire. Water-walking without depending on potions is just too worthwhile in comparison to other equipment. The engineer-crafted mount that lets your character collect an herb node without dismounting specifically had an exception carved out for it - it can still be used to collect herbs but whatever you have slotted as your mount equipment will not stack on top of that ability - so why could the water-strider not have the same type of exception? It just seems spiteful to me.<br />
<br />
<br />
whats this about loosening Tmog rules?<br />
<br />
I don't seem to remember it.<br />

Also people seem to be forgetting...<br />

WE CAN FLY IN THIS PATCH.<br />
<br />
F. L. Y.<br />
<br />
Blizzard has updated the transmogrification system with this coming patch to allow characters to hide all equipment slots except for legs. (I theoretically understand the reasoning for the exception, but in practice I am really disappointed because this still means that the dresses with the leg cut-outs in the sides will have the equipped leggings showing through.)<br />
<br />
Also, not all my toons have flying at this point. I really should find time at some point to level my baby Zandalari.<br />
<br />
<br />
Better than seeing 50% of players using only the water strider at all times. It killed mount variety in the world. This fixes that. I don't like seeing water-striders everywhere, I like mounts being more cosmetic.<br />
<br /> 
I like my water-strider. It is cute and I worked for it! You know what actually kills mount variety in my opinion? Not being able to fly. Nearly all flying mounts are ugly to use for strictly running on the ground, from my viewpoint. I understand your perspective; I have sometimes felt that way too. Do you see it from mine, though? I feel like I am being punished for both enjoying the water-strider and its (mostly) unique ability to go across water. Now, I feel that I am going to be forced to choose between a very powerful utility and something that I would otherwise choose... Blizzard has been keeping a bit mum as far as the mount equipment is concerned, but I could have missed something in the news or notes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's the point. The water walking equipment would be useless if people could just use their water walking mounts for water walking. That's exactly what Blizzard wanted to get away from.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">reacher</div><div class="date">2019-06-16, 12:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You only put the ability in the slot on your mount select page and it applies for all your mounts until it is replaced, but who is going to replace it? At least that's how it worked in beta. If you have a water strider you get mailed the water-walking glyph in the mail so you don't have to buy/make one. Unless something changes between now and launch.<br />
<br />
I just think it would have made more sense for the Striders to keep their natural water-walking and then the mount slot could get some other type of bonus on top of the water walking. It's not inherently unfair for this mount to get another ability stacked because I put in the time to grind Anglers rep. All this change is doing is trivializing the water mount model itself</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. Then people would still only use the water strider cause it would still be better then all other mounts.<br />
<br />
2. Lol what? You get free water walking mount equipment. While everyone else has to pay thousands of gold for theirs. <br />
<br />
Also the water striders have not been hard to get since the launch of mop, you are not special for having it.</div></div><hr />

It is more than spiteful. Mount Equipment starts at level 100. That means for the first 60 levels you have no waterwalking. After lvl 60 it doesn't matter because you can fly but they actually cucked leveling even more.</div></div><hr />
