Artcraft - Level Design Part 2<br />
Welcome back to our ongoing Artcraft series that takes a look at the environmental and zone design for World of Warcraft. I’m senior art director Chris Robinson, and today senior level designer Michael McInerney is going to take us through a more high-level design overview, again using Nagrand from Warlords of Draenor to illustrate our level-design philosophies.<br />
<br />
Hello, I’m Michael, and I’ll be providing insights on some of the thought processes that go into designing an iconic zone like Nagrand. Our approach to level design begins with asking many questions, and defining the answers. The one big question we always ask ourselves is “what is the story we are trying to tell?” This usually keys off the initial pitch—in the case of Nagrand, we wanted to convey that this was the sweeping pastoral home of the Warsong clan. But we also needed to determine the specifics of how we were going to communicate that visually to the player.<br />
<br />
The obvious answer to how we tell their story is to put their homes within the environment. But that’s not the only thing that makes a place a home. The Warsong are fairly aggressive and confident, so when you first enter the zone, you’re not so warmly greeted by their war banners and fortified towers. We also knew the Warsong clan were wolfriders and traveled in large packs. This was something we could show with the large beaten-down roads that their war bands travel along. Their home base is nestled into a wind-carved canyon, and has subtle references to an Orgrimmar long past, with buildings and living spaces shaded by cliff sides. We also knew that the way they care for their wolves says something about their culture, and is noticeably different from the reverence for them within the Frostwolf clan. We illustrated that by using animal pits to get across their relationship with their wolves, instead of integrating them into the villages as the Frostwolf would. All of these elements come together to paint a different picture of the Warsong and give them character.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Nagrand also had some equity we wanted to explore; players have experienced a shattered version of the zone in Outland, and this was a unique opportunity to provide a contrasting look. Giving places a sense of history is high on the list of zone design philosophies. Some of the more obvious ways to tell a zone’s history are with ruins, when they make sense. The Highmaul ogres were once a great power in Nagrand. Now they are on the edge of oblivion. All that’s left of their once great civilization is scattered remnants, as evidenced by their crumbling towers and roads you find throughout the zone. It’s not a coincidence that the area they occupy in the zone doesn’t exist in Outland.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2014/october/thumb/ArcraftD203.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2014/october/ArcraftD203.jpg) http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2014/october/thumb/ArcraftD204.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2014/october/ArcraftD204.jpg) <br />
<br />
We also wanted to touch on the floating islands, one of the classic visuals of Nagrand everyone remembers. We needed to figure out how could we could capture that vibe and still tell a story. One way was to create geography so delicate in places you could imagine it snapping off and floating into the sky—fel energies notwithstanding. The sweeping arches and impossible rock formations also lean toward that realm of magic, without fully committing.<br />
<br />
The player experience, and the way a player feels when they are moving through the environments is something we’re always thinking about. Moving from zone to zone, or even within the subzones and small microcosms we create, can dramatically impact someone’s perception of their progression and the game world around them. Stay too long in one area and it can get very tiresome, but move too quickly from one to another and it can feel overwhelming. We work very closely with the quest designers to move players through the world so they can experience a dramatic environmental change at the best possible points, or when we feel they could enjoy a change of scenery.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2014/october/thumb/ArcraftD205.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2014/october/ArcraftD205.jpg) http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2014/october/thumb/ArcraftD206.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2014/october/ArcraftD206.jpg) <br />
<br />
The challenge with Nagrand was creating enough variety within a theme while maintaining an organic feel. This is a zone that is essentially grassland, but we knew we couldn’t fill a space this large with only fields. Developing an ecology that feels fresh and real is an important tenet of designing a world. Mountains flow into valleys; the edges of a forest blend naturally into open fields. The high points are dryer with scrub bushes and dead trees. The low points are lush, sometimes flooded with water. The riverbanks are a subzone in themselves, covered in reeds and thick vegetation. These areas all offer variety yet stay within the fantasy we are trying to deliver.<br />
The way the NPCs occupy the areas should also make sense. The panther-like Saberon live in roughed out caves below the rock arches. Herds of Clefthooves roam the fields. The Highmaul for the most part occupy the mountainous areas. These relationships to the environment tell a story without any reading required.<br />
<br />

<br />
A great zone is one that, upon entering, you immediately “get” the fantasy of, and years later you still remember that moment, and I hope we’ve achieved that with the latest incarnation of Nagrand.<br />
<br />
Tomorrow, senior level designer Ely Cannon will explain more about the role of level designers in the creation of a zone.<br />

Anti-Exploit / Grinding Mechanic<br />
Players in beta first noticed a mechanic that cut XP by 90% after killing the same mobs in the same area for a long time. However, when this mechanic went live, it seems that it activated much more quickly, which has upset some players (http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/1613924-Anti-grinding-mechanic-has-now-been-added-in-%28AOE-farming-no-longer-possible%29). However, the mechanic is being disabled until it is fixed!<br />
This isn't intended to be an &quot;anti-grind&quot; mechanic. It's intended to be an &quot;anti-exploit&quot; mechanic that programmatically addresses power-leveling abuses, with the aim of letting us reward legitimate players more generously. In the past, we've often had little choice but to drastically reduce the experience awarded by certain respawning bosses or enemies that are locked in combat with other NPCs, because otherwise they'd be abused. That always felt bad to the regular player who was just passing through in the course of questing or exploration and got unexpectedly little or no experience for killing something. The goal was to come up with an approach that would be invisible to most players, but discourage sitting there and repeatedly farming the same mob for long stretches of time in order to gain experience. Alternatives like questing, dungeons, or PvP are all supposed to be more lucrative than that - WoW has never been a game in which mass-killing mobs for experience was the most efficient route.<br />
<br />
That said, clearly this implementation is far too strict, and is triggering from a wide variety of normal activity. We're going to disable the functionality entirely and look into a much more narrowly targeted approach if and when we reintroduce it. Apologies for the inconvenience and the lack of response on the issue - we were working on understanding exactly where the algorithm was going awry, and now that we've done so, we'll be taking action in the near future.<br />

Season 15 Arena Rewards<br />
As I mentioned previously, we're working to &quot;scrub&quot; the Arena and RBG ladders to disqualify cheaters. Our original plan was to hand out the end of season rewards with today's maintenance. However, as work to clean up the ladders continues, it's become apparent that we will not have them ready today.<br />
<br />
Our revised plan is to release them next week at the latest, but we're hoping to be able to award them sooner than that. We sincerely apologize for the delay in getting these rewards out to those who earned them legitimately. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/346932-season-15-arena-rewards/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/15007261283?page=1#1))<br />
<br />
Recent Honor Changes<br />
There's been a number of hotfixes around Battleground Honor gains and got clarification on how it's supposed to work.<br />
<br />
At the beginning of Patch 6.0.2 there was no bonus Honor. We implemented a hotfix to grant 135 Honor for a win but mistakenly added it for all Battleground wins instead of only when queuing for a Random Battleground.<br />
<br />
In patch 6.0.3, this was corrected and the bonus Honor is now only awarded for a win when queuing for a Random Battleground. Additionally, we restored the 45 Honor bonus for losing when queued for a Random Battleground.<br />
<br />
If you want your bonus Honor, queue for Random Battlegrounds. <br />
<br />
Honor gains for specific queues are still half of what they were in 5.4.8. So basically still a stealth nerf to push everyone into randoms only. Thanks for the clarification now, but the fact that it was reduced so much, and then broken, and then hotfixed--zero of which were communicated or documented in patch notes--is embarrassing.<br />
In 5.4.8 there was a 135 Honor bonus for the first win of the day in addition to the standard 135 Honor bonus for winning a Random Battleground.<br />
<br />
There is no bonus for the first win of the day in 6.0.2.<br />
<br />
So my partner just completed a WSG random que and won. He had 25hks with 3kbs and only received 50pts. How is this getting 135pts for a random win? <br />
The bonus Honor isn't displayed in the scoreboard at the end of the match. The correct amount should still be awarded. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/346992-whats-going-on-with-honor/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/15007161403?page=2#29))<br />
<br />
Colorblind Shaders 6.0.2<br />
Thanks for posting! To give some background, the system that the colorblind cvar commands relied upon saw a major overhaul in 6.0.2. The colorblind cvar subsystem—which was a set of debug commands to simulate colorblindness for our testing purposes—was thereby rendered nonfunctional. We’re currently working on a more robust and fully featured colorblind shader system to correct for colorblindness. However, that work is still ongoing, and it will be in a patch sometime after the release of Warlords of Draenor.<br />
<br />
In the short term, we've reimplemented the colorblind cvar commands in a beta build that should see the beta test realm soon, and which we expect to be patched into the live game before the release of the expansion. The command has changed to “colorblindSimulator”, but all other settings numbers remain unchanged. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/346971-colorblind-shaders-602/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/14882548731?page=1#2))<br />
<br />
Mythic Lockouts<br />
I've seen some confusion over Mythic raiding lately and wanted to clarify.<br />
<br />
Mythic difficulty's lockout works differently than the other raiding difficulties (Raid Finder, Normal, Heroic). <br />
<br />
In Mythic difficulty, you are bound to the raid ID. This means if you join a Mythic raid, defeat the first boss (thereby binding you to that Mythic raid ID) and leave; you'll return to the same raid. If the raid continues on to defeat bosses 2, and 3 while you were gone, you will return to the raid with those bosses already defeated. <br />
<br />
For that reason, it is important to stick together with the same group of people as much as possible for Mythic difficulty.<br />
<br />
When joining a Mythic raid that's already in-progress, read the notification box that pops up carefully. It'll let you know how many bosses have already been defeated and ask for confirmation to be saved to that raid. If something's not adding up, you can refuse to be saved and be teleported out without being saved. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/346854-question-about-mythic/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/15006681183?page=1#3))<br />

Garrosh'ar Landing I'm assuming? And he's also had some minor sha encounters too probably right?<br />
Yes, the Shado-Pan have kept Sha imprisoned at the monastery for centuries, so they're familiar w/ it. (_DonAdams (https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/525710863328890881))<br />

You're still going to get NA server latency 99% of the time in arenas, bgs, and basically any other form of instance where you are grouped with people on NA servers.<br />
<br />
I know it's exciting having these new servers (I'm excited myself), but most of the time in any meaningful situation (rated arenas etc) you're going to have the same latency as before.<br />

Just how fucking out of touch with their own game can they be? Frost mage aoe leveling was THE way to lvl mage in vanilla, tbc and wrath.<br />
<br />
In vanilla when leveling a paladin you either quested and killed a mob at a time and had to eat and drink after nearly each mob or you aoe grinded as prot with consecration which was way faster.</div></div><hr />

Yeah I am loving it, went from a latency of 215 - 230ms to a 54 - 62ms so cool to have stuff happen faster now.. Just have to wait now for Blizz to get Armory working for us.. lol</div></div><hr />

Indeed, for a long time for several classes, mass killing mobs WAS the most efficient way of levelling.<br />
<br />
Interesting if they bring this back, because people mass kill certain mobs for cloth, people mass killed those mobs in The Vale in MoP for keys and so on, mass killing for hours on end is nothing new for legit players.</div></div><hr />

Nothing long about it, it was happening before even finishing a quest objective.</div></div><hr />

You obviously aren't in the beta if you think Draenor is recycled. It looks nothing like Outland aside from some semi familiar architecture that's rebuilt/destroyed depending which continent you're on.</div></div><hr />

I think he didn't word it correctly. Considering <br />
<br />
Alternatives like questing, dungeons, or PvP are all supposed to be more lucrative than that<br />
I assume he wanted to say that they never wanted mass-killing mobs for experience to be the most efficient route.</div></div><hr />

Leveling is already trivial as it is, this anti-exploit mechanic is really just Blizzard being a nanny and micromanaging everything that players do. Just let it be as it is, people that want to farm level 100 characters will always find a way to exploit the game. Every time Blizz &quot;fixes&quot; something they break something else and in the process create an even worse exploit.</div></div><hr />

Yeah that was pretty surreal of them to say. I remember the old &quot;optimized quest path&quot; guides and the arguments about horde having more quests but alliance having better flightpaths and all that. And yes, frost mages had that blizzard aoe farming spec that took off after 28 I think, and in 1.9 and beyond, prot pallies could keep a rolling ball of 10-20 mobs and just never stop AoE grinding in certain spots in each level range, and these were far and away the most efficient leveling options for most players.<br />
<br />
I also remember, I think for every expansion, some dude would powerlevel to the cap in 20 hours using some cheese AoE tagging technique with their guild. So basically if mass AoE grinding weren't the most efficient leveling path in WoD, that would be a semi-miraculous first for the game. And boring too, honestly, because clever grinding and powerleveling tricks are half of the interesting part of the game. What's fun about being led around by a nosering made out of embarassing dialogue and fetch tasks?</div></div><hr />

I was there for a year, and trying to play blizzard games (and at the time League of Legends before they released servers last year I think) was a nightmare! A bit late, but better late than never!</div></div><hr />

During peak hour (7pm-8pm) Brisbane time, I had 25-35ms the entire time. It's such a huge difference playing melee.<br />
<br />
No more tunnels, wowping, smoothping etc. So good!<br />
<br />
I think PvP wise, as long as you play during somewhat normal times, you'll encounter mainly other aussies / nz as well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If something breaks will they take forever to fix it (not a priority) where as before because there were US players and it was hosted in the US its more in their control.<br />
<br />
Is there a Blizzard arm of the company in AUS or was it outsourced to some random group of newbs who bid the lowest price in the tendering process. <br />
<br />
Anyone able to allay this fear?</div></div><hr />

Almost all &quot;breaks&quot; that you experience are able to be fixed remotely, the exception is physical faults (extremely rare).</div></div><hr />
