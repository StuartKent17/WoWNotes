Vicious War Raptor?<br />
<br />
<br />
Awww yiiis. Yes, it's probably the RBG saddle mount, like the PvP horse and wolf, and undead horse and saber in MoP, but it does mean a new raptor model, which then could be a pet! Yesssahh! Way overdue.</div></div><hr />

The Shirvallah talent seems pretty cool, and I'll probably get it, but as its worded it sounds more utility than dps. So, I don't think it will be on the 100 row, or I am wrong.<br />
<br />
I looked up Shirvallah ( http://wowpedia.org/Shirvallah ) and she/he's a LOA, so I am expecting this form to look like the Saberon.</div></div><hr />

Brewfest and hallow's end items have nothing to do with release date. They have always been revamped when an expansion is released. Wod is still out next year when those events happen most likely.<br />

<br />
I have horde toons too, but I think it's still shit. Giving it for free if you re-sub so their sub numbers for the quarterly report will appear to be higher. It's still unfair to those playing alliance only.<br />
<br />
But I wouldn't touch a chopper like that even with a ten foot stick. It's like bronze drake, everyone is flying one because it's easy to get. I prefer to ride mounts that not everyone else around you is riding as well. /uniquesnowflake</div></div><hr />

6.0 will be on the PTR for about 1-2 months before it's released, and then the expansion will come out approximately one month after 6.0. For comparison, 5.0.4 PTR came out in late July 2012 and was live in late August. MOP was unlocked in late September.<br />

Yeah, the pre-expansion patch will be tested on the PTR servers, like all the other major patches. They're separate from the Beta servers, so I wouldn't consider what's going on in Beta if you're trying to gauge when 6.0 will release. If you want to time when the pre-expansion patch is coming out, just wait for the news that 6.0.x is on the PTR and then it should be about a month or so from there, depending on how much they need to test will all the stat and number changes.</div></div><hr />

Also, those raptors look so badass! Can't wait to tame one, and hopefully get that mount, but i'm guessing it's a horde arena or RBG reward.<br />

Keep in mind they added ALL the holiday stuff, not just brewfest. And these have came up in past expansions when they were added and never ended up matching the release.<br />

The beta is still quite a mess, we are just now allowed to level to 100 starting tomorrow. I think sep release is a super super long stretch.</div></div><hr />

excuse my ignorance but isn't the content of the 6.0 patch what is already testing in beta? I mean isn't the only thing that needs test some technical issues of the patch and not the actual content? Usually major patches have content like dungeons and raids, e.t.c. and thats why they need 1+ month testing. Maybe they can have a 1-2 week ptr on this one.</div></div><hr />

who cares about them? :cool:. On the real note, theorycrafting is a &quot;hobby&quot; making a change on a class and give them new numbers to mess around is like dropping the ball to a dog to catch it. trust me, they like new changes :)</div></div><hr />

I mean isn't the only thing that needs test some technical issues of the patch and not the actual content? Usually major patches have content like dungeons and raids, e.t.c. and thats why they need 1+ month testing. Maybe they can have a 1-2 week ptr on this one.<br />

Beta = 6.0.1<br />
6.0 that will be put on the PTR is almost all changes except Draenor (content/garrison/raids/dungeons) that needs to be tested:<br />
- Stat squish<br />
- New stats<br />
- Removal of hit/expertise<br />
- New &quot;flexible&quot; normal/heroic and 20 man mythic raiding<br />
- Old content changes so we can still solo that<br />

Shirvallah form moves on all fours, and a variety of clawing attacks. For now, skin choices are limited, but that's something we may expand on in the future. Tauren look like Lions, Trolls look like Tigers (thus the name), Worgen look like Snow Leopards, Night Elves like Panthers&quot; <br />

yeap but all these are already tested right? If we are going to have 6.0 1 month before release then that mean that all these are tested and ready because the last month before release the product is ready and company start dealing with the distribution of the product...so why 6,0 should need extensive testing instead of 1-2 weeks of stability(mostly) test?</div></div><hr />

Err no. A month before release being ready was something done back in 2005 or so. These days you just get an older version of the build on the disc and changes will be pushed through with launch day patches. <br />
Or the days/weeks after in hotfixes.</div></div><hr />

I dont really feel it makes sense to limit Lone Wolf to just Survival. I mean, a Marksman would be just as independent of a pet as a Survivalist is, if not even more. <br />
I'll just have to wait a bit to see if they revert it. If not, no big loss for me, or Blizzard - but a certain sour taste in my mouth.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard should maintain a proffesional, profound and sublime feeling to the game as much as you possible can. In fact Blizz should work on making it better than ever before! Vanilla wow had just a few simple mechanics, simple quest,simple fights, but since players felt that there was something more to know and appreciate from the proffesional/profound/sublime presentation,they got hooked and kept playing. Avoid all this vanity attitudes you try to feed us. Were not appreciating the game more because of it, it's a lose to us and a lost to you artist-hood, it's a lose-lose.<br />
