Vashj'ir - Underwater Combat 
We're working to ensure combat, breathing and travel are less cumbersome in this underwater zone than many of you may be thinking.

Vashj'ir - Underwater Combat<br />
We're working to ensure combat, breathing and travel are less cumbersome in this underwater zone than many of you may be thinking. The zone is quite large with a great deal of quest content and exploration to be done. In many areas you'll really get a deep ocean feel, but since you're questing down there, we want to make sure underwater gameplay is greatly improved.

Uldum / Larger 5-man Dungeons<br />
There's a level 85 five-player dungeon you might just learn about soon which holds seven bosses in a single instance. It's in a place you may have heard of before... Uldum. ^.^ (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/24401900506/a-couple-larger-dungeons-please/))<br />
<br />
Armor upgrades at level 40<br />
We talked about changing it, but decided we liked it the way it is. It's a pretty nice reward to suddenly be able to equip mail or plate at higher level. By similar logic, you could argue that we should make helms, shoulders, trinkets and even mounts at low level because they're awesome upgrades and players are going to get them anyway.<br />
<br />
It doesn't actually make the itemization simpler to add plate at lower levels. We have to create more items and make sure they are well distributed. That's not a huge consideration either way, but you listed it as a benefit and we don't see it like that.<br />
<br />
We also don't think it's a huge balance problem either way. Nobody is so weak below level 40 that perfect gear optimization is really going to make a difference between success and failure.<br />
<br />
The strongest justification for letting e.g. warriors use plate at level 1 is the feeling at level 40 of having to swap out all of your gear. But even in that case if you hold on to the mail for a few more levels until you get a more suitable quest reward you're not really going to be at a noticeable disadvantage.

Healing in Cataclysm<br />
Our goal is for paladins to be able to raid heal. Don't look at the designs for spells that none of you have even been able to try and conclude those mechanics can't possibly allow you to raid heal and therefore our goal can't possibly be met and will therefore be abandoned. It's fine to raise concerns -- that's one of the reasons we announce stuff like this early -- but some of you are trying to get a spell buffed that you haven't even cast yet.<br />
<br />
I will say our vision for the AE spell though is not that the paladin runs around constantly, but that you position yourself where you can do the most good. Sometimes that will be back with the healers. Sometimes that might be in the melee. Sometimes you'll have to spread out and your group healing won't be as efficient (in the same way a shaman's group healing isn't as good in the same scenario).<br />
<br />
Tranquility is on a very long cooldown. It is not the way druids AE heal. We want to shift it from 5-person group to raid because we'd like to do that with every spell. Having to organize players by arbitrary group is a strange concept since it doesn't actually manifest itself in the real world (in the way distance from you on the battlefield does).<br />
<br />
We aren't going to give paladins anything resembling Circle of Healing. One (or two) of those spells in the game is plenty.<br />
<br />
Spirit will be a good stat to stack but only to a point. Once you can heal say a six minute boss fight without going out of mana, then any additional Spirit is pretty much wasted. At that point stats like crit start to look pretty attractive because they increase your spell's throughput without increasing the mana cost. Maybe you'll be able to heal someone with one cast, allowing you to swap over and heal another player. In today's healing environment, where a lot of that excess healing will be wasted overhealing, getting a huge crit on a spell isn't nearly as valuable.<br />
<br />
We'll have to see how raid healing goes. We might be okay with the tendency for groups to still assign paladins to tank healing because they are particularly good at it. What we want to avoid are those cases where a group feels like they can't possibly keep tanks alive because they lack a paladin or they can't possibly keep groups alive because they have too many paladins.

Rogues Cooldowns<br />
<br />
In actuality it's not quite this extreme, but the stereotypical rogue encounter is that if they have their cooldowns available, they're going to wreck you and if they don't have their cooldowns available, you're going to wreck them. Giving Cloak a chance to fail was a way to make sure that rogues couldn't guarantee that they would be immune to spells for a few seconds. Usually they would be, but sometimes they'd get unlucky and the lock or whoever would have a chance against them.<br />
<br />
In Cataclysm, we want to reduce both extremes. That is, the rogue shouldn't feel invulnerable when they have all of their cooldowns available and they shouldn't feel helpless when they get caught without them. In that environment we think it's safe to remove the chance to fail because Cloak won't be the only thing that determines victory or defeat vs. a caster. Things like Smoke Bomb and larger health pools as well as other changes should help keep a rogue alive when Cloak is on cooldown. Likewise, the warlock won't be stunned so much so they won't be quite so frustrated when the rogue does pop CoS.<br />
<br />
Having a ninety percent chance to succeed is actually a pretty frustrating place to be. At that point you aren't grateful when you roll lucky. You're mad because you were so unlucky. At 90% you start to count on something, which makes it worse for it to fail. If Cloak had a 10% chance to succeed (we wouldn't do that, but just for sake of argument) then you'd feel awesome when it did work because you got lucky. What I'm getting at is that it's not like we thought the 90% deal was super fun gameplay. We just thought it was necessary.<br />
<br />
Without the entire gamut of Cataclysm changes though, we're not sure rogues need a PvP survival boost at the moment.<br />
<br />
My paladin comment above was more poking at the silliness of expressing &quot;Gotcha!&quot; because we figured out a way that we're comfortable getting rid of a 10% chance to fail on Cloak of Shadows. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/24401900017/gc-5-months-ago-100-cloak-is-i-win/))<br />

Bladestorm<br />
It isn't necessary to change Bladestorm just because Whirlwind changes. If you want to blow the cooldown for a single target damage boost we don't really have a problem with that. Whirlwind was balanced around doing single target damage, which meant it just got free damage when there was more than one target. Bladestorm by contrast doesn't amount to a sizable chunk of damage in PvE. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/24262411597/now-i-gotta-ask-about-bladestorm-in-cat/))<br />

Good way to do that would be to give slightly better rewards for doing the longer ones. Now, I don't mean higher iLvl necessarily, but, for example, in heroic mode two bosses dropping epic gear instead of just the one; then again, extra &quot;emblems&quot; or whatever they use in this expansion might make it worth it in and of itself to do the longer one - assuming it doesn't take so long to do that it becomes more efficient to do, say, three other dungeons in the same amount of time (back to where the multiple bosses with epics might keep enough people playing the dungeon).<br />

Why? Why can't you have a class that has these extremes? If you want to play middle of the road class, play a warrior or something. Now that leveling alts is ridiculously quick you won't get stuck with a class whose playstyle you don't like.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Blizzard's biggest mistake since vanilla has been to think &quot;hey look, majority of people like X, lets make everything X&quot;. For example, &quot;most people say SM was their favorite dungeon in vanilla, lets make every single TBC dungeon into 3-winged SM copy&quot;, or, &quot;most people seem to enjoy paladin AoE tanking and AoE nuking in TBC, lets make everything clearable by AoE spamming in WotLK.&quot;<br />
<br />
The mistake is that while the majority might prefer one type of mechanic, dungeon, playstyle etc., they probably don't like the same thing all the time (e.g., doing BRD style instance every once in a while can be fun even if you prefer short AoE fest instances) and there can be a sizable number of people who prefer something completely different (even if 90% prefer one thing there's still over a million players who want something else).<br />
<br />
This is why the homogenization of WoW results in so much whining in the forums. I hope Blizzard learns from their mistakes and gives us diverse content in Cataclysm. For example, each major content patch could add one long, hard, un-puggable progress raid instance, couple of puggable 2-boss raid encounters, couple of short AoE-fest 5-mans and one longer 6-8 boss 5-man. That adds up to roughly the amount of work they've been putting into content patches, maybe a bit more, but would ensure diverse content for everyone to enjoy.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, we probably need to make Winter's Chill apply the entire stack at once like Improved Scorch and Improved Shadow Bolt. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/24401690235/boneheads-and-winter-s-chill/))<br />

Having it as a stack when it applies all at once wouldn't make sense, nor would it be remotely in line with the way dispel mechanics are changing.<br />
They don't want junk buffs or dispel resistance because it leads it an arms race.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is a difference between playstyle, and being 100% gimped without cooldowns. It takes a godly rogue, or a retarded victim to kill anyone without a cooldown as it is now, and it shouldn't be that way. Rogues should still stand a chance even if their cooldowns aren't ready, we will still have to play stealthy however.</div></div><hr />

<br />
New class changes : Underwater breathing spells can no longer be cast on other people and now have a duration of 2minutes with a 30min cooldown!<br />
<br />
World changes: All underwater breathing items and potions have been removed from the game<br />
<br />
New mount changes : A new mount has been released its a yellow submarine! this single person mount costs 120k G and allows players to breath underwater however the submarines air tank only lasts for 30 min then an additional air tank must be purchased for an additional 20k gold. In addition a glowing submarine is available at the blizzard shop for 50$ and air tanks for 5$ each.<br />

For example, &quot;most people say SM was their favorite dungeon in vanilla, lets make every single TBC dungeon into 3-winged SM copy&quot;, or, &quot;most people seem to enjoy paladin AoE tanking and AoE nuking in TBC, lets make everything clearable by AoE spamming in WotLK.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
This is how I felt for a long time. To be honest the more I hear about cataclysm the less excited I become. Every class change announced was basically 'we can't figure out how to make a happy medium; so every healer, dps, and tank will be the same'. What's the point of having 10 classes if they all play the same. Hey, perfect balance, knock out 7 classes, have 1 tank, 1 dps, 1 healer that can do everything. Why bother with such variety when in the end you want everyone the same.<br />
<br />
The other thing that I hate is gear progression. They made WOTLK; more so then BC and Vanilla; about gear and gear only. The reasoning is quite obvious too, they can't deliver a good story to drive us to raid; they don't have content such as a unique zone that would only be available through raiding past a certain boss or something.. so they just give us gear. Old content becomes obsolete as newer raids become available. The badge vendors upgrade with better gear so you don't even have to see the older content.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They definitely will, of something very easily obtainable. They're not going to inconvenience an entire playerbase because a few people farmed up a rare water mount in the previous expansion. I mean, that would be the most hated zone in the expansion if they didn't. I sure know I would stay away like it had aids if I had to do the entire zone at regular swim speed.</div></div><hr />

Why is this a goal at all? None of the palas I've talked to, myself included, want to be a raid healer. We're all happy to leave that to others, and stick to tank healing. Can't understand why Blizz seem to think this is desired.</div></div><hr />

I find the host rather dull and boring, and when he says the actual news (and doesn't rant some bad joke) he talks so fast that it becomes annoying and tedious to hear what he has to say. I've only viewed the show twice though, the first time it was posted and now, so I might just have had bad luck?<br />
<br />
Or is it just me? :P</div></div><hr />

Because they want all healing classes to be able to heal everything, all DPS classes able to DPS everything effectively and all plate classes to be able to tank everything. I'm not a huge fan of the philosophy because it causes way to much homogenization, but w/e. Mages are looking good, so i can't complain.<br />

I don't know about Vashj'ir. Quests that took place underwater were quests I immediately abandoned. Hopefully it will be cool.</div></div><hr />

I am glad to know how smart you are. Perhaps ou should work as eng. teacher.<br />
<br />
Argue the topic/subject , not the person and his grammar or punctuation. If the only thing you can find to attack in someone's arguments is their spelling and grammar, then you probably aren't discounting their argument or question in this case. MMO games or forums wasn't made for testing ppls english skils, online are many players who can't always express themselves eloquently, but if you skip over things like say grammar and punctuation, don't be surprised if people skip over you. Chating is not The TOEFL® Test - and communication doesnt need a perferct language skill and here i point over spelling , grammar etc. etc.<br />
Even when disagreeing and giving criticism. If you claim something is a fact, not just your opinion or impression, prove it. <br />
<br />
In response to Brandon: IMO doesn't exist such thing as best MMO or best realm - all depends of your perception, is very depending on online community and your friends. MMO imo is a community game played with friends - &quot;home is there where your heart is&quot;<br />

Salute and respect with much apreciation all game developers and producers. <br />
