Soon, we’ll be introducing a new feature called Battle.net Balance that will give players an alternate way to purchase Blizzard products and services directly through their Battle.net account. Players will be able to “charge up” their Battle.net Balance using a variety of payment methods, and then use their Battle.net Balance to buy services like World of Warcraft character transfers, digital products like pets and mounts, and more. Players will also be able to use their Battle.net Account Balance to buy items and store their earnings from Diablo III’s currency-based auction house once the game is released.<br />
<br />
We’ll be rolling out the new Battle.net Balance feature in the weeks ahead -- but in the meantime, check out our Battle.net Balance FAQ (http://us.blizzard.com/support/article/balancefaq) to find out more about how it’s going to work.<br />
<br />
<br />
Battle.net Balance Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)<br />
What is Battle.net Balance?<br />
Battle.net Balance is a new Battle.net feature that will allow players to store value in their Battle.net account, which can be used to buy Blizzard Entertainment products such as World of Warcraft game time, paid services, digital versions of games, and in-game pets and mounts.<br />
<br />
With the upcoming launch of Diablo III, players in certain regions will also be able to use their Battle.net Balance to acquire items from the game's currency-based auction house. Diablo III players will also have the option to store earnings from items they sell on the auction house in their Battle.net Balance, to be used on future auction house purchases or to buy Blizzard products. For more information on the Diablo III auction house, read the auction house FAQ.<br />
<br />
How will I add value to my Battle.net Balance?<br />
When you log in to Battle.net Account Management, you will be able to add value to your Battle.net Balance through a variety of different payment methods, such as debit or credit cards or a variety of region-specific payment methods. Please note that depending on the payment method, it may take some time for the Battle.net Balance you purchase to become available to use.<br />
<br />
Can I convert my Battle.net Balance into cash?<br />
Once funds or Diablo III auction house earnings have been added to your Battle.net Balance, you are not able to convert that Balance into cash. Battle.net Balance can only be used to buy designated Blizzard Entertainment products or to acquire items from Diablo III's currency-based auction house.<br />
<br />
In certain regions, Diablo III players who wish to &quot;cash out&quot; the proceeds from the sale of an item from the currency-based auction house instead of storing it in a Battle.net Balance will be able to do so via PayPal for an additional fee. Players will need to determine which method they wish to use at the time they post their auction. For more information on the currency-based auction house, see the FAQ.<br />
<br />
Will I need to use Battle.net Balance to make Diablo III auction-house purchases, or will other payment options be available?<br />
Diablo III players will be able to make purchases on the currency-based auction house directly (without using Battle.net Balance) via several popular payment methods, such as major credit cards. A wider range of payment alternatives will be available for those who wish to use Battle.net Balance.<br />
<br />
What currencies can I use to charge my Battle.net Balance?<br />
In general, you will be able to add value to your Battle.net Balance using your local currency (in EU, for example, players will be able to use Euros, GBP, and RUB). In certain regions where game realms and servers are shared by players in multiple countries, you may also be able to use additional countries' currencies. However, please note that Battle.net Balances for different currencies are tracked separately and cannot be used interchangeably. For example, you cannot use Battle.net Balance purchased using U.S. dollars in a non-USD-based auction house, and you are not able to transfer Battle.net Balance purchased in one currency to or from Battle.net Balance purchased with a different currency. We'll have further details to share closer to release.<br />
<br />
Will there be a limit to how much I can store in my Battle.net Balance?<br />
Yes, there will be limits on how much can be stored in your Battle.net Balance. We'll have more information closer to release.<br />
<br />
Can I transfer my Battle.net Balance to another Battle.net account, or give Battle.net Balance as gift?<br />
Your Battle.net Balance is non-transferrable. At launch, there will not be a way to give Battle.net Balance as a gift to another Battle.net account holder; however, we're looking into the possibility of adding that feature in the future.<br />
<br />
How long will my Battle.net Balance remain in my account? Will it ever expire?<br />
Depending on local laws and regulations, we may be required to remove the Battle.net Balance from any Battle.net account that hasn't been accessed in over 3 years.<br />
<br />
Will I be able to track purchases made with my Battle.net Balance?<br />
Yes, you'll be able to track your purchases through Battle.net Account Management.<br />
<br />
Can I use my Battle.net Balance as the automatic payment method for my recurring World of Warcraft subscription?<br />
No, though you are able to pre-purchase World of Warcraft game time using your Battle.net Balance.<br />
<br />
What payment methods are available to charge my Battle.net Balance?<br />
All of the payment methods we currently support through Battle.net will be available to charge your Battle.net Balance, with a few exceptions. We'll have more details to share closer to launch.<br />
<br />
Can I use Battle.net Balance in combination with other payments to make a purchase?<br />
You will be able to use Battle.net Balance in combination with another payment type to make certain purchases through Battle.net Account Management, such as World of Warcraft paid services. However, you will not be able to combine payment types to make Diablo III auction house purchases.<br />
<br />
Are there any fees associated with using Battle.net Balance?<br />
Blizzard Entertainment does not charge additional fees to add to your Battle.net Balance or to use it to buy Blizzard Entertainment products. However, there are listing and transaction fees associated with the Diablo III currency-based auction house, regardless of the payment type.<br />
<br />
Where can I see my Battle.net Balance?<br />
Your Battle.net Balance will be visible in Battle.net Account Management, as well as in-game in Diablo III.<br />
<br />
Is Battle.net Balance available in the Diablo III beta test?<br />
In the Diablo III beta test, we are currently testing the in-game functionality of Battle.net Balance. Players are given a limited number of &quot;beta bucks&quot; to use on currency-based auction house purchases. These &quot;beta bucks&quot; reflect how Battle.net Balance might be displayed and/or used when Diablo III is ultimately released, though as with all things in the beta, this is subject to change. Please note that any &quot;beta bucks&quot; earned in the beta test will not be retained when Battle.net Balance is released.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;Rest assured players that while we are aware moronic design decisions are driving away hundreds of thousands of subscribers we have implemented a way to leech more money off of the ones that remain. Now you can just give us lump sums of cash and we'll maybe give you an incentive 'use' it on virtual products. Our profit margin will remain the same, so never you fear about Kotick Inc.-- I mean, Blizzard going under!&quot;</div></div><hr />

This makes sure that only Blizz makes real money. You can't withdraw cash from this ever. The only way you can use this to &quot;make&quot; money is by essentially &quot;saving&quot; money by using you blizz bucks for stuff you would have purchased with real money (game time or vanity items). So how does this stop gold farming?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Exactly. Once hard currency enters the foodchain, they will do everything they can to prevent it from leaving. This 'wallet' approach was always the end game. They can earn interest on a reserve fund of liquid cash they'll keep on hand for payouts until its 'consumed' through internal services.<br />
<br />
I am hoping that Diablo 3 is a viable game to play without resorting to auction house items and real $ transactions. But everything points to 'no', and in an effort to protect wow subscriptions they'll sacrifice Diablo 3 game integrity. They've already sacrificed Diablo 3 boxed sales to save wow subscribers; somethign i never thought they'd do.<br />

All the WoW services can still use a credit card or real cash. This is just the middle-man for the D3 auction house. You put your money into the &quot;station cash&quot; and then use that in D3, and you can pull your &quot;station cash&quot; into actual cash. But of course, players will say this proves WoW is dying and going F2P and that blizz will sell gold, and epics, etc.</div></div><hr />

This is great for their revenue but useless for their customers. <br />
Are there any fees associated with using Battle.net Balance? Blizzard Entertainment does not charge additional fees to add to your Battle.net Balance or to use it to buy Blizzard Entertainment products. However, there are listing and transaction fees associated with the Diablo III currency-based auction house, regardless of the payment type. What the hell? They better not have a real currency LISTING fee on the currency based AH. I can understand taking a cut of successful sales and a GAME CURRENCY listing fee to keep every piece of junk from being listed, but it's bad to make people pay real currency to TRY to sell a virtual item. People should be able to earn money without having to spend any.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard doesn't want people to launder &quot;drug money&quot; though their services. You can cash out money you make on D3, as long as you don't place it in the Blizzard Balance. The only other way to get funds is by depositing them using your own money. Although you can't gift this money to other players (for the same reason that you can't cash out), they will probably let you buy services for other players, like paying for your friends server transfer.<br />
<br />
This system is better and more transparent than Microsoft or Nintendo points since it tracks currency interdependently instead of converting everything to their own currency. Although you won't gain interest, they won't simply devalue your own money you put in directly, and you are free to put in any amount you want instead of having left over points like other systems.</div></div><hr />

From the very first sentence...<br />
<br />
<br />
Battle.net Balance is a new Battle.net feature that will allow players to store value in their Battle.net account, which can be used to buy Blizzard Entertainment products such as World of Warcraft game time, paid services, digital versions of games, and in-game pets and mounts.<br />
<br />
Sell an item in Diablo III and use it to fund your WoW account.</div></div><hr />

The key word here is recurring. If you want to pay for your subscription you will need to transfer money to it manually as funds become available. You won't be able to have it automatically take money out every month.<br />

You have two options when you sell an item through the RMAH:<br />

Sell item &gt; Blizz takes cut &gt; rest goes to BNet Balance (Blizzard Bucks!)<br />
Sell item &gt; Blizz takes cut &gt; Paypal takes fee &gt; CAAASH MONIES!<br />

Except, I'm sure it costs real money to post auctions in D3? Meaning.. you're paying real money to post the auctions to sell them for Blizzard Bucks to then pay for game-time for WoW. Meaning you're still paying for game-time with real money?</div></div><hr />

<br />
As it stands, I can just take my Diablo sales, cash out the money and go buy some stuff off their store.<br />
<br />
Or, they tell me I can skip the middle man and transfer the money straight to Battle.net Balance and buy from the store, except NOW I can't cash out. I can take what was actually worth real money if I exported to Paypal, instead make it into valueless Bnet Balance, then use that to &quot;purchase&quot; a pet, which costs Blizzard absolutely nothing to give me since it's entirely digital. Except I already got money deducted TWICE from my Diablo 3 auction.<br />
<br />
Just a ploy for Blizzard to get 2 cash deductibles off your Diablo 3 auction then try and get you to turn that money into valueless Bnet Bucks so they don't actually have to pay a physical dime whatsoever so standard practice and manufacture fees, while pocketing 2 transaction fees off you.<br />

No... The point is to provide an easy way to use the real money you make from the D3 auction house on other Blizzard products. Being able to deposit money into this account is a logical addition to the system...</div></div><hr />

All the WoW services can still use a credit card or real cash. This is just the middle-man for the D3 auction house. You put your money into the &quot;station cash&quot; and then use that in D3, and you can pull your &quot;station cash&quot; into actual cash. But of course, players will say this proves WoW is dying and going F2P and that blizz will sell gold, and epics, etc.<br />
<br />
Wrong. You CANNOT turn your Battle.net balance into actual money. The ONLY, and I mean ONLY way to get money out of doing anything in any Blizzard game (possibly until SC2 Map Market) is to choose to Cash Out at the time you post an auction on a D3 RMAH. This means no money from that sold auction even touches your e-balance and goes straight through PayPal (after some fees are paid to Blizzard and PayPal, of course).</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joán</div><div class="date">2011-12-09, 11:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't think anyone yet pointed out the incredibly heavy implications of this sentence:<br />
In certain regions, Diablo III players who wish to &quot;cash out&quot; the proceeds from the sale of an item from the currency-based auction house instead of storing it in a Battle.net Balance will be able to do so via PayPal for an additional fee. This quote very strongly implies that in any region that is not within the subset of &quot;certain regions&quot;*, it will not possible to cash out from the D3 auction house in any other way than Battle.net balance, which of course completely defies the central point of a &quot;Real Money Auction House&quot;, since you can no longer make real money, but money that only is legal tender for Blizzard products.<br />
<br />
*(one would imagine that they would not have used this wording if it was a majority of regions, so a good question is, what regions DO get an actual D3 RMAH?)<br />
<br />
Even worse:<br />
<br />
Players will need to determine which method they wish to use at the time they post their auction.<br />

This was not how it was initially described. This one post in dozens of posts and panels is the fine print that I've been expecting all this time. Monstrously obvious money grab at this point. Taking a cut of my auction, requiring a listing fee, that's all fine and good. But once I've sold it, I can't withdraw my own money? Ridiculous.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Appletini</div><div class="date">2011-12-10, 01:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't think anyone yet pointed out the incredibly heavy implications of this sentence:This quote very strongly implies that in any region that is not within the subset of &quot;certain regions&quot;*, it will not possible to cash out from the D3 auction house in any other way than Battle.net balance, which of course completely defies the central point of a &quot;Real Money Auction House&quot;, since you can no longer make real money, but money that only is legal tender for Blizzard products.<br />
<br />
*(one would imagine that they would not have used this wording if it was a majority of regions, so a good question is, what regions DO get an actual D3 RMAH?)<br />
<br />
Even worse:<br />
<br />
<br />
You have to make the decision if you want real money or fake Blizzard money BEFORE you've made any actual money!<br />
<br />
Errr... yeah. You know how most companies don't offer contests to every country on earth? You know how a company has to set up subscriptions specific to every country they're in?<br />
<br />
Basically Blizzard is using this to allow people in countries they don't have cashing out set up in to still attain their money, at least in a sense. <br />
<br />
So here's your option other than donning a tinfoil hat if you live in one of those smaller countries that they may not be set up for at DIII's release:<br />
1) Get nothing at all from RMAH.<br />
2) Get Blizzard Bucks from RMAH that you can at least use for vanity crap, other items in DIII, WoW purchases, etc.</div></div><hr />

It's like a debit card, or the annual pass.<br />
<br />
Those who know they will buy every new pet will add the extra money in there for later. Those who do not will continue to use normal cash.<br />

I don't get how people have come to the conclusion this is insanely worse than straight up monetary transactions.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Runintowalls</div><div class="date">2011-12-10, 03:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What's the point?<br />
<br />
for them: its like a bank for you to deposit lump sums of money at a time. it guarantees they have money available. its the same as if you gave them a bunch of money. say you add $100 to the account, you can use it for pets, subscriptions, etc. the point is that they now have $100 the day you deposit. its free money for them. it cuts out the risk and uncertainty that you may unsubscribe.<br />
<br />
you most likely will never get the money back if you do stop playing. you're &quot;purchasing credits, and those can be redeemed for products&quot; but they have the money, and if you decide you don't want those products, tough luck, you don't get your money back. its much easier to enter your credit card number to deposit money than for them to credit your credit card a refund (which will probably NEVER happen. there will likely be a clause that states you bought tokens, you can spend tokens but can't get your money back)<br />
<br />
what exactly is happening here is the realization of your money into their hands for something you may value. if you lose interest or the value depreciates, they still have your money, which never loses value.<br />
<br />
what it does for you: nothing you can't do already. you can now make online purchases with a credit card. you could before. this is all for blizzard's favor.<br />
<br />
TL;DR its a tricky way of ripping you off. and getting rich at the customers expense legally.<br />

<br />
you can imagine all you want. unless you know of a legality regarding online money transfers that I don't. its merely an idea in your head. there is no technicality, you simply made up that idea to give blizzard the benefit of the doubt. its sad, but you're being taken advantage of and you smile and ask if they can use you again.<br />
<br />
there's a reason chuck e cheeses uses tokens that you buy ahead of time rather than quarters for their games.<br />
<br />
you spend $10 on tokens and you may go home with $8 worth of tokens. you are short $10 and only gained $2 worth of product. does chuck e cheese refund your dollars for extra tokens? blizzard most likely won't. they have your money. you can now go to chuck e cheese and play with the tokens you bought, regardless if you want to or not. if you don't want to, just throw them away, you're still out $10.<br />
<br />
<br />
this is a good explanation of what's happening here, on a smaller scale.<br />
<br />
this video makes some controversial claims, but overall its pretty accurate description of what happens in these situations.<br />

<br />
1) don't get too excited about the diablo auction house because the market will be so exclusive and a few end game BiS items will sell for dollars, while the rest will sell for pennies but more than likely no cash at all, and not even worth the effort to go to the bank and withdrawal.<br />
<br />
2) also, the people complaining, like myself, won't even use the feature, ever. its not crackheads complaining about crack or dealers at all. you only said that for sensationalistic laughs, but its not even remotely funny.<br />
<br />
all this does is create a bartering system that blizzard controls, for their own profit and advantage. the reason we have a currency that can be used as legal tender anywhere in the country is so money has value to everyone and we can have the control on what we buy. if you like this blizzard bank idea, maybe you would also like to get paid from work in chuck e cheese tokens. and you can spend those at chuck e cheese only. you can't return the tokens for cash, but you can buy as much pizza and play arcade games as you want. then when you win tickets you can buy toys for your kids, lol<br />
<br />
seriously though, you don't understand whats going on and why blizzard would implement this, so don't joke at others expense and mock people who do understand. crackhead jokes are so 5th grade.</div></div><hr />
