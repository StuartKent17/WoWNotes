Patch 4.3 - Chromatic Dragon Pet<br />
A &quot;ChromaticDragonPet&quot; model was added to the PTR with the latest build, it looks pretty cool for the moment but it might be a work in progress. It's also incredibly big for a companion pet, I'm not sure if it's because the model was just implemented or if it's intended, wait &amp; see! <br />
<br />

Fahrad<br />
VO_QUEST_43_FAHRAD_COMPLETE1_01 - Huh, a lucky blow against an unprepared opponent.<br />
VO_QUEST_43_FAHRAD_COMPLETE2_01 - She allowed herself to be defeated. The others will not be so weak.<br />
VO_QUEST_43_FAHRAD_COMPLETE3_01 - Indeed, my prince. Hidden in plain sight.<br />
VO_QUEST_43_FAHRAD_COMPLETE4_01 - Don't trust this one, your highness. Disguises, lies, flawless assassinations. No one is that good.<br />
VO_QUEST_43_FAHRAD_SCENE1_01 - Your highness, we caught this beast snooping around the caves just outside the compound.<br />
VO_QUEST_43_FAHRAD_SCENE1_02 - Shall we execute him, my prince?<br />
VO_QUEST_43_FAHRAD_SCENE1_03 - Yes, sir.<br />
VO_QUEST_43_FAHRAD_SCENE1_04 - Your first target is here, in the ruins of Gilneas. I've lost some of my best men already. Let's see if you can fare any better.<br />
VO_QUEST_43_FAHRAD_SCENE1_05 - If he succeeds in looting the whole of Gilneas, there is no telling where he'll hide next. Now is the time to strike.<br />
VO_QUEST_43_FAHRAD_SCENE2_01 - We've just located her here, in the caverns beneath Karazhan. (Laughs) Fearful for her life, she is researching arcane secrets buried beneath the foundation.<br />
VO_QUEST_43_FAHRAD_SCENE2_02 - She surrounded herself with a small army of deranged dragon cultists. They may not be right in the head, but they're well armed and dangerous.<br />
VO_QUEST_43_FAHRAD_SCENE3_01 - This one? Mingle with the arch-mages of Dalaran? Hah, I'd pay to see that.<br />
VO_QUEST_43_FAHRAD_SCENE4_01 - My prince, we should leave this place in case they come back to finish the job!<br />
VO_QUEST_43_FAHRAD_SCENE4_02 - Your highness! I have never tried to conceal what I am from you.<br />
VO_QUEST_43_FAHRAD_SCENE4_03 - That is not true.<br />
VO_QUEST_43_FAHRAD_SCENE4_04 - No, no, I am in control of the voices! They're here to help me!<br />
VO_QUEST_43_FAHRAD_SCENE4_05 - Kill.. they want me to kill you now! Why did you have to go and anger them?!<br />
VO_QUEST_43_FAHRAD_SCENE4_06 - You have proven too difficult to control!<br />
VO_QUEST_43_FAHRAD_SCENE4_07 - (Death scream.)<br />
<br />
<br />
Mostrasz<br />
VO_QUEST_43_MOSTRASZ_CUTSCENE_01 - I'm not afraid of you! Wait... who are you?<br />
VO_QUEST_43_MOSTRASZ_CUTSCENE_02 - But.. but.. Deathwing's minions may have you killed!<br />
VO_QUEST_43_MOSTRASZ_CUTSCENE_03 - (screams)<br />
VO_QUEST_43_MOSTRASZ_FLIGHT01 - Let's move out, friend. There's no time to lose.<br />
VO_QUEST_43_MOSTRASZ_FLIGHT02 - Aurastrasza is understandably upset. Under her care was the one black dragon egg that we believe was free of the taint of Deathwing's corruption.<br />
VO_QUEST_43_MOSTRASZ_FLIGHT03 - And it was stolen away from us by thieves in the night.<br />
VO_QUEST_43_MOSTRASZ_FLIGHT04 - You found for us our only lead. The rogues from Ravenholdt are behind this!<br />
VO_QUEST_43_MOSTRASZ_FLIGHT05 - Ravenholdt; it just doesn't make sense! A mongrel band of petty thieves? How did they even know about the egg?<br />
VO_QUEST_43_MOSTRASZ_FLIGHT06 - We'll get to the bottom of this. Someone with your skills is exactly what we need.<br />
VO_QUEST_43_MOSTRASZ_FLIGHT07 - What's the expression? To catch a thief, they say? Hmm?<br />
VO_QUEST_43_MOSTRASZ_FLIGHT08 - Look at this devastation. These foothills have never recovered from the campaigns of the second and third wars.<br />
VO_QUEST_43_MOSTRASZ_FLIGHT09 - Ruins and debris litter the landscape, and I consider the thieves and assassins of Ravenholdt to be part of that debris.<br />
VO_QUEST_43_MOSTRASZ_FLIGHT10 - Without a state, without a cause.. What drives them, do you wonder?<br />
VO_QUEST_43_MOSTRASZ_FLIGHT11 - And what posessed them to strike out against the red dragonflight? Madness. We must learn more!<br />
VO_QUEST_43_MOSTRASZ_FLIGHT12 - We're almost to Ravenholdt manor.<br />
VO_QUEST_43_MOSTRASZ_FLIGHT13 - If they have the egg, it's too dangerous to risk an all out assault. You'll need to sneak in there, find out what they're up to, and retrieve the egg at any cost.<br />
VO_QUEST_43_MOSTRASZ_FLIGHT14 - Quiet now. We'll form up a plan within this cave.<br />
VO_QUEST_43_MOSTRASZ_Greeting01 - Let us spring into action.<br />
VO_QUEST_43_MOSTRASZ_Greeting02 - Hello friend.<br />
VO_QUEST_43_MOSTRASZ_Greeting03 - Any news?<br />
VO_QUEST_43_MOSTRASZ_Greeting04 - What do you have for me?<br />
VO_QUEST_43_MOSTRASZ_STEALTH01 - Stay on the ground and stay hidden. I'll port you back here if you get into any trouble.<br />
VO_QUEST_43_MOSTRASZ_STEALTH02 - Don't forget to use your stealth!<br />
VO_QUEST_43_MOSTRASZ_STEALTH03 - That's it, you've got this. Keep it up.<br />
VO_QUEST_43_MOSTRASZ_STEALTH04 - Careful. The front door is too heavily guarded. Hmm. Circle around the back of the manor and maybe we can find another way in.<br />
VO_QUEST_43_MOSTRASZ_STEALTH05 - Where are you going? The manor is in the other direction!<br />
VO_QUEST_43_MOSTRASZ_STEALTH06 - Hmm, it doesn't look like there's anything over here. Try circling around to the back of the manor.<br />
VO_QUEST_43_MOSTRASZ_STEALTH07 - Hah, there are no guards back here. Maybe you can find a way up onto the roof.<br />
VO_QUEST_43_MOSTRASZ_STEALTH08 - Nice work. Is there a window up there? Look around.<br />
VO_QUEST_43_MOSTRASZ_STEALTH09 - You did it; you're in! Now, where would they be keeping the egg? Some place dark, I would imagine. Be careful!<br />
VO_QUEST_43_MOSTRASZ_STEALTH_FAIL01 - I've got you! That was close.<br />
VO_QUEST_43_MOSTRASZ_STEALTH_FAIL02 - You need to be careful! They're on full alert.<br />
VO_QUEST_43_MOSTRASZ_STEALTH_FAIL03 - Well, that got ugly. You're lucky I'm here.<br />
VO_QUEST_43_MOSTRASZ_STEALTH_FAIL04 - You weren't trying to pick their pockets, were you?<br />
VO_QUEST_43_MOSTRASZ_STEALTH_FAIL05 - Gotcha! Let's try that again.<br />
VO_QUEST_43_MOSTRASZ_STEALTH_FAIL06 - Are you crazy? They'll see you if you go flying around in there!<br />
VO_QUEST_43_MOSTRASZ_STEALTH_FAIL07 - You can't fly here! You'll be spotted for sure!<br />
<br />
<br />
Wrathion<br />
VO_QUEST_43_WRATHION_COMPLETE1_01 - Excellent work, friend. You've proven that a single skilled assassin can strike a decisive blow where a whole army may fail.<br />
VO_QUEST_43_WRATHION_COMPLETE1_02 - If you wish to continue our work, we will need some additional supplies.<br />
VO_QUEST_43_WRATHION_COMPLETE2_01 - Incredible. Few assassins would be clever enough to infiltrate Nalice's wards and use her own magic against her.<br />
VO_QUEST_43_WRATHION_COMPLETE2_02 - Perhaps. For that reason, we will need to gather more supplies.<br />
VO_QUEST_43_WRATHION_COMPLETE3_01 - Dalaran? He's been hidden there this whole time.<br />
VO_QUEST_43_WRATHION_COMPLETE4_01 - You slew him right in the purple parlor? Incredible, simply incredible!<br />
VO_QUEST_43_WRATHION_COMPLETE4_02 - There's no need to worry, Fahrad. This next mission is quite likely suicide.<br />
VO_QUEST_43_WRATHION_FINAL_QUEST_01 - Don't underestimate my father. Even if you were to crush his body, the core of his madness and rage will still struggle to destroy you.<br />
VO_QUEST_43_WRATHION_FINAL_QUEST_02 - He will not be defeated until he is utterly annihilated.<br />
VO_QUEST_43_WRATHION_FINAL_QUEST_03 - I wish I could help, but my father is the one dragon I fear.<br />
VO_QUEST_43_WRATHION_FINAL_QUEST_04 - Best of luck, rogue. Whatever the outcome, you are truly a champion.<br />
VO_QUEST_43_WRATHION_SCENE1_01 - That's right, mortal. The prize you seek no longer sleeps within a shell. Here I am, in the flesh.<br />
VO_QUEST_43_WRATHION_SCENE1_02 - I'm not some trophy for a red dragon's mantlepiece, and I'm never going back.<br />
VO_QUEST_43_WRATHION_SCENE1_03 - Don't look so surprised. We dragons are conscious, even within our shells. As I grew, I could hear the plotting and scheming. I was to be born a prisoner. <br />
VO_QUEST_43_WRATHION_SCENE1_04 - But I'm one of a kind. A black dragon, raised free from the taint of my father's corruption. And that's how I intend to stay -- free.<br />
VO_QUEST_43_WRATHION_SCENE1_05 - Somehow, you managed to elude all of my guards. You slipped in here like a ghost. That makes you valuable to me. Let's talk.<br />
VO_QUEST_43_WRATHION_SCENE1_06 - You don't recognize your former prisoner?<br />
VO_QUEST_43_WRATHION_SCENE1_07 - No, I want him to deliver a message to the red dragonflight.<br />
VO_QUEST_43_WRATHION_SCENE1_08 - Tell them that I am free of my father's madness, and I will be free of them as well. I am to be left alone. This will be my first and only warning.<br />
VO_QUEST_43_WRATHION_SCENE1_09 - Deathwing's minions should be afraid of me. Get him out of here!<br />
VO_QUEST_43_WRATHION_SCENE1_10 - And Fahrad?<br />
VO_QUEST_43_WRATHION_SCENE1_11 - Break his legs.<br />
VO_QUEST_43_WRATHION_SCENE1_12 - Now then, my new friend. We have much to talk about.<br />
VO_QUEST_43_WRATHION_SCENE1_13 - As you know, black dragons frequently disguise themselves as humanoids in order to tamper with mortal affairs.<br />
VO_QUEST_43_WRATHION_SCENE1_14 - While the house of my mad father collapses around him, the few remaining black dragons have gone into hiding.<br />
VO_QUEST_43_WRATHION_SCENE1_15 - But I can still sense them. My cowardly brothers and sisters will cause untold suffering if we allow them to stay in the shadows.<br />
VO_QUEST_43_WRATHION_SCENE1_16 - Moreover, they are a threat to me.<br />
VO_QUEST_43_WRATHION_SCENE1_17 - That is where you come in. Help us to slay them all, and I will reward you handsomely.<br />
VO_QUEST_43_WRATHION_SCENE1_18 - The dragon you're looking for goes by the name Creed.<br />
VO_QUEST_43_WRATHION_SCENE1_19 - He's deluded a group of diseased humans into thinking they can take their land back. He's poisoned their blood with his own draconic essence.<br />
VO_QUEST_43_WRATHION_SCENE1_20 - If you live through this, I assure you it will be worth it.<br />
VO_QUEST_43_WRATHION_SCENE2_01 - The gems you collected will be able to augment the power of the weapons I gave you. But I require another ingredient. It will come from your next target.<br />
VO_QUEST_43_WRATHION_SCENE2_02 - Her name is Nalice. And until recently, she stood at Wyrmrest Temple as the representative of the black dragonflight. Now, she's on the run.<br />
VO_QUEST_43_WRATHION_SCENE2_03 - I hope to see you back from this mission alive, but if I do not, I want to say I've enjoyed seeing you work. You're a credit to your race. Good luck.<br />
VO_QUEST_43_WRATHION_SCENE3_01 - Fermion is a crafty one, my friend. To flush him out, you'll have to operate in disguise and hobnob with the elite of Dalaran society.<br />
VO_QUEST_43_WRATHION_SCENE3_02 - Succeed here, and our work is nearly done. Good luck, hero.<br />
VO_QUEST_43_WRATHION_SCENE4_01 - Your eyes do not deceive you. The trecherous red dragonflight sought to kill me off. I hope now you see the truth about them.<br />
VO_QUEST_43_WRATHION_SCENE4_02 - I can feel it, as if a dark shadow has been lifted from the land. Dead! My father is dead.<br />
VO_QUEST_43_WRATHION_SCENE4_03 - Champion, you have your reward. But there is one final dragon we need to slay.<br />
VO_QUEST_43_WRATHION_SCENE4_04 - Fahrad! I was just talking about you. The final black dragon. The one who's been more hidden than any of them.<br />
VO_QUEST_43_WRATHION_SCENE4_05 - Yes, you rescued me while I was still within my egg. And I owe you my life.<br />
VO_QUEST_43_WRATHION_SCENE4_06 - But you are a black dragon, and you share the corruption of all my brothers and sisters.<br />
VO_QUEST_43_WRATHION_SCENE4_07 - Do you deny it? The dark visions, the voices in your head?<br />
VO_QUEST_43_WRATHION_SCENE4_08 - And what are they telling you now, Fahrad? What do your dark masters whisper?<br />
VO_QUEST_43_WRATHION_SCENE4_09 - I will never be controlled! The red dragonflight has no idea what they unleashed when they experimented on my egg.<br />
VO_QUEST_43_WRATHION_SCENE4_10 - Hero, strike now! Use your newfound power to finish him!<br />
VO_QUEST_43_WRATHION_SCENE4_11 - It is done, friend. To my knowledge, I am the only black dragon who remains.<br />
VO_QUEST_43_WRATHION_SCENE4_12 - A new age for mortals has dawned, and heroes like you are among the vanguard.<br />
VO_QUEST_43_WRATHION_SCENE4_13 - I must go now, disappear.<br />
VO_QUEST_43_WRATHION_SCENE4_14 - Perhaps we will meet again. I hope we find ourselves on the same side.<br />
VO_Wrathion_Greeting01 - I do not share my father's madness.<br />
VO_Wrathion_Greeting02 - A new era is beginning.<br />
VO_Wrathion_Greeting03 - I must remain hidden so that I remain free.<br />
VO_Wrathion_Greeting04 - I believe an individual can have an enormous impact on the world.<br />
VO_Wrathion_Greeting05 - You do not want to make it on to my list.</div></div><hr />

Seeing the fate of the head of Ravenholdt is fascinating, though. Rogues engaging in the legendary questline may want to get to exalted with the faction if it becomes a case of losing access to that repeatable quest when he's outed and gutted.</div></div><hr />

Sure we could sit here and read it or watch the videos of people doing it when they come out, but why can't they let other people in on the quests just for the lore. Seems a tad over the top just to let a small portion of one class in the game to experience all of this and leave the rest of the dedicated players out. Not saying they shouldn't have something special lore-wise for their legendary quest, but something as influential on the future of the black dragonflight should be available for everyone to experience. I'm sure a lot of people would want to see this for themselves after killing Deathwing.<br />

This has confussed the absolute crap out of me. BLIZZ SEBELLIAN STILL LIVES!!!! Why is there no mention of him what so ever and also the whelps Sebellian was taking from the wyrmcult in blades edge, its pretty obvious Sebellian existed only for outland and was never fully thought through.

Forgot about the Black Dragon in Northrend that Blizz also forgot, ie Serinar, another in outland Blackscale, who patrols outside the wyrmcult cave.<br />

I agree that a lore event like this (and the last Legendary caster-staff event as well) should be shared with the playerbase as a whole. Even Shadowmourne had story elements that were worth sharing with all players. The 'epic questing' knob here is turned up to 11... but not for everyone. Truly a shame.<br />
<br />
The Thrall questline we got in 4.2 was similarly epic... and I'm grateful we got it. But I want more. ;)<br />
<br />
It seems that Star Wars TOR is making story a huge, huge part of your character's leveling experience, and that is a good thing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm not gonna comment about Serinar, that guy seems to have been pretty much forgotten... or just died somewhere along the road to where we stand now.<br />
<br />
But Sabellian? I don't think they have forgotten him, and I feel like they're leaving him out on purpose. Not only does Wrathion say that no other black dragon is alive &quot;to his knowledge&quot;, but Sabellian was featured in the black flight's family tree as being Deathwing's direct son, making him Onyxia and Nefarian's brother. His whelps have possibly grown into dragons even older than Wrathion by now, and it's not a huge stretch to believe some of them would be females.<br />
<br />
The only problem I see is that Wrathion really wants to be left alone... at least for now. Inb4 &quot;LEAVE WRATHION ALOOOOOONE!!&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If Wrathion cannot see that &quot;going it alone&quot; opens him up to influence by the Old Gods (or their agents) or perhaps even outright death, while he is young and relatively unprotected... well, he's either a fool, or the people writing his character are fools.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's not just a recolor...the face is completely different and it has big wings on its back...it just has a serpentine body.</div></div><hr />

<br />
aspects are considered the father/mother of all dragons born under their flight, regardless of weather they were actually hatched from an egg they laid and/or fertilized.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thats cuz chromatic can also refer to the bronze dragonflight for being affiliated with time, and wouldn't refer to the chromatic dragonflight alone. As the pet is gold/bronze, it just shows the pet is a bronze whelp. ie. Chromie</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">good diu bro</div><div class="date">2011-10-09, 10:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I guess according to the dialog wrathion is literally the last black dragon around by the end of all this.They've been our enemies for so long, aint that a shame they'll be borderline extinct. At least they will exist, unlike the fate of the twilight flight from the looks of it.<br />
<br />
VO_QUEST_43_WRATHION_SCENE4_11 - It is done, friend. To my knowledge, I am the only black dragon who remains.<br />
<br />
Hold it, he kill all the females black dragons?<br />
How can he have sex and offsprings now?<br />
<br />
So, now we know Nalice (http://www.wowhead.com/npc=27765) will get killed.<br />
But then, will Serinar (http://www.wowhead.com/npc=26593) or Sabellian (http://www.wowhead.com/npc=22103) get killed as well?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mistral</div><div class="date">2011-10-09, 02:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">For me it's very likely that Wrathion could be an prankster. We have nothing but his word that the whole swarm is corrupted but he not, don't we? In fact he send us to kill every important black dragon besides himself who could be a threat to his reign as the new aspect of earth. We do know that black dragons are natural intriguers and tricksters. That's maybe why we don't REALLY kill off any black dragons (Serinar/Sabellian/even more), so there will be a posibillity to replace this little Deathwing Jr. when all of a sudden he's attacking everything or waken up some real monster. For now I think that Wrathion is maybe allready insane and will become a new threat soon.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Since he adds &quot;To my knowledge&quot;, Wrathion may just be referring that he's the only black remaining in Azeroth. Implying that Serinar got killed probably trying to help Deathwing.<br />
<br />
As for Sabellian and the other Black Flight left in the Outlands, 1: they could have come to Azeroth to help Deathwing if they knew he had returned so they could have also been killed off so Wrathion truly is the last Black. Or 2: Deathwing probably didn't give a fig about them and just left them which would just make Wrathion the only black in Azeroth. <br />
<br />
And if there are Blacks left in the Outland that would give Wrathion the potential for a mate if Blizz does a ret-con with them, or just one female, by saying they, she, was freed of the Old Ones by the energies released during the destruction Draenor. Because if the Black eggs that became Netherwings became free of the Old Ones during the destruction, why couldn't it have occured with the older Blacks?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Its starting to look like there is a relation beetween Murozond / Nozdormu and Wrathion. I get the feeling the whole plot of the new legendary daggers will be something like : Go back in time, steal the unhatched egg of Murozond and have it cleansed, so it hatches as Nozdormu. Get legendary's and a new minipet for the whole guild (mini nozdormu)<br />
<br />
Can't help thinking about it since a few weeks and I havn't seen anyone write about this yet.<br />
<br />
Pure speculation ofcourse...</div></div><hr />
