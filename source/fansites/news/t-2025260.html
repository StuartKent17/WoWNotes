Legion - Vengeance Demon Hunter Spell Animations<br />
With the pre-expansion patch approaching and new spell animations mostly finalized, we are going back and finishing up our series of previews.<br />

Warcraft Movie Update<br />
Warcraft has now been released for at least a week in all markets. There is a nice interview about the work ILM did on the movie here (http://www.artofvfx.com/warcraft-jeff-white-vfx-supervisor-industrial-light-magic/). <br />
<br />
<br />
The movie is up to $430M worldwide now.<br />
When doing motion capture, up to nine orcs could be displayed in real time, superimposed over the actors on the monitors and through the lens for the camera operators.<br />
Baby Thrall was one of the hardest characters to get right, designed for maximum cuteness with the right amount of Orc.<br />
ILM worked on the movie in some capacity from Comic-Con 2013 to April 2016.<br />
Over 1,000 people were working on the movie effects at one point.<br />
<br />

Grove Warden Mount Availability<br />
Hopefully not too off-topic... While this testing is going on - anyone know if the moose is still dropping at 100% in heroic on the PTR? Never was any confirmation that I could find if it was going away in the pre-patch (like the SoO wolf) or going away at Legion launch. Important for guild planning. Thanks in advance.<br />
The Remnant of Chaos that awards the Grove Warden should be available until Legion launches on August 30 (along with the guaranteed Mythic mounts becoming rare drops). We'll have a blog in the very near future with details about what's changing when.<br />
<br />
<br />
Shop Helm Transmogrification Updates<br />
With the upcoming Transmogrification system updates coming in Legion, the purchasable helms from the Shop— Crown of Eternal Winter, Hood of Hungering Darkness, and Jewel of the Firelord —will automatically be added to your Collection within the Appearances tab.<br />
<br />

Blue Posts<br />
On PTR &amp; Beta Stability<br />
We're aware of the surge of reports in the last 24 hours, no updates but we're working on it. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/415803-on-ptr-beta-stability/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/20745705655?page=3#47))<br />
<br />
FEEDBACK: Xavius (Normal)<br />
The Emerald Nightmare raid zone is now accessible in Normal difficulty, with Xavius active. Normal difficulty scales from 10 players up to 30, and players must manually form groups to enter the zone. Player level and item level will be scaled accordingly. Please use this thread for feedback. We plan on keeping Xavius available over the weekend. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/416568-feedback-xavius-normal/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/20745746795?page=1#1))<br />
<br />
FEEDBACK: Hellfire Citadel<br />
In case any groups are feeling curious/generous and want to try out new class mechanics in an all-too-familiar raiding environment, Hellfire Citadel is open on all difficulties on the PTR.<br />
<br />
Please use this thread for any bug reports or tuning feedback. With a global nerf aura active now, and taking into account changes like the loss of passive stat raid buffs, the goal is for the zone to feel somewhat easier across the board in 7.0.3 than it does in live 6.2.4. Logs are especially appreciated. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/416379-feedback-hellfire-citadel/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/20745586779?page=1#1))<br />

Armory Stats - I Choose You<br />
Today we are taking a look at the &quot;I Choose You&quot; achievements (http://beta.wowdb.com/achievements?filter-search=Choose). The data used today is a sample of 2.6 million US and EU accounts that have been active since April 2016. While you wait for your phone to recharge before playing some more Pokemon Go, you could probably go earn one or two!<br />

Unfortunately stock is very limited, resulting in expensive cards. Differnet versions with nicer coolers are starting to come in stock. New cards from AMD are also on the way. <br />
<br />

<br />
The current SSD prices (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2016/june/ssdgraph.gif) are fairly flat right now, with most SSDs under $0.50 per gigabyte when on sale.<br />
<br />
Depending on how much you want to overclock, you may need to spend a bit more for a better CPU cooler like the NH-D15 (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00L7UZMAK?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mmochamp-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00L7UZMAK). <br />
<br />
Unless you are doing a lot of video rendering or streaming, you do not need the 6700K and should spend that money elsewhere.<br />
<br />
Make sure to keep your AMD (http://sites.amd.com/us/game/downloads/Pages/downloads.aspx) and Nvidia (http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us) drivers up to date.<br />

I miss the &quot;I Choose You&quot; mechanic in raids, the Paragons kind of had it and so did the elders in ToES but everyone followed the same order I think.

No, just dumb shit. I like Game of Thrones and that's successful. Also the movie is not on it's way to being successful. It MIGHT make 70m in dvd sales but that would just stop it from losing money. It bombed, I called that it would, therefore I'm happy. See? Positivity!</div></div><hr />

Considering that Warcraft is to some extent the most original film to come out of Hollywood in the last 5 years, and about the only place it did not do well was in the US and well we all know why.. When you have Hollywood rehashing, rebooting, retreading pretty much every movie out there.. <br />
<br />
Look at what they did to Ghostbusters a classic movie now made into a travesty with the new version, Terminator: Genesys a complete wreck of the original.. The Total Recall reboot was garbage, there are many more classic movies ruined with reboots/rehashing..<br />
<br />
Hollywood has had very few if at all original ideas of late what with this need to remake already existing movies..</div></div><hr />

The movie is doing much better than i expected. Mostly thanks to China.<br />
<br />
It's now ranked #205 in All Time Worldwide Box Office. Not bad, if you consider how many Movies there are. And it can easily go a bit higher, since there are many Movies with about the same Number.</div></div><hr />

LOL. Yeah, Warhammer totally invented all this orcs and dwarves and RPG and Fantasy shit.

Yeah the game is a clone of Warhammer, if I remember right (not entirely sure) when Blizz asked Games Workshop if they could do a Warhammer game and they were told no.. So they made some slight changes and in the end we got Warcraft and WoW..</div></div><hr />

<br />
You're not too bright are you? Here's a tip, I was comparing video games. You should look into how Warcraft was made and it's relation to Warhammer then get back to me. Of course I could say the Warcraft movie was a Lord of the Rings ripoff and go straight to the source but the critics already did that.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">elvor0</div><div class="date">2016-07-11, 10:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Of course I could say the Warcraft movie was a Lord of the Rings ripoff and go straight to the source but the critics already did that.<br />
<br />
Well yeah, you could say that, but then the only way that comparison could even be attempted would be if you didn't even see the movie, a single trailer or have a very, very very broad definition of &quot;rip off&quot; . Even stretching it as far as possible, the only resemblance is the presence of Orcs, Elves, Dwarves etc, and as much as I love Tolkien, he didn't invent those things, and just having them present doesn't make it a rip off. <br />
<br />
And I mean yeah for the games, the Warhammer-Warcraft link exists, but it's very clearly its own entity at this point, with the exception of the Orcs being green and a few other surface aesthetic similarities, everything else is completely different. WC1 and 2 are so far removed from what Warcraft is at this point. Even WC2 really distances itself from its Warhammer roots.</div></div><hr />

For the people not playing Pokemon Go yet, you can do a fast google search for pokemon go on iphone and you will find a guide on how to get it if it's not released in your region yet. I did it and I'm now playing it here in Denmark.<br />

I think you should look up what the definition of &quot;bombed&quot; is. Warcraft didn't bomb. It just did poorly DOMESTICALLY. It has made a respectable amount worldwide. After home release sales are factored in, it's definitely enough for a sequel. Not to mention this message by the Chinese Box Office, which strongly hints at a sequel:<br />
<br />
http://i1.wp.com/bitcast-a-sm.bitgravity.com/slashfilm/wp/wp-content/images/warcraft-socialmedia-china.jpg?resize=600%2C238<br />
<br />
And just saying, just because some website claims that Warcraft needed $500m to make a profit, doesn't necessarily mean they're right. Unless it comes from Legendary themselves, I wouldn't put much belief into it. I read on another website that it actually needed $450m. And considering it's made over $430m so far from theatrical runs alone, with home media sales still to come, I think it's safe to say that we will be getting a sequel. <br />
<br />
To end my reply, I just wonder why you are the way you are, that you want things to fail. Why would you want anything to fail? Especially a film adaptation of the game franchise you must enjoy playing (as you are on this site).

I like Game of Thrones and that's successful. Also the movie is not on it's way to being successful. It MIGHT make 70m in dvd sales but that would just stop it from losing money. It bombed, I called that it would, therefore I'm happy. See? Positivity!<br />
<br />
430 million worldwide box office is not a bomb.<br />
<br />
It's only a bomb by the standards of some asspulled &quot;needs 500 million to break even&quot; meme invented by &quot;analysts&quot;. The movie was good (not great), it made a ton of money (except in the US, due to RT shitflinging campaign + bad marketing), and it will most certainly get several sequels with 100+ million budgets.<br />
<br />
I have no idea what Game of Thrones has to do with this movie, that's like comparing Boardwalk Empire to Indiana Jones, because they both take place in the 1930s. GoT is grimdark in all ways, Warcraft is bright fantasy world which tends to have tragedies.</div></div><hr />

Glad to see the movie didn't make any money. 70m short of the black. Maybe the chinese will get a straight to dvd sequel and you guys can wait for a translation.<br />
<br />
70 million short of black? Based on what exactly? The movie was only 160 million to produce and the marketing budget was anything but large. Since the movie was very frontloaded I'd assume Legendary made some money off it.<br />
<br />
It's not super successful or anything but it was profitable.</div></div><hr />

Nowhere at all in the US that I can find has them in stock at $199. The only ones I found have the default cooler that isn't great and are at $300. Until you can actually purcahse the card, I'll be considering it &quot;on the way&quot;. <br />

As soon as they are reliably in stock I'll be updating the build of the month page, just like I did for the 1070 and 1080.</div></div><hr />

what test system did they use on the 1070 fps benchmarks? I get nowhere near as 187fps in legion beta on my 1070 OC @ 2ghz i5 6600K OC @ 4,6ghz and DDR4 @ 3200mhz. i get about 55-99fps in the new zones at &quot;ultra&quot; aka 10 in legion.</div></div><hr />

But if..you don't complain, why would they make changes? <br />

Also, tell the people who are currently playing the classes and raiding with them in the legion beta that they don't know it feels or performs. This far along in beta, no significant changes are going to be made.</div></div><hr />

Why did they take away most of my utility (totems)<br />
How do I handle melee in pvp without mobility and without being able to cast while moving<br />

<br />
Sure, we could talk damage, but first they need to rework the class - oh shit, that is what alpha was for?<br />

Alpha is the start, beta is for tuning, live is there for fixing whats not ok. You're a caster, not a melee, but i get what u mean. Yet, its still beta.</div></div><hr />

Are you really so self absorbed that you only count the US data? Worldwide it did fine. The only reason it did poorly in the US is that we're a society still idiotic enough to think that teasing nerds is funny. The comical part abou that is I know multiple people who've never played WoW that watched it &amp; liked it. Literally everyone I know who didn't go see it made that decision based off what the critics said. I haven't heard a single person who watched the film give anything but a good review. That's not a bomb, it's a testament to how ignorant we've become in the US.</div></div><hr />

Yet the card is there and available. Even in my eastern european country there are RX480 available and in stock in my local small town retailer. And they don't have 1070 or 1080 in stock.<br />
<br />
MMO-Champion is international and right now just before Legion it is fair to add the RX480 just as fair as the 1070 is in there. <br />

Significant changes, I said. I say significant, because those are the changes that upset people, not the minor tweaks that history has shown will happen at this stage in a WoW beta. They don't overhaul class design mid expansion. Peoples predictions about how a class will feel in live raiding generally turn out to be true.<br />
<br />
It doesn't so much matter to me if Templars Verdict hits for 4% or 4000% weapon damage for example, it matters that I don't like the significant core gameplay changes that have been made to Retribution that turned it into a colossus smash design, which the warrior player base already demonstrated they strongly disliked. That isn't going to change at this stage. They never do at this stage. How it feels isn't going to change by changing numbers, because I don't like the feel of the core design. <br />
<br />
Your argument would hold water if we were talking about pure numbers, but we're not, we're talking about the feel. And all the numbers in the world won't effect the feel.<br />

1. No where in the US is quite questionable considering how big the US is :) <br />
2. MMO-Champion has an international base and while it might be possible that the card is not available in the US doesn't mean it's not available around the globe.<br />
3. You can not translate the EU prices directly to US prices as they have added VAT and other taxes. It's like buying milk from your neighbour but you first ship it across the ocean and back then add tax&amp;shipping and wonder why the hell it costs more....</div></div><hr />

My comment would still be the same. Just because some people whine, does not make something right. Wait abit, give it time to test before you mock something. I's still beta, they can add thing on beta or live, they've done it beore so why can't they now? <br />
<br />
My class doesn't feel good, dur dur hurp a derp.. its the same every expansion, until the release and then suddently its all silence. until we talk about numbers, then the whiners come back and whine that buuu a mage beat me, nerf plz. <br />
<br />
I won't mock anything until i see it live. on beta theres scaling etc and this might be doing something wierd with the feel of the class with spells not triggering or whatever. And lets be honest, elemental hasn't been fun these past years, enhancement has allways been the most attractive dps spec.<br />

Yes it's beta. Giving feedback on how the class performs and feels is literally part of my job in the beta testing. They can add things on beta or on live, they aren't going to change the core aspect of the design. They might tweak some spells, even add new ones over talents, but they clearly haven't any plans to change Judgement away from a colossus smash style game play which has been complained about since its inception or they would've done it by now. <br />
<br />
It's too late to make massive changes because there isn't enough time to test them. You shouldn't be waiting til live to test if something works at its base level, that's what beta is for. Live players aren't supposed to be guinea pigs, that's our job as beta testers. You're not there to dick around, you're there to give feedback and make sure stuff works. I mean, what the hell is the point if you don't bother giving feedback during the testing phases?<br />
<br />
<br />

Nope, Warriors complain about Colossus Smash style gameplay to this day. Or are you saying anyone whoever had concerns about their class ever has always been wrong and noone is ever correct or right to raise suspicions? <br />
<br />
<br />
I won't mock anything until i see it live. on beta theres scaling etc and this might be doing something wierd with the feel of the class with spells not triggering or whatever. <br />
<br />
I'm not mocking, I'm explaining my issues with the class. Because that is part of my job as a beta tester. Spells are not &quot;not triggering&quot;, there are no bugs or glitches with spells. It works as intended, I don't like what's intended. Stop just saying &quot;just wait, it might change later!&quot; because it doesn't mean anything, it's a completely nebulous statement. It might not change later either. Or how much &quot;later&quot; do you wait before you are &quot;allowed&quot; to complain because it might get better later? A month? 6 months? A year? Next Expansion?<br />
<br />
My class doesn't feel good right now, because I fundamentally dislike colossus smash style gameplay, please, please take that information on board and actually respond to the notion rather than making derp sounds, you're having a discussion here, not entertaining at childrens parties.<br />

It might not change later either. Or how much &quot;later&quot; do you wait before you are &quot;allowed&quot; to complain because it might get better later? A month? 6 months? A year? Next Expansion?<br />
<br />
My class doesn't feel good right now, because I fundamentally dislike colossus smash style gameplay, please, please take that information on board and actually respond to the notion rather than making derp sounds, you're having a discussion here, not entertaining at childrens parties.<br />
.<br />
<br />
Well ofcourse your job as a beta tester is to test the class and such. But as i said.. If 80% like it while 20% doesn't, does not mean its right or doesn't make what you are saying right etc. Blizzard is taking the masses over the minor people complaining about small stuff like &quot;we don't like colossus smash playstyle&quot; etc.<br />
<br />
I don't like my class since it has tons of passives and allmost no attack spells, but many people love this, should they then rework/rething the class, because i don't agree?<br />
<br />
I hate outlaw rogues, since its all RNG based, should they redo this spec because i don't like it or like the playstyle?<br />
<br />
Never said you can't complain, but its the same sh** every year/expansion.. Why not embrace the playstyles, learn it, master it, be the best at it. And when/if they change the playstyle you don't like, you'll be &quot;happy&quot;. <br />
<br />
Remember than blizzard does listen to the players, just look how &quot;casual&quot; the game is compared to tbc/wotlk times. Blizzard has been tuning/rethinking and listening to the players allways. But if a higher number % like the playstyle/class changes while the little % that doesn't like the playstyle/class changes.. well this should be enough for you to understand that they will listen to the higher % players ofcourse.<br />
<br />
I might be wrong, you might be the higher %, noone knows until blizzard acts. Complaining about the class/playstyle on this forum won't get you anywhere. Post a ticket, write down WHY you hate/dislike this playstyle etc. I bet this is why you havn't seen any changes, probably because the higher % likes the class, or people havn't said anything or given blizzard tickets etc about it.</div></div><hr />
