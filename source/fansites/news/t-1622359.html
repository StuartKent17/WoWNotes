Darkmoon Faire Updates<br />
The Darkmoon Faire is here once again, bringing some new features thanks to the Warlords of Draenor update. <br />
<br />
Icy Veins has a complete guide (http://www.icy-veins.com/wow/darkmoon-faire) to the Faire. Be sure to buy any heirlooms you want while it is active, as the old Justice Points vendors are gone for now.<br />
<br />
If you enjoy pet battles, pay Christoph VonFeasel (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/85519-christoph-vonfeasel) a visit to complete A New Darkmoon Challenger! (http://www.wowdb.com/quests/36471-a-new-darkmoon-challenger)<br />
<br />
Several old items are now toys, such as Moonfang's loot (http://www.wowdb.com/items/consumables?filter-search=moonfang&amp;filter-quality=8), the Darkmoon Whistle (http://www.wowdb.com/items/90899-darkmoon-whistle), and the Flimsy Yellow Balloon (http://www.wowdb.com/items/75042-flimsy-yellow-balloon).<br />

<br />
The most interesting addition is the Blazing Wings (http://www.wowdb.com/items/116115-blazing-wings). These are a set of cosmetic fiery wings that appear on your character. The one hour buff is granted by a toy that has a character specific one hour cooldown. This means you can have wings on your character constantly, as long as you don't die!<br />
<br />
The wings are earned through the achievement Brood of Alysrazor (http://beta.wowdb.com/achievements/9252-brood-of-alysrazor), which requires you to fly through 50 rings, similar to the rings that appear in the Alysrazor encounter in Firelands. This challenging part of this achievement is that the rings are shared by everyone and there are only slightly more than you need, so only one person can do the achievement at a time. It looks like this is unintended (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/528791195540258816) though, so if you aren't in a hurry you can wait and see if a hotfix is coming soon.<br />

Also so because the zone ashara is tied to goblins now, it's worth naming a whole mechanical expansion around it? Also if they're announcing overwatch this year, not having a panel at noon seems like a bad idea. :/</div></div><hr />

Announcing an expansion before the current one even launches would be an incredibly stupid thing to do.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ro9ue</div><div class="date">2014-11-02, 10:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It makes total sense that a mechanically themed Hearthstone expansion would be called &quot;Eye of Azshara&quot;, since the technologically advanced race of Azeroth essentially resides in the center of the zone Azshara. Hell, if you look at the map, it even looks like an eye.<br />
<br />
But I still want to hold onto the possibility that it's referring to the character. &quot;Eye of Azshara&quot; could also be stretched to translate as the focus of Azshara the character, or as in the eye of a storm, and she is very well tied to storms/water/ocean. I'm going to ignore the obvious answer of it being the goblin zone and instead hope its &quot;Warcraft IV: Eye of Azshara&quot;. I do feel like however slim the possibility of WC4, it's even less likely to be another WoW expansion announcement this close to WoD's release.</div></div><hr />

Azshara is a person as well as a Zone. She is the most powerful mage on Azeroth and is ranked up with Kil'Jaeden in power. Shes arguably more powerful than Deathwing.</div></div><hr />

Could you tell me, what does hint at EoA being the Hearthstone expansion? I mean, if there is anything different than the fact the expansion might be goblin-centered, and goblins have some sort of ties to Azshara?<br />
<br />
I could assume &quot;Eye of Azshara&quot; is some sort of a magic jewel, that goblins nearby want to claim using their gizmos, but... seing the Azshara theme has not been developed enough in WoW itself, I have problems believing that.<br />

Like why on earth would you make a 100+ card expansion based around Goblin machinery? And/or based on a single zone which isn't even that important. That's incredibly specific. It overpowers the varied theme of the cards, making it seem disproportionately focused on one kind of weird theme. <br />
<br />
There's really little to no evidence for it. If the trademark is legit it's got to be WoW.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wishblade</div><div class="date">2014-11-02, 11:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm just not feeling it with a mechanical themed expansion to HS called Eye of Azshara...<br />
<br />
Why Eye of Azshara? Sure, Bilgewater Harbor is the &quot;eye&quot; of the zone, Azshara, but why name it after that? Why not go for Gnomeregan instead? What's the special focus on Bilgewater Harbor? Why not go for Kezan instead of Azshara, even if Kezan is blown up somewhat? Going for Azshara also makes it seem more Goblin related than Gnome related, and if we're going for a mechanical theme then I don't see the sense in the name focusing on a zone habitated by just one of the races. If we're going for mechanics and engineering then it should have a title that sounds very engineering'y.<br />
<br />
What I see from an expansion like that would be all sorts of stuff, like:<br />
<br />
Tanks, gyrocopters, explosives, zeppelins, inventions, robots, lasers, paragliders, with Dwarves, Gnomes, Goblins and Titan stuff involved. Heck, even got iron stars and Iron Horde technology we can add to the mix.<br />
<br />
I'm just having a hard time connecting stuff like that to something called Eye of Azshara. I don't think that name would properly suit an expansion with all those things.</div></div><hr />

I find that...unlikely to say the least. The two games are very different in tone, Hearthstone is entirely light-hearted and comedic whereas WoW is at least trying to tell a serious story. Having Azshara as a wacky Hearthstone villain a la Kel'thuzad before her debut in WoW damages the WoW expansion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also so because the zone ashara is tied to goblins now, it's worth naming a whole mechanical expansion around it? Also if they're announcing overwatch this year, not having a panel at noon seems like a bad idea. :/<br />

Announcing the next expac before WoD even drops would be like plastering a 'It's safe to skip this one' sticker on the box. And Azshara has less to do about the zone and more about the lore figure.</div></div><hr />

I am not 100% sure, but, announcing a new expansion a few days before the launch of the current one is very weird...it will take all the hype of the current expansion which is bad business.</div></div><hr />

It actually makes kind of a sense, considering that Azshara was helping Sargeras to get to Azeroth and that the Eye of Sargeras was obtained by Illidan with the aid of nagas.<br />
<br />
The problem is that the Eye of Sargeras was apparently broken by Maiev, when Illidan tried to destroy TFT, but it could be possible that it was not actually destroyed or that it was a part of the pair (Eye of Sargeras and Eye of Azshara, which allowed their communication akin to palantírs of LotR)...</div></div><hr />

I'd see it as &quot;It's safe to get this one because you won't be stuck with the same content for 14 months&quot;<br />

No it would just mean they are planning for WoD to last a single year, meaning fewer post launch patches than MoP for $10 more. It's like handing out a flyer for the next iphone to people standing in line for the one about to come out.</div></div><hr />

Who's the Queen of the Naga then? I hardly pay attention to the lore (only Warcraft game I played was Warcraft 3 and I didn't even get past the first map) and even I know that. She was in Well of Eternity as well as in a quest in Darkshore. There's also various items related to her throughout the game such as a dress you get from archaeology. How can people miss that unless they didn't do or see any of it? Besides, didn't Hearthstone release an expansion centered around Naxxramas ... a raid? It's fully possible that Eye of Azshara (IF real) could be based just around the goblins and the zone or it could be based around the goblins, zone, and the nagas as well as maybe the elves. When you announce something, quite often, you don't announce everything. Where's the expectations and the excitement if you tell your customers everything? If it's the next WoW expansion ... release WoD first before you announce the next one. Let people get their claws into WoD a bit first before even considering hinting at the next one. That's just bad marketing and confuses people.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Another project made by one of their &quot;small dev teams&quot; like Hearthstone was. I'm guessing its going to be an X-Com like turn based tactical shooter, probably with a large focus on competitive multiplayer. In my mind, the word &quot;Overwatch&quot; is strongly associated with that kind of game.. and it really sounds like the name of an entire game to me, not just some expansion.<br />
<br />
They'll announce it in the opening ceremony, the suspicious gaps in the schedule will be filled with Overwatch panels. Done deal! Heard it here first!<br />
<br />
As for Eye of Azshara... uh.. well its obviously warcraft lore related. Could be HS expac or some sort of WoW expac. Azshara is still unaccounted for more or less in WoW and I believe she was going to have a raid in Cata but they never implemented it. So they'd of had a lot of fight ideas/art assets sketched out.</div></div><hr />

She is the most powerful mage on Azeroth and is ranked up with Kil'Jaeden in power. Shes arguably more powerful than Deathwing. Pretty sure Medivh is the only one who can match her toe to toe as a mage, but if Velen ever dabbled in offensive casting even she probably wouldn't stand a chance.(Dude is old enough to be HER grandfather.)</div></div><hr />

It's the laziest most idiotic design in this game. A robot head on some farmers clothing with like rhino feet or something. Why does a robot need a wide brim hat?It was originally created by the Defias in cooperation with Goblin mercenaries to scare superstitious farmers off their land, because they didn't realize it was a robot and believed that enchanted scarecrows had come to life and were trying to kill them. Hence they called it a &quot;golem&quot; because peasant farmers had no clue what a 'robot' was.<br />
<br />
It was actually a really clever and fun enemy concept back in the original Westfall. Now that everyone in Azeroth flies helicopters to work and the Golems have been relegated to &quot;Kill 10 boars&quot; routine maintenance even for the in-character NPCs like Saldean, yeah, the design falls a little flat and feels like stubborn nostalgia.<br />

Overwatch has got me stumped though, I hope its not the Protoss segment of the Starcraft 2 game because Overwatch sounds like a terrible name for the Finale of Starcraft 2.<br />
<br />
It's not. We've known for 5+ years that the last chapter will be called Legacy of the Void.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That would be something really interesting indeed.<br />
<br />
They did say they were working on a spectate mode for Hearthstone so maybe this could be it but as a bigger scale spectate mode that you can take advantage from the Bnet launcher if you have that person on your friend list. Similar to how LoL spectate mode works.</div></div><hr />

Which is most likely the case with the &quot;Overwatch&quot; trademark. Eye of Azshara is obviously Blizzard :D nothing to say there!<br />
<br />
I personally don't think there will be a brand new Blizzard product in the near future, the Starcraft Addon should be announced soon, maybe this or next year and of course maybe a Hearthstone Expansion, which makes sense!

<br />
Besides, I don't think they'd waste the name &quot;Eye of Azshara&quot; on A Goblin-based, mechanical expansion. It's just misuse of an excellent name. <br />

Besides, they said they'd probably even have the next WoW xpac ready by Blizzcon a while ago, so maybe they decided to show it.</div></div><hr />

Overwatch and Eye of Azshara are real, but what they're for... well, who knows outside of Blizzard? We'll all know in less than a week's time though.<br />

Also, sorry but people who think D3 is a bad game obviously hasn't played it since week one or read anything about the game as it plays right now.

<br />
Sorry, both of these statements are incorrect. It's not a crime to not end up using a trademark. In fact laws exist so that trademarks that don't end up bring used can be picked up by someone else. It happens all the time.<br />
<br />
Secondly nobody was suggesting that anyone fake registered the trademark - it's Blizzard who has registered it without a doubt. What's being suggested is that Blizzard registered it as a fake product to throw people &quot;off the scent&quot; and wouldn't be the first time Blizzard has done so.<br />
<br />
Note: I'm not agreeing it's fake, just explaining as you seem unfamiliar with trademark applications being used in this way.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Mannoroth discovered, to his chagrin, that Azshara was far more powerful than he, and that only Archimonde, Kil'jaeden and Sargeras could have matched her.&quot;<br />
<br />
Not that I'm disagreeing with you in response to his post, but he does have a point about Velen. I mean, technically, Archimonde and Kil'Jaeden should both theoretically be pretty equal to Velen aside from possibly having slightly more power given from Sargeras.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now that's what I want to see in Caverns of Time. Those final days on Argus.<br />
<br />
Cinematic idea for Argus expansion would definitely have to be a flashback of those final moments.</div></div><hr />

Don't forget that they've said that the new HS cards will not come exactly in a Naxxramas format expansion, but more like booster packs, and more than 100 new cards... nothing wrong with releasing 2 booster packs (wich is very common in card games).</div></div><hr />

You guys remember &quot;The Dark Below&quot;? It was a trademark filed by Activision, which was then used for a Destiny expansion. <br />
<br />
&quot;Overwatch&quot; just doesn't have that fantasy ring to it.<br />
<br />
I want to point something out.<br />
<br />
When Cataclysm was leaked before Blizzcon a TON of people on MMO-Champion went &quot;Blizzard would not name their expansion Cataclysm, it just sounds stupid&quot; and made statements like &quot;Every expansion name before has not been a single word&quot; ect, ect.<br />
<br />
Even if Overwatch sounds strange to you, don't throw out the possibility of anything solely based on the name sounding off or out of the norm.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think a lot of people are having trouble with this, but they really shouldn't be. WoW is an MMO and promoting future content over current content makes good business sense. First it reinforces the idea that WoW is alive and being actively developed and is not DEAD. Secondly, promoting an expansion after the current one that isn't released does not diminish Warlords of Draenor. It is all the same game. Money spent on any of it all goes into the same pot. The only way you can experience post WoD content is by playing through WoD.<br />

Unlike most other non-MMO games, promoting future content makes a lot of sense and is good business.</div></div><hr />

Exactly! By the way, if Blizzard wait next year before announcing the next expansion, there will be a year spent in WOD. Too late to announce the upcoming content. Because of the timing and because Blizzard would like to announce their new expansion at Blizzcon, I think it is logical that the announcement be done this week. In addition, Blizzard has repeatedly said they wanted to produce new expansions almost every year. I think now they have the team to do that.</div></div><hr />

Try again, RoS got a meta of 87.<br />
<br />
which is should not have had, anything above 70 just shows that blizzard can pay their way to &quot;good&quot; standings, it's sad that people think Diablo 3 is good when there is literally 20+ games in the same genre with a better loot system, better &quot;end game&quot; better classes, better prices, better everything.</div></div><hr />

So much wrong with this. You are *literally* just making shit up to suit your own little personal agenda. Which is wrong. You don't like it. You are just one seemingly butt-hurt little person. I don't play Diablo any more, but it's a very high quality product.</div></div><hr />

Yes, I enjoy it very much, will probably play again next season too.<br />
<br />
*Not to say it was always good, It was probably a 75 at launch, but with RoS it is a 90 - Nothing else compares.</div></div><hr />

I couldn't disagree more. Diablo 3 could have been really fun. Instead it was marred by a terrible launch, an auction house, a &quot;Real Money Auction House&quot;, and then the cardinal sin of them all - in their greed to get more of your Real Money, they made the game require an always-on Internet connection. People playing single player hard core mode have died and lost their characters due to lag. Meanwhile, if you're in the US Armed forces and deployed somewhere without Internet, screw you - you don't get to play.<br />
<br />
At least the name fits. Satan indeed. Sure glad I didn't pay for the game, I was one of the lock-in wow players so they could stop the sub bleeding.</div></div><hr />

WoW is Warcraft 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and soon to be 9.<br />

You have Warcraft and SC flipped basically. I think it's far more likely we'll hear about the next SC expansion since it's due. Oh, and I wouldn't be surprised to hear more about the future of Hearthstone, be it an expac or their design philosophy for the game going forward.</div></div><hr />

Overwatch Maro 0 and Mark 1 were golems made by Zixil and with the harvest golem and the overall theme those blueprints suggest I think we are going to see a goblin/golem expansion set.
