Icecrown Citadel Weekly Quests<br />
This patch finally activated the Icecrown Weekly quests datamined during Patch 3.3 PTRs. According to the posts on ElitistJerks (http://elitistjerks.com/forums.php) a NPC will spawn at some point during your Icecrown Citadel run to give you the quest. <br />
<br />
The quest is NOT part of the raid weekly quests we already have in 3.3, you can do both in the same week. <br />
The reward is a Sack of Frosty Treasures (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/52006/sack-of-frosty-treasures/) containing 5 x Emblem of Frost (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/49426/emblem-of-frost/), 25G, and 350 Reputation. You also have a small chance to get an Icecrown BOE item from this bag like the Wodin's Lucky Necklace (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/50452/wodins-lucky-necklace/).<br />
<br />
The following quests will be randomly available in the instance (one each week) :<br />
<br />
Blood Quickening (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/24879/blood-quickening/) - Rescue Infiltrator Minchar before he is executed.<br />
These Scourge bloodsuckers -- San'layn they call themselves - give me the creeps. We've had one of our best men keeping an eye on them. But this morning he got sloppy and got himself taken prisoner. He's being interrogated by the Queen herself right now, and his cries echo through the Crimson Halls. Please, save him before it's too late!<br />
<br />
Deprogramming (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/24875/deprogramming/) - Defeat Lady Deathwhisper while ensuring that Darnavan survives.<br />
We had hoped to place a man on the inside of the Cult of the Damned, to give us an inside angle on the Lich King's machinations, but we... underestimated the persuasive powers of Arthas and his dark minister, Lady Deathwhisper. Our man, Darnavan, is one of them now.<br />
<br />
If you plan on fighting your way through the Oratory ahead, please keep your eyes peeled for Darnavan. If you can bring him back to us alive, we can attempt to reverse the Cult's brainwashing. <br />
<br />
Residue Rendezvous (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/24878/residue-rendezvous/) - Return to Alchemist Adrianna while infected with Orange and Green Blight.<br />
Professor Putricide has been holed up in his foul laboratory, experimenting and refining increasingly lethal strains of blight to be used against us. If only we could obtain pure samples of the toxins, our researchers could concoct an antidote that would save countless lives.<br />
<br />
If you happen to come across live specimens, please return here immediately so that we can harvest them for study. <br />
<br />
Respite for a Tormented Soul (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/24880/respite-for-a-tormented-soul/) - Use the Life Crystals to preserve Sindragosa's Essence.<br />
Take this Life Crystal, and have your companions take one as well. It contains potent energies from the verdant Dragonshrine in Dragonblight, and it was my own secret to resisting the dark magics of this place for so long.<br />
<br />
When you face Sindragosa, battle her until she is weakened, and then have your companions use these Crystals to coax out the essence that is dormant within her. If you then defeat her, you should be able to recover it and return it to Wyrmrest Temple in Dragonblight. <br />
<br />
Securing the Ramparts (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/24877/securing-the-ramparts/) - Slay the Rotting Frost Giant.<br />
As if this place weren't enough of a madhouse to begin with, we're fighting a war on two fronts up here, with the Scourge on one side and those blasted Alliance dogs on our other flank! <br />
<br />
We are here to clear a safe landing for our vessels, but a behemoth of a giant on the other side of the Ramparts is hurling debris at anything that comes close and keeping our smaller ships at bay.<br />
<br />
I'll be honest -- he's a bit much for us to handle, but you and your companions look up to the task.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
really? im not sure thats how WoL works but if it is, can you upload a .1 sec kill so we can see if that changes the number of kills to two and lowers the average kill time lower?</div></div><hr />

ya most likely, maybe the fight ends 40 secs after some of your raid members fight inside frostmourn and that messes up WoL</div></div><hr />

<br />
Don't think so. There are 12 player and 10 have the title King Slayer - i think the other two are part of the raid pool who were unlucky and where benched or something like this.<br />

You can simply look at the top dps per boss and see that in many the boss was killed in less than a minute.<br />

Some EU guild will more than likely kill it tonight and then you and the other QQers will post that it isn't hard and is a disappointing ending to the expansion.<br />
<br />
Look at it this way. It took a top 25 man guild in the world to kill him in 10 man by drastically over gearing the encounter. Even the people who killed him said they don't see how it would be possible for a strictly 10 man guild. 10 man is just as much an achievement for 10 man strict guilds as 25 man is for 25 man strict guilds. The difficulty difference is overstated at best. One guild in the US managed to down him the first day. Sounds like an achievement on any setting.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I will have to agree, because i am in a 10m strict guild my self and some of the enconters are pretty tough. And this is mainly due to our gear being mainly 10 man gear and ICC vendor stuff.<br />
<br />
So yeah, best of luck to other 10m strict guilds!</div></div><hr />

<br />
indeed i am a bit worried about this point, it's true that for strictly ten man guilds 10 man icc is a big challenge.My guild hasnt been having alot of luck in 25 mans so has been focusing alot on 10 mans.Only one of our groups has succesfully beaten putricide and we have yet to try the blood wing of icc.<br />
<br />
also 25 man heroic gear is amazing , but 10 man heroic gear from toc seems lacklustre, we can beat togc heroic easy without a sweat but that fact alone doesnt make it any easier on us in beating 10 man icc even on normal.</div></div><hr />

We got the lady death quest last night, and rooted him in the back of the room the whole nite. Each of us got the bag (10 m), 3 got epic gems. The gold also seems to be a range, i got 10g, others got 25g, others got like 17g, 22g, etc. Seems to be a range of gold, not just a static 25g.<br />
<br />
So just wanted to add, chance at epic gems, and gold ranges.</div></div><hr />

Totally agree, i'm in a strict 10 man (we had issues just doing ToGC 10, we were able to as a guild do first 2, nothing beyond. I've been able to pug it since IC came out up to Anub, so out gearing it makes it easier) and some of these encounters with strictly 10 man gear seems much more challenging, than when I've gone on my alt with guys in a 25 man raiding guild. <br />
<br />
(Not sure if linked my armory on this forum, but if i did shadows edge, i had to pay a 25 guild for the 2 quest items, and voa 25 dropped my pants last night.)</div></div><hr />

<br />
You're kidding right?<br />
50 shards that only drops from 25-man bosses. And on normal difficulty, it's not even 100% drop chance. Only heroic ICC25 got 100% drop chance for 1 shard per boss.<br />

50 shards that only drops from 25-man bosses. And on normal difficulty, it's not even 100% drop chance. Only heroic ICC25 got 100% drop chance for 1 shard per boss.<br />

Lich King 10 man is zrz buzinezz. 2 of the top guilds full 25man geared, over gearing the encounter killed him. It surely is an easy boss ::)<br />
<br />
If you didn't see Naxx40 and didn't kill Kil'jaeden, I can guarantee you won't be killing LK 25 hc mode. <br />
<br />
So less QQ. If someone kills a boss doesn't mean you killed it as well. Get over yourself. Find the game to easy? You're too skilled? Stop playing and FUCK OFF. NO ONE CARES.</div></div><hr />

Heroics should be painful to say the least.<br />
<br />
As far as the quests go, yes, they exist in 10 and 25 and appear randomly after getting to certain areas (our 25 got one after beating the initial 4 boss fights, and our 10 man got one after beating Lady D), so it varies where and when you get them.<br />
<br />
On a note, the Rotface/Festergut one is interesting. You have to get hit by either the spore explosion or the 3 breath blast from Festergut to get his part, and take at least 1 tick of the slime spray from Rotface to get his. You need both of them to complete the quest, and if you die, you lose both of them. But, if someone in your raid turns it in, all members inside the dungeon will get credit for having both and can also turn in the quest.<br />
<br />
The Frost Giant one, at least in our 10man felt like another boss fight (6+ million health on 10man). He has an ability where you get a Death Plague debuff. If that person is not near another person when the timer goes off, the plague will kill that person. Otherwise, the debuff will go to a nearby person.</div></div><hr />

Nope, Mek was in the raid group that killed him and if you check his achievement history, you will find that they started around noon with Marrowgar. It took them 1 hour to get to FrostWing and then 45 minutes to get to LK. They killed LK 2hours and 10 minutes after Sindragosa.</div></div><hr />

I expect that Ensidia will kill him tonight. They had their &quot;fun&quot; raids afternoon and are no doubt ready for tonight's 25 LK.<br />
<br />
OT : Well you can say that the fact they killed him so soon is &quot;sad&quot;, but consider that they have finished this weeks raiding on 1st day, first few hours. It will take others &quot;slackers&quot; nearly whole week and I doubt they will kill him. Consequently &quot;casuals&quot; will invest much more time into WoW than Ensidia do.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We immediately privated our WoL parses after the kill to ensure that certain &quot;special&quot; parts of the fight are not spoiled. The log reveals way too much about key phases of the encounter and we'd rather guilds still had a chance to discover them on their own. The log also reveals the special ending not included in the cinematic, and we'd rather that not be spoiled as well.<br />
<br />
We had 5 different people Fraps the fight. There was no exploit involved. The encounter is incredibly long, and we can't wait to show it to you. As a common courtesy that every First kill brings, we are holding off on releasing it until other guilds have had a chance to get 2nd and 3rd on the Lich King. The fight is incredibly epic: and we want to keep it that way as long as possible.<br />
<br />
Best of luck to those racing to the next few kills, and the race is still on to kills in 25 man, and hardmodes shortly thereafter!</div></div><hr />

The Deprogramming and Rampart ones are simple enough. The third requires a Sindragosa kill, which may or may not be tricky for some guilds. Then you have killing Rotface and Festergut *without* wiping at all. And lastly, clearing the entire Blood wing in 20 minutes (which means chain-pulls and no wiping). Pretty brutal in comparison.<br />
<br />
For most guilds getting the 20 minute Blood wing quest means no extra emblems that week.</div></div><hr />

If your source is so accurate why does it say that no 10 man team has downed Valithria Dreamwalker? But somehow 55 10 man teams have downed Sindragosa, without killing Valithria...hmmm. Perhaps you should look at your source before you start spreading some ridiculous rumors. Obviously there is some data missing somewhere and people should be careful about just believing whatever some log that's not in any way affiliated with Blizzard says about who killed what and when they killed it. There's no way right now to prove or disprove the findings in that log, but with the missing/incorrect data from some of the other boss logs I would certainly be a little skeptical at the very least.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We immediately privated our WoL parses after the kill to ensure that certain &quot;special&quot; parts of the fight are not spoiled. The log reveals way too much about key phases of the encounter and we'd rather guilds still had a chance to discover them on their own. The log also reveals the special ending not included in the cinematic, and we'd rather that not be spoiled as well.<br />
<br />
We had 5 different people Fraps the fight. There was no exploit involved. The encounter is incredibly long, and we can't wait to show it to you. As a common courtesy that every First kill brings, we are holding off on releasing it until other guilds have had a chance to get 2nd and 3rd on the Lich King. The fight is incredibly epic: and we want to keep it that way as long as possible.<br />
<br />
Best of luck to those racing to the next few kills, and the race is still on to kills in 25 man, and hardmodes shortly thereafter!<br />
<br />
<br />
It looks extremely fun. I've watched the couple streams ont he front page yesterday and most of them couldn't get past 70% so I didn't get to see any &quot;special part&quot;.<br />
<br />
But as for a 10man normal encounter, how do you rate it in terms of difficulty?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tyelcaner</div><div class="date">2010-02-03, 07:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Why is there so much EU vs US stuff?<br />
<br />
A) It's 10 man... so it's not REALLY a first kill in YOUR eyes because people ONLY care about 25 man content. (Sorry 10 man guilds)<br />
<br />
B) When you have to factor in Ensidia killing the Lich King faster than Blood Legion you also have to take into account raiding times etc. Ensidia MAKES all of their raiders available as soon as servers come up. It is in their application process that you must be available at any moment when they need you aka TODAY ALL DAY THEY ARE RAIDING. Blood Legion only raids 7pm to 12am central. So the whole &quot;omg they beat it faster&quot; discussion is just plain stupid. JUST BE HAPPY TWO TOP GUILDS WERE ABLE TO DOWN IT.<br />
<br />
C) Will Ensidia down it 25 man faster? Probably. They are probably fighting him right now as we speak because they are NOT limited to &quot;raid times&quot; They raid ALL DAY when deemed necessary.<br />
<br />
D) EU-Nazjatar FOR THE HORDE has also downed Lich King on 10 man and no one said anything? Psh. Fan Boys.<br />

That's the worst analogy for the situation I've ever seen. How can you even compare using ICC-25 gear in a 10-man format as cheating? The content was there, there are no restrictions saying &quot;You can't use 264+ gear when difficulty is 10 man.&quot; It's fair game and they used ALL tools available. Instead of praising them, you're trying to tarnish them. Grow up.</div></div><hr />

If only 3 guilds in the world killed a 10man boss on normal mode supposed to be tuned for 10man gear in their 25man+heroic t9 gear, you know its hard. I'm sure at least one of those guilds, if not more, practiced him on a seperate 10man alt group also.<br />
<br />
Now, if only 3 guilds killed him so far in 25man gear on his easiest 10man difficulty, imagine him on 25man with heroic mode activated?</div></div><hr />

As expected, the quest giver appears while you're clearning trash to the gunship battle. The Rotting Frost Giant in question patrols around the far end of the trash; at the very opposite end of where you start clearing trash. <br />
<br />
This means you need to kill more trash than normal.<br />
<br />
The mob itself is actually pretty hard. It does a powerful AoE knockback which hits your entire raid for around half health. It does Icehowl's frost breath, but this is less nasty. It also puts a DoT on random raid members. THIS DOT WILL KILL INSTANTLY WHEN IT RUNS OUT IF IT'S NOT PASSED ON! Those with the DoT need to touch another player to pass it on, kinda like pass-the-parcel. Receiving the DoT also prevents you from taking it again for a while. <br />
<br />
Lots of AoE healing is required, and it hits tanks hard. This means that the mob is probably harder than any of the bosses (or trash) up to that point. It killed half our raid (we had no idea on the tactics lol), but YOU CAN RUN BACK IN IF YOU DIE! So it went down in 1 shot.<br />
<br />
There's no loot worth mentoning on the mob. You hand the quest back in to the nearby quest giver. Everyone got 5 frost badges, a little rep and some gold. One or two got an uncut epic gem as well (apparently). No sign of any BoE's, guess we weren't lucky or the drop rate is low. Probably both.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's not due to any kind of patch; it's due to everybody rushing back onto the servers and back into the instance to fight the new bosses. It happens every time new raid content is released no matter where the server is based or when it comes up. All servers suffer from this problem.<br />
<br />
The US servers receive any new content roughly 24 hours before any EU servers, and they both receive it long before the other servers around the world do, because that's how Blizzard schedules the server downtime.<br />
<br />
Can we please stop the US vs EU vs Everywhere Else arguments please? It's gone from entertaining to boring a long time ago.<br />

<br />
10man isn't designed to be easier, but it is designed for a lower gear level. So storming it with 25 man gear defeats the object.<br />
<br />
Not sure why people find this hard to understand.<br />
<br />
For guilds who lack 25 progression, 10 man is challenging!</div></div><hr />

Ever. We can argue about how you did it another time, but the fact remains that you were first.<br />

<br />
This. You can argue all you want that it's not fair the US got the content first; they popped the fuck out of that cold, icy cherry, and that's all that matters at the end of the day.<br />
<br />
Grats BL, grats to everyone who downs him in the future.</div></div><hr />

Did'ya think for a moment that maybe doing it on 10 man would help some of the players learn the encounter a bit better? So that way when they go in to the 25 man version they are definitely going to cut down the amount of attempts wasted.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sorry, but you fail.<br />
<br />
<br />
::) ::) ::)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Actually its not a fail, its a success. Should content be created that is based on luck and takes guilds 3 months to kill? Nobody likes that. <br />
<br />
<br />
WoW is based around &quot;luck&quot;</div></div><hr />
