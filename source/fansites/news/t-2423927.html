I thing we will just to to this underwater place, do some story, daylis, learn to hate her and kill her off. We don't need another Illidan story arc.<br />

To be fair now, Azshara has been known for talking down even the strongest of Legion members. Hell, she made Archimonde go &quot;Oh fuck&quot;. She even made Sargeras have a planetary erection.<br />
<br />
That's tough to do.</div></div><hr />

I think the retarded element here is you. Azshara flew away from the Well before it exploded (as seen in the WoE dungeon), so it's not hard to figure out this was much further inland from the demon invasion and a very small caption of whatever city it will have been.</div></div><hr />

The writing is as stupid as it gets. Neither of them had options, specially not Azshara because N'zoth could have just waited forever until someone else came along. On top of that, she's pretty much a slave anyways nothing changed, she's still a lackey of N'zoth. <br />

Azshara is known to be one of strongest &quot;mortal&quot; on Azeroth. And she was in his reach. Not something that happen often.<br />

You can twist any kind of writing in to bad writing if you want since it's all subjective anyway. That's what the mmoc crowd is doing, twisting everything subjective in to negativity. It wouldn't surprise me if half of the &quot;bad writing&quot; crowd hasn't even played through the story of either Legion or early BfA. :D<br />

It more so seems that she doesn’t want to see her self as a slave she wants to keep the image of her being a queen above others where n’zoth doesn’t care if he calls her queen or slave as long as she works for her. So really it’s not bad writing you just don’t get how self centred she is.</div></div><hr />

It's not what happened at all. N'Zoth didn't refer to her as a slave. Just a servant. How she interprets that (and you can as well) is a slave.<br />
<br />
He's not about to let a gifted mage like Azshara slip through his grasp, but he gave her too much information at the start: that he was a prisoner. So he tried to act high and mighty, and she called him out on his bluff.<br />
<br />
And what better way to handle an egomaniac like Azshara than let her think she's in control? Seriously, this &quot;lol blizzard bad writing&quot; thing has become a dumb meme at this point. I criticize a lot of things in the BFA story, but people like you need to stop sperging out about every little bit of lore that seeps out and stepping on it before its given time to breath.</div></div><hr />

Azshara obtained power on her own terms. In a negotiation that is huge. Especially since Blizzard has written her as a master of manipulation. And getting people to think that terms are favorable to them is what manipulators do. Her people serve her. And it's already been discussed that it doesn't seem she is following the orders of any Old god but her own whims. And at this point N'zoths enemies are her enemies anyway. End game N'zoth will get betrayed by Azshara. I doubt we kill her more than &quot;merely a set back&quot; situation.</div></div><hr />

Not much of a queen with no subjects. Don't have to care about them, but you do need them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
N'zoth - I'll make you and your people slaves to rebuild my empire!<br />
<br />
Azshara - No, i'll be a &quot;queen&quot; and i'll give you an army(her people)!<br />
<br />
N'zoth - Isn't that what i just said?...erm nvm, have it your way...<br />
<br />
That's pretty much what happened there. If that's not bad writing, then nothing is.<br />
<br />
for many people the deal was practically the same azshara is being a servant of Nzoth, but I believe that Nzoth was not going to save the people of Azshara after all he has his own army of faceless! I think that with the Azshara deal she saved her people and even though she is a servant of Nzoth, she is also queen of the of Naga.</div></div><hr />

I think she semi cared about her highborn subjects (the rich and born of royal blood types), and smaller group of the overall population. That is probably the ones we saw in the video, I could be wrong though.</div></div><hr />

I saw it as caring about her people as an extension of herself. Without her empire, she is the queen of nothing. The fact that she said she'd use her people to fulfill her bargain with N'zoth expressed her actual opinion on the people as, you know... people.<br />

<br />
And on the record, Blizzard has not outright said Queen Azshara is the raid boss for 8.1 or whatnot. I suspect she might be the mid level raid (8.2), as the naga are a major threat to both continents, while 8.1 will be focused around the Blighted Lands, which are central to Kul Tiras. <br />
<br />
Just a hunch, but we'll see.<br />

It was a play for power. She wanted to rule, she didn't want to serve. She considered herself on equal terms with N'zoth. Whether she actually is remains to be seen. At the very least, she retains her will, and is not consumed with insanity.</div></div><hr />

I think it is more that she Azshara can't be a queen without her people. These were the Highborn who were still loyal to her, while the ancestors of the High Elves had already escaped. <br />
<br />
Also interesting: The terrified and pretty much doomed Highborn(including their children) we see are the result of a victory of the good ones.<br />
<br />
Other than in the other cinematics, Aszhara saved them(out of self-interest). The civilians were allowed to flee from Theramoore, but the fate of most of the civillains of Silvermoon was nicely shown. <br />
<br />
N'Zoth though could have been presented better.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Power is relative. Azshara's personal power is minor compared to N'zoth, or at least was before her transformation (as a naga, it's difficult to say). I meant, though, a play for power as in she wanted to lead, not be an underling. Though, I don't think she was lying when she said that she would rather die a queen, than live as a slave...</div></div><hr />

N'zoth is just playing up an act to convince Azshara to go along with it. The screaming and anger were definitely faked to make her think she was getting a good deal that he didn't want to give. In reality, she'll be his puppet just like her people.<br />

1. The Well of Eternity was done correctly, not some oversized pool like it is wow.<br />

3. The way she tries to save those people, so much better than the book(she could also just be saving herself)<br />
4. N'zoth being that fish the entire time...&quot;The fish know all the secrets. They know the cold. They know the dark.&quot;<br />
5. Her crying about her deal with Sargeras, N'zoth introducing himself to her... so good.<br />
6. N'zoth revealing he's an Old God and his empire, the orgasm she has when seeing it... <br />
7. The Black Empire's architect is cool, this would make an awesome questing area for when his raid comes. I really want to see more of each Old God's city.<br />
8. The way she bargains with him is done really well, this is a person who believed they would be Sargeras' equal and now she's doing the same with an Old God... The balls on this elf are huge.<br />

She wasn't hysterical at all though. She was quite smug and ambitious, the way she's always been portrayed. Jaina deciding to publicly execute all the Sunreavers in Dalaran was an hysterical woman. Sylvanas deciding to burn Teldrassil down because someone said they were grieving for her was an hysterical woman. The most arrogant person known in history telling an Old God &quot;no, you can enslave my people but I'm still the Queen&quot; is not hysterical.</div></div><hr />

<br />
N'zoth is probably the smallest of the 4 named Old Gods, with Y'shaarj being the biggest. Titan size Aman'thul was able to grab him.<br />
We have a canon pic of C'thun's size and comparing it to N'zoth in warbringer, C'thun looks bigger.<br />

All three warbringers characters have existed in Warcraft for years, and it makes absolutely perfect sense to explore their stories right now. Actually try and justify your point<br />
BFA is mostly female characters charged expansion. It is reaching absurd. It doesn't make sense to make all three Warbringers about wamyn. It doesn't make sense to make Jaina Lord Admiral. Put Bitchanji instead of some son they could make. It is all about them gurl powyah yay so that Blizzard can please gov and ngo that they are so 2018.<br />

We have a canon pic of C'thun's size and comparing it to N'zoth in warbringer, C'thun looks bigger.<br />

We've faced YoggSaron and C'thun and reasonable sizes, I'm sure they're make N'zoth tiny aswell.<br />

Those are also reflected at their prime power. We fought ones in cages for thousands of years. Certainly Old Gods by dwindle in size to scope of their current power.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Then... it pleases me to be the first&quot;<br />
<br />
Wrong movie? :p<br />
<br />
Was thinking the same thing.<br />
<br />
OT: The first bit drug a tad and I think it would of helped to have shown the well explode. As it looks to anyone who doesn't know the story that a giant tidal wave came and a queen tried to save her people. She had some bargin in place, but really there is nothing that shows the truth. She looks too good from an outside perspective. Instead, we get the cracking shield and the flopping fish whispering for too long. Could easily have shown her bargain with Sarg (or even just a voice over of it), then a shot to the well exploding, then her &quot;This wasn't the deal line.&quot; a Nice Sarg laugh, maybe a you have your power, then the rest of it.<br />
<br />
N'zoth did his job well and proved once again to be the most cunning. He is only the weakest because his brother nearly killed him during the battle to control Azeroth. He may have recovered while he was in prison. The Titans didn't take his Kingdom, Y'Shaarj did. He was the first to be imprisoned because of this.<br />
<br />
Azashara also doesn't free him, he's been slowly freeing himself for years according to the Shadow Priest Artifact. He's the most cunning by far. He's swayed, used and empowered some of the most powerful being on Azeroth. He's responsible for Deathwing, Al'Akir, Ragnaros and Azshara. To him if she is queen or slave it doesn't matter. She isn't his equal at all, you aren't the equal of someone who gives you part of their power, and he's done this before. <br />
<br />
He's good at giving power to people who will fullfill ideas he wants. War and destruction and to control all of Azeroth. He gave her, her people. That is the trade she gets to rule the Naga and he gets another person willing to do the things he wants, aka help set him free. Without them being slaves. How else do you get people of immense power already to side with you, making them a slave never works, giving them a fake choice does. Letting them retain their ego while doing what you really want without asking is the best manipulation. Did he need her? No, did he want her? Yes. And he got her. He is the king shit manipulator and he's done pretty well with it so far sowing chaos and destruction. He is kind of responsible for some of the worst destruction Azeroth has ever seen.<br />
<br />
His voice was a little bland and overly human. Would have been nice with some whisper/echo effects or overlays.</div></div><hr />

There isn't really a single artist you can credit for this. Sure this short has a lead artist like all the other but the art style and art direction has been pretty consistent with every hand drawn cinematic since the Harbingers series. I don't believe many people have been credited on the Warbringers series so far but we'll probably learn about them through making-offs and art roundups eventually. Who knows, they could do a small panel at Blizzcon.<br />
<br />
In the meantime you can always familiarize yourself with the people who worked on Harbingers and who were no doubt also involved in the development of Warbringers:<br />

Well, no one person has been yet been proven to be an equal to an old god. Even Deathwing ended up just as a pawn and killed after he &quot;won&quot; in the future timeline from &quot;End Time&quot;. <br />
<br />
Even all the old gods we have fought so far were only a fraction of their true power, which was why we have been able to even defeat them.<br />
<br />
N'zoth wants to rebuild his empire and using Azshara to do so. Azshara has once again doomed her people in bargaining with an old god for power, instead this time they are now Naga instead of High Elves.</div></div><hr />

Missing the part about it literally being a caption of part of a city though. It was such a small shot of a small part of Kalimdor as it was at the time, we have no idea if demos were invading there, or if Azshara (considering she went there for a reason) made deals on where they could or couldn't go, it was such a tiny shot.

Dont think that refers to Azshara. She hasn’t died once unless her transformation to what N’zoth gave her counts as her dying and being reborn.<br />

<br />
I believe there was something in Wrath in an Ulduar Questline that talks about &quot;their weakened state.&quot; I always suspected the whole size was an attribute to it.<br />
<br />
But the size of N'Zoth can also be the mind's eye of Azshara herself. Cause I believe his black empire he was flashing off isnt as majestic as she sees it... At least not now, and not when she makes the deal, either. So I always perceived it as the representation of what Azshara is seeing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't think she was thinking of her people out of any form of altruism. Being Queen is a huge part of her identity and you're not a queen without subjects. She made the deal because she doesn't care about the quality of life of her subjects, just that she still has them, that she's still Queen.</div></div><hr />

I think 100% opposite, i hated that nzoth got angry.<br />
Why blizzard decided to write Nzoth like a 3year old having a tantrum is beyond me...<br />
I always viewed all the old gods as cold emotionless manipulating creatures, not like this angry cartoon villain who trumpets his power like some birdcall. <br />
<br />
As for azshara i reacted the same, it was odd seeing her as some noble creature trying to protect her people. It goes 100% against everything we knew of the queen from be4.<br />
<br />
I wish they had made it so that she willingly dropped the shield because of the oldgods promise of power. It whouldve been a much better way of portraying her character. <br />
<br />
And i wish they whould have made nzoths voice as an alluring whisper rather than the angry booming yell he had here.</div></div><hr />

Well remember, N´zoth was the weakest of the old gods for thousand of years. He got stomped by the strongest one , and now that he his finally the last one left, he cant do anything because he is imprisoned. Being weak makes you fear things. And if the theorie is right the fifth old god got eaten before he could even build his empire. Imagine havin to fear day after day for your life because you are the weakest of your kind. But still old gods &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; every mortal. But a mortal reminds him that he is weak/ nothing? no wonder that he got mad</div></div><hr />

i mean, alliance and horde are fighthing each other, and we know resources arent infinity (human, ballistics, materials etc), so in the end of expansion, azshara can attack and probably takeover azeroth to her, so horde and alliance (which are defenseless after all their loss - fighthing each other and n'zoth army) have to go for exile, or be slaves. then it can start a new expansion there, where ally and horde make an alliance between then to take their lands back.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, but the Well went all explodey because she was near it, battling Malfurion as the portal that brought Sargeras to Azeroth collapsed. So it makes no sense that she'd be chilling in her capital ready to save it when the entire Kaldorei empire was aflame in rebellion and demons at this point.</div></div><hr />

I mean, I would've even thought of her saying &quot;fuck, my crown is floating, this is such a bad day for ol'Queen Azshara&quot; or something.<br />
Also, wild theory to keep the Azshara-jerkfest going on... What if Blizzard pulls a &quot;The Sundering also brought up some Azerite, which empowered her even more so she's kind of Old-God level now&quot; kind of excuse - I mean we know that Nzoth is one of the most hyped enemies, but isn't even close to Azshara-level of hype.</div></div><hr />

We raid her next tier<br />
<br />
It was common knowledge i guess, this animated short was mostly for ppl who were un-aware of her background<br />
<br />
It's actually this tier. Uldir is the opening raid like EN was, Aszhara will be the Nighthold raid and the final boss of the opening tier of BFA. Already confirmed before BFA even launched.<br />
<br />
<br />
OT - That was actually amazing. Getting to hear N'zoth finally, get a glimpse of him and seeing Azshara's transformation. It gives me hope that maybe she won't be killed in the raid, and we will get to fight her again.</div></div><hr />

going into technicaly alpha males is not term used by incels but by biologist since its natural in nature that there are alpha/beta/omega male and ofc female types too.<br />

Shame the bad writing police is out in force again today.<br />
<br />
I think the majority of those that complain about bad writing have either never written a piece of fiction in their life, or their writing was rejected earlier in life and they harbor resentment to anyone who's writing is published. I imagine most are the former. They lack the imagination and/or ambition to create their own art and are too lazy to objectively critique someone elses. <br />
<br />
What's worse, it's like reading the first chapter of a story and immediately declaring it shit without any context. It is similar to how people overreacted to Sylvanas's Warbringer without first reading A Good War. With both pieces together you get the full picture and realize not everything was as you first thought. Instead of portraying yourselves as clever critics of the game you actually appear as bitter malcontents who's sole job is to take a shit on anything that anyone else may find appealing. In other words, you just look kind of sad and quite pathetic.</div></div><hr />

I love those last few seconds before she turned naga, pure despair and uncertainty. And she still is a slave to N'zoth, to be used and cast aside when he wants (probably 8.2)</div></div><hr />

They showed nothing we didn't already know. Added absolutely nothing to her story, just your typical cliche villain. So pretty much she will go down being the same bland character she always was.As pro-Azshara as I am, I have to agree with this.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dannihilate</div><div class="date">2018-08-25, 06:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Was thinking the same thing.<br />
<br />
OT: The first bit drug a tad and I think it would of helped to have shown the well explode. As it looks to anyone who doesn't know the story that a giant tidal wave came and a queen tried to save her people. She had some bargin in place, but really there is nothing that shows the truth. She looks too good from an outside perspective. Instead, we get the cracking shield and the flopping fish whispering for too long. Could easily have shown her bargain with Sarg (or even just a voice over of it), then a shot to the well exploding, then her &quot;This wasn't the deal line.&quot; a Nice Sarg laugh, maybe a you have your power, then the rest of it.<br />
<br />
N'zoth did his job well and proved once again to be the most cunning. He is only the weakest because his brother nearly killed him during the battle to control Azeroth. He may have recovered while he was in prison. The Titans didn't take his Kingdom, Y'Shaarj did. He was the first to be imprisoned because of this.<br />
<br />
Azashara also doesn't free him, he's been slowly freeing himself for years according to the Shadow Priest Artifact. He's the most cunning by far. He's swayed, used and empowered some of the most powerful being on Azeroth. He's responsible for Deathwing, Al'Akir, Ragnaros and Azshara. To him if she is queen or slave it doesn't matter. She isn't his equal at all, you aren't the equal of someone who gives you part of their power, and he's done this before. <br />
<br />
He's good at giving power to people who will fullfill ideas he wants. War and destruction and to control all of Azeroth. He gave her, her people. That is the trade she gets to rule the Naga and he gets another person willing to do the things he wants, aka help set him free. Without them being slaves. How else do you get people of immense power already to side with you, making them a slave never works, giving them a fake choice does. Letting them retain their ego while doing what you really want without asking is the best manipulation. Did he need her? No, did he want her? Yes. And he got her. He is the king shit manipulator and he's done pretty well with it so far sowing chaos and destruction. He is kind of responsible for some of the worst destruction Azeroth has ever seen.<br />
<br />
His voice was a little bland and overly human. Would have been nice with some whisper/echo effects or overlays.<br />
<br />
^This. He didn't need her, he could have made the same exact deal with each and every one of the drowning Highborne and gotten his army. But he wanted her and her power, so he manipulated her into thinking she was making the deal on her terms, when in-fact no matter what she did, he wins. <br />
<br />
And there's totally an echo effect at times when he talks, which is really cool and adds a nice layer of creepy to him.</div></div><hr />

I love N'Zoth, if it wasn't creepy and fear inducing I'm not sure what Blizzard can do. As the fish before he reveals himself to Azshara reminds me of horror films where something so basic is made evil. If anyone has seen The Witch they probably know what I mean. Also the music and sound was great. The screeching horror tones to the drumming, the change of colour from dark to light was really vivd and even Azshara was impressed by N'Zoth.<br />
<br />
The transformation looked painful. I saw it somewhere where the iris around Azshara looked like a foetus during her rebirth. But it also but N'Zoth to a scale to say he's stupidly huge. I felt it worked a lot better than the Sylvanas one. Can't wait to see what happens next with N'Zoth mainly :D</div></div><hr />

now if you would use term like jocks/chads i would understand by alpha ? thats something that every man should aspire to be.<br />
<br />
Except this whole idea has been proven multiple times to be utter garbage and completely untrue?<br />

Besides - the &quot;alpha male&quot; of a wolfpack isn't the &quot;manliest&quot; but the eldest, ie. the most experienced.</div></div><hr />

You are obviously incel and/or an emotional contrarian - you keep defending your nonsense even though you have been clearly corrected with facts and information about this expansion.<br />
Ah, incel, one year ago I would be called a mgtow, tw, maybe just a mysoginist. Times change. Sure, you can post a list of minor characters and claim their importance. Let's combat panering.<br />
<br />
If you need to talk to someone, I'm here for you. I'm by no means a licensed therapist, but if what you're typing is truly how you feel and you aren't trolling/charading, I do want to at least listen to you Fetus Rex. I've seen you post across the forum with this kinda sour misogynistic attitude. I understand, please know I do. A good friend of mine always struggled with socializing with women, before turning toward the incel counterculture, before turning on himself. <br />
<br />
I say this in true modesty man. Feeling shunned by the opposite gender is, at our core survival instincts, the worst thing our brains can endure. Because you also get shunned by other men, the &quot;Chads/Alphas&quot; as the incels call them. It only gets worse from here, so just send me a message some time, why you feel this way or why you feel attacked by strong female lead characters. I am a soon to be daddy with a stunning fiancé, and in high school struggled hard with women. I self-helped, you can too.<br />
The problem is that I have never had a problem with socializing with women, quite the opposite. Even the best pink tinted glasses will shatter one day.<br />
<br />
I wonder, how long will it take for you to arrive at the same conclusion.</div></div><hr />

I just want you to be happy Internet stranger. If you need a friend, not everyone on this site are jerks and snobs. I will gladly listen to whatever you'd like to get off your chest unbiased. Hating 51% of the human race is no way to live or love. <br />
<br />
I'm not berating you or speaking down to you, I just personally think it sounds like you need a friend right now.</div></div><hr />

Happiness is overrated. Why would I hate them? It is men who continue this pandering to get better scores from certain groups. <br />
<br />
I have a friend, but thank you for the offer. And I wish you the best during inevitable divorce. Remember, collect information on all of your future wives misdeeds. Don't tell her, never threaten her with what you have collected. Just keep it. I know, love, honesty and all that bullshit, it clouds the judgement. But do this for yourself. Keep tabs or you might end up with no visitations one day and your kid will see you as a monster. And no, it did not happen to me. Just be wary of your sorroundings.</div></div><hr />

Bwonsamdi &gt;&gt; NZoth at making deals<br />
<br />
LUL<br />
<br />
Might be the same guy in the end...or maybe Bwonsamdi works for NZoth or sells his deals to him. Bwonsamdi is currently more interesting tho. NZoth is just another old god to kill...</div></div><hr />

<br />
I know right? I mean, she's a narcissistic b*tch and she sold her people twice but... I still love her character. She has this Cersei Lannister vibe about her, you hate her but you love to hate her and even though you know she's morally unforgivable, she is still fascinating. With this kind of character, you always want to see more.<br />

For some reason, I don't feel like this for Sylvanas. :/</div></div><hr />

<br />
No I get that. But the post I commented on said she would be a Nighthold boss, but then the person also said she would be the end-boss for BFA expansion as a whole? That was confusing.</div></div><hr />
