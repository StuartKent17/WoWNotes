Achievements<br />
<br />
Fixed an issue that prevented players who learned the Flopping Fish (https://www.wowdb.com/items/170203-flopping-fish) toy from receiving credit for the achievement Give Me the Biggest Bag You've Got (https://www.wowdb.com/achievements/13692-give-me-the-biggest-bag-youve-got).<br />
<br />
<br />
Dungeons and Raids<br />
<br />
Azshara’s Eternal Palace<br />
<br />
Fixed an issue where Charged Spear (https://www.wowdb.com/spells/298425-charged-spear) could target victims of Devotion (https://www.wowdb.com/spells/300001-devotion) or Army of Azshara (https://www.wowdb.com/spells/306177-army-of-azshara) in all difficulties.<br />
Fixed an issue that caused Queen Azshara to rapidly change which way she faced in Mythic difficulty.<br />
<br />
Operation: Mechagon<br />
<br />
Reduced the damage from Furnace Flames (https://www.wowdb.com/spells/301876-furnace-flames) by 20%.<br />
Throwing Robo-Waste into the furnace now removes all stacks of Noxious Stench (https://www.wowdb.com/spells/301850-noxious-stench).<br />
Reduced the spawn time between Robo-Waste drops to 12 seconds (was 15 seconds).<br />
Players were attempting to defeat K.U.-J.O. on Hard Mode difficulty with full stacks of Noxious Stench (https://www.wowdb.com/spells/301850-noxious-stench). The intention is that players should be cleaning up K.U.-J.O.'s Robo-Waste periodically. These changes are to encourage that behavior.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Items<br />
<br />
Reduced the damage players take from Scrap Trap (https://www.wowdb.com/items/167046-scrap-trap) in Mechagon.<br />
Fixed an issue where using the Aqueous Reliquary (https://www.wowdb.com/items/169694-aqueous-reliquary) or Focused Life Anima (https://www.wowdb.com/items/169491-focused-life-anima) with enough items would sometimes fail to create an Essence.<br />
Heart of Azeroth<br />
<br />
Fixed an issue with Purification Protocol (https://www.wowdb.com/spells/299346-purification-protocol) (Essence) that sometimes prevented players from gaining the damage bonus from the Rank 3 Major Slot effect.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Player versus Player<br />
<br />
Items<br />
<br />
Leviathan's Lure (https://www.wowdb.com/items/169304-leviathans-lure) now deals 50% damage against players in PvP situations.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Quests<br />
<br />
“Heroic Warfront: The Battle for Stromgarde (https://www.wowdb.com/quests/56136-heroic-warfront-the-battle-for-stromgarde)” is no longer removed from the quest log when the Warfront is no longer active for the player.<br />
Quests with objectives in Stormwind no longer direct players to Deeprun Tram from Ironforge.<br />
<br />

<br />
Eurogamer WoW Classic Interview<br />
Eurogamer (https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-07-29-a-big-wow-classic-interview-in-the-lead-up-to-launch) sat down with lead software engineer Ryan Birmingham and senior software engineer Omar Gonzalez to discuss the nearing release of WoW Classic!<br />
<br />
<br />
https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2019/july/thumb/eurgamerclassicinterview.jpg (https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-07-29-a-big-wow-classic-interview-in-the-lead-up-to-launch)<br />
<br />
<br />
Classic Beta Server Shutdown Event<br />
<br />
One of the live-ops producers came up with the idea to spawn Ragnaros in Stormwind during the beta.<br />
They wanted to have some throwbacks to the original beta for WoW and that is why they did a lot of crazy things during beta for Classic.<br />
One idea was also giving everyone Thunderfury as drops that they could pick up just before the beta went down.<br />
<br />
Beta Feedback and Challenges<br />
<br />
If a boss is three levels higher than you, it ignores your first 1% bonus to hit, so it's 8% chance to miss, and your first point of +1% chance to hit is totally ignored. This was an example of something from the original game that people forgot.<br />
Some beta testers sat for hours over weekends punching turtles to generate thousands of combat log entries to help with an issue on crit percentage. They love the community devotion.<br />
The team has a little internal pool going around the office for how long it will take for the first Ragnaros kill after launch.<br />
The team was blown away by the passion shown from beta testers. They expected people to come in and try things for a small amount of time, but people were playing for long hours night after night even though they knew these characters were going to be wiped eventually.<br />
The layering population thresholds were lower on the beta than for actual launch because they were testing the tech to make sure it was working correctly.<br />
There have been a lot of changes that they had to undo so hunter gameplay was accurate to how it originally was - not just in combat mechanics but movement aesthetics and animation.<br />
From now until launch, the team is focusing on addressing and correcting bugs found during the Beta, particularly the most impactful and obvious bugs.<br />
<br />
Login Queues<br />
<br />
The goal is to avoid having login queues on launch day. The team is making their best guesses for participation and making sure that they have plans in place for potential issues. If players exceed their expectations then there will be queues until they can fix something.<br />
The team is better prepared to respond to the login queue situation than they were back in 2004. They expect queues to only be an issue on launch day if at all.<br />
The team will have a &quot;war-room&quot; on launch day to address issues. The Classic Launch is similar to an expansion launch, except it will include new infrastructure that they typically don't do for an expansion.<br />
Classic launch will include hardware deploys in all of the various regions - something they haven't done in almost 15 years.<br />
Classic Launch will be &quot;all hands on deck&quot; and the whole WoW team is lending a hand.<br />
<br />
Gold Farming and Botting Issues<br />
<br />
The team has plans in place to address gold farming issues, particularly botting. They have better detection algorithms and techniques today than before, so they hope that will be sufficient to keep it under control.<br />
<br />
Release Phases<br />
<br />
There are now six phases post launch instead of four.<br />
<br />
Phase 1 - Launch, Ragnaros and Onyxia will be available.<br />
Phase 2 - Dire Maul and the PvP Honor System - you'll be able to kill people in the world during phase one but there won't be an Honor system tracking it.<br />
Phase 3 - Alterac Valley and Warsong Gulch Battlegrounds, Blackwing Lair.<br />
Phase 4 - Arathi Basin Battleground, Zul'Gurub, and the green dragon world bosses.<br />
Phase 5 - Ahn'Qiraj.<br />
Phase 6 - Naxxramas.<br />
<br />
They changed the phases because community feedback said four was too few, and there were distinct periods of time that they wanted to recapture.<br />
<br />
For example, people were concerned that getting battleground reputation rewards too early would make it trivial to go through Molten Core and Onyxia.<br />
<br />
<br />
The Future<br />
<br />
The team is devoted to making WoW Classic as authentic of an experience as possible and are not ready to discuss the future quite yet.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Blizzard No Longer Manufactures Physical Authenticators<br />
Blizzard clarified that they no longer manufacture physical authenticators, yet they still support them!<br />
I’ve been searching all over the place, and I can’t see a place where it says that these have been discontinued. But the link to the store where they used to sell them is just a 404 now.<br />
<br />
So, does Blizzard no longer provide hardware authentication? I’m starting to make the move away from phone apps and into authentication hardware like a yubikey.<br />
We no longer manufacture, or offer physical authenticators. Sorry!<br />
<br />
Wow…ok that is totally unexpected!<br />
<br />
I still have mine. I assume it will be supported as long as the battery lasts. Is that the case? I really really dislike phone apps.<br />
Yes, they’re still supported just no longer manufactured.<br />
<br />
<br />
Goblin and Worgen Updated Model Preview<br />
With the release of the 8.2.5 PTR happening very soon, we figured it would be a good time to remind people what was shown at Blizzcon 2018 for the Goblin and Worgen model updates. The pictures below were early views of what to expect, and the latest development notes (https://www.mmo-champion.com/content/8657-Patch-8-2-5-PTR-Development-Notes) also state that the animations were updated as well. In an interview around Blizzcon it was also stated that female Worgen would have glowing eyes as an option, and that these two races are the next to receive their heritage armor!<br />
<br />

Yeah same, and it didn't seem particularly hard. The difficulty was what we expected for hardmode, funny to see it's meant to be easier.</div></div><hr />

It means that they not only unlock new content, but do that on entirely new hardware, since these servers are new, simultaneously over the entire world.</div></div><hr />

Yeah. Indd. I dont care about the models as Long as the game is fun/good and have rewarding progress (not tmogs, races, Mounts, pets etc..).</div></div><hr />

Actual physical servers for classic? Seems pretty obvious that they would want to deploy servers worldwide so not everyone has to join the servers of one continent.</div></div><hr />

All these arguments of a better MMORPG are nonsense, sorry.<br />
It's just a better game now with more features and better graphics and a true sense of roleplaying when you can mog every look you want to play exactly this toon also in combat.<br />
Also most of the specs were crap in classic</div></div><hr />

<br />
Even if that was the case, which it isn't, who are you to tell people how to enjoy their game.<br />
<br />
The real problem with WOW, and the MMO-Champ &quot;community&quot; specifically, is sour people trying to dictate and judge others how to enjoy their game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It was designed like that to begin with - for you to need to reset your stacks by clicking on the waste and hiding behind the box when it went in the furnace. Only it broke and didn't work anymore.<br />
<br />
Whether it's harder or easier with that design doesn't matter so much. My guess is we'll keep ignoring it because it seems easier without it, especially since we're getting better and better gear and the dog dies faster.<br />

<br />
You're also a prime example of the playerbase. Bitching about others when their interest doesn't align with yours and feeling superior to others because of said interest. As a note, the article mentions models so people discuss what the article says... not sure why you feel the need to go all holy.</div></div><hr />

Tiny bit skeptical if they make it have too much of a gold color to it, i saw something said a while back that it will resemble gold/money/wealth or something? cant find the dam post though and sure i didnt dream that up. Maybe someone else knows more about that but for me gold aint my go to color so hopefully its not in ya face ott too much :P</div></div><hr />

Excuse me, but... who are you to judge and assume that it is all that matters? It's so ignorant. So if there was a mention on how one or another talent worked in classic and Classic players would be discussing that under the post, that would be all that matters? I don't think so. It would be in the topic, because it was mentioned.</div></div><hr />

That's a shame. But updated animations were a must, the females especially haven't exactly been lavished with praise for their animations in the past 9 years. <br />

You're free to be the typical salty little screecher because you can't stand seeing buzz of any kind about current WoW (more buzz on the updated 9 year old models than Classic, LOL!) but you thinking the game is all about Transmog, races and mounts because it's discussed in a topic specifically focusing on those things, says more about you than the real playerbase. <br />
<br />
Have fun in Classic, although I suspect it'll just be a few weeks at most before your crowd is back on forums whining about something or another. My bet is that the initial flow of waaaaah will be about how the devs fucked up on something because lil' Peter doesn't feel exactly the same way in Classic 2019 as he did in 2004.</div></div><hr />

Legion and BfA are not bad and not boring, but they lack the nostalgia that classic has (and that is logical).<br />
Do most expect a 15 year old game to have the same charm as in the beginning?<br />
If that is their way of seeing things...….Goodluck with their real life relationships then. Always looking for the first year (or even 2 montsh) to be in love with butterflies.<br />
<br />
I leveled many, many, many toons and alts. Believe me, questing in Wod, Legion and BfA is an upgrade of the game.<br />

The real problem with WoW is that it tries to cater to such a wide audience that it built a playerbase with polar opposite tastes in most aspects of the game, and now fails to provide a trully meaningful and fun experience to a lot of those people because they try to please everyone instead of picking one design direction and sticking with it.<br />

&quot;The real problem&quot;...<br />
<br />
They don't break records in sales on a 15 year old title through not providing meaningful and fun experiences to their customers. That'd be an amazing feat considering how spoiled players are with options these days.<br />
<br />
One design direction literally killed Wildstar. WoW's design direction changing from MoP onward, with a regression during WOD which painted a clear picture, is what'll allow it to stick around for another 15 years.<br />

I miss my Cataclysm authenticator. The one I bought 3 years ago still goes strong though, so here's hoping. If you don't do what I did (allowed a hamster to chew the button to smithereens) you should be fine.</div></div><hr />

Shouldn't be that surprising, that was what original WoW did, it got people hooked.<br />

All these arguments of a better MMORPG are nonsense, sorry.<br />
It's just a better game now with more features and better graphics and a true sense of roleplaying when you can mog every look you want to play exactly this toon also in combat.<br />
Also most of the specs were crap in classic<br />

Better game from a production value perspective, garbage MMORPG in comparison. BFA and Classic are vastly different types games and can barely be compared anymore.</div></div><hr />

Yeah well. That classic stuff is just too noisy for me. Yes it's an opinion. But as I said, I've played it from 0-100 so I can surely say that features, talents, usable class specs and ofc visuals are much worse in terms of less or in terms of just older. That's a fact.<br />
You can really just play a bunch of specs. But you will see...</div></div><hr />

lol the irony is so strong... you are actually the wrong one. Any objective criteria shows the game being better now. You may subjectively prefere vanilla. Snd that’s fine. But that is your opinion. You are the one who can’t separate objectivity, the game being better on every mesurable aspect, and subjectivity, you prefering old wow for whatever reason.<br />
<br />
Its just like vintage car aficionados. They love old cars. But it would still be retarded to call them « better cars than today’s one ». You may prefere your old vintage game, but it doesnt make it better. It’s just you liking old things.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sales &quot;records&quot; are highly debatable, since the supposed increase is much more likely the result of how they look at the data and changes in buying habits (ie looking at pre-orders and first day or first week sales only, and not at total sales and engagement throughout an expansion). Also, box sales being higher, or high, just mean people are interested in the idea of WoW, it doesn't mean they actually enjoy it or have fun when they actually get to it. I'd argue WoW makes more sales from having created millions of people addicted to it (and giving every new expansion a try in the hope of recapturing that gameplay feeling) than from actually being an amazing MMORPG or Multiplayer ARPG for that matter =P.<br />
<br />
Regardless, notice the &quot;trully&quot; before &quot;meaningful and fun experience&quot;. I don't mean that there are no people having fun, obviously there are, and thankfully there will continue to be. And I'm glad for them. But it's just an objective fact that the game is worse as a whole when it tries to do multiple contradicting things at the same time; it just ends up not excelling at either, even if it provides an ok experience at both - it just takes a quick look at the forums to realize this. If the audience is too wide, you pretty much can't please a big chunk of the audience without displeasing a big chunk as well.<br />
<br />
<br />
Highly doubt Wildstar died beacuse of having one design direction. I would in fact wager that it was much more harmed from the features and systems that did not match that main design direction (ie the queueing system and how the end-game content worked). And even assuming it did die because of the design direction, it died because of *that* design direction, not specifically because of having just one.<br />

<br />
That's not entirely true, depending on how you look at it. If you evaluate both as &quot;games&quot;, then sure. BfA is objectively better, if not by design at least in all the gameplay and technological improvements made ofter 15 years. At least if you look at them in a vaccuum and exclude the fact they exist in two very different contexts (2004 vs 2019).<br />
<br />
But if you look at both as &quot;MMORPG&quot;, there's a lot to argue that Vanilla was indeed better, at the very least design wise. Simply because WoW today is closer to an Action RPG with optional Multiplayer than it is to an MMORPG. I think a lot of what Vanilla does better than today's WoW as an MMORPG should be clear to anyone who's been following the reception to Classic and its Beta.</div></div><hr />
