you got mana back from tiger palm and blackout kick ONLY after you jab once. Its somehow a nerf instead...</div></div><hr />

I guess overall I like it better.<br />
<br />
Edit: just saw the increase mana cost to jab and that makes me a sad panda.</div></div><hr />

Alright, I was kind of hoping to see something that involves Shaman's single target DPS. Thanks nonetheless. Appreciate it.</div></div><hr />

Where do you get this ''Blacksmithing mount'' thing from? The Sky Claw has always been listed as an Engineering mount.</div></div><hr />

These are tooltip changes, thats all they are for arcane. The changes went through last week. People whining about arcane still fail, fire is quickly becoming the spec in 5.2 and will do much more dmg than arcane then people will cry over fire.</div></div><hr />

The helm gives off a wration vibe...maybe part of the legendary quest somehow?</div></div><hr />

The eyes maybe. And the music on the background. But the model itself does not give me a &quot;last of the black dragonflight&quot; vibe.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And Affliction has 100% mobile dps. It's absurd. And they've already eliminated one of the core reasons Arcane is parsing so highly right now (scorch weaving).</div></div><hr />

First you have Fire which was OP so they gave your arcane. Then arcane was OP and now they are nerfing that. There will always be a competitive mage spec in PvE (maybe not top but I don't know if there has ever been a time mages were on the flat out bottom and benched regularly). There is never any significant time before between OP mage specs and im sure that trend will continue.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Arena and Rated Battleground Season 12 is scheduled to end on Tuesday, March 5. At that point, we will determine who is eligible for the end-of-season rewards, a process that should take approximately one week. It's very important for players who feel that they may be eligible for Arena titles and/or the Malevolent Gladiator's Cloud Serpent to refrain from transferring their characters to another realm or faction until after Season 12 ends. The awarding of Season 12 titles and mounts will occur approximately 2 weeks after the season ends.<br />
<br />
At the end of the season, Conquest Points will be converted to Honor Points and any honor above 4000 will be converted to gold at a rate of 35 silver per point. The honor cap will remain at 4000.<br />
<br />
All Season 12 items will cost Honor Points (equivalent to their previous Conquest Point cost) when the season ends, with the exception of any items with rating requirements attached. These items will no longer be available for purchase.<br />
<br />
The next Arena and Rated Battleground season will begin approximately one week after the current season ends. During the break between seasons, all Rated Battleground and Arena matches will be unavailable. Team and Personal Ratings will be reset when Season 13 begins.</div></div><hr />

My alt is a mage and even i think there op as hell. Mine has a 482 ilevel and i was doing 130k dps tonight lol and that wasn't with the scorch rotation which i don't use cause i couldn't get use to it.<br />
When i hit a 745k arcane barrage i realized then why there getting hit hard with the nerfbat. :/</div></div><hr />

Why not craft wand at high level, or a mount even like most other professions have? Personally i like the idea of getting a personal enchant that is temporary and equivalent to flasks. Make it cost enchanting mats and enchanters can essentially self buff instead of using a flask.</div></div><hr />
