WoWTal.com Updated to Build 12857<br />
Had a few hiccups with the latest build because of the server migration but the cataclysm talent calculator (http://www.wowtal.com/) is now updated to the latest beta build.<br />

New Race Introduction Cinematics<br />
TotalBiscuit compiled all the new introduction cinematics added to the game in the latest beta build. All races character creation cinematics have been updated to reflect all the recent changes to the lore, including upcoming changes, and you might want to check them out.<br />

<br />
Cataclysm Glyphs<br />
Prime glyphs aren't going to be exciting in a &quot;change up your rotation&quot; style. We want primes to be unambiguous dps (etc.) increases so we figured they might as well be easy to understand rather than something so convoluted that everyone would just go to a fansite to see which 3 to pick.<br />
<br />
The majors are more interesting, because they are either not dps increases at all, or dps increases in ways that are tricky to math out. We think players will debate and geek out more about which majors to use, and with the new glyph design, swapping them out once in awhile isn't very painful.<br />
<br />
Minors are basically convenience or fun.<br />
<br />
We don't want glyphs to change rotations. We feel that was a mistake in LK. Talents should affect your rotations, and glyphs should just provide a little bit of customization and power. We fixed some class problems with glyphs in LK, which was an easy solution to do at the time, but now is the time to undo all of that and let the classes stand on their own without the glyphs. <br />
<br />
I'm not sure I agree with this. I can understand wanting to keep it simple, but like someone else said, if you're going to have 3 glyphs that we're always going to have with no variation, and none of them have any effect on the rotation... couldn't we just stick with minor/major glyphs, and just remove the prime glyphs entirely? <br />
<br />
First, it would be a weird world in which a warrior say could glyph Charge and Battle Shout but not Mortal Strike. It might make sense to savvy players who thought through it, but I'd wager you'd also see a lot of &quot;Why don't they make glyphs that affect the buttons I care most about? Blizzard is dumb.&quot; (And to be clear, the point of that is not to defend ourselves against agitated forum posters, but that if something in the game is confusing like that in can get in the way of having fun.)<br />
<br />
Second, gaining power when you level up is fun. Hitting a milestone where you get a noticeable damage bonus is fun. There is also some mildly interesting decisions about which prime glyph to use first. In other words, don't view everything through the lens of the maximum level player.<br />
<br />
Third, not everything in the game needs to be a nail-biting decision. We don't for example really want Fury warriors to stress about whether to choose Raging Blow or not, nor we do we make it particularly challenging to choose your weapon enchant. Sometimes easy decisions make players feel more comfortable rather than every potential decision having a host of invisible pitfalls. This isn't an issue of catering to the dumb players -- it's more about there being a few safe places in the game. [I feel nearly certain after re-reading that paragraph that it's going to be hard to understand and I will end up having to clarify it for months to come.]<br />
<br />
Finally, I'd argue that the popular glyphs on live today already were the no brainers because in most cases they led to a consistent dps increase (for dps specs of course). When everyone uses those glyphs, then you aren't making some interesting decision about how to use your abilities -- you're just doing what every other warrior out there is doing. The only way to deviate from that is to have two glyphs that affect your primary abilities in two totally different but equal ways. That's a very tall order, because more than likely we'll end up having to constantly adjust around that. &quot;Encounter #4 in Grim Batol is unfair to warriors who use the Glyph of Furious Mortal Strikes instead of the Glyph of Meaty Mortal Strikes.&quot; What I mean is that we end up having to support multiple play styles within one tree. We're willing to do that to a limited extent (the TG vs. SMF Fury warrior for example, or the FFB mage), but it's hard enough to develop 1-2 viable rotations per spec. We don't want every important glyph bifurcating that rotation even more. <br />

Your ICC gear is going away in Uldum (LVL 84-85)<br />
What gear? Uldum has zero quest rewards and the creatures are not itemized. When Uldum is itemized every single quest should offer you an upgrade, regardless of what gear you have from ICC+. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26560771384/feedback-twilight-highlands/))<br />

Paladin Glyphs<br />
That Avenging Wrath glyph no longer exists. It's far too obvious a dps increase to be a major under the new paradigm.<br />
<br />
The Seal of Truth one is on the bubble. It's still in for now, but it's pretty much a no-brainer given the stat savings it offers. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26723612447/paladin-glyphs-on-beta-right-now/))<br />
<br />
Selfless Healer<br />
We're fine with Selfless Healer. It's not going anywhere. We are slightly sympathetic to the concern that the opportunity cost is too high given that you're giving up a Templar's Verdict and that's the kind of thing we might mess with. However, if the idea of having a talent focused solely on healing (and not self preservation) offends you, then skip the talent. It's intended to be optional. There are paladins out there who like the concept of being able to help out healing in a 5-player dungeon or like being able to save lives once in awhile, and the talent is aimed at them.

Warrior Glyphs<br />
Some of those glyphs don't look correct. Colossus Smash is a major. Hamstring doesn't do that anymore. Shield Wall provides 60% damage reduction but on a longer cooldown. That's just off the top of my head. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26560867318/new-warrior-discussion-build-12857/))</div></div><hr />

<br />
Unless, of course, Blizzard find it a nightmare to change or update trees due to dependencies &amp; balancing and therefore want to experiment placing as much flat power in one easily tweakable set of items. In which case, why didn't they just come out and say that instead?</div></div><hr />

I still think you need to investigate your cpl (characters per line) a bit. Your line lengths are still difficult to read in the new design. In the existing and new design you're forcing a lot of work out of the macula in the eye as well as our neck muscles.</div></div><hr />

nor we do we make it particularly challenging to choose your weapon enchant.<br />

I know weapon enchants were not the point of the discussion, but I'm sure I'm not the only one that wishes there was some choice in weapon enchant. I want a choice if only for the fact that it is visually represented on the character.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also, I'm not loving the new Holy Paladin trees. I don't like taking filler talents and I'm not sure if it's a good or bad sign when the tree has literally run out of talents that interest me for PvE before the 31 point mark. I've made trees for a few other classes and specs and noticed having to choose talents I don't even want in order to move forward in the tree is very rare, and usually only with dps.<br />

Variable or fixed width? Doesn't look like it's a standard 960 wide site so I'm guessing variable with CSS. It does however make the content area look rather forced and bare. Not a big fan.<br />

Doctor Silverman! Yesss haha how awesome is it that Blizz chose his voice for the intros XD As a huge fan of the Terminator franchise, I just had an epic nerdgasm.<br />

<br />
The intros are using the in-game engine. So any choppiness you saw in the intros were due to the system they were rendered on. I noticed mountains in TB that appeared a few seconds after it started. That is not surprising. Some of the statues missing in Stormwind might but intentional Cataclysm changes but I can't say for certain as I am not in the Beta.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is more to do with the fact that the game is streaming content for some reason. The framerate was fine, a solid 30 the entire time during recording, the actual movement was somewhat jerky due to engine issues. That will not happen in the final version since you shouldn't be streaming that content, it should all be downloaded</div></div><hr />

<br />
As for the new site, I like it. It manages to be familiar while at the same time changing what needs to be changed. I can take or leave the warrior guy at the top; TBH, I ignored this site for the first few months of playing WoW because I saw that, and assumed the site was some sort of anime/MMO site(lol, you know what happens when you assume....).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Of course when you consider that those items that you put so much effort into obtaining make you &quot;gimp&quot; only a few levels later, it does make you question why you put so much effort into obtaining them in the first place. In TBC and Wrath, if you had the best raid gear, you didn't replace a lot of it until at the very least, max level dungeons and/or the &quot;starter&quot; raid. With Cata it's like you're not even allowed to enjoy it that long. They should tone down the quest gear and tone down the mobs. If people who have full ICC gear can blow through the questing pretty easily, who cares? clearly those players are the type who will stick around for the raids, so what's the big loss?<br />

Not sure I'm really grokking the Prime Glyphs from a design stand-point.... kinda seems odd to be pushing such a passive form of upgrades when they've just spent the last several months in beta doing the exact opposite with talents because they found them dull. :confused: Maybe it'll make more sense in context.<br />
.<br />
<br />
What I find interesting is the &quot;We're okay with it not being much of a choice, just like with weapon enchants.&quot; Didn't they straight up remove the +stamina weapon enchant that was supposed to be in patch 3.1 because they decided it would just become the default/required tanking enchant, rather than providing a real choice? For DPS casters they finally got Black Magic to a point where it was a reasonable choice in place of raw spell power, got a number of viable melee DPS enchants... and now that they know how to do it their philosophy is &quot;It doesn't matter, just use the default weapon enchant&quot; ?<br />
<br />
P.S.-- I know Adys doesn't care for my &quot;tone,&quot; and maybe it's just a Chrome thing, but I get constant pop ups in the middle of my screen. Take a survey, take another damn survey, etc. It's not a &quot;bad ad&quot; it's a new way of advertising that is normally reserved for low class porn sites and never happened before today.</div></div><hr />

It's not that i hate the design, i just hate changing things that proved themselves to be &quot;working&quot;.<br />

<br />
Meh, if everyone operated on the saying &quot;If it's not broke, don't fix it&quot; we'd never have any kind of innovation or creativity. I like the new design save a few small changes here and there. As long as the functionality is there like it is presently, i can see the design change going over very smoothly.</div></div><hr />

If that makes you want to off yourself, I'm astounded you've made it this long.<br />
<br />
On another note, I sincerely hope the starting quests have changed more than appearances would lead one to believe. The Orc, Forsaken, and Blood Elf starting areas look almost--if not exactly--the same.</div></div><hr />

The &quot;kill x wolves&quot; quests are still there. They've just taken out quests that are no longer relevant and changed up the gnome/trolls to reflect their new starting zones. <br />
<br />
They aren't getting rid of every old quest, a lot of them have simply been moved. Only areas that have been really overhauled graphically (ie a lake where grass used to be) are getting a lot of new quests.</div></div><hr />

Please do not post spoilers. I assume you are refering to the videos. I didn't want to watch them since it had spoiler alerts above it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think 17&quot; and up supports it pretty well. I currenly use a 21&quot; monitor and works perfect. I also believe everything up 21&quot; has 1920x1080 resolutions.<br />
<br />
Oh btw - LOVE the new layout! I find it even more simple than the current one so I doubt people will have much trouble navigating through, even though it's new. Very clean and subtle. Good job.<br />

I'd assume it's Lorem Ipsum. I might be wrong though.</div></div><hr />

Why don't you just refrain from reading to comment section if you're so adamant about not reading spoilers? it's purpose is to allow people to make comments on what was in the post, so if there's spoilers in the post then there's going to be spoilers in the comments.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">catalystical</div><div class="date">2010-09-05, 02:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;Second, gaining power when you level up is fun. Hitting a milestone where you get a noticeable damage bonus is fun. There is also some mildly interesting decisions about which prime glyph to use first. In other words, don't view everything through the lens of the maximum level player.&quot;<br />
<br />
Let's face it. Every player knows the game truly starts at max level. As much as they want to freshen up the leveling process, the end game is well... the end game. <br />
<br />
There will be a small bunch of people (me) who just enjoys the grindfest and level characters up to 80(5) and dumping them to one side to work on another, but for the rest of the gaming population it's mainly 1 character they log in at nights to raid with, maybe with alts for the weekends.<br />
<br />
One might thought when they opened up raiding to the mass population in Wrath, they know raiding is the end game where not only the phat loots are, but also where major plot points will be concluded.<br />
<br />
&quot;In other words, don't view everything through the lens of the maximum level player&quot; has got to be one of the most out of touch comments GC has given out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The searchfield is badly located. It looks messy and shouldn't be there. I would have placed it to the right just below the &quot;Cataclysm&quot; and &quot;Patch 3.3&quot; buttons.<br />
Also images in posts should not be centered, they should be aligned to the left. It's a typographical thing.</div></div><hr />
