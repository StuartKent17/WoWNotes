<br />
Affliction<br />
<br />
Corruption and Agony damage reduced 6%<br />
Unstable Affliction damage reduced 4%<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Dungeons and Raids<br />
<br />
Antorus, the Burning Throne<br />
<br />
Coven of Shivarra<br />
<br />
Corrected an issue that caused the health of Torments to not properly scale with raid size.<br />
<br />
Eonar the Life-Binder<br />
<br />
Players who are disconnected during the Eonar encounter will have access to Surge of Life once they reconnect.<br />
<br />

<br />

Carafe of Searing Light now correctly shares a short cooldown with other &quot;Use&quot; trinkets.<br />
Convergence of Fates primary stat increased by 13%. Effect reduced to 3 seconds of cooldown reduction (was 4 seconds).<br />
<br />
Developers’ notes: This change is aimed at changing how Convergence of Fate scales with item level – or rather, how it doesn’t. For some specializations, the cooldown reduction effect is so powerful that the item level of the trinket is all but irrelevant. We’re shifting more of the item’s power to primary stat and less in the base proc to cause the trinket’s scaling with item level to be more similar to other trinkets in Legion.<br />
<br />
Forgefiend's Fabricator damage increased by 25%.<br />

Probably because 25.5% of guilds who killed Heroic Garothi also killed Argus within the first week, while only 9.6% of guilds who killed Heroic Goroth also killed KJ within the first week.<br />
<br />
<br />
Argus was severely undertuned. To the point where decent groups were literally killing him with pugs within &lt;20 pulls. I'd say Coven was much harder than Argus and even that was pretty faceroll with 3 tanks.</div></div><hr />

You can remove the downtime caused by immunity completely, which ends up being an overall increase in dmg even with the extra tank<br />
<br />
<br />
Shadow/Ice: swap on every ice cast<br />
Shadow/Fire: 2 tanks + 1 healer handle fire while everyone ones hammers on shadow the entire time<br />
Fire/Ice: 2 tanks + 1 healer on fire again. You need either a pally Hand of Freedom himself/the tank or put a BDK on ice to AMS the stacks off.</div></div><hr />

Well, they should remove the gear, achievements, and mounts obtained on week one, then. Since they won't, buffing him after the fact is complete BS.</div></div><hr />

<br />
... Why? It's not the players' faults that Argus was undertuned. They did the content without exploit, and they did it fairly easier than what Blizz intended. Thus Blizz decided that they thought Argus should be buffed. Just because you couldn't couldn't get your toy when it was on sale doesn't mean Blizz should take the toys away from those who put in the effort to get it while it was on sale.<br />
<br />
Hell, even with the buff it's not too difficult. We 2-shot it last night, and that was with a few initiates who hadn't done him yet. With more and more people 945+ upgraded gear, 75 traits, and tier sets, the buffs are basically negated.</div></div><hr />
