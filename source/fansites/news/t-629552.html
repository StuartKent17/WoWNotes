Please keep in mind that restrictions still apply to new, non-transfer realms such that death knights cannot be created on those realms until you level a character to level 55 on that realm or until transfer restrictions are removed. For any players considering creating a new death knight, we wanted to give an early heads-up, in case you wished to create a new death knight on a realm other than the one where your characters currently reside.<br />

Tanking classes<br />
We have four tank classes, and we want them to be roughly equal. I say &quot;roughly&quot; because I don't realistically think with different abilities and mechanics that their survivability, dps and threat generation are going to be identical in all situations. You may struggle a little more in certain situations and other tanks may struggle more in others. As long as you don't get to the point where the group starts wishing for another class to come tank, we're probably in a good spot.<br />
<br />
We haven't seen a ton of evidence that warrior threat or dps are much lower than the other tanks, but it is definitely something we monitor. We don't want to be in a situation where any of the tanking classes feels like the gimped class that nobody wants.<br />
<br />
All four tanking classes, as far as I can tell, still have a lot of fear that they will reach a point where they can't do the MT job. That is a totally understandable point of view. We just don't think we're at that point for anyone right now. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/14287349581-why-nothing-blue-regarding-prot-wars.html))<br />

Dual Wield changes in 3.0.8<br />
Scaling to infinity isn't an issue per se since we aren't going to hand out weapons of infinite damage (at least in this expansion). It's cool if Necrosis and BCB favor DW. We don't think they will drive all DKs to be DW, at least with gear available in Lich King.<br />
<br />
It sounds like something didn't work right with the Killing Machine change, because the intent was to bring down the proc rate and make it more consistent between 2H and DW. We are investigating. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/14287209606-attempt-to-nerf-dw-failed-pretty-bad.html))<br />

Tier 7 Feral bonus<br />
I believe we changed the 4-piece bonus to benefit both cats and bears. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/14287209768-where-is-the-t7-feral-dps-gear.html))<br />
<br />
Faerie Fire<br />
I am almost positive the talent is looking at your spells. So if you cast Wrath, it does a check to see if you also have FF up on the target. The intent of the talent is to encourage you to cast Faerie Fire, compensating you a little for the fact that you are debuffing the target. It isn't intended to just be &quot;here have some crit.&quot; The intent is that if you cast FF, even if the debuff is already on the mob, you are rewarded for it.<br />
<br />
I suspect it isn't smart enough to detect Feral Faerie Fire now that it's a base spell, so we should probably fix the case of a Balance druid who casts FFF and then goes back to Wrath or whatever.<br />
<br />
I am just guessing based on the way spells usually work. I did not try this myself so I could be wrong. I will also admit that there are some inconsistencies currently in the game between whether you are supposed to apply a debuff again on a mob that already has it (because sometimes you get a &quot;More Powerful Spell&quot; error). This is something we're trying to clean up though. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/14133419591-yes-or-no-gc.html))<br />

Circle of Healing nerf<br />
One of the best things I got out of all of the CoH nerfing discussion was players pointing out where they thought Renew (maybe it needs to benefit from more talents), Binding Heal (maybe it's too expensive) or PoH (fill in the blank) might be falling short. That's good stuff.<br />
<br />
If you enjoy your priest, keep playing your priest. If you don't like their spells, maybe try out a different healing class. I'm sorry for those players who only played a priest because they loved Circle of Healing and won't anymore, but that's going to happen if you fall in love too much with one spell and not the whole package.

Improving Demonology<br />
We think we improve Demo mostly by improving demons, which unfortunately takes a little more work. That's not the only thing we want to do, by the way, but it's certainly part of it. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/14318771763-gc-why-does-demo-have-to-wait-.html))<br />

Deep Wounds and Q&amp;A (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/14287349231-gc-why-nerf-deep-wounds.html))<br />
Let me back up here. We have not nerfed Deep Wounds yet. We are talking about it. Players saw a nerf to Sudden Death and asked why we would nerf Arms without nerfing Fury, since Fury seems to be dominating Arms in PvE and Arms is not dominating Fury in PvP (not that we want one or the other tree to be the PvE or PvP tree anyway). I responsed that we wanted to adjust dps warrior dps by making Deep Wounds less of an overall contribution of warrior dps, buffing Arms in PvE and possibly PvP, and either keeping Fury the same or slightly nerfing them for PvE.<br />
<br />
Longer term, I think the real key to fixing some Arms (and Fury) issues is to take a hard look at stances. But those are beyond the scope of 3.0.8. <br />
<br />
They're basing 20-30 percent off encounters like Thaddius/Lotheb/Malygos where you get ridiculous damage buffs as parts of the encounter<br />
Some of you keep saying that, but we actually do understand how the encounters work. We made them, remember? Several other warriors are telling you it is a large percentage of their damage on all fights, not just the ones with unusual buff mechanics (upon which it is even larger). <br />
<br />
Ghostcrawler this nerf will hurt most warrior tanks too. <br />
It will hurt a lot of them, though honestly their dps seems pretty decent and nobody is having trouble on threat. We will compensate Prot if we need to. Deep Wounds should not be a &quot;mandatory&quot; talent for Prot, though honestly this conversation did not start because of Prot.<br />
<br />
This. It's pretty obvious to me that Deep Wounds presents a serious scaling issue that will prevent any real warrior changes in the future. Honestly Titan's Grip is still hugely OP, scaling wise, even after the Deep Wounds change<br />
This is our POV on both talents. We suspected TG would be too good, and resisted changing in for a long time in despite of so many claims that Fury would never be able to compete with the hit penalty on it. At this point we are going to just balance around TG rather than nerf it. <br />
<br />
However you are wrong saying that fury gets &quot;two buffs&quot; in the patch.<br />
I was referring to TG losing the remainder of its penalty and the WW glyph. They are minor buffs to be sure, but I think many players are scratching their heads about why we would nerf some of the top damage-dealers but buff Fury. The answer is that we aren't done yet.<br />
<br />
This is where someone cheerfully says “You should buff everybody because that’s more fun.” Suffice to say inflation is a real issue if we only ever crank numbers upwards. <br />
<br />
Deep Wounds nerf<br />
We are talking about nerfing Deep Wounds. We haven't done it yet. The reason for the nerf has entirely to do with dps warriors, though we realize it will affect some tanks.<br />
<br />
On the one hand, we don't want to nerf Prot's threat generation or dps. On the other hand, we don't want Deep Wounds to be the only way Prot can have good threat generation or dps. I'm not announcing any changes here, only our thought process. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/14287209260-nerf-to-deep-wounds.html))<br />
<br />
Deep Wounds<br />
If it's a buff at all, it's a pretty minor buff. You are correct that we changed it because the original penalty on TG had shriveled away to be inconsequential. This is a different issue from Deep Wounds. We think Deep Wounds does too much damage. We weren't suggesting Deep Wounds because of the buff to Titan's Grip. It was more of an issue of &quot;Why are you buffing Fury, who seems to do very high PvE damage already?&quot; Sorry if I mangled any explanation of that. With the &quot;patch notes&quot; out there have been a lot of hot-button topics. <br />
<br />
Sudden Death changes in 3.0.8 and RNG (Random Number Generator (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNG), you can stop asking) <br />
It's RNG but it is less RNG. Now the damage won't be so crazy on some hits, but on the flip side your rage bar won't go to zero either so you can use it for other things.<br />
<br />
Overall, this would still probably be a nerf to Arms, but as we are discussing in other threads, this is most likely not the only change. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/14287259686-gc-rng-and-arms-pvp.html))<br />
<br />
Arms PvE DPS<br />
Arms PvE dps probably needs a buff even on live. With the changes to Sudden Death and possibly one to Dual Wield, this is even more true. We are currently exploring the best way to do that.<br />
<br />
We are unhappy with Deep Wounds because it is too large of a percent of your damage. I know that sounds strange to some players who ask &quot;Why mess with it if our dps isn't too high?&quot; Balance isn't just about who is highest and lowest on meters. Having such a high portion of damage come from a persistent, unmitigated bleed we think is a problem for warriors.

You are not the only one that thinks that way. Atleast he TRIES to explain why a nerf is hitting the class. He tries to give an insight how the devs work. Yeah, you can call Blizz devs numbskulls for all I care, it still won't change the fact that THEY make this game and that they are not listening into your biased whining about your class.<br />
<br />
Oh no wait, I am playing a devil's advocate now. Clearly GC is the only dev in Blizzard HQ, clearly he is the only one making decisions, and clearly the game is been made only by his whim. Clearly the average Joe PvP whiner arms warrior that can't faceroll in arenas with a restodruid anymore is far more competent in this game. I am truly surprised none of these Joe PvPers are not hired by Blizz yet, that's the real nugget of development skill hiding deep inside the WoW playerbase, oh yes. Using obscene language at every WoW dev decision only makes it clearer that YOU, Joe PvPer are the right candidate to apply as a dev to this game. What are you waiting for? You should be mailing your CV now to make this game as you see fit!</div></div><hr />

One of the best things I got out of all of the CoH nerfing discussion was players pointing out where they thought Renew (maybe it needs to benefit from more talents), Binding Heal (maybe it's too expensive) or PoH (fill in the blank) might be falling short. That's good stuff.<br />

As much as it will make Priests have to use more than just CoH it will probably make them go DPS instead and then drive more people crazy looking for heals. But it's understood why to nerf it.</div></div><hr />

I'm a tank-specced DK and I've had problems with other DK's in PuGs that try and tank the run out from under me and sometimes causes issues.<br />
<br />
Also, I agree that there are too many DK's. That is why I really expect some major nerfs down the road. Blizzard has shown time and time again that if a class gets too popular that they'll try and shake out the flavor-of-the-month players to other classes.<br />
<br />
Not sure if it is the same for all realms, but I've noticed a real lack of ranged DPS in PvE. DPS warriors, enhance shammies, rogues, and DKs are everywhere, but trying to find a warlock these days is like a game of where's waldo.</div></div><hr />

Also, say what you want about death knights in PVP-- we're still only the second-most represented class. Paladins make up 22% of all arena teams, deathknights make up 17%.</div></div><hr />

I have personally been dying for this change, as it allows me to finally make a horde character (I despised all the low level horde areas) but only have another week or 2 to play the game before work/school starts and was thus wondering whether anyone knew when to expect this change.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mahtamori</div><div class="date">2009-01-10, 10:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Interesting that someone else in this thread brought up an issue I've experienced. I'm a tank-specced DK and I've had problems with other DK's in PuGs that try and tank the run out from under me and sometimes causes issues.<br />
<br />
Also, I agree that there are too many DK's. That is why I really expect some major nerfs down the road. Blizzard has shown time and time again that if a class gets too popular that they'll try and shake out the flavor-of-the-month players to other classes.<br />
<br />
Not sure if it is the same for all realms, but I've noticed a real lack of ranged DPS in PvE. DPS warriors, enhance shammies, rogues, and DKs are everywhere, but trying to find a warlock these days is like a game of where's waldo.<br />
<br />
DKs aren't excessively common on my realm, luckily, but as to the ranged issue. Well, ranged is easy to play and I find it boring. Maybe it has something to do with it?<br />
Alternatively it could also be that most ranged classes no longer need to spam one spell to max DPS and are now forced to use a combination of them making them harder to play.<br />
It could be either, I still haven't decided.<br />
<br />
I have noticed a drop in the Rogue population, though, for which I am thankful since I loath Rogues.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Plawsky</div><div class="date">2009-01-11, 01:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The reason that there are so many death knights is because it's something new. TBC saw the creation of tons of Shamans for alliance and Paladins for horde. Over the next couple of months, people will start going back to their original character as the DK craze settles down. (or once locks become good again - I feel like 50% of DKs are people who hate their formerly-badass locks)<br />
<br />
I think the reason that they are allowing you to make DKs on any realm is to let you more easily make an alt on another server you would like to play on - not to increase the population. Several of my friends play on a different server than I do, and this will let me play with them more easily than if I started a lvl 1 priest. Also, you shouldn't see much of a population rise in DKs, because even though people might have 10 different DKs, remember - they can only play one at a time.<br />
<br />
Finally - people seem to forgetting what the Death Knight is - a hero class. It's a special class that starts out at 55, sort of as a reward for leveling one character up that far. This is why you can't start a healer out at 55 - because a healing hero class hasn't come out yet. It would be great if you could start any kind of class out that late in the game, but imagine the QQ if you were suddenly able to make a 55 priest - thus skipping the most boring part of the leveling process imo (I'm one of the few players that actually liked outland - minus BEM).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Somewhat ironic since the highest dps specs for mage and hunters are currently more centered on spamming one spell than those classes have ever been before.</div></div><hr />

Its not confirmed nor denied anywhere<br />

Because the policy hasn't changed<br />

But it's understood why to nerf it.<br />
<br />
I don't like the idea of priests using one spell for everything, but I don't think adding a CD is actually going to help anyone, raids may end up just stacking shammys for CH. And I also worry about Holy priests going DPS instead, we have one of our three Holy priests who's already said he'd like to go shadow; again, spamming CoH is bad and I too understand the nerf, but it isn't going to help anyone.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mungazz</div><div class="date">2009-01-12, 02:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">what the game needs is some sort of challange in making a deathknight, getting to level 55 is hardly herioc. What happened to the idea of having some sort of epic lvl 80 quest chain, or the idea that you would have to trade in a lvl 55 or higher character. And now with one lvl 55 character you can create a lvl 55 deathknight on any server, so anyone planning to re roll servers will most likely choose the class 55 lvls ahead. And you would think with all these deathknights finding a tank should be easy, yet as i read the comments in lfm all i see is blood and unholy. Will things ever change, i doubt it. The damage is done, everyone has their deathknights either sitting in their login screen looking sexy in their full lvl 58 quest blues, or have decided to ditch there cloth casters for easy plate melee. The deathknight is the rerollers wet dream.</div></div><hr />

I'd say the first, less overall number of tickets, but more focus on one post. When a moderator notices it, they will delete all posts of that user anyway, especially when they're all on one thread.</div></div><hr />
