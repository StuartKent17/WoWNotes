Patch 8.0.1 - Mythic+ Cache and Wakening Essence<br />
Everyone got 1000 x Wakening Essence (https://www.wowdb.com/currencies/1533-wakening-essence) in the Mythic Cache this week, even if you didn't do any dungeons! That's enough to buy a Purified Titan Essence (https://www.wowdb.com/items/157796-purified-titan-essence).<br />
The changes we're making to the Mythic+ system for Battle for Azeroth will prevent you from receiving your normal Mythic Cache this week. As this was unintentional, your cache will include 1000 Wakening Essence and a Keystone instead of your normal rewards.<br />
<br />
If you have a problem looting the Mythic Cache, you'll receive the Keystone in the mail and the Wakening Essences will be granted after you log back in.<br />
<br />
We apologize for the inconvenience!<br />
<br />
<br />
Just a heads up but we're working on a hotfix to add the BoA legendary tokens back to the vendor. We don't have an ETA on this but we're working on it!<br />
<br />
<br />
Patch 8.0.1 Known Issues<br />
Hello all,<br />
<br />
Below is a list of known issues for patch 8.0.1. Please note that this list is not a complete depiction of what we're aware of, but a sampling of issues we believe players may encounter more often. We'll try to keep this updated with trending issues when possible. <br />
<br />
General<br />
<br />
Mounts: Gladiator's Proto-Drakes do not display information on how to obtain mounts in journal.<br />
Sometimes when summoning a player as they change zones, the summon prompt will not appear.<br />
<br />
<br />
Stat &amp; Spell Squish Impacts<br />
<br />
There are multiple issues with legacy spells &amp; monsters scaling incorrectly.<br />
<br />
<br />
Dungeon and Raid<br />
<br />
Legacy Loot: Many raid creatures no longer drop gold.<br />
Highmaul: Highmaul bosses are not dropping the appropriate amount of gold when the raid is set to mythic.<br />
Dungeon Journal - Baradin Hold: There exists an option to view Baradin Hold in 10/25 man Heroic even though the difficulty does not exist.<br />
A Lua error may occur if you try viewing the dungeon journal from the bonus roll prompt while outside of the instance.<br />
<br />
<br />
Communities/Guilds/Groups/UI<br />
<br />
Communities will reference &quot;Starter Edition&quot; accounts as &quot;Veteran Trial&quot;.<br />
Guild: Inviting players who are currently in your group to a guild may produce an assertion.<br />
Opening the Character Pane after equipping a newly acquired item on a character may result in a crash.<br />
Looting the corpse after a boss encounter while in a group may produce an assertion.<br />
Communities: Blank spaces will appear in Guild rosters if players have not logged in for multiple years.<br />
Players may be unable to whisper cross realm when selecting whisper from Communities UI.<br />
<br />
<br />
Compatibility<br />
<br />

It makes sense considering that, but with the Battle Chest often going on sale for $10, or even $5, this potentially makes getting into the game slightly more expensive.<br />
<br />
I wonder if they'll replace that with some other sort of promotional features, like discounted subscriptions or free trial months...<br />

It's giving you a free legendary. What this does is help new players dinging 110, those who want a BiS one and it's a thank you gift to those who are still farming all of them for a spec.<br />
<br />
You can buy them by farming Wakening Essence. They cost 1k and you can also get the essence from world quests. Same vendor in Dalaran who sells the random one and upgrade item.<br />
<br />
Basically any world quests that once awarded AP now award Wakening Essence.<br />
<br />
So you can use that free 1k to get your BiS one as well if you still don't have it.</div></div><hr />

no, they said before that boosting chars would be expensive to discourage it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Always been a trick to get a cheap boost. Its often cheaper to buy the latest expan and those prior than to pay for a 110 boost. The free 110 boost btw can be used on any acc. So all you have to do is buy another copy of wow and link it to your main acc's battle.net then boost a toon on mains acc. ;) fairly sure this still works.</div></div><hr />

They need to look at the level 60 to 80 leveling experience if they do not want us to buy level boosts.</div></div><hr />

BUT one of the worst is MoveAnything works not at all... and gosh, with all the crap they design to pop in the middle of one's screen, the game is pretty unplayable that way (at least to me). Some of the changes to the normal UI seems totally pointless, like moving the bars and stuff around... and, of course, that compounds the issue with standard UI elements not going where I need them to go.</div></div><hr />

the opposite holds true. They want to sell as many boosts as possible. How could anyone think otherwise?</div></div><hr />

And we can expect a lot like that until the raid. This game is a lottery.</div></div><hr />

Then again, something else might be buffed to compensate for that. <br />
You can't truly believe that reduced damage of a single ability = nerf to entire retuned spec?</div></div><hr />

Yeah how dare they offer a way for fresh 110s, people who still need a bis or collectors to get pieces from a system they are not carrying over to BFA! :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
Nobody is denying the legendary system has been subjectively appalling this expansion. But complaining about getting a free one is just complaining for the sake of it.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eygon</div><div class="date">2018-07-18, 10:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That's great for new players. Just pay for a subscription and get 14 years worth of content for free! Good deal.<br />
<br />
It's not really that big of a deal, at least in here...the battlechest was R$30,00 and came with 1 free month. A month in here costs R$23,90 and will cost R$28,90 in two weeks. So, now is R$1,10 cheaper. A lot of people keeps saying that the 5h we lost yesterday was nothing when you see the price/hour...so it's nothing too the difference on the chest/no-chest.<br />
<br />
I would prefer no subscription and having to pay FULL price on each expansion (as i paid on the time of each release), since 1 year of gameplay costs more than one expansion.</div></div><hr />
