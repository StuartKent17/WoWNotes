LFR Loot Exploit<br />
If you are getting loot off of a boss twice then it is an exploit. This has always been the case in World of Warcraft, and we expect players to know better.<br />
<br />
We’re in the process of implementing a hotfix to fix the exploit, and are deciding what steps we'll be taking for the gear that was already obtained. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/208036/lfr-loot-exploit-is-so-bad-free-tier-for-all) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/3657278530?page=5#97))<br />
<br />
Fury's Deep Wound Nerfed<br />
In 4.3, we fixed a bug where Deep Wounds was benefiting from the 40% auto attack bonus from Precision. Deep Wounds should only be triggered by crits, not passive damage.<br />
<br />
We also found a bug introduced in 4.3 (and reported by several players) that Deep Wounds was not triggered by attacks such as Heroic Leap, Intercept and most importantly, Raging Blow. We are deploying a hotfix to fix that bug.<br />
<br />
Deep Wounds should not benefit from spell enchants, such as Avalanche. In general, enchant procs should not have synergistic effects with talents or class mechanics.<br />
<br />
From what we have seen so far, Fury’s damage is still where we want it to be in 4.3. We will see how things change as more data comes in. If we think Fury’s damage needs to increase through Deep Wounds or some other mechanic, we will be sure to do so. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/208094/furys-deep-wound-nerfed-as-well) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/3657427725?page=4#62))<br />
<br />
Well of Eternity Lore<br />
The accent Tyrande has was bad.<br />
The same voice actress is responsible for her voice then and now.<br />
<br />
The explicitly sinister Illidan, despite this being before he absorbed the skull of Guldan, and even before he was imprisoned and chained for 10,000 years, is worse.<br />
He was already blinded and making use of demonic power by this point, however. I'm not quite certain what you mean by 'explicitly sinister', but he was already largely estranged from his fellows and pursuing his own research at this point. In that light, we thought it would be more interesting to show a little bit of corruption even before he consumes the powers in the skull as opposed to just having him look like a straight-up night elf. <br />
<br />
The pre-Deathwing Neltharion model complete with body ruptures and metallic jaw/plates is just laugh-out-loud ridiculous.<br />
I know that this might be a bit tough to swallow for some, but the use of the current Deathwing model in that scene was a matter of efficiency. A ton of work went into 4.3, and we squeezed in as much as we could, but it didn't make sense to dedicate the huge resources it takes to create a custom model for that one cameo, and we were concerned that using a generic black dragon model wouldn't have the same immediate value of recognition.<br />
<br />
Modifying the Illidan model made more sense because you actually spend some time running around with him in the dungeon.<br />
<br />
On that note, I should point out that creating custom models actually consumes substantial resources, so they're precious to us. Tyrande didn’t have her own model for seven years, Sylvanas didn’t have her own model for several years, etc. We'd love to have custom models for every character, for every scene at every point in the timeline, but the resources simply don't exist to make that happen. In the meantime, we hope that players can use a little bit of imagination and still enjoy the dungeons anyway, even if a given model isn't always a perfect reflection of the character. <br />
<br />
The resources don't exist?<br />
I didn't say they don't exist. They were just directed toward other efforts.<br />
<br />
For example, there's a lot of new item and environment art in this patch. There are new mounts, new armor sets, new weapons, new pets. Ultimately, while we would love to do everything, at the end of the day we always have to make choices about how and where the resources are spent. <br />
<br />
I know you have to be all &quot;PR responsible&quot; and stuff, but that's a pretty lame answer in my opinion. In fact, every time someone complains about something not being of top-notch quality, it always comes back to this answer.<br />
We always come back to that because we have x development resources which must accomplish y goals in z time. It's very common that there will be some give and take during the process. All of this is in service of trying to get the most out of the time we invest to create the best experience possible. That's incredibly important to us, and hopefully we've created some very worthwhile experiences not only in these instances, but all the other patch content too. Still, whether it's a reality of game development or not, I acknowledge that it's probably not a very satisfying answer when it seems that we've missed something that was important to you.<br />
<br />
What exactly are the people Blizzard has hired doing then? If all their efforts are resorted to weapons and mounts, instead of the prime focus of your latest patch, that's ridiculous. Unless you find the prime focus of the patch to be the weapons and mounts, then that's just sad.<br />
Our artists were busy creating new models for weapons, mounts, pets, new environments, among other things (including an entire future expansion which is currently in development). It's easy to make all those things seem unimportant, but we disagree - we want the stuff you pick up, wear and keep to look awesome whenever we can make that happen. These dungeons were an important part of 4.3 (I think the term 'prime focus' overstates the case a bit, though) and actually, a tremendous amount of effort went into making them not only fun and engaging, but also as lore-appropriate and visually authentic as possible. It's a little unfortunate that the majority of that effort is being completely overlooked.<br />
<br />
You couldn't have taken a random black dragon, increased it's size... Gave it more texture, etc? Heck, you could have taken the current model of Deathwing and modified that.<br />
All of those were possible courses of action, sure, though I suspect that using a different existing model would likely had the same result. Slight modifications to an existing model may not even have been noticed, given the light show going off in that scene. Also, as others have pointed out, he was already wearing the armor at that point. In the end, we're currently having a long discussion about a single model which appears for a few seconds, and is wreathed in gold lightning for much of that time.

you obviously did not read that part right and thus you came to a wrong assumption that the blue was wrong. He is saying that the resources dont exist to do both (A) and (B), (B) being the unique models for characters. &quot;I didnt say they [they being the resources] dont exist, they [again, the resources] were just directed towards other efforts (A).&quot;</div></div><hr />

Its not a lame excuse man.Its a completely understandable one even tho we dont like it. They have a bunch of games and a expansion to work for. Lets say they hire 10 more ppl for art work and troubleshouting for the 4.3 patch. after its done they cant alocate em to other projects because the other projects are full. So they will have to fire them. I find it better not to fire someone than hire him for a very small amount of time. The game isn't as important as real life issues.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You must be very young and very unimportant IRL. You try to make your case by insulting everyone still enjoying and finding challenge in the game by saying they're kids or mothers that have been given everything from a young age, but in fact you know NOTHING about it...you're just bitter and sad really.<br />
<br />
Seriously, everyone saying this game caters to casuals, women, kids, gay people or whatever are just major idiots...it's plain to see.<br />

It caters to anyone using it, so you shouldn't use the word &quot;casuals&quot; in a demeaning form.<br />
<br />
I've seen fully raid geared people having trouble with the encounters, thinking they'll outgear anything...in the end, anyone using LFR, is being catered to. You are also in the zone of &quot;casuals&quot; according to a lot of the more &quot;hardcore&quot; (elitist jerks) people, so don't flatter yourself.<br />
<br />
I haven't set foot in a raid in 2 years, I don't treat this game like my life or baby, and LFR is simple for ME still since I have a basic understanding of how mechanics in this game tend to work...but a lot of people fail and I know LFR isn't supposed to be extremely hard, thus I won't whine or try to e-peen myself by saying &quot;Lol casuals I don't fail omgl337hxor&quot; whenever there's a tweak or a nerf to it.<br />

I consider myself a casual hardcore (I probably outplay most people in the group when I engage in something more challenging) and my setup would probably blow your setup out of the atmosphere. Don't be stupid and try to put millions of players into one box, since everyone not as narrowminded as you know how wrong you are.</div></div><hr />

You know when we complain about they wasting resources on a damn pet and they proudly say that they have many teams working on diferent things, so modeling team has nothing to do with anything else and can spent all the time they want modeling anything? So yes, it's totally stupid to screw that even for a &quot;stupid 5 man&quot;. They want to tell the story in the 1st place, they want to explain most of that crap to ppl that don't know it. So they should make things coerent. That's not the Blizzard we now from Vanilla, TBC (or even Wrath) that paid attention to little details in their game (like breadcrumb quests to even explain what the hell is happening when new 5mans/raids are relasead) that diferentiate from other games in the market.<br />
<br />
It's that or they just show that when it comes to $$$ from pets, mounts, etc. they spent the &quot;little&quot; resources left in wow on them instead of fixing the game. So you don't have updated player models because they're using the resource modeling tyrael's chargers and all for store/anual pass $$$ instead.<br />

I've yet to see a new mount, maybe that one model of the golden/chromatic drake, everything else was in the game from 4.2 and before (striders, bears, legendary staff dragon, nether drakes, normal drakes) Who are they fooling, really.<br />
<br />
I really couldn't give a rats ass if they have new mount models or not, but when they outright lie in the face about new mount models you have to wonder if they think we're stupid. Re-texturing doesn't equal new model, a texture can be created in few hours, especially by talented people. If the new texture is just a recolor, it can be created in 5minutes playing with sliders in Photoshop, Gimp or whatever software you're using.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
The Looking-For-Dungeon / Looking-For-Raid system should now properly assign classes to the roles that are most needed, as long as those roles are selected. It should no longer confine them to Tank/Healer/DPS priority if other roles are in short supply.<br />
Master looter can no longer assign items in Looking-For-Raid groups to players that are already locked to that boss for the week.<br />
Players should be unable to trade loot they obtained from Looking-For-Raid encounters to players that are loot locked to that boss.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
So, I thought when this LFR thing came out they said you wouldn't get locked to an instance, you could essentially run it forever? Did they change their minds on that or what? If I somehow got lucky and got alot of nice pieces on my first run why would I want to run it again the same week if I can't get loot from that boss again?<br />
<br />
Maybe I'm confused what the exploit was and how it worked but honestly I thought when they announce LFR they said these things:<br />
<br />
1.) No tier<br />
2.) You could run it as much as you wanted, there was no save<br />
<br />
So, unless I'm confused what am I missing?</div></div><hr />

2.) You can loot each boss only once per week.<br />
<br />
You can get loot from bosses only the first time you kill them in a weekly fashion. Even if you are unlucky and don't win anything on your first weekly kill, you can not obtain loot again from the same boss, but you can kill him over and over again if you so desire.</div></div><hr />

Heck, you could have taken the current model of Deathwing and modified that.All of those were possible courses of action, sure, though I suspect that using a different existing model would likely had the same result. Slight modifications to an existing model may not even have been noticed, given the light show going off in that scene. Also, as others have pointed out, he was already wearing the armor at that point. In the end, we're currently having a long discussion about a single model which appears for a few seconds, and is wreathed in gold lightning for much of that time<br />

They don't have an unlimited budget. You can't run a business by spending money frivolously just because you have it.<br />
<br />
Spending a lot of extra money on something which would have very little impact on customer satisfaction is not acceptable to Blizz.<br />
Delaying the patch significantly for an extra model would not be acceptable to the players.<br />
<br />
I definitely feel like they made the right choice in not making a new model. Could they have re-used a black dragon model? Maybe, but it would reduce the impact of the scene as there are players who don't know that Neltharion and Deathwing are the same.</div></div><hr />

Delaying the patch significantly for an extra model would not be acceptable to the players.<br />
<br />
I definitely feel like they made the right choice in not making a new model. Could they have re-used a black dragon model? Maybe, but it would reduce the impact of the scene as there are players who don't know that Neltharion and Deathwing are the same.<br />
<br />
...and that is the exact kind of player that is ruining the game for everyone, why? Because not knowing that Deathwing is Neltharion the Earth-Warder implies that they either skipped or didn't pay any attention to Cataclysm quests(80-85, mainly Deepholm and Twilight Highlands ones).<br />
<br />
In essence, the problem really lies in how Blizzard handled the storytelling of Deathwing, with Arthas you had we had the Culling of Stratholme as a dungeon with the addition of Icecrown quests telling how he became the Lich King in WotLK.<br />
<br />
Now if this approach would have been followed in Cataclysm, there would have been need for models of Deathwing's uncorrupted and midway corrupted versions. Why? Those should have been the things thats should have been told in 4.1 dungeons rather than a poorly done Rise of the Zandalari story arc, which was rather out of place.<br />
<br />
Cataclysm with regards to its storytelling component was plain poor, compared to what previous expansions have done...</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Volden</div><div class="date">2011-12-03, 04:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Why is there so much hate on this particular post? Are there some flaws with Cataclysm? Yes. Are there some flaws with Deathwing/Well of Eternity Lore (at least aesthetically)? Yes. But In my opinion, I truly believe they are taking a great game and making it better with all the features they've added since WoW 1.0. If you've been there from the beginning as much of you have I'm sure, I think it would be hard for you to disagree that How this game is run is far superior to its humble origins. The endless 5-man Dungeons that took both an ample amount of time to set up and get everyone there and the sometimes 4 hour+ time to complete come to mind :P.Most important to me (even as a Lore buff) is the Gameplay. <br />
<br />
If you want the back-story of Deathwing, read the War of the Ancients trilogy. Myself, I am very happy with the direction they are taking WoW as well as the decisions they are making to keep the game play aspects ans fun as possible. You are all welcome to your own opinion as I am and I won't try to convince you to see things my way. I just find it funny that so many people set expectations up for one thing and when Blizzard deliveries something different (albeit just as amazing) they recoil to a place of negative criticism instead of finding the silver lining in such a great game. <br />
<br />
For the doubters of WoW who are thinking of leaving: Cheer up, This game is evolving and growing in new and exciting directions. And if you've been there since Day one like many of you have, I'm sure you don't want to miss the ride! ^_^. The experience has been well worth it for me and I can say the same for a majority of others in my guild, family and friends who are also very happy to continue playing. :D:D:D</div></div><hr />

Just watched a lvl 10 dungeon in SWTOR... also played in last beta...<br />
<br />
This is the equivalent to RFC mind you, it was longer, more engaging, a heck of alot harder from the looks of it, I mean... RFC is practically soloable in its current state, even at the intended level.<br />
<br />
Anyhow, my point being, they will probably lack end game content, as all new MMOs does, BUT, saying it will be easy, when all I've seen is the opposite, thats just taking it a stretch. WoW is piss easy, so claiming another game, which is clearly harder btw, will fail because its easy?... wait what?<br />
<br />
<br />
That said, Im an avid WoW fan still, and Im planning to be playing SWTOR only untill MoP hits the shelves, as I have no more intrest in cataclysm.<br />
And hell, the story alone makes SWTOR worth playing through.</div></div><hr />

Yes I noticed it was named &quot;Neltharion&quot; but...I went with what I saw...the same guy I've been seeing for months. It's like having &quot;present day&quot; Marty McFly be his own father in the future, but putting absolutely no aging effects or makeup on him. It...doesn't make any sense. Should've just made a larger black dragonflight dragon...like he mentioned. They just made the wrong choice. And again, BS on limited resources.

You can get loot from bosses only the first time you kill them in a weekly fashion. Even if you are unlucky and don't win anything on your first weekly kill, you can not obtain loot again from the same boss, but you can kill him over and over again if you so desire.<br />
<br />
Ok so wait, blizzard hype the feature of not getting locked and saying &quot;Hey this will be great, you can run LFR a million times a week and not get saved, but you can only win something your first time killing the boss?&quot; Now, if you meant you can keep running, and keep killing and win something on your 15th time killing the boss that's different.

I agree with your whole &quot;play the game more than gear up&quot;, but if there's no &quot;reward&quot; to it, why bother? Hell, there isn't a guaranteed reward to it to begin with, but there is a chance of a reward at least, taking that &quot;chance&quot; away after the first lockout (let's not kid ourselves, it is a lockout) I definitely am on the bandwagon that LFR is dumb. I just don't think it's dumb because of the difficulty level like everyone else who thinks it's dumb.<br />

The &quot;reward&quot; is having fun with your friends, or just having fun in general. I don't see why everyone is so obsessed with always having to have an item to obtain than just playing for fun.</div></div><hr />

It's actually the exact opposite.<br />

Adults with children really can't do much outside their own house. So all they do is sit there and raid like it's a job.<br />

So, basicly. All the top guilds who abused LFR Exploit should get banned. But in case those are the top guilds blizzard probably wont ban them. And even if they do... the top guilds will cry like babies because they got ban they deserve. I mean, they knew it was but and still abused it. I hope they get banned in Maintanceday for 72h.<br />
<br />
Dream Paragon and everyone else who used the exploit should be perma banned. They knew what they were doing was wrong. But it's the top end guilds that did it so expect a slap on the wrist, otherwise who would play test the end game content Blizzard's supposed to test? :confused:</div></div><hr />

Sorry, but hardcore or casual isn't based on how much time they can put into the game. You're logic is saying they can't do anything outside of the game because of their kids, but they have all the time in the world to play because of their kids? It doesn't make sense.<br />
<br />
In the end, you don't nor can't define someone hardcore or casual based off of the time they put into the game. I've said it before and I've said it again, you can kill a boss raiding 4 hours a week just as easily as you can kill a boss raiding 7 days a week.<br />
<br />
Once again, you say someone is hardcore based off of raiding 4+ days a week and casual based off raiding 2 hours a week, it's not.<br />
<br />
By your definition, I know many many hardcore players who raid 7 days a week and quite simply are terrible.<br />

This isn't technically in response to you, but to the people who think these &quot;top guilds&quot; who looted more gear than they should have whether banned or not is just like every new &quot;exploit&quot; (blizzards terms for the &quot;issue&quot;) are doing blizzards job on live servers. They should have EASILY caught the &quot;exploit&quot; on the PTR since what, you think these &quot;top guilds&quot; weren't doing it there as well?<br />

Should they have been banned? Meh, I don't think so considering blizzard actually did... test the feature and didn't see the problem on the PTR. They got caught, they live with it, they move on. Why should they be perma banned?<br />

I agree with what you're saying. But I'm just curious, wasn't it tested in the PTR for a month? Was it not possible to use the exploit on the PTR but you can on live?<br />
<br />
Maybe I'm wrong but I thought they were the same folks who did the whole saronite bombs lich king kill. Their a top end guild though, I just think they should held to a higher standard if they're given all these perks by Blizzard like testing new content before everyone else.<br />
<br />
I do think cheaters should get more than a slap on the wrist for this though (72 hour ban, gimme a break). I'd like to see their subscriptions price go up. That kind of penalty would get people's attention.</div></div><hr />

I THOUGHT Paragon was banned 72 hours once before? Normally it's 24, 48, 72, Perma depending on severity as you can see so I would assume they would have been perma banned either way obviously blizzard can't just change subscription prices on the fly to select individuals. Also, you can't hold certain people to higher standards just because they are good either.<br />

Especially in the last several years, what Blizzard has failed in with gameplay they have made up for in giving players the ability to completely ignore the manchildren and simply enjoy the game. In LFR, I can just ignore the chat and try to enjoy myself. It is marvelous, one of the best things they've come up with. <br />
<br />
I look at some of the people in these forums, and I think to myself &quot;You are the reason we can't have nice things.&quot; Blizzard could focus more on content if it wasn't for the fact that the content tends to get ignored because new players are chased away by idiots who think this game belongs exclusively to them. That is what makes me hesitant to play other MMOs. I respect Bioware, but I question how prepared they are to deal with the selfish pricks who like to ruin things for everyone else. If they aren't prepared, then people will play a couple of months and then quit. Then, like every other also-ran MMO out there, all that will be left are the trolls. <br />
<br />
I think maybe that's why Blizzard decided to go with pandas. They knew that the people who would hate it most are the people developers don't want playing their game anyway. Blizzard can add pandas, ponies, rainbows, and teddy bears for all I care, I'd give my left testicle to play an MMO free of immature douchebags.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I THOUGHT Paragon was banned 72 hours once before? Normally it's 24, 48, 72, Perma depending on severity as you can see so I would assume they would have been perma banned either way obviously blizzard can't just change subscription prices on the fly to select individuals. Also, you can't hold certain people to higher standards just because they are good either.<br />
<br />
At the end of it all, they are players just like the newest subscriber who is only level 39.<br />
<br />
Ensidia right. Thanks! Yeah I thought they pulled some schenanagans a couple times before too. <br />
<br />
I guess my point is if they get the perks of testing new content first and other stuff, why should they get away with breaking the rules? They allow select individuals benefits above everyone else, why can't they penalize select individuals accordingly? I seem to recall in the past folks got perma banned for doing the drop through the floor trick in AQ40 to get directly to C'Thun and avoid the trash. <br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong, I see your point, but I know Blizzard usually gives you a 72 hour ban then a perma ban. I've never heard of four tiers of penalties.</div></div><hr />

If you are talking about the satisfaction with friends after completing a challenge (ie: sense of achievement / beat the game), face rolling easy mode boss just doesn't generate that.<br />
<br />
They shouldn't really make 25men and 10men sharing the same raid lockout in the first place; which we wont have to choose between beating challenging 25men content with guild and have fun getting achievements with friends. (remember, 10 men is easy mode, even in Korea!)</div></div><hr />

Most people are not game designers. Letting the people decide on what they want makes a mess of things because they are all pulling in different directions.

Not this again - Ensidia/Paragon/Whoever get no advantage in testing new content - they sign up for the PTR like everyone else. If they get further in it, that's because they are, you know, quite good at it.</div></div><hr />

Sorry you're wrong. It's been done in the past. Maybe things have changed a bit now but if you don't think these top end guilds will automatically get a MoP beta invite for example, you're fooling yourself.</div></div><hr />

It depends. I quit wow for SWTOR but I know they are limiting the number of players initially to keep their servers stable and make the game play strong. I do hope wow loses more subscribers. Blizzard really has put only the minimum into the game in the past 2 years I'd say.</div></div><hr />

going off the high quality mods on skyrim nexus for skyrim, which are MUCH higher resolution, have normal maps, and higher poly geometry; it takes &quot;zero time&quot; to make new assets. (that being a figure of speech, it takes minimal time). Blizz = bullshitters.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The quotes that you have in your post can both be true at the same time (Random WoW person - &quot;The accent Tyrande has was bad.&quot; and the CM's reply - &quot;The same voice actress is responsible for her voice then and now.&quot;). Simply because they have the same voice actress, means just that; that they both are provided by the same voice actress. Debating the quality of the voice is an entirely separate issue which was not covered by the CM's reply.<br />
<br />
Having heard Tyrande's accent, both the Warcraft 3 version, and the WoW 4.3 version of it, one can safely say that they do not sound identical. There is a very notable difference between the intonations in the voice, and it is a difference that is noticed immediately upon hearing her voice in WoW's Well of Eternity. Tyrande's Warcraft 3 voice sounds a lot more precise, soft, flowing and mature. Her WoW voice does have a definite troll-esque intonation, flow and feel to it, and almost a subtle slur of the words. <br />
<br />
Also worth noting is that Tyrande's WoW voice is missing the crisp priestess-like qualities, as well as elf-like qualities, of the War3 version. Listen to Shandris' voice in the first video which I have provided below. One will notice the clarity and crispness of her voice as well. Very elf-like.<br />
<br />
Since there is a prominent disparity between the 2 voices, that is the reason why the accent has been deemed, by numerous people, as being 'bad'. <br />
<br />

<br />
I am totally agreeing with your statements, except this quoted one. I made 3 times the Agra in LFR encounters with 3 different alts, and I fell into your definition of &quot;Baddies&quot; but first time was with my healer, I was shocked by the difference level between normal and LFR difficulties: how everyone just ignore boss abilities and survived anyway, when I saw the ICY spikes, I just didn't bother moving thinking I would survive.<br />
Second time was with warlock alt, this time I did everything as intended, never died and topped dps (was really easy because most were ilvl 372 thanks to their PVP gears). The third time was with my warrior alt, and the ICY spikes were so slow that I decided to Heroic Leap other the spikes to get to the next shard and almost died by damages during the leap which was not consistent regarding other encounters (where you can leap through Al'Akir storms, over Atramedes flames, etc). <br />
Anyway, I will try heroic leap next week again (and certainly will die from it), also try the warlock portal just for the fun of testing. I don't think that would categorized me as Baddies ;)</div></div><hr />

I respectfully disagree. You can't lump everyone into two categories. I'm not a SW fan boy and I don't just want to play something new regardless of the quality. I played the beta and found the questlines to be superior to wows, the voiceovers a step above wow, and the general play/graphics/sound quality to be quite good. I felt I was the story instead of just on the sidelines like in wow. That goes a long way to making a game fun.</div></div><hr />

We should start donating art to blizzard. They are claiming since call of the crusader that they simply can not create enough art and content because they do not have the resources. Poor dudes. I call for custom models to be send to blizzard. Weapons, Mounts, Dragons, just keep it low poly count to not overload the engine. <br />
<br />
Maybe can get polycount limits for thos models from blizzard, so we can addapt. Modify the existing deathwing model should have take for a professional less than two hours ... but we all know blizzard is short on money because activision is burning so much of it.</div></div><hr />

If her accent ruins your game, simply turn off the sound or even better, change the voice yourself to something you ought to like.</div></div><hr />
