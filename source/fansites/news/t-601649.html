Btw can allready imagen a Deathknight spell, Death Defying blow, Adds 200 damage to each melee damge of the Death Knight If the target dies from the effect of defying blow there is a small chance of the Corpse of the enimey being reanimated as a servant Of the Death Knight :P<br />

Nothing on that bullet point suggests it as a transcendant/Hero type class. It's just another class option. We'll be able to reroll Death Knights no matter what we do or do not have.</div></div><hr />

That's how many people thought it would be... similar to attaining a Jedi in the old days of SWG, you would have to go through with a long line of quests to gain the ability to start anew as a Jedi.</div></div><hr />

Well, of course there would be other hero classes if they were doing that, but like I said before, it doesn't look like that's going to be so.</div></div><hr />

You must have up a warlock lvl 80 and a warrior/paladin 80 then you &quot;sacrifice&quot; both of them and you create a death knight ? <br />

I'm not sure what the question is, but A. I don't think you'd need both, and B. You don't necessarily &quot;Sacrifice&quot; the character, you just gain the option to make one. This is all speculation on how hero classes would work of course, and none can be for sure, especially since it looks like they won't be adding them for a little longer.</div></div><hr />

Going by that logic, Warlocks are not in the Alliance either. But I'll be damned if they are and have been the entire time.<br />
<br />
Just because some races have Warlocks, doesn't mean it will be (in the lore) out in the open. Paladins will not walk up to Death Knights and say &quot;Hey, you're a Death Knight? That's pretty cool.&quot; Death Knights would hide behind the facade of being normal warriors, and only bring their powers to bear where it was safe or subtle.</div></div><hr />

Ture, the alliance warlocks have a hidden fasility in stormwind, its behind a secret door in a inn, hidden in a serie of crypts, i guess thats where the DK tranier will be too</div></div><hr />

Death Knight being a character class is not too big of a deal, since Paladins are also heroes in WC3...but I really had wished that Death Knight would be earned, instead of just given to us, making us to reroll...<br />

Of course I was quite sure they wouldn't add Blood Elves as a playable race due to their hatred of both sides... and we all know how that turned out. &gt;.&gt;</div></div><hr />

There's still some Old Gods out there that aren't accounted for, my guess is one of them is under Tirisfal Glades. There's also still some yet-unkown entity corrupting the Emerald Dream, although this might be the Old Gods as well. Sargeras himself is still out there, although him as a raid boss would be like, &quot;we're done with this franchise&quot; on the part of Blizzard. And also, something happened to Gilneas at some point, which is why the king walled it off. Maybe theres some unknown evil afoot there; I'm really hoping it gets added as a zone. Same goes for the cursed halls of Grim Batol, where the death of the Dark Iron Queen Modgud left what seemed to be a permanent dark stain.<br />
<br />
Also Blizzard can just make crap up like they always do. But I have faith that whatever crap they make up will fit the lore.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You forget about the Dark Iron dwarves that broke away from their kingdom and founded the Thorium Brotherhood. They're far from pure-hearted. Also, Thane Kor'thazz of the 4 Horsemen in Naxxramas is a perfect example that Dwarven Deathknights are not so far-fetched.</div></div><hr />

Everything good is summarized on the front page. WoWinsiders panel things are good too. The live stream cut out TWICE during Death Knight discussion for other stuff that wasn't nearly as important.</div></div><hr />
