As we’ve discussed before, the nature of WoW Classic sometimes invokes different memories for different players, and this leads to certain misconceptions for some about what is or isn’t working as intended.<br />
<br />
The following is a list of commonly-reported gameplay in WoW Classic that is not actually a bug, and is working as we expect it to:<br />
<br />
<br />
Tauren’s hitboxes and their melee reach is slightly larger than other races.<br />
Being critically struck while using /sit to sit does not cause abilities like Enrage, Blood Craze, and Reckoning to activate.<br />
Using the “Automatic Quest Tracking” option does not auto-track newly accepted quests. (It instead will start to track an existing quest once progress towards an objective is started.)<br />
Warrior health Regeneration is working at the expected rate.<br />
Quests objectives and points of interests are not tracked on the map or minimap.<br />
Completed quests are marked on the minimap with a dot. (and not a “?”)<br />
Feared players and NPCs run fast.<br />
Standing on top of other players while facing away allows spells and attacks to be used.<br />
Creature respawn rates are much slower than in Battle for Azeroth.<br />
NPCs which offer multiple quests may inconsistently display them as a dot or a “!” on the available quests list. They were inconsistent in 1.12, and we’ve reproduced the exact inconsistency they had back then.<br />
Quests that are too low level for do not show up as a “!” in the game world.<br />
Available quests do not display a “!” on the minimap.<br />
On level up, the message: “Your skill in Protection increased to 15” was added in 1.12.1, and we’re intending to keep that.<br />
<br />
<br />
We appreciate all of your feedback!<br />

Sharding Bug in WoW Classic Beta<br />
Seen a couple instances of sharding happening since the last server restart about an hour ago. Blizz, what did you do?<br />
This is a known issue that we are actively investigating. Please continue to report these types of mob-behavior if they are happening in other locations. (Blue Tracker (https://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/1105644-sharding-after-latest-server-restart/) / Official Forums (https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/175660/88))<br />
<br />
They just said it was a bug tho, it’s a beta, this is what we test in a beta<br />
This is definitely why we do a beta test. We can also do things like reset the realm at a busy time like 4:30pm PDT to try and find the source of a certain issue where a crocolisk is losing it’s brain due to how multiple processes are interacting and mirroring code to form a cohesive world. There were similar types of issues like this back in 2004 but we wanted to try and resolve this one before the weekend for the folks who are testing.

Wow, gg Paladins then huh?<br />
That was working incorrectly on private this whole time?<br />
Damn, that’s a pretty crushing blow for Prot Paladins who were using it to game massive heals and weapon procs.<br />

Just kind of gets thrown out casually by Blizzard.<br />
Uh oh.<br />

Do we? Ive been playing the way i described on my paladin for the better part of 5 years?<br />
<br />
At some point, i have to wonder authentic to what? To the product that changed 10 times in a year and a half, or the product everyone has been playing for the last 5 plus years that has never changed intentionally and is the reason for this product coming about.<br />
<br />
Obviously i would want blizzard to be true to their source but, i am getting more and more worried about imbalances that will likely arise from these small differences.<br />
<br />
Lets hope its for the best, because a product like this really has a shelf life. If end game isn’t interesting or properly engaging, what will people be doing a year from now or more?<br />

abilities like that could never be forced in the original game by sitting it was a wonky interaction on private servers as private servers where a good 75% guesswork along with some data mining of the original client the last 15% was taken from the few super potato quality videos that where made back then</div></div><hr />

That's because they the old version will be running on a new codebase. You will not be using the &quot;original&quot; client from 2005, it's some kind of reproduction if you pass me the term.</div></div><hr />

I've been playing a paladin during classic WoW times and I did abuse /sit command against rogues a lot (to stack reckoning). Either I have brain damage and can't recall correctly or Blizzard changed that just for the new release.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RamGuy</div><div class="date">2019-05-18, 05:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm happy to see them really committing to this. I didn't think I would be all that interested, but I will sure give it a go. Personally I wouldn't mind quality of life improvements and most of my friend don't really care for a 100% authentic vanilla experience but they want the old zones and world, a game world pre-Cataclysm but have no requirement for it being &quot;authentic&quot; to World of Warcraft Patch 1.12.2.<br />
<br />
I'm not all that hardcore on &quot;Classic&quot;, I want to relive the old zones and the old world and it seems like most people I'm taking to is feeling the same. We would prefer to have quality of life improvements regardless of them actually being in the game at in 1.12.2 or not. Like the &quot;Automatic Quest Tracking&quot; to actually track it properly without you having to actually trigger progress in the quest for it to show up would make perfect sense. It's no real need to make such a thing behave nonsensical just because it's &quot;authentic&quot;.<br />
<br />
Same goes for the Meeting/Summoning Stones, the automatic flight paths, additional mail boxes etc.. A lot of this got implemented in The Burning Crusade but all of this doesn't really hurt the &quot;Classic experience&quot; but are some really obvious quality of life improvements that improves the experience.<br />
<br />
<br />
But I guess they are just saving themselves some complaints. For them to decide what is worthy quality of life improvements and what is not is next to impossible. People would complain regardless so having thing replicate 1.12.2 is much easier for them.</div></div><hr />

People have been doing research on it and it was a thing apparently prior to 1.12, but it was fixed with the version of the game that Blizz went with. But PS's never got that memo apparently.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, I brought it up on the paladin forums. Whenever I looked for Ret pvp talent builds I was always disappointed they always pointed at the &quot;Reck Bomb&quot; stuff. So this made me rather relieved.<br />
<br />
Overall though I'm happy Blizzard made this post to show what things that are intended, and not bugs. Hopefully we'll see more of them because I didn't even think of some of these things - like the Tauren hitbox / weapon reach, it makes sense but I didn't really think about it!</div></div><hr />

Haven't seen that many yet complain about these things (maybe on the wow forums, haven't read there much) but once I saw the &quot;We want 1.5 AV for our 1.12 patch!&quot; I knew the &quot;no changes&quot; crowd had a lot of hypocrits with them.</div></div><hr />

I was fairly certain that until the pre-TBC patch, you could not see Shaman gear on Alliance (and vice versa) drop unless they were BoE pieces. I just have some memory of that being the case and the first time I saw it drop as a chestpiece (dungeon set from UBRS) after the pre-patch launched.<br />

I suppose because of the word that you use at the start of your first sentence, insinuating people who misremember something have a variation of autism ...</div></div><hr />

Imagine that they don't learn that until they're past 40 (given how they might not even efford it then, or just don't try run through a door yet). And that there is no boosting so you have to level up first to find out. Which takes longer in classic. Gleeee.</div></div><hr />

Anyone that is looking forward to Classic is fully aware of all that was, by your definition, wrong/broken/bugged. <br />
<br />
They aren't improving Classic they are, in almost every instance, reproducing Classic (warts and all, lack of QoL improvements etc) and that's how it should be. And even with it's faults Classic will be a far better game than BFA.<br />
<br />
Classic isn't for everyone and you obviously are not the target market. But instead of revelling in what you perceive to be justification of your viewpoint you should be happy that as of mid-August myself, and many others, will be renewing our subscriptions and in the process helping to support retail WoW. But for Classic Blizzard would never have gotten another dime out me after 3 consecutive disappointing expansions. The day they make changes to Classic to appease people like you is the day I stop playing altogether.</div></div><hr />

For the most part, addons could have been quite advanced back in classic as well, but for some of those really advanced addons it took years for people to make them.<br />

It did exist in Vanilla wow, just not for the entire of Vanilla, Can't remember, but if u go on wowwiki u will find a patch which removed the option of sitting down to forcefully to get crit in order to get enraged. <br />

100% agree, all of the people screaming and Shouting about stuff they honestly would have no way of knowing, none of them looked at old Vanilla warriors levelling in 2004. they can only compare it to private servers. even though the HP regen seems to be in accordance to what I've seen on Northdale, so not sure what they are smoking, I guess they're just looking for issues for the sake of it.

<br />
abilities like that could never be forced in the original game by sitting it was a wonky interaction on private servers as private servers where a good 75% guesswork along with some data mining of the original client the last 15% was taken from the few super potato quality videos that where made back then<br />

<br />
People are correct that sitting in Vanilla was a thing, they are just wrong why. So sitting in combat was something you could macro in vanilla but not as an exploit. Sometimes tanks over-geared content so much that they didn’t take enough damage to generate rage to cause threat. What would happen was that if you sit you could guarantee a crit that would get you lots of rage to up your threat and let the dps goto town. This was a thing in BC too iirc.<br />
<br />
<br />
The reason people think this has to do with an exploit is that it was an exploit in Woltk that allowed a Prot Pally with reck to one shot bosses.<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm happy to see them really committing to this. I didn't think I would be all that interested, but I will sure give it a go. Personally I wouldn't mind quality of life improvements and most of my friend don't really care for a 100% authentic vanilla experience but they want the old zones and world, a game world pre-Cataclysm but have no requirement for it being &quot;authentic&quot; to World of Warcraft Patch 1.12.2.<br />
<br />
I'm not all that hardcore on &quot;Classic&quot;, I want to relive the old zones and the old world and it seems like most people I'm taking to is feeling the same. We would prefer to have quality of life improvements regardless of them actually being in the game at in 1.12.2 or not. Like the &quot;Automatic Quest Tracking&quot; to actually track it properly without you having to actually trigger progress in the quest for it to show up would make perfect sense. It's no real need to make such a thing behave nonsensical just because it's &quot;authentic&quot;.<br />
<br />
Same goes for the Meeting/Summoning Stones, the automatic flight paths, additional mail boxes etc.. A lot of this got implemented in The Burning Crusade but all of this doesn't really hurt the &quot;Classic experience&quot; but are some really obvious quality of life improvements that improves the experience.<br />
<br />
<br />
But I guess they are just saving themselves some complaints. For them to decide what is worthy quality of life improvements and what is not is next to impossible. People would complain regardless so having thing replicate 1.12.2 is much easier for them.<br />
<br />
The vanilla experience was spending 45 minuets to cross the ocean just to find out you missed a step or item and need to spend 45 min going back. You’d also have no place to confirm you made this mistake as thottbot rarely had the answer.<br />
<br />
Forming a group in a capital city then spending another 10-15 min to get to Blackrock or Plaguelands if your Alliance, 30 min as Horde. That’s Vanilla.<br />
<br />
Quest tracker not updating progress and taking up most of the right side of the screen. That’s vanilla. Oh and it’s terribly inaccurate and sometimes wouldn’t update.<br />
<br />
This is all pure vanilla. I have a feeling the fees are playing a joke to prove a point. It’s amusing:<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
I have never played on private servers, but I swear I remember classes that had &quot;on enemy crit&quot; effects using /sit to proc them back in vanilla. Maybe they were just trying to build up more rage?<br />
<br />
It was to build rage<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
Threat and dps depend on proper mob id reporting, if that's in then those will work great. <br />
<br />
Vanilla had a ton of UI and questing add-ons so that's no question really<br />
<br />
The questing addons only tracked one at a time and basically just saved the quest text and added an arrow that hardly worked. Those didn’t come till after all the class patches and Blackwong. Not much of a help and they slowed down the game, even on the best hardware. Hope they introduce memory links on purpose again. Ya know for classic.<br />
<br />
Decursive and any auto add on was killed so expecting that as well. They even had an add on that highlighted enemy player races through walls. That was banned. I’m thinking Blizzard will only allow certain addons and limited UI modification. Ya know for classic.<br />

I remember my buddy telling me Tauren was a thing back in the day b/c they had a longer melee range and u could hit ppl easier when u chased them around pillars.<br />
<br />
Funny to c a list of intended bugs for classic. Really shows a lot of players really don’t know what they r getting into.<br />
<br />
They mostly had a disadvantage. More likely to be attacked in AV, drew more attention and very easy to click on when tabbing wasn’t well known or as accurate.<br />
<br />
Don’t forget tabbing had a lot of logic added to it over the years.<br />
<br />
Original tabbing literally selected every creature in the area and if you went to fast, which was common, you’d have to go through every critter and creature to get back around, hoping not to miss it again.</div></div><hr />

I didn't give you the infraction (neither did I report you)...you asked, I guessed - there is nothing for me to &quot;get over&quot;.

Ditto. They KNOW what target audience they are aiming for unlike the BFA team which wants to aim for every person that exists. This means you also know HOW to communicate, since they know the audience.<br />
<br />
Well, I am not making judgements here - that team &quot;only&quot; needs to recreate what once there was there in a pre-defined time frame / patch. They don't invent, don't implement new things. Do they know what the target audience is? Looking at the last year of thread here, the Classic audience had different ideas, they are NOT all on the same page.<br />

Yeah that's just not true.<br />
<br />
The famous vanilla private servers, such as Nostalrius, were built upon 15+ years of emulator work(dating back to the WoW Alpha). The first private server i played on was back in 05/06 and literately nothing worked, the only thing they were good for was exploring areas you couldn't normally get to. It took many many years before functional so called &quot;blizzlike&quot; servers started showing up, this might in part be due to less demand for a vanilla server back then but a large factor was how shitty it was compared to the retail servers. You either played because you couldn't afford retail or because you wanted to play custom server such as &quot;lvl 255 fun-servers&quot;.</div></div><hr />

LIKE WHAT THA ACTUAL FUK IS HE DOING?!!! i main'd drood back in 2006 when i started playing and it's just disrespectful seeing a person, like SODAPOPPIN, having the greatest adventure of his life and i'm here raging about it coz one thing is to have a purpose to launch a BETA and that purpose is to find bugs.. but why would i try to find bugs if i can have fun and play with friends.. wow...</div></div><hr />

Yeah, I suppose that's a good point actually with people not being on the same page. But it's still an audience who wants Classic (even if done differently) and while some things are wrong, it still has a focus on a couple of few elements (Leveling as a journey, then you go either to PvP or you do Dungeons which then moves over to BWL and they all have one difficulty each) rather than BFA which just has way too many things for me to count... x_x</div></div><hr />

Well, a lot of this depends on the information the game provides. Quest location information is not present, like its in modern WoW. Threat information is not present, this was one of the things intentionally removed.<br />
<br />
Making a &quot;manual&quot; threat meter would however be much easier for classic then it was in vanilla, because we still do have the modern combat log, which has a lot more detailed information then the vanilla combat log had.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But hey, if you want to throw your money away with terrible taste you go for it<br />
<br />
Though a little snarky you and I actually agree because my point is simply this...Classic, warts and all, appeals to certain people and retail WoW appeals to others. Those that joined the game in Wrath or later probably won't like Classic for the very reasons I do like it and instead of complaining about Classic should continue to play BFA and be happy my subscription fee is helping to pay for future expansions of the game they prefer.<br />
<br />
The difference between the 2 versions of the game is that Retail is all about the destination (and I'm being nice there) and Classic is all about the Journey.<br />
<br />
LFR, LFD, fast respawn rates, neutered mini world bosses, Azerite traits (and associated systems in prior expansions), sharding, Island expeditions etc etc all make me want to gag.<br />
<br />
I'm quite content to have to wait till level 40 to get a mount (if I was able to save up enough gold), to have professions that are relevant to my game play and to have to gather the resources for Pots etc needed to raid, do attunements and run them 100's of times to get new guildees eligible for Raids, wait for mobs to respawn and make friends with others doing the same, grouping up with people to kill those mini world bosses, actually having to read quest text to figure where to go and what to do, running to the summoning stone and taking a break on a 15 minute flight path etc...if you're not into those things Classic isn't for you and you (read anyone) shouldn't play it. <br />
<br />
It's just that simple. Like remastered Atari games I know what I'm getting with Classic and will play it warts and all. If it doesn't appeal to you don't play it and please don't try to change it.</div></div><hr />

One of the best things I’ve seen in a long time. All the streamers and people clamoring for Classic and how fondly they remember it and how they know exactly how WoW used to be now finding out all of their memories aren’t too accurate.<br />
Still, I’m sure Classic will be big at launch which will fall off within a month or two and then have a pretty dedicated following. I doubt it will overtake retail, but I still think it will have a nice size population.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But this stuff isn't bugs, it's the *features* they asked for, unless they're the people who asked for vanilla but really wanted it radically altered to the point where is was live except without the features they disliked.<br />
<br />
Either the people making these reports are people who haven't played vanilla and didn't know what to expect, or they're players who forgot how much vanilla could be a real pain.</div></div><hr />

That had nothing to do with /sit. That video was obtained by dueling a rogue, NOT /sit. What was nerfed after that video was infinite reck stacking. /sit was removed much later.<br />

Edit, damnit, this was meant to be a reply to the guy who posted the one-shot Kazzak video, claiming that's why /sit was changed. It wasn't. Infinite stacking was hotfixed after that (around 1.4 - 1.6 iirc.) The /sit change didn't come until 1.12.</div></div><hr />

Pretty sure after all the years of Classic wishing and retail players responses that not a single person thinks Classic is BfA, but more that people don’t really remember what Vanilla was like.<br />

You're just making assumptions.<br />
<br />
Blizzlike servers have been around for as long as Vanilla wasn't current in everyone's mind (that means TBC and on, in case you're trolling); the more functional, less poopy playgrounds were simply less known or, in some cases, underground.<br />

You learned something new today, whoa!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Blizzlike servers have been around for as long as Vanilla wasn't current in everyone's mind (that means TBC and on, in case you're trolling); the more functional, less poopy playgrounds were simply less known or, in some cases, underground.<br />
<br />
You learned something new today, whoa!<br />
<br />
What assumptions am I making?<br />
<br />
Like I said in my post I played on blizzlike servers during vanilla, so obviously they were around at the time of TBC.<br />
<br />
I think it's more likely that you and I have different definitions of &quot;functional&quot;. By functional I am referring to servers where abilities and talents worked mostly as intended, most of the quests worked, LoS worked, bosses had abilities etc.<br />
<br />
Either way, the statement that a couple of dudes reversed engineered classic wow in a handful of months in their garage to a level which is comparable to this beta is false. Even if there was some underground vanilla server at the end of tbc that was decent (which i very much so doubt), it still would be the result of 5 years of emulator work.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not in beta, but addons will be available for live. Cast bars and other addons will quickly be made if not already being made. <br />
<br />
Man, some of my fondest memories of classic is playing the UI-meta and customizing the interface. I think i have some screenshots of mid to late classic with a fully modded UI.</div></div><hr />

These bug reports showcase the rose tinted glasses and nostalgia feels more than a comparison of retail.<br />
<br />
these reports showcase only that beta invite was recieved by kids and wod+ players<br />
<br />
and statement about respawn timers not like in bfa clearly shows that</div></div><hr />

Reality check. Vanilla wasn't all you think it was. I played it. I'm not playing Classic for a variety of small reasons that would just annoy me today. Back then it was new and I didn't care.</div></div><hr />

99% of Live players dont understand that &quot;nearly&quot; everything they have in the game today is a result of players (hardcore and noob) bitching because vanilla was so bad.</div></div><hr />

Uhh...you can install add-ons for sure. Not too many have been published properly but they are starting to work already even on beta. There is a ton of work to be done though to align them with the right information.</div></div><hr />

I started in Wrath, when there were still no markers for quests at all, and that could be fixed by just downloading the good ol carbonite.<br />

Love the /sit controversy though. I wonder if we'll have more of similar ones.</div></div><hr />

Classic is a shithole. If WoW would've come out like this today it would've died immediately. What I love the most are ppl who are already crying out for all QoL they have in BfA. You wanted it, now have it and shut your pieholes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
How can you tell? A lot of this list is just misremembering or being used to an inaccurate version. Tell me. How can YOU tell that there are a lot of vanilla virgins?</div></div><hr />

There are different levels of functional for sure. Highly functioning would mean you can level 1-60 without any major anomaly or blood vessel bursting error; low functioning would mean so autistic that you miss the forest for the trees while you're questing in Elwynn, due to rendering issues.</div></div><hr />

This is 1.12 which was the last patch, so after the nerf / &quot;fix&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i mean yeah, the infinite reckoning stacking was fixed, but you were still able to stack it by /sit up to, what was it... 5?</div></div><hr />

They were inconsistent in 1.12, and we’ve reproduced the exact inconsistency they had back then.<br />
<br />
This is something I find mildly annoying. They'll go as far as adding &quot;layering tech&quot; to Classic, but they refuse to correct minor bugs such as this? Seems petty to me.<br />
<br />
I get it, fans requested Blizzard to recreate Classic exactly as it was, but are we really going to overlook bugs like this?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wrong. Do a search of Reckbomb Paladin. /sit let them build stacks (at one point unlimited stacks) of the Protection talent Reckoning, leading to a one shot kill of a world boss.</div></div><hr />
