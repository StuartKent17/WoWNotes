Venruki's Teams to Watch <br />
Caster and esport personality Elliott “Venruki is a former World Champion and an established member of our analyst desk. Check out his to 5 teams to watch for the North America region below:<br />
<br />
#1<br />
Team Name: Method Black<br />
Roster: Snutz, Smexxin, Samiyam, Gorecki<br />
<br />
Snutz holds the most World Championship appearances of any North American player having placed top 3 five times since 2010. Last year was the first time Snutz played in a regional final and failed to qualify for the World Championship. For a player of his caliber, this was unacceptable and resulted in him going back to the drawing board. With a hand-sculpted roster, who currently sit 1st on the NA ladder, Venruki puts this team at Number 1.<br />
<br />
#2<br />
Team Name: Super Frogs<br />
Roster: Chanimals, Wealthyman, Mageiden, Kubzy<br />
<br />
Another all-star roster, Chanimals leads his frog army again with the addition of Mageiden for this year. Chanimals was the most recent North American representative to hold the World Championship, and he hopes adding Mageiden on the mage will free up Wealthyman in more of a multi-classing role. Utilizing his elemental shaman, they could run the Warlock-Shaman-Druid composition we saw XRB use to win Europe Cup #1.<br />
<br />
#3<br />
Team Name: Bologna Ponies<br />
Roster: Novoz, Thugonomics, Chunli, Vellido<br />
<br />
Formerly known as Splyce, this is one of the few rosters to stick together through the off-season. This team came 5th at BlizzCon last year utilizing Vellido and Chunli’s synergy as Windwalker Monk, Death knight. This composition is still strong, and with Thugonomics bringing his patented Destruction Warlock, this is a team that should be feared.<br />
<br />
#4<br />
Team Name: Method Orange<br />
Roster: Trill, Mes, Cdew<br />
<br />
Another strong cleave team, Trill and Mes are melee specialists. They’ve added Cdew for 2018 and hope to bank in his experience as a 3x BlizzCon competitor in return for that final acolyte all 3 of them are so hungry to achieve. As a fan favorite, these players are popular streamers and Venruki states this support can give them a home-town advantage. The roster is still hosting try-outs for a 4th to round out the squad, so watch this space!<br />
<br />
#5<br />
Team Name: The Rejects<br />
Roster: Jahmilli, Roastyz, Sethcurry, Rubcub<br />
<br />
Every off-season has sob-stories, but you wouldn’t think this is one looking at the roster. Each of the 4 players are considered some of the best of their class, and although they haven’t ever played together this makes them a real wildcard. Jahmilli led Tempo Storm to #1 in online competition last year, and if we learned anything from BlizzCon 2017, it was to never count out Rubcub.<br />

Its a really bad deal forcing you to pay for 6 month at this point in the game with nothing new coming for several months. Also. The mount looks like utter shit.<br />

<br />
Also &quot;sub I'm already paying&quot; what does mean? You have already six month covered? If yes -&gt; UNLUCKY<br />
If not -&gt; doesn't change nothing you pay now 6 months instead of subbing each month or 2 months.<br />
If you are paying with gold like me logic presume that you have enough gold to cover so..<br />

I would like to see a level and XP squish, meaning you would have to complete fewer zones on a continent, but you'd still get to finish a zone's story. Currently you don't get to finish every expansion's questing without hitting max level anyway. This won't fix it, it'll just make leveling easier for new players.<br />
<br />
Current:<br />
1-60 Classic<br />
60-70 Outland<br />

45-50 Pandaria<br />
50-55 Draenor<br />
55-60 Legion<br />
60-70 BfA<br />
<br />
The reason Blizzard hasn't reduced the amount of levels, is because they learned from Cataclysm that anything less than 10 levels for a new expansion wasn't satisfying enough. They could keep making new expansions 10 levels, and then half the amount of XP and zones you need by reducing it to 5 levels post-expansion. A year or so after Legion was released you could outlevel the Broken Isles by completing only half of the zones if you had heirlooms and did invasions.</div></div><hr />

<br />
These are my reasons for it:<br />
- The psychological aspect. It's just like the rested XP portrayal when wow first came out:<br />
rested XP used to give you 100% exp gain, while not rested gave you 50%. People didn't like that at all, so blizzard changed the text from 50% to 100% and 100% to 200%, without changing anything on the actual XP gain. People stopped complaining after that. 120 seems like a ridiculously high number to grind through. Making it smaller would probably bring same results as the rested XP change.<br />
- Talents &amp; Skills at every level, which makes a level-up more rewarding and therefore more fun.</div></div><hr />

I just like the idea of most levels coming with rewards, and right now we get a lot of levels with no character advancements. That feels bad.</div></div><hr />

More like 50 dollars, or less, in China. 11 a month, but the discount for 3+ months saves something, but I'm not sure how much.<br />

But 6 months during a drought is steep AF if you ask me.<br />

Currently you don't get to finish every expansion's questing without hitting max level anyway. This won't fix it, it'll just make leveling easier for new players.<br />
<br />
Current:<br />
1-60 Classic<br />
60-70 Outland<br />
70-80 Northrend<br />
80-85 Cataclysm<br />
85-90 Pandaria<br />
90-100 Draenor<br />
100-110 Legion<br />
110-120 BfA<br />
<br />
New:<br />
1-30 Classic<br />
30-35 Outland<br />
35-40 Northrend<br />
40-45 Cataclysm<br />
45-50 Pandaria<br />
50-55 Draenor<br />
55-60 Legion<br />
60-70 BfA<br />
<br />
The reason Blizzard hasn't reduced the amount of levels, is because they learned from Cataclysm that anything less than 10 levels for a new expansion wasn't satisfying enough. They could keep making new expansions 10 levels, and then half the amount of XP and zones you need by reducing it to 5 levels post-expansion. A year or so after Legion was released you could outlevel the Broken Isles by completing only half of the zones if you had heirlooms and did invasions.<br />
<br />
1~60 for the base game always felt like a weird, arbitrary choice, until I realized that Blizzard took all the older games in the Warcraft universe into account when deciding a maximum level for WoW at launch. Look what happens when you treat all Warcraft RTS games like prequel expansions:<br />
<br />
1. Warcraft: Orcs &amp; Humans - 1 ~ 10<br />
2. Warcraft II: Tides of Darkness - 10 ~ 20<br />
3. Warcraft II: Beyond the Dark Portal - 20 ~ 30<br />
4. Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos - 30 ~ 40<br />
5. Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne - 40 ~ 50<br />
6. World of Warcraft - 50 ~ 60<br />
~<br />
13. Battle for Azeroth - 110 ~ 120<br />
<br />
The only part of the complete list that looks weird is Cataclysm and Mists of Pandaria. If you give Pandaria a full ten levels, it's like Cataclysm wasn't even regarded as a real expansion, rather just a major systems overhaul that happened to include game content.</div></div><hr />

Yes, let's presume that they won't adjust the secondary stat weight to keep the overall % up so it wouldn't drop that harshly. <br />

I like how the maximum hero level in Warcraft 3 was 10 which also basically confirms this and that hero units can only gain 10 levels per game, basically meaning they can only gain so much combat experience per each large-scale conflict. Cata being described as just one big content patch is the best way to possibly describe it. If it didn't have raid tiers and new races charging us money for it would've been a joke. MoP had so much more meaty content in comparison.</div></div><hr />

I wish they'd stop doing this and actually REALIZE why it keeps happening. They keep making the same mistake over and over, and then falling back on the stat squish as a bandaid fix instead of dealing with the core issue that's causing it. Meanwhile, you can go 10, hell even 20 levels and an item has +1 stats on it. That isn't how it used to be.</div></div><hr />
