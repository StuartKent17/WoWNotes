Character Race Change now Available<br />
Players can now change their race for $25.00 USD (20€/15£ in Europe). <br />
The Race Change service lets you change a character's race to another race within their faction. The full range of customization options offered by the Character Re-Customization service is included as well. Each race change costs $25.00 USD. <br />
<br />
Things to know before you start:<br />
Under normal conditions, a race change should be ready immediately after rendering payment and completing the steps in this process.<br />
You can select a new character race only from those in the same faction that have the character's class available. You cannot change a character's class.<br />
A character's current home city reputation level will switch values with their new home city, and their home city racial mounts will convert to those of their new race. Refer to the Race Change Translation Table (https://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/race-change/index.xml) for more details.<br />
A realm transfer is not included in a race change.<br />
A character can change races once every 3 days.<br />
Please refer to the Character Race Change FAQ (http://us.blizzard.com/support/article/RCFAQ) for answers to common questions about this service.<br />

<br />
Race Change FAQ<br />
What is the Race Change service?<br />
Our Race Change service is designed to allow existing characters the opportunity to change their designated race while staying in their existing faction (Alliance or Horde).<br />
<br />
Can I use the Race Change service to change factions?<br />
No, faction changes are handled separately through our Faction Change service. For more information, visit the Faction Change FAQ. &lt;http://us.blizzard.com/support/article.xml?locale=en_US&amp;tag=FCFAQ&gt;<br />
<br />
How do I begin the Race Change process?<br />
To begin the Race Change process, please visit the Account Management page, select the Race Change option, and carefully follow the instructions provided.<br />
<br />
How much does this service cost?<br />
Each Race Change costs $25.00 USD (not including applicable taxes). This covers a single Race Change for a single character.<br />
<br />
Is this service taxed? If so, how can I tell if my purchase will be taxed?<br />
Players in select states in the U.S. may be subject to taxation when using our Race Change service. This list includes, but is not limited to:<br />
- New Mexico<br />
- Texas<br />
<br />
Can I change multiple characters' races at once?<br />
No. The Race Change service only allows one change per transaction. If you would like to change multiple characters' races, you will need to pay for each one separately.<br />
<br />
At what level can I change a character's race?<br />
Characters level 10 and above are eligible for a Race Change. Death Knights will be unable to change their race until level 60.<br />
<br />
Will this service allow me to customize a character and select a different name once its race has been changed?<br />
Yes. Each Race Change purchase will also provide the target character with an included re-customization and optional name change.<br />
<br />
Am I allowed to choose any race regardless of what class I play?<br />
No, the new race you choose must be compatible with your current class.<br />
<br />
Can I use this service to change the character back to its original race?<br />
Absolutely; however, this will require purchasing another Race Change.<br />
<br />
Will I be able to select Cataclysm races and class combinations for a character once they're available in game?<br />
Details are not available at this time. As development continues, though, we hope to provide more information.<br />
<br />
How often can I change a character's race?<br />
You may change a character's race every three days.<br />
<br />
What happens after I initiate a Race Change?<br />
Once your payment has processed and after you have remained logged out of the game for at least 30 minutes, you will see a new button to the left of the character's name upon next login. Clicking on this button will allow you to select the character's new race, as well as customize the character's look and name. These steps will greatly resemble the character creation process.<br />
To complete the Race Change, press the button labeled &quot;Click to change your character's race&quot; and confirm your selections. If you do not wish to change the character's race immediately, you may do so at a later time.<br />
<br />
What will happen to the character's old name? <br />
If you opt to change the character's name, the name will be locked from use on the realm for 90 days. You are not required to change the character's name, though; this is simply an option we provide included with the Race Change.<br />
<br />
What will happen to the character's equipment when I change its race?<br />
Equipment will be unaffected by the Race Change.<br />
<br />
What will happen to the character's mounts when I change its race?<br />
Mounts which are not considered race-specific will remain unchanged by this process. Race-specific mounts will be exchanged for a cross-race equivalent. You can view a full list of race-specific mounts and their equivalents here. &lt;need link&gt;<br />
<br />
What will happen to the character's non-combat pets when I change its race?<br />
Non-combat pets will not be affected by this process and will be available once the character's Race Change completes.<br />
<br />
What will happen to the character's achievements when I change its race?<br />
Achievements will remain unchanged by this process.<br />
<br />
What will happen to the character's titles when I change its race?<br />
Titles will remain unchanged by this process.<br />
<br />
What will happen to the character's reputation levels when I change its race?<br />
Upon changing races, the reputation level associated with the character's previous race will be switched with that of the character's new race.<br />
All other reputations will be unaffected by the change.<br />
<br />
What will happen to the character's quests when I change its race?<br />
Quests which are active in the character's log at the time of the Race Change will be cleared and all quest items associated with these quests will be destroyed.<br />
<br />
What will happen to the character's flight paths when I change its race?<br />
All flight points are unaffected by the change.<br />
<br />
What will happen to the character's &quot;Friends&quot; and &quot;Ignore&quot; lists when I change its race?<br />
The character's &quot;Friends&quot; and &quot;Ignore&quot; lists will be unaffected by the change.<br />
<br />
What will happen to the character's Guild and Arena team(s)?<br />
A character's Guild and Arena team will be unaffected by the change.<br />
<br />
Can I use the Race Change service if I am a Guild leader or Arena team leader?<br />
Yes. The character's Guild and Arena teams will be unaffected by the change.<br />
<br />
What will happen to the character's honor and Arena points?<br />
Any honor points, Marks of Honor, and lifetime honorable kills will not be affected by this process. Earned Arena points will carry over, as well; however, any pending Arena points accrued after the last maintenance period but before your Race Change is initiated may be lost.<br />
<br />
Where will the character be located after the Race Change is complete?<br />
Once the Race Change is complete, the character will be moved to the capital city of its new race.<br />
<br />
What will happen to the character's Armory profile?<br />
Once you have completed the Race Change process, the character's Armory profile will be updated to reflect any racial, gender, or name changes. Please note that our Armory system is still in beta at this time, so the character's profile may not immediately display the updated information.<br />
<br />
Will this service share a cooldown with the Character Transfer, Character Name Change, or Character Re-Customization services?<br />
No. The Race Change service will not share its cooldown with any of these services.<br />
<br />
Will this service share a cooldown with the Faction Change service?<br />
Yes. If you perform a Race Change, you will not be able to perform a Faction Change for three days.<br />
<br />
Can I purchase a Race Change for a character that has a pending Name Change or Re-Customization or is in the process of being transferred? <br />
No. Before you can initiate a Race Change for a character, please complete any pending Name Changes, Re-Customizations, or Transfers. These pending transactions will prevent you from initiating a Race Change.<br />
<br />
When will I be charged for the character's Race Change?<br />
You will be charged immediately upon pressing the confirmation button on the Race Change page.<br />
<br />
Is there any way to cancel a Race Change while the process is pending?<br />
Because your payment method will be charged immediately upon confirmation, you will be unable to cancel the process once you have pressed the confirmation button and the Race Change process is underway.<br />
<br />
Is there any way to reverse a Race Change once it's completed?<br />
No. Once a Race Change is done, it is permanent. You may, however, purchase another Race Change to switch back to the original race once the service cooldown time has elapsed.</div></div><hr />

I figured it'd be somewhere a number of days after Cataclysm, so they could do goblins and worgen at the same time.<br />
Along with the new race-class combinations.<br />

Interesting, will have to see how many people suddenly end up looking VERY different.</div></div><hr />

they changed the Realm transfer to 3 days a few weeks ago aswell, I recall it was for all those people who didn't like waiting 60 days if they failed their trial or didn't like the realm ect.</div></div><hr />

Orcs have massive shoulders. How do they see anything on either side of them? Orc warlocks are pretty cool too since they are the original warlocks lore-wise.</div></div><hr />

I think you'll still see a lot of Tauren Warriors and Orc Hunters.<br />

As for Alliance, you need to replace Human with Worgen. It is going to be a furry orgy Alliance-side in Cata.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I always thought tauren would be similar to their WC3 counterparts in looks that never came to fruition (their walk, totem weapons, lumbering bovine behemoth instead of a cow walking on 2 legs). Not to mention warstomp blows due to a cast time that can get pushed back that makes it only good for interrupting long cast time spells.<br />
<br />
So I get to be an orc with blood fury, extra expertise on axes, 5% more damage on spirit wolves, and new totem art.<br />
<br />
I'm happy spending that $25.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Which is precisely why it's set at $25- they don't want the entire world of warcraft suddenly switching their race every 3 days. The cost is a barrier to entry, it's not &quot;OMGAWD Blizz is sooo greedy captalizt&quot;, it's to set the marker at a place where you're obliged to at least THINK for a few minutes about whether you really want/need to change race, and only use the service sparingly where there's a compelling reason to change.

I hear a lot of &quot;omgz i was my same race and class since alpha when i played the black and white version on my citrus powered egyptian computer!&quot;<br />
<br />
Ok well, I've been night elf since closed beta. I only played night elf in Warcraft III and expansion. And the first second I'm able, I'm race changing to worgen! I hope they add an additional requirement such as reaching a certain level with worgen or goblin before a race change is allowed since they're new (much like the process of being allowed to make a dk). It should correspond with wherever their origin quests leave off and dump them into the main world (10-20). <br />
<br />
When the first expansion was announced, when I realized pandaren weren't going to happen, I started praying for worgen and was seriously let down. I've invested a stupid number of hours into this game for faction, raids, pvp, dumping huge amounts of cash into mount skills and engineering, all for one character that I have stood by with only one alt in all these years. And starting all over just to play a new race of the exact same class is enough for me to never even try it. I'm a full time student with a full time job and that seems overwhelming to me. It's not anywhere near &quot;fun&quot;. But being given the opportunity to play an old game in a new way that revitalizes everything for me when I'm about wow'ed-out is an awesome thing.<br />

Am I the only one who actually read the wall of blue text about the Race Change service? It's right there plain as day. The Race Change includes a character re-customization AND name change. Learn to freaking read already rather than posting asking stupid questions because you only read the headline.<br />
<br />
So for those that obviously have brains the size of their testicles - Race Change includes a name change, re-customization (sex change) and of course a race change.<br />
<br />
Edit: Does anyone actually believe that there won't be a restriction on the new race/class combination's come Cataclysm? Ever hear of Realm Firsts? Wouldn't quite be fair. They even hinted at it in the FAQ. They would have simply said &quot;yes&quot; you can change to a new race/class combination come Cataclysm if there wasn't going to be a cooldown on that part at launch.</div></div><hr />

Just because a company is partnered with another company doesn't mean they've taken over or have much of a say. Blizzard is still Blizzard and I'm pretty sure they do whatever the hell they want. If Activision ever tried to run Blizzard I'm sure they'd bail in a heartbeat.</div></div><hr />

Any honor points, Marks of Honor, and lifetime honorable kills will not be affected by this process. Earned Arena points will carry over, as well; however, any pending Arena points accrued after the last maintenance period but before your Race Change is initiated may be lost.<br />
Anyone care to explain that a bit easier, I .. I'm trying but I can't seem to get it, or well I'm not sure what they mean.<br />

I assume, if you change race after maintance you may loose your earned arena points that week or the week before? (Most likely the before)<br />

You quite obviously know less than squat about software development or relational databases if you think the two are basically the same. I would guess this was in development for a hell of a lot longer than 2 months, and in integration and internal user acceptance testing for even longer still. They might share a lot of code and were probably even developed in parallel, but saying they're basically the same is like saying a McDonalds burger is the same as a Gordon Ramsey prepared fillet mignon because they share the same constituent parts. Development and testing takes time- I don't think many players really comprehend how fucking awesome the Blizzard dev team are- I'm constantly amazed by the pace of the changes they put live, given what must be an immense codebase they have to work with and the huge potential for cocking it up every time they tweak stuff. I have nothing but the utmost respect for their team.</div></div><hr />

While I don't help feed people in Africa (or more accurately, feed the corrupt governments of Africa), I do donate money to my regional Food Bank on a regular basis.<br />
<br />
$25 is a drop in the bucket for a lot of people. Hell, that is two trips to Burger King or McDonalds. I will enjoy my virtual pixels and racial stats for far longer than a Big Mac sits in my colon. I think you'll find that people waste money on frivolous things all the time that have no more merit than virtual characters. <br />

WoW is very inexpensive entertainment.</div></div><hr />

How much money have you given to starving Africans? How many times have you been there feeding them? There's not many hippy chicks to impress here chief, no one is buying your benevolent holier than thou bullshit. I for one think it's better to spend $25 dollars to not be a gay blood elf than get food for Africans that's will be intercepted by a warlord.</div></div><hr />

Way the go, Blizzard. Overprice more.<br />
<br />
One of the reasons the fee is there is to discourage its use and abuse. Hey, it's working isn't it? THOUGH I would like that in one transaction you can change as many of your characters as you want instead 25$/character. I mean some of us have more than 1 character we care about.</div></div><hr />

Couple that with the fact that you will still play their game anyway, and you become a juvenile idiot.<br />
<br />
Congratulations.<br />
<br />
<br />
Pray tell, what about my post was &quot;juvenile&quot;? Would it be the fact I didn't elaborate to your degree of acceptability? Or perhaps it's because I focused on one aspect of the whole instead of making a new thread that could easily involve 6000+ words pointing out what the community and myself see as pros and cons of the WoW department of Blizzard Entertainment? Or perhaps it's that people like yourself jump at the chance to bash others because you can't see past your own shallow life to see that there are bigger pictures?<br />
<br />
Whatever the case, I can assure you of one thing, your misinterpretation of my post makes you look much worse than what you accuse me of.<br />
<br />
Will I still play WoW? When Cataclysm comes out, I will reopen my account. Until then, and for the past three, both of my accounts have been closed. the reasons I am taking a break are many, but you are a fine example of the part of the community that helped bring about that decision. Not that you, or anyone like you, care beyond having someone to bash.<br />
<br />
No amount of explanation would help you to comprehend what I was saying, however.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">skyesfury</div><div class="date">2009-10-28, 01:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You quite obviously know less than squat about software development or relational databases if you think the two are basically the same. I would guess this was in development for a hell of a lot longer than 2 months, and in integration and internal user acceptance testing for even longer still. They might share a lot of code and were probably even developed in parallel, but saying they're basically the same is like saying a McDonalds burger is the same as a Gordon Ramsey prepared fillet mignon because they share the same constituent parts. Development and testing takes time- I don't think many players really comprehend how fucking awesome the Blizzard dev team are- I'm constantly amazed by the pace of the changes they put live, given what must be an immense codebase they have to work with and the huge potential for cocking it up every time they tweak stuff. I have nothing but the utmost respect for their team.<br />
<br />
In regards to DB filing, they are almost identical. If you had training in database management beyond google searches, you'd know that. Take a college class or two on the subject.<br />
<br />
I can see where someone with limited understanding of context clues would make the mistake of misreading my first sentence. I'll clear it up for you. What exactly took 2 months --past the release of Faction Changes-- to make ready the release of Race Changes? In order to under that, however, you must first understand my previous point about database management.<br />
<br />
As for you analogy, it's not even close to the same thing. You're comparing two dishes that are not even prepared the same way, don't have the same ingredients beyond both being &quot;meat&quot; and are on almost entirely the opposite end of the quality spectrum in regards to meat entrees. A more proper analogy, and one that is quite accurate to further my point of the &quot;what took so long&quot; question would be: McDs Angus Deluxe burger vs McDs Angus Swiss Mushroom Burger. The are the same burger, but one has mushrooms while the other doesn't (and different cheese). So if the Deluxe came out 2 months after the Swiss Mushroom burger, what took so long to figure out how to change the cheese and lose the mushrooms?<br />
<br />
It's not just one thing that causes a decline in respect for the department. If it was, that would be petty. It's small thing after small thing after small thing. They add up over time and eventually it gets to the point where you just look at it and go &quot;How can you manage to screw that up where all the lesser MMO developers are getting it right?&quot; Communication (and often lack thereof) from Blizzard is the top issue on my list. Telling customers that not everything could be put into the patch notes on time isn't even a lame excuse. It's a straight up cop out for being lazy. You can't tell me the inter- and intra-office emails are that slow that the person posting the patch notes can't get the countless undocumented changes into them. That's not a symptom of being a large company, that's a sign of pure laziness. SOE has multiple MMOs and they manage to get all of the changes into the patch notes almost every single patch, every single game. Blizzard's WoW department can't manage to do that in the 1-3 weeks after PTR is shut down? That's just lazy. And that's just one example, other than the joke of an excuse they gave the public about race changes taking so long.<br />
<br />
If people would think for themselves instead of just accepting what they're told, we'd have a higher standard of communication from the companies we toss our hard earned money to. I don't know if you'll be able to understand what I mean, but I always keep hope that more people will stand up and think instead of just follow and accept.</div></div><hr />

Made a lvl 1 of each ingame, jumped around as each for a while + ctrl clicked t9 armor. Decided that they both lack the style and grace of a night elf so probably won't change. Just gonna leave the change pending lolz<br />

Blizzard is still Blizzard and I'm pretty sure they do whatever the hell they want. If Activision ever tried to run Blizzard I'm sure they'd bail in a heartbeat.<br />
<br />
<br />
Um they can't bail. Thinking that Blizzard can bail if they want show you do not understand how a merger works. He is the CEO. It isn't wrong that they want to milk it, but please do not be niave and think it is for the betterment of the game<br />
<br />
You really should read the link that both of us posted, here is a small piece, but it is ALL about milking games. <br />
<br />
&quot;Talking of $100m franchises, Kotick likes the way that World of Warcraft is heading. “The best of all margins – the 25 per cent operating margin business – has the potential as we can see with World of Warcraft to be a 50 per cent operating margin business. What used to be a low 20s return on invested capital business is now growing to a plus 40 per cent return on invested capital business.”<br />
<br />
And he’s not just setting his sights on Guitar Hero and WoW fans. Talking about upcoming and expensive Activision titles such as Modern Warfare 2, Kotick said: “if it was left to me, I would raise the prices even further.&quot;<br />
<br />
Once again business is about maximizing profits, but please understand the coorelation between him taking over and all these new &quot;PAID&quot; services.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, Blizzard is a company with the purpose of making money. But remember when Blizzard was also about making fun, innovating games? Well, that's exactly where Blizzard is headed away from. People like Kotick take something great, and ruin it simply to make profit.<br />

<br />
The racials are worth the money since pve raiding is very important to me and that little extra might help to get me closer to my goal DPS. Too each their own, but I feel this is a great option Blizz has added and one I will take advantage of.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;As for paid class change, Blizzard has already stated they're NEVER going to implement this - particulary not any change from one faction over to the other - so speculating about it is useless. Since they're not even considering paid sex-change, the possibility of paid class change is even more remote.&quot;<br />
