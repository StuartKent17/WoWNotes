<br />
<br />

<br />
Kalec will remain visible in the Mage Class Hall while the player is on or eligible for any of the class mount quests, even if he has been sent on a mission.<br />
Fixed a bug with spawning of the Silvermoon and Exodar marks for &quot;Hiding in Plain Sight.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />

Legion PvP Season 3 is ending soon, so we’d like to once again share what we can regarding the rating requirements to earn end-of-season rewards.<br />
<br />
Last season, we looked at what the rating cutoffs were at the time and used those to estimate where they would end up at the end of the season. We got a lot of feedback indicating that this was confusing, so for this season we’ll simply be providing the current cutoffs (at the time of posting) and updating them as regularly as possible. Note that we don’t consider posting cutoffs in this way to be a long-term solution, and appreciate your patience while we work on other methods of providing these updates.<br />
<br />
Again, the below rating requirements are current only as of the most recent update to this post, and we expect them to rise significantly before the end of the season. We will update these as regularly as we can over the next week; you can tell how recently these cutoffs have been updated by checking when this post was last edited.<br />

Estimated 3v3 Arena Cutoffs:<br />
<br />
Cruel Gladiator (Horde): 2730 Cruel Gladiator (Alliance): 2659 Gladiator (Horde): 2504 Gladiator (Alliance): 2456 Duelist (Horde): 2141 Duelist (Alliance): 2111 Rival (Horde): 1879 Rival (Alliance):1861 Challenger (Horde): 1610 Challenger (Alliance): 1598<br />

Elemental Discussions - 7.2.5<br />
In any case, I was posting to flesh out the numbers I presented earlier. Assuming we hit the 3rd tick breakpoint (which is reasonable in M+ assuming you use sephuz) then accounting for the loss of Seismic Storm procs then we're looking at Earthquake needing to be buffed to 92.5% per tick to be equal to live Earthquake.<br />
<br />
9 Live EQ procs at 60% = ~540% SP<br />
9 SS proc chances @ 728% SP per proc with the current 5% proc chance = ~327.6% SP<br />
<br />
Total average damage as SP per EQ on live = 867.6% SP.<br />
<br />
6 PTR EQ procs at 78% = 468% SP<br />
6 SS proc chances @ 728% SP per proc with the current 5% proc chance = ~218.4% SP<br />
<br />
Total average damage as SP after the change = 686.4% SP<br />
<br />
In order to bring these two numbers together, the damage per Earthquake tick needs to be brought from 65% per tick to 95.2% per tick assuming no other changes are made.<br />
<br />
If we assume that the average haste is low enough that you get 8 ticks instead of 9, the average live damage is ~680%. That would require that Earthquake is brought up to ~79.13% damage per tick (474.8% SP over 6 seconds) to be equal to live.<br />
<br />
Edit: I forgot The Ground Trembles &amp; Call The Thunder in my original calculations. The numbers above have been updated appropriately.<br />
A simpler way of arranging this, if I understand you correctly, is:<br />
<br />
You're assuming that a typical live EQ has either 8 ticks (33.3% haste) or 9 ticks (50% haste including a proc of some kind), instead of the baseline 6. In that case, you would argue for (generously) a 50% buff to EQ and Seismic Storm, but at the minimum a 33% buff?

different pool sizes/proportions.<br />
EU has either more players or a bigger gap in player skill (or both).</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's a certain percentage of the people. So let's say 0.5% of all the ranked people get gladiator. Based on that the cutoff is decided.</div></div><hr />

.... It’s getting Marks of the Sentinax. No one is opening portals anymore. None seem to spawn on their own. Sentinax farming groups are just freeloaders with no portal stones. The drop rate for portal stones and marks are pitiful. It was ok when people were ACTUALLY engaging with the Sentinax because of sheer volume .... but now there's no volume at all. It took me an almost an hour to get 4 marks on my alt. This needs to be addressed.</div></div><hr />
