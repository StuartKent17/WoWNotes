<br />
<br />
Update - Almost forgot about those, added something about the Pet Battle Masters. <br />
<br />
Tracking Pets<br />
The pet tracking changed slightly since our first preview, you now track 2 types of pets: the ones that you can't capture and are only here to let you gain XPs will show up as a small yellow dot on your map. The ones you can actually capture will show up with an easily noticeable green icon and will be flagged as capturable in their tooltip. <br />
<br />
<br />
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2012/april/petbattle_capturable.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2012/april/petbattle_capturable.jpg)<br />
<br />
<br />
Fight!<br />
The fight is started by right clicking a pet creature when you're in range (approximately 30 yards). The camera will rotate around your character and the game will switch to Pet Battle mode. From this screen you can:<br />
<br />
<br />
See the status of all your pets at the top left of your screen.<br />
Control the abilities of your active pet at the bottom.<br />
Switch between pets and see them by clicking the 4th icon on the bar. <br />
Capture pets when they're low on life! <br />
You can also surrender but that sounds pretty wimpy to be honest. <br />
<br />
The battle is pretty simple, weaknesses and strengths are already implemented and if you pick the wrong type of pet you will get your ass kicked pretty fast. It ends whenever the enemy is defeated or captured. <br />
<br />

Gotcha!&lt;/td&gt;<br />
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;<br />
<br />
Pet Battle Masters<br />
The Pet Battle System will also have fights against NPCs, some of the achievements datamined last night point to &quot;Pet Battle Masters&quot; that you have to defeat on every continent.<br />

<br />
Finding New Pets<br />
How are you going to know where to find new pets for your collection? Easy, Blizzard is going to integrate a full encyclopedia directly in the game. Maps aren't implemented yet but currently, the info page of any pet will already tell you where you can find it!<br />
<br />

Pet Battle Abilities<br />
If you missed the update last week, check out the updated list of pet battle abilities on WoWDB! <br />
<br />
<br />
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2012/april/petSkillNews.png <br />
<br />
The tooltips for individual (http://www.wowdb.com/pet-abilities/169-deep-breath) abilities (http://www.wowdb.com/pet-abilities/230-cleansing-rain) will show you which pets the attack is strong against, and which pets the attack is weak against. The page will also show you which pets can learn the abilities. On each pet's page (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/23811-jubling), we have listed all of the spells that the pet can learn. We will continue to add features as the system is fully implemented in the beta.<br />

<br />
I don't think Gamefreak will be chasing them with any lawsuits anytime soon. I mean. You can't really copyright Cockfighting. Though this Pet Battle System has some major similarities to pokemon. I don't particually see Blizzard making any animes or the such soon with it :P. <br />
<br />
They can't particually file for any damages because turn based combat is unique. animals fighting isn't unique and nor is capturing knocked out animals unique. :P</div></div><hr />

And pokemon didn't, on a Gameboy? This lets you go out into the vast world we already know and love and capture stuff. <br />

Early stages. Game won't be released until Sept at the earliest so we have 5 months of tweaking at least.</div></div><hr />

Yeah. Everytime someone does something I don't like, I ask myself that very same question. Why do they waste so much time on stuff I don't like when they can use that time to implement something I like. It just doesn't make sense.</div></div><hr />

I agree that it is nonsense, but I don't think it actually cut into the other areas of MoP development, as I'm pretty sure it was a side project that didn't involve any of the PvE or PvP content teams. It's also a one time development investment, in that once the basic system is in place, it won't take more than a small time investment to add new pets to it. I won't be using pet battles myself, though I think a little nonsense now and then is fine. I'll reserve judgement until I see how this addition affects the player base, which is the only way it will affect me.</div></div><hr />

My issue is that WoW has just took it's first step towards buying gear for your character.<br />
How? You can buy pets in the blizz store. I could arguably say that dragons are OP as are Water, Guess what you can buy in the store? Dragons.<br />

where you create a slightly asian themed animal character, which can do everything, including buy clothes and hairstyles, craft items using gathering skills and have pet battles<br />
<br />
the IGN review is saying good things ... <br />
&quot;After going through most everything the beta had to offer, including making stylish blue jeans, purchasing a Japanese garden, and getting a freaking T-rex as a pet, I can say that Hello Kitty Online is shaping up to be a pretty fun MMO for the younger, less battle hungry crowd. It's certainly not as in-depth as a major MMO is, but it provides a stylish environment with colorful characters and music that seems oddly epic for a game about cats and bunnies. While it seems like it'd be an ideal game for the younger demographic, I found plenty of adults playing it, too. HKO has the franchise appeal behind it to possibly make a hugely successful casual MMO.&quot;<br />
<br />

It is a complete waste of time except there will be millions of people playing this feature years from now. There are a TON of things that I think are stupid in the game right now, things I will never do.. yet it would be arrogant of me to assume that other people don´t enjoy them. I will give you a list.. Arenas.. the new challange mode heroics.... Morging... None of them are any interest to me at all, yet I can appreciate that other players may enjoy those types of things.<br />
<br />
But as for pet battles... just watch the freakin AH explode when ´leveled pets´ can be sold. You will see just how many people actually enjoy this feature.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The complainers came out to play today...<br />
<br />
Guild houses would be retarded. Blizzard wants people to hang out in the city, where they can view trade chat to buy stuff or find pvp, raids, or instances to go to. No one would hang out inside of a guild house. And how would guild housing look? An infinite land (or even worse, an instance), where there are thousands of houses... one for each guild. That's so stupid, boring and useless.<br />
<br />
World events are another story, but unless there is a pvp or pve benefit to doing it, most people won't do it and blizzard generally doesn't want to give huge bonuses (like the best weapons) to insignificant events.<br />
<br />
The pet battle system is a mini game to pass the time when you are bored, waiting for a raid, or waiting for a queue to pop. If you play wow, you'll play the pet battle system at some point. For some, the pet battle system will BE the game. For others, it'll be insignificant. It's just another facet. Like for example, I rarely pvp. I like the pve game enough to subscribe to raid. MOP looks fun.<br />

What rights. Pokemon isnt the only game that allowes you to catch pets or get pets and use them in battle. Monster Hunter (The game where you use cds to get monsters not the other game.) for example of this. Companies don't own rights over game mechanic.</div></div><hr />

<br />
People who do not raid and people who do not PvP. They are the ones who asked for it. You would be surprised at how many people do not raid and do not pvp, those faucets of the game are not the entire player base. Given some recent stats of a 6 million-sample size, only 38% or so of the sampled characters had done LFR, and significantly less normal and Heroic modes of DS and Firelands. PVP is probably even a smaller number. Demanding only content you enjoy is selfish and silly, there a lot of people who do not enjoy either and they deserve things to do as much as you do.<br />
<br />
If you were interested in PVP, they have put a lot of resources towards that as well with the two new maps/pvp match types (Murder Ball and Payload). As for balance they have rehauled all the classes and specs with new talent system and in some cases have rebuilt the class, making it easier to balance.</div></div><hr />

World Events: Well Blizzard is trying to add more World events but as Iphomiej said &quot;Most people won't do them unless they gain any benefit from them and Blizzard don't want to give huge bonuses to insignificant events&quot;, what types of World Events will we have, More PVP zones and the World Bosses :D<br />

Probably only a small percentage will ever try this shit. It would be better if they focused on something that has actually been requested by many, a large system, like housing, that will impact almost everyone.

It would be better if they focused on something that has actually been requested by many, a large system, like housing, that will impact almost everyone. We don't need more mini-games, we need mega-games, it's WoW coming to its end soon, they need to prepare to exit the stage in a large epic clash.<br />
<br />
An extremely large percentage will try this. Probably a good 20-30x as many then those who arena. Should we remove arena's? Even a great deal more then people who PVP, should we remove that too?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think this is the worst thing i have seen Blizz put in the game next to Achievments. <br />
<br />
They should focus on making hard content and balancing the game that they have.<br />
<br />
Here is the problem, people keep saying &quot;We want Hard content&quot; but if they got it, they will say &quot;We want to see the new content but is so hard that we can't get to the end of it&quot;, and also people say &quot;Balance class in PVP/PVE&quot; but.... then people will say &quot;There is nothing new, we are bored of the same things!&quot; and not even you know how to do that and you want Blizz to -Bring new things and at the same time balance everything?- and BTW for Hard Content we will have the Challenge Mode, so be happy, and Archivements?, you think they are stupid?, but well a lot of people like them, if you don't like something is ok, but don't assume that everybody hate it or that is just crap</div></div><hr />

Like how they removed skirmish, some used it, and not a single argument could defend why they removed it. We have random dungeon, random battleground, why the hell not random arena? Anyway, my beef comes with spending time implementing something that 1% might use, when they could implement something else which 20% would use inclusive that 1% community.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not to burst your bubble, but this will never happen. Maybe it makes a good theory, but in practice an unphased guild housing scenario like the one you described would ultimately discourage any new guilds from forming and since there is such a vast amount of players and guilds on any given server, what would happen when all of these 'lots' are taken? Is there a pecking order then? some kind of rent and mortgage the guilds must pay or be booted from the confines? I agree with you that player housing would be tight, and I am hopeful that the farming technique they are implementing in MoP will pave the way toward that, however anything like this must be phased to give everyone an equal shot or else you just end up with the longest running, most successful guild &gt; all, no questions asked, either join them or never get to enjoy that part of the game. And if that is the case, then the argument turns into why they would waste so much developing hours on such a system that only affects a tiny portion of the playerbase, unlike pet battles - or wowfarmville.</div></div><hr />

okay. player housing goes live. the 40 houses in orgrimmar go to the 40 guilds who did stuff on the ptr and know exactly which house to buy. 90% of those houses will be in the grasp of the guild forever. most of the people will be pissed that they can't have a house in orgrimmar and no one is happy except for the few guilds which got a house on patch night.<br />

try an instanced housing zone like in daoc. meaningless stuff. no one wants to hang out in these zones because it's too remote from the major cities. housing is a bad idea in general, imho.</div></div><hr />

Though i hate Pokemon the cartoon etc, the original gameboy game rpgs were quite fun and it seems like that is what blizzard is shooting for with the pet battles. I just dont see why people are so bitchy about this new feature i mean what the hell els you suposed to do with 150+ pets? if someone could think of a better system i would love to see it. and why re-invent the wheel when honestly the pokemon system works lol. WoW needed other more fun things to do aside from the typical agenda, level an alt, raid , dungeon etc and imo this is a great step in the direction. People act like this feature is the only big change in MOP, the fact they are adding this big system on top of everything els is quite impressive so like everything if you dont freaking like it go play something els.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When you see it as a permanent property, it would of course be bad. But maybe the houses could be owned by a guild for a fixed timespan; after this every guild on the server can try to get this house. Much like an auction. There would be a few representative houses (Valley of Honour for example) and a lot of smaller ones. Or there could be a mixed approach: If you absolutely want a guildhome but all slots are taken you can get an instanced one for little money. I don't know, there are a lot of possibilities to implement such a thing. <br />
<br />
BTW: No one is bursting my bubble by telling me that there will never be Guild/Playerhouses in WoW. I know that this things will never make it in the game. My point was: There are a lot of other features closer related to the core of an Online-Roleplaying-Game than these childish pet-battles. I am an Axe-swinging, blood-drinking, cursing, stinking Orc in 50kg of plated armor. I slay Demons, Dragons, Fallen Gods, Titans and Things That Have No Name. And now i get the ability to... send in my pets.</div></div><hr />

It's a bug, the Pet Battle implementation seems to have wiped out everyone's pets... makes me wonder how one is supposed to test it (Unless we go out and catch 'em all!) when Blizzard has wiped the PokeDex clean.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Butter Emails</div><div class="date">2012-04-25, 07:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I personally like housing, but a few reasons why it'll probably never be seen in WoW:<br />
<br />
1. Non-instanced or non-phased housing in the wide open world will make the ability to get a house on highly populated realms extremely difficult. If anyone remembers early Ultima Online housing, housing PROPERTY was worth more than the house itself. A small house deed was worth 45k gold, but a small house placed on a plot of land could go for anywhere from 100k to several million depending on where it was located. Because of house decay, there were people that made money just off of poaching spots where houses had decayed completely and selling those pieces of property. It would create an interesting market dynamic in WoW but would almost certainly be a toy only for the rich. Plus, it makes the &quot;wilderness&quot; suddenly seem very &quot;settled&quot; and no longer like wilderness.<br />
<br />
2. Instanced and phased housing like other games makes housing almost become meaningless. Sure, you can buy and decorate a house, but nobody's going to care because nobody but the friends you badger to check out your house will ever see it. In the end, instanced and phased housing is just a glorified void storage system, or other kind of extended bank service.<br />
<br />
I have no doubt that blizzard will eventually implement player housing as one of those ways of bringing people back. Much like WoW pet battle system is a pokemon extension of the game, a housing system would just be The Sims: World of Warcraft.</div></div><hr />

Sorry but i am with blizzard on this one, people need to get out and explore more instead of sitting in town for hours and development time is better spent elswhere.

When I win it gets XP but any XP after the inital 50 does not count anymore, so after like 10 wins it's still level 1 für my critter.<br />
Catching pets also does not work, they are just not showing up.<br />
<br />
As for the error #132 - just make sure you are alone in the zone to have a few minutes to test...</div></div><hr />

Bring on Guild Wars 2, I'm tired﻿ of this bullshit.<br />
<br />
You'll most likely disappointed then since Guild Wars and Arenanet have often featured/supported minigames such as this, it's called Polymock. And considering Guild Wars 2 already includes several minigames within the major towns and outpost, I wouldn't be surprised if Polymock or a similar pet/miniture battling system will be implemented in Guild wars 2 eventually.</div></div><hr />

My issue is with the fact that this is not creative way to spend your developement time. <br />
<br />
When I already have a Pokemon game within my fingertips on handheld I can fire up in seconds to get superior experience to this on this front, it seems absurd I'd even want to test it out. Blizzard should try to churn in something unique mini games that fit onto the game and it's themes, instead of ripping off other things that are already so easily accessible the whole thing just gives a sensation of &quot;Pointless&quot;</div></div><hr />

I'm really looking forward to playing with it while just chatting with guildies, waiting for groups, etc. I can even see me logging in to do just this when I don't feel like working on anything else. I've got over 160 pets and this will give me something more to do with them! The closest we get to &quot;using&quot; them now is when you stumble across another collector and start pulling them out to see which one of you has the one the other really wants but just hasn't been able to obtain.<br />
<br />
For those of you who think that this wasted raid or instance development time, I truly hope you don't think that the same team does both. It's been stated time and time again that it's different groups working on different aspects of the game. I'm sure I've even seen blue posts refuting the assertion that the pet battle team is drawing assets away from raid development (although I have no interest in launching a research project to prove it beyond doubt).<br />
<br />
Actually, all the complaining about this reminds me of all the people who complained about the waste of time that Transmog was. Transmog turned out to be HUGE and I think this will follow its success. I understand this isn't going to appeal to a lot of people. I guarantee you there is not a single thing in WoW that appeals to 100% of the player population, but this is going to be used by a lot more than just &quot;1% of the playerbase&quot; I saw someone say earlier in this thread.<br />
<br />
Also, I haven't seen it brought up much but this has the potential to create a new revenue stream for those of us that want to buy all of the shiny new mounts. One must arrive at their pet battles in style, after all! ;)</div></div><hr />

That's horsecrap. Pets were always something to follow you around and look cute, nothing more... well also bragging rights. They're even named Non-combat Pets. If people were requesting since 2004 for them to do something, sure they were in the vast minority and they were also not raiders or PvPers. Raiders and PvPers tend to keep their pets stashed away for some reason, usually because it crowds the screen with more crap.<br />
<br />
Well it is a Teen title, rated T for Teen, and it's being tailored to that age group more and more with each successive expansion. I can respect that today's teenagers are more interested in Pokemon than most other things offered, afterall there's not much else for the average teenager to do in game because guilds tend to not let under 18 raid. With this they are now offering something for all the teenagers that were left out and that's a positive thing.<br />

If they implement Animal Crossing in the future however, I'm out forever.</div></div><hr />

No one's making fun of anyone. All I've said was that this was a colossal waste of development time. Instead of implementing features that would make the game better and actually brings some subscribers back, the geniuses at Blizzard come up with this garbage.</div></div><hr />

This is much better than most of the other demanded features from disgruntled players I've seen on the forums.<br />

Let me guess, you're one of those people who think getting rid of LFR/LFD and making raid content inaccessible to casuals is going to be what brings subscribers back to WoW.<br />

I was expecting a quick, cheezy, battle system outside of raids and around Org/SW.

The amount of emotion caused by these new features just shows how much the game is changing from the form a lot of long-time players have enjoyed and enclosed in our hearts (dont know if there is such a saying in english).

People who call it childish have a very narrow and close minded view. You already play a cartoony game full of silly humor. Those who even play the actual pokemon games are not nessearily any more childish than anyone playing this game.<br />

In my time playing Pokemon at its end game competitive level and interacting with that community Ive seen far more mature behavior on a regular basis than I -ever- see in a typical pug, trade chat or any other populated area. <br />

Developer: &quot;I don't see how.&quot;<br />
<br />
Announcement: &quot;Pet battles!!!! That's fun, right?&quot;<br />
Kids: &quot;Yeah!!!!&quot;<br />
Others: &quot;WTF?!?&quot;<br />
<br />
Kids in beta: &quot;This is awesome!&quot;<br />
Beta participants who aren't kids: &quot;WTF?!?&quot;<br />
Developers: &quot;I have to debug the pet battles? Kill me, please.&quot;<br />
Me: &quot;WTF?!??<br />
<br />
As others have said....this is a gigantic, monumental, colossal waste of development time.<br />
<br />
Are you really expecting people will run around collecting, training and battling pets and consider that fun?<br />
<br />
PETS?!?<br />
Oh man, the irony that this showed up right under my post.<br />
<br />
People alread yrun around collecting the pets. Why wouldnt they utilize another method to show them off to each other? I'd be willing to bet real money that more people actively participate in the pet collecting community than in the arena community.</div></div><hr />

It's gonna be even more hilarious laughing at you people with your bonsai panda's while you hunt the the pokemons. So from the great start of wow we go in to the amazing bc era and then we quickly begin going down hill in wotlk because of the p[iece of shit casuals needing every thing dumbed down from them. Then we go in to cataclysm which was nice to be honest and then continue the same lame garbage for the piece of shit casuals having trouble putting effort in to the game(Fire lands continuous nerfs anyone?) and reused maps. After all that we go in to cutsey let have a hug bonsa panda hunting pokemon? LOLOLOL.. Yeah fanboys, enjoy your extra lame game because &quot;its the lore&quot; and it will be a wonder why every other game will crush that garbage.<br />
<br />
jees somone call the waaambulance. look guy take it easy. WoW is moving along with the gaming meta of being more user friendly and less of a freaking chess match where one mistake costs you greatly. i understand that you want the glory days were you would spend 3 weeks farming boss number 2 of a raid and feeling accomplished because you were the only person on your server that did this. but take a step back and think of if thats a good game design. if you say that it is then im sorry you are a fool. people play a GAME to get some enjoyment out of it not to die over and over again for 2% or 3% dps needed to kill something so meaning less as an in game boss. the weeks that you spent dieing on one or even 4 bosses is in most peoples eyes a waste of time. shit shouldnt be so hard to kill for little rewards. <br />
<br />
the game is moving into a new design of content being easier for most people to kill on normal mode and significantly harder on heroic mode for you elitests and this is coming from somone whos been a raider since bc and been doing heroics at content level since wrath so i know a thing or 2 about progression raiding. i dont know what vanilla was like besides from what ive heard and from some of the long time raiders i hear from vanilla was pretty shitty for raiding fi you werent in the number one guild on your server.</div></div><hr />

I'm just curious in how a game where you capture animals with the sole purpose of using them to fight battles with other animals was deemed as childish from the start. <br />
<br />
I'm really not sure where the ridiculous mentality came from that deemed Pokemon childish. The anime, maybe, but the game itself? Maybe it's the handheld aspect of it? Though that shouldn't have anything to do with the game.<br />
<br />
I can say Mario is extremely more childish then Pokemon is.</div></div><hr />

From the company that developed it and marketed it at children? Not saying adults can't enjoy it, but it's much the same as My Little Pony as far as that goes.<br />
<br />
Personally I don't care if it's considered childish, if it's fun. But then, one of my favorite games has always been Earthbound, and aside from the unspeakable horror at the end it was childish through and through (heck, Ness even kinda looks like Ash). Fun, though.</div></div><hr />

As for those saying it's immature etc, I think most ppl are blinded by the &quot;pokemon&quot; concept, although it looks childish the games have much depth, it would be awesome to see that depth in these pet battles.<br />
I think they could turn out to be really meaningful instead of just a time waster while queueing. I could see something like arena competition happen with these battles if it turns out to be a loved feature.<br />
<br />
just my 2 cents</div></div><hr />

No, it's not. It's always valid that Pokemon was developed as a children's franchise. That doesn't mean that periphery demographics can't enjoy the game, of course. But if you allow them to define the game, there's no such thing as a &quot;children's game&quot; in existence, anywhere. Adults sufficiently motivated can conjure a min-maxed endgame out of any game they wish. That doesn't mean the game wasn't developed, pitched, and/or generally understood as a children's game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Everything in WoW is a waste of time. It has not baring or rewards for real life. But, like many of you, I have many extra hours in a day to waste, and this is more fun and safer than other options.<br />
<br />
Years ago, when I was discovering MMOs, I thought, &quot;I'd love a Pokemon MMO. I would play that.&quot; Bam, Blizz did it before Nintendo, plus it's built right into a game I already play. And I already collect pets.<br />
<br />
It is a lot more interesting than other things they've put in (Archeology, Fishing, farming rep or mats). It's easy enough when you're waiting by the summoning stone for a raid, waiting for people to be ready, to just pet duel your guildies. It's customizable so you can use the pets you like. <br />
<br />
And it is not necessary for gearing. It's not like rep farming, where you have to be exalted with certain factions to get that one piece of gear, or that one enchant, or fishing to get what you need for the best feasts. It's just for fun, and if it's not your cup of fun, it doesn't impact you at all.<br />
<br />
Quit hating, and leave pokemon/pet battle lovers alone.</div></div><hr />

WoW is marketed to teenagers. Who are not adults, and therefore children, or if you prefer...kids.<br />

Here's the thing, i didn't know we could ask for that. I wanted it, I just didn't know that I wanted it. I'm glad Blizzard told me.<br />
<br />
I was thinking, following up this, we could have a &quot;collectible card game&quot; within WoW. Yes, I'm talking Yu-Gi-Oh style. As is, there are cards. Inscriptionists can make them. Mobs and bosses drop them randomly (the old decks). You could put decks together around stuff that already exists in teh game, so someone has a murloc themed deck and so on. They could tie cards in with the real CCG. It would be amazing, and if Battle Pets goes off well, that may be a next step.<br />
<br />
And for those saying this is childish, I'm in my mid thirties, I played Pokemon back in teh day, and then later played it with my kids (both on GameBoy/DS, and the card game).</div></div><hr />

People have been asking for something to do with the pets they have collected for years. That's just a fact.<br />
How can anyone complain about having a pet battle system when there are idiotic people out also asking for a dance studio? That idea is the worst I've ever heard for WoW. Except player housing of course.<br />
<br />
The fact is that people are complaining about it before they have really tried a finished product.<br />
There was sooooo much complaining about MoP until the beta went live and people could play it. As far as I can see, there is now a severely reduced amount of hate for MoP. Everything I've played of it so far has been pretty damn awesome! Pet battles are just another thing for the people that want to complain to latch on to so that they can do so.<br />
<br />
The Pet Battle System has taken no time away from development of raids or zones or anything like that. It's being done by the UI team that don't have so much to do. The sooner people have the brains to finally accept that, the better.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I didn't realize that Kung Fu Panda invented both Panda's, Kung Fu, and the Chinese culture. &gt;.&gt;<br />

Every single thing in this expansion can only be deemed as childish if you have that mentality yourself. Panda's certainly aren't childish, neither is the Chinese culture (seriously? One of the LEAST childish cultures out there), animals fighting each other to near death, or even farming for that matter.</div></div><hr />

I can't wait to use Mr Wiggles to kick some tail. I am glad I took the time to try it out before I assumed that it was what the qqers deemed childish.... This will defiantly pass time before raids and I might can get my fiancé to play the game now. Yes people has a right to their opinions but if you think about it complaining wont take it out so it looks like to me your stuck with pet battles enjoy! :D.</div></div><hr />

Instead of coming up with something awesome like dynamic world events, guild houses, etc., we get this crap. What a complete waste of development time.<br />
Right, this only proves that different people have different desires. Name one non-RP guild that wants a guild house instead of a new raid. That's right, none.</div></div><hr />

Still pet battles is a meh for me, I've never been a capture battle gamer. Didn't get into Monster Rancher, Pokemon, etc and I don't really care much for the pet aspects of classes that have them in any game. Warlock is really the only class I've ever played heavily, not just a few campaigns or for the sake of leveling, in near 20 years of RPG playing that has a pet that they &quot;rely&quot; on in a fashion. Most of warlock pets were either on a target doing a single attack in pve or the rare CC occasion. Still pet battles does give me one thing I wanted from this game years ago and that is the ability to trap critters and make them non-combat pets. Always thought that was a neat idea, but nothing more. Battling them has little allure to me, I'd rather farm mats of Fish..then again most raiders don't even want to help farm mats, guess they have something to do while I gather their fish feast and flasks...</div></div><hr />

Am I mad? nope. It looks fun. The pokemon games were and still are fun. Why not use this idea. It is about time we got to use those things.<br />
My issue is that WoW has just took it's first step towards buying gear for your character.<br />
How? You can buy pets in the blizz store. I could arguably say that dragons are OP as are Water, Guess what you can buy in the store? Dragons.<br />
<br />
Stinks to say it but this is the end of working to get things. At the same time I'm glad to see that you can finally buy your way through it all.<br />

You mean to tell me ya'll will go out and do something as stupid as archaeology, but pet battles are a joke? Right NOW..your pet does nothing. Absolutely nothing but follow you around and do a corny animation every now and then. The UI team developed a way to change that and bring the pets we've been collecting since forever to life..and all you guys have to do is bicker and complain, and cry..and wish for player housing, and hell maybe we could have actual professions where we go to work for 9 hours... then we can build some clubs in goldshire and have happy hour together. Stop being so pathetically pessimistic, if you don't support the game, then just say it and find another that suits you. Don't sit there and sugarcoat your reasoning with b.s. What I am gathering is everyone sees pet battles and says 'damn you blizzard this is hurting our raids' when in all actuality you have yet to even see any of that content...because the game hasn't even been in BETA that long.</div></div><hr />

You say it's a massive waste of development time when everyone forgets about a raid after they do it for 6 months. The other 'wasted' development like transmogrification actually encouraged people to go back into old raids to get nice looking gear. You think that pet battles will last longer and be played for longer than 6 months? I sure think so.</div></div><hr />

Because everyone is going to buy a € 65 game with a € 15 monthly fee to play pokemon. And this is NOT pokemon.<br />

Must feel awful to put in such a nice minigame as a favour to the community who feel like there's no incentives to go out in the world, and they add the most fitting and incentive there is, finding and catching critters that exist in literally every zone in the game.<br />
Then adding leveling to that.<br />
Duels between players<br />
Duels against &quot;masters&quot; across the continents.<br />

Some players just can't seem to appreciate anything, and since you never provide constructive feedback you're the reason the community stinks.</div></div><hr />

No I pay for the PvE content, raiding and whatnot.<br />

This is just a mini-game. You see, it comes WITH the subscription fee.<br />

I prefer to pay for glorified chatrooms. (trade) which I will sit in for hours.<br />
<br />
I pay for the ability to walk in the same circle for hours and hours clicking on the same nodes over and over.<br />
<br />
I pay for standing in one spot for a half hour to get into something that will fail after 15 minutes, just to wait again.<br />
<br />
<br />
Why in heavens would I pay for a mini game that might have some strategy in it? Why would I want more options of things to do?</div></div><hr />

raiding, pvp, dungeons, pet battles, tillers, challenge modes, scenarios and possibly racing in one MMORPG!? oh yeah no one will pay for that /sarcasm. the game is getting bigger and better now with this expansion. Blizzard can see now that players want variety instead of just more raids/dungeons/arena/battlegrounds.<br />

Thats a nice addition imo, if you dont like it, well, dont use it? Why complain about that since its only meant to pass time and have fun... This expention was already bashed before it was even first announced at Blizzcon, thats stupid... I've been in the beta, the new talent system is really great, especially in pvp where you wont be able to know exactly who you are facing. Its not perfect i know theres some flaws like everything else i guess... The zones graphics.... OMG, they're really nice looking! I didnt try to level yet i dont have time for it atm =/ but i cant wait to level my main in there!

A lot of people did archaeology for the 359 items<br />
but since archaeology was left behind no one does it anymore.<br />

Pet battles are timeless, and no doubt over half the playerbase will do it to some extent. More than one could say about arenas and normal raiding</div></div><hr />

pet battles don't pigeon hole you into a specific area then send you to another and another and so on... with pet battles you go where there's a pet you want, an npc you want to challenge or just a zone you like the look of to battle in with wild pets.</div></div><hr />
