Cataclysm Video - Mulgore<br />
Another video from TotalBiscuit (http://www.youtube.com/user/TotalHalibut) today, with a short tour of the revamped Mulgore in Cataclysm! <br />
<br />
PS: I'm always looking for more videos, don't hesitate to send me a PM about it. Nice videos, of course. And please, don't post 10 mins+ videos in multiple parts if your youtube account doesn't support it, I can't really post that without making super-long news posts.<br />

The greatsword of the brotherhood has returned.<br />
<br />
And on another note<br />
<br />
WHERE ARE THE SKYWALL WEAPONS OH GOD.<br />
<br />
Also, to the people who think all the weapons look dark and evil and boring because of that... the Bastion of Twilight raid looks like the weapons. The Blackwing Descent raid looks like the weapons. And moreover, with all the weapons on a black background, they just look that dark. Could somebody put the weapons on a fairly light neutral grade background just to help me prove my point? &gt;.&gt;</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, a couple of them look like ICC epics. But I can let them get away with it because they have made lots of designs.</div></div><hr />

Swords have to look like swords, hammers have to look like hammers etc. So if you've got a game that's been running for quite a few years with lots and lots of weapons to it, chances are they will look similar to what you've already seen at some point.<br />

How many of those different colors of each weapon will we see in the game? One? Two? We certainly won't see all of them. It's no wonder models don't get updated.<br />
<br />
I know it's not a lot of man hours per item, but it is a lot of man hours when it's all added up.<br />
<br />
And before some artist (or arm-chair artist) comes along and claims it's just a matter of changing the color on one thing, you have no right to call yourself an artist if you make that claim.<br />

I beg to differ. http://www.wowhead.com/item=49981 The crossbow bears a striking resemblance to Fal'inrush and the bow looks a bit like Zod's though admittedly cooler with Deathwing's visage there. Either way they seem a bit...off. Not bland but not as unique as they could be I think. Just my opinion though</div></div><hr />

I think these weapons are pretty nice. Ashkandi is an obvious nod, but I'm missing where everyone else is saying &quot;ZOMG THEY ARE ALL THE SAME AS BEFORE&quot; ... I'm not seeing it. Also, don't you think that most of the items should kinda be a semi throw-back for the Blackwing Descent raid? I mean, Blackwing Lair? (Also, I just had a vision of those humanoid-dragons and all their alchemical gear being parts of new &quot;lab packs&quot;... no... oh God, no... *has flash backs, convulses on the floor*)<br />
Ahem.<br />
It's still a pretty gothic feel to the weapons. Sure, they've got a much brighter-colored glow, but overall they seem to be dark metal and fire.<br />
Also, maces. Maces maces maces. Delicious mace models. Pleeeeeese let that dwarven-like mace be a one handed tanking mace. Nom nom nom... nom.</div></div><hr />

<br />
*...Well, actually since I pre-ordered and we were fourth in line, we ended up finalizing the purchase at around three minutes till midnight, they just wouldn't let us leave the store with the boxes (one Collector's Edition, one regular so Zeph and I could both play) until the clock struck twelve.<br />
<br />
...the point of all this is I've been up for a long time and it's 6 in the morning Pacific time and I need to get SOME sleep before tonight's raid. Which I hope we'll actually have people for rather than seeing a bunch of names pop up as playing Starcraft 2 when they're scheduled to be in Icecrown Citadel.

<br />
Certainly not as the first legendary (I'm well aware that DPS casters need love), but at some point this expansion a 1H axe would be awesome. Now that Fury will have a viable 1H spec (in theory anyway), it'll be probably the most usable legendary weapon ever. Enhance Shaman, Frost DK, Fury Warrior, Combat Rogue, and as a bonus (maybe) Hunters will all have a nice legendary. Essentially every melee class in the game will have one spec that can use it except Druids and Pallies (Technically Pallies could use it, but it'd be awful).</div></div><hr />

Please Gtfo. Your opinion of these weapons is retarded. These weps look great and have a great imagination. There giant and they resemble BWL from Vanilla. To all of you people who keep saying these models are just copied and pasted from other models please gtfo aswell. These models look brand and new, there texture quality is much more definite than any other models in the entire game. Blizzard gets a +1000 stars for me.</div></div><hr />

Your opinion of these weapons is retarded. These weps look great and have a great imagination. There giant and they resemble BWL from Vanilla. To all of you people who keep saying these models are just copied and pasted from other models please gtfo aswell. These models look brand and new, there texture quality is much more definite than any other models in the entire game. Blizzard gets a +1000 stars for me.<br />
<br />
What a mature answer. So according to you I'm not entitled to my opinion because YOU think it's retarded? You must be about 12 years old. Doesn't surprise me that the colour schemes appeal to you.</div></div><hr />

Weapons from BWL were phenomenal. <br />
...<br />
Why does everything nowadays HAVE to have a glow on it?<br />
I know someone else posted and was a bit of an arse, but I do want to try to try and be professional about this.<br />
<br />
I don't know. I'm looking through the drops of BWL because my mind is hazy, and these items are still rather... I don't know what word to use. Showy? Kinda glowly? High Fantasy, in general,I guess is a good description.<br />
<br />
Ashjre'thul, Crossbow of Smiting (http://www.wowhead.com/item=19361); Crul'shorukh, Edge of Chaos (http://www.wowhead.com/item=19363); Heartseeker (http://www.wowhead.com/item=19350). I mean, these things aren't exactly traditional in any sense. Actually, Edge of Chaos looks a little silly to me, looking at it now.<br />
Hahaha, I just came across this one again. Corn on the cob staff (http://www.wowhead.com/item=19355), goooo!<br />
<br />
Now, I will admit, there were more simple-looking peices, such as Alcor's Sunrazor (http://www.wowhead.com/item=14555), but I thought that was just downright... bland.<br />
<br />
The point that I'm trying to make is that realistic weapons typically aren't that exciting to look at. It's supposed to be a bit showy and flashy. Some of the items in the previews Boubille posted, sure, I'm not fond of. But overall I'm pleased-- much like BWL loot. There's some great, memorable stuff, and then there's... Well, there's the corncob. Which, by the way, is a recoloring of... the OTHER corn-on-the-cob staff (http://www.wowhead.com/item=20581).<br />
<br />
Just give it some time. When we see the gear, and the full dunegon itself, we may find that it works out pretty well.<br />
<br />
Hee hee. Corn on the cob.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think the problem is that generally, the weapons themselves are dark &quot;metal&quot;, stone, or otherwise. They have spikes and chains on them, and thus they have a gothic feel, much like WOTLK weapons. On the other hand, the details on many of the pieces are bright, brillant colors. So I'm guessing half of the folks don't like the gothic part, and the other half don't like the bright detail...<br />
This is all a prime example of, &quot;you can't please all of the people some of the time&quot;. Oh well. :/</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DrgnDancer</div><div class="date">2010-07-27, 06:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">To paraphrase Abraham Lincoln: You can please some of the people all of the time, all of the people some of the time, but fuck the WoW community, you'll never please those bastards. Everyone who dislikes these models, look at the other posts. Somewhere around half or a bit less of the group likes the models. So Blizzard &quot;succeeded&quot; there, someone does in fact like this stuff as it's being designed. It's hard to argue that Blizzard has &quot;failed&quot; when a good percentage of their customers like what they're doing. <br />
<br />
&quot;But!&quot; you say, &quot;if they do it the way I want them to do it. Some of those people will still like them, but they'll also get all the people who agree with me!&quot; <br />
<br />
Now look at the people that dislike the models. About half of them think they models are too boring, the other half think they're too &quot;unrealistic&quot;. Now realism and creativity in weapon designs are almost mutually exclusive goals. At the very least they aren't likely to intersect very often. So either direction Blizzard moves in is likely to further alienate the people who want the other goal. You starting to see the problem here?<br />
<br />
Add to this the fact that Blizzard has now had to come up with something in neighborhood of a hundred or so variations on each weapon class, and probably hopes to have to do at least 50 or so more variations before the game dies, and you start to see that trying to come with new, unique models that will please anything like everybody is an impossible task. What you like is not what the guy next to you likes, and if what either one of you likes is too similar to something they've already done, they probably can't do it anyway.<br />
<br />
Blizzard doesn't fail, or suck, or have all new all terrible designers. They have about 11 million people they have to try and please with probably 100,000 or so variations on what they consider &quot;awesome&quot;. They also have a huge historical archive of old stuff that they can't come too close to copying or everyone will cry. If you don't like the designs, you'll probably just have to deal with it.<br />
<br />
For the record, I don't like the designs all that much. They're &quot;OK&quot;, but not the direction I'd like to see things move (I'm in the &quot;make them look a little more like 'real' weapons camp&quot;). I don't think Blizzard's designers are horrible failures, &quot;11 year old Filipinos with one kidney&quot; (WTF was that about by the way), or not trying because they've all moved on to the new MMO. I think they're designing for tastes slightly different than mine. I can deal with that. It happens. It doesn't exactly ruin the game that I wish my sword model had fewer glowy bits.</div></div><hr />

I don't know. I'm looking through the drops of BWL because my mind is hazy, and these items are still rather... I don't know what word to use. Showy? Kinda glowly? High Fantasy, in general,I guess is a good description.<br />
<br />
Ashjre'thul, Crossbow of Smiting (http://www.wowhead.com/item=19361); Crul'shorukh, Edge of Chaos (http://www.wowhead.com/item=19363); Heartseeker (http://www.wowhead.com/item=19350). I mean, these things aren't exactly traditional in any sense. Actually, Edge of Chaos looks a little silly to me, looking at it now.<br />
Hahaha, I just came across this one again. Corn on the cob staff (http://www.wowhead.com/item=19355), goooo!<br />
<br />
Now, I will admit, there were more simple-looking peices, such as Alcor's Sunrazor (http://www.wowhead.com/item=14555), but I thought that was just downright... bland.<br />
<br />
The point that I'm trying to make is that realistic weapons typically aren't that exciting to look at. It's supposed to be a bit showy and flashy. Some of the items in the previews Boubille posted, sure, I'm not fond of. But overall I'm pleased-- much like BWL loot. There's some great, memorable stuff, and then there's... Well, there's the corncob. Which, by the way, is a recoloring of... the OTHER corn-on-the-cob staff (http://www.wowhead.com/item=20581).<br />
<br />
Just give it some time. When we see the gear, and the full dunegon itself, we may find that it works out pretty well.<br />
<br />
Hee hee. Corn on the cob.<br />
<br />
Ooh don't get me wrong I have no problem with the weapons looking outlandish and not realistic. But if you look at the weapons in BWL they all look great yet they don't have a neon glow to them. <br />
If they even have a glow at all it's very very subtle. And that's what I miss. <br />
<br />
The same goes for weapon enchants. Over the years they've become more and more shiny and oversized. I mean who thought of the spell power on staff enchant? That shit is epilepsy inducing. That subtle green glow from agility on weapon back in Vanilla was awesome. It enhanced your weapon but didn't hide the design unlike things like mongoose or executioner.</div></div><hr />

Knowing what these weapons look like makes me worry with what the hell the raid gear would look like.<br />
Hopefully they traded good looking models for a larger amount of unique looking ones, you know, instead of just a bunch of recolored items.</div></div><hr />

I think the designs looks unique and interesting, always some guy having to spout off on how stupid they look.<br />
Id like to see you do a better job.</div></div><hr />

I almost thought these were cool PSO-style melee weapons(or Fist of Deity from Moorabi) then saw the &quot;crossbow&quot; label :(</div></div><hr />

Not sure how it will look carrying it around, but they are beautiful. as long as the raid isn't too easy and everyone has one, or in a different color, trivializing its uniqueness I'll say blizz did a great job here. I don't know how well the different colors will complement each other when the items are worn... we'll probably all look like a bag of skittles.<br />
<br />
I think these are the best, maybe someone should make a poll :)<br />
<br />
love this shape<br />

I'm really excited about the elemental weapons, I imagine something from skywall will have a transparent, hollow, ethereal look, and of course firelands will have flaming, exploding weapons at least I hope they express the elemental feel... maybe some artists here could draw some model suggestions and post, we vote on them.</div></div><hr />

I'd love to play the game you're playing where I could actually believe that would happen.</div></div><hr />

I agree...ideally I'd love to have different colors for the same weapon. though I suppose if its the same weapon, say blue axe is 6 item levels higher than green axe and blue gives +20 more strength than green axe, thats fine. same weapon characteristics though better stats with colors. thats okay. having a weapon from heroic hard mode sharing the same skin as 10 man raid should not happen. IMO, the weapon models should be distinguishable and unique<br />
<br />
Edit: If blizzard really wanted to show they loved us, they would give awesome looking weapons like these without detracting from uniqueness and originality by recycling models from top end raids (I know its hard to keep coming up with original weapon designs) and allow us to visit a vendor to change the color by trading the weapon for another weapon of the same exact type in our favorite color. blue, green, purple weapons all being the same so we dont look like a bag of skittles with rainbow gear, but we can match gear according to a color theme if we wanted.</div></div><hr />
