PvP Mounts - Twilight Drake PvP Mounts<br />
Gladiators get a brand new mount next season! As far as datamining goes the color of the new Vicious Gladiator's Twilight Drake (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/101282/vicious-gladiators-twilight-drake/) seems to be that one (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2011/may/viciousgladiatortwilightdrake.jpg). <br />

&lt;/tr&gt;<br />
&lt;/table&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
PvP Mounts - Epic Wolf and Horse PvP Mounts<br />
Two new awesome PvP mounts have been added, the Horde War Wolf (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/70910/horde-war-wolf/) and the Alliance War Steed (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/70909/alliance-war-steed/) are rewards of the Veteran of the Horde II (http://db.mmo-champion.com/a/5824/veteran-of-the-horde-ii/) and Veteran of the Alliance II (http://db.mmo-champion.com/a/5823/veteran-of-the-alliance-ii/) achievements. There's also a couple of recolors but as far as I know only the first 2 pictures below are used. <br />

<br />
<br />
PvE Mounts - Fire Hawks<br />
3 different Fire Hawks are currently in the game files but only 2 seem to be implemented/have a known drop location.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Corrupted Fire Hawk (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/97560/corrupted-fire-hawk/) (Purple) is used by Corrupted Egg of Millagazor (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/69230/corrupted-egg-of-millagazor/), a reward of Glory of the Firelands Raider (http://db.mmo-champion.com/a/5828/glory-of-the-firelands-raider/)<br />
Pureblood Fire Hawk (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/97493/pureblood-fire-hawk/) (Orange) is used by Smoldering Egg of Millagazor (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/69224/smoldering-egg-of-millagazor/), a rare drop from Ragnaros in the Firelands Raid. (Doesn't seem to be heroic-only so far) <br />
Green Fire Hawk (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/97501/green-fire-hawk/) (Green) is used by Green Fire Hawk Mount (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/69226/green-fire-hawk-mount/) but doesn't seem to be implemented.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
PvE Mount - Fire &quot;Raven God&quot; / Flametalon of Alysrazor<br />
The Fire &quot;Raven God&quot; model is the Flametalon (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/101542/flametalon/) mount from Flametalon of Alysrazor (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/71665/flametalon-of-alysrazor/). The mount isn't listed as a loot from Alysrazor in the Encounter Journal for the moment but it's very likely that it will drop from this boss, let's just wait and see if there's an official confirmation in an upcoming PTR build.<br />

<br />
<br />
PvE Mount - Flameward Hippogryph<br />
The Flameward Hippogryph (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/69213/flameward-hippogryph/) is a reward of the The Molten Front Offensive (http://db.mmo-champion.com/a/5866/the-molten-front-offensive/), you can get this achievement by completing all the questlines of the new Firelands daily quests area. <br />

As far as I'm aware you can only use ground mounts in BG's Arenas? so yeah why wouldn't you get a mount you can use in those places as a reward from doing those places ..</div></div><hr />

<br />
you don't seem to grasp the difference between models and skins.<br />
skeleton= the basic frame works of a moving digital object.<br />
models= the visual item that goes over the skeleton.<br />
skin= the visual texture of the model.<br />
palette= the hues of the skin and portions of the skin.<br />
<br />
what your asking for isn't a new model, cause we got alot of those recently actually.<br />
your asking for a new skeleton and animation pack, something that takes a considerable amount of time to get to the polished point we see for them in WoW.</div></div><hr />

actually I know you were trying to be sarcastic but vivendi games agress with you<br />

<br />
yes, they are very time consuming to make and make a whole range of animations for, then polish them, then fit the model onto it, check the clipping of the model when doing tha animations, then add the skin/pallet, etc.<br />
making a good model take alot of going back again and again and again and again and again....</div></div><hr />

everyone pays the same so they should have access to the same content, companions and mounts because if they do not then there is a chance that they will cancel their subscription<br />
<br />
Last time I checked, this is all content that is available to everyone. The issue is how much effort are you willing to put in, and that is not an availability issue, it's a personal choice of time dedication. How much time do you want to invest in becoming a good player, minmaxing your character and forming a welloiled machine with others of this mindset to achieve the things that don't just drop out of the Furbolg's ass. <br />
<br />
The choice is yours to go for it or not. If you choose not to, well, you will not own the mount, simple :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
it takes a long time actually, to first open the the firelands, u need 5 days (4 tokens per day and need total of 20) then you have to help each faction which has ultimately 125 each? and there's 3 of them...but there are also more dailies so I'm not sure how much tokens you can get...since they are reframing this from the argent tournament, I say quite a while.

I'm pretty sure he was implying that Gladiators are getting shafted this season in comparison, and you're implying that hitting Gladiator ratings isn't equally as difficult (or much more difficult) as what would be the tasks of obtaining a &quot;raid mount&quot; and/or you're misunderstanding his statement in a different fashion.</div></div><hr />

Dude, Top arena players always just got mounts allrdy in the game with or without armor on (Nethwing drakes with armor) (Frostbrood without) Nothing changed. An players liked it so far, so whats the big diffrence now?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mmocc5c312fa0d</div><div class="date">2011-05-31, 08:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not impressed with any of these mounts, save for the wolves/horses because at least they're new models.<br />
<br />
IMO (In my opinion, so remember, my opinion, don't argue with it.):<br />
<br />
- Twilight Drakes look lazily made, they're just the original ones with some rubbish armour slapped on them.<br />
<br />
- I'll let the wolves/horses off because they have a nice, unique model but no doubt the wolves will still have that broken-leg run.<br />
<br />
- Fire Hawks... Well, I've never liked the Fire Hawks and I've never understood why everyone liked them either. Their wings look stiff when they fly, that proto-drake skeleton just does not work at all for them and... they just don't look like any kind of bird or phoenix. Not to mention they're far too bright for people with bad eyes like myself, I have to squint before looking at that orange one. <br />
<br />
- Flametalon of Alysrazor is a disgrace to my beautiful Anzu mount, it doesn't look detailed or even finished.<br />
<br />
- I will let the Flameward Hippogryph off because I like hippogryphs, even more so now they're making them land mounts as well. (At last.) <br />
<br />
Blizzard, when we said we were sick of drake mounts, we didn't mean we wanted other models and skeletons butchered to hell to make other 'special' new mounts!<br />
<br />
I can't wait for the next mount that comes out that has it's own model, skeleton and STAYS unique.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'd rather have them focus on raid encounters and actually making the game a challenge instead of silly vanity mounts. It's not like they're not suppose to be reskins anway...<br />

The PvP horde wolf is probably the best looking ground mount in the game. The horse, on the other hand, looks like a table.<br />
<br />
spectral tiger is better looking than that u ever seen a spectral tiger at night on wow they glow in the dark like mad, spectral tiger is an old mount but its still dman rare and one of the best looking</div></div><hr />

<br />
Its not our work to be creative, Blizz has to come it with the ideas. <br />
And when they finally come up with a new Model, you have to buy it in the pet shop.... For regular players there is just reskin over reskin....</div></div><hr />

As a collector with 134 mounts, aiming for 150 before they add the achievement, I'll be starting Rated Bgs for this. I've got no wins, but intend to change that and have it by the month's end. <br />
<br />
First time I've actually farmed a ground mount I wanted to use. Kudos Blizzard very nice ground mount.<br />
<br />
The Firehawks are pretty awesome. Shame they used the Proto-Drake skeleton, though. Glad they didn't use the skeleton from Al'ar, though. They should have used the Regular Drake skeleton but when idle on the ground, have the &quot;Sit&quot; animation instead of on all 4s. The Slate Dragons in Stonecore show the &quot;Sit&quot; idle animation if you don't know it.<br />
<br />
The Alliance PvP mount just makes me laugh XD Glad I'm Horde.<br />
<br />
The Gladiator Mount... Literally uses the same exact skin for the Dragon itself. The armor is simply slapped on. People complaining about the model have a right to. They didn't even change the dragons skin. Just recolored it. I Don't get it because they've never re-used a skin for a mount that already existed. Even the Black Drake, Twilight Drake, Red Drake, and Bronze Drake used updated skin counts for the mounts. The fact that a Gladiator mount didn't shows they care less about it then the Bronze Drake. I'd be pretty pissed on that lazyness.<br />
<br />
The armor on the drakes aren't bad. But they don't fit the dragon at all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I even could do some sketches in my spare time, so i am not completely talking out of my butt here, but a spidermount would be awesome. Fire spider would even fit into the 4.2 raid, if nowhere else. (Hell..there could be a spider riding trainer in any troll/spider area like Zin Alor for Horde or for Alliance in Duskwood.<br />
<br />
Bat windriders are in place..so a bat mount (Brill?) would be easy, I suppose.<br />
<br />
Rocket pack (Gunship anyone) or boots.<br />
<br />
Cloud serpents (even that is in game)<br />
<br />
So, yeah...those are ingame models - which most people probably wouldn't even mind, because they still bring something new to the mount collection..and not another drake.</div></div><hr />

<br />
so what´s the difference between this drake and any other gladiator drake? there wasn´t a single unique one between them they´ve just put armor on already existing drakes which matched the current theme(nether,frostbrood...).<br />
do you complain because it´s cool to complain about reskins nowadays or can you tell me the difference?(rhetorical question, there is none)</div></div><hr />

I wonder how the PVE monkeys would like to get the same exact mount every raid tier with a different color. I wonder how they would like every tier gear to be the exact same with a slightly different color and a few spikes put onto the gear. You monkey retards would be bitching up a storm.

If you have a look at the arena nether drakes from Arena Seasons 1 to 4 (Burning Crusade xpac) they are just normal nether drakes with armour put on them. And as far as I know no one complained back then about having reskinned nether drakes as the rewards for being good in arena.<br />

But oh no they reskinned nether drakes and added stuff to them. Oh the humanity how could blizz do this to us back then. Get a grip the new mounts are fine and yes they using a LK drake model with added armour to them but it has been done before and will be done again.</div></div><hr />

With three models, you'd think they could have made at least one available somewhere in the Firelands daily hub. Is it so hard to put the green one (crappiest color of the three by far) on a vendor that is only available after you've unlocked the whole zone, for 5k gold?<br />
<br />
I'd have less of a problem with the Firehawks if they weren't one of the only two phoenix models available in game. Every other new flying mount (with very few exceptions) is either a reskin or a drake... or a reskinned drake. Just look at the launch mounts: Stone drakes used the model of normal drakes, Storm drakes are based off the nether drakes...<br />
<br />
It would be nice if there were more mythical creatures to fly in than just dragons. Then they give us Firehawks. &quot;Oh hey cool, three new phoenixes! And they use the proto drake skeleton, awesome choice, I love proto drakes! I wonder if I can get one maybe... Well there's three, One as a rare drop, one as a Glory of the Firelands, that leaves one available for non-raiders!....&quot;<br />
*Reads this news post*<br />
<br />
<br />
Seriously, stuff like this makes me lose faith in blizz. If I had to guess though, I'd say the green one will be for &quot;Guild Glory of the Firelands raider&quot; Which at least I can get if I join a decent guild and grind rep. Which means leaving my guild if I want so much as a shot at these mounts. It makes me hate the game when casuals get yet another reskinned hyppogrif (Because its not like that wasn't the major flying mount reward from the Argent Tournament or anything) but in adding THREE phoenixes to the game, they couldn't even toss the casuals one. If nearly 400 daily quests isn't enough for a casual to earn a phoenix, what the hell is? What do casual players need to do to get a bone here? <br />
<br />
They did it right with storm drakes: Two from raids, Two not from raids. Two rare drops, two rewards. If the third phoenix isn't reasonably obtainable, I'm going to be very disappointed with blizz.<br />
<br />
And before the &quot;elite pro's&quot; roll in here with their talk of how &quot;everything should be handed to you&quot; No. I don't want my mount handed to me. If it means doing a whopping 700 daily quests, I'd do it for that mount. But that's not the issue, is it? You don't care if the casual works for it, you only care that they didn't raid to get it, which is asinine.</div></div><hr />

making a good model take alot of going back again and again and again and again and again....To start from complete scratch, yes. However, they don't have to -- even adding a few unique animations to each new mount would do a lot to add more personality and coolness. <br />
<br />
More time and effort? Yes. But hardly unreasonable. <br />
<br />
Often it's the animations of a model that really give it personality, since in actual gameplay you rarely have time for a careful inspection of the model.</div></div><hr />

Aaannd .... you need mounts to be a special/unique/awesome individual amirite? Because your $15 a month doesn't get you Raids/PvP/Achievements/Titles/Gear/World firsts/server firsts. The way these greedy raiders act they should rename WoW too &quot;World of Mountcraft&quot; considering its the real reason raiders actually waste time in raids anymore.

<br />
Like 1 billion dollars of revenue a year of work ? These guys are supposedly professionals and high school kids in their basement with moderate knowledge of 3DMax / Maya can create from scratch 10x better models (which are optimized, clean, and unique) over a long weekend. Adding a horn to a dragon doesn't take a long time. Its a 20 poly model tacked on to an existing model and some cleanup down to make it look &quot;clean&quot; (which they rarely do very well as it is). Throw on a texture (which is also to be recycled on 5 blues, a few epics, and an entire Tier's worth of armor) and you've got your typical &quot;new&quot; mount.<br />
<br />
The &quot;its a lot of work&quot; argument simply doesn't work. In addition to the sub, the $40 expansion pack fee is supposed to be for &quot;new&quot; content, not bullshit like Icecrown Citadel (ie: Black Temple with skulls thrown on everything, missing any variety or decor).<br />
<br />
/sigh</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ryuxlol</div><div class="date">2011-06-03, 03:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yep. When kids are producing better models than you are it's time to reevaluate the quality of your output as a game designer.<br />
<br />
Given the position they are in they really have no excuse for producing crappy models. Furthermore, model design is not a subject which you can attempt to mystify and claim that it costs a ton of money. There are people in the community who have taken a multimedia course, there are people who have modded games and there are people who do 3D artwork professionally themselves, so we know what the effort involved is.<br />
<br />
These gladiator mounts are essentially armor added to an existing model, so we're looking at how long it would take a 3D designer to design that armor. 1 week, 2 at most.<br />
<br />
$90 an hour, 8 hrs a week, five days in a week, 2 weeks. 90 x 8 x 10 = U$7200 to produce those glad mounts and that's probably being generous. There just aren't enough variables involved for that estimate to not be pretty accurate.<br />
<br />
Subscriptions of only the amount of people that will earn that mount, not including the people for whom that mount is an aspiration, already FAR outstrips the minimal effort involved in creating it. There's not really any excuse for it and it's production of shoddy work like this which is why WoW is down 600k subscribers, they simply weren't willing to pay for the gaming equivalent of being fed scraps.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'd rather have a scorpion than yet another pussycat.<br />
I think both horde and alliance have nice mounts, but the sheer number of each type makes us long for the ones at the other side.<br />
<br />
new Mounts that come into mind straight away:<br />
<br />
4 wheeled buggy<br />
Monocycle (or how do you call it?)<br />
Hydra like ground mount<br />
Bull<br />
Jormungar<br />
Spider<br />
Corehound<br />
Large snake<br />
Plane flying mount<br />
Squid water mount<br />
<br />
Everything except horses, tigers/lions, raptors, bears and flying dragons<br />

Being too bad to raid would mean that you are in a comatized state of vegetableness.<br />
Anything better than that means that you can clear any pve-content tbh.<br />
<br />
<br />
Update: For the glory drake you need to do the heroic versions of the bosses and achievements, which only a few percent of the player base managed to do so far. <br />
only a few people managed to get 13/13 HC, which I suppose is your idea of 'any pve content'. (or not?)<br />
So following that logic, that would mean that the majority (dare I give a percentage of 95+ at the risk of people flaming me for pullling random numbers out of my ass? Yes I do!!) of the players are vegetables.<br />
<br />
I very disagree with you.</div></div><hr />
