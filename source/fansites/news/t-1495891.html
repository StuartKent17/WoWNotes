Warlords of Draenor - Garrisons<br />
Warlords of Draenor is adding Garrisons, which are WoW's version of Player Housing. Rather than decorating a house, you are able to build and upgrade a base, as well as collecting followers. Blizzard has previously shown off some Garrison artwork (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3753-Artcraft-Building-a-Garrison), as well as sharing some information at Blizzcon during the World of Warcraft: What's Next panel (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3523-World-of-Warcraft-What-s-Next) and the World of Warcraft Raids, Gameplay, Questing, and More panel (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3540-World-of-Warcraft-Raids-Gameplay-Questing-and-More).<br />

<br />
Garrison Levels<br />
Right now there are two different locations with plots in the files, one of which doesn't include the fishing hut.<br />
<br />
Level 1 - 2 Small Plots, 1 Medium Plot, 1 Large Plot, Mine, Farm, and Fishing Hut<br />
Level 2 - 3 Small Plots, 2 Medium Plots, 2 Large Plots, Mine, Farm, and Fishing Hut<br />
Level 3 - 4 Small Plots, 3 Medium Plots, 3 Large Plots, Mine, Farm, and Fishing Hut<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Buildings<br />
A garrison is made up of plots, which are filled by buildings.<br />
<br />
<br />
You can't have every building at once, as you are limited by the number of plots. <br />
Each building has a base level and two possible upgrades.<br />
There are buildings for almost every profession, which allow you to gather reagents daily and make some of that profession's items. <br />
The base level profession building only can hold one day's worth of reagents, so you have to collect them every day. As you upgrade, the building can hold two and then four days worth of reagent batches. <br />
Each building has specializations, which gives you some kind of perk, such as portals, more reagents, or buffs to followers.<br />
Each building sits on a different plot size, with Profession buildings requiring small plots. The Mine, Fishing Hut, Farm, and Pet Menagerie are listed as unique plot types.<br />

PvE<br />
Any indication of what a mythic roster looks like, role-wise? An inkling would sure help me go from 10-man to mythic.<br />
2-3 tanks (mostly 2), 4-6 healers (mostly 5), ~13 DPS. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/447399563318398976))<br />
<br />
I'd say that an unwritten law is that if an encounter is designed for X healers, top guilds will X-1 heal at least<br />
It may be nearly unavoidable at the very cutting edge. It's a problem when people are still underhealing months later. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/445578299587043328))<br />
When you're undergeared the first weeks, better to wipe 90% of the time to lacking heals than 100% of the time to lacking DPS (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/445578450372268033))<br />
<br />
Do you consider the fact that most raids 'reset' Dark Shamans so they spawn outside the room a design mistake?<br />
Not ideal; was a band-aid late in the PTR cycle for the fact that pulling them out to begin the pull was awkward. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/446013373436534784))<br />
<br />
WHY do you enable cross realm on heroic mode when there are still realm first on the table??<br />
Realm Firsts aren't removed by this. You still need a guild group to achieve a realm first. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/446017700943241216))<br />
But 3 people can get to our server and help kill garrosh and the guild get the realm first?<br />
Yes, you could have 3 xrealm people help your 25man group kill Garrosh. That's still 22 players from the guild; they earn it. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/446018494811742208))<br />
In my opinion that's not fair at all I have been fighting to get to the top guild... to some random people come and take it away<br />
But that's the point; it wouldn't be some random people coming to take it away. They can't do that. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/446019596890279936))<br />
Some people (and we have proff) are selling us the kill of garrosh with our accounts. Ofcourse we didn't accept it...<br />
That's totally against our ToS, and we are staunchly against that. And, it's completely unrelated to this change. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/446020821752893440))<br />
For a ToS clarification, what sort of kill/achievement sales go against it? (Obviously playing other accounts would).<br />
I believe can answer that. I was just immediately responding to the &quot;playing others' accounts&quot; part, which is obvious (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/446041078970327041))<br />
<br />
Any eta on when heroic/normal no longer shares a lockout. AKA can we do both a normal and a heroic run in the same week?<br />
The pre-Warlords patch 6.0. That's a much more fundamental change to how raids are structured. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/446073091655888896))<br />
<br />
Also, what would it do if the printed to file combat log saw EVERYTHING. Including things in other phases (like Norushen).<br />
Working on getting the combat log to do exactly that - couple of issues to sort out but nothing insurmountable. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/446870706786033664))<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
did you ever test 4v4 arena games? I feel 5v5 is too much of a zerg fest, curious about how 4v4 would feel...<br />
2 healers 2 dps is not fun (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/446100497255002112))<br />
I was thinking of it as a 2heals+2dps and 1heal+3dps mix, kinda like 2s with heal+dps and double dps...<br />
We could always enforce role compositions but that feels very heavy handed. Better when a meta emerges. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/446125002090221568))<br />
<br />
Any plans on allowing Vicious Skeletal Warhorse (and other Vicious Saddle mounts) account-wide ?<br />
Nope. They are character bound to encourage repeat accomplishment. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/446210597458169856))<br />
<br />
do you think removing 2v2 could improve pool and focus of arenas more?<br />
tricky question. I think it would improve 3v3 participation but reduce arena participation overall. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/446477201349681152))<br />
<br />
Any chance to make cross-spec gearing for Hybrids easier? Currently you're stuck with one spec until the near end of season.<br />
In warlords, the primary stat on gear changes based in your spec. Lots of info out there about it. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/446683865969463296))<br />

Heartbleed Account Security Notice<br />
Many news sites are reporting a vulnerability (dubbed the Heartbleed bug) discovered in OpenSSL, an encryption technology used by a majority of websites and online services—including banks, email providers, and social media sites—to protect sensitive data as it’s transmitted from users to web services.<br />
<br />
We want to emphasize that Battle.net’s encryption was not affected by this vulnerability. However, if you use the same password on Battle.net that you use elsewhere, your Battle.net account could be at risk if those sites were affected by this bug.<br />
If the above situation applies to you, we recommend changing your Battle.net password to a new, unique password. As always, we recommend that you maintain separate login credentials for each online service you use. Using the same email or password across multiple services greatly increases the potential impact of any compromise.<br />

Nah, they are given more squat and wide and beefy features in HOTS. Like Warhammer minis sort of. Even Tyrande looks unusually voluptuous here. <br />
But look at the humans. As much as I'd love this level of over the top in WOW, people hate me and my thing for silly cartoony over the top rusty chipped chunky models :D<br />

Well, they've always been used at events like this, just not used as community demos which burns out half the game's subs as the new and shiny wears off not long after release because they've seen it all and spent a lot of time in the places we're spending time in. <br />

<br />
And how do you make sure that the people chosen will actually test the beta?<br />
<br />
By handing out betas to a large number of people. By giving it to a small few people, you aren't magically insuring that those few will actually test.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The absolute definition of special snowflake syndrome right here, 200-300 people wouldn't be testing everything, there is no way 300 people would be able to fully test a game on the scale of WoW. Raid testing wouldn't happen meaningfully as there is no telling if 10 of the 200-300 people would be skilled raiders and even then they might not be compatible in a group then no raid testing would get done.</div></div><hr />

I think our special snowflake there equates '200-300' to mean &quot;take only the top 10 guilds and then round out the rest with the top in PvP&quot; of course you run into the same problem you mention, where the top raiders and PvP'ers won't necessarily be the best at testing and finding bugs, as they will concentrate on the end game stuff, and not exploration.</div></div><hr />

There, I fixed that for you. <br />
<br />
But seriously, I am scared of how cool yet limited one character's garrison will be. I am a HUGE altoholic, and to think I spend over an hour just on the farm for all my toons each day harvesting ore and cloth and motes, I DREAD how much of a time sink garrisons will be across multiple toons.<br />
<br />
Meh big girl little girl, what does that matter? I AM a girl, so excuse ME for acting like one when I get features that I would more than likely enjoy ;P<br />
<br />
And you don't have to do it on all your alts, but I can see why people would want to. Guess it depends how much you need / want the stuff in there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The problem with top players is that many pay for their rating and others even legit players post biased nerf demands to improve their position.<br />
There are of course respectable top players with valid posts and interest in a balanced game but i found them to be rather scarce in the group who posts.<br />

The kids in here bitching about not being able to 'play' beta are exactly the ones you don't want in, self-serving brats who won't actually do any testing. grats to the PAX attenders, they actually deserve it<br />

yeah they totally deserve the ebay money, cause lets be real 200-300 $ &gt; playing some beta. It's just gonna serve as covering the pax visit costs + some extra profit.<br />

It is not player housing, that is correct, but it is the next best thing to player housing. Blizzard has said several times that they are experimenting with this type of thing and that Garrisons, along with future content similar to Garrisons, aren't considered as housing, but as a step towards player housing in WoW.<br />
<br />
It was scrapped in vanilla, and now Blizzard wants to develop a better version of player housing than what the norm for it is in most MMOs.</div></div><hr />

I can agree with this. I have never played Star Trek, but I have played other games with ´follower mission´ type gameplay and it is addicting as hell. None of them had 7-day raid missions and stuff like that though... in most of them, the longest missions take 18 hours or so. It will be cool to have an army in a garrison and have them all going out on different missions and then getting reports of how they did.<br />
<br />
People who say they hate the idea now will be begging for an app to get their reports next year at this time.<br />

<br />
Don't suppose you have a link to that? I don't recall hearing anything definitive, and the more I read about garrisons the more I get the impression that they will be required.<br />
<br />
I think they are going to be very integrated with your questing and leveling. But I think it is IMPOSSIBLE that they will be required for raiding or give any benefit to raiders... but then again, people cried that dailies were required to raid despite the fact that most people had raids cleared before they could even buy a single piece of gear with valor.<br />
<br />
OMG.. you can get herbs from your garrison, I need herbs to make potions when I raid.. therefore ´garrisons are mandatory to raid´.. that type of crap will happen, just like it did with every expansion before it. The fake hardcore raiders will cry about ANY aspect of the game that isn´t raiding and find some weak reason to complain about it. Meanwhile, the real raiders will be killing bosses without even touching garrisons.<br />
<br />
But in the end, Raiding is a PART of this game, you can´t just cry about every other part of the game if it happens to impact raiding.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I had to chuckle at this because I'm a very casual player. For years I've had to listen to people bash &quot;bads&quot; and &quot;casuals&quot; because they want &quot;welfare epics&quot; and gear upgrades when they don't have time to raid, etc. So to see someone say they want all followers at once and a big farm and professions buildings without having to spend more than a few minutes a day is amusing. It should either be worth the effort or not, and if it isn't worth it to you then don't do it and spend your time on things that are. Most of us don't have unlimited play time. Don't say you don't want to invest any time, but you want all the benefits.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, now THIS has me excited. As i am a huge mount person with 130+ mounts (Not a lot but quite a few are rare) i am extremely stoked for this. I really want to hear more about this as it is bugging me.<br />
<br />
HOWEVER, i have one issue. I am one of those people pretty bad at making gold. Are these prices just placeholders or are we looking at spending THIS much gold just to have a garrison. If so then it will be definitely out of my gold budget and also make me disappointed. Hopefully, blizzard will make it some sort of WoD currency to buy the buildings/upgrades for them. I'd much prefer something like that. 10k Gold is just too damn much to upgrade/buy something/<br />
<br />
So far things are looking great just the garrison prices are bothering me a bit but hopefully their just placeholders.</div></div><hr />

<br />
LOL, what??? did you play 1 week of MOP only?<br />
<br />
How about Timeless island gear? How about the legendary cloak giving your alts access to Ordos? How about warbands dropping rep tokens? How about the massive amount of BOE blue drops with crazy high ilvls. My freakin warrior STARTED questing in Jade Forest duel-wielding 463 weapons and had an ilvl over 420 STARTING at lvl 85 all from my main. How is that not alt-friendly?<br />
<br />
It is like 5.0 all over again. People who were too stupid to be efficient and too stupid to do some basic math and realize that there was no need to grind reputations because you didn´t have enough VP to buy anything anyway. Now you have stupid comments about ´not alt friendly´ because what? my alt tailor had to wait a few months to make a bag? yes yes.. the entire expansion was alt unfriendly because I wasn´t able to make the new bag pattern on the second day of the expansion.<br />
<br />
I mean seriously, you want to have all your reps and gear just be completely shared with all 11 of your alts?</div></div><hr />

Wrong. MoP HAS been alt unfriendly, and 5.4 IS alt friendly because of this. That is fact.</div></div><hr />

The entirety of MoP has been very unfriendly for alts. <br />
The fact that I NEED a cloak on my alts to do anything beyond Normal modes is a total load of garbage, imo. <br />
I have the cloak/meta on my 14/14H 578 main and my 565 alt but, I also have a few alts using my Heroic BoA weapons and they're in the 540s-550s range and without a cloak their damage/healing suffers. It's pretty taxing and irritating to think I have to spend even more months wasting my time in old LFR content to get the items needed for another cloak. <br />
<br />
I don't care about rep and I rarely visit the timeless isle on any toons (beyond opening chests once per week and bosses) so what is there really left to offer my alts besides wasting my time on the cloak quest.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mellrod</div><div class="date">2014-04-13, 03:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">^^ this will be the tillers in bigger format and yes you needed dailies for that to unlock the bigger soils, for the cooking and for the fishing.<br />
This will be the exact same thing for all professions that will come in this.<br />
<br />
They announced at Blizzcon that endgame content wouldn't have any dailies. You can get Garrisons early on but the features make it lean more towards endgame content. So no, there shouldn't be any dailies in Garrisons. Idk where you're complaints are coming from. If there are garrison dailies, i'm sure it'll be datamined even though that seems like something that would've already been mined.<br />
<br />
Anyways, i think a really cool feature about this was something that was discussed in an interview on Wowhead (http://www.wowhead.com/news=234257/warlords-of-draenor-wowhead-interviews-blizzard-developers). They mentioned it in the brief summary:<br />
<br />
<br />
your Garrison can be attacked by NPCs, and you get rewards for defending it. I know people were asking for something like that with PvP (sounds like it'd bring up alot of problems imo) but i think NPCs are the next best thing to that. Sounds pretty cool to defend your base.<br />
<br />
I just wonder if you get loot from the NPCs, and since Garrisons have offline progression, then i would be kinda worried about my Garrison getting attacked while im offline.<br />

That's not true. Not sure where you heard the cloak being a requirement for normal modes from. Only thing the cloak gets you access to is a world boss on the timeless isle (which you rarely visit to begin with). The entirety of MoP has been alt friendly. Everything from the Tiller's farm to Battlefield: Barrens and Timeless Isle. Not only with gearing and proffessions, but there are tons of items to help your reputation on alts. Alot of your complaints seem to be issues specific to you and not anyone else since it is easy to get geared up for SoO just by Timeless Isle and LFR alone. I've done so on my hunter. MoP is alt-friendly in alot of aspects.</div></div><hr />

the second they yield DPS increases...it becomes mandatory. perks good, forcing us to do it bad.<br />

<br />
I'm sorry but managing minion is not fun specially not in this manner. Every game that had minion managing is a fire and forget till you get loots and is boring. If I wanted to manage stuff I'd play sim city or the likes. And its not like pet battles; pet battles are crappy but not mandatory. Garrison will be mandatory because the whole expansion is about it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vaelkder</div><div class="date">2014-04-13, 06:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Got my beta key at PAX! There were a number of booths that rewarded people for waiting in line after playing their games with beta keys, swag and other cool stuff. Personally the beta key takes the top spot since I didn't expect it all after waiting for an hour or so to play Warlords of Draenor.<br />
<br />
Am I allowed to say that I'm jealous without being flamed? :cool:<br />
<br />
Seriously, I do have to wonder about some of the decisions of Blizzard. I purchased two BlizzCon tickets, as well as the additional Forum Passes, to send my grandson and his best friend there for the chance of having lifelong memories, while I purchased the BlizzCon Online Pass for myself (no chance of spilled popcorn! lol). I couldn't make it to PAX, due to time constraints (having a real-world life can be a nuisance at times), and I see that the PAX-goers are receiving Warlords of Draenor Beta Passes, where the people who payed the silly amounts of money to attend BlizzCon and ALL of the forums, as well as purchasing the Online Passes to watch from the comfort of home, receive not one thought from Blizzard, regarding the possibility of thanking all of those faithful Blizzard fans with a Beta Pass.<br />
<br />
Oh, well, I suppose this was to be expected. I'll be hoping that I might receive an invitation to Beta Test WoD via my opt-in request on my Account Page.<br />
<br />
Good luck to everyone in receiving a Beta invitation, and congratulations and HAVE FUN to those people at PAX who are going to be testing out the new content! :D</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aerofluff</div><div class="date">2014-04-13, 10:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I like the concept of garrisons, but my problem is that I don't play an orc and don't want to have to look at primitive orcish buildings all the time when I'm in my base spending time upgrading stuff. It's not going to feel appropriate or thematic to my character, but I just know Blizzard's too lazy to implement racial building appearances. (Or if they did, people would complain that it's not needed or too much time has been wasted. &gt;.&gt; )<br />
<br />
So I'm less enthused about it than I would be otherwise, because it's just going to be a bunch of crappy orc huts. :\ <br />
It would be so much more engaging and unique if it were based off of race... a Forsaken's garrison looking like Brill / Tarren Mill, Crossroads-style painted-leather teepees and such for Tauren, white Belf towers, etc. So much flavor could be had. But we all know that's not happening. &lt;/3</div></div><hr />

The floor didn't open until 10 am. I was in the second queue line to get in (out of 8 or so). The first place I went was to the Blizzard line and the line for WoD was already 2 hours long. Said &quot;Fuck it&quot; and peaced out. Closed beta access wasn't worth standing in line for 2 hours when there was a slew of other shit to do. Especially when I've become even less impressed with what I've seen of the garrison feature. I went and checked out a lot of the indie games instead.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I went through the line with a friend of mine on Sunday morning, and it took approximately 2 and a half hours. Thankfully we had already been through the gamut of PAX on Friday and Saturday, but it was still a killer to stand waiting on concrete for that long. My feet still hate me.</div></div><hr />
