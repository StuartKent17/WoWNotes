It seems that you just get the sword from an event in the dungeon, started by a guy from the Silver Hand. After that, you handle the item to a guy in Valgarde and realize that the Cleric of the Silver Hand was Tirion Fordring, he gets the sword and laugh while the retribution paladin of your party keep crying.

Dialogue after you handle the sword : (Source (http://www.cydel.net/cadia/forums/viewtopic.php?t=7049))<br />
A nearby cloaked Cleric walks over and reveals himself as Tirion Fordring. (model changes from the cleric to Tirion). Lord Irulon Trueblade says something about how Tirion shouldn't have revealed himself, Tirion waves him off. Dont have the exact dialogue for that, but right after it continues into this:<br />
<br />
Highlord Tirion Fordring says: Their passing wieghs heavily upon my soul.<br />
Lord Irulon Trueblade says: The path of freeedom has always been beset with tragedy sire. We could not risk losing you. The Order could not have survived such a blow.<br />
Highlord Tirion Fordring says: It should have been me that carried the blade. The burden was mine to bare.<br />
Highlord Tirion Fordring says: But you are right, Irulon. The price of our freedom will undoubtedly cost thousands more of their lives.<br />
Highlord Tirion Fordring yells: Do you hear me Arthas? The Silver Hand comes for you! Your kingdom shall crumble beneath the weight of justice! By the light!</div></div><hr />

But, finding a &quot;Sacred Artifact&quot; in a Vykrul dungeon that just so happens to be the lengendary Ashbringer? <br />
<br />
Come on &gt;_&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
The artifact itself isn't the Ashbringer. If you go into CoT: Durnholde and watch the Scarlet Crusade NPCs in the Southshore Inn interact, you'll learn the Ashbringer was crafted from an artifact Mograine recovered from a slain Horde warlock, an artifact. The artifact teemed with unholy powers, so much so that it wither Mograine's hand when he first tries to touch it. Mograine theorizes that such an artifact has an antithetical counterpart that could be used to fight the Scourge, as he believes that Light and Shadow exist in harmony and cannot exist without each other. Issilien dismisses Mograine's theory and tries to destroy the artifact with a blast of holy energy, but it instead absorbs the attack and becomes purified by the Light. <br />
<br />
From reading the flavortext of the quest, it sounds like the Silver Hand had wrested another such artifact from the Scourge deep in the heart of Naxxramas and purified it for the sake of recreating the blade (Inquisitor Fairbanks confirms the original cannot be cleansed as its corruption is too deep). It also sounds like the Vykrul have retaken the artifact for the Lich King and is perhaps on a timer because they intend on re-tainting the artifact.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Green<br />
Blue<br />
Purple (Epic)<br />
Orange (Legendary)<br />
Red (Artifact)<br />
<br />
Might be nothing, or could highlight the significance of the weapon.<br />
<br />
Also.. Don't Blizzard equip mobs with weapons available to players? Afaik they benefit from the stats also. Have read numerous lengthy debates about the effects stat reduction debuffs have on Game Mobs and that led to the base stat v equip stat question etc etc.</div></div><hr />

Or Irulon Trueblade forges the Ashbringer from the artifact and charges you to personally deliver it to Mograine. We've had countless quests before where we turn in items for NPCs to craft into another quest item for us to Fed-Ex it back to yet another quest NPC. This shouldn't really be any different....<br />
<br />
Members of the Scarlet Crusade revere the Ashbringer as the only hope against the Scourge and many have lost their lives in vain seeking out the original. Trueblade most likely is framing the importance if the sword in this context.</div></div><hr />

I would agree with this theory. There's a good chance that, despite the model used, that blade is not the Ashbringer at all, but a blade crafted with similar properties.<br />
<br />
Just as Frostmourne was the first and foremost of the vampiric runeblades wielded by the Lich King and his Death Knights, the Ashbringer was the first and foremost Holy Sword crafted by the Knights of the Silver Hand.

Do a WowWiki search for Highlord Mograine and/or the Ashbringer. It's just as helpful. :)<br />
<br />
SS's are hard to come by because you need to be wielding a Corrupted Ashbringer (a low-drop-rate requiring Mograine to die last when fighting the 4 Horsemen) inside the Scarlet Monastary. When you do so, you autimatically become hated with Argent Dawn and Friendly with the Scarlet Crusade and you'll actually be able to speak to Scarlet Commander Mograine. A kick-ass scripted event ensues. ;D<br />
<br />
Once the event is over, you speak w/ Inquisitor Fairbanks about the possibility of purifying the sword, to which he states that it is beyond cleansing. The original Ashbringer was imbued with a part of Highlord Mograine's own soul. When he was betrayed and murdered by his own son, his soul became twisted with anger and vengeance, thus wholly corrupting the blade itself. This is also why the wielder of a Corrupted Ashbringer will also occasionally hear a whispering voice emanating from it while it's equipped.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tyrsenus</div><div class="date">2007-08-10, 04:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;Wrested an artifact from a fallen warrior of the Light. Our forces descended from the dread heart of Naxxramas. So many perished in the wake of its redemption.&quot;<br />
<br />
This most likely refers to the death knight Highlord Mograine, but that would mean they only obtained Corrupted Ashbringer. The &quot;it&quot; in &quot;its redemption&quot; is ambigious. It could be referring to the &quot;artifact&quot;-- Ashbringer, or Naxxramas itself. If it is Asbhringer, it sounds like they managed to redeem or purify it, but I don't understand why that would cause &quot;so many to perish in its wake.&quot;<br />
<br />
Corrupted Ashbringer can be looted from the Four Horsmen in Naxxramas. Taking it into the Scarlet Monastery Cathedral starts a scripted event. Highlord Mograine's ghost kills his son, and resurrects Inquisitor Fairbanks.<br />
<br />
Fairbanks: &quot;I'm afraid that the blade which you hold in your hands is beyond saving. The hatred runs too deep. But do not lose hope, warrior. Where one chapter has ended, a new one begins.<br />
Find his son - a more devout and pious man you may never meet. It is rumored that he is able to build the Ashbringer anew, without requiring the old, tainted blade.&quot;<br />
<br />
Fairbanks specifically tells the player that Corrupted Ashbringer cannot be purified or cleansed-- it can only be created again from scratch. The Northrend quest gives no indication that it has been reforged, therefore the Silver Hand cannot logically be in possession of &quot;pure&quot; Ashbringer. Either the Ashbringer story has been retconned or the designers made a mistake.</div></div><hr />

I had heard from other raiders that a kill order was required to make certain drops drop from 4-Horsemen as well and that Mograine needed to die last for Corrupted Ashbringer to drop. I unfortunately never made it anywhere near that far in Naxx to confirm it. If it's true that no kill order is necessary, then I appreciate you're clearing that up. :)</div></div><hr />

LoL, obviously this sword is a fake, cooked up by yours truly. I got carried away in lore and decided to cook it up for the fun of it. :P I'm beginning to believe more and more that Lord Fordring's blade is not the actual Ashbringer, but a holy sword of similar power that was crafted much in the same way as Ashbringer.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I don't know where you heard this idea of a kill order, but there is none for the 4HM. Maybe you're thinking of the bug trio in AQ40.<br />
<br />
<br />
I've heard that from a few sources too.<br />
<br />
I had heard from other raiders that a kill order was required to make certain drops drop from 4-Horsemen as well and that Mograine needed to die last for Corrupted Ashbringer to drop. I unfortunately never made it anywhere near that far in Naxx to confirm it. If it's true that no kill order is necessary, then I appreciate you're clearing that up. :)</div></div><hr />

I believe the intent now is to continue making dungeons hubs including multiple wings for different level (and sometimes different size) gropus. So look forward to Utgarde &amp; others being Citadel/Auchindoun/Coilfang/Tempest Keep-type affairs.</div></div><hr />

Why do you think SM was such a success? It was multi-winged and made up of multiple fast instances rather then one insanely long one (reason why no one does Mara or Uldaman much anymore)<br />
<br />
BC showed us that it works perfectly to have multi-winged instances, we can all go in for 30 minutes, clear an instance, and be done, not to mention they can seperate each sector with its own backstory and everything.<br />
<br />
I love the multi-instance system, and am extremely pleased they are continuing it into WotLK</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">glamor</div><div class="date">2007-08-10, 07:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">imo i think the Mara, DM, and Strat instances were far superior to those of the fully separate instanced wings. the fact that you could be done with a wing of DM or Mara and HS out was great or you could take your group and clear the other side thats the next level up or you could do the highest lvl section of the instance if you wanted but it was all segmented and fully optional as to if you wanted to do the rest of the wings or not. Strat was the same way but just 1 less wing. don't get me wrong i like that there aren't any more BRD style dungeons that are very linear and non optional bosses wings, but i def like the way the three instances mentioned above were designed.<br />
<br />
sorry for derailing topic.<br />
<br />
this is all hearsay til they open up beta or someone else gets actual proof. they did mention that ashbringer would be obtainable by players at one point didn't they?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Big instances are fun, but pugging an instance that large just.. it isn't fun, its not worth it to get halfway in and your healer's mother is calling him to dinner..<br />
<br />
For guild runs, those instances were a blast though =D</div></div><hr />

Don't know if this has been answered but npcs dont actually wear armor, its part of their model. And I believe the weapon isn't actually a weapon either but the display model of the weapon.</div></div><hr />

Foreshadowing for the fact that at the end of the quests he says he's gonna restore the order? Well, D'UH!<br />
<br />
As for the sword, it might be Ashbringer, it might not be, the sword having a different name doesn't mean it's not the same, Ashbringer was being carried by a former friend of Tirion, and it was his name too (not the the sword, but Morgraine as well), it is possible the that Blightrender is Ashbringer's new name, and the new nick-name of its wielder. Am I making sense here (All I want is to ruin all hope of warriors and pallies to weild it mwahahaha)</div></div><hr />

Warris and Pallys will be the ONLY ones able to wear it. look @ tboazzinoth, blizz knows what wepps are usefull for witch classes so they only give it to certain classes since most hunters havent l2p their freakin class jet and would roll on babyes like this just because its legendaryz (seen a few hunters with tf and it rly anoyed me, so thx blizz for preverting this shait)<br />

I'd like to request that any further speculation on Blightrender itself cease and desist. I have already openly admitted that Blightrender is a fake created by me, though it is still worth speculating whether or not the &quot;ashbringer&quot; sword wielded by Tirion Fordring in the SS is indeed the Ashbringer itself reforged anew or another sword of similar power and origins.</div></div><hr />

I dunno how..but I made it thru this post..heh.. <br />
I agree with Ashbringer being Warr/Pally(Alliance pally only, a true &quot;holy&quot; blade would want to ass rape a BELF Pally) only, but ultimately the weapon being NPC-only would be better for WoWLore IMHO~</div></div><hr />

but id rly rly liked to see/do the questline to clear the corrupted sword. i was camping in diremaul after killing nef klicking every elf there for about 10hours. <br />
