Patch 4.3.2 PTR Notes<br />
The first World of Warcraft: Cataclysm patch of the year is in development and now available for testing on the Public Test Realms. This minor patch includes several updates that we were unable to apply via hotfixes (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/208124-patch-43-hotfixes/), including the recently announced cross-realm raids (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/215520-coming-in-patch-432-cross-realm-raids/), assorted class balance fixes, and more. If you'd like to help us test out this patch and provide feedback, you can start by copying your character (http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/charcopy/character-copy.html) over to a test realm. Once you've had a chance to try things out, be sure to visit our Public Test Realm forum (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/1181024/) to discuss the patch.<br />
<br />
Classes: General<br />
<br />
Vengeance is no longer triggered by receiving damage from other players.<br />

<br />
The Tier 13 Balance Druid 4-piece bonus now also increases the damage of Starsurge by 10%, in addition to its current effect.<br />

<br />
Aspect of the Hawk now grants roughly 35% more attack power.<br />
Deterrence now also reduces damage taken by 30% while active.<br />
Black Arrow now ticks every 2 seconds for 20 seconds, as opposed to every 3 seconds for 15 seconds. The total damage dealt by the ability is unchanged.<br />
Lock and Load no longer benefits Arcane Shot, nor is it consumed by Arcane Shot.<br />

<br />
Mass Dispel should again prefer dispelling targets that have magic effects that can be dispelled.<br />
<br />
<br />
Dungeons &amp; Raids<br />
<br />
You can now form same-faction raids with Real ID friends, allowing you to enter Raid Finder in groups larger than 5, run older normal or heroic raids, or participate in Battlegrounds. You will not yet be able to run normal or heroic Dragon Soul with cross-realm raids of Real ID friends.<br />
Several typo fixes and clarified descriptions have been added to the Dungeon Journal entries for Dragon Soul.<br />
Players can no longer win multiple copies of the same item on a single Raid Finder boss kill. For example, a player who chooses Need on two set piece tokens or two weapons and wins the first, will not be eligible for the second on that particular boss.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Patch 4.3.2 64-bit PTR Client<br />
Another new PTR build went out recently, with no significant changes. However, it did add a 64-bit version of the client!<br />
<br />
A 64-bit client is now available for use with the 4.3.2 PTR. You can download it at the link below, unzip it into your PTR directory, and then run the executable to test it.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The 64-bit client is being distributed separately from the PTR as it is not yet supported for use with World of Warcraft.<br />
This can only be used with the 4.3.2 PTR, it is not to be used with the live version of the game.<br />
A Mac version is not available yet, though we are working on one and plan for it to be available in the near future.<br />
The game’s built in voice chat does not currently work in the 64-bit client.<br />
<br />
<br />
link (http://us.media.battle.net.edgesuite.net/downloads/wow-installers/PTR/WoWTest-64-Win-15171.zip)<br />
<br />
If you encounter any issues while using the 64-bit version, please report your findings in the PTR bug report forum (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/2359401/), and return to using the 32-bit executable.<br />

Blue Posts<br />
Account Wide Ignore<br />
This is something we'd like to add into the game in some capacity, particularly to compliment the upcoming BattleTag system. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/215509-account-ignore/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/1756043936?page=1#6))<br />
<br />
LFR Difficulty Too Low<br />
We actively encourage feedback on things such as the LFR, because we want to make it fun for everyone. Fun isn't wiping over and over because you have people in the group who are new to the raiding environment, or perhaps aren't up to speed on the latest tactics as you might expect from someone attending, say, an organised guild run. As we've said on numerous occasions, this is why we've designed LFR to be easier than normal raids, to enable a range of players — including less-experienced people or those with less-powerful gear — to see the content and gear up a little before perhaps trying it on normal, then later possibly heroic difficulty.<br />
<br />
However, feedback in the form of threads like this is not what we are looking for, nor does it tell us anything useful. If you find LFR lacks challenge to the point where you feel you can leave your computer during an encounter, I'd suggest, like others here have done, that you join a raid on normal or heroic difficulty, which should test your skills sufficiently. Insulting the people LFR is aimed at will not be tolerated. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/215495-lfr-for-apes/) / Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/3194021214?page=3#45))<br />

<br />
The change to deterrence is for raiding.... as it stands, hunters have only two defensive cooldowns: one works against a very small number of effects (deterrence), and one requires both a glyph and being in melee (glyph of raptor strike). This lets hunters use deterrence the way ret pallys use divine protection, resto/balance/cat druids use barkskin, mages use mage ward, warlocks use nether/shadow ward, rogues use feint/cloak of shadows..... etc.</div></div><hr />

OOOHHHHH I get it... It's just PTR and they will reverse this and screw us more, making us worse when 4.3.2 hits live. <br />

<br />
Yep, a 50% reduction could have put Vengeance in line PvP-wise. But yet again no, Blizz had to overkill when it comes to nerfs like these as usual.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bogrim</div><div class="date">2012-01-09, 02:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">ROFL. Yes, it's very balanced as it is. Go into tankform while dealing close to the same damage as you do as cat. Fucking OP.<br />
Close to the same damage? If I'm being trained as a Bear, and I pop Berserk, Survival Instincts and Frenzied Regeneration, I'll pump out three times as much damage as I could in Cat Form.<br />
<br />
For about 15 seconds. The instant people stop hitting me during my cooldowns my Rage dry up (unlike a self-supplying system like, you know, runes) and once my cooldowns are down I'm a cuddly stuffed animal again. A bear with Vengeance doesn't deal more damage than what a Recuperate can heal, and players that mindlessly zerg a tank don't win in the arena to begin with.<br />
<br />
I don't think you get how bad this is for Druids. I mean really, without damage Bear Form is just a soak. So you can be in either damage mode or soak mode, and that's about it. There'll be no penalty for pressuring a Bear anymore, just because of badly skilled players that don't know how to kite.</div></div><hr />

<br />
^^<br />
<br />
Let me tell you, fighting for a spot is tough enough for a hunter these days in a progression guild dps-wise, and then the average raid leader thinks &quot;wait, his two damage reduction cooldowns require him gimping his DPS even more,&quot; and they sit us. This'll go towards alleviating some of that, though both CDs will still require us to not be able to DPS to apply it (except on the few random bosses like Yorsh where you can DPS in melee). The full dodge part for things like Hours on H-Ultra is nice, but factor in that mail wearing classes have been traditionally low on health if they don't spec into their stam boost talents (Hunter vs. Wild, Toughness for enhance) and their lack of CDs (whereas enhance at least have shamanistic rage), and it made hunters pretty squishy all things considered. Now I can deterrence an onslaught on H-Blackhorn and not pray that one of the tanks is quick enough to get a melee add in the onslaught quick enough for me to raptor it.<br />
<br />
Looking forward to the SV changes too, with the reduced ICD of LnL already, should be able to regularly get two off one BA now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They can use more RAM, and they will likely perform a little better.<br />
<br />
32-bit apps are able to run on a 64-bit OS, because the OS drops the CPU into 32-bit mode before each time it schedules the 32-bit process for a chunk of CPU time. This operation, while not terribly slow, does have a cost, and it does happen frequently.<br />
<br />
Also, access to larger general purpose CPU registers means potential for more efficient calculations - assuming the devs actually bothered hacking in some 64-bit optimization - and this can also lead to performance gains.<br />
<br />
Finally, it's only relevant on 64-bit OSes in the first place, because a 32-bit OS is not going to run a 64-bit application.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For about 15 seconds. The instant people stop hitting me during my cooldowns my Rage dry up (unlike a self-supplying system like, you know, runes) and once my cooldowns are down I'm a cuddly stuffed animal again. A bear with Vengeance doesn't deal more damage than what a Recuperate can heal, and players that mindlessly zerg a tank don't win in the arena to begin with.<br />
<br />
I don't think you get how bad this is for Druids. I mean really, without damage Bear Form is just a soak. So you can be in either damage mode or soak mode, and that's about it. There'll be no penalty for pressuring a Bear anymore, just because of badly skilled players that don't know how to kite.<br />
<br />
...so actually, you'll be like an arms warrior that popped shield wall/shield block.<br />
Totally well-deserved nerf for ferals imho. <br />
<br />
(It's outside the point that blood dks/whatever prot specs are or aren't OP in PvP, my point is that if you're PvPing and you have to turtle up, you shouldn't be able to do close to -or more than- the damage you do normally.<br />
At least now we'll have one less spec that can do it.)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I run my normal team raid every week + LFR several times each week just to practice dps. <br />
Let's take Morchok as an example. <br />
<br />
I do 31-37k (!) on Morchok depending on RNG. <br />
<br />
Rogue pickpockets Hagara and does 42k. (A boss where they have to run away from Black blood several times).<br />
When rogues reach the second and third tier of legendary Q daggers they WILL murder everyone by so much it will be unreal.<br />
<br />
We get 6 percent dps nerf on 2/3 main dps spells gg.<br />
...<br />
<br />
The only time fire gets imba dps is if we cross the really high haste treshold where we get a lot of ticks on our DoTs and that happens only on Deathwing where we can do 60-70k. But that only happens if we are lucky and have every buff like Dark Intent, Spell haste etc.. <br />
<br />
This is probably the reason we get nerfed, maybe rather fix that than kill our dps in standard situations?<br />
<br />
<br />
Not talking about the fact that arcane is more viable on several fights so to min max we have to keep switching specs and of course using wrong reforging for one of them.<br />
<br />
Oh and the main dps cooldown of fire - Combustion - is entirely based on whether our Ignite bugs out or not so mages use like 2-3 addons to verify the real Ignite value.<br />

The only time fire gets imba dps is if we cross the really high haste treshold where we get a lot of ticks on our DoTs and that happens only on Deathwing where we can do 60-70k. But that only happens if we are lucky and have every buff like Dark Intent, Spell haste etc.. <br />
<br />
This is probably the reason we get nerfed, maybe rather fix that than kill our dps in standard situations?<br />
<br />
<br />
Not talking about the fact that arcane is more viable on several fights so to min max we have to keep switching specs and of course using wrong reforging for one of them.<br />
<br />
Oh and the main dps cooldown of fire - Combustion - is entirely based on whether our Ignite bugs out or not so mages use like 2-3 addons to verify the real Ignite value.<br />
<br />
Nuff said.<br />
I AGREE! Thats so bullshit. Already so hard to maintaitain high dps coz of rng of ignite, sometimes dps at boss without dps benefict around 39k and sometimes 29k. And u nerf us o.O</div></div><hr />

Does the new cross-realm raid mean that you can join regular instances with cross-realm members?<br />

I know that you can cross-realm group and then use LFG, however, there is no way to, say, run a friend through a regular dungeon on your 85 to try to get him a gear item.<br />

I'm still downloading PTR, but really the only thing I want to test is if you can enter regular or non-LFG dungeons cross-realm too.<br />

unfortunately we cannot use healers as examples of defensive cds, as they just heal themselves (besides holy priests have abilities like guardian spirit etc) which is their job, whereas a dps usually goes out of their way to survive (e.g. cant attack in deterrence/iceblock, or at the cost of rage/mana/energy or at least gcds). such a weak shaman may not be completely game breaking in pve but is a HUGE disadvantage to pvp. Saying that, survivability of a class a is major factor in progression raiding, and since shamans have neither good survivability nor dps, they are far more likely to be benched.. whereas other classes are far more valuable (especially in 10m).. for example, many classes can soak ultraxion twilights, a dispersion priest can soak a baleroc shard alone, fire mages can cauterize and soak a zonozz ball alone etc.</div></div><hr />

If I'm being trained as a Bear, and I pop Berserk, Survival Instincts and Frenzied Regeneration, I'll pump out three times as much damage as I could in Cat Form.<br />
<br />
For about 15 seconds. The instant people stop hitting me during my cooldowns my Rage dry up (unlike a self-supplying system like, you know, runes) and once my cooldowns are down I'm a cuddly stuffed animal again. A bear with Vengeance doesn't deal more damage than what a Recuperate can heal, and players that mindlessly zerg a tank don't win in the arena to begin with.<br />
<br />
I don't think you get how bad this is for Druids. I mean really, without damage Bear Form is just a soak. So you can be in either damage mode or soak mode, and that's about it. There'll be no penalty for pressuring a Bear anymore, just because of badly skilled players that don't know how to kite.<br />
<br />
So they nerf you down to the same as arms warriors, ret paladins and non-blood DKs. Why the hell should you be allowed to stack vengeance in bear form and do 3x the damage just because you specced feral? you spec feral dps, not feral tank.<br />
Arms warrior : goes def stance/shield wall = 50% reduction in damage dealt<br />
Ret pally : bubble /shield used = 50% reduction<br />
DK : blood presence, death striking/lichborne+DC healing = ??reduction, probably around 50%<br />
Feral druid: bear form = 300% increase in damage dealt + becomes invincible for 15 seconds<br />
<br />
Sounds absolutely fair and a much needed nerf to feral druids and blood DKs</div></div><hr />

This is a band-aid fix at best. Our problem is our scaling, not AoTh. DO the math, at best it comes out to like 900 or so AP, and I'm supposed to jump for joy because of that?

It should come out to about 1000 after the 10% AP buff, but i definitely agree that these are just band-aid fixes. Scaling is absolutely the issue for Hunters and so long as AotH is a flat AP buff and not a % it will continue to contribute nothing in the scaling department.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's that those 3-4 people can, and probably will, still win loot. The people who just sit there and screw up the encounter, will probably get loot. The healer that is doing a fraction of the others, will probably get loot.<br />
<br />
<br />
Obviously it's not supposed to be challenging for those who are experienced in any raid type environments, but it's the people that don't even attempt to do well on the encounter and still receive loot that people are complaining about.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, increasing holy radiance mana cost isn't going to make it any less amazing. It already costs a ton to begin with, good paladins will still know how to use it effectively without being useless for an encounter :P<br />
<br />
ps. Fire Mages complaining about nerf? Welcome to earth again, guys, how was it like being in space?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Aspect of the Hawk now grants roughly 35% more attack power.<br />
Deterrence now also reduces damage taken by 30% while active.<br />
Black Arrow now ticks every 2 seconds for 20 seconds, as opposed to every 3 seconds for 15 seconds. The total damage dealt by the ability is unchanged.<br />
Lock and Load no longer benefits Arcane Shot, nor is it consumed by Arcane Shot.<br />
Arcane Shot damage has been increased with roughly 320%.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
- Aspect of the Hawk gives 2000 AP<br />
roughly 35% increase will be roughly 700 AP<br />
with 30% from talent and 10% from raidbuff (143% AP increase) that will make 1001 attack power<br />
<br />
- Deterrence buff should help in pvp i guess (I dont pvp)<br />
<br />
- Black Arrow damage stays the same, but it has 10 ticks now instead of 5. So 100% more chance on Lock on Load proc<br />
<br />
- Lock and Load change is awesome. no more Arcane Shot mistakes :)<br />
<br />
- Arcane Shot damage buff is just a dream.... time to wake up....</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
If Blizz wanted to make LFR an inclusive mode for ppl who have no idea what the tactics for bosses are then they shouldn't have made it drop ilvl 384 tier gear. <br />
<br />
Look at the top guilds, some banned for exploiting noob mode to gear up, the guild which got world first having been running 20+ LFR runs a week to get people decked out in their t13 4pc straight away. The fact that an easy mode for non-raiders became seen as a make or break must farm like mad mode for top guild just demonstrates how horrible Blizzard's implementation has been.<br />
<br />
Had LFR dropped ilvl 378 non-tier gear it might have achieved what Blizz wanted. No-one running DS normal or HC would have been interested, and it could have been left for people who wanted to see content without any challenge. The current incarnation is a bad joke...<br />
<br />
...A bit like the oh look Holy Radiance is massively OP and makes Holy Paladins the best tank and raid healers in the game, let's increase its mana cost by 5%, that'll sort it out hotfix.</div></div><hr />

HEROICS, yes. I am able to enter and group with other 85s using Real-ID and both end up in the same place.<br />
<br />
However, I cannot seem to run a lvl 60 friend on another realm through, say, Underbog to get a specific items. Nor can I run a 78 through Cata regulars to get 308 blues. Whenever I try making a real ID group then entering an instance, we both end up in separate instances. I admit I have not tried summon as my toons are in a bank guilds, but other people's attempt at summons have not worked when tried.<br />
<br />
I'll try to test it further tho, I had always assumed you needed some mechanic like LFG to teleport people to the same place.</div></div><hr />

OP in pvp the whole expansion...check<br />
Op in pve first as arcane than as atrocious overbuffed fire...check.<br />
<br />
Fire is still op even with the 6% nerfs...and even if its not the top ranking pve specc by the wide margin it is right now you can just specc arcane and still have a top3 specc. if you cant accept that you should check your perspective.<br />
<br />
Mages have been OP in PvP since ever. I'm all for toning frost down in PvP. But hey...that has nothing to do with this nerf. You're a moron.<br />
<br />
Fire's problem is how Blizzard is handling how their DPS works, not the actual numbers. Fix that and Fire stabilizes. The insane numbers fire puts out has to do with...oh wait I already mentioned all this my post you quoted...but again you're a moron and don't actually read.<br />

Arcane is so horribly boring I played a resto druid and gave up my pre-determined spot for the Firelands legendary. If Arcane becomes the only viable spec (which it obviously will), like I said before (yep, you definitely are illiterate) I'd be shelving my mage.<br />
<br />

<br />
Hmm... as a fury/arms warrior the only damage mitigating cooldown i have is changing stances, throwing on a shield, and using shield wall... and that alone has a 5 minute CD.

Arcane is only boring if have no desire to go deeper and do more than your average 11111211112 spammer.

They probably could have just undone the 4.3 Vengeance changes in PvP situations to solve that issue. But no.<br />
<br />
I disagree that ret is underpowered, sure the damage is pretty weak outside of wings, but the offhealing capability is insane, been messing about doing 2v2 with a friend and I often see 90-100k word of glory crits, the damage with wings up is still pretty awesome too, even after the hammer of faceroll nerf.</div></div><hr />

I agree with what your saying arcain can be fun if you play it right , but with the new life brought back in to the fire speck its gave people so much more options than before . im sure that these nerfs are comeing because blizz thinks all mages have the legendary or something. I have been really enjoying playing fire in raids again and would just like things to be left alone . if its not broken , why fix it ... Focus more on rogues and Dks a little bit more . And priest healing could do with a look at aswell as paladin healing . i feel sorry for shamys . there like a forgoten healing class.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">greenn</div><div class="date">2012-01-10, 05:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">HEROICS, yes. I am able to enter and group with other 85s using Real-ID and both end up in the same place.<br />
<br />
However, I cannot seem to run a lvl 60 friend on another realm through, say, Underbog to get a specific items. Nor can I run a 78 through Cata regulars to get 308 blues. Whenever I try making a real ID group then entering an instance, we both end up in separate instances. I admit I have not tried summon as my toons are in a bank guilds, but other people's attempt at summons have not worked when tried.<br />
<br />
I'll try to test it further tho, I had always assumed you needed some mechanic like LFG to teleport people to the same place.<br />
<br />
like i said ive had several friends run me through all levels of dungeons with real id. actually, i tested it in stockade just now and it worked fine.</div></div><hr />

All because some idiot threatened to commit suicide because he got killed by a Blood DK. stop trying to make it look like the other prots were in on it too, alot of prots became prots because they got tired of being able to do nothing against blood dk's<br />

<br />

Another fine specimen of the hunt@rd.<br />
<br />
You know nothing of the mage spec. that is planned to get nerfed, the devs instead of fixing it's dependency on RNG that allows the massive damage spikes they reduce the baseline damage effecting the performance of the spec in all situations. You just mindlessly gloat..</div></div><hr />

<br />
Mage (Forums / Cataclysm Talent Calculator / Beta Skills/Talents)<br />
Fire<br />
•Fireball damage has been reduced by 6,3%<br />
•Pyroblast damage has been reduced by 6,2%<br />
<br />
why is it 6,3 do they mean 6.3? do they mean it was 6 now its 3? if it is infact 6.3 and 6.2 why did they get every other classes numbers correct with the decimal point and messed up on BOTH of ours. i highly doubt it's a typo... anyone know what this means?</div></div><hr />
