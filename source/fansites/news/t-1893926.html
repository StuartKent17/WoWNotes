Guess i won't be playing Overwatch then... can't understand why the all of a sudden don't release a game for mac. From their first day on they did games for both systems...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Blame Apple for wanting to be different from the whole rest of the industry:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shockeye</div><div class="date">2015-11-07, 03:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Artifacts will take some effort for other specs, but you should be able to switch specs. The further behind you are, the faster it goes. Keeping two Artifacts completely maxed out may take some more effort, but switching and catching up or keeping one Artifact a little bit behind shouldn't be too bad.<br />
<br />
Are artefact weapons upgraded via questing or raid and dungeon content? Concern is that for healers and tanks the off-spec artefact may upgrade faster than main spec due to more frequent use during level-up and max-level questing content.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Might have been a simple business decision that it wasn't worth the work to make a OSX version for the relatively small mac audience (http://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey) and focusing only on the 3 announced platforms (PC/PS4/XBONE).<br />
<br />
Could also have been apple dismissive stance on gaming as a whole with their hardware always using weaker mobile GPUs and pushing of their own graphic api Metal to the detriment of more widely accepted standards like OpenGL and/or Vulkan.<br />
<br />
Probably a bit of both.</div></div><hr />

<br />
All the things IIRC. You earn artifact power from doing lots of difference activities in the game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Almost all venues of play provide artifact power. I think pet battling is the only exception.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Respectfully, it's not AV's fault. It's apple's. I say that a dedicated Apple fan and supporter. But To be very blunt: Apple has turned its back on gaming. It has decided that internal graphics are fine (and they are for the vast majority of Apple's users) and outdated OpenGL is okay. <br />
<br />
When you have a 1500$ computer that won't run it as well as a 500$ off-the-shelf HP with a 150$ GTX 950 in it, then it's not worth supporting. <br />
<br />
I suspect they'll still support the current games, but a twitch shooter like OW is not the Mac's bailiwick.<br />
<br />

<br />
I am pretty sure Overwatch was supposed to be f2p? what happened<br />
<br />
No one ever said that. It was assumed by fans.</div></div><hr />
