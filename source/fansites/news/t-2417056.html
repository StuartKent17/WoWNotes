Users are reporting that their quest log is being wiped when changing zones. A fix has gone out but it may take a little while to hit your realm.<br />
I am not trying to diminish the impact of this issue at all, it is obviously a huge deal. Especially depending on the quest that was lost... Bugs are regrettable when they happen, and we do what we can to deal with the outcome. I don't want to make any promises on a resolution when I don't know what may be possible here.<br />
<br />
As an update, a fix has been found and implemented and it is populating through the live realms now. It will take a little while to cycle through and update across all realms/shard but folks should stop losing their quests.<br />
<br />
So the question is will quests be restored, including the status that the quest was in, or are we gonna have to start all over? lol<br />
I don't know if that is possible, Kamarel, but that is certainly part of the discussion about this situation. For the most part you should be able to just pick the abandoned quests back up, but for those who had partially or fully completed the quest, there may not be a way to verify that progress to restore it. One step at a time, let's get the quests to stop abandoning upon zoning first.</div></div><hr />

On one hand we have people proclaiming that the game isn't the same as it once was, and on the other we have people thinking it still is.<br />
<br />
Make up your minds. There is no &quot;resurrecting&quot; however, that'd suggest that it's been dead at some point.</div></div><hr />

They’re not going to put a game “away” when it still makes them millions and has a large player base. It’s a good job they don’t listen to the opinions of pretender forum game designers.</div></div><hr />

Exactly. I lost it on all my characters and they couldn't retrieve it for any of them. Still haven't got back to as many rares on my main (only had 4 to get at the time). It wouldn't have been as bad if once you got all a race's solves you could stop getting their digsites.</div></div><hr />

This has just started happening randomly within the last few hours, which suggests that it's probably the result of a hotfix or otherwise some long-standing systemic anomally that predates 8.0.1.<br />
<br />
I'm actually really curious about the nature of this bug.<br />
<br />

Still, feels like they should probaly, y'know, bring servers offline ASAP and do a rollback. Especially if the bug is still affecting people.</div></div><hr />

Noticed when I picked up the quests that it started as a bonus objective. Could that be a reason for the quests to disappear? Since it follows certain zones, so when you enter a new zone they just goes away.</div></div><hr />

You can only roll back so far. Some of these quests people lost are over a decade old. This is probably something they will not be able to fix for people that it hit, unless maybe you literally only had quests you picked up today.</div></div><hr />

wtf what are people doing with a 10 years old quest ?<br />

I'm playing since Vanilla and the only quest I have in my log are battle pet related... Only my alt have tons of quests in their logs (and I was not affected by this bug, as of yesterday)<br />
It's not a big issue at all for a lot of players, especially 2 weeks from a new xpack... <br />

I lost all the quest and most of the were raid quests, like Odin shit in that stupid raid I was on 959/1000 since yesterday and one hour later just puff. Considering I didn't play for 1,5 years and came back for the new expansion 4 days ago. Also those stupid fragmenst from red shitty nighmare raid with xavius. It aslo happened when I zones in LFR to kill gul'dan for quest. I'ts not like I lose 3 quest to kill quillboars and need to picke them up again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
These bugs always happen in prepatch. ZOMG just go back to read draeor, legion, wolkt launches... I won't even talk about vanilla and BC with the servers down AN ENTIRE DAY OR TWO... I can't even imagine the SS if that happened today.<br />

I've tried several mmorpg (Wildstar, AION, FF14, Conan, Terra, Rift,...) and I ALWAYS came back to wow (or stopped playing mmorpg for some months). You think wow farming is tedious ? Just try FF14...<br />

Probably the last time they did a power/ilvl squish. There are so many items and creatures in the game with lots of different abilities. Takes some time to catch every anomaly. And with every fix there’s a chance you break something completely different.</div></div><hr />

They had 10 in July and 1 in august. For a total of 11 for the pre-patch. For comparison they had 10 in January of 2018. Hot fixes happen because bugs happen. It is nothing new. Just be glad that they can fix so much with hot fixes instead of requiring patches all the time like it used to be.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But seriously, 14 days of non stop patches, bugs that wipe out all quests (gee thanks, lets do 10+ resets worth of raid clears, when i was nearly done with most of them, can't solo legion raids in bfa, and probably going to be hard to find people to complete old legion raids), no not talking about simple quests like kill 0/10 simple mobs where we talk about having to redo 5min of work, but raid/artifact quests)<br />
<br />
Playing on the alpha/beta it was clear this is rushed so hard for content that just wasn't ready, they just don't give a crap anymore, it's $$$&gt;anything for them, think even casual players will be shocked how little they have to do after a few months, it's going to be even less content than wod).<br />
<br />
Even the GM's know they have fucked up big time, giving 30 days game time left and right when reporting bugs.<br />
<br />
Will i still play the game?, yes probably, but seems highly likely i will pause midway through this exp if this s**tshow continues after 8.1</div></div><hr />

It is 11 in 14 days. At least get the numbers right if you are going to set arbitrary dead lines to fit your narrative. We had 10 in the month of January https://wow.gamepedia.com/Hotfixes#January<br />
<br />
And that wasn't an expansion launch period. Bugs happen. Stop acting like it is the end times because they are fixing things.<br />

Yeah, I'm going to assume that second part was not directed at me. Clearly. Like I said, I'm not playing currently and I'm simply glad that I was not affected by the bug. I keep them for nostalgia and to share with random raids for fun since you can't get them anymore any other way.</div></div><hr />
