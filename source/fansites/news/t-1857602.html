Blue Tweets<br />
Is timewarped gear ment to scale with your level? Warped gear i got at lv70, is still lv70 gear even tho i'm 100 now.<br />
No, Timewarped gear scales to your current level when created, but remains fixed there. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/637037993912483840))<br />

Ghostcrawler Tweets<br />
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br />
Developer Communication<br />
How about this question instead: &quot;what can developers do if they actually care about engaging meaningfully with (at least some section) of their playerbase?&quot;<br />
Great question.<br />
<br />
Let me say first that I don't want to come off across as the grandmaster of this shit. I make a ton of mistakes.<br />
<br />
1) Don't come across as arrogant. This is really hard because you do want to come across as confident. Players don't want to hear that you really have no idea what you're doing. I try to couch things in terms of intentions or goals rather than promises or certainties. I try not to take myself too seriously.<br />
<br />
2) Show empathy. Chances are the players are engaging because your game is important to them. Their idea or suggestion may be ridiculous. It might ruin the game. That doesn't matter. You still need to put yourself in their shoes and understand *why* they are saying what they are saying. This can be as simple as acknowledging that the player is upset. Being upset is a totally valid way for them to feel! Players are often better at detecting problems than they are at suggesting solutions. Try and understand the problems they are trying to solve. But at the same time, don't dismiss or belittle their suggestions, even if they aren't feasible.<br />
<br />
3) Build trust. This can take a long time and unfortunately can erode quickly. But if you have a reputation then players will often forgive the mistakes that you are almost invariably going to make.<br />
<br />
4) Be authentic. This is a great way to build trust. Be as honest as you can. Don't leak information or throw colleagues under the bus, but otherwise try and be transparent about your reasoning. Admitting mistakes here can help a lot.<br />
<br />
5) Don't get sucked into arguments. Yeah, I know: sometimes people on the internet are wrong. But it's not your job to win arguments. It's your job to communicate with players. If something has gone back and forth a couple of times, it may be time to move on.<br />
<br />
6) Stick to higher ground. This one is tough, but the fact is you are in a position of power since you are the one working on the game. If you pick on a player, even if they made an abusive comment and totally deserve it, you are going to come across as a bully. If you insult someone who insulted you, it's only your comment that will get quoted across the internet.<br />
<br />
7) Be transparent about the process. You don't want to convey that your opinion is set in stone, but you also don't want to suggest that it's up to player vote (unless it is). The way I try and describe it is that developers want to make informed decisions. The players provide the information, but the development team makes the final call.<br />
<br />
8) Don't get addicted. This is a mistake I see a lot of developers make who are new to community interaction, and no doubt I did it myself on my first job. Having players hang on your every word can be exciting. Making someone happy by promising a change can be rewarding. Just be careful. It's easy to over-promise. It's easy to neglect your day-to-day responsibilities by trying to be too responsive to player engagement. Players would rather have you for a year than every hour for only a week. <br />

Road to BlizzCon – Watch the Americas Regionals Live September 12–13<br />
Eight teams have qualified for the 2015 World of Warcraft Arena Americas Regionals tournament—one from Latin America, one from Australia and New Zealand, and six from North America. On September 12 and 13, three of those teams will advance to the WoW Arena World Championship at BlizzCon 2015 . . . and five will be heading back home.<br />
<br />
You’ll be able to watch the carnage unfold live on Twitch.tv/WoW on September 12 and 13 at 12 p.m. PT—but in the meantime, let’s meet the contenders who’ve risen through the ranks over the past few months<br />

ArenaNet made the base Guild Wars 2 game free to play over the weekend! You will still need to purchase the new Heart of Thorns expansion if you want to play the new content, but you can still play the base game for free without purchasing it. You can see the different account restrictions in the official FAQ (https://help.guildwars2.com/entries/95982157?_ga=1.244728133.132679802.1435399216). <br />

One the core game is free for them and two, anet has made the sensible desicion of only having them pay for heart of thorns if they want the full game. If I was a new player that would interest me very much, people in the game still don't quite understand it but I personally think it's a great move.</div></div><hr />

I don't think you understand free to play, it always has been as long as you buy the base game, nothing has change here other then that the full base game comes if you just buy the new X-pack and u get 100% of the game. while if u don't want to pay that u get 50% of the game. and even then most parts of the base game are locked up like extra bag space ect.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That wouldn't make much sense. They had a very solid income from people buying the game even at the reduced prices they usually went with. That and the in-game shop has been a very good model that honestly I wish WoW would adapt. There is no need for sub fees if you can put some real stuff up in the in-game store without compromising the rewards from playing the game itself. Making the old content free (some restrictions here though) and having people pay for the addon is the right way to go here.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Exedore</div><div class="date">2015-09-03, 06:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">GW2 made the core free to play because it has an expansion releasing Oct 23. It's akin to WoW having the base game include all expansions except the latest.<br />
<br />
The Free-to-Play version of GW2 is similar to WoW's free trial accounts, but far less restrictive (for example, GW2 free accounts can go to max level). Most of the restrictions are to prevent RMT bots and trolls from abusing the system.</div></div><hr />

But actually, it's also not just a simple trial. You can still do all the content from level 1 to max.</div></div><hr />

Yes, it's great for new players. But what about those that already bought the base game for 40-50 don't remeber how much it was. We still have to bus HoT for another 50 while new players get the same base game and HoT for 50.</div></div><hr />

Actually that isn't free to play. Heroes of the storm is free to play, Hearthstone is free to play. Guild wars 2 was just no subscription. You still bought something to be able to play, it was not free.</div></div><hr />

I don't think I will concentrate on farming them. It is still a nice side reward if you let's say play two years forward, do some TW dungeons (but not every time) and one day discover that you got so many coins that you can buy mount. It is same as with that mount reward for all achievements during years festivials (Winter Veil, Hallows End etc) - if you think of it like its farm then you may hate Blizz, if you think of it like optional cool reward for those who anyway like to do most of things during an event (and need some motivation to do all instead of most) then its perfect. I think that people get angry because they think that everything in game is to be achieved easily or during short time and yes most of things are (you can get plenty mounts by doing very little farm, making them or buying them for gold) but there are some very rare things aswell (like ZG mounts) that are just optional for those lucky or those persistent to farm.<br />
I wonder if people who whined so much about flying and how it not being available ruins game, now enjoy game so much that they got no time to write here how happy they are. Nope, actually, suddenly its so silent and people moved on from one thing to whine to another. No &quot;thanks Blizz&quot;, just &quot;yeah finally you gave us what we *deserved*&quot;. Sad. When I logged to WoW first thing that welcome me was someone commenting in trade chat that he is flying and bored already. Wish Blizz never made that stupid WoD flying as those who wanted it just dont deserve it.</div></div><hr />

I don't mind. Ive played this game since release and I'm quite happy to say I've made up the money that it cost me to buy. If I was a new player now I'd be more annoyed at the fact I'd have to pay twice more than only paying once for hot. It's more appealing. <br />
Not like blizzard that require you to buy all the expansions regardless and there are way more of those than gw. Yeh you can buy up to pandaland now in the chest thing. But you'll still.have to buy draenor and legion in order to play legion if you get me.</div></div><hr />

There are two mounts. Neither of them are &quot;impressive&quot;. I am a mount collector and you will not see me ride any of these mounts in front of other people to get my nerd on. Good luck grinding. I will try to reach 300 collection without these...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Mounts cost 5000 badges, and you get 500 for doing 5 tw per week. 10 weeks ~2.5 months and you got a mount. And this is only from the quest. ~4 bosses@5 badges per dungeon x 5 per week = 100. So 600 badges per week. ~8 weeks to get mount.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Was there the same kind of response when Violet Proto Drake was added? That took over a year to get... It seems like some folks still want everything handed to them on a plate. In 8 months time (or however long it actually takes), you'll see the players who have put the time in to get their relatively unique (and completely optional) mounts and can ride them with pride. Seems fair enough to me.</div></div><hr />

You can call me a casual scrub who wants everything handed to him, I don't care. Bottom line is I play this game to have fun and I'm not going to kill myself running dungeons I don't enjoy 120+ times in a week just to get one mount. I'm probably not going to do it gradually either, since the requirements are absurdly high and the benefits extremely low. One less tank in the queue Blizz.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because they've noticed that they shouldn't add recolors as shop mount.<br />
<br />
The point here is the bad design of it. Making people run old content for so long only to get &quot;new&quot; stuff.<br />
<br />
It's one thing to enter an old dungeon (that you can do as much as you want in a day) or raid, roflstomp it in a few minutes and hope for a drop (RNG) of an old item/mount. Another totally diferent is requiring people to run these (downscaled, so you won't roflstomp them in a few minutes or do just the boss that drops it) for a small amount of currency to buy an overpriced item (2 mounts and 3 toys), you need to queue for it, you need to deal with other players to get your stuff, etc.<br />
<br />
And we know they'll add more stuff later, so it's an infinite grind. It's already stupid when they do this with the new pets inside old raids, this is a new level of stupidity.<br />
<br />
Timewalking was all about redoing old stuff once in a while just for fun for whoever likes it and as an alt gearing mechanism for whoever wanted as a side reward. Now it's becoming something entirely diferent and it's not good.<br />
<br />
New things should be given in new content, unless it's a totally diferent new thing to the game itself, that you need to update all the old stuff to have it too (like the player housing decorations in other mmos, when they add the housing system years later, then they need to add all the stuff everywhere).<br />

Was there the same kind of response when Violet Proto Drake was added? That took over a year to get... It seems like some folks still want everything handed to them on a plate. In 8 months time (or however long it actually takes), you'll see the players who have put the time in to get their relatively unique (and completely optional) mounts and can ride them with pride. Seems fair enough to me.<br />
<br />
Yes, there was, since it would take more than one year (because of the one achiev that would take 2 or more years and was added later, so people who didn't care about achievements all of sudden had to care and were months and months late to the party). And it wasn't about the mount itself, it was about the only way to get 310% flight speed outside of raiding (the time limited glory of the wotlk raiding, wich one of the steps required no one in the raid dying on boss encounters).</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I don't think you understand free to play, it always has been as long as you buy the base game, nothing has change here other then that the full base game comes if you just buy the new X-pack and u get 100% of the game. while if u don't want to pay that u get 50% of the game. and even then most parts of the base game are locked up like extra bag space ect.<br />
<br />
<br />
That wouldn't make much sense. They had a very solid income from people buying the game even at the reduced prices they usually went with. That and the in-game shop has been a very good model that honestly I wish WoW would adapt. There is no need for sub fees if you can put some real stuff up in the in-game store without compromising the rewards from playing the game itself. Making the old content free (some restrictions here though) and having people pay for the addon is the right way to go here.<br />
<br />
I think anyone who lurks the news posts daily knows that he just writes some random thing to be the first comment. No mention why did he expect it, cause it would take too much time to write it and someone else would take his glorious first comment.<br />
<br />
<br />
Yes, it's great for new players. But what about those that already bought the base game for 40-50 don't remeber how much it was. We still have to bus HoT for another 50 while new players get the same base game and HoT for 50.<br />
<br />
What about those people who bought this mobile phone model for 500$ and now it's sold for 50$? Simple answer: the older the product, the less worth it is. What about WoW expansion packs? People paid full price for them on release, and now they are merged into vanilla and it's still cheap.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's fine if something take longer than 1 week, legendary quests, professions, raiding, and attunement (should bring back.) This is dated content, that offers 0 challenge. I don't mind that it takes longer than 1 week to get the mount, that's fine. 1-2 months of having to run them is cool. Though 5k for this mount, and if you a completionist, which most are, you have 2 mounts to get on top of all the toys, you'll need 15k badges. <br />
<br />
We will keep it simple, if you wanted to earn the mount this week, you get a free 500, and about 25 per dungeons. Need about 180 dungeon clears to get just the mount. So in 5 days, about 36 clears per day. They could have kept that longer and dropped it down to needing only about 80 clears...but I mean that's getting extreme. <br />
<br />
If you didn't do the quest at all and needed the 15k badges, that's 600 dungeons clears. So you need to run super old content, that they did nothing to change or update, or even make a challenge at all. That's worse than the SoO debacle, at least that one had interesting fights.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Mounts cost 5000 badges, and you get 500 for doing 5 tw per week. 10 weeks ~2.5 months and you got a mount. And this is only from the quest. ~4 bosses@5 badges per dungeon x 5 per week = 100. So 600 badges per week. ~8 weeks to get mount.<br />
<br />
Because every Timewalking event comes 3-4 weeks apart from eachother. We won't see, WOLK TW event until Oct 21st.<br />
<br />
Nexus gets you 40<br />
ATOK gets you 35/40<br />
Gudrake gets you 35/40<br />
Halls of Lightning gets you 35<br />
Utgarde Pinnacle gets you 35<br />
+500<br />
<br />
If you did five per an event, you'd get 690ish. 7 1/4 events to get a mount, around 6 months. So if you did it now, you'd get one mount in February<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
It's more like 6-7 because some months end up having two Timewalker events (such as THIS month).<br />
<br />
It doesn't, well it starts on the 30th but that doesn't really count. Next month has two.</div></div><hr />

Not really, you must be high on crack if you think that's the reason WoW is in this situation. The reason it's in a situation is, no engaging content. Sorry Timewalker Dungeons isn't engaging, the point of them doesn't even make sense. You don't need to do the mechanics, as you character still outdamages the encounter, you just walk in, stomp through everything. Rinse/Repeat. That isn't even fun, and then you put a mount behind it, anybody whose a collector now feels like its mandatory content for them to do. <br />
<br />
I don't see why they couldn't have made it 100 for a dungeon clear. Then you only need 50 runs to get the mount. 10 per day if your super extreme, and don't even ahve to do the quest. The grinders, will get it done and the other worst case scenario need to wait about 3 months, if they do 2 per day to get the mount. Nearly have to triple that math now though to get them. <br />
<br />
Ugh....running Nexus that much...that instance, sucked in WotLK when it was relative content.</div></div><hr />

Are you going to tell me next that old raid mounts should be in the store because you've soloed the raid 100 times now and still no drop?<br />
<br />
Major differences between 'soloing' raids and doing Timewalking dungeons. Raids - I'm doing solo, TW - Party of 5. Raids - Drop rates are larger and therefore generate quite a bit of profit on their own. TW - Doesn't even cover the cost of repairs to my gear damage. Solo Raid - MSV takes me about the longest and that's 30 minutes. TW - 25 minutes, as long as your healer doesn't fail....if he fails...have fun wiping. <br />
<br />
I didn't say the TW mounts should be in store, I said that they should be a bit easier to get. Instead of taking a full year, they could have easily had setup it to take about 2-3 months to get. 3 full TW week cycles and you should have enough to buy the mount - without obscene grinding. 1500 from the quest and they could have made it so just casually doing it you could get the 3500 you need. On top of that, guess what they can do for Timewalking if everybody got the mounts already....add more mounts...like they do to the store.<br />
<br />
The store doesn't have to be engaging content, Blizzard has a separate team that handles mounts. How hard is it for them to reskin a mount? Maybe a month of effort? <br />
<br />
They didn't give you 8 months of something to do, they gave you rehashed content, that is not engaging in any shape or form. That you still are to powerful for, back in Wrath or even BC, yo had to worry about CCing those mobs, layering your interrupt correctly. Did you bother perfecting tremor toteming the fear, from the Necromancer in Halls of Lightning? All the shamans I ran with last night didn't even both and just let it go through, because it didn't even matter.</div></div><hr />

It's one of the few MMOs where you're encouraged and are rewarded for doing content in &quot;low level&quot; areas. It's a shame WoW doesn't do this aside from a couple holidays, with the way they drop old content instead of adding to it, but you can't really without a level scaling system. Which would actually be interesting in WoW (especially on a PvP server), but that goes against the heart of the game where it's all about getting more powerful. Plus everyone would flip out. <br />
<br />
The only other MMO where I've seen a healthy population like that is FF14, albeit to a lesser extent than GW2 because they use multiple servers instead of phases/megaserver. And it's also due to level scaling with Fates and adding things for &quot;endgame&quot; players to do in old zones.</div></div><hr />

And with this way of thinking is why we have micro-transactions in almost all games nowadays.<br />

Times do change for the better or the worse.</div></div><hr />

The purpose of all this and the reason they even bothered to set up these timewalker dungeons in the first place, was so people could run the lower level dungeon with their friends that were level. These were not done to be used as some type of means to grind out a bunch of badge in a couple weeks and turn them into to buy stuff. All these badges provide, along with the items that can be purchase as an incentive to want to continue to help your friends and/or yourself level through the various content dungeons to lower the queue times for those that want to grind out dungeons while leveling. People always things like this into something there not setup of to be in the first place, because they son't ever bother to read in the first place.<br />

This mount take 8 months. XD <br />

<br />
This mentality is exactly why they put mounts in the store and people bitch about them doing that all day long. These mounts and other items that come from grinding out these badges were setup for people to help friends level through dungeons that are barely used. By have more people doing these dungeons it lowers the queue for the people that want to grind through dungeon, instead of grinding quest and mobs. <br />
<br />
This system and the items are incentive to help lower levels through various stage of content. It was not setup as some sort of grind fest, so people to could by stuff in a week or two. People always try to make thing into more than they actually are and this is why so many people are completely misinformed in this game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
actully.. it's not 8 months.<br />

40x3=120<br />

35x2=70<br />

120+70=190<br />

5 weeks, that's with out the 500 weekly.<br />
<br />
1140+500(total weekly) = 1640<br />
<br />
5000 / 1640 = 3 weeks.<br />

that's you doing 5 random dungeons and get all of them once a day, during the event. 3 WEEKS, not 8 months.</div></div><hr />

I don't feel like doing your math...but fact is: The event is only once a month(usually)...so your 3 weeks are still 3 months.</div></div><hr />

Little longer since timewalking is not every week, but easily pre-thanksgiving fest for those serious about farming it.</div></div><hr />

Honestly, I think the best solution would be this:<br />
<br />
Continue to make cash store mounts, but give free, (but time consuming) in-game methods of obtaining said mounts.<br />
<br />
<br />
I am also really surprised that Blizzard hasn't put a &quot;Mystery Box&quot; in the cash shop yet. Slap a $15-$20 price tag on it, guaranteed to give you a random mount you haven't obtained yet. <br />
<br />
They would make SUCH bank off it.</div></div><hr />

When you get something real quick - its NOT rewarding IMO. But lets say it takes you ONE YEAR to get an item and there are no shortcuts etc, once you get it - if feels good! Feels like you accomplished something. I dont know about others but i like the idea. I will most likely just do only a few dungeons per event but eventually i will pick up that mount, pet etc.</div></div><hr />

Not even worth trying to grind them. 5 TW if you never raided, for everyone else, dont think anyone cares.<br />
<br />
One of the mounts was supposed to be on the cash shop but was put into the game for free and is relatively easy to farm for. 2 Dungeons a month for 5 months and the mount is yours. If 10 dungeons isn't worth it then wow... They give the players what they want and players bitch.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arewn</div><div class="date">2015-09-04, 01:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I honestly expected GW2 to go Free to play earlier than this.<br />
They are still following the buy to play model overall.<br />
With the upcoming expansion, Arena Net had to face the problem of an increasing cost to entry for their game. Their solution to that is that a new player only has to buy what ever is newest. Everything else is packed into the &quot;base game&quot; and available for free. This also doubles as a free trial, since GW2 didn't have one before.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't think you understand free to play.<br />

The mount was meant for the store. People endlessly bitch about store mounts not being available as in game reward, but they make this one available and the same people bitching.<br />
<br />
It's not the same people, don't be ignorant. I hate cash shop mounts, I have zero issues with the 8 month wait. People should earn their rewards.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Deyadissa</div><div class="date">2015-09-04, 04:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's really just a version of WoW's free trial. You're locked out of a bunch of things until you actually pay for it.<br />
<br />
Uh no.<br />
<br />
It's a lot more than that. Hell you can play PvP at max level with all skills unlocked right now totally free within just 10 minutes of playing the game. This is not, hit level 20 and then buy the base game. This is basically, you have everything except Map Chat and being able to whisper more than a single person every 30 seconds (you are able to send whispers to people, just not 2 people at once within 30 seconds.), inability to send mail to other players. Effectively, these are only gold spammer restrictions. Everything else is unlocked, at least until the expansion hits next month.<br />
<br />
<br />
GW2 buyer model: I will wait the next expansion and I get this one for free too.<br />
Or you can play the base game for free? There's nothing to lose.<br />
<br />
If you're going with that philosophy it might be another 3 years before they release another expansion.<br />

Time does not equal difficulty. Take a look at Dark Souls game series for example, the game isn't actually that difficult. It is just time consuming. Anyone can read up on how to play and spend time trying to game the system, but overall it's not inherently difficult because nearly 10% of the players unlock all achievements on statistics.<br />
<br />
Getting a top .5% in PvP can be considered difficult, because no matter how much time you spend you'll likely always be bad at PvP, or no where near the level of top .5%.</div></div><hr />
