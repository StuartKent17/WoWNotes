<meta name="description" content="I did a few updates this morning : 
- Added the missing Motes of Fire farming spots on Shadowmoon and Blade's Edge Mountains maps 
- Added the list of the loots of Karazhan and Gruul's Lair bosses, I will update Kazzak/Doomwalker just after I posted this news. 
 
You will probably see some improvements on the raid strategies section, working on a few nice things and trying to put online more maps/strategy diagrams. Stay tuned !
