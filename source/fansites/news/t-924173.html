Battle.net Authenticator Changes<br />
If you use an authenticator – and we hope you do – you may soon notice that an authenticator prompt may not appear with every login. We’ve recently updated our authentication system to intelligently track your login locations, and if you’re logging in consistently from the same place, you may not be asked for an authenticator code. This change is being made to make the authenticator process less intrusive when we’re sure the person logging in to your account is you.<br />
<br />
We hope to continue improving the authenticator system to ensure the same or greater security, while improving and adding features to make having one a more user friendly experience. If you don’t already have a Battle.net Authenticator attached to your account, don’t wait until it’s too late - http://us.battle.net/en/security/checklist</div></div><hr />

now if it randomly asked for your authencator generated code when you log (like 50% does ask and 50% doesn't ask) then i'd be a bit more approving, just a bit.</div></div><hr />

This changes nothing for you. You won't be asked to enter your authenticator code any more than you already do. If you're worried about your in-laws accessing your accounts, get better in-laws.<br />

People don't give these guys enough credit. While exploits will always exist for everything, regardless of the precautions you put in place, Blizzard isn't stupid enough to present something of this magnitude without doing the research first. The script kiddies in the (official) thread and twitter presenting examples of how to break it are being asinine and have no clue how it works. I'm not going to claim ignorance, seeing how I don't know how it works either, but I think people are overreacting just a little. Maybe an opt out would be a decent idea just to appease the rumblings if one could be implemented.<br />
<br />
While I don't blame people for being a little cautious, and rightfully so... ease up on the pitchforks.</div></div><hr />

A change that saves you about 3 seconds when logging in would be the difference between you quitting and continuing to play :| ? <br />

I like this change but it's not something that would have even 1% influence on my decision to play the game.<br />

In reply to the people with security concerns. It may allow you to choose if you to be asked for your authenticator every time you login regardless of location. We don't really know how it will work yet.</div></div><hr />

No because if someone from a different PC tried logging in, he/she would get the authenticator request. It's only the PC that your account is frequently used on that WON'T be repeatedly asked for the authenticator. Different PC = authenticator request.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Blackspur</div><div class="date">2011-06-17, 12:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Right let me lay this out for all you to inept to understand this most basic of concepts.<br />
Currently the Authenticator system asks you for your code every time you log in, now for some this is slightly annoying especially if you have a terrible connection and may be prone to D/C's. This new system however detects if you are logging on in the same location repeatedly, and if so then it will not ask you for your code. The two made 'arguments I have seen in this thread. <br />
<br />
1) herp derp i cant play a freiends house herp derp. Seriously did you not read the post? If you happen to log in at a different location then it will prompt you for an authenticator code as it does now. <br />
<br />
2) Proxy IP server. Do you really think a multi-billion dollar company would solely base your location off of your IP, seriously?</div></div><hr />

What you just described is possible with the previous system.<br />

Ok so what if over the course of time you have some malicious software lurking around your computer and you dont know it..

I'd guess that the client on our end can see our PC's MAC address though and transmit that to blizzard's server which they could verify on future logins by repeated transmission of said MAC. That, plus IP confirmation. And whatever else they add with it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The phone authenticators used 8 digits. The little dongles use 6 digits<br />
<br />
<br />
And I'd like to say this is very similar to Steam's system, where every time you log in from a new computer you get sent an email with an authentication code.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This only applies if you are using the same computer and internet connection. If your account is trying to be accessed anywhere else it will still ask for the authenticator. I personally like this and am glad they are moving their technology forward.</div></div><hr />

The only difference will be that you won't get an eMail with a verification code, but will be asked to user your authenticator.<br />

You ready? Good. If you're on your desktop, and you log in a number of times (lets say 20), your authenticator will kick in for the first 10ish (Nothing has changed, your router hasn't released/renewed IP addresses, everything has been the same in the past 12 hours), and then maybe for the last 10 you'll have to enter your authenticator 5 times, maybe more, maybe less.<br />
<br />
Now, evil man Fisher wants to steal your account. He tries to log into your account using a proxy through France, but oh no! He must use an authenticator to access your account! Things don't match up, his computer doesn't match your computer, so forth and what not, so he has to enter the authenticator that you have on your keychain. Your privacy is not compromised. If you're worried about a shared computer with people getting on your account, don't share your password to your account or your profile.Oh, and always use protection. Viruses can be dangerous. There are good free anti-virus programs out there, as well as anti-malware programs that work well. This will help foil keyloggers.<br />
<br />
This has been a public service announcement. You may return to your incessant whining again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A trojan could also easily get access to a MAC or IP as well. There will probably be a unique verification that ties it to your specific PC as well as your IP, MAC &amp; Location. They should be able to detect a proxy attempt so if your MAC/IP were spoofed in another country (like china), they should in theory know and then it will request an authenticator code.<br />

This can overthrow even the authenticator with ease, even better they don't even need to fake the ip address. Most of you are talking about paranoid cases. Showing how they track your pc(there are countless things that can be checked... without even sending packets back to blizz) would be nice, existing methods doesn't mean they use them... on the other side it might point things to unwanted ppl.<br />

Also bnet 2.0 is doing fine pachet decryption wise, also warden signals are out of bounds as well (that is why a clientless bot will not work for this game).</div></div><hr />

Yes I'm aware you can mask an IP, but they're not using just an IP address to verify. Also, if they use MAC and IP verification and a login attempt comes from china through a UK proxy, they WILL know about it and then the other person will see a nice little authenticator prompt.<br />

If this change does anything at all, it will add more security onto your account. Why? ... Man in the middle attacks - previously you would enter your email, pass and authenticator code and the &quot;man in the middle&quot; would login your account before the code reset, HOWEVER, now if you enter your email and password, the &quot;man in the middle&quot; will get your email and password but when he tries to login with that, he'll be asked for an authenticator code, which he doesn't have.</div></div><hr />

Faking an IP address is easy with online proxies but that's because you're using their IP. They are actually in that location, you can't just pick any old IP and decide to use it, you have to have some connection to that IP such as your location...</div></div><hr />

The ip I am using with my provider (Sky Broadband) can't be used by a online proxy servers, only Sky have access to these IP addresses.

<br />
To be able to install software on a modern computer remotely you probably need to use an unfixed exploit in the victim's OS/software or use social engineering. This is not easy stuff. Even if you are able to get the user to install your software you also need to keylog their password and also hope Blizzard is not basing their location on just IP-addresses (which they said they aren't anyway).<br />

A simple warden like packet will burst your bubble to pieces. They can intercept warden data, but they haven't decrypted yet the &quot;ok go&quot; signal that warden uses to check if it is still working on your machine or not.

This is not easy stuff. Even if you are able to get the user to install your software you also need to keylog their password and also hope Blizzard is not basing their location on just IP-addresses (which they said they aren't anyway).<br />

They been using SQL injections and/or exploits in old versions of servers most of the time to hack websites.<br />
<br />
Yeah, but how does a hacker nowadays get an account hacked? right with an unfixed exploit or the user installs some bad software and when you have a vpn tunnel+remote controll of a system you should know that you can fake everything you want<br />

<br />
They won't be guessing. They can use multiple ways to determine that you're using the same PC such as what OS you use, your PC's MAC &amp; IP, your router's MAC and IP, your ISP, your exchange, your PC's hardware/product key. If even just one of them is not correct then the authenticator request will pop up.<br />
<br />
If they spoof your IP/MAC and tunnel through a proxy to pretend they're in the same country as you, I'm sure Blizzard will be able to tell that by various means of detection. I mean they could track your average latency for one. Tunneling through a proxy from China to the UK would surely have a big latency difference for example.<br />
<br />
All it would take is the slightest red flag and at that point, the authenticator request would pop up.</div></div><hr />

If this change does anything at all, it will add more security onto your account. Why? ... Man in the middle attacks - previously you would enter your email, pass and authenticator code and the &quot;man in the middle&quot; would login your account before the code reset, HOWEVER, now if you enter your email and password, the &quot;man in the middle&quot; will get your email and password but when he tries to login with that, he'll be asked for an authenticator code, which he doesn't have.<br />

Exactly. When I got my new computer up and running, even my bank account was able to tell that I was on a new computer and asked for me to verify it was me via a security code sent to my phone (even when I was still under the same router/location).<br />

I know that, it's just an example of one of the many ways Blizzard can validate where you're logging in from each time. Every PC is unique, tied in with the IP, MAC and location means they stand a good chance of knowing if it's a different PC being used to login to WoW.<br />
<br />
**edit. I just remembered there's also the IPv6 as well. Not sure if IPv6 is even in use yet, but that's a further validation check that could be added.</div></div><hr />

Most banks, online brokerages, etc. have systems in place that add a level of security requiring security questions to be answered on login. Guess what happens when you log in from the same location with frequency? That's right, the system detects, probably using very similar if not the same technology, where you are logging in from and you do not have to answer the security questions from that location. The company I work for uses this technology and my bank does. If this technology is good enough and safe enough to use with accounts where people hold thousands, maybe even hundreds of thousands of dollars per account, don't you think it's good enough to safeguard your video game account?</div></div><hr />

an enterprise level of security doesn't just validate your IP or your locations, but they also validate your Unique ID, username, password, login pattern. The unique ID is something that server generate from your computer spec software or hardware. everyone will have different unique ID and there is noway you can generate the same unique ID. this is why even hackers can get your username, password, IP addresss, or hw address, it's still not possible to get login directly without the authenticator message popup because of the difference in Unique ID. Blizzard may also have implemented public key encryption into wow, it makes even harder for sniffers to sniff your input.</div></div><hr />

now if it randomly asked for your authencator generated code when you log (like 50% does ask and 50% doesn't ask) then i'd be a bit more approving, just a bit.<br />
<br />
Very very risky would NOT be the authentication system becoming more intelligent, as they're saying. Very very risky would be the solution you proposed as a better alternative: an authenticator that works only 50% of the time, thus giving you no assurance that a hacker wouldn't access the account with no need for the authenticator.</div></div><hr />

While this is partly true, it will at first require your authenticator just to verify! Then in the future if one small verification detail is out of place, it'll ask you to re-authenticate. But yeah, other than that, it's now just a free in game pet for most of the time :)</div></div><hr />

1. don't share your password, and your friends and family won't &quot;hack you&quot; at home.<br />

<br />
You and many others in this thread should learn to read. Did it say anything about locking your account? Nope - not one bit. It says if you log in frequently from the same location you won't have to input your authenticator code. If you log in from another location you will. This compared to the current behavior, where no matter how many times you log in from the same location you'll be asked for the code each and every time. This adds convenience, not inconvenience.<br />
<br />
It's already saved me typin' a code in upon login just a few moments ago. I've had the same ISP and IP address for 9 years and now Blizzard can tell that I'm obviously at my house using my own computer. Voila! Did not have to input my code.<br />
<br />
This has the side effect of saving me some hassle when typing the codes as well: I'm left-handed and use the number pad and surrounding keys for ALL my battle abilities/macros/spells/etc. Since that limits the keys that are within reasonable range of my fingers, I've turned the NumPad 0 key into a Ctrl key instead. Now I won't have to push the 0 in the top row above the letters when typing authentication codes, since I only WoW from this one location anyway :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
In which case you would have been using the authenticator anyway. (And still will be, unless you remove it manually) If you log in from several different places the net effect will be no difference for you. If you log in from the same IP address (and whatever other methods blizz uses to verify a &quot;home&quot; computer) every time you play, however, it is a small quality of life change.</div></div><hr />

Lazy Lazy.<br />
<br />
Firstly, how is anything you wrote related to this issue at all? Unless you're implying your friends will keylog your WoW account and access it from your home and steal gold while you're in the bathroom, well - maybe you should take the laptop with you.<br />
Secondly, how is this lazy of them? Do you think they manually make every person with an authenticator who logs on enter a code and this will let them cut down on that? It's all automated in case you didn't know and what they're doing is the opposite of lazy since it actually takes some time to implement this.<br />

<br />
While I don't know the details on that, I daresay that would have just been a DDoS attack (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack) which is just them overflowing their server with requests. That's not hacking. Not even close. Although it is arguable that the machines used for the attack were &quot;sleepers&quot; that got a virus that enabled the attacker to use their machines to help send requests, which is technically hacking. Was more than likely the Chinese or some hacktivist group that performed the attack.<br />
<br />
If any group wanted to do that they would be targeting Blizzard, not the individual users, and I doubt Blizzard is using an authenticator to keep all their data secure, so the argument is irrelevant. A hack on that level to steal accounts would be useless anyways as it would effect all users and make gold selling useless (no users, no demand, no buyers). This type of attack on Blizzard would be focused on destroying their business and stealing our IRL account information and depending on how Blizzard stores that info (not related to authenticators at all) we may be much safer than Sony's userbase was.<br />
<br />
As for your point about anything being hackable, this is completely true. No security is 100% guaranteed to prevent hacking, but there are ways to make it not worth the effort.</div></div><hr />

My authenticator is on my iPhone. So I have to enter my iPhones password, then find the icon, wait a second or two for the program to load, then hope the code isn't at the end of it refresh timer, enter the 8 digit code.</div></div><hr />

I lived with a guy who was in a wheelchair, (and therefore, home all the time) in close quarters, where he was capable of figuring out my password if he simply paid attention at the right time. He liked wow and tried to log in to it several times while I was at work, and the authenticator that I keep on my keyring is what kept him out. If he were to, say, wait till I'd played a long session and then left for work, he could possibly log in immediately after I left and possibly get in. This same situation could apply to siblings, college roommates, etc. Yes, there are things one could do with one's password to deal with such a situation, but the whole reason you HAVE a secondary hurdle is because the FIRST hurdle isn't foolproof. The solution is simple: give us a toggle somewhere in the UI for this, allowing a choice.</div></div><hr />

This system is going to use much more than your IP address alone. That would be plain stupid.<br />

It really doesn't matter how many combinations of unique items they want to come up with. All it will take is to have someone figure out what it is. Doing that won't even be that hard either. They need an opt-out for this, DNW.</div></div><hr />

Considering the absolute vast majority of consumer IPs are rotating because the IPv4 limit was reached, this will use your subnet as a way of verifying you, the same way true website bans work since resetting your router gets around level 1 IP bans.<br />

This new change is not liked by me at all. What if somebody managed to take my laptop when i wasnt looking? Accounts could be hacked soo easily, waste of an authenticator. And to save time when youre dc'd in a raid? It takes two seconds to enter in a SIX digit number...<br />
Are you stupid?<br />
THEY WOULD STILL NEED TO INPUT YOUR PASSWORD, unless you are an absolute fool and keep all your passwords (including your World of Warcraft one) in a text file on your desktop under the name &quot;ALL MY PASSWORDS.txt&quot;.<br />
If your laptop gets taken from you, whilst you are sitting there, logged in to your account and then you get hacked because of it, well sir, you deserve to be hacked.<br />
<br />
<br />
Because absolutely nothing can spoof an IP address.<br />
Idiot. Don't try and pretend to be smart.<br />
<br />
<br />
hmm seems stupid...hubby and i log in from my brother &amp; sister in laws computers often when we are visit his mother...I dont think this is a good idea, but w/e its blizzards choice.<br />
&quot;w/e its blizzards choice&quot; - Don't make ignorant remarks.<br />
Nothing has changed for you.<br />
<br />
<br />
Terrible. Every time I have friends over for a Raid (they bring their laptops to my place since I have the best internet) we're going to have to deal with crap.Or (OMG ACCOUNT SHARING) when a friend gets stuck in sw and cant log back in during peak times, I usually log them in and run them out of the city.As for me, entering 6 numbers isn't a hassle, and takes 5-10 seconds at most. Lazy Lazy.<br />
This makes no sense at all?<br />
Nothing has changed, you will still be inputting Authenticator codes if you do not log into said account numerous times from one location? Which you clearly don't as they are your friends, who play at home usually, right?<br />
<br />
<br />
they're really gonna risk switching around security when all these hacks are floating around? they might be really secure but who knows what flaw this could potentially cause in the system.<br />
<br />
this is an awful idea. i had the dial in authenticator for a while, which is supposed to work on the same concept of having to call in to get the code when you're logging in somewhere out of the ordinary and i got hacked<br />
<br />
Ok so what if over the course of time you have some malicious software lurking around your computer and you dont know it.. One time not logging in using the authenticator could mean your account getting compromised... i honestly dont see the point of an authenticator if its only used half the time.<br />
<br />
I don't want them to know where I am! O_o<br />
<br />
Really hope we'll be able to toggle this option. Any security measure can be breached if someone wants to bad enough. WoW shares no passwords, gets changed peroidically, and I ENJOYED knowing that the <br />
only way to get onto my account was to sit here, grab my phone, put in the code to unlock it, and load the app for the number. I'm already paranoid enough about system and information security... now if something happens and I randomly get asked for an auth code.. Shit will hit the fan.<br />
You are all morons.<br />
<br />
<br />
This seems like a REALLY risky move, considering all of the LulzSec/Anonymous hacking going on lately.<br />
<br />
Guess we'll see what happens.<br />
You really think &quot;LulzSec/Anonymous&quot; are the only groups of hackers around? Think again.<br />
You really think this has only been happening &quot;lately&quot; ? Think again.<br />
There are bigger and worse organisations, but I would think these groups have bigger targets to deal with than hacking into YOUR World of Warcraft account and stealing all your gold coins. Which anyhow, if said event does take place, you can easily ticket a GM and have everything stolen back within an hour.<br />
<br />
- Simple responses for simple individuals.<br />
<br />
<br />
If this change does anything at all, it will add more security onto your account. Why? ... Man in the middle attacks...<br />
Well said Sir, it's good to see some have brains in this community.<br />
+ praise to numerous others as well but this post is already long enough.<br />
<br />
<br />
I myself have gamed online for plentiful years and never been hacked once. Want to know why I haven't, and numerous other people like me also haven't?<br />
I do not click retard links that claim I've won a prize on websites.<br />
I do not click retard links that direct me to a FREE WOW GOLD WEBSITE.<br />
I do not click links to obvious phishing websites (and when I say obvious, YES THEY ARE FUCKING OBVIOUS - LOOK AT THE URLS)<br />
I do not follow links in stupid spam emails.<br />
I do not download retard programs that claim will double my money and create me epic swords.<br />
And above all, I am not a fucking idiot.<br />
At the end of the day if you get hacked, it's your own fault 99.99% of the time, simple as that.<br />
<br />
This is not an &quot;EXTREMELY RISKY MOVE&quot; on Blizzard's part.<br />
<br />

You'll have to stop using the internet then... any website you visit has a pretty good idea of where you're at. Not to mention it's not based on your actual location.. it's based on many different factors (one being a rough estimation of your location).<br />
<br />
For everyone that thinks this is a bad change.. I'm sorry but they already have a system like this in place. My girlfriend tried to log in my account (she lives in another country right now) and it forced me to change my password due to &quot;suspicious login activity&quot;. Blizzard ALREADY has a system similar to this in place, what they are doing is making it so that your authenticator is less annoying to use.<br />
<br />
Maybe you shouldn't judge the technology before you understand it... just a thought.</div></div><hr />

<br />
At first the authenticator is a pain to use and I cursed every time I logged in, but after a few weeks it became second nature and I don't have a second thought about it when I log in ... even when I get disconnected and need to reconnect quickly.<br />
<br />
Personally I think they should improve security for those without authenticators, like offering a screen keyboard option to let people click their password instead of typing it in to defeat keyloggers. I guess you could do the same with the authenticator code, but it would be less of a benefit there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Blizzards Warden program would have an anti remote connection feature in it somewhere. <br />
<br />
A similar thing can be done with the current system anyway, the trojan logs your keypresses and transmits it back to the hacker (so they have your password and current authenticator code), the trojan disconnects your connection before the code can be transmitted (the codes are single use so this stops it being wasted), the hacker then quickly enters in your info as well as the current code. <br />
<br />
If anything this type of hack will be hampered by the new system, because they wont be able to get your authenticator code 9/10 log ins and thus cant access your account</div></div><hr />

ofc they will not reveal on what is the fingerprint based on, but I assume the client sends more information to blizzard login server than an IP address. It's all speculations you people come up with, calm down and enjoy not having to put in the 6digits everytime you login or when you get dc'd.... actually you want to login as faster as you can back into dungeon after you got dc'd.</div></div><hr />

That has absolutely nothing to do with the Authenticator system. Where did you get that idea?<br />
<br />
Blizzard have always monitored account log in areas and they get locked if theres any anomalies in log in patterns (I.e random log ins from the middle of Africa when you live in the US). <br />
<br />
You have an equal chance now of getting your account locked as you did last week, the change to the authentication system wont change that.. Stress Less.</div></div><hr />

Nothing has changed, you will still be inputting Authenticator codes if you do not log into said account numerous times from one location? Which you clearly don't as they are your friends, who play at home usually, right?<br />

You really think this has only been happening &quot;lately&quot; ? Think again.<br />
There are bigger and worse organisations, but I would think these groups have bigger targets to deal with than hacking into YOUR World of Warcraft account and stealing all your gold coins. Which anyhow, if said event does take place, you can easily ticket a GM and have everything stolen back within an hour.<br />

I myself have gamed online for plentiful years and never been hacked once. Want to know why I haven't, and numerous other people like me also haven't?<br />
I do not click retard links that claim I've won a prize on websites.<br />
I do not click retard links that direct me to a FREE WOW GOLD WEBSITE.<br />
I do not click links to obvious phishing websites (and when I say obvious, YES THEY ARE FUCKING OBVIOUS - LOOK AT THE URLS)<br />
I do not follow links in stupid spam emails.<br />
I do not download retard programs that claim will double my money and create me epic swords.<br />
And above all, I am not a fucking idiot.<br />
At the end of the day if you get hacked, it's your own fault 99.99% of the time, simple as that.<br />
<br />
This is not an &quot;EXTREMELY RISKY MOVE&quot; on Blizzard's part.<br />

If someone takes your laptop then they will still likely be asked for your auth key as your laptop does not have its very own IP address. IP address comes from the physical location not the object used to login at that location.</div></div><hr />

It dont make it useless to you at all, if you log on from a different location, i.e round your mates. itll ask for the code. subsequently, if your account is being accessed from a totally wierd location it'll ask for the code, so your account is still secured by the authenticator unless thefts like using your comp to play wow while their stealing your belongings</div></div><hr />

There are countless ways of creating a UUID (universally unique identifier) for a PC there is no way for someone to fake this ID unless the encryption algorithms or whatever Blizzard is using to create this ID get stolen or something or if someone broke into your house and log in from your pc.<br />
<br />
A simple example (not entirely accurate though) will be creating an ID by reading the serial numbers of various hardware parts hashing with a unique key like the mac address of your router and voila you got your own unique key than cannot be copied unless you know how it was created in first place.<br />
<br />
The ID is unique by all means, it's like your retinal signature, it's perfectly safe and you can safely stop whining and embarrassing yourself.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Too the people saying but what happens if they steal my laptop etc ok simple answer is they take it somewhere else and connect it to a NEW ip address you silly poeple it,ll then ask for teh authenticator code.now unless they managed to steal your authenticator as well they aint getting in .<br />
<br />
Blizzard have implemented this for peoples convineance just because it doesnt ask you for the code from the ip you log in every single day doesnt mean it isnt working or still protected.<br />
<br />
So unless someone steals your laptop manages to connect to your internet hub within 100 meters or whatever the range is without you seeing them you have shit all to worry aobut .so stop worrying if you dont like it remove the authenticator from the account see what happens and find something more worthwhile to actually worry about .</div></div><hr />

2. Zomg they have access to my computer: a. they do not know your password (still) b. put a god damned windows password on it c. lock your room d. shoot anyone who touches your PC without your permission e. kensington lock.<br />
<br />
3. It's not just by IP address, just because that's the only term you learned, no need to run your circles like a headless chicken on the forums.<br />
<br />
4. Pretty sure their experts know what they are doing. Nuff said.<br />
<br />
Bottom line: don't be an idiot and nothing changes. :)</div></div><hr />

If you really think you are smarter than the hackers out there that know backdoors and tricks you never ever had a single clue that they even existed I have news for you: You are not. You just got lucky, that's all. All the &quot;security software&quot; out there can and has been hacked several times and they fixed it until the next hack. Companys like Microsoft got hacked, Sony got hacked, Joe Average with his level 30 WoW toon got hacked. If you think you are too smart to get hacked, think again.<br />
<br />
Your post is lacking logic.<br />
If we accept it as true then every second of your life your can be bombarded by enemies while sitting on your pc.<br />
Someone needs a reason to attack you as a person.<br />
Comparing Sony with a random WoW player is making logic sad and universe is imploding.<br />
Attacks that target groups of users are based entirely on users awareness and hoping that user is dumb enough to fell for it there is no magic tricks every attack is waiting for a door to be opened by you.<br />
<br />
<br />
I prefer my security the way it is and don't want to water it down, thank you very much.<br />
<br />
It's not watering anything down you just lack the technical background to understand how wrong you are.<br />
I don't know how to make you understand it but let's say that what are you claiming it's like saying <br />
&quot;I painted my house door white so now i have a higher chance of getting robbed&quot; it makes no sense and that's how dumb your claims are.</div></div><hr />

While it definitely will make the whole disconnection issue less annoying, it also opens up some issues with shared internet connections and the like.<br />
<br />
Personally I'd prefer some sort of &quot;grace period&quot; where for 10 minutes after you disconnect, your Authenticator is not required to connect from the same IP address as you previously connected from. This way getting booted isn't a problem, but if you share your computer, or log in from an internet cafe, it reduces the risk of account theft.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
It is you sir who is the moron, because the mobile authenticators (iPhone, iPod etc) as a matter of fact are 8 digits (just checked this on my iPhone). Have a nice suicide, your contribution to the increased oxygen supply is appreciated. :)<br />
<br />
<br />
Second, back to the point of the post. Many of you seem to be under the false assumption that the authentication system is turning off the mobile authenticator all together. This is not the case. What is happening is this, the system is checking a number of things including; 1, where are you logging in from (ie, IP address and service provider), 2, is the computer that you're logging in FROM is the one that you normally do. If either (or both) of these conditions are failed, you are presented with an authenticator screen - if passed, then you will enter the world. <br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

Not solved at all. Mac is actually easiest thing to copy and change. Each network card has its own but its also simple as hell to change it. Just few click here and there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It seems to me that this just opens an avenue of exploitation for hackers. But then I am going to assume that they have people at Blizz who know a lot more about security than me, so I'm just going to put my faith in them. Its not as if it can't be reverted if an exploit is found.</div></div><hr />

It means those with an authenticator can live without the pain of a disconnect at a bad time, delaying them anymore then it has to.<br />
<br />
But, with this there are a few things people should know:<br />
<br />
[1] Blizzard are not just starting to track your I.P. address, they've been doing it since the launch of World of Warcraft, so don't panic about them suddenly knowing where you live.<br />
<br />
[2] This system will mean that you can log into any computer around the house, as internet I.P Addresses are connection based (Ie: Household, Workplace) instead of each individual computer. This means should you have a disgruntled member in the house hold who knows the password, they could get into the account from another computer.</div></div><hr />

Overall I like this very much, it's incredibly tedious using that thing what with the memory errors and random dc's.</div></div><hr />

Not true, I use my desktop most of the time, the laptop sometimes, every time I've tried to log onto my laptop, its asked for a code.</div></div><hr />

If it was such a hassle to push a button and uhhg type a 6 digit number in people would of never purchased an authenticator in the first place.. Dont change it.</div></div><hr />
