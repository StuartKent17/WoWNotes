The official patch notes have been updated to reflect the changes from the latest build. <br />
<br />
Arenas<br />
Beginning with season 7, players will no longer have access to the newest season's weapons or shoulder armor and will not qualify for the Gladiator title/rewards with ratings from the 2v2 bracket alone. Ratings obtained through 3v3 and 5v5 game play will be required for these rewards, while the rest of the newest season's items will remain available to players in all brackets (standard rating restrictions still apply).<br />
<br />
Items: General<br />
Resilience: No longer reduces the amount of damage done by damage-over-time spells, but instead reduces the amount of all damage done by players by the same proportion. In addition, the amount of resilience needed to reduce critical strike chance, critical strike damage and overall damage has been increased by 15%.<br />

Blood of the North: Reduced to a 3-point talent. Increases Blood Strike and Frost Strike damage by 3/6/10%. There is now a 33/66/100% chance whenever you hit with Blood Strike or Pestilence that the Blood Rune will become a Death Rune when it activates.<br />

Shield of Righteousness: Now deals 100% of shield block value as damage instead of 130%. In addition, the benefit from additional block value this ability gains is now subject to diminishing returns. Diminishing returns occur once block value exceeds 30 times the player's level and caps the maximum damage benefit from shield block value at 34.5 times the player's level.<br />

Earth Shock: Redesigned. This spell no longer interrupts spell casting, but rather reduces melee attack speed by 10% for 8 seconds (exclusive with similar effects such as Thunder Clap).<br />
Wind Shock: Has been renamed Wind Shear and no longer shares a cooldown with Flame, Frost or Earth Shock.<br />
Maelstrom Weapon: Now also has a chance to reduce the cast time of Hex.<br />
<br />

<br />
Engineering<br />
Flying Machine: The level requirement needed to learn how to build and use this machine has been reduced to level 60, down from level 70, and the engineering skill level reduced to 300, down from 350. Material costs reduced.<br />
<br />
Items<br />
Tome of Cold Weather Flying: New heirloom item. Players who have reached level 80 can now purchase this book for 1,000 gold from Hira Snowdawn, the Cold Weather Flying Trainer in Dalaran. Similar to other heirloom items, this item can be mailed to other characters of the same realm, account and faction. The book is consumed when read training the character in Cold Weather Flying. Requires level 68. <br />
Val'anyr, Hammer of Ancient Kings: This item's stats and level have been increased to match the power level of healer weapons coming from the Coliseum 25-person normal difficulty instance. In addition, each time Val'anyr is equipped, Blessing of Ancient Kings will be placed on a 45-second cooldown before it can occur.<br />
<br />
Isle of Conquest Changes - 07.10<br />
The following changes have been made to Isle of Conquest. Some of these changes may appear in the build going live today, while others might not make it in until the next build.<br />
<br />
Added a new powerful AoE attack to the Generals.<br />
Added bonus honor for destroying a gate (note: this honor is only given out once when the first gate is destroyed. Destroying additional gates does not grant additional honor).<br />
Increased the range of the Flame Turrets on the Siege Engines.<br />
Decreased the starting reinforcement count from 400 to 300.<br />
Achievements for the zone should all work correctly now.<br />
Fixed a bug that could cause the Keep Cannons to be unable to be repaired and despawn.<br />
Fixed a bug that was causing the alliance gate to not have collision at the start<br />
Lowered the movement speed of the glaive thrower (again).</div></div><hr />

Edit: Wah, wah chill down girls. My bad. I totally forgot about this &quot;wind shock&quot; spell. (meh, now everybody knows, that I haven't touched my shaman once since LK came out.)

<br />
They're buffing us by keeping Wind Shear as an Interrupt / Aggro Reduction, but taking it off Shock CD.<br />
Sounds like a buff to me!</div></div><hr />

<br />
exactly.<br />
i was so happy when i read the frist change, but the second one brought me back to earth.<br />

Nope, the BV contribution has DR beginning at 2400 BV, and it's capped at 2760.<br />
<br />

I'm pretty sure you read that wrong lol. Look at wind shear. They just took the interrupt away from earth shock but wind shear no longer shares a cd with the shocks. Sounds like a buff.</div></div><hr />

This (frost over earth shock) would be true for PvP, but Earth Shock is a staple of the PvE enhancement shaman 'rotation' (more a priority system, but anyway). Earth Shock is also our main interrupt. We Shaman have been asking for Wind Shock to come off the shock CD for awhile, but they couldn't do that and leave ES as an interrupt (imba for PvP). However, they didn't want to take away the interrupt benefit of ES from PvErs without giving back something (my guess, anyway).<br />
<br />
Overall, these changes (including MW'ed insta-hex) look like a pretty decent PvP buff, and maybe a slight PvE buff as well. Thanks Blizz!</div></div><hr />

It's that &quot;bring the player, not the class&quot; BS again, like if you'll ever end up in a raid without a warrior, you'll still get that imba &quot;10% reduced atk speed&quot; thingie.<br />

Why? I don't know about you, but for what I tested in ptr, at least in PvP, he are fine...<br />
For PvE only tried 10 man dps check, on 1º place. Still, need to test whit ppl I know that have skill :)<br />

<br />
Being able to Frost Shock without having to worry about your only interrupt being on CD is a pretty big buff, and you're right about enhancement not speccing into Reverberation. As far as PvP buffs to enh being 'un-needed', I would disagree, and I think that Arena representation would support this (pretty common) PoV.</div></div><hr />

Hehe true, and rogues dont need any major changes. We're pretty balanced/fine as it is atm.<br />

They can't directly change your playstyle while maintaining you 100% at the level you are, the changes would inevitably result in a buff or a nerf and seeing where Rogues are it would be a nerf.<br />
<br />
Stop asking for changes, it wont result in anything but a nerf and if you think otherwise you are fooling yourself. Also, Stealth, Evasion, Vanish, Cloak of Shadows, Cheat Death and Dismantle and sprint don't help you survive at all. (Only the last two are even that situational.<br />

I have to agree, can't really see what could be changed on rogues other than nerfing the class.<br />

Beginning with season 7, players will no longer have access to the newest season's weapons or shoulder armor and will not qualify for the Gladiator title/rewards with ratings from the 2v2 bracket alone. Ratings obtained through 3v3 and 5v5 game play will be required for these rewards, while the rest of the newest season's items will remain available to players in all brackets (standard rating restrictions still apply).<br />
<br />
Items: General<br />
Resilience: No longer reduces the amount of damage done by damage-over-time spells, but instead reduces the amount of all damage done by players by the same proportion. In addition, the amount of resilience needed to reduce critical strike chance, critical strike damage and overall damage has been increased by 15%.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Uhm o.O What the fuck?<br />
I just checked the stats on the items of this season. As a warrior you can get up to ca. 10% damage reduction from everything with this change of resilience. This means if you are tank skilled and in defstance you get up to 82% physical damage reduction and 36k life unbuffed. This just makes you the best tankingclass in the game WHILE WEARING PVP GEAR -&gt; in PvP.<br />
I just saw that it only goes for incoming playerdamage - not monster damage. But still in PvP 82% phys damage reduction.</div></div><hr />

<br />
True story, I always feel crippled having to reduce my dps (skipping Earth Shock when it's up) just because I have to interrupt something. Good changes, but the Maelstrom Weapon &quot;buff&quot; probably won't do jack, I don't see why hex isn't already instant or at least has a much lower CD.</div></div><hr />

What are you talking about? Cold Weather Flying isn't Artisan Flying. ;) All the tome does is make it possible for an alt to fly in Northrend at 68 instead of 77, provided you have a level 80 char who can buy the tome and mail it to said alt. He'll still need to have learned either Journeyman (600 G -faction discount) or Artisan Flying (5k G -faction discount) to be able to fly at all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. I guess passive physical damage reduction is still capped at 75%<br />
2. GL tanking in PVP gear. 20% avoidance and 15% block vs boss. Even 60k wont help you.</div></div><hr />

Wind Shock: Has been renamed Wind Shear and no longer shares a cooldown with Flame, Frost or Earth Shock.<br />

It's a desease that a lot of shamans have, we they see a 'change' they automatically see 'nerf'. But this is a buff, now we have a nice anti melée spell and have an interupt that no longer causes a loss to dps as it is off the shock gcd. If I remember correctly wind shock/shear was off the standard gcd. So now we can wind shear+shock in 1 gcd?</div></div><hr />

They say they wanted sword and board to use block, yet they nerf shield of righteousness by 30% and then provide a limit of how much block value can be applied to it. Blizz is saying one thing and doing the opposite. <br />
<br />
I might be missing something, but in order to make block value a useful stat against raid boss hits there certainly can't be limits on block value or diminishing returns.</div></div><hr />

10% Slower attack speed(pvp) isnt that great imo :/ but still its nice that we get new Windshock to interrupt spells with, and we can focus shocks to deal damage instead.<br />

I am not sure if i am reading this correctly. Correct me if i am wrong, but to get s7 shoulders and weapons you must have the ratings in both 3v3 and 5v5?</div></div><hr />
