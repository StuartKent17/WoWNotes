Patch 4.0.6 - PTR Build 13561<br />
A new PTR build will be deployed on test realms, most of these changes are probably already in the official notes but I'm sure there are a couple of new things too. <br />
<br />
Important - For the first time in history, I decided to stop being stupid! Datamined info is now placed in MMO Champion quotes to help differentiate datamining from official information, and it only took me 4 years to do that! Feedback appreciated in comments.<br />

in other news: still fuming over them increasing the energy penalty on blade flurry. I was really hoping the buff to its duration would actually make us semi-decent at fights with adds where you swap around targets. <br />

I'm guessing they hotfixed it so it wouldn't be so unbearably unbalanced at level 85. Having a full 30 seconds of stun and snare immunity would be quite ridiculous. The patch change is likely how they are going to balance it and allow its use again at 85.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't think you understand the difference between unique and unique-equipped.<br />
<br />
Unique means &quot;You can only have one copy of a unique item in all of your inventory, including what you have in the bank. If you have an opportunity to acquire another of the same item then you will be unable to. For example, if a mob drops the same item that you already possess, you won't be able to loot the item.&quot; (from wowpedia)<br />
<br />
Unique-equipped means &quot;...you can have only one of those items equipped at any one time. You can have as many as you see fit in your inventory, but only one actually equipped to one of your slots&quot; (also wowpedia)<br />
<br />
As I already described, this is a nice change for those of us who can dual-spec into a different role that would use a completely different trinket (say balance to feral).</div></div><hr />

Loving the green text. Not only is it nice to have the difference (although unless you had some kind of reading disabiliy you already should have been noticing the difference :P). I also think the green on black text is MUCH easier to the eyes than the blue on black.<br />

It was my understanding that these items are under a different name, and they are not affected by the others unique tag, considering they aren't the same item. In this case, the change would have no affect.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hey, I wouldn't mind 90k crits if I didn't die from pulling threat immediately after them :P<br />
<br />
Being a Shadow Priest is the most unrewarding caster for large crits. I'm so tired of being an expansion behind. Now I hear &quot;Omg, I critted for 35K!&quot; Then Mind Blast crits for like 16K...Which was cool...In like WoTLK. In WoTLK, it was the same thing. We were doing &quot;BC crits&quot;.<br />
<br />
Now I know Shadow Priests aren't like the other casters...But at least give me one spell that I can get excited about critting. That's all I want! Nerf the other stuff if you have to- as long as it's balanced. <br />
<br />
Sometimes, I need to feel special about my crits too.</div></div><hr />

Yet another doubling of gold from their first incarnations? Yes please. <br />

With awesome changes like this coming for Archaeology, it's starting to not be the worst profession and waste of time in the game.</div></div><hr />

i know its just me picking at it but you should write it like this 30-(8*3)=6 as its not wrong to go 30-8*3=66 depending how you where taught to do math just saying i know its commonly recognised as the answer is 6 but writing it properly is good can also write like this 30-3(8)=6</div></div><hr />

<br />
The front page's tooltips aren't showing it, but the stones are now &quot;Unique: Alchemist Stone (1)&quot; (which is actually a step above Unique-Equipped, honestly).<br />
<br />
This is to prevent people from using two different Alchemist Stones, like the Stamina one and the Agility one for a tank or something.<br />

It just says &quot;Unique&quot; for me, but if you click on it, you can see the change - it's now: &quot;Unique: Alchemist Stone (1)&quot; instead of &quot;Unique&quot; like it is on Live.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not like its gonna matter that much, i atm have plenty of mana left on every single raid boss. I can live without some more. The problem is not the healing made, the problems are players taking to much dmg, not moving fast enough, not focused, etc.<br />
<br />
But well always players who whine about nerfs, instead of just trying to improve how they heal.<br />

I don't know about the Alchemist trinkets not being unique. Are they at least unique-equipped? That'd be pretty OP if an alchy could just pop on 2 359 ilvl trinkets with great stats right at 80. Those trinkets are extremely powerful for some people.<br />
<br />
As you can see in the Tooltip, u can only have one Alchemist Stone equipped. And i u feel they are powerfull, reroll alchemist, instead of whining.</div></div><hr />
