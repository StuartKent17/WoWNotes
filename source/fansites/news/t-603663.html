New PTR Build<br />
A new build has been deployed on the PTR, nothing really new here because most of the changes were already in last week's patch notes update.<br />
Mages<br />
The mana gems min and max mana value have been modified slightly to provide a less random bonus to the mana.<br />
Rank 1 - Restores 390 to 410 mana. (Instead of 375-425)<br />
Rank 2 - Restores 585 to 615 mana. (Instead of 550 to 650)<br />
Rank 3 - Restores 829 to 871 mana. (Instead of 775 to 925)<br />
Rank 4 - Restores 1073 to 1127 mana. (Instead of 1000 to 1200)<br />
Rank 5 - Restores 2340 to 2460 mana. (Instead of 1800 to 3000 on PTR, 1136 - 1364 on live)<br />
Icy Veins now increases the chance your chilling effects will freeze the target by 10% (was 25%). 20% reduced cast time on all spells remains unchanged. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Rogues<br />
Hemorrhage now deals 110% Weapon damage instead of 125%, bonus damage from the debuff is slightly increased (lasts 10 charges or 15 seconds).<br />
Rank 1 - 110% weapon damage, increases any Physical damage dealt to the target by up to 13.<br />
Rank 2 - 110% weapon damage, increases any Physical damage dealt to the target by up to 21.<br />
Rank 3 - 110% weapon damage, increases any Physical damage dealt to the target by up to 29.<br />
Rank 4 - 110% weapon damage, increases any Physical damage dealt to the target by up to 42.<br />
Shadowstep now awards one combo point. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Other classes<br />

Season 2 Titles &amp; Mounts<br />
A lot of people have been waiting for an official post about this, yup season 2 rewards are still bugged for some players all over the world, and they're aware of the issue.<br />
The investigation into the incorrect awarding of Season 2 titles and mounts is still ongoing across all regions (Europe, the US and Korea).<br />
<br />
Though we are aware of your concerns over the delay to resolving this issue, due to the scale and intricacies involved implementing a full solution requires further time and attention. We ask for your patience while the investigation continues, and assure you that it is still a top priority.<br />
<br />

Hemorrhage is being changed because frontload damages were too high, more group utility is being added instead. (Increased damage from debuff) (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=3271118469&amp;postId=32341764696&amp;sid=1#4))<br />

Doomguard and Infernal pets will be improved at some point in the future, quite possibly in Wrath of the Lich King. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=3271119029&amp;postId=32344970719&amp;sid=1#10))<br />

PvP<br />
Blizzard is definitely aware of the concern and wait times (especially in 2vs2 arena) as they stand, and are looking into what our options are to help. However, it won't be done immediately because the devs are waiting to see the broader pidcutres, outside of the 2.3/S3/Holidays playing spike. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=3271177255&amp;postId=32344969837&amp;sid=1#8))<br />
Developpers are aware that players want the ability to join AV as a group, but they're being careful about how this could affect the queue times and they didn't make any final decision yet.

Wrath of the Lich King<br />
You shouldn't see any &quot;old&quot; faction providing rewards in Wrath of the Lich King. From a design philosophy Blizzard prefers to NOT give more experienced players a distinct advantage over new ones. Based on this example the Argent Dawn faction will probably not be re-used for Northrend.

The respawns of gas clouds are confirmed to not work properly for the moment, it will be fixed in 2.3.2. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=3168509508&amp;postId=32358271391&amp;sid=1#31))<br />

Oceanic servers - Internode WoW Gateway trial<br />
Australian players are lagging, this isn't new. Good news for players using Internode, a temporary fix has been published and seems to works well for most of the players. (Ping lowered from 450ms to 250ms)<br />
<br />
- You can check the Howto on Internode forums (http://games.internode.on.net/forums/viewtopic.php?t=132915)<br />
- There are also a lot of feedback posts on Whirlpool.net.au forums (http://forums.whirlpool.net.au/forum-replies.cfm?t=872425&amp;p=1), as well as a few Internode representatives posting here. (Like this post from Simon Hackett (http://forums.whirlpool.net.au/forum-replies.cfm?t=872425#r14) giving some details about it)<br />
<br />
Keep in mind that this isn't an official fix from Blizzard, and you should read both posts carefully before using it.</div></div><hr />

What rewards are you speaking about?<br />
<br />
If you are referring to the title that sure will improve your arena skill<br />

The netherdrake will surely make you go faster :-X</div></div><hr />
