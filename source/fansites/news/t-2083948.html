Unholy Death Knight Hidden Artifact Appearance<br />
d00mgiv3r found (http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/2059751-Death-Knight-Artifact-Weapon-Skins-How-to-get-them-(READ-OP)?p=42639796&amp;viewfull=1#post42639796) the Unholy Hidden Artifact earlier tonight, but the trigger to obtaining it isn't yet clear. <br />
<br />
<br />
Artifact Knowledge 6 was obtained by d00mgiv3r.<br />
Something triggered Putricide's Journal Area Trigger (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/221195-putricides-journal-area-trigger) and caused Professor Putricide's Lost Journal to spawn during a fight with the second boss in Court of Stars, but this may be unrelated. <br />
The book allows you to see a trap door in Professor Putricide (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/36678-professor-putricide)'s room in Icecrown Citadel.<br />
In the hidden chamber is the Stitchwork that drops The Bonereaper's Hook (http://www.wowdb.com/items/139548-the-bonereapers-hook)<br />
There is a hidden tracking achievement that may be releated: Hidden Tracking - Apocalypse Ghouls Summoned - Number of Ghouls Summoned by Unholy DK Artifact<br />
Research is ongoing in the thread on the forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/2059751-Death-Knight-Artifact-Weapon-Skins-How-to-get-them-(READ-OP)/page251?p=42639796#post42639796).<br />

<br />
Shield Slam now generates 20 Rage (was 10).<br />
 Ignore Pain’s maximum absorption has been reduced by 33%.<br />
Inspiring Presence no longer stacks on players who have multiple Warriors present.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Dungeons and Raids<br />
(All dungeon and raid hotfixes will take effect with realm restarts in each region.)<br />
<br />
<br />
Black Rook Hold<br />
<br />
Mythic Keystone target time increased to 38 minutes (was 35 minutes).<br />
<br />
Eye of Azshara<br />
<br />
Mythic Keystone target time decreased to 35 minutes (was 36 minutes).<br />
<br />
Maw of Souls<br />
<br />
Mythic Keystone target time decreased to 24 minutes (was 25 minutes).<br />
<br />
Neltharion’s Lair<br />
<br />
Mythic Keystone target time decreased to 33 minutes (was 35 minutes).<br />
<br />
Emerald Nightmare<br />
<br />
Vantus Runes can now be used in Mythic Emerald Nightmare.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Il’gynoth<br />
<br />
On Mythic difficulty, Il’gynoth’s health has been increased by 200%, but loses one-third of that value each time the Eye of Il’gynoth is defeated.<br />
On Mythic difficulty, each Nightmare Explosion now deals 20% more damage to the Eye of Il’gynoth.<br />
<br />
Developers’ Notes: A common strategy for Mythic Il’gynoth involved using raid compositions that focus on maximizing burst damage to complete the encounter in a single phase. This approach removes huge portions of the encounter and can overly favor a specific set of classes and specializations, causing negative social pressures in groups that have yet to reach this encounter. These changes ensure that raid groups must enter Il’gynoth’s core twice in order to complete the encounter on Mythic difficulty, but offset that change by speeding up the process of destroying the Eye to shorten the overall length of the encounter.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Professions<br />
<br />
Enchanting<br />
<br />
Crafted items that upgrade to epic quality should now disenchant into Leylight Shards or Chaos Crystals.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
<br />
Shaman Totems will no longer take unintended extra damage from players.<br />
<br />
<br />
Quests<br />
<br />
Players are now able to turn in &quot;Ritual Ruination&quot; to Calydus in Dreadscar Rift if they don’t take the portal out of the scenario.<br />

Once again, thanks for the thoughts and feedback on Fury. We are still in the processing of discussing all the feedback we've received, so I don't have any updates to share at this time.<br />

Oh i felt so bad for you last expansion. Brewmasters were so weak they had to use 2 1 handers in mythic raids to keep up with the damage of their DPS while pushing 0 buttons cause they had an insane amount of mastery... And warriors where so OP blizzard decided that they didnt need any absorbs or magic damage reductions, no self healing.<br />
Ok enaugh sarcasam. I can agree brewmasters are very awkward right now, but can't say for certain cause I don't play one. All I can say is that they were suppose to be that dodge and kite tank but ended up being a Guardian druid on steroids, pain killers and LSD given decent gear for the content they tanked. They pushed them back to their original fantasy but felt it was awkward to do that since DH is the new dodge and kite for your life fantasy tank. I hope they find a better place for the spec. Currently they have some reduction, some mobility, some self healing. Jack of all trades or masters of nothing. But no need to compare. Warrior needed something to make him comparable to other tanks like the DK and Druid.</div></div><hr />

Boo fucking hoo. I'm neither a Monk nor a Warrior, but Ignore Pain is not an absorb (as it takes 90%, not 100%). Guard is bad, and the rest of BrM's repertoire is balanced around not having it (obviously). Stop being autistic and adapt to change.<br />
<br />
Also, a lot of anger in your post, maybe dismantle your computer and sign yourself up for therapy.<br />

&quot;Definitely not.&quot;<br />
<br />
This line is complete and total bullshit. For one, the first part of Pathfinder requires you to finish &quot;Good Suramaritan&quot;, in which one of the requirements to complete that achievement is to go into the Emerald Dream and get an item off a boss, in particular Xavius, completely opposite of what the Blue's reply was. Really wish they wouldn't lie to our faces like this...</div></div><hr />

You don't need to raid for that achievement, that quest line doesn't even leave Suramar. But even if you did, the question was regarding &quot;organized&quot; raids, and I suspect the quest you're referring to can be completed in LFR once that wing opens up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, to my knowledge, LFR is a Raid is it not? It may be stretching the word &quot;organized&quot; but it is still an organized raid, thus gating Pathfider by a raid(s). This is just what we know of as well. Also, yes...you do need to raid for that Achievement, as it specifically says you have to kill Xavius and get an item from the Raid instance. Regardless, you have to raid to get those items to complete Pathfinder, and to a lesser extent, Good Suramartin.</div></div><hr />

While i do agree that pathfinder shouldent be gated behinde LFR, i will say that LFR is not raiding. Its netflix´n chill.</div></div><hr />

Yup this one just nailed me pretty hard. I wasn't even going crazy making gold with it but using crafted epics to provide enough Chaos Crystals for my friends and I to enchant our gear. Chaos Crystals already have risen over 500g in price since the hotfix went live on my realm. That hotfix really makes those mats even more of a pain in the ass to get.</div></div><hr />

The question in the tweet was about organised raiding. LFR is not organised as you can simply queue for it and be done.</div></div><hr />

Well LFR is a ''raid'' technically but you can queue and wait while doing some other quests, enter automatically, afk for 5 min and loot the boss after. Then you re done. <br />
Not ideal for the other ppl that actually killed it but you could do it if you don't want to press any buttons and play the actual game</div></div><hr />

For comparison, Guard only absorbs 480k on a 15 second cooldown... I have no sympathy for warriors getting nerfed, if anything I wish it was more. <br />

There is no debate and you definitely did not /end it with your comment.<br />
<br />
By your very definition of LFR, it DOES include some organization (&quot;form of raiding that requires least organization&quot;) and is therefore to be included in organized raiding.<br />
<br />
Some bosses do require communication, organization and coordination to down successfully, especially on first attempt.<br />

Most raiders in WOW raid LFR exclusively.</div></div><hr />

The questline can't be completed in LFR so the Good Suramaritan achievement is gated behind a raid. Good luck finding a group since people are dicks and expect to be carried since they require stupid high ilvls.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Good Suramaritan can most certainly be completed in LFR, the only questline that can't is the questline for your third artifact appearance.<br />
<br />
It just can't be completed yet since Xavius isn't available yet.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why does Blizzard want raiding to cost like 100k/week. Flask are expensive, tho you don't need many of them. Pots are way too expensive (800g each on my server), you can easily use over 20 pots on progress night. And now they fuck up this disenchanting, Chaos Crystal already get from 1k to 2k on my server and this is first day after hotfix. Neck enchant went from 12k to 24k. Cloak enchant went from 10k to 20k, for 50 increase on main stat.</div></div><hr />
