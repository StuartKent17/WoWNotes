Unfortunately if it were a hardware shortage, it would be a lot easier to fix. Blizzard has enough money to buy tons and tons of servers. But there are a lot of limitations when it comes to enterprise scale load problems. You can't just throw money at it and hope it fixes. :P</div></div><hr />

I actually have an iPod and have no problems using any Apple product. I just laugh at iTards like one of my cousins who thinks Microsoft products are completely unstable but Apple could do no wrong. You see this snobbish air of superiority all the time in various forums around the net from Apple computer users.<br />
<br />
Products like the iPod and iPhone are clearly the best in their category and people use it because they are cool and they work well. However, I suspect that most people using Apple desktops and laptops use it just for the snob factor. I just don't like the general attitude of Apple desktop/laptop users. Most think they're better humans than PC users.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
The positioning problem maybe, but for tanks that have AoE threat problems already (ie. druids and warriors), it can be an issue for everyone. With shockwave requiring the mobs to be in an arc in front, and I'm pretty sure swipe (?? never played a druid tank) requires the mobs to be in front as well.<br />
<br />
Where as a pallie can drop a cons, then just rely on the reflective damage, and a DK can DnD, then DoT everything up...<br />
<br />
But in saying that, I had an arms warrior die 5 times in one H PoS with a pallie tank. I think he just liked to OA.... Me and the healer made it a game to see who could res him the fastest. :)</div></div><hr />

I do both (endgame on a mac). It was very difficult to play end game content without my mousewheel responding as I expected it to. For some people, the bugs made the game basically unplayable, which is slightly more problematic than the subjective problem of &quot;catering to casuals&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
well actually in this case it should be fixable with more hardware (if they've done it right - which i'm sure they did) and there's no way they are already at the limit. that's the beauty of instancing. and i'm pretty sure they'll fix it in a short amount of time if needed.<br />
<br />
but i'm pretty sure they'll wait and see, since the load will go down naturally as soon as ppl got all their emblem gear or get bored from doing the same heroics over and over again. that's much cheaper.</div></div><hr />

One thing is what a player does inside the game, end game or not.<br />

Another thing is that I have been the whole week with the game not working how it should be. And of course, I'm paying for it.<br />

I have a macbook (and yes, an iPod) and I bought it because I am more comfortable with the unix-style OS as I use solaris servers at work all the time. Furthermore, I am a photographer and a mac suits my needs better than a windows based system. What I like in my mac is just the ease of use, as I dont need to care about maintaining the system - most is done automatically and I am quite lazy :) I dont say macs are superior, but for me they are more suitable, and I am kind of sad that most windows users keep flaming apple users.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Apple users flame Windows users just as much. It goes both ways :)<br />
<br />
As a graphic and web interface designer/developer, I've always been more Windows based. Not by choice really, that's just the systems the company I work for uses (not primarily a graphic/web design company). <br />
<br />
I'd love to get familiar with a Mac but for one, it would hamper productivity at work trying to learn an OS I know very little about, and I'm reluctant to spend the money on a system for home just so I have a slightly more optimized environment (I personally don't believe Mac's are vastly superior anymore in regards to the graphics industry. Imo, that's nothing more than an antiquated perception based on old bus sizes and memory capabilities at the time. Now a days, there is very little difference aside from comfort in your computing environment)</div></div><hr />

<br />
The iPhone has a stranglehold on the hip smartphone market, yes. The iPod, on the other hand, has had better alternatives for a long time. Apple markets well, and so the iPod continues to win out.<br />
<br />
When it comes to computers, the primary deciding factor should be: What are you used to? Used to using PCs since you were in school? Get a PC. Macs? Get a Mac. No issue. I've had a lot more people look down on me because I use Windows and PCs than the other way around. As someone who builds his own computers, purchasing an Apple computer seems like a completely foreign idea to me. For other people, a Mac makes perfect sense. <br />
<br />
The thing that gets me is that the fight exists in the first place and that people feel required to defend/contest their choice of operating system/hardware. It's fueled (in my opinion) by Apple's constant needling at Microsoft. Admittedly, some (and perhaps even a majority) of the &quot;Mac vs. PC&quot; commercials are funny and/or true. Some of them, however, are straight-up lies and really shouldn't be considered anything but false marketing. Omission is one thing, amplifying a false sense of safety is another thing, but outright lying about yourself or the competition is really bad form. The same thing drives me nuts about car commercials and political campaign commercials. Just sell your product on what your product can do, not because the other guy sucks worse.</div></div><hr />
