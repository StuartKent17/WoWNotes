Well that’s nice I guess, what about all the other categories?<br />
This is just what we have confirmed so far. There could potentially be more added to the list, but I personally just don’t know of any others yet.<br />

We’d love to hear from you guys on more examples of abilities that you feel should be off the GCD and why. (Source (https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/37795/17))</div></div><hr />

Are you serious? One of the biggest problems with devs these days is their refusal to own up to their mistakes. Bethesda is the perfect example, when this whole bag mess started the first thing you get out of their customer service was &quot;The prototype bags were too expensive, we aren't going to do anything about it&quot;. Not at all surprising that the shitstorm only got worse after that response. You know what calmed it down? &quot;We made a mistake and we are going to make it right&quot;</div></div><hr />

They are their own worst enemy. I agree that having one macro with 4 different CD’s can seem a bit wierd on paper but in reality it was never a probelm for any players so why start using a lot of ressources to change it. And also why make changes which make most of the players annoyed. I’m not saying they should spoil us and give in to everything.. but again.. pick your battles.</div></div><hr />

<br />
never said they dont make mistakes<br />
<br />
all I said is they're not afraid to admit making them.<br />
<br />
remember flares in delve? less then 1 week in they said &quot;sorry guys we fucked up, we fixed flares now&quot; a change like that would take blizzard 3 months<br />
<br />
also they nerfed zerphi's which by proxy nerfs poet's pen<br />
<br />
BV also got nerfed indirectly(statstick nerf+inpulsa nerf)<br />
<br />
and 2hs are getting buffs thanks to the new insane 2h metacrafting options.<br />
<br />
and statsticks WERE broken, dont get me wrong I dont like how they nerfed them at all, but they needed to be nerfed.<br />
<br />
but hey.<br />
<br />
they also said they're gonna fix selfcast in 3.6 and apologized for not having time to do it in 3.5, but they did rework quite a few spells and added new ones which look like will work well for selfcast.<br />
<br />
also, if you think melee is gonna be bad: https://pathofexile.gamepedia.com/Paradoxica?fbclid=IwAR0oy-Qu9Y2vzd4W8knjQFTdCdcHsT5KkH6u4lhVJgxrguM0b6ikCkoPo78<br />

GCD's serve a very important purpose. It allows the developers to balance your power spikes appropriately, while also giving targets time to react.

<br />
Some gcd changes are alright and I see what Blizz was going for. The removal of “pop everything all at once” style. The issue stems that they went a little overboard in some cases. Putting movement abilities all across the board as well as all defensive and offensive abilities on the gcd hurt a lot of what people like.<br />
Something they could have tried is what they do with trinkets. If a person pops an offensive cd, all other offensive CDs are put on a 1.5 gcd but not normal abilities. Just as a for instance, Hunters could use BW and immediately press any other button except AotW. So BW could be immediately followed by KC, or you could use AotW and immediately use KC, but you have to wait from using BW and AotW at the same time. It’s possibly not the best idea, but it follows Blizz’s want of removing the pop everything gameplay while adding a slight bit of depth and intricacy for min maxing your playstyle. Or a warrior could hit any ability and still have there shout available, and vice versa; but if they use shout then their other defensive ability has a 1.5 second gcd, but not the offensive abilities.<br />
Or, they could have added a 1.5 second duration to all abilities so you don’t miss out on that time of abilities not getting the full duration effect.</div></div><hr />

<br />
GCD in PVP is NOT so important that if it drives enough players away from PVE gameplay that they won't revert it or restrict it to PVP. I don't give two shits how fast you are killing people in PVP and neither do the massively high % of players who don't touch PVP.<br />
<br />
I understand your reasoning, but I see it everywhere where people are figuring out that a lot of the reason BfA is seen so negatively comes down to clunky gameplay because of the GCD and ability pruning affects every aspect of the game. Other things you don't like you can get away from by not doing. If gameplay is broken the rest of the systems are going to be perceived as worse than they are because of it.</div></div><hr />

So when a person disagree with you, you just tend to call them ignorant or &quot;buttmad&quot; seems rather childish. Are you one of those people that kick and scream like a 5 year old when you don't get what you want or when someone disagrees with you? <br />
<br />
GCD may hurt some that plays outdoor pvp but public outcries about the game play in both instanced pvp and pve are also voicing concerns about their classes feeling clunky to play and in certain cases even not fun anymore. Also with the previous state of GCD you had plenty of time to react in instanced pvp if you knew what class you were facing and could counter it with defensives etc. Also are you referring to the trinket Draught of souls as an argument and i guess you only used it in outdoors pvp?</div></div><hr />

A bunch of people on the forums would spam &quot;BLIZZARD ADMITS THEY WERE WRONG. DAMN THEIR GAME IS SHIT&quot; and find something else they think is broken to bitch about. It's not like 99% of posts are constructive and valuable feedback. People can call the game &quot;Beta for Azeroth&quot; all day long, but if they didn't implement new things and try new mechanics/designs, we'd all still be playing vanilla wow with MC and Onxyia.<br />

Maybe they can &quot;fix&quot; my destro lock so I can cast while moving.<br />
<br />
I mean, if people can whine about neighbor having a better job and makes more money and life isn't fair. Its just sad that people have to complain about everything :D. <br />

I like/dislike bfa, but still play it.</div></div><hr />

Reverting shit change piece by piece over the course of the whole expansion - adjusting gameplay according to player feedback.<br />

I'm sure glad to be a part of this experiment.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As a Warrior I used to pop all of my cool downs, and then Draught and SLAUGHTER people around me in less than 1.5 seconds. It was IMPOSSIBLE to reach to me unloading a full bore Draught on you.<br />
<br />
GCD's serve a very important purpose. It allows the developers to balance your power spikes appropriately, while also giving targets time to react. I get that you're ignorant to how development and balancing works, but PvP has never been better with the GCD changes. Don't be buttmad when you're ignorant.<br />
<br />
But you gotta admit ignore pain on GCD was idiotic at least xd</div></div><hr />

<br />
For boomies at least it means I can jump back immediately during the GCD of my instants to get out of something right away instead of 1.5 seconds later after I've already taken a tick or two of whatever bad thing I've been standing it or hit by whatever ability I should've sidestepped.</div></div><hr />
