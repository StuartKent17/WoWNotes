A new drop location has been added to the mounts list. The Green Proto-Drake is actually a (very?) rare drop from the Mysterious Egg rewarded by The Oracles in Sholazar Basin.

WotLK Quests - Monsters Drop<br />
Ever wondered why you can't get the quest achievement for a zone in WotLK? It might be because you missed a quest dropped by a monster (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=833)! I did most of this list during the beta but I don't think anything changed in the live version of the game. (Note: The tooltips won't work for quests with multiple quests/items depending on faction) <br />

Thanksgiving also means slow news day. Hopefully I've got a few more WotLK pages almost completed and you shouldn't even feel bored in the next days.<br />

Spirit Beasts and additional pets<br />
We wanted to have a difficult to get pet for those hunters who enjoyed the challenge of it in the old days. We wanted to make sure the Spirit Beast was not absolutely the best pet for that reason. We will probably add more over time. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/13129103918-blizz-loquenahakrepost-from-hunter-forum.html))<br />

Retribution nerf and PvP<br />
We said before that if toning down Ret burst made them no longer very good at Arenas that we would be willing to give them additional utility. We just don't think the proverbial writing on the wall is that clear yet. We'll know a lot more in a few weeks. (Source (http://))<br />

Mind Flay &quot;bug&quot;<br />
If I had any more information, I would give it. We changed the way Mind Flay worked, which introduced the problem you referenced. It is not technically a bug, but it's still annoying and we'd like to get it fixed. We're not sure if rebuilding the spell is the right answer or if there are other things we can do.<br />
<br />
It is going to be really hard for me to continually repost on the same topics just to say &quot;We haven't forgotten.&quot; (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/13129904697-no-responses--frustrating.html))<br />

Sartharion + 3 Drakes by vodka<br />
I didn't post any raid video since the release of Wrath of the Lich King, mostly because the starting raid content isn't as hard as what we experienced in The Burning Crusade. Let's try to fix this today with a video of Sartharion + 3 Drakes (http://www.vodka-guild.com/) by vodka (http://www.vodka-guild.net/) (Shaman PoV)! <br />

<br />
Yep, here's how you do it:<br />
<br />
Go to the cave and battle the Lich again,<br />
then kill the Frenzyheart-guy when you get the option,<br />
then kill the Lich and turn in the quest from the Oracle.<br />
<br />
You can do this once a day, and it brings you straight to Honored.</div></div><hr />

He was running to the safe areas trying to avoid the giant wall of fiery death that sweeps across the entire area &gt;.&gt;</div></div><hr />

If the drop is soooo rare, then its quite possible them wolves also have a rare mount.</div></div><hr />
