Battlefield: Barrens Ending Soon - Update<br />
Ok...so Gahzrookie, the gloves, and the bag will be around...but what about the troll shoes, Xan'tish's flute, and the other vanity items?<br />
Also, titles account-wide pretty please?<br />
Every item other than the pet, the Brawler's Guild item, and the 24-slot bag, and the ability to earn the title are being removed. We know a lot of you would like to have the cosmetic goodies readily available to pick up with other characters or to share with your alts, but this event was designed to be part of the story for the game at this point in time. For those who earned their title, you now carry a badge of honor for having helped the war effort against Garrosh.<br />
<br />
The weekly quest was designed as both--and most importantly--an event that leads up to Patch 5.4 and the Siege of Orgrimmar, and an opportunity for level 90 characters to work on getting gear a bit quicker in preparation for the new content. Now that the story of this expansion will be pressing forward with the patch, it will be time to wrap up some of the activity in Durotar and Northern Barrens. Think of the action in those areas as exclusive for where we are at this point in the game (not unlike the gathering quests for Ahn'Qiraj and the Scourge Event before Wrath of the Lich King).<br />
<br />
Crithto: I have an alt, a pally I am levelling. What I wanted to do was give her the tokens (she has them) then with the BOA mojo, send those to her so she had a 489 starter set.<br />
I was *really* hoping yall would at least consider making the radical mojo's BoA so that we could complete our sets at the very least.<br />
I would simply like to ask that you reconsider this. At least make the Radical Mojo BOA. Please.<br />
Please know that I completely understand how you guys are feeling about this and have several alts I've been working on, too. But let's not forget that the Radical Mojo clearly displays &quot;Binds when picked up&quot;. Simply switching it to BoA would be nice for those who have more than one unused, but it would be unfair to everyone else who did not stockpile a BoP item.<br />
<br />
For those seeking opportunities to provide your alts with gear, the Timeless Isle will be your new favorite place to visit. The tokens you can find there are BoA before being used, and can be passed to any of your alts to generate an item for his/her spec. The gear you create will be item-level 496, and as you progress through the Isle, you will also have the chance to upgrade them to item-level 535.<br />
<br />
Lastly, while Ravika has other important duties to attend to once 5.4 goes live, we know that Griftah's Authentic Troll Shoes hold a soft spot in many hearts, so weâ€™re currently exploring options to reintroduce them at a later date.<br />

Mastery Enchants on Characters Under Level 80<br />
We're actually modifying Windsong to not proc Mastery for players below level 80. It will always proc either Crit or Haste.<br />
<br />
For flat Mastery enchants... maybe don't put them on characters that don't have Mastery yet. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/267501-mastery-under-level-80/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/9793019310?page=2#22))<br />
<br />
Connected Realms and Faction Balance<br />
While faction balance is one of the factors that will be taken into account when deciding on which realms we will connect, we will most likely not see a perfect faction balance on the connected realms in the end. The reason for this is that the Alliance is generally the most popular faction on PvE realms, while it is the Horde that is the most popular on PvP realms... and we cannot connect PvE with PvP realms. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/267474-another-question-of-the-virtual-realms/) / Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/7960706205?page=2#22))<br />
<br />
Arena Pass Title and Pet<br />
The rated phase has ended, but the plan is to keep the realms up for a while. It is no longer possible to do games that count towards the pet or title. <br />
Just highlighting this to ensure that everyone is aware that the rated phase has now concluded. Any games that are played outside of the rated phase won't count towards the pet or title reward, so you can't gain credit towards either of these anymore. <br />
<br />
Just so you know though; the realm will be sticking around for a while yet, so you can definitely feel free to sign up and play some epic PvP action!

Patch 5.4 Elemental Shaman RNG<br />
Isnt half the problem the mastery duplicate coupled with haste induced ticks on their flame shock giving so many free instants? echo of elements was only half the issue. <br />
Several things compounded to create the complaints that we have been seeing for Elemental Shamans, Echo of Elements and Lava Surge procs as well as the mastery spell duplication were all parts of it. We nerfed Echo of Elements to take the edge off of extreme elemental burst situations and we will continue monitoring every class and make changes as we feel they are needed.<br />
<br />
RNG in PvP such as the procs listed above for Elemental Shamans is something that our developers are having ongoing discussions about. In the long run what we want to accomplish is to limit the excessive cases when and wherever possible, such as we did with Echo of Elements. The developers recognize and understand that some players would prefer there to be no randomness in PvP at all, but we don't feel that this would result in good gameplay overall.<br />
<br />
But there needs to be a limit to it, ele shamans right now aren't fun to play against. <br />
We entirely agree and this is the kind of RNG that we are referring to when I said &quot;excessive cases when and wherever possible&quot;. To try and combat that extreme and random burst that comes from Elemental Shamans we nerfed Echo of the Elements and feel that this should help deal with the the extreme cases of RNG for them. We will be keeping an eye on RNG in PvP and continue to discuss ways in which we can deal with any extreme cases that arise.

Chaos Bolt Buff<br />
We agree that Destruction is a bit low in 5.4. We also recognize that, particularly after the Kil'Jaeden's Cunning changes, Chaos Bolt has become a &quot;riskier&quot; spell to cast. To both ends, we think a Chaos Bolt buff is in order. We're going to bring it up by 15% and see where that puts things.<br />
<br />
Our general philosophy for Destruction in 5.4 is that casting Chaos Bolt can be tricky sometimes -- working around interrupts and LOS in PvP, or sneaking them in between periods of movement in PvE -- but when the cast goes off, it hurts. A lot. We do have to be careful not to push things TOO far, but we'll see how things go from here.<br />
<br />
This change was applied via hotfix sometime yesterday, so it should already be live on the PTR if you'd like to get some testing in.

I really don't care about numbers on any game, as long as I enjoy it, I may very well be the only player... But my personal experience with Guild Wars 2 is that everyone who bought it, stopped after the firs 2 weeks.<br />
I wanted it to be good, I really did but there were so many issues with it (like characters seeming floaty, on another layer than the world around them) that I simply couldn't play it. I also pre-ordered it, payed 65 euros online and after that my country got demoted to t2 and a boxed copy was 30 euros. Couldn't even get a refund for that &gt;&lt;.</div></div><hr />

We may never know how many got a refund out of the the iniatial 3M sales, to me it really doesn't matter anyway as the game isn't as packed as people say it is. Its still didn't live up to the hype to me, but for the people who enjoy a very casual thats there choice honestly.<br />

I actually think GW2 was one of the better non-WoW MMOs I've played, but it definitely had its issues. First and foremost for me I thought the gear path was vaguely defined. Also moving away from the holy trinity was a laudable goal but they kind of replaced it with nothing else, a lot of the dungeons felt like zergs, I didn't feel like I had a specific function (beyond &quot;hit stuff&quot;). Also being limited to 10 abilities made me feel crippled. It's nice to avoid button bloat but there was no wiggle room for situational abilities (tying ability sets to weapons was interesting though). Also WoW's combat has a nice move-countermove feeling to it, but with no trinkets and few proper stuns or crowd control, I often felt like I wasn't able to &quot;respond&quot; to anything, it was just a case of keep hitting until it dies. He's casting something? Can't do much (beyond dodging, which I kind of liked as a system). Pulled an add? Just have to hit them both.<br />
<br />
Oh this sounds very negative. But I've dabbled in a few other MMOs over the years and this one did pull me in for awhile.</div></div><hr />

It's just a bit too blurry on several aspects.<br />
Ex: You don't really get a feel of how to progress and get gear because the world is so open<br />
You don't get a good feel of how your spec is. There's no dps meters, no real way to gauge your contribution in a team. If I didn't play WoW for so long I wouldn't mind. But unfortunately, wow got me addicted to min/maxing :(</div></div><hr />

Thre are some aspects of the game that I liked like the envoroment, the graphics but the game fails horribly on gameplay: the skill sistem bound to the weapon is horrible and offers little customization/character planning and the game response to input is incredibly sloppy (in a game where to stay alive u have to dodge with perfect reaction....)<br />
I still consider GW1 way better because it had a great gameplay, this one seems a game for casuals to me.</div></div><hr />

They did make a huge mistake not bringing over the skill system from GW1. Hunting down various elite skills and building new skill templates was one of the best things in GW1.

First and foremost for me I thought the gear path was vaguely defined. Also moving away from the holy trinity was a laudable goal but they kind of replaced it with nothing else, a lot of the dungeons felt like zergs, I didn't feel like I had a specific function (beyond &quot;hit stuff&quot;). Also being limited to 10 abilities made me feel crippled. It's nice to avoid button bloat but there was no wiggle room for situational abilities (tying ability sets to weapons was interesting though). Also WoW's combat has a nice move-countermove feeling to it, but with no trinkets and few proper stuns or crowd control, I often felt like I wasn't able to &quot;respond&quot; to anything, it was just a case of keep hitting until it dies. He's casting something? Can't do much (beyond dodging, which I kind of liked as a system). Pulled an add? Just have to hit them both.<br />
<br />
Oh this sounds very negative. But I've dabbled in a few other MMOs over the years and this one did pull me in for awhile.<br />
<br />
I am not sure why the want to compare GW2 box sales to MMOs.. it is more appropriate to compare it to Diablo2. I mean, isnÂ´t it pretty obvious that less people are going to buy a box for $50 if they know it also requires $15 per month? But even still. GW2 sold less in a year, than MoP sold in 24 hours...<br />
<br />
About the holy trinity. Anyone who ever played UO, or any game without the trinity knows the difference. At best, you have dungeons and boss encounters that are like scenerios in WOW. The mechanisms of the fights have to be dumbed down greatly. Yes, if you are anti-wow, then it is easy to say Â´omg, it is great they donÂ´t have the trinityÂ´.. but in an actual game, it just does not have enough meat to make any time of meaningful endgame. Again, at best, you have scenarios.. which are fun, but definitely not as cray</div></div><hr />

This is the issue I have with other MMO's. I've tried Rift and Secret World and both games were really awesome, better than WoW but I quit playing because of this. It's amazing how such a little thing has a huge impact. Your character feeling rigid and floaty and not feeling like it's actually on the ground is very unnerving.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The reason why I hate Guild Wars 2 the most because they think 5 man dungeons in end game PvE content which it shouldn't be and they left out the most important system of all and that's the Trinity system. I enjoy being a tank, healer or dps in big groups of people.</div></div><hr />

Agreed. <br />
GW2 has a beautiful world to explore and it's a lot of fun while leveling. If you take the time to enjoy the scenery, I think a gamer gets more than the boxes price in entertainment.<br />
PvE Endgame however, can be ignored, due to the above.<br />
PvP, me has no clue about. :D</div></div><hr />

I wanted it to be good, I really did but there were so many issues with it (like characters seeming floaty, on another layer than the world around them) that I simply couldn't play it. I also pre-ordered it, payed 65 euros online and after that my country got demoted to t2 and a boxed copy was 30 euros. Couldn't even get a refund for that &gt;&lt;.<br />

It's been easier for me to do anything in WoW including heroic dungeons/raids than some of the stuff in Guild Wars 2. <br />
<br />
Yeah Mop sold so much because it was a new game with a new franchise right, right?, fucking idiot people talking on the website, why do i even bother replying to people that think WoW is still hard/good anyway. <br />
<br />
And mop losing 2 million players also talks it own language here. Have fun with your skinner box game though.</div></div><hr />

I didn't want to reply to a raging fanboy... but seriously, GW2 has been losing players since day 1, are you sure you want to compare this to an old game like wow with 4 expansions on its shoulders?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">puppypizza</div><div class="date">2013-08-30, 02:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Half of these numbers are made up. <br />
<br />
3.5 million shipped copies does not equal sold copies. Also their 400k, is the amount of people that log on within a 24 hour period.<br />
(400k per 24 hours is nothing for an mmo, if it really were that succesful it would be 3x as much).<br />
<br />
They didn't say shipped, they said sold. And the only numbers I could find for concurrent players in WoW are 800k for Burning Crusade's launch, and 1 million for MoP. They also used the &quot;highest concurrency&quot; caveat, which means it was only recorded at its highest peak.<br />
<br />
BC:<br />
800k / 11 million = 7.3% concurrency<br />
<br />
MoP:<br />
1 million / 10 million = 10% concurrency<br />
<br />
GW2:<br />
460k / 3.5 million = 13.1% concurrency<br />
<br />
So how are you measuring how &quot;successful&quot; GW2 is based on this number?<br />
<br />
<br />
GW2 sold less in a year, than MoP sold in 24 hours...<br />
<br />
The only sales numbers I could find for MoP were that it sold 2.4 million on the first day (2.7 million in the first week). GW2 has sold 3.5 million so far.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Awe</div><div class="date">2013-08-30, 02:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As someone who plays GW2 as his main MMO I should straighten up few things.

That being said, GW2 as &quot;fastest selling MMO&quot; is probably not a lie, just some facts bending. They still sold ***load of games in the first month or two. TBC or WOTLK probably sold faster, but you can bend it and claim those are expansions and not new MMO-s. So yeah, facts bending, thats all to it.<br />
<br />
Second thing. Yes, probably most of people who bought GW2 left it. Probably true. But to calling this game &quot;deader than dead&quot; is a fallacy on so many levels. People saying that GW2 is dead probably have no clue about what they talk about or didnt logged to it since months. The only time when I seen bigger masses of players in WoW was when expansions were launching. The only time when LA is not zerged is between 4 and 8 am. New meta events are always full of people and WvW is alive 24/7. The point is, GW2 feels actually more alive than WoW on most servers. Now sure, WoW has still more players, thats a fact. And it is also true that WoW has like x10 more servers which splits the population. If you ask me, Blizzard should cut the amount of servers they have by 50% and do some merges. I dont know how many people are playing GW2 right now but the game certainly feels very alive. It feels alive with 50 servers. Same as EVE Online feels alive with less than 500k subs (at least half of which are alt accounts) but since all people are packed on only one big server, it feels well alive. Which btw. is also a good news for all WoW fans becouse it means that even if WoW will loose 8 million subs, it will still be able to feel alive, all that Blizzard will have to do is to merge some servers or utilize more CRZ and this new connected realms tech.<br />
<br />
And last thing a bit more IMHO. I see some people saying that controls and feel of character in GW2 feels bad. Well, I know it is a subjective opinion and I cant deny that someone is not liking it. But for me GW2 is actually one of few MMO games which does the &quot;feel the character&quot; right. Most MMO I try, the control feels very choppy and that was one of the key reasons why I left those games. WoW was king in this aspect for years but GW2 is the game which finnally does it right for me. I would even say that I like GW2 feel of character more than the one from WoW. After playing GW2, it is the WoW system which feels more choppy for me (maybe its becouse of old models and the fact you can cast 99% of skills in GW2 while moving). That is of course all my opinion so I am not stating that as an absolute fact. But on same level, please dont try to impose the &quot;fact&quot; that GW2 character feel is bad. As long as there are people like me who thinks that it is even better than in WoW (while WoW is still great), it remains just a subjective opinion.<br />

Players who experienced it realize how antiquated and antisocial the system of &quot;tapping&quot; mobs is. Months after GW2 was launched WoW redesigned its quest creatures to share tap and scale up. WoW is also feeling pressured to produce content at a faster pace because of GW2's bi-weekly releases. <br />
<br />
Comparing GW2 to WoW is pretty ridiculous; WoW's success is unprecedented. The truth is though any MMO only needs 200k-500k active users to actually thrive as long as it has a good way to monetize the game. It's actually quite shocking to me that WoW players pay monthly fees for that game in addition to paying for expansions... You do realize that those monthly fees have been more than paying the salaries of producing each expansion, and yet they continue to charge full price for access to it? Let's not forget micro-transactions! I'm also not talking about the Sparkle Pony but rather services like Name Changes, Race Changes, Server Transfers, etc. <br />
<br />
Considering how much ANet is hiring, I'd say they are doing quite swimmingly - which is quite a feat considering how much of a monopoly WoW has had over the MMO market for almost a decade.</div></div><hr />

<br />
GW2 does not have WoW-type raids. If tweaking macros, futzing with your UI and spending weeks to take down a boss is your thing look elsewhere. But if you like dungeon running (33 dungeon paths + Fractals + monthly content dungeons), frequent content updates (every 2 weeks), character customization to the moon, and playing with absolute tons of people everywhere, you will like GW2.<br />
<br />
WvW is the closest thing they have to raiding, there's a whooooole shitton of players that call it raiding, they min/max everything, coordinating entire servers on teamspeak - your server becomes like a mega-guild. It's worth buying the game just for that.<br />
<br />
There's no denying the game's success but there's no &quot;killers&quot; here anywhere. GW2 isn't going anywhere, WoW isn't going anywhere, as gamers we can hope these devs play off the strengths of both games to give us better experiences.</div></div><hr />

Then again everybody's PR is BS... but VANILLA WoW(not the expansions) had more than that in about a year. It was harder to find, I had to put 'time' restrictions on search, but just about every article I can find and every source I can find is citing '4 million' or higher at September 2004. It did have a slower day 1 launch I think, but Wow started becoming a 'firestorm' over the next year.<br />
<br />
The ones I could find are, http://money.cnn.com/2005/09/01/commentary/game_over/column_gaming/ and http://www.gamespot.com//news/world-of-warcraft-subscribers-reach-4-million-6132187? alongside a few other references, but they were to dead links(how time flies in a decade...)</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is mainly wow fanboy site with other games being simply mentioned. You will get hate when fanboys get butthurt.<br />
GW2 is a very good game and going strong. WoW is still going strong despite massive sub losses.<br />
I ended up with playing GW2 mainly and leaving WoW as I didnt like where the game was and is heading.<br />
Not to mention the sub fee being so out of date and retarded these days (yes I can easily afford that - I earn my money on my own so dont need to use mommy/daddy credit card), especially when they start to put up so much shit in Blizz store (way too greedy).<br />
In GW2 I do stuff all time time, in WoW quite often Orgrimmar afk (which is very common with majority of players).<br />
Another thing is achievements - GW2 got me hooked up on em, they are way more interesting and worth of my time - they got em right. Some are retard grindy (WvW ones mainly) that will take ages to complete which blows a bit on one side.<br />
<br />
Thing is both games can deliver (SOO looks pretty cool, but Ill pass on it - raiding got ruind with current blizz design with flex/lfr/norm/hc for me and such short gear lifespawn and crazy ilvl jumps). Maybe next expac will fix it and make WoW entertaining for me (ilvl jumps in vanilla/tbc were perfect).</div></div><hr />

You should be mad about soloing heroic raid content in same expansion - it's just retarded. I'm not suprised Blizzard is loosing 200k subs each month with crap like this.<br />
<br />
Someone geared to the teeth who is not me solo'd the first fight of the first instance of the expansion almost a year after it was introduced and more than likely abused a mechanic makes me absolutely furious bro. I've already shattered my discs and cancelled my account.<br />
<br />
People are calling NCSoft and ArenaNet out on their bullshit smoke and mirrors attempt. That's not getting mad it's called calling their bluff and mocking them for a pathetic attempt at lying.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't hate the game, but when they want to make claims like &quot;Fastest Selling MMO in History *&quot;, they deserve to get smacked down.<br />
<br />
If you actually read their caveat, it says:<br />
&quot;* Based on initial 9 months combined digital and retail unit sales against PC pay-to-play MMORPG games; includes North America, Australia, and Europe.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nine months? How curious why would they choose nine months sales to celebrate their one-year anniversary?<br />
Answer: Because if they include a full year, they *are not the fastest selling MMO in history*. By the end of its first year, WoW had nearly 5 million subscribers. And GW2's sales tanked after the first nine months. Not to even mention comparing current sales to a release in 2004, with a smaller market and when digital sales didn't even exist. So yeah, it's sleazy marketing.<br />

That 5 mill at the end of WoW's first year includes China. Before they went to China (at the nine month mark) they had only 2 million in the US &amp; EU. I'm sure that's why ANet is looking at that time frame.<br />
<br />
GW2 is in beta in China now so maybe next year we can compare those numbers :)</div></div><hr />

You should take a closer look at Blizzard's marketing schemes if you think that's bad.</div></div><hr />

OK.<br />
Show me a Blizzard marketing scheme that is slimier than this one.<br />

Yes, clearly it was for the sake of accuracy that they picked a number that wasn't aligned to their one-year anniversary announcement. :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
I suppose GW2 will be able to show 8 million purchases by the end of their second year to at least keep on pace with WoW's second year. GW2 needs to more than double its first year purchases, even though sales are plummeting in existing markets. Care to wager?<br />
<br />
I expect no less of the &quot;fastest selling MMO of all time&quot;, if they stand behind their marketing.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thessik-Irontail</div><div class="date">2013-09-02, 12:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Only 3.5 Million in the first year? I would sure be interested in the real number, how many are actually still playing of those 3.5 Million. I know that GW2 sold nearly 2 million right when it launched, then the game tanked and you never heard from it again, as large numbers of players left the game after releasing that the anet devs had lied and delivered a shallow and hallow console game trying to pass off as an MMO. My guess is the remaining players of the 3.5 is no more then 1.5 million, which is better then some other games out there, but just no comparison to games like WoW, or even EQ2 for that matter. Now normally this would not be an issue, but for a game that claimed it was going to try to dethrone WoW, and change the MMO genre, etc.. GW2 has had very little, if any at all, lasting impact.<br />
<br />
GW along with TOR, also has the award for the MMO with the most people leaving in the shortest time as well.<br />
<br />
In addition their 2 week updates are a joke, there is no meaningful content being added biweekly.</div></div><hr />
