Valor Points Cap Feedback<br />
Im confused? You dont want people to feel like they have to cap every week? Why a cap then?<br />
There will unfortunately always be people who feel like they have to reach the cap every week, and if there is no cap, then these people will make their own cap which is typically the maximum possible. <br />
<br />
If we had set no cap, then the theoretical maximum of Valor Points possible to acquire in one week would serve as the cap instead... and reaching the theoretical maximum of Valor Points possible to acquire in one week would require a lot of time to play every single day. If that was the case, how do you think that would impact the people who are feeling that they are &quot;forced&quot; to reach the cap every week in order to maximise their gearing process? How do you think that would impact the people who are trying to gear up their alts? How would it impact the new player levelling a new character trying to catch up with his friends who invited him to the game? How would it impact the progress in guilds with a combination of members with a lot of free time to play and members with precious little time to play? <br />
<br />
The cap is both a blessing and a curse. Some are glad it is there, some absolutely despise it and want it gone, some just want it lower, and some want it higher. We are trying to find the best spot for the cap to accommodate as many people as possible, but we cannot please everyone, and that is why the cap is always under constant evaluation. Community feedback on this topic is therefore also super important, as that will help the developers in their evaluations on whether or not the cap is in a good spot.<br />
<br />
So in essence, the cap helps people that is driven by doing their best with the limited time on their hand, actually do other stuff thatnfarming valor.<br />
<br />
Raising the cap would most likely just having people like me only do stuft that awards valor and then miss other aspects of the game entirely.<br />
This is indeed one of the reasons why there is a cap, and why it is where it is currently.<br />
<br />
If we are to lower or raise the cap, we will always need to consider if the people who will be pleased will outnumber the people who will be disappointed... it is not always an easy nor obvious call to make.<br />
<br />
People trying to gear alts would welcome a limitless amount of valor per reset (No cap), essentially they'd be in total control of the character progress, one week they might not have as much time as the next, win / win.<br />
<br />
A new player would also welcome limitless VP gain, he / she could gain ground in hours where friends aren't around, with the current system the new player is locked in whatever stage the person is behind those he's trying to catch up to.<br />
<br />
If the overall goal with the VP was to accommodate as many as possible, then not having a cap would surely be the better option?<br />
These are all very good points, and I would personally agree with you that limitless Valor Points would be a nice thing if it wasn't for the fact that they are intended as a supplement to the normal gearing process. We should not forget that there are more than one reason behind the cap. <br />
<br />
If the acquisition of Valor Points became limitless as you suggest, then we would quickly find the situation to be one where gearing up through Valor Points no longer serves as a supplement to the normal gearing process through facing and defeating different tiers of content. If the acquisition of Valor Points became limitless, it would serve as the primary method of gearing up for a very large group of players (if not almost every player), thus the normal gearing process (through raiding for an example) would be circumvented. Also, limitless Valor Points would likely render everything but the latest content tiers mostly irrelevant, as the game would become all about farming Valor Points for gear through dailies.

Lesser Charm of Good Fortune<br />
40 rolls is still a somewhat small sample size. It only means that you and your friends had some bad luck. As you can see from some of the replies from other players, some have got quite a few items from charms of good fortune, in the end, as the sample size gets bigger and you take into account the rolls of every player in the realm, it all evens out and the experimental drop rate gets closer and closer to the theoretical value that was in the code.

Character<br />
How is logging into alts to do the Blingtron daily a chore? It's less than 5 clicks basically.<br />
How many alts do you have? What if they aren't all in the same place? Why is that a better design than just upping the first gift? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/282208653354860544))<br />
<br />
Are there plans to make the Valor of the Ancient buff account wide rather than realm wide? or is there a technical limitation?<br />
It's a technical limitation. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/281883249402331136))<br />
<br />
Bank Space and stacking up items. What do you think about that? Bags are getting full ever since MoP came.<br />
Yeah, we offered a lot of things like toys and cooking mats that fill up bags. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/281872500575592448))<br />
<br />
So, with helm enchants coming back in 5.2, can we get all the premop helm enchants that were removed back?<br />
I think you are jumping to conclusions about the mechanic. Check it out in game first. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/282561544817082369))<br />
do you see a problem where only pvpers that pve will have this &quot;legendary&quot; head enchant? idc either way, jw.<br />
Players are reading way too much into that patch note. It's not even a head enchant! (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/282609601508163585))<br />
<br />
PvE<br />
arguments against incentivizing 25m raid with same gear as 10m, but upgraded 1 of 2?<br />
We considered it, but the problem is that the 10s couldn't upgrade their gear until 5.1, making 25s drop strictly better gear. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/282300551922864130))<br />
<br />
They didnt blew through content at the start. First tier of raiding and initial dungeons were not consumed fast<br />
But those were content that many players felt were not for them. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/282299962744766464))<br />
<br />
Galleon respawns more freq in 5.2, can we say the same for Oondasta?<br />
Let's just say that Oondasta is going to deliver on the rare and tough design we wanted from Galleon. We are prepared for tears. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/282559474869358592))<br />
<br />
In Cata dungeons seemed to prepare you for Raiding, mop it seems that their role Is gear Not challenging players to be better.<br />
Challenging dungeons work well for groups of friends, not anonymous Dungeon Finder groups. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/282208143201689600))<br />
Challenging dungeons were the main cause of failure in the first half of Cata. They certain damaged cata more than tabards<br />
Broader than that I think. Players blew through some content quickly and couldn't / weren't interested in other content. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/282271185285304320))<br />
But cata had other content. It had daily quests. don't understand why you think they'd be interested now?<br />
Cataclysm's dailies were a totally different beast until the Molten Front quests, which were very popular. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/282566075231649792))<br />
<br />
Are there any plans to let players choose for which role they want drops in LFR? e.g queue as tank but get dps or heal-gear??<br />
We would like to do that. Trying to design a suitable UI. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/282562393421250561))<br />
<br />
Not related to game design, but gf got kicked for low healing in a painless LFR run. 40 mintues gone for nothing. Need to rant<br />
It boggles me when players get focused on hyper efficiency on content that doesn't demand it. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/282560087988502528))<br />

I'm coming back to WoW after a 6 year break. What's changed?<br />
They found Mankrik's wife. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/281875183554404354))<br />

Pointing fingers at the people who made the game just like Jay? I thought you were better than that... (not really)<br />
Most of the people who made vanilla are still here. They would also acknowledge hybrids had very narrow roles in vanilla. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/281860668410445824))<br />

5.2 patch notes are amazing for pvp. Who are you and what have you done with Chilton and Street?<br />
They are bound and gagged in the basement, forced to play Axis and Allies until 5.2 ships. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/282559598077030400))<br />

Still it was really packed when it was current content and even later on there were always quite some people there, even one month before MoP launched there were people there at every time of the day.<br />

I do hope they do add some different colours to the ruins as you progress further and deeper into the raid. The first few minutes of yesterdays video all resemble the same type of ruin and same outdoor area with no different colours- makes it look rather boring- depends on how the creates are going to fit in I guess? : )</div></div><hr />

In Wrath, there was technically no cap on badges, but in order to acquire the maximum amount (four raids per week, all the heroics every day) which no one really ever did. Oh, sure, I'm certain there were some really ridiculously hardcore people out there who capped all the high-tier badges each week, but I think their numbers were sufficiently low that it doesn't really matter. There is always going to be that small group of players who takes every tiny advantage and runs with it. I commend them for trying to even the playing field, but they're just making it more awkward for everyone with these arbitrary caps. It doesn't feel very good to know that after you're capped, if you do anything that earns VP you're basically pissing it away.<br />
<br />
I get why it's there, but before caps, no one felt it was absolutely essential to cap every week if you're serious about raiding. Then caps were introduced and now we do. That tells me more about players and caps than Blizzard seems to be seeing.</div></div><hr />

Well, I expect Oondasta to be harder than the others...and frankly...we hardly manage to get 2(!!!) successful raids on Sha done per week just with players from our server. I think on a dead server like mine you will need all of the remaining 40 best players of my server to be online at a time to get Oondasta down....which will hardly ever happen.</div></div><hr />

What? All you had to do was daily heroics, weekly raid boss and full clear of the current top tier raid, which we usually did after we were done with the progress for the week (plus the weekly quest in ICC past 3.3, but you did that with the clear). You couldn't farm heroics over and over again, you couldn't run endless chain of LFR to produce ridiculous amounts of the high tier emblems. And you only had to farm them until you had every piece of gear you needed for them. Now with the Valor upgrades, you never have to worry about not having anything to do with your VP.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">slowky</div><div class="date">2013-01-04, 03:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">How hard can it be to come up with a UI? They've been using that excuse sinse launch! Not even a hint that it will be in 5.2<br />
<br />
Why not just have the roll of each boss justified by clicking a little icon representing which class you wish to roll for? So, today on each boss we either see a received gold or received loot from the bosses loot table, then we see an additional roll or don't roll button if we have a golden coin. Instead of seeing either of these things we would see two rolls if we have a golden coin, the second roll would have an X in the top right to pass, and both rolls would have 2 or 3 icons depending on how many different roles the class can play. <br />
<br />
Maybe annoying with druids having 4 roles, or perhaps primary dps only having 1 but it's better than people queuing heal and just dps the entire LFR. The icons could be the same as in the talent trees page, very familiar and easy to acknowledge.<br />
<br />
Blizzard has basically done a loot overhaul with this new system in LFR/sha, they might as well go the whole nine yards and make it feel and look different. (and better)<br />
<br />
OR even simpler, how about adding an &gt;arrow to the set Role in raid, and just have each possible role for for the class there.<br />
So something like:<br />
Set Role &gt;&gt;&gt; Dps/Heals/Tank<br />
*click* tank&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br />
Select Loot(checkbox?)<br />
Dps/Heals/Tank<br />
(check tank, check heals)<br />
<br />
This I believe is what Blizzard is wanting to steer clear from with the extra click I guess, but only have to do it with a raid wide role check in sha, or just once in LFR. (or perhaps give the option to switch it per boss and just have it as a sub menu when you are setting your own role via right clicking your portrait)<br />
<br />
There's 2 great ideas right there Blizz, they are all yours I don't need them! Anything to make lfr less of a pain for people :). My luck in lfr hasn't been that bad but I don't really enjoy the system, and more player interactions is fun even with just the UI.</div></div><hr />

With the shared tag, there won't be the race to get 40 people and burn down a boss that isn't going to kill you. Yes, I know about dropping raid after the tag and joining another 39 man to share the tag that is currently in place, so people don't bring that up.<br />
<br />
With Oondasta, he will have traditional raid wipe mechanics. If someone screws up, it can all go down hill very, very fast. This is not present with Galleon. People will need to be deliberate, and take their time on him. <br />
<br />
While rarer, I believe we'll see him more often due to him not being instantly killed in 8 minutes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Again, this is isn't the point.<br />
<br />
Not everyone plays all 11 alts every single day. But before, when Blingtron popped, you'd stop what you were doing and waste 10 minutes logging on and off, flying/hearthing to the location of the blingtron you found. <br />
<br />
If you happened to find another one on your main on the same day, you'd have to hurry up, log off again, and repeat the process. Now, no matter what character you see it on, you just do it once and you're done for the day. The drop rates have been adjusted to compensate for this, what more do you want?<br />
<br />
Did you WANT to do Blingtron on 11 characters a day? Surely not. Mounts are account wide now (which is the only reason to use Blingtron), so if you're the lucky .01% that gets the mount, it doesn't matter if you're on an alt or main.</div></div><hr />
