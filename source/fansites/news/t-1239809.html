World First Heroic Elite 25 Protectors of the Endless<br />
黎明之翼 (http://www.battlenet.com.cn/wow/zh/guild/%E7%9F%B3%E7%88%AA%E5%B3%B0/%E9%BB%8E%E6%98%8E%E4%B9%8B%E7%BF%BC/) (Wings of Aurora) was able to kill Protector Kaolan (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/60583-protector-kaolan) last and defeat Elite difficulty Protectors of the Endless. It appears that it was a close fight, as not many of them were alive for looting. Their best attempt before the nerf was 6% and progress was being made towards a kill. <br />
<br />
Killing the bosses in the encounter in this order gives them access to the item level 516 loot (http://www.wowdb.com/items?filter-ilvl-min=516&amp;filter-ilvl-max=516). Congratulations to them! <br />
<br />
Because this was in China (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/2983-Separate-10-and-25-Man-Raid-Lockout-and-Reward-Changes-in-Korea), the loot becomes item level 524 (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2012/december/china25Loot.jpg) once it is looted, and is upgradeable two more times.<br />

Heroic Difficulty Boss Changes<br />
Two Heroic mode encounters in the Heart of Fear and the Terrace of Endless Spring are changing with the Raid reset this week:<br />
<br />
<br />
Grand Empress Shek'zeer<br />
The damage dealt by Corrupted Dissonance (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/126122-corrupted-dissonance-field), Sonic Discharge (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/123504-sonic-discharge), and Cry of Terror (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/123792-cry-of-terror) has been reduced by approximately 10% in the Heroic mode version of this encounter.<br />
<br />
<br />
Protectors of the Endless<br />
The damage dealt by Touch of Sha (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/117519-touch-of-sha) no longer increases for each Protector that is defeated in the Heroic mode version of this encounter.<br />
<br />
<br />
Patch 5.2 - Excess Valor Points to Justice Points<br />
There are some changes planned for 5.2, for example, we would like to make Valor points convert to Justice as long as you’re Valor capped.<br />

Battleground Gear Disparity<br />
Simply tier the BGs by ilvl.<br />
It's not simple, unfortunately. It would a) require a retooling of how Battlegrounds assemble teams and b) even under ideal conditions, it would likely slow down queue times dramatically. As Ovenmitz demonstrates, there are a lot of players who are very opposed to that.<br />
<br />
It's not that we aren't interested in making Battlegrounds a better experience, it's that we need to make sure that whichever steps we take actually meet that goal. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/248474-the-easiest-solution-to-gear-disparity/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/7415642417?page=1#5))<br />
<br />
World PvP Feedback<br />
Would it not be possible to mark characters (say x levels under your own) in gray, and if a player over the limit of x tries to attack they are presented with the message &quot;you cannot attack that target&quot;? (Similarily, a player x lvs under gets the same message if trying to attack a target x lvs over).<br />
It’s possible to do that, but it’s just something we decide not to. PvP realms have been here since day 1. Players know what the rules are before they join a PvP realm, the environment can be frustrating at times but it can also be a lot of fun and very challenging, that’s why players they go there.<br />
<br />
I think the difference between PvP and PvE realms was felt much deeper in the old days of vanilla. That was when world PvP was probably at its peak, places like Tarren Mill, Southshore and Tanaris were truly a permanent battle zone. But one has to realize that the game evolves and while we enjoy world PvP, we also enjoy giving players more options. <br />
<br />
So what happened? Well for starters, battlegrounds were introduced, so a big chunk of players that was constantly doing world PvP immediately switched to Battlegrounds, these were purposely made for PvP, it’s just natural that they become more appealing and take away some of the ganking going around in the world. Even if this wasn’t probably a complete switch, it certainly reduced the average amount of players out in the world looking for PvP. Is this a bad thing? That depends on whether you prefer world PvP or Battlegrounds.<br />
Then we had some more game expansions and in addition to the classic Battlegrounds we got Arenas and even more Battlegrounds. We also introduced quality of life (controversial, we know!) queuing systems where we let people instantly teleport into dungeons/raids without risking their necks out there in the wilderness.<br />
<br />
Without getting into much detail, the point is, as time went on, the amount of players out in the world got reduced, while the amount of players inside cities increased, this created 2 issues: one, it increased the likelihood of low level ganking to occur, since levelling players tend to quest and they have to be out there in the world to do so; and two, it decreased the chance of someone high level being around you to defend the members of his own faction.<br />
<br />
So, yes, world PvP decreased significantly but we’re trying to turn that around with Mists of Pandaria.<br />
My whole point is that, between vanilla and Mists, world PvP changed so much that making the choice between being on a PvE or PvP realm might have stopped being as hard to make as it used to be, but the fact remains that PvP realms were always meant to be about freedom, allowing factions to feel that they are truly at war, how can you feel that if you suddenly have restrictions on how/who/when you can attack?<br />
<br />
Personally I welcome this change of direction with Mists but I look at it very carefully as this isn’t vanilla anymore and there a lot of variables that we need to pay close attention to if we want to make world PvP as entertaining as it once was. I’m talking about faction imbalance on certain realms (where possibly CRZ tech might be able to help out), flying mounts as easy ways to escape danger, and lack of the “I’ll get my revenge soon” feeling with CRZ possibly reducing the chance of the same players seeing each other again.

<br />
nope.<br />
<br />
Aside from korea, both china and taiwan servers have the changes (+8ilv in 25man, +8%hp for 25man bosses, +8%damage for 25man bosses)<br />
<br />
side notes: China server restarts today so this is a post-nerf kill. They did have a 5% wipe pre-nerf though, which, with the buff in heroic mode, is like a 1~2% wipe on other bosses.<br />
<br />
<br />
And their raid composition FYI<br />
2 tanks: 1 prot warrior, 1 blood dk<br />
5 healers: 3 disc priest, 2 restro shaman<br />
18 dds: 5 mage, 5 shadow priest, 3 moonkins, 2 hunter, 2 warlock, 1 elemental shaman</div></div><hr />

the armoury doesn't take into account the change to ilvl on the character sheet, neither does it track item upgrade level, so it will show as a tooltip 516ilvl on the heroic elite gear, when in actual fact, it is much higher.</div></div><hr />

Hard mode version of a Heroic Raid encounter. :-)<br />
Some multiple target boss fights (that didn't have shared hp pool) like bug family in AQ40, Eredar twins in SWP, or the Iron Council in Ulduar had better loot when killed in a specific order (obviously the hardest order brought the best loot). In the case of Protectors, it's killing Kaloan (the one with the most hp) last.</div></div><hr />

well back then there was no &quot;heroic&quot; version it was normal and some bosses had a hard mode<br />
this fight here was on heroic and also with the hard mode so they call it heroic elite.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well Heroic Elite is the classification of the loot. There's Raid Finder, normal (without any tag), Elite (normal Elite), Heroic and Heroic Elite (yes, that encounter has 5 versions of every piece of loot it drops.). And as people could confuse Hard Mode with Heroic mode, this is much clearer labeling.</div></div><hr />

probally gonna take a while before this kill happens on Eu or US, since there loot goes in a lot slower with 1 lock a week instead of 2.<br />

What the hell would you rather they say, even if they did agree with whatever contrived grievance you have with the unneeded discussion of what is basically &quot;I don't like the realm I joined?&quot; Would you rather blizzard say &quot;I don't like the way it is, but it doesn't matter, because it's staying that way anyway?&quot;<br />

Saying ganking is acceptable is like saying stealing candy from babies is okay (taken to a new extreme, of course) - its revolvingly unfair, even if there's potential for recriminations from someone on equal or higher power. And I can't stand the fact its known about and uncared about by the very people who are 'in charge'.<br />

Because Asian blizzard hq has different policy then us/eu one. They are like a separate company from the main hq. That's why it's rather &quot;Asian First&quot;, rather then &quot;World First&quot;. I'm not denying that it IS world first but under different rules. That's why imo it's hard to compare it to non - Asian progress.</div></div><hr />

It is also because they get separate lock outs between 10 and 25 and 25 mans get a higher ilvl like WotLK was. Part of this is due to their subscription model being pay by the hour if I recall correctly and by splitting the lock outs, players spend more time in the game.</div></div><hr />

what pathethic is , is that it is YOUR choice to level on a PvP server. They give you enouch choice to NOT level on a PvP server. If you do not wish to be ganked , roll a PvE server. And yes that is THE answer. I leveled my monk from 1-90 through questing , and yes i got ganked , i got killed by 5 90s but what ever. I sucked it up and just logged my hunter or my shaman and do stuff in that chars. When i am on a 90 char and i am bored yes i hunt around and seek low levels to kill them. What else is there to do when your bored? <br />
<br />
Saying it is pathethic from blizzard side if just complete bullshit , you are the one and only pathethic guy who can't handle his own shit. If you do not like PvP why roll a fucking PvP server? Ofc if your sorry ass is in SW or Shrine all day long it is no problem , but don't expect me to leave you alone when your out in the open.</div></div><hr />

What? He isn't wrong. And it technically is PvP considering you can kill a 90 with enough lowbies. Granted they don't have much of a chance when the 90 aoes have more damage from them than the lowbie has health. So if you don't want to PvP leveling roll on a PvE server. The only ignorant one here is you.</div></div><hr />

Player A (level 90) attacks Player B (level 30)<br />
Weird, I'm seeing Player vs Player.<br />
<br />
Just because it's dishonorable and cowardly doesn't mean it's not PvP.<br />
<br />
So goddamn stupid that people are complaining about getting killed on a realm that is supposed to allow such things. Guess that's what PvP turned into when the zones were dead, before CRZ. PvE realm leveling with some occasional pvp in Pandaria. Guess these are the one's who constantly cry in the Jade Forest general chat.<br />

@PvP debate: As someone that played on a PvP realm from early BC till end of Wrath I find these ganking discussions quite hilarious. You don't like ganking? go PvE.

You have a stacking buff that increases your damage by 10% (stacks 9 times).<br />
You don't multidot on this fight, it's only single target (except for the little adds you have to kill)</div></div><hr />

It actually depends on your gear and tactics, but it can be beneficial to multidot to get more Mind Spike procs.<br />

10 man and 25 man /=. You think Paragon is a normal 10 mans guild... 95 % of the 10 mans guilds have inferior skills.... 25 mans is dedication.<br />

His next argument should be that you can only attack another faction if there are ten players from each side prepared to fight. If you want to attack a single player, you have to do something like drop a big banner.. and they must agree to fight you... Because, you know, that is the only ´real´ pvp..<br />

Well remember boss damage and health got increased too, so i disagree with your reasoning, but i believe that they should be counted in their own race as they may face different problems than what the EU/US guilds face.</div></div><hr />

no 2X lockouts nowadays... the only advantage on asian server is we got 8 lvl higher root in 25m raid... kinda net off the 8% health and dmg</div></div><hr />

No they didn't make it. For Asia its a different game entirely, anyone who thinks differently is dreaming. They have access to separate 25m and 10m lockouts, as well as LFR. They have more chances to complete set bonuses and get gear than NA/EU guilds. 8% increase does not account for that. If there are gear requirements for encounters, Asia will be able to make those requirements faster than NA/EU guilds.<br />
<br />
Another note, it was announced NA/EU would get the nerfs after raid reset which had not happened when the post was made. Doesn't that mean they got access to nerfed protectors before NA/EU?</div></div><hr />

Weird, I'm seeing Player vs Player.<br />
<br />
Just because it's dishonorable and cowardly doesn't mean it's not PvP.<br />
<br />
So goddamn stupid that people are complaining about getting killed on a realm that is supposed to allow such things. Guess that's what PvP turned into when the zones were dead, before CRZ. PvE realm leveling with some occasional pvp in Pandaria. Guess these are the one's who constantly cry in the Jade Forest general chat.<br />
<br />
Roll PvE or deal with it.<br />

<br />
Unless there was a exploit done then it is a clean world first kill.<br />
<br />
They are completely and utterly different situations. 10 man guilds and 25 man guilds on US and EU realms have no real advantage over each other(other than EU getting patches later, but that's a whole different matter). This tier - like most of Cataclysm - is pretty well balanced between the two raid sizes. There are some fights that are easier on 10 man and some fights that are easier on 25 man. It's never going to be perfect, but 10 vs 25 is about as close to being balanced as it can ever be.<br />
<br />
Asian guilds are at a distinct advantage now because not only is their loot 8 ilevels higher than the loot in US and EU, they get two lockouts per week so they gear up twice as fast. You cannot compare two brackets with an entirely different rule set that heavily, heavily, heavily favors one over the other.<br />
<br />
Nobody is taking away from the kill. That fight is a beast and even with all the advantages they have they barely pulled it off and I can't wait to see a video(if they ever release one). But you can't compare Asian kills to US and EU kills because they play by a completely and utterly different rule set that favors the Asian guilds.<br />

<br />
Maybe because the severe nerfs just went into effect a couple hours ago and most US raiding guilds don't raid at 8AM PST(when the nerfs went live, unless I'm wrong on the raid reset timers) and I don't think it's even live in the EU yet. <br />
<br />
And how do you know no guilds were within 8% of killing it before today's nerfs? Guilds don't tend to post news saying, &quot;Missed it by THAT MUCH!&quot;</div></div><hr />

They have 8% health and (I think) do 8% more damage. Their gear is 8 ilevel higher, but the REAL advantage in races is having two raid lockouts per week, giving your raid twice the gear as US and EU guilds.</div></div><hr />

They give you enouch choice to NOT level on a PvP server. If you do not wish to be ganked , roll a PvE server. And yes that is THE answer. I leveled my monk from 1-90 through questing , and yes i got ganked , i got killed by 5 90s but what ever. I sucked it up and just logged my hunter or my shaman and do stuff in that chars. When i am on a 90 char and i am bored yes i hunt around and seek low levels to kill them. What else is there to do when your bored? <br />

Saying it is pathethic from blizzard side if just complete bullshit , you are the one and only pathethic guy who can't handle his own shit. If you do not like PvP why roll a fucking PvP server?

They're the super saiyan mode bosses of this tier. They have like nine total difficulties. LFR, 10 man normal, 10 man normal elite, 10 man heroic, 10 man heroic elite. 25 man normal, 25 man normal elite, 25 man heroic, 25 man heroic elite.<br />
<br />
The bosses gain abilities and extra damage as you kill them, and killing them in a certain order(&quot;elite mode&quot;) gives you higher ilevel loot(tagged as &quot;elite&quot; for normal mode or &quot;heroic elite&quot; for heroic mode). It's basically a more fleshed out version of the Iron Council encounter in Ulduar. Heroic Elite mode was generally regarded as unkillable until some nerfs that went live today, because if you did the elite mode by the time you got to the last boss their AoE was pumping out 300K+ damage every three seconds to everyone in the raid.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That is the very basic definition of what PvP is and Blizzard agrees with this. So long as it is one player fighting another player, it doesn't matter if one of the players is invulnerable to all damage, can stay permanently invisible and one shot everything within 100 yards. <br />
<br />
Most of you are saying a Level 90 vs a level 1 is just unfair and it is slaughter. While I completely agree it is unfair and it is slaughter since the level 1 has a 0% chance of winning it is still one player fighting another player. The very instant one player attacks another it becomes PvP. Stop changing the definition of PvP to suit your argument :-\<br />

<br />
I played WoW when it was actually a MMO. I played when it could take 10 to 15 min to hand in a quest in STV due to all the ganking, usually by equal level players from the opposite faction, going on. I played when players would come from around Kalimdor to defend the lowbies at Crossroads who were being tormented by 1 or 2 max level alliance players. I played when if you were getting ganked by that one complete idiot max level guy in a lowbie zone you either logged on to another character, spirit rezzed and headed to another area (because contrary to popular belief you don't absolutely have to finish the particular quest you are on this exact moment) and/or you logged onto your max level character and got a few friends and camped the bully until he got tired of it.<br />
<br />
And guess what...I sucked at pvp and still enjoyed it.<br />
<br />
But Blizzard destroyed world pvp mostly do to their blind desire to appease the lowest common denominator and instituting features designed to cater to the crowd who wants everything handed to them on a silver platter. But the lesson they have failed to learn from Cata is that you can't put the genie back in the bottle. You can't create true herooic dungeons because you have devalued the worth of 5 mans and created a generation of players lacking both skill, patience, work ethic and teamwork. <br />
<br />
Expecting this crowd, the majority of the current player base, to have to tag their own mobs, compete for resources or tolerate getting ganked was a miscalculation similar to &quot;real&quot; Cata heroics.<br />
<br />
That being said, I always thought defending the appropriateness of the one max level idiot in Tarren Mills ganking lowbies was a bit of a stretch. The solution to the current problem, and to placate the whiners, is actually to steal another idea from another MMO. In GW2 when you enter a lower level zone you are scaled to the level of the zone. Of course you still have more tools to works (skills &amp; resistance etc) but the fight is a lot more fair and if 1 lowbie couldn't kill you then at least 2 or 3 would be able to where in WoW 30 don't stand a chance.<br />
<br />
That's the solution though I doubt blizzard will ever do it.</div></div><hr />

No Heroic Elite Protectors was not done by any guild 10m or 25m. Some people in the US got heroic elite protector gear because of the bugged coin rolls on normal elite protectors. And Asia has a completely different game. They have separate 25m and 10m lockouts. That gives them more chances at set pieces and overall better gear.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">hflsintution</div><div class="date">2012-12-20, 04:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Maybe because the severe nerfs just went into effect a couple hours ago and most US raiding guilds don't raid at 8AM PST(when the nerfs went live, unless I'm wrong on the raid reset timers) and I don't think it's even live in the EU yet. <br />
<br />
And how do you know no guilds were within 8% of killing it before today's nerfs? Guilds don't tend to post news saying, &quot;Missed it by THAT MUCH!&quot;<br />
<br />
This is ridiculous. The US and EU server always updated at least a week ahead of the Chinese server. From your perspective none of the FDs were &quot;World First&quot; since chinese guilds hadn't got the chance yet.</div></div><hr />
