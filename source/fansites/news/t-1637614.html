It's funny how before the x-pac the shitstorm of doomsayers and negative nancies complaiuend about how lacking the x-pac was and how bad it'd be. Oooh, the sweet irony. Just proves that the complaining is always a part of the xpac cycle.<br />
<br />
<br />
will obviously go down in the next few months tho :(<br />
Obviously it goes down over time, but this is the largest jump any expansion has experienced since WotLK, which is pretty well regarded as one of the best expansions. If Blizzard keeps it up like this, it may end up being another really good expansion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, if you go from having a steady 12 million players, to almost 7 million players, one would assume they might've scaled back on some of the hardware. Why pay for the uptime of hardware that wasn't being used? So it's possible that some of that hardware was used to deal with the almost 3 million additional players at WoD launch, as well as the purchase of additional hardware.</div></div><hr />

<br />
WoW gained 900k users during pre expansion MoP to MoP's second month.<br />
<br />
WoW gained over 3Million users not during pre-expansion MoP but during a month before and the first two weeks of WoD.<br />
The numbers there also do not include Asia for obvious reasons.</div></div><hr />

Long queue times are most likely due not to overabundance of players, but rather extreme lack of (tanks).<br />

<br />
To be honest, the marketing team is probably the reason for the MASSIVE jump.<br />
<br />
That and the fact that the cinematics they made probably got a lot of people to remember WC 1 &amp; 2 since we haven't had much of the Draenor lore before this. Plus all around this expansion is amazing and the detail they put into stuff is very incredible(have you explored the insides of little houses?

<br />
In a year we'll see if the content is good enough to hold the subs. Aside from never having to leave your garrison, the game feels exactly like Cataclysm to me. If it's just that wind mechanic on every boss on the first raid, it's all ogre for me. Hope it'll be good.</div></div><hr />

A. None of the current 7 million subscribers bought WoD.<br />
B. Current subscribers upgraded and 3 million people returned to play MoP.<br />

&quot;Warlords of Draenor has sold over 3.3 million copies so far&quot;<br />

So the other 6.7million players are not playing WoD?<br />

Most people don't adapt easily, check the mop, cataclysm and wrath initial sales on first day of launch, they are generally in the 3-4 million area aswell.</div></div><hr />

World of Warcraft’ s Subscriber Definition<br />
World of Warcraft subscribers include individuals who have paid a subscription fee or have an active prepaid card to play World of Warcraft, as well as those who have purchased the game and are within their free month of access.<br />

They post them because they have to declare their revenue not to show nonameX or nonameY on the forums how many subs they have. They have to release the exact number of subs or it would be illegal. Hence why they can't count trial accounts (like most people like to say).</div></div><hr />

As Blizzard is a public company, it has to follow the laws, in this case, it needs to be transparent to the share holders. Which means, they have to show subs. They would do also if they would have 2 million and 25 million subs, they literally have to.</div></div><hr />

Personally I find this game to be extremely boring but that's probably because I can't actually commit to raiding or anything. I have 2 92s so far this late into the expansion. Too bad really, MMOs are going to be stuck in the same hole for another 5 years for sure now. Trying to copy WoW.</div></div><hr />

They mean that WoD didn't launch in Asia until today, so that 10m doesn't include any corresponding increase in players in Asia. It just includes the previous non-WoD asian players.</div></div><hr />

<br />
People will say “Yeah but MoP had 10 million too” but according to the long term downward trend that begun at the end of WOTLK, they were losing roughly 2 million subs per expansion start. Cataclysm had 12 million thanks mainly to WOTLK, MoP had 10 million.. the trend was WoD 8 million or less.<br />
<br />
And let’s not forget MoP had 6.8 million last year. So they’ve added 3.2 million subs in less than a year. That is phenomenal for a 10 year old game. Just look at how sharp that upwards line is on the graph.. you have to go back to the end of 2005 to find a jump that steep. Amazing.<br />
<br />
What does this tell us? WoW still has an amazingly strong and attractive foundation and if Blizzard can make true on their promise to keep the content regular and of a high quality.. they could be set for even bigger numbers. <br />
<br />
I get goosebumps imagining how this has gone down with Blizzard and in particular people like Chris Metzen. It’s also shown them their decision to put their MMO eggs back into the WoW basket was the right move. <br />
<br />
May the good times continue. Enjoy them folks.</div></div><hr />

I thought it wouldn't ever get above 10M. I had hoped it wouldn't too, I want a better game to play. WoW is pretty boring. Seems WoW is going to be king for another 5 years again. I'm tired of garbage games trying to copy it, oh well. We'll see how many it holds on to though over the new months. I'm guessing everyone just VASTLY underestimated how much people hated Pandas. I'm not really sure where all these resubs came from either.</div></div><hr />

If Quality of Gameplay speaks of anything, Warlords of Draenor deserves 12.5 Million Subscribers or more. It's by FAR best MMO I've ever played. The leveling design was nothing short of perfect, the story, the garrisons, everything has been amazing, now that my Server isn't stuck with a Queue anymore. I just hit Level 100, and I'm actually in awe with this game again in a way I haven't been since Wrath (when I joined). <br />

Blizzard has made the perfect expansion, IMO.</div></div><hr />

Only 2 Million from the peak, but still to gain 2 million subs they would have to not only maintain the 10 million, but pull in more subs. We will have to see if they can do it.</div></div><hr />

According to the release Asia just launched today and those numbers are from the 13th. So they don't include any increase from the Asian markets and honestly they don't include any new subs that came in on launch day or after.</div></div><hr />

B. Current subscribers upgraded and 3 million people returned to play MoP.<br />

Think about it. I'm calling bullshit.<br />

two things<br />

B. WOW is a very casual game, a lot of people don´t play every day, or maybe even every week. My guild is full of people who play a few hours once a week. They just have no reason to rush off to buy an expansion.</div></div><hr />

Also, I like how they set the date of the report on November 13th, not a few days after when people ended their subscriptions out of frustration.<br />
<br />
dude, give it up.. probably even the mod of the subredit didn´t unsubscribe because of 1 or 2 days of bad servers. They gave 5 free days, I am sure anyone that did put in their cancel notice was also still playing by the time the servers were fixed and the 5 days came out. At the end of a few weeks, nobody remembers the first day.</div></div><hr />

Asia doesn't buy expansions &amp; their are alot of people who play WoW &amp; don't have the expansion yet. I know like 4 people who havn't bought the expansion yet, I ask them why. But they say they are in no rush. Can't argue with that.</div></div><hr />

Pandaria is possibly the best xpack to date. It had good raiding and amazingly well thought out themes that were carried out to perfection. A lot of people didn't care for the Chinese feeling but..... Also, I didn't see anyone at all complain about the decidedly Scandinavian feel of WOTLK and it has even less to do with WoW than China so what was really the problem here?<br />

I like WoD so far but....I see a slump coming up if you do not raid or pvp heavily (land a vast majority of players do not). We will simply run out of things to do. It just feels very scripted and controlled and that doesn't last long.</div></div><hr />

I played UO for 6 years prior to wow and never had any idea what the sub numbers were, or cared. I still don't care, but its interesting to see how many people do. I'm still curious about why people care.<br />
<br />
I played UO for 6 years up until WOW also. Back then, we certainly were all over sub numbers. They were used all the time in the Trammel vs Felucca wars. Back then even a 10,000 subscriber increase was used as ´proof´ that something worked well in the game.<br />
<br />
I won´t say this for WOW, but for every other MMORPG, subscription numbers matter a great deal because they usually indicate the loss of dev jobs, which you saw with Wildstar recently. When subs start to fall, it takes only a few months until the layoffs come.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It does include China players who were playing MoP for the last month<br />
It does not include players from china who have not subscribed in the last 30 days, but will likely play in the day when WoD is released.<br />
<br />
Probably the majority of china players are accounted for in that 10M, but there still could be a significant bump if there were a lot of them who haven´t logged in during the past 30 days.</div></div><hr />

<br />
While I've been critical about Blizz and cynical about WoW, I will agree that this shows WoW is, indeed, not dead. There's obviously still a big pool of potential customers. Which, in turn, means that when subs do drop, it is not because of some &quot;natural product cycle&quot; or anything like that, but because Blizz has made choices with the game that people disliked.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I can totally vouch for that. If anyone is on the fence of buying WoD, you should not be. Actually, just check the realm status on the official site for the region you play on. Majority of them are medium and when they are full or high, they don't have Qs anymore. If they do have Qs, it's small due to the new instancing technology they are using to make multiple copies of the server to increase server capacity.<br />

<br />
The test is going to be the same as always, though: KEEPING those subs. <br />
<br />
My hope is, Blizzard is proactive this time. They dropped the ball with Pandaria, especially where content was concerned. That cannot happen this time if they want to keep these subs anywhere near the 10 million mark.</div></div><hr />

The servers are pretty much stable now, haven't had a queue or crash in days. I've also still got a few friends who hadn't re-subbed yet, but now that WoD's out and they can see more of it, I'm pretty sure they'll bite the bullet. Which means that number can still increase even more.<br />
<br />
Anyway... Good riddance to the pandas, and this graph pretty much proves that not many people liked MoP as much as its defenders claim. Sadly, I'll still have to see them, Monks and cloud serpents on occasion, but at least they're not very prevalent.<br />
<br />
I always hailed WotLK as the best expac ever... But honestly, WoD might actually surpass that. I'm very impressed.</div></div><hr />

Wrath was just good. Engaging storyline, good game improvements, and decent pacing with raids. <br />
<br />
Notice the sharp drop in Cata tho cause it sucked. :P~~ I was one of 'em, I leveled in cata and then quit.<br />

Should edit to add...if WoD end game is as good as Wrath, this xpac would definitely be up there with it in terms of quality.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't think that's entirely accurate, or fair to MoP. People who quit (in Cata, for example) have only the vaugest idea of what's currently going on in-game. It takes good word of mouth, among other things, to get them to be willing to come back and check things out.<br />
<br />
While MoP certainly had its flaws (rep gating, dailies), and things that didn't appeal to some players (Pandas &amp; Pokemon), it did a lot of nifty things, too. I think it had the best world design since vanilla, possibly better.</div></div><hr />

They really make the world feel alive. I mean, I've been back to Stormwind 3 times since the expansion launched, and that was for about 5 minutes each time. No more afking in capital cities for me; I'm actually out in the world doing stuff.<br />
