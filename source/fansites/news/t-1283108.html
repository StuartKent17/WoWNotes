<br />
New incentives for climbing the ladders are a good thing - although it's so steep atm that the enchants, tabard and cloak are only for the super high end players (Read: Duelist+). The ladders will only grow larger if incentives are given across the board, like the old gearing system where gear required 1350/1400/1500/1550/1650/1800/1900/2000/2200 rating to buy - smaller gaps between rewards are motivation for people to reach that next plateau. Nothing will change if the average player doesn't have anything to fight for.<br />

Hi. You must be new here. I know that it's a mean, condescending and arrogant thing to say, but the ONLY legendaries that weren't grinds, were the Warglaives and the bow from SWP. ''nowadays'' implies that you already possess that knowledge.</div></div><hr />

And I would considering killing a boss again and again for a low % drop chance for the item still grinding, so in reality there has been NO legendary in the game that has not been about grinding.</div></div><hr />

I concur, but also offer the counter argument that some people might get it on the very first kill, nullifying the need to grind said item - which is why I highlighted those in particular :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
Good Icon art takes time. Now get rid of that revamped Theramore tower. :&lt;<br />
<br />
<br />
And I would considering killing a boss again and again for a low % drop chance for the item still grinding, so in reality there has been NO legendary in the game that has not been about grinding.<br />
ONLY if you go back to that boss just for the Legendary. Else you'd kill that boss anyway for it's epixx, so Legendaries involved 0 grind. Only RNG. Same as today I guess.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just the other day I was in my raid thinking &quot;you know what I need? Better 90 talents, more dps? nah...I want new icons for portal/teleport to vale&quot; My mind prayers were answered! Can't wait to get on to ptr and take some screenshots. Jealousy will be running rampant.</div></div><hr />

Good one blizz I'm still 0 of 20 on them secrets of the empire cause legendary = grinding now a days it seems.<br />
<br />
Lol seriously? Obviously this is your first legendary, or you would know that every single one has been more grindy except ones like the bow that just drop...</div></div><hr />

<br />
All we need now are 30+ slot bags that don't cost 5000 gold + a week of mats to create. WTB more bag space :|</div></div><hr />

She hates Garrosh as much as Vol'jin, I was hoping to see her doing something significant on 5.3 but looks like the Trolls gonna be the focus...Again.<br />
There's something wrong, she wouldn't let Garrosh call her bitch without doing nothing...<br />
<br />
It seems that Vol'jin gonna be the new Warchief after all.</div></div><hr />

Hmm... I didn't pay much for my bags. Only a few coppers for the raw materials and I got that back while grinding the rep. Patience, my dear. Patience. Top bags were always gated and expensive.</div></div><hr />

He is a Troll, so ..... NO.<br />
A Troll will NEVER be Warchief of the (Orc)Horde.</div></div><hr />
