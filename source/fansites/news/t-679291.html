Blizzard released their own preview of Shadowmourne, the legendary Axe found in Icecrown Citadel. I also posted a small preview of the questlines a while back, see below. <br />
<br />
Shadowmourne's Preview (http://www.mmo-champion.com/news-2/hallow's-end-issue-shadowmourne-comics)<br />
Item - Shadowmourne Legendary (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/71903/item-shadowmourne-legendary/) is the proc of this weapon<br />
<br />
Before beginning his reign as the Lich King, Prince Arthas Menethil was first a servant, ruled by a sword he believed was the key to saving his people - the runeblade Frostmourne. Finding and claiming the blade among the frozen wastes of Northrend was an odyssey unto itself, and the search cost the prince his mentor, his relationship with his subjects, and his humanity. It cost the living of Azeroth far more.<br />
<br />
With a tight grip on the blade that he traded his life for, Arthas ravaged the kingdom of Lordaeron and broke free from the control of the Burning Legion. By the time the former prince ascended as the leader of the Scourge, Frostmourne was already glutted with the souls of the numberless dead who dared to oppose him.<br />
<br />
Now, Arthas has become so inseparable from his weapon that the sword's likeness has even found its way into the architecture of his fortress, Icecrown Citadel. Its hilt is never far from his hands; its ghostly whispers constantly ring in his ears. Frostmourne, as much as the Lich King, is the ruler of Northrend.<br />
<br />
To challenge that rule, mighty heroes will need to follow more closely in Arthas's path than ever before.<br />
<br />
In a relentless quest to arm the forces of the living against the Scourge, Darion Mograine has formed the Ashen Verdict, a union between the most skilled craftsmen of the Argent Crusade and the Ebon Blade. Though the peerless paladins of the Crusade wield the power of the Light, and their leader clutches Ashbringer, a few of Mograine's dark warriors have begun to question their hopes for victory.<br />
<br />
These death knights insist that the Ashbringer and the skills of the Argent Crusaders, though potent, aren't enough to best Frostmourne alone. They swear that Darion Mograine has long been quietly aware of another legendary blade - one that could be the key to defeating the Lich King and cleansing Northrend... But it doesn't exist yet.<br />
<br />
For the moment, the weapon is a formless idea, with no more killing power than an angry thought. When it is spoken of, it is spoken of quietly, and the Highlord has a habit of silencing those who discuss it in public.<br />
<br />
But the hope of an artifact to rival Frostmourne is strong within the minds of the Ebon Blade. Just its name inspires the furnaces to burn late into the night, the bellows to pump air, and the darker half of the Verdict's smiths to swing their hammers until their fingers fail. While other craftsmen crafters lean over whetstones and gather pitted blades by the hundreds, these few dream of a single weapon to end the war for Northrend.<br />
<br />
Shadowmourne... A great two-handed axe fit for a giant, born of sacred and corrupt powers, host of a thousand dead souls and able to be wielded only by the most stalwart armsmasters of Azeroth. Its creation seems nearly impossible; and yet, the rumors do not cease.<br />
<br />
Some smiths claim that Shadowmourne must be nothing more than an ordinary axe, honed to unparalleled perfection, while others would shape it from a weapon of immense import in the world. Mograine, when he can be convinced to speak of it at all, is said to believe that only the hammer of Arthas himself will provide a worthy model - but such absurd ambition is just the beginning of Shadowmourne's creation.<br />
<br />
To contain the energies that dance across its cold edges, Shadowmourne must be hewn from piles of impure Saronite: the hardened blood of the Old God, Yogg-Saron, treated only by master metal-shapers.<br />
To fuel its power to kill, it is vital that Shadowmourne be drenched in the souls of the most potent servants of the Scourge as they are slain, one by one, with the unfinished blade.<br />
To help break through the Lich King's armor, Shadowmourne is to be adorned with fragments of the Frozen Throne, originally crafted by Kil'Jaeden out of ice from the Twisting Nether.<br />
<br />
Only with these mighty components, it's said, can Shadowmourne be finished. And, yet, even if the axe could be completed, questions and fears remain. Is forging the souls of the deceased into a weapon treated withblood and the essence of the Twisting Nether truly any different from the crafting of the Scourge's runeblades?<br />
<br />
Who is to say that the Lich King wouldn't simply annihilate - or control - the maker for their impudence in mimicking his most treasured possession? If Arthas, one of the most dedicated knights of his age, lost his humanity to the whispers of Frostmourne, might Shadowmourne bring the same doom and misery tothe living as its sister blade?<br />
<br />
Without knowing the answers to these questions, who would be bold enough to try and wield it?<br />

<br />
Uh have you seen the quest line to get it...? You need to go get arthas' old mace and break it down then get 12 infused saronite then stand in front of sindragosa's breath 4 times to inbue it with frost, collect putricide's slime to infuse it with unholyness and the one of the blood queens attacks to infuse it with blood. THEN you need to collect 45 ice shards from the frozen throne which will no doubt be a boss drop only AND then you need to kill 1000 scourge. Still saying it's easy?<br />
<br />
But unfortunetly the proc is Le Crap...</div></div><hr />

Well the high end damage must be around 1500-1600, that is nothing to spit at.</div></div><hr />

1)The Lich King is probably the most favored Lore character in WoW.. you must have just joined.<br />

GG Blizz should have just given us Frostmourne nots some shitty Axe knock off.<br />
<br />
<br />
i think they made it worthless for pvp for a reason, pvp weapons already exist, and ICC will be the most current raid out so it will be useful there, and if u take it to cataclysm im sure there will be a purpose for it, i mean we havent even seen the stats or DPS for it yet and everyone is already talkin about how useless it is, yet u all fail to realize that if the proc was something ridiculously OP it would be unfair to classes that cannot use it and it would go back to the same ol preBC sadness where the best pvp weapons were from pve, and thats stupid.</div></div><hr />

No, 25-man raids aren't hard, you don't deserve better gear. People pug them for ****'s sake. If you wanted a truly hard way to get it, it should only be a random chance to drop off Hard-mode Lich King. THAT would be Legendary worthy.<br />
<br />
And of course the proc sucks. The next expansion only goes to level 85, and I'm willing to bet a lvl 80 Legendary will be better than any weapon you'll get outside the 25-man Cataclysm raids. If the proc was too good, it would be even better than 25-man Cataclysm raids for a long time.</div></div><hr />

One blue post doesn't make item with name mimicking Frostmourne legendary. Legendary should have it's legend.

A well stated argument, contrary to the one made by person calling me idiot.<br />
I don't know, perhaps it's me, but I feel like this weapon is very artificial, so &quot;we were supposed to add legendary item for ICC&quot; and story is not convincing either.<br />
<br />
The &quot;creation&quot; of legendary item should have been announced via quests, raid quests, events etc few patches ago, so the &quot;legendariness&quot; could be amassed even before the weapon was actually seen in gamefiles. Instead, Blizzard created it, inserted the model and stated it's Legendary. Few months later they've added this &quot;background&quot; that's as artificial as the weapon itself.<br />

At least they are going back to the &quot;create&quot; your legendary mentality. Having to do chain quests and feats to make it is way better than the silly &quot;pray for your legendary to drop off the boss!&quot; stuff in Black Temple and Sunwell.<br />

Yeah, thats sounds great, use Uther's hammer to kill Arthas. Uther kept to this plan aswell, and what was the result? R.I.P Uther, the Lightbringer. <br />

2)you best be high. t10 is probably blizzards most successful looking tier as a whole.<br />
3)You would be retarded if you ever thought you would be getting ashbringer or frostmourne.<br />
<br />
1)The Lich King is the most favored Lore character in WoW, but the way he is presented till now as the ultimate evil in this game is terrible. If you played this game you would have seen that he's getting smashed wherever we meet him. Argent crusade is humiliating him having games taking place in front of his doorstep etc. Nothing even remotely dangerous or epic about him... Arthas might be the most favored lore character but that's not because of how we see him in wrath of the lich king. If you fail to realise that then you're not very bright.<br />
<br />
2) I'm high and you're not? Have you seen the rogue set? It's ugliest than ugly. Hunter set is terrible as well. Warriors with pigs on their shoulders? Or priest's totally boring unimpressive armor? And ofc lets not forget the lock set. It's an achievement of terribad looks. Ofc this is a matter of personal taste. So if you like disgusting looking things like geists etc, or pigs on your shoulders then i guess you will like these pieces of armor too. Too bad my taste is different.<br />
<br />
3) You are rly rly newb. If you hadn't started playing WoW in WotLK you would have known that the Ashbringer was a legendary that everyone expected in Vanilla. Even Blizzard had the intention to implement it back then. That's proved by certain unfinished quest lines and several other clues you obviously have no idea about. Go get a clue before you write a post the next time</div></div><hr />

If the Shadowmourne would make it's wielder insane or corrupt it's soul, the wielder has to be far more stronger than the Axe itself. Death Knights might have it easy to wield it, since they lost their souls to the Lich King before they were created into Death Knights, but the others might not be so lucky.<br />
<br />
So in order to keep your sanity and your soul, you must order the axe to your will, and not to the axe's will.</div></div><hr />

+ I think blizzard have hit the nail on the head in terms of how you get this legendary, less RNG, more actual challenge to get hold of it. <br />
<br />
I'm interested in the exact detail on the quest chain, will it involve having to kill yogg with a limited number of keepers? etc etc.<br />
<br />
As for the proc, imagine the proc was simply you have a chance to gain 40 str on melee swing, stacks 10 times. That by itself is awesome, just because its coupled by another damage effect that doesn't hit humanoids, suddenly its a crap proc!?</div></div><hr />

<br />
+ I think blizzard have hit the nail on the head in terms of how you get this legendary, less RNG, more actual challenge to get hold of it. <br />
<br />
I'm interested in the exact detail on the quest chain, will it involve having to kill yogg with a limited number of keepers? etc etc.<br />

<br />
<br />
So you think it fits with the lore that the axe you craft to defeat Arthas has a proc that doesn't work against Arthas ...<br />
So you think it fits with the lore that the axe that feeds on souls doesn't work against humanoids ... <br />
<br />
It is a high end PvE item and should work in PvE. If it would be too good in arenas just flag the proc &quot;does not work in arenas&quot; and be done with it. Giving the legendary axe from icecrown a proc that doesn't work against Arthas himself is just ridiculous.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, he is humanoid for sure, and I dont remember him dying....Its kinda strange being an undead without dying.<br />
<br />
Edit: Fixin myself, from wowwiki = &quot;Although Arthas is marked as undead in various sources, it has been confimed by Chris Metzen and Alex Afrasiabi that actually he never died.[4] His undead state may instead refer to the fact that Frostmourne has stolen his soul.&quot;</div></div><hr />

Sorry, hunters. Looking at the newly-released specs for Shadow's Edge, the epic 2h axe you get as part of the questline and eventually transform into Shadowmourne, there are only three classes that can wield it: Warriors, Pallies and DKs.<br />

<br />
They want us to reforge the weapon Arthas wielded before he had Frostmourne, in the hope that it will provide an advantage, because the Ebon Blade believes we should fight fire with fire. Thats pretty damn good lore there that makes sense.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Call me an idiot, but I can't see where this says doen't work on humanoids (the proc), unless there was a previous version out there. Even the proc aside, the stats on this more then make it worthy of getting (this might change once we see what the heroic 25 man weapons are like, but I still think it will be hands down better).<br />
<br />
<br />
IMO, they have done a nice job of creating the lore behind this, creating a new legendary instead of putting together an old one. No, we will never get Ashbringer, lorewise it's only a little bit less powerful then Frostmourne, which is the source of much of Arthas current power. Game is easy enough already tyvm, please don't get them to make weapons that can 2 shot final bosses.<br />
<br />
As for all the other legendary weapons that we have been able to get, reason we can use them and not 2 shot things is they were broken, and we needed to reforge them, so they can always claim that some of their power was lost when they were shattered (Warglaives and the bow being an exception, but neither of those were really powerful to begin with in terms of other legendariy weapons, the weilder always had other artifacts that boosted his power).</div></div><hr />

old version was only to undead/demon/elemental targets, but higher damage<br />
<br />
anyone who says this is crap is fooling themselves, 400 str buff, 50 dps higher than ICC 25 man heroic 2h weapons, massive stats, 3 RED sockets... this is king, period.</div></div><hr />

Can't wait to see videos of warriors slapping around with it. (Not saying warrs should get it, I just play one).<br />
<br />
I'm not a big fan of the artwork though, I guess they mean it to be similar to Frostmourne due to the story, in which case it is.</div></div><hr />

It is a PvE based weapon. The weapon is made to combat the Lich King and his minons. None the less the top end damage alone is amazing and then adding in 3 Str Gems so for a none JC your talking 283 Str. I wonder if the 40 Str Proc is per soul fragment or just 40 no matter how many you gain.<br />
<br />
Also silly as this is, makes me wish shamans had a 2 hander build and could use that. Winfury Proc on it would be scary.</div></div><hr />

and how do u know that.......................... <br />
<br />
all that i am saying, since vanila wow, all that ppl (that love lore) wanted is to battle arthas and get frostmourne.......... after all w8ing all that we get is an axe!!!!! <br />
<br />
and story behing this axe is so poor.......... its another blizz fail.....<br />

its clear that weppon have very good stats, but its not only that that makes one weppon, legendary!<br />

<br />
1 soul fragment = 40str<br />
<br />
when 10 soul fragments, dmg proc<br />
<br />
So having 9 soulfragments is equal to 360str<br />
<br />
getting 558 str from just one weapon sucks yes, with JC gems even 648 str, which is like 750 fully buffed with talents etc...<br />
<br />
on average during you will still have 180 strength extra due to the proc, which is like an additional berserking proc<br />
<br />
(btw i dont know if someone brought this up, i just read the first page and /facepalm)<br />
<br />
including the 3.70 speed, the awesome strength and dps, this will surely be BiS for every dk/warr/pala out there...</div></div><hr />

i played WCIII and instead of getting all orgasmic in wow over the thought of having that sword I recalled what happend to Arthas when he took it. I began, and still do, why anyone would want such a demonic sword? <br />
<br />
and for the axe, it must have some lineage with frostmourne as it is called Shadowmourne. Just imagine what would happen if this axe and that sword fused as one or were both in the hands of a fury warrior. I bet they're like the alpha and omega of legendaries and not even the dragons could stop the warrior O.O</div></div><hr />
