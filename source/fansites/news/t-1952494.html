FEEDBACK: Eye of Azshara (Normal)<br />
We will be opening the Eye of Azshara dungeon on Normal difficulty shortly.<br />
<br />
Please use this thread to post any feedback on the dungeon. When posting, please note your group composition and any relevant information about the nature of your group (e.g. random LFG group, Mythic raider guildmates, etc.). At this stage, a lot of overall combat balance is in flux, but we're still very interested in hearing overall feedback and impressions of the experience and mechanics.<br />

[Feedback] Beastmastery Hunter<br />
Entirely too much focus on Random Beasts, not enough on our actual pets<br />
Since Beast Mastery has been unlocked, this has been the strongest point of feedback, and we've heard you, loud and clear.<br />
<br />
Coming soon will be a glyph that makes Dire Beast summon your stabled pets, instead of random area-themed beasts. We're also considering a talent that replaces Dire Beast with a new shot, and are interested in feedback and ideas on that concept.<br />
<br />

Aura of Sacrifice / Divine Shield Interaction<br />
Aura of Sacrifice is not intended to deal damage through Divine Shield; this should be fixed in an upcoming build. This will also fix the issue where it kills you if you stand near a &quot;healer&quot; target dummy that does very high DPS to itself.

[Feedback] Shadow Priest<br />
In the vast majority of cases, you'll likely want to enter Voidform as soon as you're able to. However, there are still many cases where it's extremely valuable to be able to delay it until the right time. This includes things like saving burst for a key moment in a fight, or when out questing if you're about to kill the last mob that's in range. Because of this, we're trying out a more flexible, manually-activated Voidform. Feedback on how that feels, whether it's more hassle than it's worth, etc, is quite welcome.

[Feedback] Resto Shaman<br />
Two simultaneous Healing Stream Totems not working is a bug.<br />
<br />
As is Resurgence not working correctly when you take the Queen Ascendant trait; this one should be fixed for the next build. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/402039-feedback-resto-shaman/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/20419274234?page=3#42))<br />
<br />
<br />
Blue Posts<br />
Polls<br />
I don't understand why the blues are continually putting up these random and completely arbitrary polls that mean nothing for the well being of the game. Blizzard, why don't you look at the reaction to your game and understand the discontent that people have with it. Start by bring up some polls that narrow down what people hated about trashran and what they liked about it, that way you can use that information to improve and create new content that will actually cater to what your player base wants.<br />
<br />
It's pretty obvious that garrisons worked, maybe a bit too well. They are wonderful safe havens that allow people to make gold and relax without actually having to play the game, which is kind of counter intuitive. Create a poll narrowing down what people liked about their garrisons and what they didn't like.<br />
<br />
Just some odd suggestions, I expect this thread to be censored and/or moved to the garbage can, but hopefully it resonates for a second<br />
Polls aren't generally meant as a means for collecting feedback. They are designed as a way to engage the community in interesting/entertaining topics. (Hopefully - At least for those who choose to take part.)Feedback occurs on these forums and in the game (among other places) and is ongoing. We read/watch/collect as we go. <br />
<br />
When we have used polls in the past for collecting information it's been done very deliberately and with much care due to the inherent pitfalls polls can present such as a smaller portion of the community taking part or undue weight being put on the results by those who did take time to vote.<br />
<br />
We (in community) spend a lot of time thinking about the need to manage expectations because if we over promise we've failed to deliver. If we under promise, we're not telling people enough of the 'real' news. It's a like walking a slackline (tightrope is so yesterday). We have to maintain balance or at least try to maintain balance.<br />
<br />
I would hope that the devs have better metric tools. They can put in measurements to see what we're doing and use that to see what people are actually doing. Not just complaining about<br />
Yep. They do. We watch for what people are both saying and what they are actually doing in game.<br />
<br />
I assume that Blizzard has some really smart people that can do amazing math with data. I guess they do more than purely look at what people do as Ashran probably would have been really highly rated based off of that metric. (For some of the expansion it was practically required, and the easiest way of getting a reward) It makes me wonder if what people spend the most time doing is related to enjoyment or reward. Eh, I know they probably have a whole team dedicated to looking at many different sets of data to try to find what is enjoyable, not just usage time.<br />
We have some wicked smart people here that can drill down into the data. It's true. As with anything, the data tells a lot of the story, but not the whole story. Being able to understand &quot;why&quot; is also looked into which includes what people are saying. Thus why it's so important to put the two together. We have a much larger pool of information that comes from within the game and the vocal community while passionate enough to speak up, aren't the majority so we have to be careful about how we weight the types of feedback.<br />
<br />
Polls as a tool can be used in many ways. For us, the larger value is more in engaging than getting wide ranging thoughts and opinions.<br />
<br />
There will always those who are fine with &quot;still working on it&quot; and those who aren't and see it as giving something and then taking it away when it doesn't happen. It's not anyone's 'fault'. It's just human nature. It's why the study of human behavior is such a large wide-reaching field and there are so many books on just what makes people tick. But those will never encapsulate what all people want and neither can a poll.<br />
<br />
*Yes, we know what you did last weekend. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/402174-logical-polls/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/20742484875?page=2#26))<br />
<br />
Undead and Forsaken<br />
Could we possibly get new models for the Forsaken and other undead to reflect the race they were prior to becoming undead?<br />
<br />
I highly doubt a huge Tauren would look like a humanoid. And I highly doubt that only Humans can be turned once dead.<br />
<br />
I would love to see models of each race that's playable, have an undead version to them. Well, excluding the Worgen, which aren't a race, but a group of cursed humans. And last time I checked, the Worgen Curse made you immune to the curse of undeath, and yet there are Worgen DKs. I still don't get how that works.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I'd love for us to have the option to select Forsaken as our race, then choose the race which we once were, if we want to pretend there's a backstory to our new character, then customize how that character will look (like we do with the current ones in the human forms they have).<br />
The Forsaken are by and large Lordaeron humans who were raised from death by minions of the Lich King, who were rallied to action by Sylvanas against the Dreadlords Balnazzar, Detheroc, and Varimathras. The Forsaken adventurer that a player would control in Azeroth has a full-featured story that you can experience in their starting area that will help explain the nature of being Forsaken versus being Undead.<br />
<br />
While many races can live in Undeath, these races would not be part of the Forsaken faction of Undead, which is why you don't see them as playable. I would think you would be much more likely to see Undead Death Knights of various races than to ever meet a Tauren who was living in Lordaeron at the time of the death of King Tereneas, which is basically the only possibility of finding a Forsaken that is a Tauren. <br />
<br />
As far as I know, and feel free to correct me, the Forsaken are specifically those Undead Humans and a number of Undead High Elves from Lordaeron and Quel'Thalas who pledged their allegiance to Sylvanas and The Horde following the events of Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne.<br />
<br />
TLDR; Undead doesn't mean Forsaken (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/402054-new-undead-models/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/20742534572?page=1#11))<br />

Patch 6.2.4 Testing<br />
Greetings everyone,<br />
I wanted to provide some insight into the 6.2.4 patch and hopefully, answer outstanding questions you may have regarding features and areas to test.<br />
<br />
In 6.2.4 World of Warcraft will transition to a new Battle.net infrastructure. While this infrastructure change contains a multitude of backend improvements for communication between WoW and Battle.net, there are also a number of changes that will directly affect you. It is our goal to make sure these changes don’t negatively impact existing systems, and functionality remains as it was prior to this migration.<br />
<br />
To help us with this task, we’d like PTR testers to focus on the following areas:<br />
<br />
Social features, including whispers between characters, different Blizzard games, the Battle.net app and other in-game characters.<br />
Realm List functionality.<br />
Authentication, logging in, and security features.<br />
Parental controls.<br />
3rd party add-on functionality.<br />
In-game shop functionality.<br />
Character Boosts.<br />
Faction, Race, and Name changes.<br />
<br />
<br />
Development for patch 6.2.4 is ongoing so there may be issues during testing regarding things like logging in and selecting realms. Random disconnects from Battle.net may also occur. It is important that things of this nature are reported in the forums to help ensure a resolution before 6.2.4 goes live.<br />
<br />
I hope this provides a little more insight into what PTR testers should be on the lookout for in this patch. Thank you all for helping to make World of Warcraft an epic experience time and time again! <br />

Blue Tweets<br />
only time you see calls for someone to be fired is coaches &amp; game designers &quot;My happiness trumps your livelihood!&quot; (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/698175623294881792))<br />
no. People work hard for their money. Asking 65 bucks for a game means people feel entitled to quality.<br />
I've paid $65 for a meal out before. If things don't go well I don't ask that people get fired. I might complain and that's fine. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/698217812968366080))<br />
Hell I've paid hundreds/thousands of dollars to get my car fixed. They often don't do it right and I am mad as hell. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/698218351420510208))<br />
But I just ask them to make it right, I don't insist they fire someone. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/698218420697853954))<br />
So your &quot;I worked hard for this $65 so you should fire someone when I'm not happy&quot; is malarkey. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/698218646254936065))<br />
But I'd guess after that you think two or three times before giving them repeat business eh?<br />
Yes and that's 100% okay to me. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/698219470926385152))<br />

From a designer PoV, what do you think about the legion artifacts forcing people to use a certain kind of fighting style/weapon? Many people built their characters around certain fantasies (mostly roleplayers), and now they are forced to cope with Blizzard's fantasy. No more 2H frost or 2x1h Fury.<br />
A huge challenge of trying to continually improve a game as popular as WoW (and this applies to League to by the way) is the risk that someone won't like a particular change that you make. As a developer it's easy to become paralyzed and not make any changes at all, but that usually ends up being a losing strategy, as players get bored without seeing any updates to the game.<br />
<br />
So while you may not support a particular change, maybe you can get behind the idea that the team is trying out a new idea, and that the idea may be large enough that it can't also support every possible play-style out there.<br />
<br />
I have no particular insight into the dev philosophy at play on Legion -- you'd have to ask those devs. But I am sympathetic with the challenge of trying to do something cool without alienating too many people that wishes you'd do something different but still cool or maybe nothing at all.<br />

Warcraft Movie - Khadgar<br />
IGN talked to Ben Schnetzer (http://www.ign.com/videos/2016/02/17/how-warcraft-is-an-origin-story-for-khadgar), the actor that plays Khadgar in the Warcraft movie. <br />

I don't think they said they were talking for anyone or the majority of anyone? And you're kinda doing the same thing lol. But housing has been somewhat demanded for a while now. I'm shocked they still haven't added it. It's in a lot of MMOs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
HAH!<br />
<br />
Where i come from it works more and more like this: As a new employee you only get temporary working contract for lets say for a year or even just a half. After this year, you'll get another year when you didn't suck. When you actually did or dosuck, its very unlikely to get fired, the company is just waiting for your contract to end and then byebye.<br />
<br />
The unwillingness of companies and staff leader to really fire people who are unable to fulfil their job responsiblities now leads to the situation that ambitious and well performing employees only get temporary contracts as well. Don't even try to find a good appartment for rent with only a temporary working contract here, or you want to get a bank credit for financing a car, forget it.<br />
<br />
To people like Holinka i can only say: Maybe its more fair to really request somebody to get fired when he/she is not performing well often than going like &quot;ok lets just give everybody a temporary contract and when it turns out people dont do well the problem solves itself at some time&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
And to people like you I can only say: Maybe it is absurd to fire people over the opinions of maybe 30 vocal neckbeards that live in their parent's basements and the few 100 that parrot them indiscriminately on the two forums they frequent, and 98% of the players of WOW don't even know exist, or care to find.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Personally, I wouldn't mind a whole castle, what I do mind is being FORCED to become a &quot;commander&quot; when I don't even want to be. Forced to &quot;lead&quot; people when my character isn't even that kind of person(in my mind)... Not to mention whenever I do try and immerse myself to try and be a &quot;commander&quot; I'm quickly reminded this is an MMOrpg and wonder who the hell all the other players are supposed to be.<br />
<br />
In Legion they're making the same mistake by yet again forcing me into some leader role when I don't have control over anything, and all the other players around me are the same so they don't really exist then ;/ <br />
<br />
I try not to spoil anything so I don't know what we can do with the class halls in terms of making it our own but most likely nothing - same with the Garrison.<br />
<br />
The most fun I had in my short time playing WildStar was building my own house, hell I bought a huge house they provided but also started building a big ass tree house above and around that house - it was good fun.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was not commenting on this specific example but on the the general working life developments at least where i live. I think its not wrong to tell that most people feel bad to be responsible for somebody else to lose a job and thats fine. BUT in my opinion people in charge should have the backbone to actively end somebodies employment when the performance is insufficient (a most likely pretty rare case) in favor for the many who just do well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can't talk about majorities and minorities just from your personal experiences and reads. It's just confirmation bias.<br />
<br />
There are millions of WoW players, many currently subbed, many unsubbed with potential to come back because of whatever reasons. As far as knowing opinions about the game goes, between forums, friends and other means you *maybe* have access to a few hundred people's opinions. Even if a few thousands, that's still a very small sample of the playerbase, and very likely a subset of the playerbase (people who are unhappy and go to forums to complain, or just overall people who are invested enough in the game/franchise to use these places) which doesn't really match everyone else.<br />
<br />
So if there's one thing certain is any &quot;statistics&quot; you might be able to get out of here do not necessarily reflect the whole playerbase.<br />
<br />
<br />
Personally I think garrisons (hopefully better made, but even in the current state) simply match Warcraft in general and even WoW much better than normal style of playerhousing many other MMOs have. If anything I'd like to have guild halls, not so much player housing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The issues with Ashran are not just '30 neckbeards&quot;. And, most of Holinka's criticism comes directly from his attitude, and his statements that go counter to what player's actually experienced in content he is directly responsible for. Ashran was an utter failure, by any measure. <br />
<br />
I highly doubt the PvP community is only 2% of the player base, and I guarantee you most players have a passing knowledge of how confused and flawed Ashram was from day one - it's been a topic of comment since WoD was in beta.<br />

<br />
I tend to agree. The garrison was the right level of customization in terms of function. I think placing individual chairs or decorations like DCUO's player housing is a bit much - and being this garrison was not meant to follow you long-term it was not the right place for that level of customization. After all, this is a Military Garrison, not your home.<br />
<br />
I do feel the Art was part of the problem - forcing people to use just Human or Orc looks hurt it a bit. I think it might have been nicer if, at least going forward in the expac we were given other &quot;skins&quot; for our garrison. Want it to look Pandaren? Night elf? Troll? Aces, you can do that. Maybe you help a Pandaren brewmaster seeking some rare ingredients for his beer, and in exchange, his companion, an architect, helps you. Maybe the Kirin Tor's portal gets shifted to Darnassus, and you help Furion hold off a giant Plant invasion there and he gifts the plans to you. That level of customization would have made it feel more personal. I could understand launching with just the human art, but we should have had at least two minor patches with two racial arts each. Now, if I were doing it, all your buildings would have the same theme - all Troll, all Orc, all Pandaren, ect. I don't think mix-and-match works here (and I personally hate how the Horde Enchanting hut looks Troll, it looks out of place).<br />
<br />
The garrison's biggest problem in terms of function was it gave you little reason to leave it. Not that it provided too much function, but that the functions it served were only available there (or in Stormshield, a tiny out of the way island). I couldn't do missions anywhere, I had to be in my garrison. I couldn't salvage anywhere but my garrison. I couldn't gather my mining/herb garden anywhere but my garrison. Most of that should have been automated or available via menu like how missions are in STO. <br />
<br />
The bottom line for my experience is that unless you're very dedicated to resource gathering the garrison doesn't provide engaging enough play to keep you around for the long lulls between content. I am hopeful the changes in Legion in the follower system will get people more engaged in the world, and make the work you do feel more special.</div></div><hr />

Point? Yeah this is WOW &quot;the greatest ever MMO that's ever been, is, and ever will be&quot;..... Yet there are a few free to play MMOs out there that just kick WOW's butt in the player housing department. Its not just a little bit here and a little bit there ass kicking. Its the 5 year old trying to fight Mike Tyson butt kicking. <br />
<br />
One of the issues with WOW and its a glaring one. Is that they make content. Then *poof* its forgotten and left. Garrisons and the Pandaria farm are a good examples. Here we have two items that took how much time to develop? Then poof all that work is forgotten next expansion. <br />
<br />
Why didn't they improve, expand, and keep fleshing out either? <br />
<br />
Why wouldn't you want the section of the player base that wants player housing to be happy have it as much as the raiders base? Its a win for both. As both keep paying their subs and keep the game alive...</div></div><hr />

One of the issues with WOW and its a glaring one. Is that they make content. Then *poof* its forgotten and left. Garrisons and the Pandaria farm are a good examples. Here we have two items that took how much time to develop? Then poof all that work is forgotten next expansion. <br />
<br />
Why didn't they improve, expand, and keep fleshing out either? <br />
<br />
Why wouldn't you want the section of the player base that wants player housing to be happy have it as much as the raiders base? Its a win for both. As both keep paying their subs and keep the game alive...<br />
<br />
Well yes, that's the idea. They weren't meant to follow you. And they did flesh out the Pandaria farm in the Mine and Herb Garden in the garrison.<br />

I wonder if there will anything precise about Elune in this book. She's been ignored a lot in the last years.<br />
<br />
I'm sure there will be - maybe we'll get a clarification of her powers.<br />
<br />
I am REALLY excited for this book. I want this, Beta Access and the PTR up ASAP.</div></div><hr />

Where i come from it works more and more like this: As a new employee you only get temporary working contract for lets say for a year or even just a half. After this year, you'll get another year when you didn't suck. When you actually did or dosuck, its very unlikely to get fired, the company is just waiting for your contract to end and then byebye.<br />
<br />
The unwillingness of companies and staff leader to really fire people who are unable to fulfil their job responsiblities now leads to the situation that ambitious and well performing employees only get temporary contracts as well. Don't even try to find a good appartment for rent with only a temporary working contract here, or you want to get a bank credit for financing a car, forget it.<br />
<br />
To people like Holinka i can only say: Maybe its more fair to really request somebody to get fired when he/she is not performing well often than going like &quot;ok lets just give everybody a temporary contract and when it turns out people dont do well the problem solves itself at some time&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Where I'm from, the real world that is, people don't get fired on grounds of some geeks crying over choices made for a fucking video game.</div></div><hr />

So there's that. If I want to play house; I'll fire up Skyrim.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We just got garrisons that isolated us from the outside world, if that taught us anything is that it's a bad idea to isolate players from the world.<br />
<br />
Guild housing would make more sense, instanced in major city of your choice with a teleport, features unlocked only with activity from guild to make sure it's an active guild with many members. I'm going to guess that's what Blizzard wanted to do and go with class halls to make sure people who for some reason are not in a guild would not be left out...</div></div><hr />

Now if they would just give us small pistols and I'll be a happy man. Really excited for the Chronicle can't wait to get it and get some answers to things in the lore that they never explained. The whole lore is what I really enjoy about the game.</div></div><hr />

Just random curiosity brought me here (&quot;I wonder what WoW's doing these days?&quot;) Have to admit, that pally flail looks badass :D<br />
<br />
Can kinda picture it with the last decent transmog set I had before leaving (basically this with that flail) looking awesome :)<br />
