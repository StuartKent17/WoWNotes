Raid Testing Schedule - April 29-30<br />
This Wednesday and Thursday, we will continue our Hellfire Citadel raid testing. As is always the case with PTR raid testing, it is quite possible that there will be technical or gameplay issues that disrupt our plans. Thank you in advance for your patience and understanding.<br />
<br />
Remember that Heroic difficulty scales for any group size between 10 and 30 players, so feel free to assemble and bring a group of any size within that range. Our general plan is to test every encounter on Heroic difficulty first, and then test sections of the raid on Normal and Raid Finder, alongside targeted Mythic tests.<br />
<br />
Each encounter should be available at approximately the listed times below on all PTR servers.<br />
<br />
Wednesday, April 29<br />
<br />
Hellfire High Council - Heroic Hellfire Citadel - 13:30 PDT (16:30 EDT, 22:30 CEST)<br />
Mannoroth - Heroic Hellfire Citadel - 15:00 PDT (18:00 EDT, 24:00 CEST)<br />
<br />
Thursday, April 30<br />
<br />
Hellfire Assault - Heroic Hellfire Citadel - 13:30 PDT (16:30 EDT, 22:30 CEST)<br />
Socrethar the Eternal - Heroic Hellfire Citadel - 15:00 PDT (18:00 EDT, 24:00 CEST)<br />
<br />
After the conclusion of our final Thursday test, we will open the Halls of Blood Raid Finder wing (Council, Kilrogg, and Gorefiend), and we plan to leave that wing active through the weekend. There will be no scheduled Friday testing.<br />
<br />
As always, this testing schedule is very fluid and subject to the realities of a PTR environment. We might have to change the time of a testing session, change the boss being tested, or cancel a test entirely, due to bugs, server hardware issues, etc. Keep an eye on this forum for the latest information, and thank you in advance for testing and providing feedback.<br />

Skill Cap and Ratings<br />
The only way to achieve high ratings as a good player is to play with other good players. However, you will never be able to improve your rating achievements unless your entire team gets better together.<br />
I'm having a hard time seeing how that's a bad thing. Perhaps I'm misunderstanding your post, but it sounds like you're saying that one good player should be able to carry two bad players to top ratings. If that's the case, we just don't agree.<br />
<br />
1. You're completely missing the point that lowering the skill cap actually deters high rated players from playing with low rated players because of that reason.<br />
Yeah, this is the part of your post I don't get. I'm not seeing why you think that's the case. If the game is made easier for low-rated players, wouldn't that just mean the one highly-skilled player on the team has less work to do?<br />
<br />
2. It's a bad thing when really great players can outplay the other team hard and NOT be rewarded for that outplay.<br />
Agreed. I just don't think that that reward needs to be &quot;able to win regardless of what my teammates are doing.&quot;<br />
<br />
3. It's MUCH harder to climb the ladder unless you play with high ranked players.<br />
It is much easier to earn high rating if you play with highly-skilled players, yes. Again, I'm not seeing the problem. (Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/17083949682?page=2#27))</div></div><hr />

No barn needed now?<br />
<br />
Seems that way :-O<br />
<br />
Althought I have just built a barn in preparation for 6.2 specifically for &quot;Felblood&quot; (as it was called then) farming, I think they might have made a good change here. Ever since everyone has their own personal mine and garden that they can plunder regardless of their professions, gathering professions have been close to useless. Forcing players to take a specific garrison building just for a material that everyone needs is kind of gimmicky. I'm not too sad about this. I might just go fishing again, or herbing/mining on my druid.<br />
<br />
Still would be nice if the barn would be one of the several possible sources for the stuff.</div></div><hr />

I do think it's still going to be 6.2 when the anniversary rolls out, but that tidbit doesn't mean anything, just that the guy who has that task in his schedule had time to do it.</div></div><hr />

I guess it's only fitting that we end the expansion in the same way we started it... and had in the middle... I suppose there always [could] be something else coming, but I would call this a wrap for 6.2 content and (hopefully) WoD.</div></div><hr />

The version of Spell Lock that Felhunters use is technically a different ability than the version granted to the Warlock through Grimoire of Sacrifice, due to the way Sacrifice works behind the scenes, and they don't have a shared cooldown.<br />
<br />
I don't think we're particularly worried about this trick in terms of overall balance, but I can bring it up with the dev team again.<br />

<br />
Whats with the use of the word &quot;correctly&quot;? As opposed to &quot;incorrectly&quot;? A blue just said it has been working correctly by not sharing a cooldown for ages, and now it's suddenly correctly not sharing it. o.O<br />
<br />
Trying to lower the QQ by making it look like a fix instead of a nerf?</div></div><hr />

Course they dumbed down crafting even more and made the legendary quest easier cause it's oh so hard to do the final step after all. Smh<br />

Ehhh I'd see it mostly as them fixing an oversight. I highly doubt it was intended for us to be able to double interrupt like that, so I would call it more of a big fix than a nerf. A NERF would be them increasing the CD on the Felhunters inturrupt....<br />

<br />
At a guess, I'd say the Hellfire Citadel ones were for each wing of the LFR verion of the raid, and TBC/Wrath ones are for the background of the LFG menu during timewalking weekends.<br />

The nerf doesn't make sense, at least half of it. &quot;Reduced health&quot; on the mobs has no point. They die in one hit when you use Garonas ability on them, which is the only way you can attack them, what purpose does reducing their health serve?</div></div><hr />

LFR ilevel 655, this can't be right... isn't that BRF(lfr) ilevel on the gear?<br />
<br />
BRF LFR is ilvl 650. A +5 ilvl boost seems pretty good to me considering the difficulty level of LFR.</div></div><hr />

Unless Blizzard has since corrected the issue, it's not always a one-hit KO. It's also helpful for classes with long interrupt CDs.<br />
<br />
The part I'm happiest about, though, is the reduction in the number of guards in the area. The place was so packed that it was very difficult to deal with any of the pats.<br />
<br />
However... &quot;An Inside Job&quot; should never have been implemented as it was. I think it's quite telling, in that regard, that the majority of those who completed it had to engage in behavior that was antithetical to the nature of the quest. I personally spent over an hour trying different paths, killing different guards, using my zone CD, patiently waiting between pats... All for nothing, every time. It wasn't challenging; it was stupid gameplay that turned the experience into wanting to smash something. I finally said #%^@ it, made my way to the second scaffolding attached to an outcropping, jumped up to a safe point, logged out, logged in, mounted up, and zerged both quest objectives. Took only several minutes.<br />
<br />
Blizzard messed up this legendary quest good.</div></div><hr />

They indicate a Timewalker event for respective dungeons of that expansion.<br />
Guess Cataclysm and Mists of Pandaria will be added at a future date.</div></div><hr />

I still have some keys left, was planning to go in at level 100 for the achievement and not have to worry about the trash. I'm afraid I'll never be able to make all those super mario jumps in time though, I wish there was a way to practice it without wasting the last keys I'll ever have.</div></div><hr />
