The result will likely be less token sales, the flowing of gold out of garrisons has to be helping foster token sales. I won't have to pay real money for a long long time as it stands now</div></div><hr />

This right here. This is what an MMO should be about. They do not get it at all. I can't do jack shit with my friends leveling up. My level 100 can't do shit with a level 90. My friend who wants to get to level 60 so they can get the professions are alone until they hit 60.<br />

You do realize that blizzard benefits from tokens?They make 20 euros per token sold instead of 13,5. Thats 6 and a half euros pure profit for the same amount of game time</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solvaran</div><div class="date">2015-06-13, 09:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Questions and answers are better than I thought. They seem to grasp some of the major issues with WoD. That said, I really disagree with the Time Walking dungeon holiday window. Really, really disagree with it. I think they completely missed the mark for all but raids regarding the mix off effort/reward/fun/engagement. <br />
<br />
The gold from garrisons is the only reason I am currently subscribed. If they nerf that (which probably needs to happen, it is ridiculous!), then some folks will go off of tokens and just cancel the account if the rest of WoD isn't compelling enough. Right now, and from what I see of 6.2, it isn't engaging enough to justify my $15/mo. So, token or nothing for the rest of WoD for me. In fact, during the interview, I just subbed for 6 mos for FF XIV after playing it for 7ds so far and bought a security token as well. WoD is so lacking (for me), that after 10+ of WoD and 7 or 8 max level toons (and more sitting at 90!), I'm done until they show me that they care more about non-raid content (like dungeons and end game quests that support story, for cryin' out loud!).</div></div><hr />

Yes. I was reading someone's comment about how the dungeons in BC/LK often used a lot of the raid assets and story concept. Imo, that was a great approach to story telling, immersion, and also saves on development costs. But they seem to be against releasing new dungeons (i.e. raid tier vs. new dungeons). Sigh.</div></div><hr />

Give it a rest, it's not like you need to be able to fly it's just a convenience thing that you'll quickly get bored with anyway; You only have to log on for a small amount of time each day and you can easily just not do it one day. How about you learn some self-control and just get it slower than everyone else?

I think the point was that some other mmo's allow you to progress your character while running lower level content with friends while also not completely trivializing the content for both you and the other players. That's not important gameplay to you, perhaps, but it is significantly improved game play for others.</div></div><hr />

Back up two steps. Do you not understand what an MMO is about? Ideally I should scale down to the dungeon.<br />
<br />
I KNOW I can powerlevel people. I have 11 toons, one of each class. Lowest level is 95. Nearly all at 100.<br />
I probably know more about powerleveling than you'll ever know. I sat and did the math on which dungeons and how. Timed the speeds, plotted an Excel spreadsheet and boom. Simple math. Not hard.<br />
<br />
This doesn't address it's an MMO. Just scale us down to basically full blue's at the iLvl and let us queue for the highest level dungeon we have in that group. I'm not asking for the *dungeon* to be scaled, I'm asking for *me* to be scaled.</div></div><hr />

No that was actually a very, very good Q&amp;A. We saw a very reflective Ion that evidently had a lot on his mind, it's clear he realises Blizzard have made some massive mistakes with this expansion and the 2 before. This is good for the game. He won't want to be in that situation again. That was clear.</div></div><hr />

Since you only really need to run four to five heroics for the legendary and then they stop being useful for gear progression (then move on to LFR, raids), they really killed heroic dungeons this expansion. Valor/badges kept them relevant in the past. I always thought you should be able to get valor for doing 7 runs per week vs. 1 run per day, but they seem really, really fixated on logging in each day. Reward folks for running dungeons as many times as they want to, just cap rewards weekly as opposed to daily.</div></div><hr />

Flying was a hard decision for the team. People believe that they were lying to players, but the reality is that it is a large design team and it was a decision made by the team as a whole. People were on both sides of the issue and with Patch 6.2 being on the PTR it was a time to make a decision. The majority of the team decided to never allow flying, but the player feedback made the team consider flying again and come up with a compromise that they were happy with.<br />
<br />
And meanwhile they left players going at each others throats over completely subjective matters like &quot;Is it immersive??&quot; and &quot;Is it lazy??&quot; or &quot;Can it be enjoyed JUST FOR THE SAKE OF FLYING??&quot; for ages...<br />
<br />
Hoping this has taught them once and for all to not create scapegoats and problems where there are none to be had. Guess what, the people WANTING to skip content might do all the tasks needed for flight from now on, but will they enjoy it more because you shove it down their throats? No. Meanwhile someone like myself will do and enjoy the content where possible and enjoy that extra level of immersion that flying brings to ME. Since I don't use flight as a mode of convenience, I'm not even staggering my leveling of alts through Draenor in order to wait for flight.</div></div><hr />

Not me, no. I don't make my gold from them now and don't plan to either since I am fed up with everything Garrison. Was planning to have about 5 characters with rosters made up of only treasure hunters, but decided my sanity couldn't take that. I prefer the crafting and AH game then + the loads of gold that Cataclysm raids give. <br />
<br />
Generally speaking for the people that have no other real means of making gold? Maybe, but they can always remove gold missions to solve that and give them a different way in the next expansion. Simple.</div></div><hr />

People seem to conveniently forget just how popular the game became through Classic and TBC...did those expansions have much more complex and higher skill caps in terms of rotations?<br />

Yep. Lore was there for the sole purpose of making Ion's spin sound legit by sometimes &quot;rephrasing&quot; the canned, cherry-picked questions, and have his nose as far up Ion's ass as possible. That's why with Ion, they hired a former attorney instead of an actual game dev.</div></div><hr />

I don't mean everyone is leaving because of that. I meant I'm seeing everyone in my circle (guild/friends) quitting because of that. A ton of mythic raiders are bored with how the classes are and are quitting because of it. I was holding out hope they'd revert, but it looks like they're not done butchering. If your circle of friends just does LFR or levels alts then I doubt you'd be seeing the same results. <br />
<br />
It's not just mythic raiders leaving the game, the butchering of the skill cap is making pvpers leave as well. The classes are just not fun right now and they're telling us it will be getting worse.</div></div><hr />

The delay on communication about flying after the decision in the interview was because the discussion was ongoing.<br />

This is really where I call bullshit. They made a definitive statement to the press. There was NO indication there was still a 'discussion&quot; going on about it, none.

This is really where I call bullshit. They made a definitive statement to the press. There was NO indication there was still a 'discussion&quot; going on about it, none. They sent out the CMS to defend the decision. There was no attempt made by them at all, in any way, to indicate the issue was unresolved. NONE.<br />

They dont care if this or that is wrong with it , it simply HAS to go out before june 30th .<br />
At june 30th the second quarter 2015 closes , so they need to boost their numbers .<br />
Lets hope is a bit balanced , because once its out they tend to not care anymore .<br />
Proof on that is the dps balance of last patch . Just look at logs .</div></div><hr />

With how he answered those questions, that they feel MORE ability pruning needs to be done and rotations need to be less complex that settles it for me. I'm cancelling. Joining many others. The skill cap right now is WAY too low and they're planning on making it even worse. Pathetic. Destroying a once great game.<br />
<br />
They undoubtedly have data on how well people are doing the &quot;dumbed down&quot; rotations. And the data are almost certainly telling them that people are, by and large, NOT doing them very well. He basically said as much, comparing the performance of players in top guilds to average players.<br />

They seem to be on the ball about the stuff that is wrong with WoD. I'm glad they figured out they went to the extreme from MoP to WoD when it comes to dailies, outside world content, professions, etc, but:<br />
<br />
I'm not sure I like what I'm hearing about alts.<br />
I'm absolutely floored they where actually going to never allow flying. I guess I never actually wanted to believe they would do it, especially with selling cash shop flying mounts and a few rewards in WoD are flying mounts. I guess they wanted those of us who like flying to keep paying and stay in old content?<br />
Didn't beta testers try to warn them about a lot of these things?<br />
<br />
I'm getting the impression they are now actually listening more to feedback. A little bit of my faith has been restored.<br />

Them maybe MMOs are not the game for you then? The point of any game is to get what you put into it, and Blizzard does a really good job at making sure you get plenty even if you can only log in for an hour or so each day. If three weeks of doing dailies to unlock exaulted with a faction is considered too much time to spend then you would hate some of the rep grinds in other games.</div></div><hr />

People believe that they were lying to players, but the reality is that it is a large design team and it was a decision made by the team as a whole. People were on both sides of the issue and with Patch 6.2 being on the PTR it was a time to make a decision. The majority of the team decided to never allow flying, but the player feedback made the team consider flying again and come up with a compromise that they were happy with.<br />

I still maintain that they were told by the higher ups to reverse the decision, over sub losses.<br />

Personally, this &quot;compromise&quot; seems silly and I'm not likely to &quot;work&quot; for it and with how they are breaking PvP, have broken PvP, and are destroying garrisons -- they've solidified me quitting.<br />

And even more interesting even though the no flying side of the dev team won they still had to add in flying against their own wishes and desires, because of the dissent within the playerbase.. But yes will be interesting to see how the game goes if you have such a fractured dev team as they seem to have now..</div></div><hr />

You're right -- I'm going to quit when my sub runs out and then leave. That's what got them to their senses in Cata in to MoP. and from MoP into late MoP. Ah well. Been downhill since Wrath.<br />
<br />
The problem is there ARE MMO's out there that are becoming on par. With WoW removing all this stuff or bringing back BC level grinds nearly, they are becoming the same MMO that everyone else is -- only *slightly* more polished right now.

Its fun to see when others can't take critizism on what they say, but have no problem giving it to others.<br />
<br />
None of us, us meaning the poeple in this forum and other fansite forums that may also be complaining, know what is going on at Blizzard HQ any given day. The only thing that can happen is speculation.<br />
<br />
So many people want vanilla and TBC servers back, but I think they honestly forgot how grindy the game was back then. Reps that could only be farmed in certain, heroic level, instances that you would have to run once a day for a month or more to complete. Open world factions like the Shatarii Skyguard, and Netherwing that toom months to complete by doing the dailies that were spread all over Outland. The game now is so mich easier than it was then, and there are still a very loud minority that say it is too hard, or there isn't enough time. It is sad.</div></div><hr />

Portals in Cataclysm made the world feel smaller. The Group Finder added in Warlords is an improvement over random matchmaking, adding some social aspect back while avoiding spending an hour looking for a group in town.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure if Ion has ever used this feature if that's what he thinks. I've spent aeons applying to groups in the finder at peak times. I'm sure it's possible to get a quick invite to the later bosses if you're an i700 healer, but if you're melee DPS and you don't want to spend two hours clearing the 7 bosses you already killed this week again for no chance at anything but additional repairs, then you'll be spending those hours hoping a tank takes pity on you, whether as a raid leader or as someone who joins your 0/0/1 party.</div></div><hr />

Lol holy shit I'm losing braincells reading this. Some of us have been playing the game for twice as long, and we aren't shills like you. When you have a life, a job, and money, and you've been playing a game like WoW this long and they decide to do some seriously stupid shit that is unacceptable to the standards set before, we go and play something else and leave it at that. This game is already at vanilla level subs, and its only going to go lower next quarter. The only one here who is acting like a 12 year old is you. Nobody else is writing like you are.

So your logic is that because there are no other mmos that are good we HAVE to keep playing? Really? You thought of this and then typed it out and then hit submit? Mind boggling. Yes there is a guy here with a gun to my head telling me he'll kill me if I don't play an mmo. So since this is the best one I have no choice.

Outside of World PvP and druids ganking resources, other people flying has no negative affect on those players who hate flying.<br />
<br />
And, in those two instances:<br />
1) World PvP has been in a rut for years, mostly because World pvp more or less = ganking and numbers&gt;all, and has since Vanilla<br />
2) You don't need to farm resources with the garrison.<br />
<br />
Other than that, there is no reason why people who dislike flying can't stay on the ground.</div></div><hr />

You can get a drop from rare mobs in Tanaan that gives you +1000 rep for all Draenor factions.<br />

Because their team doesn't think clearly apparently. The biggest criticism of Blizz the last few expansions has been their lack of balance. They swing wildly one way and then wildly another way. I'm not sure why they don't understand that there's a happy middle ground they should be looking for instead of their current all or nothing approach.</div></div><hr />

Whats worrying is that all these issues were predicted widely by players before the expansion even launched, bliz said &quot;no its great in game&quot;....which turned out to be incorrect. Its nice bliz now acknowledge that, its worrying they thought these things were good ideas in the first place.</div></div><hr />

Right, because trying to teleport to rare mobs to farm those tokens is going to work out so well. Remember that lazy BS they gave us in 5.4 called Timeless Isle? This is the same thing except people will literally jump directly to the rares instead of having to run/fly there. Should be tons of fun.</div></div><hr />

It is a nerf, but alleviates some of of the pressure to have many alts. It is a problem when it scales linearly and having six characters gives you six times the amount of gold, making you feel like you have to log into them all every night.<br />
<br />
Boy, I am REALLY not likely the sound of this. <br />
<br />
I realize it's just me, but I have a lot of alts because I want them, not because I feel like I have to have them. That said, I don't feel like I have to log into them all every night either.

<br />
The other reason I don't like the sound of this is is because while a person with 6 alts might reap a reward x6, alts are damned expensive too. If Blizzard goes with diminishing returns, are there also going to be diminishing costs to go along with it?

He's talking about garrison missions, not quests.<br />

IE, logging in on 6 alts to send treasure hunter followers on 100g reward missions to earn 1200~2400g a day per account doing basically nothing. Given that WoW tokens only run about 24k, I can understand why that would be a concern.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, not really. The end result admits of gradations. Actively striving to make it the worst spec (different from redressing balance issues) certainly is the wrong attitude to take towards it, because it will virtually guarantee it. If you're saying the end result will be the same irrespective of approach, then what purpose do the designers serve exactly? Can they not influence outcomes in their own game? Whether it is for PVE or PVP, some people just like the spec; so it is a massive slap in the face of those people to hear them take such an approach. <br />
<br />
Needless to say, I'll continue refraining from playing a warlock, until they get a clue about where they'd like to take destro and demo.</div></div><hr />

I get you, but I still don't like the sound of it. A) It's a slippery slope. B) If I have 6 alts and I did what I had to do get 3+ treasure hunters so that I was able to get 1500g on the Blingtron's Secret Vault mission whenever it pops (which I don't believe can possibly be more than once a week at best), then so what?  In that scenario I probably dropped over 100K to get 6 tier 3 garrisons in the first place. Gotta spend money to make money, so let me make it. I fail to see how it ruins anyone else's fun. Anyway, Blizzard isn't saying that it does, they're just worried about me ruining my own fun? C'mon.</div></div><hr />

There's a &quot;worst&quot; spec for each class. Always. That will never change. That doesn't mean bad. Worst ≠ Bad. I think you're taking it to mean it's intentionally bad which is not at all what he said.</div></div><hr />

This comment really makes me wonder what they are doing sometimes and not thinking things out all the way. What did they expect to happen? You add in an ability for followers to get more gold on gold missions, allow you to recruit them in the inn, and players wouldn't stack them? Sometimes i think that they do things just so a select few (themselves or friends or certain guilds) can get ahead then Nerf it so those mentioned can concentrate on the raiding.</div></div><hr />

Since you only really need to run four to five heroics for the legendary and then they stop being useful for gear progression (then move on to LFR, raids), they really killed heroic dungeons this expansion. Valor/badges kept them relevant in the past. I always thought you should be able to get valor for doing 7 runs per week vs. 1 run per day, but they seem really, really fixated on logging in each day. Reward folks for running dungeons as many times as they want to, just cap rewards weekly as opposed to daily.<br />
<br />
I don't think I did any heroics in MOP. Didn't see the point of them. The ones in WOD only if I needed to advance a quest line for which it was what one? I considered doing doing some for the inn toys but the thing that turns me off is the long ass queue times for DPS role. Yeah I could switch to tank or healing but Pally healing seems under powered or I just suck. Or I could go back to tanking but ugh... have to put up with the GOGOGOGOGO crowd or random YOU SUCK OMG I pulled the mobs and you were way over there but I died crowd.</div></div><hr />

After the initial interview, the player and team feedback made them reconsider flying.

They prefer to see alts exist to serve themselves. You should have a healer alt because you want to heal, or another class PvP alt because you want to PvP as that class. The progression for each character should be on that character. Multiple alts shouldn't exist to serve your main character.<br />
<br />
This is the biggest problem with this dev team. You design the game. You don't EVER get to tell me what I find FUN. I like leveling alts, and the reasons are my own. If I want to take a naked level 1 and go exploring, and I find that FUN, why would you CARE? <br />
<br />
I find having a team of support alts a billion times more FUN than one Garrison. <br />
<br />
And they STILL don't get how much damage their Facebook App-GARRISONS has destroyed this expansion. Not only has it made the world empty, and the followers see more action in the game than players do, but all professions are hollow and boring now. Gatherers can just quit. I love gathering. I find it relaxing and FUN. They've taken that away. I won't even get into what that's done to the economy.<br />
<br />
What game did these new devs come from? Have they ever played WoW? It doesn't seem like it.<br />
<br />
What's next, you're going to make raiding required? Because that's what it seems like. Hey Blizz, there are a LOT of players who don't do any instances of any kind. Is our $15 a month not as good as those that raid?<br />
<br />
Sorry that &quot;most of the dev&quot; team don't like flight. Obviously &quot;most&quot; of your players feel differently, otherwise it never would have come back. <br />
<br />
I can't wait to see the Q2 numbers. I wish we could get snapshots of the day BEFORE the &quot;Flight is coming back (someday-if we can fix it)&quot; announcement, and the day after.<br />
<br />
As much as I'm thankful that flight is (hopefully) returning, the horrid way Blizzard has handled this entire fiasco, the lies (just TELL US you broke controlled flight), the lack of communication, the insane reasons and BS nonsense that intentionally mislead your paying customers.... it's disgusting.<br />
<br />
I know a lot of pro-flight players will come back. But there are a lot who won't since it's not just the flying. It's this entire boring, empty expansion, Blizzard's continued pathetic handling of it, and their complete disrespect, complacency, and lack of interest in their playerbase.</div></div><hr />

what makes that rational even worse is that its as true of Apexis dailies which replaced the 5 man valor grind...they became more trivial as well as you geared up...which just demonstrates that this excuse is, for all intents and purposes, a flat out lie. <br />
<br />
Its really all about the fact that 5 mans take more resources and effort to create. The entire design philosophy in WoD appears to have been how little time and effort Blizzard could get away with.

Don't make up bullshit as you go for why you did things. That entire part about flying just sounds like bullshit. My bigger problem is how they handle inner-class spec balance...basically saying demo has been too strong so now it will be nerfed and they can enjoy the bottom is fucking horrible to come out and confirm that that's how they handle spec balance. While it's overall been obvious, they shouldn't come out and say it. God forbid they just get it right and have specs perform within a 5% difference so you just play what you enjoy.</div></div><hr />

If you listened they are going to rebuild the spec next expansion. Which hey, I'm a Demo lock, but the great thing about pure dps is I have two other specs to use and Demo just won't be the best warlock spec its still going to be a good spec overall especially with its mobility. Will it be the go to warlock spec? Nope, but you can probably passably play it in just about any raid group but cutting edge. Would you rather he just straight lied and said &quot;we think its in a good place and if the numbers show otherwise we'll look at it.&quot; Knowing full well they won't.</div></div><hr />

<br />
that leads to the following chain of speculation:<br />
<br />
- they disallowed to ask that question<br />
- they decided to not select that question from the chat<br />
<br />
that leads to the following assumptions:<br />
- they are not sure and its not decided yet if they put in a small 6.3 (ruby sanctum like stuff or so)<br />
- all plans are fixed. timelines are set. expac date is 90% fixed. (i believe that, cause movie+game &gt; everything for them)<br />
<br />
that leads to the reason why:<br />
- when they have a fixed schedule, they will never confirm that, cause of possible lost subs, after a few weeks of HFC<br />
- instead on the other side, when they are not sure about the patch, they WOULD say &quot;maybe 6.3&quot; to secure subs<br />
<br />
that leads to only 1 reult:<br />
- if they say nothing, and do not choose that question, that means its the last tier and the next expac is fixed.<br />

Blizzard employees must think players are really stupid. There were official announcements made several times that flying would not be implemented. It wasn't until they decided to say flying would never be added to the game going forward that they realized they made a mistake when players got pissed and started unsubscribing.

sad to say, but i have the same feeling. maybe they shouldnt do a wow2 for us, instead they should do it for their devs, so they could be enthusiastic again about working with modern tools, technologies, stories and so on.<br />
<br />
on the other side i think (instead of total fools like holinka or chris zierhut) that ion hazzikostas is a good guy. he thinks most of the time long-termed, has rational statements and also some times agree to failures made by them. also he did a great job when it comes down to raid and boss design. whats the course of blizzard, and what he is allowed to say or do, or not, thats not ions fault. the community should say bye to that naive imagination of a ion or a ghostcrawler steering that great wow ship. thats not how big business works.<br />
<br />
instead blizzards managers and blizzard as a whole should first give devs a reason to have fun making a game, and second they should stop their cash cow milking &quot;put the least effort in, for the most money, and lets see if that morons pay for it&quot; course. but that changes only when enough customers are lost. sad but true.</div></div><hr />

Its really all about the fact that 5 mans take more resources and effort to create. The entire design philosophy in WoD appears to have been how little time and effort Blizzard could get away with.

<br />
what a joke answer. Promised to add flying in 6.1 when they are advertising for WOD during the pre-release, then when WOD hits they &quot;suddenly&quot; decided to not add flying at all n screwing everyone right in the ass. <br />
<br />
of course the devs &quot;as a team&quot; will choose not to add flying, because the workload will be a lot less work for them. Good thing they got hit real hard by the number of players that unsub after their blatant lies, finally they decide to step up n fix their wrongdoings.</div></div><hr />

Questions were carefully selected. There were many questions posted on different topics, including pet battles and many many questions about RPG elements. They didn't touch any of them. <br />
<br />
Instead they focused on things we already know. Whole Q&amp;A was about current state of WoD and patch 6.2, only related to raids, dungeons, quests, class balance and lack of agility weapons from Archimonde. Nothing else. Not a single tough question related to RPG elements or where game is heading.<br />

You didn't do it for nothing, it's just way too rewarding as it is. You will still be able to earn gold from additional garrisons, but it won't be as efficient as it is on your &quot;main&quot; character.<br />

They prefer to see alts exist to serve themselves. You should have a healer alt because you want to heal, or another class PvP alt because you want to PvP as that class. The progression for each character should be on that character. Multiple alts shouldn't exist to serve your main character....<br />
<br />
With this statement right here, I know that NONE OF THE LEAD DEVELOPERS OR ANY ON THAT TEAM HAS PLAYED THIS GAME FOR A LONG TIME PERIOD. IF they have it's more than likely one character or 2 characters and yet a realm can support 11. I want them TO DO 11 GARRISONS A DAY and still stand by that statement. It looks like the &quot;Employees&quot; play for the short term not the long term and probably cheat to 100. Managing 11 Garrisons with the same 25 followers with looting the same items etc, sure it's an option but its one of the options people want to pursue and having the 11th Qina Moonshadow doing the exact same mission does not promote immersion and alienates you from the game. This is the primary reason why I unsubscribed it doesn't make any rhyme or sense.<br />
<br />
When playing on one account we are playing on one character we don't play 11 characters at once unless we multibox all this is gonna do is shower us with loot. I think Blizzard don't even Q&amp;A WOW anymore as you can see. It seems most of their experienced game developers who actually play the game have moved on to Starcraft II, Diablo 3, Hearthstone, Overwatch and Heroes of the Storm. They really need play-testers and now they want us really timesink 2 hrs a day min to get the most out of our characters by looting all the shit. Jesus they are mad.<br />
<br />
It was an easy solution for all this madness which Blizzard cause make garrison one per server, therefore the loot is limited even I don't need a game design degree to figure that out.</div></div><hr />

I'm really not sure how anyone could not have seen a nerf to the gold made from garrisons coming from a mile a way, it's just way too much for no effort, especially when done on multiple characters. (And yes before you ask, I also have several garrisons set up on alts exploiting the shit out of it and no, it wasn't that much work/effort.)<br />

Expect it to be nerfed even further when 7.0 launches.</div></div><hr />

I play in Europe and even now I find the 45K that shitty crappy token costs too much to bear, if they nerfed my gold gain rate like that I would think twice before buying any more tokens for gold. But I guess Bli$$ard doesnt give a FACK because they can secretly just generate Gold as they please for potential Euro to Token buyers... Honestly there are enough games to enjoy out there and WoD has made it easy to kill my Desires and OCDs to keep excessively wasting my prime years in this ruin of a once lovely game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;Mythic is something for people to aspire to. It allows the best players to prove who is the best.&quot;<br />
Nah, I don't think so. We aspire to good players not because it's mythic I think most people could clear it if they had the time and people to get 20 man going. What we care about is the world first race on the highest level. Mythic just happens to be that level.<br />
<br />
I think they are missing a huge part of the demographic by not having 10 man mythic. Heroic 10 man was by far THE most played raid size/level and now all of those players have been either pushed in 20 man and probably broke up already by now or pushed to flex heroic like myself and are NOT having a good time at all.</div></div><hr />

This must be the most honest statement ever done in gaming history. <br />
<br />
Now they're trying to fix that in 6.2 and what they can't, they're nerfing to the ground until next expansion where they will just erase all the problems because xpack is already in works (at least it's what they say). Sorry, that doesn't work. Stop splitting the team between staggered projects. Make the whole team focus on here and now so they can fix failures properly in time. I think that this model of development is the real reason for crap expansions like Cata or WoD mixed with pretty good ones like MoP. It goes like this: crap (Cata) → good (MoP) → crap (WoD) → probably a good one next time.<br />
<br />
And what's been already said here: I don't feel any joy or passion from them. It feels like they're tired with WoW and think about it as a money maker and not an entertaining game. I really think that starting over with WoW2 would be the best solution if they haven't lost their money already (on making next xpack or splitting it between HS and HotS)</div></div><hr />

I took issue with that quote, as well. Mythic might be designed as something for people to aspire to, but he's ignoring the participation numbers. They might intend for it to be something people aspire to, but nobody is aspiring to it. At what point do you realise that, okay, players clearly aren't interested in this, so why are we continuing to develop it?<br />
<br />
Ion rationalised it by saying that it takes up very little development time, but then went on to list all the other things that take up the bulk of development time such as tuning, loot, etc. How many of those other areas would be lighter for having the Mythic element removed? As far as I see it, there are two good options for Mythic - try your suggestion, lower the raid size and see if more people try it, or just cut it altogether.</div></div><hr />

Giving you a bar to fill is more engaging that telling you to actually kill x of mob1, x of mob2, x of mob3 ... you have the freedom to kill as many of mobs 1 2 and 3 as you wish. See that is more fun and not nearly as grindy!</div></div><hr />

Instead, why not just bring destruction and affliction up to demonology's level? Make destruction and affliction just a little more complex, especially destruction. It's boring to just sit there casting mostly 2 spells and the occasional Conflagrate and Chaos Bolt when you get embers, especially if the damage is lackluster compared to other classes. Give destruction an insta-cast proc like the old instant-shadow bolt talent did that shows on screen; a simple on-screen proc indicator can do wonders (like Frost Mage's buffed Ice Lance indicator).</div></div><hr />

<br />
From what I understand, nerfing the complexity is a big enough redesign that they can't do it mid-expansion. They basically admitted they screwed up designing the spec this expansion.<br />
<br />
And if they are planning more across-the-board rotation simplification in the next expansion, changing things now could be seen as a waste of effort.<br />

Having just started playing FF XIV a week a go due to the hot mess WoD is in (well, also the Polygon interview + token f2p), I wonder if they could simplify enough to get WoD on consoles?

I disagree with them as well. However, they probably think that they don't want to make folks with one toon feel that they are severely disadvantaged unless they makes alts. However, if they went this route, they'd need to make much more engaging content to soak up all the time folks with alts spend on their alts. They haven't done this, they won't do this, and if they makes alts have a &quot;penalty&quot;, well, they'll lose a segment of the alt players.<br />
<br />
Anyhow, Bliz has long had a point of view on how they really wanted people to play. For a very long time, it was: <br />
1) one toon (cause &quot;choices should matter!&quot;)<br />
2) one spec (cause &quot;choices should matter!&quot;)<br />
3) no transmog (cause folks need to see how awesome you are cause you're wearing boss xyz's gear!)<br />
4) be in a raid guild<br />
5) raid!<br />
<br />
The focus is really on raiding and the raid gear it provides. Alts are something that happened due to folks wanting something different than that model requires/provides.<br />
<br />
I'm currently giving FF XIV a try due to me not liking WoD and the Bliz interviews over the last 1.5 months. It is interesting in that they kinda push you to have one toon (you can have more if you want), but each toon can have ALL classes and ALL professions if you want, but you have to level each from 1. For each class you learn, you actually become a level 1 in that class, can only wear level 1 gear, etc. You level 50% faster on your lower level class. Having multiple classes allows you to access a few additional abilities from a class (for example, my gladiator now can raise folks due to him also having a lower level healing class... he's going to become a paladin eventually).<br />
<br />
Anyhow, my point in giving the FF XIV example wasn't to promote it, but rather to say if WoW wants to discourage/penalize alts, they need to rethink how they handle mains otherwise folks will run out of stuff to do on mains (it used to be your main had to grind forever for raid mats, thank gods that no longer is the case like vanilla/cata!).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, a bit of exaggeration (levelling was good as well), but yeah. Removing something like valor (i.e. gear progression) killed heroics, bad reps grinds, apexis grids, garrisons too rewarding, Ashran, no-flying at max level (if you're pro-flying), etc. They also made LFR even easier (too easy, imo), which killed any enjoyment/engagement I got from that as well.<br />
<br />
From posts I've seen from raiders, it sounds like raiding guilds are struggling with maintaining rosters as well. So, while raid content (i.e. encounter and environment design) may be good, raid &quot;culture&quot; may be struggling as well (idk... I only pugged raids in BC/LK, and switched to LFR when it came out).</div></div><hr />

Part of the problem, though, and Ion admitted it in the interview, is Bliz tends to be &quot;all or nothing&quot; in design changes. That doesn't lead to healthy choice, that either leads to no choice (i.e. where content is removed), or an obvious choice (where the effort vs. reward system is so out of whack that you only have one &quot;real&quot; choice). Some other newer mmos have cracked this code much better that Bliz has lately.</div></div><hr />

They prefer to see alts exist to serve themselves. You should have a healer alt because you want to heal, or another class PvP alt because you want to PvP as that class. The progression for each character should be on that character. Multiple alts shouldn't exist to serve your main character.<br />

<br />
Don't tell me how to use my account or my alts, Blizzard. I pay my subscription like everyone else and I will do -- within the EULA -- what I damn well please with my characters.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Obviously...<br />
<br />
But there's a difference between a person choosing to play like that, and the developers designing the game with the intention of people playing like that.</div></div><hr />

That was LEAST of hassle, just click click with master plan.<br />
<br />
Real chore starts with daily profession CD, work orders, daily bunker...<br />
<br />
Because why do real fixes? Like:<br />
- make all daily quests/cds weekly<br />
- increase work order queue<br />
- make herb/mine lootable once per week (with x7 gain)<br />
- change follower missions to take days instead of hours (with increased gain)<br />
etc. etc.<br />
<br />
Simple fixes that make garrisons x7 less chore right away and yes I play 7 T3 garrisons atm.<br />
<br />
Absolutely and incredibly obvious. But they won't do this. Part of the issue is that the garrisons take too much time and are boring game play. But another issue is that they are also too rewarding (which, from Bliz's perspective is the real issue... if they were less rewarding, we'd leave the garrisons... which would be true in prior expansions, but not this one, I think, due to other design decisions they've made!).<br />
<br />
But ultimately, they really, really want folks to log in daily. They probably have some study on player retention that leads them to think that non-raiders who log on daily will stay subscribed more than folks who log on 2-3 time per week.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually, me and pretty much every one in my guild hates what flying does to the game. It's great in select zones and should be available for those a la FFXIV style (like in Storm Peaks or other zones designed for it), but doesn't make sense everywhere.<br />
<br />
1. It breaks WPvP. There is no defense for this. (Patiently waits for BS middle school answers.)<br />
2. It breaks immersion. However, this is player choice--like you pointed out in your troll post calling people who don't agree with you religious--and shouldn't be pushed on other people purely for this reason.<br />
3. It ruins world PvE content experiences. Players drop in from no where, kill rares, and fly back out--if you were running up, sucks to be you!<br />
4. It ruins questing experiences. However, if you already did all the questing content I don't think you should be forced to do it again on foot--especially old content--so I'll accede this given the right conditions. IE, that content is already done on one character.<br />
<br />
Please stop marginalizing mass opinions just because they aren't yours.</div></div><hr />

It's money being generated from nothing. I have 2 characters with the level 3 inn and I check my alts garrison maybe twice a week while focusing on my main and I STILL make roughly 10k passively per week. My followers are definitely nothing fancy, maybe 4 or 5 treasure hunters and only a few of them are even 100, and I can easily afford to pay for the token doing absolutely nothing.<br />
A huge investment? Are you serious? You must have only just started playing, because you have no idea what a huge investment is. The leveling experience has never been faster and a level 3 garrison with the needed buildings costs what, a couple thousand gold? You'll have that from leveling to 100. <br />
Professions when they were still relevant were both a bigger investment and much harder work (you had to be smart about what you were doing AND you had competition) for a much slower reward that could very easily be completely ruined by one idiot undercutter and completely destroyed by something like a new content patch making you absolutely useless unless you rethought how to make gold (new patch? new mats and patterns). An amazing example is the old ore shuffle. Buy ore -&gt; Prospect -&gt; Craft rare gems that sold well on AH-&gt; transmute other rare gems that didn't sell well into ones that did -&gt; Craft leftover common quality gems into jewelry -&gt; Sell jewelry that sold well on AH -&gt; Disenchant leftover common and rare jewelry -&gt; Create enchant scrolls that sold well on the AH -&gt; Done.<br />
What you need? Knowledge on how to use the undermine journal and keep a spreadsheet updated with prices to see what you have to do to keep it profitable (all ore prices, all gem prices, all jewelry prices, all enchant prices factored in) a maxed out Jewelcrafter with all relevant patterns. A maxed out transmutation alchemist. A maxed out enchanter with all relevant patterns. Not to mention of course enough characters for those 3 professions. You also needed to know how to diversify your stock and check your auctions on a very regular basis to figure out what to do with undercutters. Add in postage fees between alts (they add up) and more importantly auctionhouse listing fees and percentage cut and your profit takes a lot more work than playing a facebook game for about 10 minutes a day. <br />
Get over it. If you can't, nobody is going to miss you, as you're not contributing anything to the game or its economy (besides perhaps inflation). You're simply sitting in your garrison printing money and you have the nerve to call it &quot;Playing the game for gold&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
Agreed, however, it makes the rep grind go a bit faster (one hopes), since you get rep from killing the mob (maybe? not sure), turning in quest(s) (I assume), and killing rares (or so I heard). But, yeah, the thing that was better about daily quest grinding, imo, is there was some nod to story. It is probably very quick to implement reps that are rep per mob, slightly more difficult with a quest with a turn in, and more difficult if you have a bunch of rotating quest (ala mop), and even more difficult if you do some &quot;major&quot; story advancement, i.e. Shieldwall and the like. <br />
<br />
They seem to have taken the easiest to implement route with the initial WoD reps (probably due to it being added at the last moment!). I don't think Tannan Jungle sounds much more engaging, but it sounds &quot;slightly&quot; better (i.e. 27 days of doing dailies to get to revered in all 3? sigh).</div></div><hr />

The funny part is, he said running dungeons over and over felt weird - and then later said one of the benefits of time walking dungeons is you could chain run them to get the rewards.<br />
<br />
This is why nobody believes them anymore, they're so inconsistent with their game philosophy and vision. <br />
<br />
Or, take the alt issue. They now want you to &quot;own&quot; alts, and make them a separate entity you apply as much effort towards as your main. But then they have things like RAF, heirlooms, and all sorts of tools to avoid doing exactly that. And then sell old content as new, for alts. <br />
<br />
Make up your fucking mind!<br />
<br />
Picking apart what he said is pointless - they have no clear vision or leadership. They're in crisis mode, reacting, instead of being proactive. They can't read their customers, they're overthinking the game and putting aesthetics and &quot;integrity&quot; in front of fun, and putting out nonsensical reasons for doing things, because they're so muddled and confused they can't even get it straight themselves.<br />
<br />
The humorous part to me - and it's because I don't pay for the game anymore - is that for all the hype and buildup for this Q&amp;A, it really didn't accomplish anything, and they created two new dramas - the gold mission nerf and warlocks - to rip apart the community more, and polarize players, and drive people away from the game.<br />
<br />
I honestly think they need to shut up, they do more damage when they talk, than when they don't.</div></div><hr />

I unsubbed the day the polygon interview hit the forums and not because of the flight thing (at least not that exclusively). It was more to do with the overwhelmingly condescending tone Ion showed in his responses and the arrogance the dev team has displayed throughout this whole fiasco of an expansion. Players these days make me sick too, I remember when I started playing WoW in 2004 how the in-game community was friendly and people (myself included) would go out of their way to help newbies. Sometime in the last 5 years or so the in-game interactions I've seen with other players has mimicked the nastiness of the bnet forums -- crude, stupid and belligerent -- lots of people are sh*theels just because they can be. This game was fun while it lasted but it's on an irrecoverable downward spiral and me and my friends &amp; family guild want nothing to do with it anymore. We've gone over to FFXIV and we are having actual fun again without the devs telling us how we should play or that our idea of fun is wrong, and on top of that the other players you run into are actually nice and helpful!</div></div><hr />

I agree with much of your post, and we will never get an admission from anyone that the team is all over the place with their direction unless the game goes Free to Play or some devs come out and speak some real truth (perhaps even after leaving blizzard).<br />
<br />
The visible WoW community is probably the most legendarily toxic in history however, we damn them if they do and damn them if they don't, especially in regards to communication.<br />
<br />
What's awful however, is Blizzard mentioning things like &quot;Worst spec,&quot; and acknowledging &quot;You must have 1 of X,&quot; After so many years they threw everything into the homogenization and simplification blender! Wow has gone down the path of casualization has it not?? :(</div></div><hr />

* After the initial interview, the player and team feedback made them reconsider flying. Never is a powerful word, so once it was out there, players who were fine with being on the ground started to think about the flying mounts they would never get to use again. It felt like something very valuable was being taken away from players.<br />
* The team is happy with the compromise that they came up with and how it is has been received.<br />
* The delay on communication about flying after the decision in the initial interview was because the discussion was ongoing and a decision hadn't been reached. Even saying that they were still debating the issue could have gotten hopes up and then disappointed many players if they decided to not allow flying.<br />
<br />
<br />
In other words &quot;We saw a LOT of flying-related subscription cancellations after we finally said &quot;never again&quot; to flying, so we're scurrying like rats on a sinking ship to plug the hole.&quot;<br />
<br />
Well, Blizz. Too little, too late. If you want this game to be successful again, you go back and you study WotLK and what made that expansion so successful. Then you take those lessons and you implement them into current WoW. To some this may feel like regression, but that's not a bad thing when a previous state was superior to the current state. &quot;Progress is only good when it makes things better.&quot; You've been on a downward slide in both Subs and game design since ICC.</div></div><hr />

Ion is very good at making it sound like what he's saying is reasonable and rational, but when you start pulling it apart, you get gems like that. He's a trained lawyer, after all. He's good at blowing smoke up your skirt. <br />
<br />
You can have a lot of fun with it, too. So, Ion, you want flying removed, so people see and do the quests as designed...but you made it easier to get heirlooms, which reduce the amount of questing you have to do to level, so a lot of players will never see those quests.<br />

Snipped out other things. Almost seems like the group is too large with no leadership or too many chiefs and not enough indians. Too many groups that come up with something in a vacuum and just add it without someone over seeing it.</div></div><hr />

Just Mythic guilds, for obvious recruitment and roster reasons. It has never been a better time to raid casually in a &quot;Heroic&quot; guild. Flexible size is insanely good.</div></div><hr />
