As some of you have already noticed, the Paid Character Transfer service has been temporarily shut down so that further efforts may be made to ensure that its correct functionality is restored; our developers are currently working to repair the underlying coding issues that have contributed to the present complications for many players. While it is not known at this time when further updates shall become available, you may rest assured that we shall make you aware with all due haste at that time; for now, we are greatly appreciative of your continued patience. Thanks, folks. &amp;#58;) <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shadowclaimer</div><div class="date">2007-07-08, 07:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Maybe the code refining will remove the issue that forces the 3 month waiting time.. as Blizzard reps had told my friend many times, it has nothing to do with gold farmers etc. but it is actually an error in the coding and the way it sends data that prevents you from moving once every 3 months o.O<br />
<br />
Speculation: Maybe your character itself doesn't move but the location at which you read data does? and slowly over the course of 3 months your data gets slowly transferred?</div></div><hr />

I migrated a char friday last week, and everything went perfect.. So i guess the issues are US only.. *shrugs*</div></div><hr />

On US servers, everything went very well, did take long at all either. About 30 mins in total. I've had 3 transfers in the last 15 days, all of them done with ease.</div></div><hr />
