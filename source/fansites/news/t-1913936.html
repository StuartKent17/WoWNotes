Legion - Fury Warrior and Shadow Priest Artifact Intros <br />
Another two Artifact intros today: Fury Warrior (http://beta.wowdb.com/items/128908-odyns-fury) and Shadow Priest (http://beta.wowdb.com/items/128827-xalatath-blade-of-the-black-empire). Be sure to look for some of the new melee animations in the Warrior video!<br />

Not seeing runeforging in #LegionAlpha, can you confirm that they've been taken out? Really liked having diff enchants. <br />
Runeforging is remaining, it's just learned through a quest which the template characters don't have completed. We'll fix that. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/672495333209849856))<br />

Mistweaver mastery currently only procs off of Effuse \ Vivify. Intended? Only has 1 proc from 3 hits of Vivify. Intended?<br />
Should proc from Renewing Mist and Enveloping Mist as well. Only procs from the primary target of Vivify. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/672494650637205504))<br />

Yep! The alternate demon pets will be available via Minor Glyphs. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/672494961191813121))<br />

PvP level brackets are not changing. The gear provided will scale to your level (similar to Timewalking gear). (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/672521095312834560))<br />

Any change to Ashran loser buff Tues? 7+ groups so far who refuse to ever kill boss for fear of a &quot;debuff&quot;<br />

state fel magic isn't arcane. Arcane can be demonic but perhaps not all demonic magic is arcane?<br />

<br />
Misc<br />
I don't think maths are 'really' essential, but they are of course handy.<br />
I'd say that at least Algebra *is* essential for most forms of game design. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/672129362204884992))<br />
If for nothing else than that you can develop a better gut for numbers used. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/672129619261165568))<br />
Sure, you can start with wildly wrong numbers, and iterate, but is slower. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/672129788283236352))<br />
Could you provide a real example, please?<br />
It can be complex stuff, like figuring out the paths of Cinderstorm, or... (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/672130090919059457))<br />
...it can be simple stuff, like estimating how long people will take to... (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/672130187220246528))<br />
...complete your quest POI, to know how many quests you need to make. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/672130303943577600))<br />
(Or what drop rate to make the quest item, to average the intended kill count) (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/672130462622474240))<br />
Even the less-mathy sorts of designers still use some math. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/672130593954508800))<br />
<br />
Do you think that percentages &amp; statistics are the most common types of math? I mean, the most common type of math involved in game design in general.<br />
Beyond basic math? Across all types of game design, probably, yes. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/672131741843193856))<br />

Ghostcrawler Tweets<br />
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br />
Players may feel it's arrogance to claim design is a collaboration then outright dismiss their idea w/o dialogue.<br />
I agree, but it's challenging to have a dialogue with everyone when you are blessed with many players. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/671419326575026177))<br />
<br />
Sometimes I feel this is based on it being rare. If admitting mistake was normal, maybe it'd be different?<br />
If you are constantly admitting mistakes, it is possible over time you develop a reputation as sloppy and careless, I suppose. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/671694618958815232))<br />
<br />
In other industries, huge mistakes can get one fired. Game devs seem to feel entitled to make mistakes freely.<br />
Iteration is at the heart of design, and that means making a lot of mistakes...and then fixing them! (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/670747190264901632))<br />
<br />
question for you...blizz devs are basically silent nowadays. Was Communication a major reason for the job change for you?<br />
I'll say that Riot's comm philosophy is more simpatico with my own. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/670796357741883393))<br />

<br />
Actually in the design space of any industry, failure is VERY common. I just think that in the gaming world, the space between the end user and the designer is much closer than say someone designing a new motor for a piece of industrial equipment.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You mean like the near non-existent communication from developers at Blizz?<br />
<br />
Personally, I find many of his comments are directly relevant to the genre and/or game development in general. He has also, often but not always, actually implicitly defended Blizzard by challenging the assumptions and over simplifications of those posing the questions and suggesting that's game development isn't nearly as simply or straightforward as they seem to imply.<br />
<br />
And from MMO-Champ's perspective they often wouldn't have much to post on a given day if it wasn't for GC responding to questions about the genre because lords knows developer communication at Blizzard is severely lacking.<br />
<br />
You're not forced to read them anymore than you are forced to check out the DLC comics etc that are posted...you know you can just skip over his comments, right?.<br />
<br />
But as GC himself has often said you can't keep everyone happy so for everyone like yourself that doesn't want to read his comments there are folks like me that appreciate his insights...and that's coming from a guy that wasn't a fan of many of his design decisions but can at least appreciate and respect his insights based on his lengthy resume and extensive experience.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Yeah, but to me that wouldn't make a huge difference wether they post nothing or something from GC. If they post nothing I see right away that there is nothing tho...instead of scanning through GC's comments cause there might be something(but never is either).</div></div><hr />
