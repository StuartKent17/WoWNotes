Free T-Shirt Day Micro-Holiday<br />
The Free T-Shirt Day (https://ptr.wowdb.com/world-events/1053-free-t-shirt-day) Micro-Holiday is now active for the day!<br />
<br />
<br />
An NPC marked on your map with a rare mob icon wanders around either The Valley of Honor (Orgrimmar) or the Dwarven District (Stormwind).<br />
The NPC carries a t-shirt gun and periodically launches one. A t-shirt appears on the ground that becomes clickable (https://ptr.wowdb.com/objects/310737-free-t-shirt).<br />
Clicking the shirt gives you either:<br />
<br />
A blue item called &quot;Free T-Shirt&quot; that visually removes the upper portions of your armor to expose the shirt you are wearing underneath. You can only use this item if you are wearing a shirt in the slot.<br />
A variety of cosmetic shirts<br />
<br />
You can also find NPCs around the world who will sell you t-shirts for free!<br />

Oh bullshit. It's cosmetic armor. It's probably not exactly high on their priority list, nor is it a make or break feature. I'd rather have them communicate as long as what they say is true at the time and they're at least fairly certain they'll stay on schedule. But shit happens. Not every changed plan is malicious. Not every delay is done because they hate the playerbase and are twirling their mustache while laughing maniacally about lying to us. We weren't &quot;lied to&quot;. Plans changed, shit happened.

You are the person the &quot;I was promised a pony&quot; meme was invented to mock.

Goblin and Worgen fans will be pleased to hear that the long-awaited model update for each will be arriving in a future content patch.<br />

“Shortly after Rise of Azshara, you’ll see that,” Morgan explained. “These are the two races that haven’t been updated. They’ll have new heritage armor with that as well.”<br />

<br />
Lol, calling me a white knight is hilarious in itself. A lot of my posts are shitting on the shitstorm that is BfA. If im going to complain about something though, it's not going to be what was probably an innocent delay, it'll be actual core systems of the game or times when blizzard is actually lying or misleading (WoD's entire patch cycle for instance). Ever read the boy who cried wolf? Same concept applies here. Cry about everything and it cheapens the real complaints. So yes, continue to be a whiny, entitled little shit by all means. <br />
<br />
Again, plans change, if you can't deal with that, maybe you shouldnt try to gain information about future patches before their release because you're bound to get disappointed at some point. Especially if you latch onto a tiny issue like heritage armor.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No it wouldn't. People aren't angry because they don't announce stuff - and if they are it's a vast minority of idiots - what does piss people off and rightly so is when you say something would happen and then it doesn't.<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
If we deal with Sylvanas in 8.3 - I can kinda see how it would make more sense to tie the worgen heritage into that seeing as how important to the Worgen story she is, but if that's why they aren't coming with the model update they shouldn't have even talked about it. That said, at least we do have the update which is far more important</div></div><hr />

At the time of the interview it was already known for half a year that the model updates for Goblins and Worgen would come with 8.2.5, so the implication was obviously that the heritage armor would also be introduced in 8.2.5, going by that interview.</div></div><hr />

Except there was no &quot;thinking&quot; or &quot;planned&quot;, it was definitive. This is the exact quote:<br />
<br />
<br />
Goblin and Worgen fans will be pleased to hear that the long-awaited model update for each will be arriving in a future content patch.<br />
<br />
“Shortly after Rise of Azshara, you’ll see that,” Morgan explained. “These are the two races that haven’t been updated. They’ll have new heritage armor with that as well.”<br />
<br />
Sure, &quot;with&quot; could mean at the same time (the implied meaning) or in succession of and &quot;that&quot; doesn't have to mean the models' release itself but to the update in general. So, they could be delivering this in 8.3, and could even include a bigger event with the Gilneas hints we've seen. But to say it was communicated as anything but definitive is just blind, uninformed fanboyism at work. If you actually cared to be objective, you'd check before stating otherwise.<br />
<br />
I personally am fine with it being delayed (though upset if it was then shelved permanently). I'd rather have the new models get more attention with revisions and the patch be delivered faster. Unfortunately there's people that cling to anything negative from Blizzard as an excuse to either just blindly hate or defend.</div></div><hr />

so i expect the Heritage armour to be out 8.3 at the earliest. and 9.0 at the lastest. <br />

Finally someone with common sense. Although i also belive they are pushing a lot of things because of Classic. This will explain why the PTR are just a bunch of Encrypted files and just a little things, like bones, nname npcs, flags and nothing innusual apart from some weird strings about Orgrimmar and Gilneas.<br />
SO i will be actually more focused on what they are going to release on 8.3 or Blizzcon, at this point we cant even test the 15 aniversary boss gauntlets yet... and thats one of the main focused of the patch. <br />

<br />
It's two armor sets. In an expansion that deliberately removed Tier sets so that the art team could make more frequent, more varied, higher quality armor. <br />
<br />
Now I dunno about you, but as a Leather-wearing main, I have been positively fucking STARVED for transmogs this expansion. There's hardly any armor sets being added and - if you're not one of the handful of races that has already received a new Heritage set - the sets that ARE being added are almost universally garbage. <br />
The only appearances that look up-to-stuff are the Mythic raid sets and the Rated PvP sets, and even those only look &quot;as good&quot; as the Heroic-level stuff from the last two expansions. <br />
<br />
Like... did Blizzard just fire 80% of the art team without anyone hearing about it? This last patch has added a whopping eight or nine armor sets to the game and they're all fucking Cataclysm quality. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Got a bit sidetracked there. My point is that they've had at least a goddamn year to create a measly two armor sets and they couldn't even manage that. There are lone unemployed art nerds living off of noodles who put this multi-billion-dollar company's ENTIRE collective armor asset team to shame in quality, quantity AND speed combined. <br />
If we can't even hold billion-dollar Activision-Blizzard to the same standards as a single college student's fucking Dropbox or Sketchfab account, what standard ARE we holding them to?<br />
<br />

<br />
&quot;Shortly after the Rise of Azshara... in a future content patch&quot; They did NOT say 8.2.5. YOU assumed that is when it would be, were wrong, and are trying to pin the blame on Blizzard for &quot;lying&quot; to you.Let me walk you through this. <br />
<br />
“Shortly after Rise of Azshara, you’ll see that,” Morgan explained. “These are the two races that haven’t been updated. They’ll have new heritage armor with that as well.” <br />
<br />
That means that the Worgen and Goblin model updates and heritage armor sets are both coming &quot;shortly after the rise of Azshara&quot;, and that they're both coming out at the same time. <br />
&quot;They'll have new heritage armor with that as well.&quot; <br />
<br />
We later find out that the model updates are coming in 8.2.5. <br />
With no update on the armor sets, people are (obviously) led to believe that the plan hasn't changed - that the heritage armor set is still coming out with the model update. <br />
<br />
And then, much later, we get a single half-assed sentenced &quot;Oh the armor sets aren't coming with the model updates.&quot;<br />
Only after being asked about it, time and time again. <br />
<br />
If they hadn't been asked, they never would've told us that Morgan's original statement had since changed. And it HAS changed. <br />
<br />
Original statement: &quot;Model updates are coming out and heritage armor is coming out with them.&quot; <br />
Current statement: &quot;Model updates are coming out and heritage armor is coming out later.&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Do you understand?<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit:<br />
On reflection, I'm honestly not even upset about the Heritage armor sets, or that they've clearly been pushed back. <br />
I'm just pissed off at how bad the armor situation has been in BFA in general. Low-effort armor sets that I literally haven't seen a single person in the entire game wearing, no Tiers, being promised by Blizzard &quot;The removal of Tiers means we can make even more frequent and varied armor sets from other sources!&quot; which turned out to be a blatant fucking lie. <br />
They went from a Tier set per class to a Tier set per armor-type and didn't add anything new or varied anywhere else. Oh, aside from a bunch of Cataclysm recolours from Islands and some heritage armor sets for the least-played races in the game (and Blood Elves)! Wow! <br />
<br />
WoD having an entire tier of armor sets being removed is literally a meme, and that expansion STILL had more, and better, armor sets in it than BFA does. <br />
That's... that's just fucking sad.</div></div><hr />

Wow, such a stretch. Do you not know what &quot;They’ll have new heritage armor with that as well.&quot; means? That = model updates. With that = implies releasing at the same time. Models are releasing in 8.2.5. This is simple english.<br />

Listen. They literally said the heritage armor would come with the model updates - and I'm not even mad, I don't care about the heritage that much - I don't use any of them because they're welfare sets - I'm saying that people are perfectly justified to be mad because Blizzard are going back on something they actually said - not something we thought they said.</div></div><hr />

YOU assumed that is when it would be, were wrong, and are trying to pin the blame on Blizzard for &quot;lying&quot; to you.<br />
<br />
So, they said &quot;with&quot; the new models in an interview, which cannot be taken any other way. But, clearly, that's not the case, so let's set that aside for just a moment.<br />
<br />
The site that had that original interview stated that Heritage Armor was coming with Worgen/Goblin updated models. Soon Wowhead and MMO-C stated that, as well as notable WoW-related Youtube channels and other fansites. It was on reddit, twitter, and other sites/apps.<br />
<br />
Blizzard saw that the Heritage Armor was being stated by everyone for 8.2.5 (sourced from one of their own in an interview) for months, and only now decided to correct that with the 8.2.5 PTR, after people asked about it not being in the files. They had a lot of time to correct everyone, or simply say at some time &quot;We are aiming for 8.2.5&quot; or &quot;We were planning for 8.2.5 but it has to be pushed back.&quot; Whether or not they &quot;lied&quot; is irrelevant to me - they didn't correct any facts given out (by one of their own), knowing that the community is starving for anything that would make BfA fun again.<br />
<br />
While I don't mind it being pushed back if they plan to take more time to make it (one could hope), it's clear they mishandled this topic on top of numerous others when it comes to BfA.</div></div><hr />
