Sunday, no news, you can leave this site. No, actually, I updated a few things. 
The Hall of Fame was updated with better screenshots, basically it just means that I removed most of the old annoying watermarks on the older kills. 
I realized that some pages (like the Consumables list) still had old items, I updated most of them a few weeks ago but some still had old version stats. Everything should be updated now.

Tempest Keep / Serpentshrine Cavern movie<br />
Considering how popular Curse's Black Temple video was, it's time for another video to keep you busy on sunday. Numen (http://www.numen-guild.com/) released a very nicely edited movie of Serpentshrine Cavern and Tempest Keep. You can get tons of details about the movie in this post (http://forums.wow-europe.com/thread.html?topicId=612473755&amp;sid=1) and you can watch it below if you've got the DiVX plugin from stage6. (If you don't, download it, or try this link (http://stage6.divx.com/user/Qvist/video/1586459/Vials-of-Eternity) but you'll need it anyway)</div></div><hr />

To help build expectation I will inform you that it is very visually stimulating!</div></div><hr />

<br />
And the video editing is excellent, very impressing!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">greatapoc</div><div class="date">2007-09-03, 01:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I like how they spent that much time on the editing and completely neglected to fix any spelling mistakes like &quot;Astromacer&quot; or &quot;Karatresh&quot;. Makes it seem really cheap.</div></div><hr />

Although I still like the video that was hosted by Curse better because it showed the entire fights and how they played out. These are basically 30 second clips followed by a kill shot.</div></div><hr />
