There's more lore behind Ashbinger than any other item in-game. It will be interesting to see how this pans out; I've been thinking that it may end up being the one thing that can defeat the Lich King.<br />

He was, but an old quest chain in EPL has the player take disguise as a member of the Scarlett Crusade to help bring around his son, Highlord Taelen Fordring, to how corrupted the Scarlet Crusade had become. The event culminates in Taelen's death at the hands of Inquisitor Isilliean (sp?) after a brief confrontation. Tirion avenges his son's death by slaying the inquisitor and swears an oath to resurrect the Silver Hand.</div></div><hr />

They stripped him of his rank and position and claimed they stripped him of his power. While they were able to do the first and second, but it is beyond them to strip him of his power, for it was not a power given to him by the leaders of the Order of the Silver Hand, but from something far greater. They merely taught him how to tap into that power. Afterwards, he was shown to still have the ability to tap into the Holy Light, since he maintained the true meaning of being a Paladin by staying true to his word in the face of opposition. His strength of character is well worthy of one who should lead the reborn Order.</div></div><hr />

That quote (which you paraphrased) is said by Eligor Dawnbringer to Scarlet Commander Marjhan. The Fordring being referred to is his Taelan Fordring (the Scarlet Highlord), as Marjhan reports to him and not Tirion (who is not part of the Scarlet Crusade). Dawnbringer is threatening to reveal the alliance that Marjhan made with AD and BoL behind Taelan's back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now be silent and note where you are, lest I inform Lord Fordring and his knights that you are no longer here on amicable terms. I am certain he would take great pleasure in seeing to your 'atonement.'&quot; -Eligor Dawnbringer</div></div><hr />

So there should be legendaries for every spec for every class? and when Hand of Ragnaros was obtainable, Molten Core was end-game and all legendaries have been like that, casters were just unlucky for Naxx to be the final 40 man raid before TBC.</div></div><hr />

To all those hunters out there, for me they could just do an epic version of the cleansed Ashbringer, it doesn't even have to be state of the art, give it 130 dps so you can use it for levelling (check Jin'rokh of Zul'Aman with 128 DPS + 100 AP)<br />
I just want that they finish the storyline...<br />

<br />
According to a guy that claims to have talked to Chris Metzen and Alex (the Quest chief his last name i forget) at Blizzcon, Alliance players will have a quest chain at Valgarde to reforge the sword and give it to Tirion, but it will be an NPC-weilded weapon, not attainable by players. The guy sounds legit, and the story is partially confirmed by the screenies we have... <br />

Why would blizzard make it available to you then? Doesn't make any sense...<br />
IMO, if players can weild it, it won't be after a long quest including some lvl80 end game content (raiding etc.) to be worthy of the sword. <br />
Since Tirion Fordring is holding it, you'll probably have to prove him you are the &quot;champion&quot; of the Order of the Silver Hand, then he could pass it on to you, or something along those lines.<br />
If that is the case there's however an issue: Why would the horde (enemies of the Order of the Silver Hand) be allowed to wield it? I mean a UD warrior??? Hell no! BUT here's the solution: Allies get Ashbringer and Horde get Frostmourne ^.^<br />
I think the two are about as powerfull, and it would be a nice touch to the game to have different weapons for the two factions. Genius? Dumb? I'll take both :-)<br />
<br />
As for CoT, I agree with the posts that says it'll be the events related in &quot;Day of the Dragon&quot;, which would make me skip around screaming and kicking with joy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
True, but the forsaken are still undead... And frostmourn if it is weilded by players will not have the power of the Lich king, just the power of the blade itself, therefor it is possible that they are evenly matched. I'm not saying that's what they'll do, but I think it'd be cool if they didn something like that. Technically a pally shouldn't wield Frostmourn, since it's the symbol of the downfall of the order, so bloodknights could, and pallies could get Ashbringer.<br />
It WOULD be cool, ok, you know it would! one would have some frost dmg (frostmourn) the other fire dmg.<br />
Besides, there's nothing that suggests that Frostmourn itself (without the Lich King behind it) would be anymore powerfull than Ashbringer, I mean the Ashbringer (the wielder) killed a 1000 undead before he was murdered, that shows some pretty sick power. I don't recall hearing about Arthas killing 1000 soldiers standing alone or almost.</div></div><hr />

all of those are, based on the slots they match, ranged weapons... ;-)</div></div><hr />

Just look at the stats ur normal gear has, and look at what your wand/relic/whateverelse has, doesn't fit to make it legendary.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xebtria</div><div class="date">2007-08-07, 12:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">well... there are two legendarys who deservers the tag &quot;legendary&quot;.<br />
- thunderfury (the proc, nerfed to hell and now replaceable with imp. thunderclap)<br />
- Atiesh (aura for grpmembers, port to karazhan)<br />
<br />
sulfuras was infact more an style-item then an good weapon. replaceable kinda quick with asscandy... in a time, where the common meaning of ms-warriors, enhancement-shamans, feral-druids and retri-paladins was... well... not the best.<br />
<br />
warglaives of azzinoth... 10 dps more than other epics in BT/MH... one, infact, uber proc with increadible 400 haste... but... then it's the end of story...<br />
wow.<br />
<br />
what i'am imagine of is... well. let's say an relic for shamans. adds nothing than an extra totem called &quot;totem of binding winds&quot; or such.<br />
every melee attack, spell or heal has an low chance to bind the enemy in a cyclone (or such...), making him unable to move and attack for 5 secs.<br />
1) LOW chance to proc, not to make it extremely imbalanced. but high enough, so you can see it proccing more than once a month.^^<br />
2) Works on EVERYTHING. normal mobs, raid-trahs, bosses, PvP, totems (remember e.g. spitfire totem on karathress)<br />
3) for the part of proccing while healing... well. the target-of-target, or even target's-target-of-target - method would help a much. first hostile target in this row is afflicted then.<br />
4) OF COURSE an also extremely fcking low dropchance, but in an mid-common-instance. so many people has the chance to get it, but even less people get it in the end.<br />
5) maybe an bossdrop (or more, like thunderfury), that is for paladins, shamans, druids, and depending on which class starts the questchain (which, of course, is easy to reach the places where it has to be done, but hard to master it), the final reward would be an libram, relic or idol... <br />
<br />
THIS would be deserved to reflect the meaning of &quot;legendary&quot;.<br />
<br />
no &quot;just-10-dps-more-plus-extra-proc&quot;-thing. this is boooooooring like hell.<br />
<br />
need more UNIQUE things. not boring things with just a cool skin (hi@warglaives....)<br />
<br />

every melee attack, spell or heal has an low chance to bind the enemy in a cyclone (or such...), making him unable to move and attack for 5 secs.<br />
2) Works on EVERYTHING. normal mobs, raid-trahs, bosses, PvP, totems (remember e.g. spitfire totem on karathress)<br />

do you REALLY think in getting an uber item like you describe?<br />

there will be NOTHING unique, that &quot;may&quot; gives your advantages in boss fights<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
Ashbringer:<br />
Commander Eligor Dawnbringer: Yet you think that recovering Ashbringer will somehow turn the tide of battle? Let me let you in on a little secret, Commander. The power of the Ashbringer came from the man who would wield it... I was there, Commander. I watched him burn legions of undead in righteous fire before he would even unsheathe the blade. Alas, your grasp on history is... lacking.<br />
<br />
Frostmourne:<br />
The Lich King uses this ability to try and corrupt the wielder over time. This has several effects. An individual who wields Frostmourne will not part with it willingly. Over time the person will go from good to neutral and finally to evil. A non-undead evil wielder will then become undead. Finally the sword is able to suck the being's soul into the sword. Frostmourne then retains the memories and skills of its victim. In fact as long as the wielder's original body remains within one mile of Frostmourne, the sword maintains control of the body, and he may not be completely aware that his consciousness has shifted to the weapon. Beyond one mile, the sword cannot control the wielder's body, and the wielder of course finally becomes quite aware of his current state (if he is not already). <br />

Did the ashbringer give the wielder (Highlord Mograine) his abilities or were they his own?<br />
Frostmourne has the ability to make each weilder stronger than the previous.</div></div><hr />

Where as the Runeswords stole the souls of their weilders and bound them to their will, the Ashbringer was a symbiotic extension of the will of its weilder, its power amplified by Highlord Mograine due to the fact that he willfully gave part of his own soul to contribute to its creation.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There's more lore behind Ashbinger than any other item in-game. It will be interesting to see how this pans out; I've been thinking that it may end up being the one thing that can defeat the Lich King.<br />

it would be unfair if u need Ashbringer to kill him but it may have something to do with like: u can kill him from his &quot;living&quot; form but maybe it will have a phas that u need Ashbringer to kill his spritital form? and maybe its thats way they are moving Naxx to Northrend...</div></div><hr />

thunderfury anyone? this was unique like hell on the beginning. 20% less attackspeed? also functionable at bosses? like &quot;woot&quot; it is so much unique, that even NOW tanks who has it are still unsing it. no one likes to skill imp TC to play the debuffbot... so they're using tf... and hell yes, there are many peoples with thunderfury, but it's because mc has been farmed for about 2 years, nearly every guild on a server has farmed it for years only for tf. but: there are not so much tfs, that it is like you would say &quot;oh look, my huntertwink has tf. yay... /yawn&quot; think about, what happens if every guild on every server is, e.g., farming illidan for 2 years. comparing the actual droprate (well... in i'd say 30 kills right now there are... 5? 6? drops....) to that... the warglaives would be default equippement for EVERY rogue + warrior on the servers... and this is everything... but NOT legendary anymore...<br />
<br />
anyway... it was just a goddamn EXAMPLE. to show, only 10 dps, a in spite of everything nice setbonus and a apparently not really much lower droprate (+ kewl skin, yay) is NOT worth the quality &quot;legendary&quot;. shard of azzinoth is better in an simular rate than the other daggers. quality? exactly. epic.<br />
<br />
the relic I described, is overpowered, yes. i knew that sth like that would never ever make the way into the game. it was just an example that real legendarys need to have something unique (like TF-debuff was 2 years ago) and a really goddamn low droprate... <br />
<br />
so long,<br />

We're not here to think like noobs, though, are we? In a rational raid group, a hunter would never roll against a warrior/rogue/etc. on TF or other melee weapon with melee proc and should never end up with such unless all those who truly benefit from it have it already, then take it for stats and the rare times forced into melee.<br />
Likewise, I would hope that those who use ranged weapons in rare cases (or just to pull) would have the sense to leave rolling on a ranged legendary to the hunters, and I know everyone I currently raid with would play that way. And if I saw a warrior or rogue rolling with it, I would hope like hell there were no hunters there that day or that they already had it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Did the ashbringer give the wielder (Highlord Mograine) his abilities or were they his own?<br />
Frostmourne has the ability to make each weilder stronger than the previous. <br />
<br />
<br />
I think Kondara makes a good point in his/her post. I, like others, am a believer that Frostmourne and Ashbringer are opposites of one another. Frostmourne is meant to overcome the soul of its wielder, absorb it, and turn the wielder into a tool and focal point for the sword's own will. The Ashbringer is the epitome of holy weapons. When in the hands of a powerful holy warrior (such as Highlord Mograine) it is able to focus and strengthen their power to the point where they can lay waste to entire legions of unholy minions by themselves.<br />
<br />
So, the question doesn't seem as much &quot;whether&quot; Blizz will put the Ashbringer into play for WotLK, but rather &quot;how&quot; they will do it. Personally, for someone like myself who loves thinking about how lore such as this could play out, I'd rather neither weapon be available to players; just seems like it would ruin it in some fundamental way. And, as we've seen already in this thread, there are more than enough infantile, selfish opinions on who is &quot;worthy&quot; of such weapons already without them even being in-game yet. <br />
<br />
Personally, when players finally do get a chance to fight Arthas, I would like to see a fight played out similarly to that of Illidan where the raid is joined by some of the heroes from Warcraft. In the final fight against Arthas, I don't think it would be unlikely to have Jaina, Tirion Fordring (with Ashbringer in tow), and Sylvanas step in to help bring him down. They each would have their reason, and I think it would just make for one hell of a fight!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I totally agree. And that would surely make a stronger lore, a more credible one, as fighting Arthas with 24 other people is, actually, not ridiculous but.. we're not so powered ;) So having these guys fighting at our side would be... legendary :) Maybe the Ashbringer would have that little debuff that changes the combat completely, and makes it possible for us to really damage the Lich King. But that's just speculation from a lore-lover :)</div></div><hr />
