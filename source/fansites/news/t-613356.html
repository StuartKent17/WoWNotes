Ongoing Wintergrasp Changes<br />
Here's a quick update on some of the things coming to Wintergrasp over the course of the next few beta updates.<br />
<br />
Graveyards will be inaccessible to attackers (ie: above normal terrain) to put a damper on gy camping.<br />
Ranking up will be based on HKs rather than killing blows (was always intended to be HKs)<br />
In the case of team imbalances, there will be escalating bonuses to the weaker team (for both honor and combat effectiveness... mostly survivability bonuses and potentially easier access to vehicles)<br />
The losing team will receive a partial bonus at the end of a battle (also based on participation)<br />
Players will be able to leave Wintergrasp at any time (via a &quot;Leave Battle&quot; UI option similar to leaving a battleground)<br />
A variety of daily quests will be introduced to the zone, including quests that are relevant when the battle isn't currently active<br />
Ongoing tuning of vehicle power (they're still on the strong side)<br />
Ongoing bugfixing and polish<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Something else we're hoping to get in, but aren't certain of at this point is the ability to select which graveyard you respawn at. <br />
<br />
<br />
Blue posts<br />
World Server is down<br />
This is not uncommon in beta. &quot;World Server Down&quot; means that something is specifically crashing Northrend. On our end, when this happens we track down what is causing the crash and fix it. Some things are easier to find than others. Some things are easier to fix than others. While feedback from Beta testers is absolutely crucial to us, just having people on the server &quot;doing stuff&quot; also reveals a lot to us. I know how annoying it can be to be kicked from the server but you really are helping us get things stable. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/9336869724-world-server-is-down.html))<br />
<br />
Riding Crop<br />
The jury is still out on what's going to happen to the crop. We hope to have a solution soon. The main goal was to get the riding crop out of the trinket slot. It's very common to end up in combat with a riding crop equipped which wasn't very fun. It was also tedious to have to swap trinkets everytime you mounted (even with a mod like Outfitter or with macros).<br />
<br />
We ran into some technical issues when we switched over to our new mount system. So the crop is somewhat in flux. The main design goal is &quot;not a trinket&quot;. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/9336669931-the-riding-crop.html))<br />
<br />
Strand of the Ancients and Wintergrasp Achievements soon<br />
Good suggestion. We're going to be adding Wintergrasp and Strand of the Ancients achievements soon so any brainstorming by you guys is welcome. Now is the time -- let's hear those ideas! (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/20/9336518217-new-achievement-red-baron.html))<br />

Zhevra Mount achievement not worth points anymore<br />
This one has been changed to be a Feat of Strength. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/20/9336578380-zhevra-mount-should-not-be-worth-points.html))<br />

Obliterate / Scourge Strike<br />
I think Obliterate just needs to do more damage and Scourge Strike less. They are very similar abilities so it's easy to imagine numbers balanced in such a way that Obliterate is fun for Blood (when you don't need Death Strike) and Scourge Strike is an improvement to Obliterate for Unholy without being the only talent you ever need in that tree.

Poison Skills Feats of Strength ?<br />
Gamnin mentioned &quot;Weâ€™re removing the Poisons skill and making the finished poisons available on vendors for purchase. This should free up a fair amount of bag space. &quot; We should get a Feats of Strength for having the skill at max before its removal.<br />
This is a cool idea. We'll look into it although depending on how the class team handled the removal of poisons, we may or may not be able to do this as a Feat. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/20/9336668591-suggestion-feat-of-strength-for-poisons.html))</div></div><hr />

And this one has parry rating and strength. Wasted stats for a tankign druid.<br />
Right now, except for a necklace and maybe a trinket I will still wear my tank stuff from level 70.<br />
<br />
Seems like you will be able to tell the other stats of an item by knowing its stamina because the stat distribution seems to be always the same roughly. &quot;Oh, 59 stamina and leather melee? Will have 24 hit rating and 43 agility&quot;. :-[</div></div><hr />

EH stands for? But I guess you mean armor. Well, thing is that items of item level 200 (blue pvp gear and faction rewards still have 30-40% less armor than druid t6. Sunwell items make the gap even wider. That means I am just shifting stats from level 70 to 80. Armor be gone, welcome dodge (which is nerfed as far as I know anyway). <br />
<br />
Doesn't sound very well designed to me.</div></div><hr />

Oh, for that. Thanks anyway.<br />
<br />
<br />

I know that I won't get my true upgrades before 25-man Naxx. And since I took blues for comparison the armor values will differ less in the end.<br />
<br />
Still, I did this to express my worries. When 3.0 hits we will get quite a stat boost since we can replace def/res stuff. I do not know what our agi/dodge ratio will be but as far as I know it will be nerfed. So with 3.0 we will also lose something.<br />
Thing is, the redesigning you are talking about just happened. Reading the blue posts before the last patch tells my something like &quot;we will assure, we will see, we want to... etc&quot; but after mother bear I read &quot;less armor won't be an issue&quot;. Looks like this was their idea of redesign for now.<br />
<br />
Of course I could be wrong and we must consider that they are just designing the very first raid encounters and so there isn't any proper way for the class designers to compare the tanks yet but Blizz is running out of time... and we all know that Blizzard likes fixing things on the fly (remember the mage spelldmg multiplier?).<br />
<br />
Another thought is tier gear. Right now all items look like there is no tier gear anymore (usable by dozens of specs etc) but of course there will be. Maybe we will see our armor then again, maybe they finally implement a forth tierset for druids. Right know it's hardly to tell if the blues are talking about 5man content and endgame raiding (endgame starts at the third 25man for me).</div></div><hr />

there's a few pieces, but more than likely they were added at the last moment, or even in later patches.<br />
<br />
i know its said more than often around here, but seeing as they make blue posts showing that they are aware of these issues, they likely have some idea of whats going on.<br />
<br />
Im sure they arent gonna put all this work into feral and leave them gimp gear that will end their pve tanking viability.</div></div><hr />

<br />
the thing is, with all the feral talent changes, it's not gimp gear.<br />
<br />
Ferals should be able to get about the same EH avoidance and TPS as warrior and paladin tanks in that kind of gear (DKs are a work in process)</div></div><hr />

Not everyone likes to level a new character just so they can get the right gear. Also not everyone likes Rogues, especially being part of the stereotype of people play Rogues.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Seriously. With Skillet, I just say &quot;I want to make 20 wound poisons&quot;, then I go talk to a shady dealer and hit the &quot;buy reagents for queued recipes&quot; button that Skillet provides. It's pretty much identical to actually buying the poisons, just that it takes a few minutes to make them. I generally vendor the poison reagents I find in lockboxes. I know it's a waste of gold, but it's just not worth keeping them in my bags.<br />
<br />
Maybe they noticed that lots of rogues vendor their poison reagents and just buy them when they're crafting them, and wanted to streamline it a bit.<br />
<br />
In a related note, I'm a little concerned with the druid tank itemization for a different reason entirely. Will bears be looking just for the &quot;physical damage&quot; items? The Tanking ring we see linked has a big chunk of defense on it, something bears really won't need at all. It's weird to think about how to resolve the streamlining of itemization across classes (bleah, spirit on my warlock?) with the still-different wants and needs of the classes. Bears will still want to buff dodge, stam, and armor, whereas other tanks will want to buff defense rather than dodge, and rogues don't care at all about dodge. The old way of giving druids very good returns on the Agility investment made a lot of sense that way, but clearly couldn't continue into LK. Still, unless they give druids a parry at least, defense will be a worthless stat for them, and there will clearly be itemization priorities that are unique to the bear. I don't want to have to rely on enchanting/gemming my &quot;rogue&quot; gear for more dodge/stamina as a solution.</div></div><hr />

Suggestion for Riding Crops. make the item a consumable, where it &quot;enchants&quot; the selected mount to give it more speed. downside to it is for people with multiple mounts they'd need to buy more riding crops to enchant other mounts. or make 1 riding crop have like 5 charges or something. but it'S just a suggestion that i'd like to give blizzard.</div></div><hr />

there's a few pieces, but more than likely they were added at the last moment, or even in later patches.<br />
<br />
i know its said more than often around here, but seeing as they make blue posts showing that they are aware of these issues, they likely have some idea of whats going on.<br />
<br />
Im sure they arent gonna put all this work into feral and leave them gimp gear that will end their pve tanking viability.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Actually there's an entire set of &quot;green armor&quot; quest rewards throughout Nagrand, Blade's Edge, Netherstorm, and Shadowmoon Valley for druid tanks. Back when BC came out you needed to get all of them to start tanking Kara, since there were no &quot;green armor&quot; normal or heroic drops, or badge gear.<br />
<br />
I wonder what blizz plans on doing with the old feral tanking gear though. I don't see who you would drop 20,000 armor or more for some agi and stam going from 70-&gt;80. What's stopping feral druids from just using their level 70 tanking gear at 80 to have 36,000 armor (more if you stack it over the level 73 cap)?</div></div><hr />

I hope this is fixed before release otherwise I won't return to WoW</div></div><hr />

Not to poke at you in particular, but I'm getting bored in general with the elitist posting trend about dumbing down WoW. It really doesnt matter if folks used to walk to school uphill both ways everyday. Eliminating *unintended* effects of itemization (or anything else) is the perogative of the developers.<br />
<br />
If they didnt want you to be stuck without 1/2 of your desired trinkets every time a mob or a player yanked you into combat while riding, so be it. It sounds like the intent was that when you invested the money/time to get a riding crop, you were supposed to be able to enjoy its benefits with no trade off--something that is not the case currently. Sure it could remain a risk management decision by the player.... *if* they really ever wanted it to be that at all.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vodalus</div><div class="date">2008-09-03, 01:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think Obliterate just needs to do more damage and Scourge Strike less. They are very similar abilities so it's easy to imagine numbers balanced in such a way that Obliterate is fun for Blood (when you don't need Death Strike) and Scourge Strike is an improvement to Obliterate for Unholy without being the only talent you ever need in that tree.Yeah, they're very similar. Except one is a standard skill and one is a talent -deep- in the Unholy tree. Think maybe that means one should be more powerful?</div></div><hr />

If that is the case how can you be sure any of your other gear is correct.... ::)</div></div><hr />

Makes sure you have the correct items with the best stat spread, automatically choses the best quest reward and rolls on drops for you.<br />
<br />
Pretty seen all you will have to do is select either the tank or the target(auto targeting system?) and click heal or attack.</div></div><hr />
