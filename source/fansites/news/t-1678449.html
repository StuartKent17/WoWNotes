Patch 6.1 - Character Model Changes<br />
Patch 6.1 has fixed bugs, improved models, changed the male Night Elf run animation, and restored some things that were missing from the new character models like spots on Female Tauren, extra eye glow on some Undead Faces, eyeliner from Human Females, excessive eye sagging on Female Gnomes and more. A sample of what has been discovered so far is below.<br />

Patch 6.0.3 Hotfixes - January 12<br />
Looks like the class tuning hotfixes from today are indeed live! - Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/554882412086177793)<br />
Secondary Stats<br />
<br />
The Haste stat is now 11.1% more effective. For example, characters at level 100 now receive a 1% increase per 90 Haste (up from 1% per 100 Haste).<br />
<br />
<br />
Please note that the following class tuning hofixes are not active yet. These hotfixes are still undergoing testing and will be implemented as soon as possible.<br />

Patch 6.1 - Heirlooms Tab<br />
The long awaited heirlooms tab is finally live in Patch 6.1!<br />
<br />
<br />
Heirlooms now scale from 1 to 60 (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items?filter-patch=19445&amp;filter-ilvl-min=85&amp;filter-ilvl-max=85&amp;filter-quality=128)<br />
Heirlooms can be purchased for gold<br />
The new heirlooms can be upgraded by items like Ancient Heirloom Scabbard (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/122339-ancient-heirloom-scabbard) and Timeworn Heirloom Scabbard (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/122341-timeworn-heirloom-scabbard) to Level 90 and Level 100.<br />
Currently, only the Level 90 upgrade is available for purchase and it only upgrades the heirloom to Level 85.<br />
The old heirlooms haven't changed, but with character copy down we aren't sure what will happen to them.<br />
Upon logging on to another character, you can click the heirloom to create one for that character. <br />
Any enchants applied are only applied to that copy of the item and lost upon deleting it.<br />
Heirlooms are still Bind on Account, so you can mail enchanted heirlooms between characters.<br />
<br />

Patch 6.1 - Garrison UI: Mission Remaining Duration<br />
Patch 6.1 adds a timer to let you know how long before a mission will expire!<br />

Current PTR Status 1/12/15<br />
Hi folks,<br />
<br />
Just wanted to share some early information regarding the 6.1 PTR. <br />
<br />
Note: this information is subject to change as plans are implemented. I'll update this thread or make a new one as I receive more information.<br />
<br />
<br />
PTR Accounts and realms are currently locked to Mists of Pandaria. Upgrading the PTR accounts to Warlords is a lengthy process so I don't have an exact ETA, but it's something we're actively working on. In-game Character Copy is currently offline. The plan is still to use the in-game system as opposed to the old website version (which hasn't been functional since 5.4). Characters were wiped after the 6.0.3 PTR realms were brought down last month, and cannot be retrieved at this time.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Patch 6.1 - Death Recap UI<br />
Patch 6.1 will give players a little bit more information about how they died in the default UI.<br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;div class=&quot;gallery&quot; id=&quot;gallery-61deathrecap&quot;&gt;http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2015/january/thumb/deathRecap.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2015/january/deathRecap.jpg) &lt;/div&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
Patch 6.1 - Twitter UI<br />
The toggle for the Twitter integration is in, but it is currently broken. <br />
<br />

WW is one of the worst PvP specs now, and MW (the least broken spec) has it's issues still. It's bad enough that the former WW players are forced to BM in PvP because of the OP Guard procs for your teammates, and because they don't go down faster than tissue paper like how WW does.</div></div><hr />

WW Monks are almost, if not as bad, as Ele Shamans in PvP now. And remember that Ele was considered to be THE worst spec PvE or PvP on WoD's release at 100.</div></div><hr />

Oh I get it, people are just mad because they can't dominate every other class but their own in every aspect of PvP/PvE be it single target/Cleave/Aoe.<br />

Oh you silly goose!<br />
<br />
Frost DK's are arguably the strongest, or at least a top 3 dps class in pvp right now. In terms of burst and overall damage output probably even hold the nr.1 spot.<br />
They are about to get a significant damage buff with those hotfixes.<br />
Discipline priests are without a doubt a bottom tier healing class in pvp right now, arguably the weakest.<br />
They are about to get their main &quot;healing&quot; tool (shield) nerfed by 15%.<br />
<br />
Blizzard does not care about pvp.</div></div><hr />

The expansion came out since then. We're well on our way to 6.1. This major-as-all-hell &quot;hotfix&quot; comes out and still none of them have been addressed. There's still bugs that prevent Zen Sphere from popping. (t100) Chi Explosion is still splitting its healing making it only good in PVP. (t100) Breathe of the Serpent is still healing for basically nothing every 1.5 minutes. I'm honestly shocked. Like, no sarcasm. This is the kind of thing they did several expansions ago to other classes and I'd thought they'd moved on from it. At least bugfix a talent during the same patch when you've known it was broken for months during beta. If nothing else, just that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm almost sure it's a quite big buff. GStance nerf will take away 12.5% of our current DPS. (1.2x goes down to 1.05x) But we get +20% to 40% on almost all our major damage sources. This will be between 2 and 10% buff on bosses depending on how many targets are there.<br />
I guess this was done primarily to address the very poor damage of prot warriors (I mean tanks). As a side effect, glad got better.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Frost DK's are arguably the strongest, or at least a top 3 dps class in pvp right now. In terms of burst and overall damage output probably even hold the nr.1 spot.<br />
They are about to get a significant damage buff with those hotfixes.<br />
Discipline priests are without a doubt a bottom tier healing class in pvp right now, arguably the weakest.<br />
They are about to get their main &quot;healing&quot; tool (shield) nerfed by 15%.<br />
<br />
Blizzard does not care about pvp.<br />

Except DK is the lowest represented class besides monk in 2200+ and 2400+ 3s.<br />

Where in there did you see Ret getting gigantic stat bonus? Its for prot (strange too, as haste is after bonus armor best 2ndary stat for prot dps... already top dps tank and 2k dps less than ret if dpsing as prot)<br />
<br />
Also its quite strange that frostdk is getting huge haste bonus, when frost is already best dps for DK and among best single target dps overall... makes no sense!

No, unholy was far better than frost for dps DK pve, though the bloodboil nerf is going to change this (DW frost overlord inc)...<br />

Frost is also not the best single target dps overall. Not even close <br />

<br />
Second best stat? Haste has been one of the worst stats for prot during this whole expansion. If you take a look at the prot paladins in every top guild non of them are stacking haste, they are avoiding haste! If you visit the main prot teocrafting blog, Sacred Duty (http://www.sacredduty.net/2014/11/26/the-trouble-with-haste/) it will explain why. But now after the buff things might change ofc.<br />
<br />
And no prot is not top tank dps, its good tank dps but not top:<br />
Fight Statistics for Highmaul - Mythic Tank DPS (https://www.warcraftlogs.com/statistics/6#aggregate=amount&amp;class=Tanks&amp;dataset=95)<br />
<br />
And they are a bit over 8k dps behind ret:<br />

You're doing it wrong then. Resto Druid is very strong still.<br />
<br />
You shouldn't be blanketing raid with rejuv or you will go oom. On imperator, just put mushroom under raid, if people set off mines, then that's why you're going to go oom. There shouldn't be any healing to do apart from transition phases and last phase.</div></div><hr />

No, no, dont get me wrong, I can stand my ground against any healer but in certain fights like Imerator where you depend heavily on rejuves it just sux to see the nerf. Do you think the 11% extra haste will mean more heals for us or will it roughly even out?</div></div><hr />

If you want to nerf disc priest, you did in a wrong way. Why the shield? With this nerf you nerfed the PVE disc priests, PVE shadow dmg from reflective shield and nerfed the shadow priests survive at PVP. WHY? You need to BUFF shadow survive not NERF it, jesus. This is bullsh1t.<br />
<br />
I hope they will fix it soon, cause it was the bad idea ever...</div></div><hr />

Frost DK's are arguably the strongest, or at least a top 3 dps class in pvp right now. In terms of burst and overall damage output probably even hold the nr.1 spot.<br />
They are about to get a significant damage buff with those hotfixes.<br />
Discipline priests are without a doubt a bottom tier healing class in pvp right now, arguably the weakest.<br />
They are about to get their main &quot;healing&quot; tool (shield) nerfed by 15%.<br />
<br />
Blizzard does not care about pvp.<br />
<br />
No, they're not. Not top 3, not even nr.1 spot (since rogues could burst you down to the point that they had to nerf one of their CCs when they decided to buff even more their dmg).<br />
<br />
Also, frost dks just go down in a matter of seconds. Don't mix unholy/blood/frost specs when complaining about DKs, also check their gear against yours. If a frost DK can just burst you down to death that fast is because a) he does have far better gear than you, or b) you were almost dead when he attacked you, or c) he wasn't alone and that way any one could have killed you with others.<br />
<br />
It's the same crap of noob players complaining that DKs need nerfs because one DK gripped him and one-shotted him... he only failed to mention that he gripped him while he was sub 20%, the DK just did the killing blow (as any other dps class could easily do) or that he was gripped to the middle of the oposing faction in Ashran...</div></div><hr />

Its for prot (strange too, as haste is after bonus armor best 2ndary stat for prot dps... already top dps tank and 2k dps less than ret if dpsing as prot)<br />
<br />
Also its quite strange that frostdk is getting huge haste bonus, when frost is already best dps for DK and among best single target dps overall... makes no sense! But they do have a lot of downtime, same as other classes that are getting haste boost so i can see logic behind it... but without other hotfixes(nerfs), it will push them over the top in dps... expecting more hotfixes in coming days to balance for that<br />
<br />
Since you can't reforge anymore and nobody would ever gem haste for Frost spec, there isn't a need to nerf to compensate (or it wouldn't fix anything).<br />
<br />
It's a spec that need haste (specially 2H frost) because of the old class mechanics that are a problem nowadays, so right now with all the changes in WoD, they've got a huge downtime (wich also shows how it can't be the top pvp spec of all classes, while others are there hitting things non-stop, you're there auto-attacking waiting a long time for resources. That means you need to align all the starts together with your team to actually do something... but that also means any other class/spec would be better for the team than you). The reason people won't just go and gear for haste is that it also badly need other stats to do proper dps (like multistrike, mastery...). And as I said, no reforge anymore. The current gear itemization isn't that great for Frost 2H for example. They could nerf something if we see a better itemization in BFR and next tier(s).<br />
<br />
Good thing they're recognizing that some specs need that kind of fix (and they're not updating the class mechanics, like DK class).<br />
<br />
Also, frost isn't the best single-target dps, and not better than Unholy (actually Unholy is a better dps spec right now for any scenario, you go frost because you like it, not because it's the best right now and it's still scalling worse than Unholy with better gear).</div></div><hr />

People usually compare with their own experience, their friends, their small raid groups, lfr, etc. where anything can happens, including a bad ret paladin struggling to win the prot paladin. Or someone with better gear than him owning everything, but he didn't check their gear, etc.<br />

<br />
Yes it is... logs prove it! 2H Frost is best single target dk spec... and that is by far... no need to discuss the facts :P<br />
Also, haste boost is the biggest boost to 2H frost too... and blood boil nerf is huge nerf for UH... so predicted results of hotfixes are 2H frost ST, DW frost for cleave... unholy only for sustained aoe</div></div><hr />

The expansion came out since then. We're well on our way to 6.1. This major-as-all-hell &quot;hotfix&quot; comes out and still none of them have been addressed. There's still bugs that prevent Zen Sphere from popping. (t100) Chi Explosion is still splitting its healing making it only good in PVP. (t100) Breathe of the Serpent is still healing for basically nothing every 1.5 minutes. I'm honestly shocked. Like, no sarcasm. This is the kind of thing they did several expansions ago to other classes and I'd thought they'd moved on from it. At least bugfix a talent during the same patch when you've known it was broken for months during beta. If nothing else, just that.<br />
<br />
Four months? Oh my, my, my, four whole months. You should look at the Death Knight forums, we haven't seen a dev in years.

<br />
str &gt; bonus armor &gt; haste &gt; multistrike &gt; crit &gt; versatility &gt; mastery for prot dps... thats a fact... if you dont believe me, feel free to sim it yourself<br />
prot dps is already 1-2k behind ret dps on single target at the moment, with haste boost to prot and in general more haste per rating... its going to be even closer, maybe even go over ret... that is untill T17 set bonuses come in play, then prot dps is dead<br />
<br />
SW, ES, seraphim build with harsh words, focused shield and final wrath sims 900dps behind ret at 670ilvl and 1.6k under ret at 685ilvl before haste buff... and that is for dpsing as prot, at the back, not tanking obviously... with my APL and ret using solscras... so unoptimized vs optimized and still so close<br />
<br />
also according to your link, prot paly tank is also the best dps... only reason why they are not first when you combine all bosses is because of imperator add whoring... and DKs that dominate mass aoe fights are going to drop with blood boil nerf! Prot are among the top or top on all bosses other than imperator pretty much... with prot paly being ALL top dps on butcher</div></div><hr />

<br />
So, yeah, I would say the excessively high cost of many items (like the Alliance chopper and heirlooms) - is a way to increase Blizzard revenue in the future. The cost of heirlooms is two fold - it is because they want more high cost gold sinks in the game to increase the demand for their future subscription tokens, and because it high heirloom costs encourage people to pay for level 90 boosts instead.</div></div><hr />

They can never fix the boar mount run animation, they would have to redo the entire model. Run speed is standard across all mounts, boars have very tiny legs.

Sure they can, after saddling us with crappy ingame models for mounts, they then follow up by making more awesome looking mounts and sell those in the store instead! It's great tactic</div></div><hr />

First of all, no i don't think paying around 5k for a set that will last you 100 lvls is expensive.<br />
<br />
Second, if you used to pay justice points for heirlooms, then you will already have a bunch of them and therefor won't need to buy them all from scratch.<br />
<br />
Third, the difference between having heirlooms in only important slots compared to having all them is marginal, and will probably only ever get noticed in pvp.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You missed my point. There is no possible way they can fix the boar ´animation´. They could change the boar model completely, or they could make the entire boar mount bigger ( and thus be able to slow down its legs), but they can´t change the animation to make it look better. It is always going to look stupid because tiny tiny legs need to cover a large area.<br />
<br />
There are like 250 mounts in the game, use another if it is totally unacceptable to you.</div></div><hr />

The Human female faces and the Dwarf female face in specific look absolutely fantastic. Such a big improvement, so much closer to the original now. The female Draenei eyes also look so much better now, not so &quot;bulby&quot; and lifeless. I also greatly appreciate the implementation of the old female Tauren fur patterns. <br />

I still hope that more will be done for the Gnome females (correct eye colors, and some previously nice faces look so angry and bitter now), but now I'm hopeful, my faith is restored.</div></div><hr />

NE male run is ok, but I liked the bouncy run much better. It's the faces and casting animations (inherited from the old models) that bug me. The faces look as though they're made of plasticine.<br />

Re: the class changes, these will be iterative, so I wouldn't get too fussed if your spec doesn't show yet. Destro, demo and fire were anticipated to receive buffs, and arguably will see more tuning done to them as they're very middle of the road ATM. I wouldn't be surprised to see frost and arcane receive some too down the road, although PVP-wise DF is getting buffed back to where it should be and PoM will synergise again with Poly. Both were dumb changes, so it's nice to see them being (partially) reversed.</div></div><hr />

Since most put enchants on the boa's now, its pointless for having the tab for them then if they'll have to re-enchant them if the copies are deleted. This means we still have to clutter our bank tab(s) to keep the enchants on the gear as that can get expensive if they have to be applied each time we want to make a new character.

No way man, the current one is ridiculous lol. Dont get me wrong, I like the bounce everyone has now, it feels like a disney movie. But the male NE run is TOO bouncy, and too fast and exaggerated. As soon as you have any run speed they become this ridiculous blur and they stand out like a sore thumb. The new one will be far more in line with the other new run animations.<br />

Exactly. It's weird that they're so flat on top and so round at the bottom. Plus eyes are usually wider on the outside, not the inside. It looks weird. Also, the face looks like it has no expression at all. It's just like... a blank stare :/</div></div><hr />

The change in eyebrows to that female dwarf in the screenshot make her look a LOT better (though I don't know how the old model looked). I think many other models can use a little tweak like that away from freakin' crazy (especially eyebrows) towards normalcy.<br />

<br />
What they said was that the Goblins/Worgens are still using the old model rig which the old models used, and so would require an update to bring them up to the fidelity of the Pandaren rig on onwards. However, they have no immediate plans to update them but it is something they would like to do eventually.</div></div><hr />

Not top 3, not even nr.1 spot (since rogues could burst you down to the point that they had to nerf one of their CCs when they decided to buff even more their dmg).<br />
<br />
Also, frost dks just go down in a matter of seconds. Don't mix unholy/blood/frost specs when complaining about DKs, also check their gear against yours. If a frost DK can just burst you down to death that fast is because a) he does have far better gear than you, or b) you were almost dead when he attacked you, or c) he wasn't alone and that way any one could have killed you with others.<br />
<br />
It's the same crap of noob players complaining that DKs need nerfs because one DK gripped him and one-shotted him... he only failed to mention that he gripped him while he was sub 20%, the DK just did the killing blow (as any other dps class could easily do) or that he was gripped to the middle of the oposing faction in Ashran...<br />
<br />
You have got to be kidding me. If you are saying that a DK, Frost or otherwise die within seconds, then you are bad or a troll.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Human Male; Could have more different facial features and I did like the spikey beard to. <br />
<br />
Draenei Male; The beard options could be fixed with a few tweaking here and there. Not sure with the rest though. <br />
<br />
Orc Female; Some improvements and really want to see the Orc Male changes if there is any. <br />
<br />
Tauren Female; Hope the old pattern for the new model stays, and we got spots for another skin tonne for Tauren. <br />
<br />
Undead Male; What if I want a glowing eye with that featured face? Please make it still a option Blizzard. Close eye and open eye. Two eye faces for the price of one. :3 <br />
<br />
Dwarf Female; Look sexier...&quot;Ya lass. Gonna show ya a good time I will!&quot; says the Dwarf Male. <br />
<br />
Gnome Female; More slight changes, but nothing too amazing. Hope we get our happy Gnome faces back well with the grumpy faces of course. <br />
<br />
Draenei Female; Eyes are slightly adjusted, and that is just about it. <br />
<br />
So anyway just a little fixes here and there, but will we ever get more customizations for Character Models? <br />
Like having a brown skin Orc, a Dragonmaw skin one, scars on the sides and tattoos? My Orc character would like it. <br />
Dwarves could also have tattoos for their Wildhammer cousins and even have a more orange colour for their hair colour and Dark Iron could have the dark skin with modifying eyes. <br />
Draenei could have Broken, while Gnomes could have more Sand Gnomes in their mix, and Humans having more features to make them more unique.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ravenmoon</div><div class="date">2015-01-14, 03:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">for 6.1 I hope they just focus on more model changes. fixes and corrections, the stuff in so far is good, but a lot of tidying up needs to be done, and now is probably the best time to iron out all the kinks they had to rush on previously to make launch deadline can now be done probably The last model released, the night elf male, was clearly and easily seen as the least complete, and funnily it didn't change at all since its debut except a slight texture update on one of the facial hair options.<br />
<br />
So come 6.1, it is no surprise that night elves are looking for a lot of adjustments. like they've done to the run, especially errors. In fact, there was nothing wrong with the running animation, it was just different, some people liked it, but many did not, not relating to the new super bounce, but some loved it. I like the modified version better.<br />
<br />
example<br />
<br />
low rez/low def textures<br />
wrong coloured beard/hair combos<br />
missing animations/emote expressions<br />
mis-aligned symmetry<br />
shoulder broken animations<br />
still the no beard option that still has no eyebrows - recognized at blizzcon as an error.<br />
the off-centred collar bone alignemnt<br />
untidied eye texture - looks like his skin is peeled back on the right eye a little and an extra crack has come through<br />
they still feel a lot rushed compared to the older ones, and nothing has changed there.<br />
their textures are still fuzzy in comparison to say dwarf and orc models and even night elf female models.<br />
shoulder items do not align properly<br />
unarmed attack unfinished animation (still skips frames on the l ower left arm)<br />
migraine headache casting has to go or look better even though it's improved over the old model, it's still bad<br />
mind flay channel animation semes focused on the left palm rather than the middle of the two hands<br />
shoulders are scaled so large to the point of insane animation clipping.<br />
mentioned the new models look LESS attractive than the old even though they are better textured, who ends up looking uglier on their new models? i mean, - COME ON !!<br />
I still do not agree with the move to have 7/9 really old faces, they should cut back the wrinkles on at least 4 more faces, more like 2 old, 7 young not 2 young, 7 old - or change the female Nelves and blood elf males to reflect accordingly<br />
Super exaggerated hands -even moreso than usual, and yet a really really tiny waist that makes him look like he has no penis, especially as his hands can literally wrap around his waist - that's too exaggerated to the point of bad, and not eccentric.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
So, yeah, I would say the excessively high cost of many items (like the Alliance chopper and heirlooms) - is a way to increase Blizzard revenue in the future. The cost of heirlooms is two fold - it is because they want more high cost gold sinks in the game to increase the demand for their future subscription tokens, and because it high heirloom costs encourage people to pay for level 90 boosts instead.<br />
<br />
If you're talking about the credd/plex thing they're doing you have no fucking clue what you're talking about. Selling gold is going into the blizzard store and buying 1k gold for $1. That's not what they're doing, at all. Get a clue.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you truly think they look better now compared to what they are changing them to you need your head examined. You may be suffering from dementia. <br />
<br />
The textures they are releasing are how they should have looked BEFORE the expac released. What we have NOW is a rush job, plain and simple. I am GLAD these are changing as they look more similar to what we had before the changes to the new models. njow all I need is for body parts to not clip through armor and im set on the model front.<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
The human male looks a little bit better. Still looks like all the hair is glued to the head, but a little less so. I don't even have any human males but it bugs the hell out of me.<br />
If that Draenei female face change is legit... what the hell? Why?<br />
I didn't think there was really anything wrong with most of the human female faces but they look a bit better now I guess? I'm sure people will complain that it doesn't make sense that they have all this makeup on now though. (And to be honest it really doesn't make sense but I don't care.)<br />
<br />
Its more inline to the way the textures were on the old models. Those had shading that one would call eyeshadow and eyeliner. It only makes sense that the newer updated textures take that into account. the new ones are more like the old. A lot closer to what was promised at blizzcon regarding model changes, but still far enough away to need more changes. the eyebrows are still uneven, the right eyebrow is higher than the left on a lot of the faces and they are still too high.<br />
<br />
Why don't they just get some women into the art teams cubicles and let them see how a womans looks with makeup on. :p<br />

<br />
Human is the most played race, so there's your answer. Also belves are Coming in 6.1, and Worgen/goblin won't happen so.<br />

Unless they plan to change mutant chihuahua head i could care less about worgen getting updated.<br />

Oh joy, just what human females needed, clown make-up, I want to keep the no make-up look. :(<br />

<br />
Yes - this. For some reason male trolls now run like female WNBA players - needs fixing.<br />
<br />
And while we're at it - male orc heads are now too big for their bodies. A quick A/B comparison shows that those huge, new underslung jaws now hang down to where the old orc necks used to be. The result is a creature that looks too top-heavy to even stand on two legs.</div></div><hr />
