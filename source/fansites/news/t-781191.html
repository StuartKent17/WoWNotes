One of Azeroth’s oldest adversaries will soon tear through the Elemental Plane to reforge the world in flame, but this foe won’t be conducting his reign of terror from the confines of a castle or lair. Deathwing is a destructive force the likes of which adventurers have yet to see in World of Warcraft, and his appetite for devastation can only be satisfied by the shattering of the world. Following his explosive escape from Deepholm, Deathwing will cast a deadly shadow over the people of Azeroth as he wreaks indiscriminate havoc across the land.<br />
<br />
Once free to terrorize the world, Deathwing will randomly choose territories in Azeroth to attack each day until his ruinous reign is brought to an end. A blackened sky will be the only warning before every living creature caught in his approach is consumed by his terrible fire. The unfortunate victims of his malice will receive a rare Feat of Strength... as well as a repair bill and corpse run.<br />
<br />
When Deathwing returns, you'd best keep your eyes on the skies. <br />
<br />
Here is a short video of the beta servers uploaded by Marla on Youtube.<br />

Because we all know that the way things first appear in beta is the way things stay when they go live, right?<br />

Speaking of which, is anyone else disappointed that Cho'gall doesn't have any animations! I mean, I saw the beta videos and he just stands there the entire fight! It's so obvious that he will stay this way until it goes live!</div></div><hr />

I am surprised at the failure of basic reading as well..<br />
<br />
<br />
Once free to terrorize the world, Deathwing will randomly choose territories in Azeroth to attack each day until his ruinous reign is brought to an end.<br />
<br />
Meaning this will most likely be happening every day from 4.0.3 when Deathwing erupts from the ground to the day he is finally killed.<br />
<br />
As for this..<br />
<br />
Flooding<br />
<br />
so when will this start happening? <br />
<br />
The world changes will be occuring with patch 4.0.3 a short time before Cataclysm is released to the stores.</div></div><hr />

This has happened to me in beta, trust me, it's a lot more exciting than the video looks. The sky turns blood red, everything goes dark, and REALLY LOUDLY, Deathwing starts to yell across the zone. I was questing in Uldum at the time (a week or so back) and it scared the SHIT out of me. It was also sort of because I didn't expect it at all, though..</div></div><hr />

<br />
I imagine that this will happen throughout the expansion until the patch that releases Deathwing's raid.<br />
That wouldn't exactly make the feat of strength achievement &quot;rare&quot; as the blue says.<br />
Azeroth currently has, not counting cities, 44 zones. That's a 2.27% chance of being in the right zone at the right time. Not to mention, there are more zones coming with Cataclysm. Throw that and the time between attacks in as factors, and the chance of getting killed by Deathwing drops faster than a drunk on the live end of a Taser.<br />
<br />
Besides, we don't even know the timing between attacks yet. What if it's once a day, or once every 4 hours with a ±2 hour variable? Anyone who's farmed for the TLPD (http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=32491) knows the headaches that Blizz's random spawn timer can cause.<br />
<br />
This is not going to affect anyone's gameplay or wallet, and is quite deserving of the FoS.<br />

Question Zarhym was answering...<br />
<br />
So does this mean he's going to strafe zones all through Cataclysm until the 4.x patch when he's killable and he's dropped on a realm sometime?<br />
<br />
Zarhym's answer bolded for emphasis<br />
<br />
[b]Yes[b],this isn't a permanent event, but will last so long as he's free to roam the world.<br />
<br />
<br />
So to me that says he will be doing this until he is killed by someone on the realms.Hence,it not being permanant in that sense since it will end when he is killed.<br />
<br />

<br />
Awesome!!!! They should include a voice with it...like a yell or something &quot;Azoroth feel my wrath as your world burns! hahahaha!&quot; or something like that. thatd be soo cool!</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">PlatedPriest</div><div class="date">2010-10-27, 03:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Azeroth currently has, not counting cities, 44 zones. That's a 2.27% chance of being in the right zone at the right time. Not to mention, there are more zones coming with Cataclysm. Throw that and the time between attacks in as factors, and the chance of getting killed by Deathwing drops faster than a drunk on the live end of a Taser.<br />
<br />
Besides, we don't even know the timing between attacks yet. What if it's once a day, or once every 4 hours with a ±2 hour variable? Anyone who's farmed for the TLPD (http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=32491) knows the headaches that Blizz's random spawn timer can cause.<br />
<br />
This is not going to affect anyone's gameplay or wallet, and is quite deserving of the FoS.<br />

I, for one, cannot wait.:D<br />

The video isn't a good representation, really. I got on the beta the other day for maybe 10 minutes to mess around in Uldum for a bit when he showed up. He makes a big announcement, with voice acting, and the skies turn dark as you can see and there's a bunch of rushing winds and whatnot. I hadn't heard of anything like this, and hadn't really played any WoW in ages, but was pleasantly surprised when this happened. I imagine there's not a lot of good videos out for it tho since you can't really prepare yourself to record it without knowing any sort of set pathing or timeframe.</div></div><hr />

Constantly breathing fire? Well its understandable, but alteast make it look natural. Slow ass movement and flapping wings like idiot? I SURE DO HOPE he learns to FLY, unlike his successors.<br />

Im not saying it sucks, in fact I LOVE the idea, its awesome. I just think they could add a little more details to it, just to spice it up a little so its a bit more FRIGHTENING you know? I mean, its DEATHWING! =D<br />

At least make it look legit, not some 5 mph moving dragon with the only change in the zones is a little fire thrown onto of unchanged textures. Never the less, it is still the beta, let's hope, I mean really really hope that come live, this event will be a crazy ton more epic than this piece of crap that I just watched for a minute and forty three seconds.</div></div><hr />

If you don't notice the sky turning dark and him yelling or the big dragon coming your way, sorry but you kinda deserve to die.</div></div><hr />

For ONE MONTH.. not even, and just like the Zombie Invasion, there are plenty of other places to be in than where Deathwing will be.</div></div><hr />

Not to mention standing in said fire. God forbid the villain kills you, he is just there for being sparkly and handing you out purples right?</div></div><hr />

I heard that if you read the other comments, or just use your brain the least little bit, you'd know that the chances of DW hitting the zone you're in is at about 2%. Since he's highly unlikely to do this every five minutes (most likely a 4-24 hour timer like most spawns) your chance of being hit by this *ever*, let alone often enough to be annoying, are pretty slim. Jesus people will whine about anything.</div></div><hr />

<br />
deathwing is going to make devilsaurs look like amateurs<br />
<br />
<br />
It's more like you will be questing in un'goro, a devilsaur sneaks up on you and jumps you, and then deathwing comes by and annihilates both of you, and when you release the devilsaur is in the gy with you and says 'man, thats some fucked up shit, nerf please'</div></div><hr />

If only it would fly across the map at high speeds launching fire to the ground, then at least it would instill a little bit of fear, instead of its current flying over at a snails pace.</div></div><hr />

Makes me wonder why Blizzard even bothers with these World Events. If I was in there place and every time I tried to do anything special I got nothing but crying and moaning in return, I would give up real fast.<br />
<br />
I think it looks amazing and cannot wait to see him in action.<br />
Or, if you would be worth anything, you would eat that feedback up and pump out something better. If everyone would be vomiting sunshine onto Blizzard for everything they do, they wouldn't want to do anything better. The current event looks very bland and boring.<br />
<br />
Oh, and they bother with these world events because that earns them more money. They're still a company.</div></div><hr />

Don't worry. Even gnome will handle it. It may be hard to tank in heroic, but in normal it will be farmed just like LK is.</div></div><hr />

I mean, they wanted to use Real ID in the forums, there was overwhelming resentment to the idea.<br />
<br />
Can't help but think their way of getting around it is by saying &quot;look we're using a NEW website, with NEW rules.&quot;<br />
Hm.<br />
<br />
They threw out that idea...what are you concerned about, exactly? I'd rather have something tighter moderated than the current cess-pit, tbh. It's got better of late since they chucked out some of the troublemakers, but if it makes it a more pleasant place to be occasionally then it will be worth all the hassle. I think climbing down from the Real ID fiasco (though as someone with a publicly visible Facebook account I couldn't have cared less about it) was a good idea, but for what it's worth, the game needs serious regulation in some areas and the forums are one place where it won't come too soon. I enjoy the community aspect of games; since I discovered the internet I've been posting on forums, and the WoW forums are worse by far than a lot of other places even though the subject of conversation is less important than some communities I've been a part of over the years. If Blizzard want to clean up they could do a lot worse.<br />
<br />
The style of the Starcraft forums is nice and I'm looking forward to being able to uprate good posts. It's in the community's interests that Blizzard don't let their forums become a place simply to breed trolls but make them a strong and supportive community. A lot of third-party forums are much better moderated without becoming opinion-free zones, and in my experience of other large companies' forums they very seldom become places where no criticism is permitted of the entity around which they have formed (if only, sometimes).<br />
<br />
I think the most pernicious aspect has been addressed and I hope the new forums promote and encourage good manners if not entirely extinguish hot debate. I'm looking forward to using them.</div></div><hr />
