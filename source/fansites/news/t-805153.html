Only because its a worldwide midnight launch, because most EU Countries are in a completely different timezone, its midnight there first.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Correct me if I'm wrong, but it's not a worldwide midnight launch and the servers go live with the Cataclysm patch at midnight PST time, not midnight relative to whatever timezone your server is. I thought all servers were going live at that time, so the count down times should be the same.<br />
<br />
Edit: I was right and wrong. It's not a worldwide midnight release but it is going live at different times for EU than for everyone else...<br />
<br />
&quot;Americas, Australia, New Zealand, and Southeast Asia - December 7 at 12:01 a.m. PST Europe and Russia - December 7 at 12:01 a.m. CET&quot;</div></div><hr />

For the US servers you're right.<br />
The EU servers go life at midnight Greenwich time<br />

And to those QQing about the launch time think about it this way<br />
<br />
You get your copy BEFORE the game goes live. That means you can install it and have it good to go at midnight PST. The west coast suckers have to WAIT until midnight to even BUY the game, then they have to get home and then they have to install it.</div></div><hr />

You do realize Blizzard is an American company right? This gets really annoying every time a patch comes out when the obnoxious bunch on both sides of the Atlantic gripe and moan. Who cares...really? Honestly, how many in game right now still talk about the World first guild who got Naxx (Ver 2), OS, or Maly? None except for a few of their epeen flexing fan boys, their own members, or those that are just trying to get a rise out of other people. <br />
<br />
Oh noes, EU has a 9 hour head start on US/Lat Am/Aus/NZ. Great...they get a head start in QQing about quest mobs being ninja'd, new quests being broke, or the new instances bugging out. <br />
<br />

But it really doesn't matter that much<br />

On topic:<br />
<br />
The real race will be in week 2. Every top guild will 25 man raid this week, and clean everything.<br />
Only the week after, when they start doing hardmodes, will it get interesting.<br />
<br />
So sure, I except an EU guild to get the 1st kill of cho;gall in normal mode. But that it not really important. What is important is who kills him in heroic, and also sinestra.<br />

<br />
isn't Blizzard (now Activision Blizzard, Inc but still existing as separate entities) owned by a parent company Vivendi Games [previously Vivendi Universal Games] (French) with controlling shares (52%). <br />
<br />
Although Blizzard can control the cataclysm and lore (deathwing a puppet of an old god again, haven't seen that one before), i doubt they have the ability to move the earths rotation so that the Americans can get midnight before the rest of the world, would be quite a feat of strength.<br />
<br />
great info though :) nice links everywhere. Can't believe the amount of bannings because of the Euro V American thing. I actually don't like being called european, hell i have to attempt to keep a straight face because my passport says &quot;british&quot;. I'm scottish...if only we actually talked like dwarves in this game (which seem to be scandinavian putting on fake scottish accents). And i like Americans, generally because Pepsi still refuses to sell Mountain Dew in the UK (although you can get it) and i can never help myself as soon as i touch down in the US to visit cinnabon. mmm... lovely. the actual people are fine too ;) Seattle is like Scotland but everywhere is cheaper and they can't play baseball ! :P what? you seen the mariners.. lol</div></div><hr />

Well, fact is Blizzard is owned by Vivendi, and Vivendi got their headquarters in Paris, France.<br />
<br />
I agree with everyone that says that it doesnt matter where Cata is released first, but that Blizzard is 100% ran by Americans isnt really true. Seriously people, its 9 hours and im pretty sure we will have Cata for over a year :)</div></div><hr />

does ppl remember that dailies got nerfed on 4.0.1... so dont expect good exp.. for sure will waste more time turning the quest for ~300k exp that is will be useless since lvls will be of 6m+ exp(@83+)...<br />

<br />
LOL yeah, free Healthcare. <br />
<br />
Let me educate people a little about the EU free healthcare. It's free...but that is a good and a bad thing. By being free they have to look for ways to cut corners. Just like the medicaid system in America. It won't pay for you to have fillings put into your teeth, but it will pay for them to get cut out. Yes, it's an odd system. Of course what you won't see much of on the news, but it's pretty funny to med students, is the advanced medical research going on in the EU...oh wait. <br />
<br />
That's right, if they want an experimental drug, guess where they go. If they have a new treatment 9 times out of 10 they are coming to America asking to use it. Now I don't have anything against EU. They are pretty cool, but if you want to bring up your free healthcare I will educate you about the many failings of it. For example the reason you have most of the medicines that you offer for free is because in America we don't. The companies here make money, and then put that money into research. It's really a shame that we give the tech out for free also. Does it make sense that American's have to pay for the medicines, to advance research, so that the research can be given out to other countries? The reality is though only by charging are you going to have advances in medicine. <br />
<br />
When I finish my education I will donate time at a clinic once a month. The fact is though I will want to feed my wife, and my kids, and my cat. I will want to provide them with a nice place to live, that is secure, I will want them to have nice clothes, goto a good school where they aren't surrounded by rap, and drug dealers. All of that cost money, so I will go to wherever pays me. Currently that is America, because other countries are all about the &quot;free&quot; healthcare. Then wonder why they can't get any doctors...oh let's think about it. <br />
<br />
Oh, and in addition to things you obviously love to complain about American's yet can't get enough of : Movies, Video Games (both online and offline), Food (you can't deny it), Music (love all the EU pale imitations of real music face it we've had the best since Elvis) Software (you know you use windows) etc. <br />
<br />
So hate all you want, but keep paying and QQ about American's to someone that cares.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Haha, without the viking myths about Orcs etc. You wouldn't even be playing WoW kid. Grow the fuck up. <br />
<br />
Actually the orcs in this video game are much more closely related to Japanese Oni. So please go learn something before trying to talk down to people better than you. <br />
<br />
Oh, yeah links. <br />
<br />
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oni_%28folklore%29<br />
<br />
In addition to that isn't the word Orc an invention of one J.R.R. Tolkien. So I went and looked this up:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
# s, as far as I am concerned, actually derived from Old English orc 'demon', but only because of its phonetic suitability&quot;[4]<br />
# &quot;I originally took the word from Old English orc (Beowulf 112 orc-neas and the gloss orc = þyrs ('ogre'), heldeofol ('hell-devil')). This is supposed not to be connected with modern English orc, ork, a name applied to various sea-beasts of the dolphin order.&quot;[5]<br />
# &quot;The word used in translation of Q urko, S orch is Orc. But that is because of the similarity of the ancient English word orc, 'evil spirit or bogey', to the Elvish words. There is possibly no connection between them. The English word is now generally supposed to be derived from Latin Orcus.&quot;[6]<br />
# &quot;Orc I derived from Anglo-Saxon, a word meaning demon, usually supposed to be derived from the Latin Orcus – Hell. But I doubt this, though the matter is too involved to set out here&quot;.[7]<br />

I think you are the closet racist there buddy. You naturally make the assumption that anyone doing drugs, and listening to rap is black. I don't. I've seen them of all types, and I don't want to have to live around that trash, nor do I want my family to live around it. Maybe you should stop projecting.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My country..yes that's why I wrote I would go to wherever I would get paid the best. Unless you are saying that where I will always get paid the best is my country. <br />
<br />
While Greed and selfishness are negative to you , can you deny they have positive impacts? If a wealthy pharmaceutical company invents a new drug out of greed, does their negative greed make it any less positive to a parent when that drugs saves the life of their child? Is that why the drug company did it? Yes, because if they don't make drugs that save then they won't get paid. So while Greed may be negative to you, the positive effects it has are still there. This is hardly the place for such a philosophical discussion, but feel free to send me a private message. I generally always respond, unless you spell what as &quot;wut&quot;. Then I will probably just ignore you.</div></div><hr />

no Blizz started as Silicon and Synapse based out of California in the early 90s I think. I'm pretty sure anyway. That was before they did Warcraft O&amp;H though. Now Activision is majorly owned by Vivendi which is french.<br />
<br />
<br />
Blizzard has changed hands several times since then: Davidson was acquired along with Sierra On-Line by a company called CUC International in 1996; CUC then merged with a hotel, real-estate, and car-rental franchiser called HFS Corporation to form Cendant in 1997. In 1998 it became apparent that CUC had engaged in accounting fraud for years before the merger; Cendant's stock lost 80% of its value over the next six months in the ensuing widely discussed accounting scandal. The company sold its consumer software operations, Sierra On-line which included Blizzard, to French publisher Havas in 1998, the same year Havas was purchased by Vivendi. Blizzard was part of the Vivendi Games group of Vivendi. In July 2008 Vivendi Games merged with Activision, using Blizzard's name in the resulting company, Activision Blizzard.<br />

Oh and guys whats all the QQ about American / eu who cares its a game we all play it and all enjoy it :) I'm from the eu and im perfectly happy with us getting it first but i would also be happy if the us got it first.

You know what, I'm from America. If you are QQing that EU gets a head start then you need to get a life. Seriously is it really going to hurt anyone? Oh no they get a few hours, well big freaking deal. <br />
<br />
Anyway I completely agree with you man. I'm happy you guys get a head start. It would be really annoying if I were in EU and it launched at like 3 a.m. or something. I personally think it was a smart move of them. It makes me sad though that I will see other people from this country complaining about something they should be cheering for. That is fairness. It really is only fair they get to start at a relative time.</div></div><hr />

This company has been performing such tests roughly every two years, sadly they have so far been unsuccessful, comment: &quot;We will not give up, we already have plans to distribute the load by letting the Horde log in one week in advance&quot;. Maybe next time, keep it up boys!<br />
<br />
Next up we have a so called hacker who is strangely fond of... kittens! A possible weakness? Stay tuned!</div></div><hr />
