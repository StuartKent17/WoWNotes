<br />
Q. When will my realm be connected?<br />
A. We'll try to keep you posted on the latest schedules as we get them.<br />
<br />
Q. My realm has a lower population than those on the list, why isn’t mine being connected first?<br />
A. The order we connect realms depends on a number of technical factors, but we will get to them all.<br />
<br />

<br />
FAQ<br />
<br />
Q. My realm needs connecting, why isn’t it listed?<br />
A. The connections listed are the phases we’ve currently finalized and have planned connection dates or estimates available for. Additional connections are possible, but they just haven’t reached that stage yet. We’ll be updating the realm connection list as phases complete and new phases are planned.<br />
<br />
Q. When will my realm be connected?<br />
A. We'll update this thread with the latest information on currently planned phases.<br />
<br />
Q. My realm has a lower population than those on the list, why isn’t mine being connected first?<br />
A. Realm connections are based on a number of factors including population, faction balance, the realm’s physical location in the world compared to other realms it may be connected to, among others. It’s also worth noting that websites which attempt to track population, while helpful in many ways, are estimates based on public data which may not provide the clearest picture of actual population.<br />

Blue Tweets<br />
Warlords of Draenor Stats<br />
With Crit being on gear much more often in WOD are there any plans for making Crit better for Elemental with no reforging?<br />
A) Where did you get that Crit will be on gear much more often? B) We're considering some changes, but nothing to announce yet. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/408789920098971648))<br />
<br />
Will tertiary stats appear on PvP gear in WoD? Sockets etc. are supposed to appear randomly, though, so...<br />
We're talking about it still. If PvP gear doesn't have it, then PvE gear becomes better by default. (Source (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/410518050819936257))<br />
Wish we could chose our tertiary stats on PvP gear, kinda like reforging but for 100% value...<br />
Keep in mind that tertiary stats are intended to be very rare. So, whatever the PvP design, the rarity would match PvE. (Source (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/410566262138208256))<br />
<br />
What about removing Spirit and let Haste be the main factor of mana regen? Throwing ideas around. @Celestalon<br />
Spirit's value varies significantly between classes. One contributor is what the other secondaries do for regen. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/409907822252412928))<br />
We're looking at potential changes in that regard, to standardize that better between classes. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/409907928208916480))<br />
<br />
What will you do with hit, exp etc in 6.0? Convert to other stats or just remove them?<br />
Convert them to other stats. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/415959639373524992))<br />
What about Spirit? On clothes? On Jewelry? Some DPS casters are using them on rings/neck at least.<br />
No spirit on armor may involve increasing the amount of spirit on non-armor. That makes it more complex to change existing armor. We recognize the problem and are planning potential solutions, but aren't ready to give specifics yet. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/416680961342857216))<br />
Wouldn't increasing the amount of regen spirit gives instead avoid that issue?<br />
That may be part of it, but we may change how we itemize non-armor pieces. Just complicates the issue. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/416698025877065728))<br />
If healers have enough regen with 1-2 spirit pieces in first raid tier, what happens to mana regen later on?<br />
&quot;Enough&quot; is a very ethereal concept. It also varies with other gear. And definitely not from 1-2 items in the first tier. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/416860892853047297))<br />
Then between 3 and 6 (of 7) slots. If item stats triple again, will only need max 2 spirit pieces in final tier. Also, sockets.<br />
Sounds like you're ignoring the fact that &quot;enough&quot; changes between tiers. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/417078989790789633))<br />
<br />
Warlords of Draenor PvE<br />
... or the difference between LFR/normal/hc/mythic could also be a tad lower, like 10 itemlevels instead of the current 13.<br />
A larger gap between tiers allows us to have bosses that test performance more. It also makes upgrades &quot;feel&quot; noticeable. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/410886682435543040))<br />
<br />
you know how battle rez will work in normal/heroic? 3 regardless of size like current flex?<br />
We're investigating some possible solutions. We want to make it scale by size, but know that breakpoints are not the answer. It ... (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/416689659150741504))<br />
... may be an opportunity to solve some other problems with the system, like # available being hidden, and the # being the same ... (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/416690207019110400))<br />
... on short vs long fights. We don't have details to share yet, but those are concerns we're thinking about. May not fix all those (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/416690586876268545))<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
Why not go GW2 sPvP style? They made it all skill based and still rewarding. Cooler looking gear as you progress.<br />
The Trial of the Gladiator is our plan for a &quot;gearless&quot; PvP ecosystem. 0% chance we're removing gear in PvP overall. (Source (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/417394936510574592))<br />
<br />
Any chance PvP trinket will have a unique sound in the near future?<br />
Excellent idea. Thanks for pointing it out. (Source (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/417150092844339201))<br />
Definitely a great idea!<br />
Well, the proper authorities have been notified! (Source (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/417241995300466688))<br />
<br />
ok death grip bugs on tolviron and shado pan for over a year now 100% chance when target is next to a wall. Why are you ignoring it<br />
We'll have to follow up on it. It requires geometry and collision work. We've discussed it before. (Source (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/417154026115854338))<br />
<br />
Please encourage pvp participation in random bgs with CP, 100 when you win and 50 when you lose. I hate Arenas and Rbgs.<br />
I could see doing something similar to what we do in RBGs (base on final score). Would have to give it more thought. (Source (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/417153763955077123))<br />
<br />
winning one awarded 5,6 or 7, losing takes you 14<br />
Aware of MMR issues. We've been doing some work on the system but it isn't appropriate to roll it out mid season. (Source (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/416583868276551680))<br />

I wouldn't mind it at all. There are only two guilds in my Connected Realm group that are doing Heroic SoO (meaning they do a more casual normal SoO), and both are 10 man. My main and alt are done with Flex and have nothing to do raiding wise until WoD without committing to a regular raiding schedule with guilds that are somewhat behind.<br />

I would rather be able to do at least some (if not most or all) of normal SoO than nothing at all!</div></div><hr />

Flex didn't exist during those tiers. The difficulty jump between Flex and Normal isn't as huge compared to LFR and Normal. It would be possible for PuGs to complete a significant part of SoO if they selected people carefully. Larger realms already have some SoO PuGs.</div></div><hr />

This has been purely through pugs on Stormscale, a PvP oriented realm. On my lock I'm doing a weekly &quot;pug&quot; group where we progress through heroics and clear the rest normal, that's one night a week and we're currently 8/14 hc and planning to go 9/14 hc next week. My other characters just get a true /2 pug and gets full normal, sometimes with some heroics.<br />
<br />
How could premade groups via openraid possibly find SoO normal too hard then? When it's quite easily doable on a pvp-oriented realm. Back in cata I got my lifebinder in a weekly farm-group on openraid due to cross-realm hc's and I'd love to see that again. We choose who we want to play with so I can't see why the developers care if it can be hard, it still opens for the possibility of easier grouping than it is now.</div></div><hr />

I moved to a new (high pop) server yesterday, found a PUG in trade and we went 13/14 1 shotting nearly every boss with ease. <br />
<br />
I kill Flex 4 garrosh every single week in a cross realm group. I get that there may be technical issues to implement it but I do not at all see a reason it would need to be a wipe fest just because its a PUG.<br />
<br />
I create decent groups through oqueue all the time but the downside is we replace people along the way in Flex and that would be harder to do with a fixed raid lockout but that is still more of a technical problem more so than the quality of the people I run with that happen to be PUGing with me.<br />
<br />
Some people wouldn't wan't to miss some of the bosses because of lockout in cross realm groups but thats still better than being 14/14 flex every week and not being able to go into normal at all.<br />
<br />
It took a realm xfer but thankfully this is no longer an issue for me but I still feel for all the other people on med/low pop realms who can't find people to raid normal with.

He makes it sound like there's something inherently different about finding a random player from another realm compared to finding one from your own. How is potential failure worse than not being able to try in the first place? Even worse the conversation as a whole reads as if he doesn't understand the reasoning and is simply trying to brush the guy off. I don't buy for a single second that there's some massive technological hurdle in the way.</div></div><hr />

The new normals (WoD Heroics) are going to be cross-realm anyway, which makes me think it will be easier than SoO normals. I suspected this to be the case already because anything with flex scaling is going to be quite a bit easier with a full raid to encourage the social aspect and not kicking low performers. It ensures its doable at any group size with very conservative scaling, as amount of player damage added outscales boss hp scaling.</div></div><hr />

Don't do it.<br />
The constant nerfing of raids makes it feel less of an achievement when you clear it.<br />
By this stage, most guilds who haven't cleared it should have more than enough gear to outgear it. It's just a case of executing the fights correctly.<br />
You get to the stage where you can just skip entire phases/mechanics. That should be reserved for next expansions.<br />

Compared to the other pure DPS hunters damage isnt correct<br />
Yes your pets can bring missing buff but you will preff the class who have this buff because he will outdps any hunter.And since the flat nerf on your detterence CD we cant skip most of the deadly mechanics like before <br />
And that dude who says that MD is useless lets think again. MD is perfect tool for controling adds spawns and make sure that they will go stright to tanks instead to healers who start to run like chickens always oposite on tanks positions :)<br />
Also hunters are most casual one who have to deal with some side tasks like kill engeneer on garrosh or go on belt but they need a dps to do this task on heroic otherwise is better to send some mage or warlock to do their job :)<br />
<br />
And leaving SoO locked sux mine realm is empty and i want to do Normal pugs with mine alts or just Garrosh kill with mine main but i hope when 6.0 comes that to be changed and instance to be nerfed like other raids</div></div><hr />

And that is why i linked overall damage, not fight which favor one or another class. So what if there is 1 fight out of 14 where hunter shines?<br />
There are such fights for every class..<br />
<br />
Sorry, but hero/BL comes from mage or shammy.<br />
You miss BR in raidgroup? druid/lock/dk. We had 3 BR in 10man.. + the way how hunters battle ress works is retarded - why bother..<br />
I prefer revager/talstrider - just in case if someone is slacking with debuffs when there is much target switching.<br />
<br />
Pets &quot;can&quot; fill buff/debuff - BUT any serious group has them ALL! without our pets. <br />
If you talk about casual raiding, 5-6% damage does not matter as well!<br />
<br />
I am not talking about casual raiding with friends - hardcore raiding it the place where hunters suck! <br />
Sorry, but you can't compare hunters &quot;utility&quot; to paladin or priest.. You look stupid by doing that!<br />
<br />
I would gladly be 5-6% behind top dps classes if i could get all the utility/heals and raid cds as heal/dps hybrids does!<br />
But right now we are behind without ANY reason! same dps as hybrids(priest/druid/pala) without such utility/healing AND some raid cds!<br />
<br />
I am not mad, i quit serious raiding month ago! (after we downed Garrosh).<br />
But if you look at recent history: Mages, locks, rogues often gets stacked. While hunters are there only to soak agility mail. And not only because raid leaders hate hunters in general!<br />

If you min/max - sooner or later hunter will loose damage by doing such tasks. Sorry, but pet is buggy - even on passive/manual control. <br />
<br />
Skilled warlock(also pure) could gain dps in your examples - hunter could even loose some if pet bugs or something.<br />
Yes, it is safe with hunter - hard to fuck up.. But NOT most optimal scenario.. really skilled lock will gain dps in both examples.<br />
<br />
Same with target switching - we loose a lot because of pet. Leaving it on last target rarely is an option. + all the pet bugs.. <br />
Never seen new content without some pathing issues. <br />
---<br />
<br />
MD has huge potential, but blizzard rarely puts random adds in fights.<br />
Only fight where it was useful in MoP - tortos. Maybe i used it few times on horridon as well.<br />
<br />
Ranged taunt may come handy, but MD.. rarely.. not in hc raiding..<br />
---<br />
<br />
I didn't say that we have no toolkit (taunt,masters call, MD, even FD).. but there is no place to use them.. most fights are tank/spank + some shit on ground.<br />
<br />
Even if there were some fights where we could MD or taunt mob - our tools is NOTHING compared to priest/druid/paladin utility/healing/raid CD.<br />
It is only fair that we should do a little more dps to compensate for it.(instead we are getting benched tier after tier(while other pures even gets stacked)).<br />
<br />
I would be totally fine doing same dps as hybrids if only i had some raid cd etc.. to be fair!</div></div><hr />

It's hardly &quot;random.&quot; I picked Jug N and Malk N for a reason. And that reason is because they're Patchwerk bosses where the rankings are glaringly obvious. You just don't like it because it doesn't support your PoV. I'm sorry Hunter damage is over-reliant upon early burst from Stampede and falls off in longer duration Heroic encounters. But there are classes that will never even get the gear to outscale you with because their only damage specs are bad in Normals.</div></div><hr />

Hunters/retri paladins/shadow priests does about same dps.<br />
<br />
I would gladly take hand of protection/sacrifice/freedom/salvation.. all the defensive and healing talents + lay on hands.. <br />
instead of 8% ap buff (10% on top on 125%).. 5-6% overall damage.<br />
<br />
Same with priests - you don't realize what you have before you loose it.<br />
Hunters are pure dps class with ZERO raid utility/cd - we deserve those 5-6% dps on top of hybrids with raid CDs and offhealing.<br />
<br />
And don't start about hunter pet buffs - those are NOT raid utility/CD. Any serious raidgroup has every buff without our pets. <br />
Misdirection is useless(tanks NEVER loose agro).<br />
Ice traps remove other slows(we are not allowed to use them).<br />
Aspect of the daze is even worse - we have to sacrifice 20% of our damage.. Last and only time cheetah was useful in raiding - icc, hagara.<br />
<br />
Only reason why i stick to my hunter - i love it! <br />
I love shooting arrows. <br />
But from raid perspective - we could use a raid cd!<br />
<br />
We are pure dps with ZERO useful raid utility/CD. We get benched all the time, not stacked like other pure dps classes.<br />
Can't remember last time we were on top - we deserve it!<br />
<br />
From those dps charts, spriests are dead last on 3 of the fights if I remember correctly. And to be devils advocate here, what raid cd does a spriest have?<br />
<br />
- We have fort, which is unnecessary with a lock since they buff both stam/spellpower.<br />
- We have umm....Vampiric Embrace? Not entirely the bombshell of the century. Hymn of Hope? C'mon. <br />
<br />
People are not going to bring or not bring a spriest over a hunter due to that. You can fill any missing buff (fine, you're discounting this), you can use deterrence to absorb things at a much higher frequency than I can disperse to do the same thing.<br />
<br />
Grass is greener on the other side of the fence and all...movement means *zero* for you. That's hugely advantageous and you discount that.<br />
<br />
And you should know by now that &quot;pure dps&quot; being entitled to higher dps is a thing of the past. I remember being a mana battery in TBC and being a nothing in Vanilla. Hunter is the easiest dps class since you have less to worry about. Buff them too much and it's faceroll time since they're really easy to learn. I leveled up an alt and was shocked at the ease of it all...just run and shoot, bounce around like druids and shoot, instant burst, never a need for ramping up DPS...automated damage even if I decide to not push buttons. You don't have it as bad as you're making it sound.</div></div><hr />

It's called common sense. Zarhym has no idea either, he's just spouting off platitudes because he already knows the answer but is too weak to just say &quot;No, we we will not be doing that.&quot; so instead he threatens to delay all of WoD (which is pointless since we have no release date anyway) to get the person to stop bugging him about it.</div></div><hr />

WW Monks would like a word with you. <br />
<br />
We are a hybrid with guess what....zero raid CD's and off healing that's minuscule at best. Yet Hunters are brought over us due to ranged favored fights even if the hunter brings nothing but dps, be it less than the monk.<br />
<br />
<br />
Right now the fail rate for random SoO N groups would be too high. We open previous tiers when most outgear &amp; know strats.<br />
<br />
The fail rate for most FLEX SoO is f-ing high right now and that's cross realm, what's the difference with making normal that way then. I'm still going with they want people to blow cash to transfer. &gt;.&gt;</div></div><hr />

<br />
Obviously they wouldn't implement cross realm SoO as an LFR queue style, more like open-pug flex style. By that late in the tier, so much people would be decked out in normal / heroic gear that finding geared cross-realm pugs wouldn't be so much of an issue...<br />
<br />
If I can go on Open Raid and post &quot;LFM Flex SoO wing X, pst ilvl and achievement&quot;, then I can just do the same for normal...<br />
<br />
If it's a technical limitation then I can understand that.. but it works for t14 and t15 after the tiers ended, so why can't it work for current tier?</div></div><hr />

&quot;The fail rate would be too high&quot; is an absolutely ridiculous excuse. First off why is it okay that the fail rate in Warlords might be too high but not now? Why should that hold back the idea of me getting my friends who I know are competent raiders from other servers together because little Timmy might try and do an Openraid pug and wipe on immersius for 3 hours?<br />
<br />
Does this guy even remember that LFR exists? You want to talk about something with ridiculously high fail rates at times? Try LFR Garrosh. <br />
<br />
Absolute bullshit. Also love the subtle implication that they basically think a majority of their paying customers are terrible and thus would do nothing but wipe if they made it cross realm.<br />
<br />
Piss off Zarhym and take your terrible excuses with you.</div></div><hr />

Not surprising coming from a company that says when asked about why they don't just completely separate pvp and pve so nerfs and buffs won't affect the other that we're too stupid to be able to comprehend a spell doing two things depending on where we are.</div></div><hr />

How many pugs threw themselves like lambs to the slaughter at Oondasta? Pugs on my server virtually never killed him. It just resulted in a bad time for a whole lot of casual players. Blizzard had to nerf Oondasta into the dirt because they couldn't convince people that he was intended for experienced raiders. &quot;Release and run back!&quot; doesn't work in SoO.</div></div><hr />

You're right. They should also remove heroic mode since it causes a lot of wipes. :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

Normal and Heroic raids become cross realmable when the tier is over, Dragon Soul was after the mid tier patch. So it probably just takes a flip of the switch.<br />
<br />
And the &quot;you will fail too much&quot; is BS. If you could cross realm raids at any time people would also make cross realm guilds or use grouping sites like Openraid and it would be basically the same as playing with people on your same realm. IMO its harder to do the raids with a random group on your own realm because the talent pool is lower. Either that or you cant even try to do it because there arent enough people. I still think its a method to get people to pay them to realm transfer. Theres no other reason you shouldnt be able to do a raid with anyone in your region no matter what server they are on.</div></div><hr />

Why does everyone think every feature/art asset/piece of code just manifests itself out of thin air when game companies are creating games? That coding and modeling happens with the snap of a finger. They think the devs are just sitting around twiddling their thumbs and have time to do every idea we give them. They're all very busy working on things that they scheduled to work on RIGHT now. They can't put that all on hold to implement something that wasn't on the schedule. If you people want to make suggestions and requests, it has to be VERY early and you have to make it clear that it will be worth their time/money to implement (over other things.) If they DID go ahead and do that cross realm whatever it was, they're going to cut whatever else they were trying to work on from the game. Is that really worth it for the entire community? Thats the question they have to ask themselves when choosing what to make and what to cut.</div></div><hr />

You mean YOU don't need it. those people on dead servers who would like to get the mount but after 2 months of recruiting in trade and having 2 whispers in that time on a &quot;Medium&quot; population realm is just silly. With realms being beyond dead forcing you to pay to transfer just to get the mount is madness. Its like &quot;Lol we know servers are wank we will link them as slow as possible good luck getting a guild before WoD scrubs&quot;<br />

Who fucking cares? They took the time recently to make cross realm mailing for heirlooms. What did that mean for WoD? That we had to wait an extra week or two because of it? Oh noes!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mmoc2dccfd6bbe</div><div class="date">2014-01-08, 04:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">From those dps charts, spriests are dead last on 3 of the fights if I remember correctly. And to be devils advocate here, what raid cd does a spriest have?<br />
<br />
- We have fort, which is unnecessary with a lock since they buff both stam/spellpower.<br />
- We have umm....Vampiric Embrace? Not entirely the bombshell of the century. Hymn of Hope? C'mon. <br />
<br />
People are not going to bring or not bring a spriest over a hunter due to that. You can fill any missing buff (fine, you're discounting this), you can use deterrence to absorb things at a much higher frequency than I can disperse to do the same thing.<br />
<br />
Grass is greener on the other side of the fence and all...movement means *zero* for you. That's hugely advantageous and you discount that.<br />
<br />
And you should know by now that &quot;pure dps&quot; being entitled to higher dps is a thing of the past. I remember being a mana battery in TBC and being a nothing in Vanilla. Hunter is the easiest dps class since you have less to worry about. Buff them too much and it's faceroll time since they're really easy to learn. I leveled up an alt and was shocked at the ease of it all...just run and shoot, bounce around like druids and shoot, instant burst, never a need for ramping up DPS...automated damage even if I decide to not push buttons. You don't have it as bad as you're making it sound.<br />
<br />
you're kind of a silly shadow priest :D<br />
LOL?! Vampiric Embrace extremely often safed my raids ass when high dmg was incoming o.O<br />
even Hymn of Hope gives healer tons of mana.. so pls stop being silly and stop saying &quot;spriest have &quot;low&quot; support utilities!&quot;<br />
<br />
So if you say hunter dps is facerolling, then please prove me that statement. I play hunter for 4 1/2 year now and I can truly say that there wasnt ANY content where hunter was #1 dps class.. always blizzard overpowers hunter at the beginning of a content, straight ahead they nerf it till death (cuz everyone's crying especially pvp-player) and at the end of a content they buff him again.. i play on a heroic progressing guild and we finally killed blackfuse heroic yesterday.. we were just preferred for that fight because we can do any assambly line on our own.. not because we do dps by &quot;facerolling&quot; .. just watch all ranking logs on heroic content and then say hunter doesnt deserve any buff.. <br />
<br />
i think that buff was absolutely necessary .. its another try to balance classes dmg output (even if it wont be possible to get warlocks in case of dmg output)</div></div><hr />
