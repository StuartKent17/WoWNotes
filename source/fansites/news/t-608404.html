Worldwide Invitational 2008: Careers At Blizzard!<br />
Members of our staffing team will be present at the World Wide Invitational 2008. Don't miss your chance to discuss jobs at Blizzard and visit our recruitment booth!<br />
<br />
At Blizzard Entertainment Europe, you will work with some of the most creative and talented people in the industry, working together to create the best games in the world. If you share our goals, and have the skills, we want to hear from you! Blizzard Entertainment Europe was founded in 2003 and is a constantly growing company. With a current staff of more than 700 employees comprising 24 nationalities, you will work in a highly multicultural and dynamic environment.<br />

Kil'jaeden vs Loot FTW - Dragon controller PoV<br />
This is probably the last video of KJ we'll post, this one is from Loot FTW (http://www.lootftw.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=4311) and shows the dragon controller point of views for the first time. As you can see in the video this is a very important role during the encounter and it will probably interest some people to see how it's done. <br />

Season 4 &quot;2 weeks warning&quot;<br />
We don't provide release dates far in advance, this should come as no surprise really. We also feel that providing a 2 week warning is sufficient time for players to prepare for the end of the current season and the beginning of a new one.

BC Legendaries aren't getting an upgrade in WotLK<br />

New Wrath of the Lich King Wallpaper<br />
We just added a new fan wallpaper to our Wrath of the Lich King wallpapers section. This wallpaper features the fearful Lich King, grasping the hilt of Frostmourne, his icy gaze glaring out a challenge at the watcher.<br />

It will most likely NOT reappear.<br />
<br />
Because Tigole apperently don't think it's a good enough reason to do AQ40 at level 80, ZOMG NO EPIXXXXXXX in there.<br />
<br />
Would be awesome, but it's just not going to happend with this purplez community.</div></div><hr />

Atiesh lost its relevance once the people who had it moved past Kara.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In the light of the level 60 Legendaries at level 60, level 70 Legendaries are a joke.<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong, downing the bosses in question is hard (until you get them on farm), but the frequency and the ease of getting the legendaries are...</div></div><hr />

Think we had 8-10 splinters drop last weekend.</div></div><hr />

You say that's a fan wallpaper, but it's actually on the official Wrath site. There's just no link to it yet. If you click one of the existing wallpapers and change the number in the url to 10, that's what you get. There are a few more, too.</div></div><hr />

By reading the post on the wow site I don't think he means it will be out in 2 weeks. He's just saying they'll give a 2 week warning before comes out.</div></div><hr />
