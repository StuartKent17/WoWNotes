Vol'jins headhunters and hand of the Prophet are the Tanaan Jungle factions - Those probably relate to rep items for the WoD version of timewalking.<br />
<br />
The Allied Race notification is just a string for that. We know there will be more down the line but this isn't a sign of another one coming any time soon.</div></div><hr />

You're missing the point. He's complaining that the Horde horse has more effort/looks more high-res than the Alliance wolf. Which is in keeping with how it always has been - any time Horde gets a new mount, there's infinitely more time put into it than the Alliance get.</div></div><hr />

It's not like alliance wolf would be so bad... but if you don't like the tender design, switch to horde for spikes. I personally getting bored of &quot;Horde = spikes everywhere&quot; design principal, but at least they didn't overdone it with the horse in this case.</div></div><hr />

As if there are any more Alliance races looking good on horses. The only Alliance races that fit horses are humans, and possibly worgen. I have never played worgen so I might be wrong, but I don't think I have ever seen a worgen on a horse, even though it was added as their &quot;race&quot; mount later on.</div></div><hr />
