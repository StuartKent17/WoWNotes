New Lore: &quot;Charge of the Aspects&quot; Story Available<br />
The Cenarion Circle's victory in the Firelands offers Azeroth a brief reprieve. With the elemental armies of Deathwing the Destroyer broken and the Twilight's Hammer still reeling from its loss in the Bastion of Twilight, the tide has finally turned in favor of Azeroth's defenders.<br />
<br />
Emboldened by these triumphs, the Earthen Ring, the Cenarion Circle, and the remaining Dragon Aspects have completed the ritual to heal the World Tree Nordrassil. Now, the three groups shift their attention and energies toward using Nordrassil to mend their shattered world.<br />
<br />
Their efforts may well be in vain, however, for they will soon see that they cannot afford to waste any more time before they deal with the true threat to Azeroth: Deathwing.<br />

I have murdered one of my own.<br />
<br />
The thought hit Nozdormu the Timeless One the instant he saw the desiccated bronze dragon. Zirion had shriveled into a husk half his original size. Lesions covered his body from head to tail. Instead of blood, golden sand cascaded out of the wounds in unending streams upon which shimmered ghostly images of his life that had not yet come to pass. His future was bleeding out of him.<br />
<br />
Nozdormu strode across one of the isolated peaks of Mount Hyjal to stand by Zirion's side, every moment of history rippling over the Timeless One's sun-colored scales. As he loomed over the dying dragon, a wave of helplessness flooded through him. An impenetrable veil had descended on the timeways, one that not even he, the Aspect of the bronze dragonflight and the Guardian of Time, could pierce. The past and future—things he had once seen with clarity—had become muddled.<br />

^ This right here. I enjoyed it, but it felt way too much like a console game for my money. If I had to choose between paying for WoW or paying for SW:TOR, I'd go with WoW. Not to mention, the cut scenes are phenomenal, but I can only imagine how annoying they will get over time.</div></div><hr />

Lol to much like a console game... SWTOR is basically WoW wearing a Jedi robe constantly reading choose your own adventure novels... also WoW is going way downhill id say get out while the getting is good.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To each his own. I sincerely felt like I was playing the Star Wars baby pooped out by Dragon Age 2 and Mass Effect. It did not feel like an mmo to me (and yes, I have played other mmos aside from WoW). I'm not knocking all the cut scenes, they were extremely well done.. I just think that it's very time consuming, and that they will certainly get annoying with alts over time (for me). I'd love to play it, don't get me wrong, but as one of the many unemployed college students who play mmos - I have to make a choice. I think Star Wars will do well for a time, but the end game content will tell all. I'd rather wait and see if it ends up being like Rift, and in that case I would wait to get it until it is super cheap. <br />
<br />
Bioware has definitely done a good job from what I played on the beta,but it seems to be missing a lot of mmo staples. I really feel like the abilities don't make much sense as far as figuring a rotation goes. I also don't think you should be able to 2man heroics without a tank or healer on lower levels, I was a little disappointed with that. I'll stick around for MoP (as much as I dislike Pandaren), and hope that the end-game content has more to offer with Blizz starting to listen to feedback more. I am fully prepared to eat my words should SW:TOR be a huge success a year from now.</div></div><hr />

actually i would say about 60-70% may play again, i heard a lot of complaints and people saying since they actually tested the game out they were either not buying it or cancelling their pre-order. i was in beta and was in about 2-3 flashpoints where people were severely disappointed but gave it a chance to see how far and if it changed at higher levels which for me it didn't</div></div><hr />

I'm not too poor to play two mmos at once. But why waste money on a bad MMO (WOW) when I can spend it on a possibly good MMO (SWTOR, note I haven't played beta and haven't decided if I will get SWTOR)</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mmocc9639e0326</div><div class="date">2011-12-11, 10:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I watched a part of the video &quot;Race to World First&quot;. Could not identify with any of those feelings, it's the exact opposite for me. Raids, which I rarely do, bore me like no other thing. I don't get any adrenalin rush nor do I ever get a feeling of accomplishment. I mean you are fighting scripted events, evil world bosses who claim world dominance, yet they ALWAYS do the one thing they should NEVER EVER do: attacking the tank! Every modern game is proud of it's AI, yet in WoW artifical intelligence is UNWANTED! The bosses are programmed to act in the most stupid possible way. It's scripted, it's static, the raid improves over time, the bosses don't learn a damn thing. Raiding is about social commitment and learning raid mechanics by heart. The word skill shouldn't be mentioned in this context... ever. People like to think they are in a world full of evil threat that wants to wreck the world. Yet again, they deliberately choose to play on a PvE server, because there is that incredibliy low possibility of a real threat on a PvP server of being engaged by an enemy player AGAINST your will. How can this be? Evil is attacking me at a place and a time which I didn't want? This laughable little threat is already too much, and they evade to a PvE server. It'a also more than ridiculous when people ask for protection mechanisms on a PvP server. Protection should get less, not more! Yes you get ganked. Fine, this is a threat that is more real than any PvE encounter, as it's against your will and in most cases you can't do anything other than learning to deal with the situation. I know, unnacceptable for monster bashers. I respect players as a person if they enjoy PvE, if it's fun to them it's fine. But I definitely do not respect any of their PvE related in game achievements, as they are nothing... nothing, fighting scripted events with a non existant intelligence level. Basically, and now I use a language I normally don't use: get Gladiator or STFU. :-) (Meaning: defeating intelligent oponents and not dumb scripted events.) And don't get me wrong (as that is a common standard on any forums), this is all from an in-game perspective. Do not try to connect this to the real world with comments like &quot;as if being good in a stupid game matters anyway&quot;. Of course it's absolutely worthless if you connect any WoW achievement to the real world, they are worth nothing, but as said, this comparison was written from an in-game perspective.</div></div><hr />

Although the majority of the wow community would totally disagree with the viewpoints of those that interviewed in the documentary. Obsessing over a single video game for years and years on end is NOT a social norm. Spending 10 hours a day for 7 days a week is NOT healthy and should not be accepted by any parent/spouse. I do think these people need to take a step back and realise that, after all, WoW is not going to generate pension income for you and raise your family.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And because of Blizzard being Blizzard much of the content needs to be exploited just to even beat the bosses in the first weeks before they actually fix and appropriately balance the fight after rounds of nerfs to come as well.<br />
<br />
Just like back to heroic LK and even before then, people didn't beat it until % buffs.<br />
<br />
Top of the page post post I like, the AI in this game is STUPID, it needs to be more dynamic, adaptive, mobile and yes it can be done in WoW and it does not need to be a game like Vindictus(where the AI is much more complex) to have the same group concept. The scripting is quite obvious; get your hotkeys down, low latency, do not get bored/tunnel vision and memorize the fights and you got it beat.<br />
<br />
This level of AI was acceptable years ago, when we had smaller toolkits making it actually be more complicated as a payer and when we would expect Blizzard to only get better with AI design, because the game wasn't mature then.<br />
<br />
People who aren't in the &quot;race&quot; take this shit too seriously, why do they care what the top ones do or how, they will never have that equal life situation that allows them to play like these guys, regardless of what &quot;skill&quot; anybody tries to speak of. Not to downplay them or what they do, I support it but everybody on the outside needs to stop acting like what they care or don't care about those top guilds actually matters to them or everybody else.</div></div><hr />

I'm neither, I'm in the group of players who play the game to enjoy themselves, not to live vicariously through a bunch of self-important jackasses that are of a minuscule demographic that would have no problems with exploiting the hell out of boss encounters if they assume that the game developers would give them a 'free pass' because they've got thousands of 'fans' like you.<br />

I play wow and i didnt like the doco, it would of been better if they actually interviewed raid leaders from the top 10 guilds instead of focusing on 1 neck beard from Blood Legion, and it goes to show one person said they would do anything to be #1 *cough* paragon *cough*</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cronofan</div><div class="date">2011-12-11, 11:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A well made documentary. Although the majority of the wow community would totally disagree with the viewpoints of those that interviewed in the documentary. Obsessing over a single video game for years and years on end is NOT a social norm. Spending 10 hours a day for 7 days a week is NOT healthy and should not be accepted by any parent/spouse. I do think these people need to take a step back and realise that, after all, WoW is not going to generate pension income for you and raise your family.<br />
<br />
The documentary was interesting to say the least. Not sure how &quot;well made&quot; it was, a lot of glaring flaws, namely in almost every interview seeing the cord of the microphones run down people's shirts (personal pet peeve of mine), terrible framing in some cases or backgrounds that just detract from the interview. <br />
<br />
Technical issues aside, I love the idea of following a guild through their progression and seeing what their personal lives are really like. The only thing about this doc, as someone else has previously mentioned, is that you only get 1 guild. A series of documentaries interviewing a few guilds that would compare the styles of leadership/membership etc might be much more revealing, (although more time consuming and expensive) than a one off like this one. <br />
<br />
One thing that I think I have realised, when comparing these people to people in my own guild is simply the difference in dedication. On the whole, I don't believe that these people are really that much more &quot;skilled&quot; (skill within the context of raiding, whatever that means) than those in my guild or any other.Most guilds have a few exceptional players, some average and some lower, doesn't seem to be any different for them. If we were to play 30 hours a week each raiding, then we would probably be able to push content, and I think the same could be said for the large majority of guilds.<br />
<br />
Think about it, how many guilds eventually kill heroic mode bosses (not including post nerf)? A few thousand? Sure, they learn strats from videos that they've seen online but by this point there isn't much in the way of truly &quot;new mechanics&quot; (don't stand in the fire/aoe). Practicing what to do has a lot more to do with it than knowing what to do. <br />
<br />
Good work overall though.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Idletime</div><div class="date">2011-12-11, 11:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I liked the video, just validates that raiding at that level takes up all your time at any age. Hell, people I know that raid in bottom tier guilds eat up all their time doing this stuff and I myself used to be in that same boat trying to be Mr. Hardcore Raider and going after server firsts until I realized something - it's a tremendous waste of time. Friends of mine and even family would stop inviting me to things because they knew I had to go kill dragons and they didn't want to intrude because normally the answer would be &quot;I'm tied up and can't break away&quot;. I came away from that video a little sad, all these people are deluded. In reality Ararat's uncle had it correct, he was the adult in the room here. When you're obligated to be somewhere 20+ hours a week, we call this a part time job. Don't put down that you're leading raids or World First in video games on a resume, it'll find the file 13 fast. The working world looks at these things as tremendous wastes of time. You are in a severe minority that is outside the norm. Ask my old boss, he used to make fun of me in meetings in front of everyone after a coworker told him that's how I spent my free time and I was in a server leading guild at the time. Comments like, &quot;For those of you not raiding tonight, put together a report for me on your territory, everyone else should probably review their goals&quot; come to mind. Yeah, my raiding &quot;career&quot; ended. The girl from Paragon saying, &quot;This is the future&quot; and turning 23 on a raid night is simply sad. It's not the future, unless you believe sloth is an enviable attribute. Today's MMOers are yesterday's D&amp;Ders and LARPers, just in pixelated form. Not that I care how people spend their time, but don't tell me that this is anything to be admired. Transfer your passions to something more productive. ffs</div></div><hr />

<br />
Having people you never seen or heard of knowing your name, that is fame. most of them are not saying that they are what you think of as famous, but they are saying that when there are people out there that respect you and regonize you (their ingame character in this film), what you do is something you can be proud of, youve done something that others dream of, and thats something to be proud of if you ask me.<br />
<br />
But what i like about films like this is getting to see how people like this think and act, its not that you have to envy people like this to enjoy the film, because i see films like this about drug addicts, people growing up in areas with war and so on. its not too see people that are better than you, its just to see people that are diffrent, and trying to understand whats going on in their head.<br />
<br />
Last thing, people that say that they want to see &quot;serious raiders&quot; instead of a guild that is &quot;only&quot; number 10, first of, its more interresting with a guild like this, instead of just seeing paragon going, we are number one, and we will probaly be it again. also unless you are in one of the guilds that are above them, you cant really judge their skills, and if you are and still do it, your just a giant douche.</div></div><hr />

Ive been in Swtor beta for 2 months and what i like about it, it brings a vanilla/tbc feeling.<br />
Alot of stuff is new but just leveling to 50 does req u to group alot more than wow to 85.<br />
Some of the flashpoints at higher lvl req skill to get past, skill thats completely unseen in wow unless ur in a heroic raid encounter (think tbc heroic dungeons pre-nerf)<br />
The sheer difficulty of some of the stuff in this game is prob what draws my attention. Add to that the catering to casual qq in wow.<br />
Im a true beleiver of if u want something u have to earn it, sadly if swtor gets to big itll prob drag shit tons of baddies to it who demands to get all lewt by clicking 1 button.</div></div><hr />

Could not identify with any of those feelings, it's the exact opposite for me. Raids, which I rarely do, bore me like no other thing. I don't get any adrenalin rush nor do I ever get a feeling of accomplishment. I mean you are fighting scripted events, evil world bosses who claim world dominance, yet they ALWAYS do the one thing they should NEVER EVER do: attacking the tank! Every modern game is proud of it's AI, yet in WoW artifical intelligence is UNWANTED! The bosses are programmed to act in the most stupid possible way. It's scripted, it's static, the raid improves over time, the bosses don't learn a damn thing. Raiding is about social commitment and learning raid mechanics by heart. The word skill shouldn't be mentioned in this context... ever. People like to think they are in a world full of evil threat that wants to wreck the world. Yet again, they deliberately choose to play on a PvE server, because there is that incredibliy low possibility of a real threat on a PvP server of being engaged by an enemy player AGAINST your will. How can this be? Evil is attacking me at a place and a time which I didn't want? This laughable little threat is already too much, and they evade to a PvE server. It'a also more than ridiculous when people ask for protection mechanisms on a PvP server. Protection should get less, not more! Yes you get ganked. Fine, this is a threat that is more real than any PvE encounter, as it's against your will and in most cases you can't do anything other than learning to deal with the situation. I know, unnacceptable for monster bashers. I respect players as a person if they enjoy PvE, if it's fun to them it's fine. But I definitely do not respect any of their PvE related in game achievements, as they are nothing... nothing, fighting scripted events with a non existant intelligence level. Basically, and now I use a language I normally don't use: get Gladiator or STFU. :-) (Meaning: defeating intelligent oponents and not dumb scripted events.) And don't get me wrong (as that is a common standard on any forums), this is all from an in-game perspective. Do not try to connect this to the real world with comments like &quot;as if being good in a stupid game matters anyway&quot;. Of course it's absolutely worthless if you connect any WoW achievement to the real world, they are worth nothing, but as said, this comparison was written from an in-game perspective.<br />
<br />
<br />
They get excited because they have to work really hard for it. It's also because they accomplished it as a team.<br />
<br />
Maybe you never got that excited because you didn't have to try hard and didn't go for world first kills.<br />

I had my share of the real hardcore raiding (read: top50 in vanilla), then I kinda got burnt out by it, but yet this does make me feel the old days of being at the high level of raiding and that rush which you get from getting even a server first, or even a particularily difficult boss (i.e Ragnaros v.4.2) is something that I don't get from any other game or movie. What I find sad is the prejudice of people seem to be that you have absolutely no other life than WoW if you're in the hardcore high-end guilds of today, or that every hardcore raider fits the same slot of &quot;no-good-unemployed-living-at-their-mothers-basement-fat-nolife&quot;. It's not like that, and that does show in the documentary if you would just look at it in more depth rather than the prejudice-filled superficial outer shell of it which seems to be the thing most people see when watching this.<br />
<br />
You can't judge anyone before you actually know them in real life, making calls based on what you saw in a 1-hour documentary is something you should be judged for. Some people play the game for fun (making gold through the AH etc.), some people play the game casually i.e for achievements, some people raid casually, and some people raid at the hardcore level. Just because someone plays WoW doesn't make them any less worthy as a person. Last I've seen prejudices like these being thrown around was with CS, and look at the FPS scene of the modern day now; multiple money-making FPS games with multiple sequels, yet nobody calls someone playing MW2 or MW3, or whatever the current &quot;hot&quot; FPS game is, &quot;professionally&quot; as a no-life.<br />
<br />
Let's take up South Korea as an example; gaming houses, gaming teams, people playing 10+ hours a day and getting paid for it, they are adored by the whole nation if they're succesful, hell, even some politicians there follow the gaming scene and have their personal favorites. South Korea has its own tv-channel dedicated to nothing but gaming. There every major tournament is held in an arena with famous (at least in Korea) performing acts on the stage during the opening ceremonies. There all this is considered normal, as their national &quot;sport&quot; if you will, in the rest of the world this is considered unhealthy. But who are we to judge? If it works for them, it works for them, big deal. You still have your own life and you can do whatever you want with it, the fact that people play video games for the sake of being the best in the world at it, doesn't change that fact one bit, nor should it.<br />
<br />
The documentary points out the investments people make for that certain period of time where the race for world first is going, and as you can see, there are many differences there. Some play 20 hours a day (russians in the doc) some play 5 hours for 5 days a week (Blood Legion), the approach is different, yet the goal for both is same, to be there, at the top, and be recognized by the WoW community. Let's throw a slightly prejudiced example here; If you had a chance to be known by 12 million people in the world instead of just your friends and family, and most likely never achieving something that would be known as widely, would you, if you had the time and the willpower to commit yourself to it, make the effort of racing for the world first? At least I would, but I don't have the time for it, so I won't be able to be at the very top. That's just the way it is, and will be, until I find the time required somewhere. Even your regular hobbies, such as hockey, soccer or football require time, and the better you get, the more time it will consume from your life if you urge to be the best.<br />
<br />
People also mention that it requires no skill to be the best in the world. Do explain how they still manage to be at the top on every new tier, is it just luck? Of course they spend more time on an encounter than an average raider, they may even spend the hours of an average raiders week in a single day, that alone doesn't mean that they will be the first (as you can clearly see in the documentary with the russian guild speding 20 hours per day). There's both skill and luck involved; let's talk about the current content, heroic Ragnaros, the gear in which Paragon managed to pull off the kill was mostly still from the previous tier, Method even thought the encounter to be impossible without nerfs to make it to phase 4 with only 2 meteors. Yet Paragon somehow managed to pull this off. They had the skill to pull off that which was yet again thought to be unkillable. Stars did the same with Yogg-0 pre-nerfs. Albeit it was a strategy based on RNG, it worked. You can't pull off kills like that with just time investments, you need to have a certain skillset to go with it. Not to mention all the brainstorming that goes on between every wipe during progress races, it requires skill even to be able to figure out a working strategy on the go. By your logic of &quot;it doesn't require skill, only time&quot;, most guilds would already be 4/8 in DS by now. Someone mentioned the FL progress which exploded after the nerfs to every boss, the people lacked the skill to beat the bosses pre-nerf, period. Bosses get easier over time because our gear improves, you can have players in full 7/8 HC BiS gear, yet they still won't kill heroic Ragnaros without the skill that the encounter requires from every player.<br />
<br />
The best are the best for a reason, they invest time into practicing and theorycrafting to get the best possible outcome for their raids, and that is something many &quot;general&quot; raiding guilds won't commit to. There may be those few people in every guild that pull their full weight by getting the most out of their character, but if the rest aren't willing to commit as much, they will never get to the top, and that's a cold, hard fact.</div></div><hr />

I know it's competitive and all, but it really is a game at the end of the day. At ultimately their 'achievements' are only recognised by a small handful of people who look at a ranking website and go 'oh cool'. And considering what happened this tier with the LFR exploits, no-one really respects world first raiders anymore. And after seeing the balls to the wall commitment they put into 'competing' I think I've lost even more respect for these guys.</div></div><hr />

Like hooligans taking a sport way too seriously and start killing eachother over it. Or people who play in the NBA making millions or billions of dollars. That's just sad.<br />
<br />
I call having 10.000 fans on facebook and maybe millions of people watching your videos fame. Getting invited by a huge game developer to play on a stage is also pretty impressive.<br />
<br />
I bolded the two points that made me lol the most. <br />
<br />
For the first one, you are honestly comparing Football, an old sport that has been around for a long time regardless of its format, to a bunch of sweaty fat nerds getting boners about killing a static encounter in a video game before anyone else? Seriously? Want to rethink that stance?<br />
<br />
The second one, these aren't fans. They aren't. World of Warcraft is not like other sports. It isn't even A sport. It won't have a chance to evolve over time, or become something new from the old, it will just die. It will end, and people will find a new game that they want to show off in, and act like they are important. It is a vicarious cycle, and one that is absolutely hilarious. People take video games too seriously, and defending it as a sport is proof positive.<br />
<br />
I'll bite however and say I agree it is ridiculous people riot, scream, and kill each other over real sports, but the fact of the matter is, these are events that have been around for years and years and are TANGIBLE. People will do stupid things, after all, people threaten and bitch on these forums all the time about their respective e-heroes. The only difference is, they either can't physically act upon these desires, or are too afraid to do so. If they are not going to do the foolish things they preach to the detractors of their e-heroes, then they should be silent.<br />
<br />
EDIT for Win: It has been over fifty years since Babe Ruth entered the Hall of Fame, regardless of how he did it, he is still remembered. He is still remembered, and will be for a very long time. Hell, I don't even WATCH Baseball, and I know who Babe Ruth is.<br />
<br />
Do you think people will remember these sweaty nerds for their &quot;accomplishments&quot; in just a few years from now? No, they won't. A new game will arise soon enough, and that will be the new vicarious circle jerk that their &quot;fans&quot; feed off of like vampires, while their e-heroes do the same to the shimmering, fleeting feeling of fame.</div></div><hr />

<br />
How the hell do you White Knight something like an opinion, it is virtually impossible. White Knighting the guilds themselves? Okay, but you can't White Knight the ideology that these e-heroes and &quot;e-sports&quot; are something we don't need documentaries on. That is called a damn opinion. No one in a few years will remember what the hell an onyxia was and who killed it first. This is why it is an opinion, and a damn good one at that.<br />
<br />
As for myself, I'm not bashing what these people do with their time. If they want to play video games like they were life and death for the rest of their lives while slurping down meager sponsorships, go the hell ahead. It is their life. What I am arguing for, is this as a sport.<br />
<br />
It just isn't, and there is too much evidence to prove it.</div></div><hr />

Are you kidding? Did you even watch the documentary? You don't have to be a professional to see that some of those people have major issues. Not saying that WoW is the cause, but I'm pretty sure spending so much time playing a video game isn't helping either.</div></div><hr />

Pretty valid point that guy in the video made when he said gaming might get accepted in the future, and you might get discriminated if you play sports.

<br />
You are missing the point entirely and thinking only in a subjective manner.<br />
<br />
The object of my post was to say that sports in the tangible world have far, FAR more history and individuals who's names are solidified in history itself. It doesn't matter what YOU as an individual think, because the fact of the matter is, the majority of people can name sports heroes without even knowing who they really are. Can people do the same for Warcraft heroes? Or Starcraft? No. It is minorities like yourself who can.<br />
<br />
Again I repeat myself, these games will die out in the next 10 years at the most, their popularity dwindled and absorbed into the next great MMO. Meanwhile, real sports and those who accomplished feats in them will still be remembered regardless.<br />
<br />
This isn't some opinion of mine, this is fact, and has been repeated in the past. I don't spout this because I feel this way, I say this because the past has shown us this is what happens. To deny that, is idiocy.<br />
<br />
CAN video gaming reach a sport? Maybe so, WILL it? Not with games like World of Warcraft. It has a much better chance of doing so with distinct genres like shooters and fighting games, than it does an MMO.<br />
<br />
That said, if you want an actual opinion, I personally think sports in general are a foolish thing. People throwing each other at one another or kicking balls or even, in this day and age, clicking a controllerfor the enjoyment of others, while you yourself could be the real professional, and not some guy in the stands, I think is ridiculous. However, my opinion does not change facts.</div></div><hr />

You have to be kidding. Soccer or baseball being a sport or more of a sport than raiding in WoW is not an opinion, it's a fact. If you don't think they're sports I'd really have to question your grip on reality and/or general intelligence. The same goes if you are trying to compare killing scripted monsters on your computer to actually playing a real sport. Raiding is not a sport in any way whatsoever. You can make a competition out of anything, but not every competition is a sport.<br />
<br />
Sport: an athletic activity requiring skill or physical prowess and often of a competitive nature, as racing, baseball, tennis, golf, bowling, wrestling, boxing, hunting, fishing, etc. <br />
<br />
Raiding does not require skill or physical prowess now does it? Well, unless you consider having a memory a skill and sitting on your ass an athletic activity it doesn't. Now if you want to call high level arena a sport I might not fully agree with it but it at least has an argument. Raiding does not.</div></div><hr />

Pretty much...its ironic that only like 1 person from the video still actually raids. The truth is that being in a top guild is pretty awesome but no one can keep it up forever. I was in BL myself for 2+ years and it was definitely the best time I had in WoW. But looking at their member list now there's only like 3 names I still recognize from BC. For everyone there comes a point where you can't keep up with the hours anymore and you realize its time to move on. But I definitely don't regret all the time I spent raiding cause it was a lot of fun. I think everyone who's been in a top guild will say the same as long as they didn't go to extremes to make WoW a priority over their real life.</div></div><hr />

EDIT for Win: It has been over fifty years since Babe Ruth entered the Hall of Fame, regardless of how he did it, he is still remembered. He is still remembered, and will be for a very long time. Hell, I don't even WATCH Baseball, and I know who Babe Ruth is.<br />
<br />
Do you think people will remember these sweaty nerds for their &quot;accomplishments&quot; in just a few years from now? No, they won't. A new game will arise soon enough, and that will be the new vicarious circle jerk that their &quot;fans&quot; feed off of like vampires, while their e-heroes do the same to the shimmering, fleeting feeling of fame.<br />
<br />
The gaming industry is the biggest entertainment industry in the world. Just see all the new there beginning playing games on facebook and so on. Its become much more normal and many of our children will grow up with computer games.<br />
There have been several scrutiny, that say kids there play computer games are more creative. But there is no doubt playing 5 hour each day is healthy.<br />
There are many people using alot of freetime playing golf (could be Dart, bowling, pool, chest and you name it) and its not like its more a sport then gaming is. Think about is, there are no more boring thing to see in the TV then foodball, true it can be funny to play, but alle the people thinking they are so sporty sitting in there chair watching TV and allways nerd talking about it in the public, its no like you are better people.<br />
With all that stupid reality and other crap tv now days. Its not strange many more like to sit a the computer chatting and playing games instead.<br />
Computer games are the future and many of the real big player will be remembered by other gamers and it will become much more normal.<br />
True some day people dont play wow, but then there are another game.</div></div><hr />

Many hardcore players playing all that time they say in the video in 2-3 weeks and then all is cleared and then it will only take 1 day each week (2-3hours) to clear in the future. Many other guilds raiding 4 hour 3 days in the week in 6 month, so who are &quot;wasting&quot; most time if you think about it :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
To give some brief examples:<br />
If i run down 200m the street to get my bus, it is definetly no sport!<br />
But if i would run 200m in a stadion against some other ppl, it suddenly is called sport!<br />
And if i am so good at it, that some ppl would even pay money to see me running, i would be called a professional and could earn my living with it... strange isnt it?<br />
Still i am just running.<br />
<br />
Back in the days, football was just a game someone came up with, and was played just for fun. And im damn sure some ignorant ppl back then also said, that football is just a waste of time and no one will ever care if u are good at it or not, just like you are trying to argue that esport will never be considered a sport.<br />
<br />
And im sure if speed eating would fascinate enough ppl, which would be willing to pay in order to see it, it would be considered a sport too, with professionals and leagues and so on.<br />
<br />
Even if u like it or not, it is quite possible that someday, esport, in what ever shape or form, will be considered a real sport.<br />
<br />
So my point is, its not the things we do per se, its the recognition we get for it, is what defines a sport.<br />
<br />

If you wipe 100 times on a really hard boss per day, that's more trial and error that 90% of the guilds who raid 3 times a week gather in 2-4 weeks. There's of course a skill difference between players, nobodies denying that, but there is a lot and I mean a lot top players in guilds that are on 5k+ positions on wow progress or higher. It's a personal decision if you want to invest heavily into it, or if you just want to cruise and take it as a hobby.</div></div><hr />

i have watched it. again. it's their leisure time and it's their choice to be committed to a video game. why are you so concerned? why do you make such radical assumptions that they have nothing else going in their life other than this game? apparently watching a documentary that takes a look into people's lives at a certain time period makes you all knowledgeable. if this is the thought process then I can assume the people with high post counts on this forum do nothing else. but that would be ignorant of me, wouldn't it?<br />

How the hell do you White Knight something like an opinion, it is virtually impossible. White Knighting the guilds themselves? Okay, but you can't White Knight the ideology that these e-heroes and &quot;e-sports&quot; are something we don't need documentaries on. That is called a damn opinion. No one in a few years will remember what the hell an onyxia was and who killed it first. This is why it is an opinion, and a damn good one at that.<br />
<br />
As for myself, I'm not bashing what these people do with their time. If they want to play video games like they were life and death for the rest of their lives while slurping down meager sponsorships, go the hell ahead. It is their life. What I am arguing for, is this as a sport.<br />
<br />
It just isn't, and there is too much evidence to prove it.<br />
yes it would appear i derped and used the term white knight in the wrong place.<br />
<br />
regardless, who said anything about going down in history and being remembered? if people find joy in being the first people to down heroic bosses in WoW, and are passionate about it, then why does that bother you so much? people have different interests and passions. if a group of passionate gamers want to form a community such as &quot;e-sports&quot; and have a professional level to it, then more power to them.</div></div><hr />

And you still don't agree that some of those people could benefit from a little therapy? It's not about how much they play (in my opinion) it's about having a healthy relationship with the game. Which some of them clearly don't. There's a difference between playing for fun, and severe addiction. If WoW is your #1 priority in life, something is wrong. Really.<br />

I'll agree to the point that someone stated before as to a sport being something that is enjoyed, and evolved over time, but WoW just can and will not ever be a sport. It is nothing but friendly competition taken to a new level and prettied up to be a sport. It doesn't bother me per se, its just more of a peeve to see people calling it a sport, when it is more akin to a high school clique. It is popular to like these people, who will be forgotten by the majority in a few years when this game dies down.<br />
<br />
That said, I do agree with you that gaming has a chance to become a sport, but it is more likely to happen with shooters and fighting games than MMO's, as they are a distinct genre that hardly ever changes with leaps and bounds, as well as with the turn of popularity, like MMO's do.<br />
<br />
I stand by what I said though, in a few years the majority will not remember who these people are, and they will be forgotten. They will be nothing but the popular clique WoW once held onto, before it lost its sheen and popularity. That is why it is ludicrous to consider world firsts a sport, it is nothing more than friendly competition.<br />
<br />
To add some flavor to my post, do I agree gaming should be a sport? No. Sports are something you exert yourself physically for, and something you need to push your body to accomplish something. Something that is more than clicking a few buttons to achieve teamwork, as someone else said earlier in the thread. This whole hype with e-sports is something recent and perhaps I presume too much with this next statement, but many people have lived through the golden age of gaming. They have seen the Atari, seen Pong, and seen the humble age of gaming, where it was merely a few friends in their basement watching pixels bounce up and down and seeing who can get the high score.<br />
<br />
To see it go from friendly childhood competition, to something as, in my opinion, foul as this is just... Wrong. Gaming went from something that was like a past-time to many people, to a bunch people having ego-trips at being good at clicking a few buttons on a controller/keyboard. It is sad to see.<br />
<br />
Do I have the right to dictate what is and isn't a sport though? No. That is up to the people and to the annals of time themselves, and while I do feel strongly about MMO's not being sport worthy, I do admit that shooters and fighting games do have the potential that MMO's do not, so we shall see.</div></div><hr />

the funny thing about perspectives and opinions, they differ. i saw a bunch of people being passionate and having fun competing with each other in a video game, to an &quot;extreme&quot; and &quot;hardcore&quot; extent. you apparently saw a bunch of people with a severe addiction to a video game that should seek psychological help.<br />

You're right, is it a grim twenty minutes &quot;won't get back&quot;. Do you know why? Because while I, and a few other individuals gave our reasonings as to why this is not a sport, and enjoy casual discussion to reach a middle-point, or simply realize that such a thing will not be acquired in this debate, people like yourself simply waltz in here to say &quot;LOL HATERS GUNNA HATE&quot; and walk out, as if you made some stunning difference in the lives of millions, and successfully defended your e-idols.<br />

I since see someone else say it lol so id like to go back to that original statement. :D If people are happy doing this type of thing thats fine good luck to them, but they shouldn't be under the assumption that anyone else would care about it for more than 2minutes. I've played wow for 4-5 years in the same guild since the beginning, we're pretty semi-casual but we still see most of the content while it's still relevant. If my guild ever crumbles for some reason I'll be quitting wow, because the only reason I play it over any other of the mmos out there is the friends I've made within it. We have all kinds of people from all kinds of jobs and some have restrictions of when they can raid. I would rather raid with these people for the 4 days a week they can and enjoy their company than be in a slightly better guild. Who cares if u kill say 8/8 bosses the first day if that was possible. What would you do for the rest of the expansion? This is the last content we're getting until pandaria unless they release some kind of tiny ruby sanctum scenario. <br />
<br />
I like to log on every day and talk to my friends, I can only imagine after the world race is done there is nothing for those people to do and log in for, for months. If u have a 6month period in which to kill bosses, I honestly see no difference between a guild that kills them the first day and a guild that kills them 5months down the line. People seem to worship the first guild but who's to say anyone else couldn't do that? You have to sacrifice a lot of time and thats it tbh, maybe slightly harder to be first over the 10 or so guilds that are competiting but to be in the 10? Unless you are mentally retarded it is a game and anyone can do it, just put your life on hold. But whats the accolade you get?<br />
<br />
I've played wow 4-5 years and thanks to mmo champ I've seen some of the guild names in passing, I know paragon and method are top guilds, I honestly didn't know they were EU guilds till last week though, and I couldn't tell you which tier they finished first in. You know what I will remember forever about wow? The awesome late night Kara runs when I was a noob being accepted into a group of fantastic people, the humbling feeling of them taking a chance on me in black temple and being there for the first kills of mother and council. The 24 rogues that we went through in wrath, they all had a weird curse on them. One got attacked by an iphone, one went to jail, one ran over his sister. (all the excuses we got) All the ninja pulls by pets and totems that were only mildly frustrating because we werent going for firsts, that we laugh about every day. If you play Halo co-op with your mate, you remember the funny things you did playing the game together, you don't remember the name of the guy on the leaderboards.</div></div><hr />

It's not like fatal1ty was to Quake3 or the top flight SC teams - he/they are the equivalent of the best sports teams in the world.

<br />
You're wrong. I've been in as deep as some of them and I have not touched WoW in over a year. Not because of some kind of therapy, or that I decided that the game was bad for me or anything like that, just because I didn't find the game enjoyable anymore. And I'm far from the only one. <br />
<br />
What you're seeing is people that are enjoying a game in a completely different way than most people enjoy it. They are not addicted in any way, as they're not struggling with wanting to quit but having a hard time doing it. People just doing something they enjoy (even if it seems extreme and unhealthy) are not addicted, they just enjoy it so much that they have made a choice that it's worth the sacrifices. It's like going out on Friday even though you know you're gonna have a hangover on Saturday. It doesn't make you an alcoholic.<br />
<br />
If anything, you could call them misguided. Prioritizing WoW over career or relationships or whatever probably seems wrong for most people, but at the same time these people probably get as much or more satisfaction out of WoW than they have ever gotten chasing either of those things. Some of them basically say straight out that they don't enjoy their career choice. You could argue that they should find a job they like, but it's not like it's something new for people to stay in a deadbeat job and rather focus on enjoying their hobby.</div></div><hr />

Unless they've changed it within the past two weeks, you had to send one of your companions away to do the crafting/gathering for you. That can be nifty, since you can gather materials while out questing, except that they're gone for minutes at a time. I remember working (as an artificer) on a purple might hilt 2 and it requiring 5 minutes to craft. The base items were sitting at 1 minute to craft apiece, and yes, you can queue up to five projects, but that seems excessive.</div></div><hr />

But a lot of those guys in Blood Legion just seem way to full of themselves. Personally I could relate a lot more to &quot;The Raid&quot; and the people presented in that movie and the presentation and background of gamers was much better IMO. I know this is about world first and &quot;The Raid&quot; was not. But who is Blood Legion anyway? Paragon.. now those we know about. :)</div></div><hr />

Many top 50 guilds could probably put togheter a competetive roster for a race to first if they merged with another hungry guild. However being able to keep that competetive edge for months at a time is where most would fail. <br />
<br />
The biggest challange is definately finding enough people willing and able to put in the effort. Individual skill, while important is not that big of a factor. Meaning you don't have to have awesome hand/eye coordination and super fast twitch reflexes and what not. After a certain point most players in the top 50 have a similar amount of knowledge of mechanics, theory crafting and so on. Everyone in top 50 probably has min/maxed every bit of gear and near-perfected their rotations and know when to move from the fire. <br />
<br />
The biggest &quot;heroes&quot; to me are the organisers. The people who try to get all of those people to log in, play hard for 8 hours and maintain focus and keep reqruiting new blood. <br />
<br />
While the top guilds work the hardest it should also be noted that they get the choicest of all new applicants so they have an easier time maintaining a competetive roster of players which further helps them win the race.<br />
<br />
Sure, we've seen top 20 guilds play a perfect game and snag a world first on occasion but after that they simply cannot keep up the pressure. <br />
<br />
I've personally been in high rated guilds and played with many e-famous WoW people so i have atleast some idea what i'm talking about.</div></div><hr />

Paragon didn't exist before wrath and was a merger of like 5 guilds. They left over 50+ people in the dust just to beat bosses.</div></div><hr />

Checked &quot;Rickolus&quot; but couldn't find anything that sounded the same as that.. :(<br />

<br />
Sorry for replying so late, I just made an account to answer your question since I too, have been looking for this song.<br />
I finally found it by just buying the soundtrack to the entire documentary.<br />
The song you're referring to is called Beethoven's 5th Piano Concerto. I have an mp3 file of it if you'd like to have it.<br />
<br />
Also, for the person requesting the outro song, I have that too since it came with the soundtrack so just send me a<br />
message if you'd like to know how to get them.<br />

Yes, the DVD has 9 Bonus interviews with the top players and a 5 minute deleted scene that features Absalom, Blood Legion's main tank in Toronto.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sabbotage</div><div class="date">2011-12-14, 02:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">someone said something about quake players and gaming...<br />
<br />
You mean like: Thresh, Reptile, Fatal1ty?<br />
<br />
Yea......those ppl actually got real money to play all day and do that for years. I was at Quakecon when Fatal1ty won 250k at 16 years old and by the end of the year had won more than 1mill in sponsor money and tourney money to do nothing but travel around and play Quake all day every day......which would make it worth while so you could like.........pay ur rent? feed ur family/self? move out of the basement? get ur own place? buy a car? i dunno, seems reasonable to me. As far as i know tho these guilds arent getting that kinda money to be world first. And even if they were, theyd be splitting that cash 25 ways....which really wouldnt make it too much worth while since new content only comes out once every 6 months or so? Dont get me wrong tho, i got mad respect for what these ppl do, raiding as much as they do and actually downing it so fast and getting 25 ppl to work as a single unit is very impressive. Not knocking anything they do as they definately are very skilled ppl and know how to work together, but in the end when there is no real money involved, i cant see that as anything i personally would be doing that hard and long of a grind just to have &quot;fame&quot; and be &quot;known&quot;.......show me the money</div></div><hr />

The more that it got in to the guilds, Blood Legion, etc,., the more I felt the people were... Well, not people at all. Progression is a main stay of the game, but the people in the film were pretentious at best, here is to looking at you, Blood Legion.</div></div><hr />
