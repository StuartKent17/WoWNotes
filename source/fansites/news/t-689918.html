PvP Resilience Changes<br />
We are currently in the process of applying a hotfix to buff resilience. While some modifications may be made, we intend to have this buff in effect for the remainder of the Wrath of the Lich King expansion.<br />
<br />
The change will double the value of resilience in reducing damage done by players. So depending on their current amount of resilience, characters might experience a 10 to 20% decrease in damage taken from other players. The critical strike chance and critical strike damage reduction components of resilience will remain unaffected by this change.<br />
<br />
We are also aware of the possibility that this change will make healing in PvP too difficult to counter. While we are not making any immediate changes to address this issue, we have prepared some further changes that will allow us to quickly deploy a PvP-only healing adjustment if we feel it is warranted.<br />
<br />
We will be applying this change very soon while we are between Arena seasons so we can evaluate how it works in multiple PvP scenarios for the upcoming Arena season, and as we continue to prepare for Cataclysm. As we have mentioned previously, one of the goals for Cataclysm is to have a PvP environment where it is harder to regularly achieve so much damage and healing in relatively few global cooldowns compared to what we currently have in the game. <br />
<br />
Blue posts<br />
Resilience damage reduction doubled<br />
We think crits need to be proportionately weaker in PvP than in PvP. I'll explain why in a minute, but first let me reiterate that the buff we are making to resilience just affects damage. The relative value of crit in PvP won't change at all with this hotfix. You won't be critting less or doing less proportional damage when you crit. If you hit now for 3000 and crit 30% of the time for 6000 then after this change you might hit for 2700 and crit 30% of the time for 5400. Crit damage will be lower, but crit damage relative to normal damage will not. We don't want to get to the point where a crit is actually mitigated lower than an actual hit. That would be bizarre and do bad things for a lot of talent trees.<br />
<br />
As to why we think resilience needs to reduce crits, it's because you're playing against another human and not an AI-controlled creature. Creatures generally don't heal or blow defensive cooldowns, or at least not very well. The ability to pack a lot of damage into a small time window is much more important in PvP just because the opposing player or team have so much control over the size of that window. If you whittle them down to 10% of their health but can't &quot;close the deal&quot; then they may be back up at 50% or 100% in no time. This kind of mechanic happens in PvE too, but much more rarely. The ability to crit in PvE is important largely because it buffs your damage or keys into talents. But the burst portion of crits themselves (high damage in a short amount of time) is much more important in PvP. Thus, we think the value and role of crit would be too high in PvP without a way to mitigate that through stacking resilience. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/22748774679-resilience-requires-additional-alterations.html))<br />
<br />
PvE Gear in PvP<br />
I think teams may try to focus on PvE gear as a way of blowing up healers on the other team. If that doesn't work (because the healer has resilience), then the PvE-geared guys won't have the survivability to stick around long. If you can't blow people up very quickly, then the glass-cannon thing just doesn't work and longevity becomes more important to everyone. If you can blow up healers too easily (while wearing PvE gear), then we might need to buff resilience even more. If you can blow up dps specs wearing PvE gear easily, well, mission accomplished. If you can never defeat healers (note I said defeat, not blow up in 2 globals) then we will need to nerf healing. Again, the goal is to have slightly longer matches with a little more back and forth. (Emphasis on &quot;little&quot; -- 20 min matches can be as tedious as 20 sec matches are unsatisfying.) (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/11/22739754001-pvp-resilience-changes.html))<br />

End of Season Issues<br />
There was an issue on some realms that allowed rated arena matches to continue after maintenance completed today. We have identified these issues and ended the season on the affected realms.<br />
<br />
The arena season ended when maintenance began and the appropriate snapshot to decide the season's rewards was taken at that time. Any of the rated matches that took place after maintenance will not be counted for last season's rewards.</div></div><hr />

That would make PvP gear strictly for PvP and allows for healing throughput to be cut down in Arena.</div></div><hr />

In 2's and 3's its amazing how quickly someone can die. Now I think it will be somewhat manageable without having to pre-emptively go defensive. The burst will still be there, especially with the new gear, but it will be at least a 4GCD instead of a 3GCD lol.</div></div><hr />

This. It would slow down PvP battle, making strategy more important.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
so when you r in a full pvp set you can't get healed ?<br />
<br />
Well of course it would never go down to zero, just like incoming damage. You just receive less healing, while the opponent also deals a smaller amount of damage.</div></div><hr />

I call an idiot.<br />
<br />
Do some research, DKs(And druids) are the least viable pvp class. With yber 3 DKs(And druids) in the top 100 players(by arena rate).<br />
<br />
It was nearly impossible to kill a Rdruid or Hpala in 3.2... After SS nerf it is impossible unless the Rdruid/Hpala is a retard. After this... Even a monkey could tank a DK with a Rdruid/Hpala.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah and PvP is not about 1v1 duels either. Rdruids def ooms in 3v3, actually they are the most nerfed healer in 3v3 and 5v5 atm. Paladins might be OP right now, but that's something they need to change about the class, burst damage is still waay to freaking high in 3v3 and 5v5. Yes Rduids and Hpala might never oom in 2v2 but that bracket is pretty dead anyway so.</div></div><hr />

Okay i have to agree that Rdruid in 3v3 can oom and can't really even overheal the dmg... But something has to be done about Hpalas... They allrdy dominate all of the brackets after this there will be no stopping them! :)</div></div><hr />

Yeah trust me i hate Hpalas just as much as you do and i think they are insanely OP, it's just blizz has failed to acknowledge that yet...hopefully they will soon once Paladins represent 25% in top 100 ::)<br />

<br />
<br />
While possible, I don't think that will be the likely case. <br />
<br />
Healers, who benefit the most from Resilience, will not stack PvE gear because that will reduce survivability. <br />
DPS who wants to use PvE gear will use PvE gear regardless of Resilience reducing incoming heal. <br />

The reasoning behind Resil buff is: too much burst damage such that players are either in a full green bar state or a near-dead state. Either you landed a nuke heal just in time before your partner dies or you didn't. That is to say, the amount of healing is such a large portion of the full HP such that it is irrelevant. Only the timing of the heal is the key factor.<br />
<br />
The buff to Resil is supposed to create games where players are playing in a state between those 2 extremes. If you take away the Resilience from gear (i.e. PvE gear), then you're back to full-bar/near-dead state again so healing amount is a non-issue.</div></div><hr />

There's an entirely different reason than this one that it isn't a good idea.<br />

Warr and double healer requires large amounts of PvE gear on the warrior's part. (ArP and high AP are simply requirements)<br />

As a result, this is actually a nerf to that comp.</div></div><hr />

As it stands now, burst is out of control, no question, but so is healing. Right now in PvP you are either at full health, or dead. A healer has to be locked out of healing for the full duration of burning someone down, otherwise if your target doesn't die, they'll be healed to full in 1 GCD. Hopefully if a healing fix does come through, it applies to priest shields as well. This damage nerf is a step in the right direction, I'm just hoping they don't ignore the healing issue for too long.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Healers, who benefit the most from Resilience, will not stack PvE gear because that will reduce survivability. <br />
DPS who wants to use PvE gear will use PvE gear regardless of Resilience reducing incoming heal. <br />
<br />
The reasoning behind Resil buff is: too much burst damage such that players are either in a full green bar state or a near-dead state. Either you landed a nuke heal just in time before your partner dies or you didn't. That is to say, the amount of healing is such a large portion of the full HP such that it is irrelevant. Only the timing of the heal is the key factor.<br />
<br />
The buff to Resil is supposed to create games where players are playing in a state between those 2 extremes. If you take away the Resilience from gear (i.e. PvE gear), then you're back to full-bar/near-dead state again so healing amount is a non-issue.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I agree with the change in what they are attempting to do. Unfortunately I have such a lack of faith in their ability to &quot;get it right&quot; on the first, second or even third shot that I believe pvp is going to be nothing but frustration for several months. I can't remember how many patches it took for them to be comfortable with ret pallies. Now this comes and I believe this will also have many secondary side effect that Blizzard is not anticipating. <br />
<br />
That being the mana pools and regen of several classes, but I'm most familiar with ret pallies. Yes I rather grasp that most feel pallies are OP and with the sheer volume of the class it has some validity. However I feel it, yet again, is a secondary effect that Blizzard's B-team is not foreseeing. Ret pallies will go oom during fights if the fight takes twice as long (probably longer given that healers are the new equivalent of a raid boss) and once that occurs dps drops significantly. That was normal against resil stacked healers, but now will occur against virtually anyone and healers will be unsoloable by ret pallies. They make no mention of &quot;tweaking&quot; the mana pools of ret pallies to compensate for this resil change, which makes me believe they aren't even foreseeing it and will (hopefully) patch it later. They virtually built ret pallies to be burst oriented and now lopped their legs off.<br />
<br />
Essentially they are giving up on PvP for the remainder of the expansion and turning it into their personal testing ground. Promising to get all the bugs worked out so they can &quot;get it right&quot; in Cata. Like other posters, I question where their testing servers are (or apparent lack-thereof).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sometimes we think it's necessary to nerf something in PvP and PvE suffers collateral damage. The same is true of PvE changes. It's unfortunate, but we still think superior to having two separate games with completely different rule sets packaged in one box. (I realize you might feel differently, but let's not turn this thread into yet another debate on that topic.)<br />
<br />
In this case however, we are talking literally about an &quot;only in Arena / BG&quot; sort of thing. We don't like making changes like that, but if the resilience change ends up doing more harm than good, then we would still consider addressing it.<br />
<br />
In this particular case, if you don't PvP, you won't notice a change at all. In other situations, that may not be the case. <br />

I bet if healing does become a problem they'll apply a similar change where resilience will lessen its effect, seems like the next logical step to me. In the meantime l'll enjoy seeing how my priest fares after this change.</div></div><hr />

You apparently ignored his mention of BGs and WG PvP, which I'm assuming that's a larger population than the niche arena crowd. I love how arena people think pvp revolves around their small audience.. oh wait, that's what Blizzard has been doing.</div></div><hr />

This change does exactly the opposite. It's a nerf to some classes but a buff to others that are already too strong. With bursty damage, you might have had a chance to CC a healer and kill their partner but with this change, it will be good geared immortal healer taking barely any damage while prancing around the pillars and healing everyone full with 1-2 heals. The only difference is, bad geared players will be completely helpless and will just get worn down instead of 2 shot.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bamahut</div><div class="date">2010-01-21, 01:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">PvP Resilience Changes<br />
We are currently in the process of applying a hotfix to buff resilience. While some modifications may be made, we intend to have this buff in effect for the remainder of the Wrath of the Lich King expansion.<br />
<br />
The change will double the value of resilience in reducing damage done by players. So depending on their current amount of resilience, characters might experience a 10 to 20% decrease in damage taken from other players. The critical strike chance and critical strike damage reduction components of resilience will remain unaffected by this change.<br />
<br />
We are also aware of the possibility that this change will make healing in PvP too difficult to counter. While we are not making any immediate changes to address this issue, we have prepared some further changes that will allow us to quickly deploy a PvP-only healing adjustment if we feel it is warranted.<br />
<br />
We will be applying this change very soon while we are between Arena seasons so we can evaluate how it works in multiple PvP scenarios for the upcoming Arena season, and as we continue to prepare for Cataclysm. As we have mentioned previously, one of the goals for Cataclysm is to have a PvP environment where it is harder to regularly achieve so much damage and healing in relatively few global cooldowns compared to what we currently have in the game. <br />
<br />
<br />
Finally pvp gear us usefull again. This is what resillience should had been from the start!</div></div><hr />

Chill with your elitist attitude. Regarding your remark, in Vanilla that was exactly what they did. More so, talent changes were made to function better in the pve environment. There were no hotfixes due to a pillarhumping disadvantage or whatever.</div></div><hr />

if they are worried about healers then they can simply make changes to arena healing gear to have more spell power and less mana regen.The idea of beating a healer team is to either use startegy to clever put em out eg cc'ng them behind a pillar or target switching with good cc to run em oom.Healers are far from op at the moment certain classes are (your right there) this change shall hopefully prevent them from being &quot;two shot &quot; as you mentioned in your reply above.Especailly a healer, they sacrifrice dmage for heal power, being two shot as one isnt fair.</div></div><hr />

uhhhhh yeah. It's a lot easier to balance classes around 15v15 battles and the like. Hence why there wasnt too many problems with pvp affecting pve before arenas. But of course you wouldn't know that since arena was made to rope in tards like you to cash in on the absurd notion of an esport. Seriously go back to playing your xbox and yelling at your mom to bring you a hot pocket and leave wow to the upper crust of nerdom.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CCloak</div><div class="date">2010-01-21, 03:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">For an small insight,<br />
<br />
if you want pvp gear to be the most attractive gear for every class in the game,<br />
resilience as a defense only stat has to go away.<br />
<br />
Resilience should instead be a new stat that changes your character to become much more competitive when pvping instead. A few little concepts in mind:<br />
<br />
1. It is a modifier which evaluates your powerfulness against other players. A 1 resil against 1000 resil, the 1000 resil guy will deal 25% more dmg to 1 resil, while the 1 resil deals 25% less on the 1000 resil guy. 1000 vs 1000 will deal equal dmg on both sides. 0 resil will suffer extreme penalty on resil targets, dealing extra 25% less damage against even 1 resil players.<br />
<br />
2. 0 resil healers heals 0 resil targets by 100% efficiency. His efficiency is decreased to 50% when the healer or target gains 1 resil. At 500 the healer will output 75% on 0 resil targets, if the target also carries 1000 resil, the target will carry roughly 25% bonus healing(this bonus does not apply to self healing), only when the healer also carries at least 50% of the target's resilience. 500 resil healers thus heal at 100% on 1000 resil targets. Significant diminishing returns on bonus healing applies at 500 and more resil, and healing efficiency will not be higher than 100%. (This one is very awkward right now...getting it right is very hard)<br />
<br />
3. Cuts off avoidance stats(dodge, parry, defense)on gear by amount equal to dmg reduction/increase to discouraging tank gear on pvp. Avoidance caused by agility, strength and cooldowns are not reduced. (This is actually very hard to put on code)<br />
<br />
4. Resil at 1000 decreases mana usage by 15%. Also you burn/drain more mana on 1 resil targets by 15%, and 25% more on 0 resil targets, at the same time reduces equal amount of burn/drain mana on you. 0 resil targets, burns/drains extra 25% less mana on resilience targets. Efficiency of all mana regen abilities (excluding drinking, passive abilities) increased by 10% @ 1000.<br />
<br />
5. Healing debuffs (MS) should go away, or instead as a very short duration debuff with the applying abilities itself a cooldown. (i.e. a new form of CC)<br />
<br />
6. Resilience decreases the duration of all crowd control and healing debuffs effects by amount equal to damage reduction.<br />
<br />
7. Crit chance and Crit damage reduction unchanged.<br />
<br />
8. If certain pve weapons are considered overpowered in pvp(for example legendary weapons), they can be adjusted to also carry resilience reduction penalties if one chooses to use them on pvp.<br />
<br />
However, my concept has a very bad downside with newcomers trying to gear for pvp. You always go down the road of getting gibbed before gaining enough gear to really do something. Current Wintergrasp has made this a little bit less of a hassle only if you know how to do it right. Finally the numbers are only a picture, it is not very fine tuned or so.<br />
<br />

<br />
I think you’re mistaken as was the OP. <br />
<br />
If they removed PvP, many players (including me) would simply quit. Let me put it this way: PvE is all about fighting the same script over and over. Heck DBM Addon will tell you “move move move you’re walking over fire”. Do that every week. With patience, time and coordination you will beat a boss and somebody will get a nice upgrade. Rinse and repeat every week like a zombie. To a point where practice + small upgrades to 25 ppl will make it easier. <br />
<br />
That’s PvE. Player Vs. Script. <br />
<br />
PvP, although a pain in the a** with balance issues, *should* be more fun, dynamic and different. You don’t know what players are on that other BG team (or arena). You don’t know how they will react, what will they do to what you do. They may think faster, be better, etc.<br />
<br />
Sadly, PvP is *sometimes* broken and allows “exploits” here and there. But that’s not the point. You (as a PvE player), like to beat a predefined encounter with 24 friends. PvP players look for something different.<br />
<br />
Me? I’d forbid PvE gear on PvP scenarios. Give players a starting “entire” pvp set like you have for PvE. If you want to follow the PvP path, get your gear, put it on and start from there. <br />
<br />
But that’s just me.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Second</div><div class="date">2010-01-21, 04:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">While possible, I don't think that will be the likely case. <br />
<br />
Healers, who benefit the most from Resilience, will not stack PvE gear because that will reduce survivability. <br />
DPS who wants to use PvE gear will use PvE gear regardless of Resilience reducing incoming heal. <br />
<br />
The reasoning behind Resil buff is: too much burst damage such that players are either in a full green bar state or a near-dead state. Either you landed a nuke heal just in time before your partner dies or you didn't. That is to say, the amount of healing is such a large portion of the full HP such that it is irrelevant. Only the timing of the heal is the key factor.<br />
<br />
The buff to Resil is supposed to create games where players are playing in a state between those 2 extremes. If you take away the Resilience from gear (i.e. PvE gear), then you're back to full-bar/near-dead state again so healing amount is a non-issue.<br />
<br />
<br />
Tbh you are considering it from wrong side.<br />
Incoming heals nerf with resilience is the bad solution becouse :<br />
- you get resilience buff on survivability, you lose approximately same amount on healing done (subject to number adjusting)<br />
- this also dont solve the issue with healer+dps (in any amount) becouse that would only promote dps to use more pve gear in pvp environment (with healers with resilience buff + nerf at the same time)<br />
<br />
I am fine with healing nerf if they feel like its needed (GC mentioned that), but if it should affect healing then it should be healing done, not received.<br />
<br />
Now, when you read it once more, you will notice that this case would be healing nerf to ALL having resilience, thus even worse case then one mentioned by few (healing received). Yet, its not perfect. In this case you wouldn't motivate fully dps teams (mostly 2v2, but also larger scale pvp) to run with pvp gear in pvp environment.<br />
<br />
Best, but really lazy solution would be to place some sort of pvp debuff (was thinking about arena + bgs only, but that would be unfair to wPvP) that would reduce your healing received - in other words :<br />
If you got pvp mark on, and you are healed by pvp marked player/npc this healing is reduced by X%.<br />
(also notice when you are healing pvp marked player, you will get pvp mark also, so wouldnt produce pve-&gt;pvp healing)<br />
<br />
Would like to hear your comments.</div></div><hr />

It is just you, as the person I quoted pointed out. (Generalizing 'you' being the niche of players who play Arena, not necessarily just the one player who posts on these forums and yadda yadda yadda). Removing Arena wouldn't kill PVP, the reverse happening contrary to popular belief (Less people PVPing the more Arena tries to be more mainstream. While not fixing any of it's problems, see Mortal Kombat).<br />
<br />
As anyone who plays a fighting game (and pokemon, for some reason) will tell you, fighting scripted/CPU enemies just isn't as fun as fighting people who can't be outsmarted by going against a certain pattern. This mentality is fine and helps drive those pushing for a more competitive community, as any said players will tell you.<br />
<br />
The problem with Arena, as with any &quot;bad&quot; competitive game, is that it's been plagued with poor implementation from the get go, common complaints arising from all kinds of players across the spectrum.</div></div><hr />

<br />
See I have to disagree. I don't think things were balanced around world pvp and BGs so much as they just weren't really balanced at all. I very definitely remember some players being one-shot back then, and it must have sucked to be them. You could argue that it was better for you personally had the game remained imbalanced, but there's no way to argue that imbalance supports a healthy or fun gaming experience for most players... especially for a game that revolves around two separately playable warring factions. Balance would have come into play eventually, but at least for the time being its focus is on a highly controlled and regulated situation... 3v3 arena.<br />
<br />
It will be interesting to see what kinds of issues pop up once rated bgs come into the picture, though.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

Yeah because as a priest for example then i do have an 70% ms against a hunter and an 95% ms against a warrior with proc right? GREAT IDEA! How long do you think i am going to survive? 10secs? Let's remove pillars to, they reduce the damage of casterzergs and hunters, also is kinda annoying for charging warriors or feral and death gripping deathknights.<br />
<br />
This thread is full of fail. I mean, why the hell are the people complaining pve'ers? BGs are no pvp anymore. AV is a PvE event, Isle and SotA SUCK and i personally don't know anybody who likes those. WSG and AB are still funny yes, but arena still is the most popular sort of PvP. And one more thing to the people who talk about world PvP. You seriously play Wrath of the Lich King, WoW's second xpac?<br />
<br />
Also someone metioned that you shouldn't have to farm PvP gear to play PvP. It's an MMORPG and it's about equipment and upgrades or can you down prof. putricide in Naxx10 gear? Maybe you shouldn't have to farm PvE gear for PvE? NO the bosse would be even more easy right? One more reason to QQ. There'll never be a perfect change for everybody. In my eyes this change is nice. I am sick of being beastcleaved or facerolled by tsg as a priest. It's so damn annoying because you can't do anything in most of the cases. Do one little positioning mistake and you'r done for, sometimes it seams like you even don't have to make a mistake and still die.</div></div><hr />

<br />
correct, but in the and they have to fix the incoming loads of pve gear. I mean warriors lolstorming with Shadowmourne + some trinket proc + ring proc aren't going to be funny for any healer, especially priests.<br />
<br />
Same problem with evenom rogue. They do a hell of damage at the moment in s7 with pure pvp gear (something loke 6k+ evenoms). i don't want to know for how much they are going to hit me in ICC hardmode gear. I don't wan PvE gear to be banished from arenas. I mean if someone spends his time on doing PvP + PvE he should have some sort of advantage.<br />

If we were to compare every class to a Boomkin in pvp that would mean that every spec is soooo OP that they need to be removed. What we need to do is compare classes and viable specs.<br />

Ugh, I play resto shaman wich is the WORST healer of all. omg! But i still see no reason to qq since we're still able to outperform most specs in arena.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That’s true. A priest can be easily caught in the wrong spot. In order to reach high ratings with a priest you need a very good partner(s) that possibly have played priest and know what you can and can’t do. <br />
<br />
A priest without adequate pressure is ok. A priest with good opponents can be good. A priest with a tunnel vision melee on him is dead (especially if he has to dispel, heal, LOS, CC, run, kite, etc.).<br />
<br />
As any high rated priest can confirm, it takes excellent partners to go beyond 1500… that was my experience when I played priest anyway. And my last dedicated season was S5, which was hard for priests and couldn’t pass 1800. (hunters!)</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. Arena without a healing class dont have very high surviability compared to healers true they have more dmg than a arena team with a healer but dmg is nerfed due to reislience already! you CAN NOT crit 20k dmg but YOU CAN crit 20k heals, reducing dmg taken will defently a plus to give arenas without a healer a fighting chance, but healing will need to be nerfed with the dmg reduction otherwise nothing will change in this prespective.<br />
<br />
2. Heres a reason y a healler would need it, try to follow.. rogue cheap shots *sign* rogue kidneyshots you fall on the floor kicking and screaming, rogue blinds... u decided to make a waffle. rogue restealth and cheapshots u eat the waffle... rogue kidney shots u'v already quit wow. (pvp trinket? vanish cheap shot gg)<br />
<br />
3. I aggree with reduced healing, healers are OP. instant heal penence all wtf heal but healers can be cc'd down with stuns (i have rogue arena parter *im reti pala*) I know we can stun and kill healer in stun, cause if we dont even with wound posion relentless geared healers are still stupid hard to take down. My point is, make them harder to damage, but reduce there healing at lest give them a chance to LIVE long enough to fight back with cooldowns etc.<br />
<br />
Thats my own opinion burst dmg is to high, my teams rogue + reti pala out dmg is very high can ignore healers... even on warriors we nuke down prot wars with resto druid healing him (isnt sapable as tree) and prot wars have way more dmg reduction than the rest. Pve specs dont belong in arena, if he was arms bladestorm all lockdowns useless more viable even with healing reduction. Further more healers are with partners, wheres ur partner to save ur ass if u get facerolled in 3-4 seconds?<br />
<br />
I Am surprised no1 has even mentioned this, feral druids with dmg recution would make pvp gear BETTER then pve gear for tanking? the healing reduction has to go with resilience or druids will just wear pvp gear, and the helaing reduction with reselience would have to be global not just BG/arena.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That being said I would also welcome a healing reduction aspect of resil. Yes, to some players the challenge and strategy that PvP could offer is still welcome. <br />

I played back then, so yea, rated battlegrounds should be cool. Hopefully we get some new maps. Maybe Blizzard will stop the madness of making a different game-style for every new map and simply keep old CTF(wsg)/KOTH(ab) styles with brand new maps. Hell, even design a couple maps that are good for both game types.<br />

This resil fix is much needed but not this fast, this will most likely fuck up months of season 8. Cant drop a change like this without considering the effects it has on every spec. When healing goes live and basicly burst is down, some classes will actually be getting a buff from this, some will see huge nerfs.</div></div><hr />

This change makes me want to play a demo warlock. 6% reduction from molten skin. 25% from glypthed soul link and another 5% from master demo (or 10% melee or 10% spell depending on pet).<br />
<br />
So thats 36% reduction against all damage and add another 30% from resi. Thats some serious mitigation.</div></div><hr />

Burst was only an issue if there was such a huge gear gap and I only saw it on non-disc priest clothies. Disc priest clothies could easily laugh away the damage without worrying about a Ret paladin.

your point?Who cares about MS when you shoot peeps in 2 gcd? And these &quot;1shot&quot; teams often have MS person &quot;just to be sure&quot;. And that MS person is rogue most of the time because of stunlock.<br />
Please show me the warrior that hits for at least 8k average like destro-elem-frosties do on PvP geared target. Will not happen even with new legendary weapon.<br />

Rated battlegrounds for great gear would be awesome in theory because I love BGs and loved when I was in a pvp guild doing these in BC.

<br />
For me resil should be something like that:<br />
<br />
1k of resil should reduce damage like 50% or 60%<br />
but one of benefit of resil should be ingore others resil, something like resil penetration, and if you had the same 1k of resilience you could have 30 to 40% resil penetration and ignore it. So if you have two players each other with 1k resil, they ignore 20% of damage, like it does now. But if you have 1k of resil and a full pve player attack you, he get your damage reduced 60%.<br />
<br />
Of course the amount dont need to be exactly those, i just put some fictional amount, but for me, should be something like that.</div></div><hr />

if they put in the reduction to healing, it means 50% MS will really be a 70% MS if you have 20% reduce healing buff?<br />
yeah thats really fun to heal through..... O_o<br />
<br />
<br />
ROFL... stop and think about what you said for a second. First of all, if they did a healing reduction, the interaction with MS would be multiplicative, not additive. Second, there is less damage to heal..... get it?</div></div><hr />

<br />
That would make PvP gear strictly for PvP and allows for healing throughput to be cut down in Arena.<br />
<br />
<br />
That would be nice when BiS druid tanking items are pvp items because of bad itemization... Sigh</div></div><hr />
