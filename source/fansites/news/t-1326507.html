Item Level Squish Feedback<br />
Demonstrating why we warn you about taking translated interviews as fact, Ghostcrawler mentioned today that he did not confirm an upcoming item squish, along with answering a few common concerns. You can take part in the ongoing discussion here (http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/1326163-Item-Squish-Confirmed).<br />
mmo-champion says item squish soon confirmed. Please do not regress my character. I worked hard to get him to where he is.<br />
I didn't confirm it. Still we think there are a lot of good reasons to get numbers down to more parsable levels. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362307978944200705))<br />
100m, 100k, and 100 are all equally 'parsable'. It's all about formatting.<br />
We describe automobile speed in miles / kilometers per hour and not inches / cms, because big numbers are awkard. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362360714142302211))<br />
Exactly. We use KILOmeters per hour. What's the problem with using KILOdamage per second?<br />
That's the mega damage solution, and we're just worried it will look a little silly. You crit for 200 MEGADAMAGE! (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362454654493270016))<br />
<br />
I now have to find 24 other people to do BT/DS/BWL/ICC and follow mechanics just for pets and mog gear? no ty!<br />
I have said several times that item squish would not affect the ability to solo old content. That's not the intent. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362451031138893824))<br />
<br />
But can you nerf every player without in anyway effecting soloing low level content? Keep everything the same but the numbers?<br />
&quot;If player enters old instance, then buff all their stats.&quot; (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362453330179534850))<br />

Patch 5.4 - Change to RPPM Mechanics<br />
We think the cooldown lineup at the start of PvE encounters has gotten out of hand, and it’s having some rather negative effects on gameplay. Particularly with the number of RPPM procs most raiders have these days, the pull has just become way too important. It’s affecting gearing, it’s punishing classes that can’t capitalize on it as well as others, and it’s not how we’d like raiding to work.<br />
<br />
To that end, we’re going to make another change to how RPPM mechanics work on the pull. Starting a raid encounter will set every RPPM proc’s “time since last proc” to 90 seconds. That means the more frequent procs will still be more or less guaranteed to go off, but the rarer (and more powerful) procs will just have a high chance. This should hopefully chill things out a little bit, without changing how you play too dramatically.<br />
<br />
Can we clarify what 'rarer' RPPM procs are? We talking the meta-gem here? <br />
We're not changing the actual RPPM proc rates at all, just how much time is &quot;banked&quot; before the pull. The underlying math that determines what the actual chances are isn't changing.<br />
<br />
So, here's a couple hypothetical examples using very rough napkin math. I don't remember RPPMs for actual trinkets off the top of my head (and they're not particularly necessary for illustration purposes):<br />
<br />
Trinket A has an RPPM that allows it to reach a 100% proc chance if it hasn't fired after 60 seconds. This trinket will have a guaranteed proc on the pull.<br />
<br />
Trinket B has an RPPM that allows it to reach a 100% proc chance if it hasn't fired after 100 seconds. It will not be guaranteed to proc immediately, but will proc within the first 10 seconds.<br />
<br />
Trinket C has an RPPM that allows it to reach a 100% proc chance after 2 minutes. It will not be guaranteed to proc immediately (regardless of how much time you've spent out of combat), but will proc within the first 30 seconds.<br />
<br />
Make sense?<br />
<br />
My 502 UVLS doesn't have a guaranteed proc chance 2 minutes in though. Lore's example needs a trinket D, which is only guaranteed in excess of 6 minutes of no procs. <br />
This is true -- some trinkets will now be unlikely to proc immediately (which is the point of the change). However, it should be noted that it's extremely unlikely for any RPPM proc to take until it hits a 100% chance to activate anyway.<br />
<br />
Guilds are still going to wait. This change is good, but it's not good enough. <br />
Aside from the fact that most groups wouldn't be ready for another pull within 90 seconds anyway, waiting has no effect whatsoever. As soon as a raid encounter is pulled, the time since last proc for all RPPM mechanics in the raid will be set to exactly 90 seconds. Doesn't matter if it's been 10 seconds or 10 minutes since the last pull.<br />
<br />
I do want to say, this is distinctly a nerf to fun. It WAS A LOT of fun to open up full force pot, cloak, enchant, 2xtrinkets, meta, stormlash, + elemental + lava burst. I was hitting 75,000 spellpower <br />
I feel like the &quot;nerf to fun&quot; argument gets overstated quite a bit. We're not nerfing it because it was fun, we're nerfing it because it was breaking the game.<br />
<br />
I'm sure a lot of players would find it fun to be able to take down Heroic Lei Shen with a single spell. That doesn't make it good gameplay.<br />
<br />
I'm skeptical to the idea that not getting a proc in the initial burst will somehow make these trinkets not worth using. After that first proc on the pull, the time since last proc is 0 anyway. It'll tone back the initial burst, definitely, but I'm not convinced that the entire value of a trinket like Unerring Vision of Lei Shen depends on that first proc.<br />
<br />

Patch 5.4 Arena Changes<br />
Yeah, i miss the teamnames but the patch is still going to be really good. <br />
We understand that there are some players that will miss the customization and comradeship that came with arena teams. We're looking into ways in which we will be able to retain these particular feelings in arena after these changes occur, but at this time we don't have anything to share in this regard. <br />
<br />
I wonder how the ladders will look now. Players with highest ratings etc? I hope they thought this through thoroughly. <br />
The ladders will show individual players and their rankings will be based off of their personal rating. End of season rewards will still be awarded in the same manner as they are now, to the top &quot;X&quot;% of competitors, the percentage of course being different depending on the reward.<br />
<br />
So it's all 100% individual? If I play with a team to 2600 and one of my teammates ends on 2560 and cutoff is 2570 he wont get a reward? <br />
Well, while you may play with a few specific players and you consider yourselves a team, you're not actually in a set team. But this is also the case as if he also got the title just for playing with you, because there are no teams in 5.4 you could also feed the title to anyone that you wanted who was just under the cutoff.<br />
<br />
Don't encourage wintrading... <br />
I feel that I need to clarify on my last post as there was some misunderstanding of what I meant. I was not promoting win trading, nor was I saying that you will be able to feed your end of season rewards to others. I wanted to point out that if the system worked as Easydragon questioned, then you could feed your rewards to others if they were just under the cut-off because there are no set teams. Don't worry as you won't be able to feed the title to others by playing with them, the rewards are based off of your own personal ratings alone. <br />
<br />
I apologize for any confusion my post may have caused, I have now rephrased it to clarify the above points. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/265335-pvp-revived-in-54/) / Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/7860656533?page=2#30))<br />
<br />
Utility and Hunters<br />
So, this isn't solely specific to Hunters, but since it's an issue I see you guys bring up a lot, I want to talk briefly about &quot;utility.&quot;<br />
<br />
From a top-down perspective, our design philosophy regarding utility goes something like this: everyone brings some sort of benefit to the group, but no one gets an invite based solely on that benefit. We feel that current class mechanics satisfy the first part of that. We're mostly there with the second half, with some exceptions.<br />
<br />
Sometimes we just make something too strong to the point that it feels mandatory. That's absolutely true. A current example would be Demonic Gateway, particularly in PvE. It gives a very large benefit in many encounters, and since more Gateways are nearly always a good thing, many raid teams will seek to bring as many Warlocks as they can (though obviously, Warlock DPS has been a factor as well). In that particular case, we're making some changes in 5.4 and, if necessary, may continue to make changes.<br />
<br />
The reason I bring that up is that it has the tendency to cast a harsher light than is probably fair on other classes. We feel that, ignoring the extreme outliers like Demonic Gateway, Hunters bring an acceptable amount of utility. Every Hunter has Trueshot Aura and access to an array of buffs and debuffs through their pets (even if not specced Beast Mastery), and abilities like Misdirection and Ice Trap which can be valuable on some encounters. If that's not enough utility to guarantee you a raid invite... then good. We'd rather you get your invite by being a solid raider with good performance.<br />
<br />
I'm also slightly confused as to the logic behind some arguments, specifically those along the lines of &quot;our DPS is low, so we need more utility to justify our raid slot.&quot; If that's the case, wouldn't you prefer we fix your damage output and/or tone down the overperformers?<br />
<br />
I know this doesn't address every concern that's been brought up, and I apologize for that. If and when we have more to share, we will. But I did want to at least shed some light on our thoughts on the &quot;utility&quot; issue overall, for the sake of discussion.<br />
<br />
Oh, one thing I can share: we like the idea of removing the focus cost from Dash, so we're going to. That includes Dive and Charge as well.<br />
<br />
As has been mentioned in other &quot;utility&quot; threads, part of the problem here is that nobody agrees on what &quot;utility&quot; is. Is the dev definition of the word something you can shed a little light on? (I realize that may raise the &quot;it's a trap!&quot; alarm, so feel free to ignore if you think that would do more harm than good.)<br />
<br />
My own working definition for a few years now has been: anything that is beneficial to the group, while in combat, that doesn't pertain directly to my personal performance in my role. Which basically, for a DPS class, would mean anything that doesn't cause me and only me to deal additional damage, and isn't an out-of-combat thing like summoning.<br />
This is probably pretty close to our definition. As you mention, it's the sort of thing that I'd be hesitant to try to define precisely (it's something of a fluid term even internally).<br />
<br />
Do you think it's fair that certain abilities (namely Ancient Hysteria and battle rez) are locked to Beast Mastery only? If it's a 25 man situation, probably, but in 10 man you do run the issue of not having either of these. Sometimes that could lead to Hunter's feeling as though they must have Beast Mastery as a spec.<br />
It's something I can bring up again, but we do like these as Beast Mastery perks. Note that, at least in the case of Ancient Hysteria, 5.4 is adding Drums of Rage (a consumable form of Bloodlust/Heroism made by Leatherworkers) that, while not quite as effective as the Beast Mastery buff, should make things at least a little more flexible for 10-mans.

RPPM scaling with Runespeed Mechanics<br />
As an update to this, since we've seen some confusion, Improved Unholy Presence is getting the same treatment as Unholy Presence, meaning it will now grant additional haste, not just additional attack speed and rune regen. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/265263-rppm-scaling-with-runespeed-mechanics/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/9561126353?page=4#74))<br />
<br />
<br />
PTR Testing and You<br />
From Zul’Gurub and Ahn’Qiraj onward, we have made extensive use of our Public Test Realms in order to help find bugs and improve the tuning of our raid content. We have an extensive team of Quality Assurance testers and an internal raid group, but it’s impossible to replicate the sheer breadth of information we get from having hundreds of real raid groups attempting diverse strategies as they experience encounters for the first time. We learn a tremendous amount from that testing, both in the form of written feedback on these forums, which is carefully read by every encounter designer, and from spectating raids and observing how they fare. <br />
<br />
Now, that’s what we get out of the PTR. Speaking pragmatically, we understand that not everyone's motivation in logging on to the PTR is to give us feedback. They want to check out the new content firsthand, see what’s coming to the live servers in a few weeks or months, and, in the case of raiding, get some competitive edge that will help them clear the content faster on the live servers when the patch is released. That’s fine. We thoroughly appreciate everyone who takes the time to give measured feedback, or goes out of their way to methodically test new features and report bugs they find. But at the end of the day, we’d rather have a packed PTR with a small percentage giving direct feedback, than a nearly-empty PTR where everyone gives it. Bugs that require very specific conditions are much more likely to occur with thousands of testers than with hundreds, and it’s clearly beneficial to everyone for us to find and fix those issues before they affect millions in a live environment.<br />
<br />
When it comes to raid testing in particular, there’s a symbiotic relationship: The bleeding-edge guild that intentionally wipes to a boss at 5% so they can set up their boss addons, try out unusual strategies, and practice execution is there for competitive reasons. But we gain information even just from silently observing that will help us make our encounters better, and fundamentally, that is the purpose of raid testing on PTR. Our raid testing times are scheduled to coincide with our core work hours, so that designers can observe as much of the testing as possible, with the exception of LFR and Flexible tests which require more open-ended scheduling given their nature and target audience (and even then, if you were doing a PTR Flexible raid this past weekend, odds are decent that I or another developer was spying on your group – creepy, I know). When it comes to Heroic testing, we try to keep the testing windows as brief as possible, in order to minimize the impact of PTR testing on the progression “race.”<br />
<br />
But that symbiotic relationship requires that we be around in some capacity to observe. Players who find a way to access bosses (especially Heroic bosses) that aren’t currently being tested should let us know, so we can correct the problem. We discovered that over the weekend a progression raid group accessed the Siege of Orgrimmar raid and spent hours on a Heroic boss in the middle of the night, after copying fresh characters with generic names, presumably with the hope of going unnoticed. Those actions go against the intent of the PTR, the spirit of fair play, and were clearly intended to go against our wishes for specific boss testing periods. PTR testing is a privilege, and we reserve the right to revoke PTR access from those who have shown an intent to abuse it.<br />
<br />
If you come across an oversight in our testing protocols, or a serious, abusable bug or exploit in the course of your testing of a boss encounter on PTR, and you want to let us know without alerting everyone, please note that we can read edited or deleted forum posts. (On the live servers, please use the in-game bug reporting interface.) Otherwise, carry on with the fantastic feedback that we’ve been receiving about all facets of 5.4 content thus far, and we look forward to seeing you on the Public Test Realm!<br />

<br />
If that were the case, wouldn't a better solution be a debuff to all enemies when a high-level player enters an old dungeon/raid? Thinking along these lines, why not have something like this working in the background that scales all PvE encounters up/down based upon level differences? That would allow numbers to remain manageable and allow character power to remain proportionate to previous content.</div></div><hr />

I think its sorta funny how people still think that old content will somehow get harder with a squish even though everything in this game is based on a scale on very little on numbers.</div></div><hr />

Its probably easier to code buffs to a single person then it is debuffs to an entire dungeon/raid.<br />

Cry much over having to get out of a fire for optional rewards which shouldnt be the case if squish is done right. <br />

<br />

Well numbers would have to be dropped anyways for every mob in the game. Blizzard might just bump some raid bosses down a few extra notches to be on the safe side. A debuff or buff for higher level players is a way to go as GC mentioned if the developers really want to ensure that everyone can solo which today isnt the case as a number of classes are horrible with raid boss soloing. The developers have made changes to help facilitate soloing of old content but still make the statement that it isnt their goal to fully support soloing.</div></div><hr />

OMG. I would LOVE it if older content is not soloable anymore. It is somehow boring and contradicts the aim of the game if you can solo through 95 percent of the world.<br />
Just the other day some 72's asked in our guild for a BT raid and the only answer he got was: &quot;Become 90 then you can solo it.&quot; Yeah, very nice and so much fun.<br />

As I see it, Blizzard is the one lacking common sense.<br />

Because quite frankly, I don't think anyone thinks Blizzard knows what the hell they are talking about, or if they even have a cohesive plan (if they ever actually did). I don't see a real way forward with all these GC comments, all I see is pie-in-the-sky hugs and kisses.</div></div><hr />

Something like this?<br />
I do want to say, this is distinctly a nerf to fun. It WAS A LOT of fun to open up full force pot, cloak, enchant, 2xtrinkets, meta, stormlash, + elemental + lava burst. I was hitting 75,000 spellpower <br />

warcraft is just one big set of complex calculations involving numbers. You saying that is tantamount to saying who gives a shit about DNA in biology or physics in flying aircraft.<br />
<br />
having 5 digits worth of stats on gear is ludicrous. things may be fine now but by the next expansion we'll really be hitting ridiculous numbers<br />

<br />
Actually its the vocal minority thats opposing this. Blizz, bereft of people who want it, have wished to do an item squish because of what they're seeing when designing dps and stats. the feedback from calculations and the appearance of gear.<br />
<br />
This isnt a nerf. The Ratio's are the goddamn same. instead of saying we're gonna travel 328,084 feet, we're gonna say we're traveling 100km. instead of 97630 yen, we're saying we have 1000 dollars. Its worth the damn same.<br />
<br />
It's gonna be cumbersome as hell comparing blue items with stats that have 5 frikkin digits each. the numbers we throw out will just be meaningless 7 digit long bunches.<br />
<br />
It's not a problem in MoP, but if the next expac follows the same jump like the previous expacs, it will reach a point where the numbers are burying us or unintuitive at a glance. <br />
<br />
you hit a mob for 1million damage and take out 10% of its health. after the squish you hit a mob for 6000 and take away 10% of its health.<br />
<br />
Massive numbers inflation is never a good thing to develop and base judgements on for any sort of system.</div></div><hr />

If I crit for 500,000 or 50,000 why would most people find one more confusing than the other? Higher numbers are not more difficult to understand imo. What I do believe though is that seeing my numbers go DOWN because suddenly we have all been squished will feel very meh to a lot of people (myself included). Yes we would still have the same power in relation to mobs/bosses as we have now, and in most cases it probably will not make low level content harder to solo (some exceptions could be as you get to previous expac to current maybe), but it would still FEEL like we are less powerful. That to me would feel very disappointing. If it happens, then after a few months we probably wont feel that way anymore but I still don't want to have my characters go through a phase in their &quot;lives&quot; where they went though a strange world event whereby everyone/thing turned into a weakling.</div></div><hr />

please people, just THINK about saying you're gonna travel 328,084 feet rather than say 100 km. in general conversation and decisions making, 328,084 feet is much more meaningless to an individual compared to just saying 100km.<br />
<br />
it wont feel like we're less powerful at all, how we feel is dependent on our performance and when we HIT a creature, it is still going to get horrifically hurt and crumple in the dust and we will be happy about it. Not because of the numbers flying above its head. but because we hit it and a chunk of its health flew off and it made the pain audio blizz set up for it.<br />
<br />
its the difference between driving a noisy as shit motor bike thats making you literally deaf so you dont hear the truck flattening into paste and putting a muffler on that damn thing. same bike, same power between your legs, no sensory overload/numbness.<br />

Keep everything the same but the numbers? &quot;If player enters old instance, then buff all their stats.&quot;<br />
<br />
This is a nutty solution. So we'll be doing 1M DPS next expansion but only when in old raids? Out in the world we'll do less than we are doing now. How fake does this game need to get? 4 difficulties is enough, now stat scaling depending on where you are? They are basically admitting it's too much work to correctly do an item squish, so they'll just throw buffs on players when they are doing old content. Do it correctly or don't do it at all. My vote is not at all, it is too much work and displeases way to many people. Condense the numbers with a UI setting but keep them the same. There's no need for &quot;MEGADAMAGE&quot;. Simply format numbers as 100k, 74k, 100M, 10B, etc..<br />
<br />
If I wanted stat scaling, i'd be playing GW2.</div></div><hr />

The thing is I DO believe it will feel bad.... Even GC agreed with that back in 2012 when he said (source (http://www.tankspot.com/showthread.php?79087-MoP-Press-Tour-Interview-with-Greg-quot-Ghostcrawler-quot-Street)):<br />
<br />
<br />
We had the whole thing implemented, and we sat down and tried it out, and, you know, Mortal Strike hit for 200, and Fireball hit for 150, and we were like, “This feels wrong.” We knew exactly how it would feel like, and we knew that our damage as a percentage didn’t go down, but it felt terrible.<br />
<br />
I don't believe this has changed. I believe it will feel very odd to be suddenly doing smaller numbers. <br />
<br />
Ultimately, if it happens it happens and only time will REALLY tell how the community reacts to it. It MAY disappoint me if it happens, but it's not going to stop me playing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
having 5 digits worth of stats on gear is ludicrous. things may be fine now but by the next expansion we'll really be hitting ridiculous numbers<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Actually its the vocal minority thats opposing this. Blizz, bereft of people who want it, have wished to do an item squish because of what they're seeing when designing dps and stats. the feedback from calculations and the appearance of gear.<br />
<br />
This isnt a nerf. The Ratio's are the goddamn same. instead of saying we're gonna travel 328,084 feet, we're gonna say we're traveling 100km. instead of 97630 yen, we're saying we have 1000 dollars. Its worth the damn same.<br />
<br />
It's gonna be cumbersome as hell comparing blue items with stats that have 5 frikkin digits each. the numbers we throw out will just be meaningless 7 digit long bunches.<br />
<br />
It's not a problem in MoP, but if the next expac follows the same jump like the previous expacs, it will reach a point where the numbers are burying us or unintuitive at a glance. <br />
<br />
you hit a mob for 1million damage and take out 10% of its health. after the squish you hit a mob for 6000 and take away 10% of its health.<br />
<br />
Massive numbers inflation is never a good thing to develop and base judgements on for any sort of system.<br />

<br />
Who cares how the game feels? Let's just add a difficulty setting in the corner of your game where you can toggle a difficulty out in the world. Lets have it even affect PVP and people on easy will have a handicap in BGs/Arenas. I mean who cares if it doesn't feel right?<br />
<br />
Seriously, my point is... how a game FEELS is everything. The item squish makes it feel like we're going back to classic. I raided in classic, I don't want to feel like that again i've already been there done that. Your average casual gamer is going to log in the game, see the squished numbers and quit the game. It's too big of a change, and it feels too weird. At one point last year, GC even admitted their own employees did not like the number squish and that's why it didn't happen for MoP! Even if they do the item squish correctly, and all content is still perfectly scaled, it will still feel like a huge nerf and be awkward.<br />
<br />
As for the calculations, your exaggerating. Most of your FPS issues or lockups are due to other things, the number calculations are a tiny part of why your FPS is lower. If your getting complete lockups, it's your computer. My computer has never experienced this, and even on Ultra my FPS is fine during world bosses and 25mans. Turn your settings down, or stop playing on a potato expecting to max the game out. Your FPS and lockups are most likely due to your settings being too high, not the numbers being too big.<br />
<br />

<br />
Exactly, agree 100%. This change will cause a massive drop in subs even if it is correctly implemented. Judging by GC's recent tweets, they will not even be correctly implementing it either. They will take the lazy way and just add buffs to characters in old raids so they can still solo. It all feels so fake, we'll end up doing 1M DPS in Molten Core.. then go outside and do 5K DPS. I would wager that this would be the single biggest mistake Blizzard is debating on doing. It completely changes the feel of the game, for the worse.<br />
<br />
If people wanted all these dynamic stat changes and scaling, they'd be playing a game like GW2. The main reason I stopped playing GW2 was because I felt like nothing mattered. No matter what you are scaled and stat capped, it all felt so fake to me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because those people understand math. After item squish level appropriate content will be just the same like it is currently. Overleveling group content will be different. Why? Let me explain.<br />
<br />
The reason we need the item squish is because exponential stat increase which causes us to have huge power surges between expansions. The reason we can solo old raid content is because we have these exponential power surges. The item squish will remove them so that instead of exponential we will have linear increase.<br />
<br />
What this means is that 40 lvl 60 players against ragnaros after the squish will be the same as 40 lvl 60 players against ragnaros now. This is because numbers from the both sides are squashed. As the exponential growth is removed 1 lvl 90 after the squish it will be far more worse than what it is now. Blizzard knows this and that's why GC suggested a buff for high lvl players inside old raids. That is very artificial and problematic way to work it since the buff would have to be different for people with different levels or otherwise you would get weird results.<br />
<br />
Also outdoor pvp issues are something I haven't seen them talk about at all. Currently 2 lvl 85 players would get their asses handed to them by a single lvl 90. After the squish it could go the other way. It's all about relative power. People are thinking that item squish will keep the ratios but it won't. Ratios will only be the same when you are doing appropriate content for your level.</div></div><hr />

No everything can be scaled easily, your not thinking big picture. All the ratios can be brought closer together with the same exponential grow. They just have to stop using full percentages with their scaling.</div></div><hr />

Yes, this is true but it would require a lot of man hours and lot of tweaking to get it right. It's not as simple as running a % based number reduction across the game like many people seem to think. If you read the tweets by GC, he already said how they plan on doing it. They are just going to give buffs to higher level people in old raids, which is a rather terrible concept in my eyes. https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362453330179534850<br />
<br />
They keep making the game feel faker and faker, there's no surprise they keep losing subs. I don't want my character to be stronger in some areas, than weaker in others. This change will be the biggest sub loss for them, I am certain. They just can't seem to grasp that their main player base, casuals, do not want major changes.<br />
<br />
<br />
You have to realize they are working with a 12 year old game engine that they cannot rebuild because it would alienate a lot of the player base that still use low end pc's, so the item crunch is the only way.<br />
<br />
What about the players that have been playing since launch, and keep playing for bigger numbers and the sense of getting stronger. A large chunk of the player base thinks this way and plays for personal character development. Now they go from doing big numbers to tiny numbers, and feel weaker. You cannot tell me that if they did something like this in Diablo 3 that the entire player base wouldn't freak out. Lots of players use numbers as a sense of strength, by lower these you piss off a lot of the fanbase.<br />
<br />
There is nothing stopping people from upgrading their low end PCs. It's in the terms that the games requirements will raise overtime and it is up to the user to upgrade their computer. Big numbers play a very small part in the overall performance of the game, and would only make a large difference on people with very cheap and very old computers. Computers that should of been upgraded years ago. Why should the entire playerbase have to deal with a number squish because John wants to play on his $150 e-machine that he bought 8 years ago? <br />
<br />
The argument goes both ways, by doing the number squish you will piss off a lot of people that have the &quot;bigger numbers&quot; mentality. This is a LARGE chunk of the player base. By not doing the number squish, you piss off the people who refuse to upgrade their incredibly out dated systems, or want to play on higher settings than they should be. The people who have the argument &quot;I'm tired of seeing giant numbers&quot; can be resolved with addons or a future patch that condenses numbers into better formatting, such as 100K, 100M, 100B, etc.</div></div><hr />

Transitioning between expansions isn't smooth at all. As you level through one expansion, you keep getting slight upgrades. As soon as you hit a new expansion, the numbers increase dramatically. You get such a huge increase in power for no reason. We have gear with 2000 Stamina on it now. There is no reason why it can't be scaled back to say, 200. Yes, you would see your damage decrease but the amount of time it takes to kill enemies wouldn't be any greater because the enemies would be scaled back as well. I just think it would really help bring the game in line regarding gear scaling in the future.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You didn't really answer his question though, why exactly does this bother you? It makes the game feel rewarding. If people are raiding 8-16 hours/week, or even more, they want to feel rewarded. That's why we see large gear upgrades in raids over the course of an expansion, and also why new characters going into a new expansion see massive upgrades. I *love* getting to a new expansion on alts and seeing these massive upgrades, it makes leveling more fun and rewarding.<br />
<br />
Why would people want to spend 8-16 hours a week raiding for minor stat upgrades that don't really make all that big of a difference? The gear gaps are there because they are a large part of the game being fun, at the current ilvl, if we were only getting +10 main stat upgrades per piece of gear, it wouldn't even be noticeable with a full set of new tier gear. There would be no real reason to put tons of effort into raiding for most people, and many people would quit because their basically &quot;gear capped&quot; already. There are other MMOs out there, like GW2, that allow you to spend hours and hours doing dungeons and raids for virtually no stat difference in gear. The #1 complaint I see on GW2's forums is the fact there is nothing to do because there's no gear worth getting.</div></div><hr />

DON'T post that kind of info. You only just posted the translation the other day and people were quick to run to GC with it like it was fact.

That is true, if they use smarter math in the back end the front end can easily display it with little to no change in computing power. I personally am indifferent. I don't care what they do in the end, because my character is still going to be the same character I love and enjoy.

All the ratios can be brought closer together with the same exponential grow. They just have to stop using full percentages with their scaling.<br />
<br />
&quot;can&quot; is a powerful word. They surely can but it would make the game completely ridiculous at low levels and we would get the same problem after few more expansions. That's also one of the reasons they have to get rid of exponentiality. Currently lvl 1 crits for ~50, a lvl 90 with bis gear and raidbuffs are critting like 500k-1m+ depending on loads of things. Even if they made lvl1 base to 1 damage and crit 2 it would still get rather high on next expansion.<br />
<br />
<br />
Looks like YOU don't understand maths. Scaling down, with a multiplier, can't transform an exponential function into a linear one.<br />
<br />
I understand math just fine. Someone just needs to practise on reading. People keep on using &quot;scale&quot; when they are NOT going to scale it down. Item squish is not about dividing everything with xx multiplier. They are getting rid the exponentiality which isn't done by dividing. I would suggest reading the original thread http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/2541-The-Great-Item-Squish-%28or-Not%29-of-Pandaria again. Just to quote using Blizzards own example pictures.<br />

It's not a dividing downscale. GC also said they have tried downscaling and it felt really wrong. That's why giving buffs is the only way to &quot;fix&quot; raid soloing. It doesn't fix a plethora of other problems. There's no absolute right way to fix it or they would have done it already. No matter what it will be artificial and feel really awkward and the game will suffer because of it. As a programmer I do understand the need but what I'm saying is that it IS a serious problem that can't be easily solved.</div></div><hr />

Just because other people feel differently doesn't make them crybabies. Don't be so selfish. If doing 150k DPS or 10k DPS doesn't bother you, then why would you even bother posting about the item squish? If true, you obviously wouldn't care if it happened or not.</div></div><hr />

The worst that could happen is WoW goes free to play and gets a huge chunk of player base back, and with the amount of stuff they are developing for the online store there will be no shortage of income in the end.</div></div><hr />

Most of the people who would not like this change are casuals, which is the majority of the fanbase. They will be confused, hate the fact they feel nerfed, and quit. These players don't research the game, they just sign on and play when they can and don't like changes. The majority will not even know about this stuff until it has happened. If they go through with this, the subs will drop by a very large chunk. I would argue it'd probably be the biggest sub drop in WoW history. We'll just have to wait and see what happens?<br />
<br />
If WoW goes F2P, it will turn into a microtransaction game and ultimately cost more to play than it does now if you wish to stay competitive. You'll end up having to buy character slots, bank space, consumables, etc. Then if it's really bad they'll add buffs items, dungeons, raids, quests, and other types of P2W items to the store like many F2P MMOs have.</div></div><hr />

No F2P would not ruin the game or cost more you still have to PAY FOR THE GAME, that is one thing that boggles my mind when people try to take it there. You pay for the battle chest and all the previous expansions beyond the chest plus the current ones, that's like 80$ going to Blizzard right there. Then on top of that they have all the vanity shit that a lot of people already buy, then xp, justice, and valor boosts. They would not ruin the game and they can still keep it to where progression is still necessary to have the best of the best shit.

It really does tho. The damage you do only matters in relation to how much health the mobs and bosses have. You can hit for 300k dps but if the bosses have 80 billion health, you are going to look weak as shit. Crying is exactly what you are doing because the reality is the strength of the characters will still be progressing in relation to the boss' healthpool.<br />
<br />
p.s. I hope for an item squish and when it doesn't happen because all of the complainers need to be carebeared, I will hope that blizzard makes the mobs healthpools insanely large to make you feel like weaksauce anyway. That's what I would do. Then you can see your 2 million crits flash on the screen and still have to fight for another 5 minutes to kill something. SO STRONG..SO PROGRESSED..

I am with you, it is funny how irrational people are about a random number. Has no one realized that when you level 1-60, your main attack spell almost constantly does the same amount of damage vs the mobs in the zone you are fighting. You kill a boar in westall, your icebolt does 28% of the boars health. you kill a boar in Blasted lands, your icebolt does 28% of the health of the boar. How does not ´make you feel less powerful´..<br />
<br />
This is definitely one of those times where GC is listening too much to the vocal crybabies who don´t understand what they are even crying about. Yeah, it will feel ackward for about the first 1 day after the switch.. then it will feel normal again. I mean, i am at the point now where bosses health make absolutely no sense, especially in cases where it is inflated due to certain mechanisms.... everything comes down to %´s anyway.. the absolute numbers don´t matter. If I told you we wiped when Mags was at 81,000,332 health, most people would not even be able to tell if we were close or not. Everyone uses %s anyway, and in the case of dps and recount.. it is all relative to other classes. If I did 80,000 dps on a boss, nobody knows crap unless I follow that up by complainign about being last, or bottom half or whatever.<br />

No, casual players will shoot three icebolts at a boar and watch it die, same as always. You do not feel nerfed because of the numbers that fly up, you feel nerfed if suddenly you had to cast 5 icebolts for a boar to die. The people crying are the people with recount installed, who like to brag about thier 1M crits every 5 mins over vent.<br />

<br />
what boggles my mind is the people who do not even know the basics of the game, yet talk about it. All of the old expansions are included in the original battlechest. You do not have to buy old expansions separate, and it is very easy to buy the battlechest for $5.<br />
<br />
But the biggest question about F2P is ´why?´ If people could read finiancial statements they would realize that revenues are great. The lost subscribers were almost all the very cheap ones fro China. WOW is earning as much money now as it ever has. So... WHY would the devs spend months of dev time breaking up the game to make it ready for f2p.. WHY? would blizzard mess with it´s cash cow and risk losing that 1B per year? You are wasting a lot of dev time, and risking a huge cash cow to go f2p which has very limited upside.<br />
<br />
And finally. SWTOR, AOC, EQ2, LOTRO... EVERY major game that died as a subscription model is also dying as free2play. Free2play is not some magic bullet. In fact. DDO online is the ONLY game that ever announced it was making more money after going f2p, and that is because it was the first AAA game to make the switch. SWTOR, EQ2 and AOC certainly haven´t magically recovered.<br />
<br />
People need to stop thinking of f2p as the ´modern´ way to go. No, it was a last grasp of breath for DDO, that worked, and then for a bunch of other games where it didn´t work. When EQ2 or SWTOR start announcing 1B per year in cashshop sales, then you can think it is right for WOW.<br />
<br />
Simply no way Blizzard is going to risk what they have now, even if they were making half as much as they have now. It is solid, stable money.. you simply don´t risk that for some crazy system that hasn´t worked for any other MMO except 1.<br />

I understand the idea of an item/stat squish but personally I don't see the need for it. If I crit for 500,000 or 50,000 why would most people find one more confusing than the other? Higher numbers are not more difficult to understand imo. What I do believe though is that seeing my numbers go DOWN because suddenly we have all been squished will feel very meh to a lot of people (myself included). Yes we would still have the same power in relation to mobs/bosses as we have now, and in most cases it probably will not make low level content harder to solo (some exceptions could be as you get to previous expac to current maybe), but it would still FEEL like we are less powerful. That to me would feel very disappointing. If it happens, then after a few months we probably wont feel that way anymore but I still don't want to have my characters go through a phase in their &quot;lives&quot; where they went though a strange world event whereby everyone/thing turned into a weakling.<br />
<br />
I think the reason for it is 2 things. First, it is a display issue. For combat logs, and on our screens, there is just too many numbers flying around and it is too fast. it makes it unreadable. the second is a performance issue... the more digits in a number, the more bits it requires.<br />
<br />
I agree with you about the brief adjustment phase, but I think people would get over it fast. In questing, you basically know how many spells kill a quest mob... the numbers aren´t that important.. if you miss, you know you will need another one, if you crit maybe one less.. but in most cases.. 5-7 spells kill a quest mob. In dungeons.. you are doing your rotation regardless.. and most people have bosses on %´s... the actual numbers are very unimportant except for epeen.</div></div><hr />

It makes the game feel rewarding. If people are raiding 8-16 hours/week, or even more, they want to feel rewarded. That's why we see large gear upgrades in raids over the course of an expansion, and also why new characters going into a new expansion see massive upgrades. I *love* getting to a new expansion on alts and seeing these massive upgrades, it makes leveling more fun and rewarding.<br />
<br />
Why would people want to spend 8-16 hours a week raiding for minor stat upgrades that don't really make all that big of a difference? The gear gaps are there because they are a large part of the game being fun, at the current ilvl, if we were only getting +10 main stat upgrades per piece of gear, it wouldn't even be noticeable with a full set of new tier gear. There would be no real reason to put tons of effort into raiding for most people, and many people would quit because their basically &quot;gear capped&quot; already. There are other MMOs out there, like GW2, that allow you to spend hours and hours doing dungeons and raids for virtually no stat difference in gear. The #1 complaint I see on GW2's forums is the fact there is nothing to do because there's no gear worth getting.<br />
<br />
I don't think you understand. This is to normalize previous gear and streamline the transition of old gear to current content. Raid gear will continue to increase in power at the same rate that it has in the past. You're not losing any power.<br />
<br />
You may like getting huge upgrades from one expansion to another but I feel that it makes the game much easier. I'm under powered if I don't take the new upgrades but I'm over powered with them. By normalizing the stats, we would be, well, normal powered.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I understand what this is doing perfectly, it's going to give 1-94 gear a linear gear curve, then a steep gear curve for level 95s. He was making it sound like he wanted ALL gear to be a very steady linear curve, which would result in an unrewarding raid experience. The values at 95 would still be a very small fraction of what they are now at level 90. We would go from getting 250-350k crits to 5k crits, and that is a power loss in my eyes. I don't care if it's relative or not. To me, it feels weaker and it is weaker, and it ruins my immersion and nostalgia from previous expansions. I totally get why some people don't have this mindset, but many of us do feel this way.<br />
<br />
As for solo content, it will definitely impact it. You are going from multiple steep curves, to a linear steady curve. The difference from a raid in classic and a raid in BC would be very small in terms of numbers. Our ilevels would be much closer to old content too, and that is why GC said in order to make it so we can still solo they'd give level 95 characters a stat buff when in old raids. This is a bad design and makes everything feel fake.<br />
<br />
I think i'm done discussing this for the time being though. It's either going to happen or not going to happen. If it does happen, I expect heavy sub loss especially from the casual community. Hopefully I am wrong. I'm still holding hope that they don't do it.</div></div><hr />

I've got this great new idea to make F1 racing safer. Make it a requirement for the teams to make cars that cannot go faster than 60MPH and shorten the tracks so the race still takes about the same length of time. It will make the race so much safer and because all the cars will have the same kind of limitation and the track so much shorter it will still be just as exciting I'm sure. Um....

Excellent example.<br />
<br />
I understand why some people don't feel that number size matters... but a good chunk fanbase does feel strongly about it. Most of the people pro-squish really don't care if it happens or not. On the other side, the anti-squish people feel like their game will be ruined and i've seen multiple comments the last fews day where people say they would quit when/if it happens. I've not seen anyone say they will quit if the squish doesn't happen.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I can't really comment about the &quot;too many numbers on the screen&quot; issue as I just don't personally find that an issue. Maybe some do, so ok. As for the number of bits required - sure it will take a few more ns to calculate how to update the screen on the client - similarly on the server. Overall I cant see it making more than about 0.01fps difference to gameplay. I CAN see it freeing up a few bytes of a very old game that has a lot of stuff very hard coded (remember how they had to remove the keyring to free up the bytes required for something else?) for them to utilise for something else so maybe that is a concern for them.<br />
<br />
I also personally think you are mistaken as to how quickly people will get over seeing themselves as nerfed. You are totally correct about general questing and just knowing how many attacks it takes to kill something and that's the important part.... However I know myself and from what others say to me that together with this I just like to see my character getting more powerful and this ISNT just down to how fast I can kill something. Imagine I can kill a strong tiger in 10 hits. Then someone nerfs me hard. At the same time they declaw the tiger so it cant damage me as much. Am I going to feel just as strong? No, I know I can maybe kill the tiger as fast but I know I can do this because it too is nerfed. We are both weaker and we know it. The actual numbers ARE unimportant theoretically, just like the colour quality of the items. It wouldnt MATTER if all items were suddenly white quality. Somehow I don't imagine many end game raiders would be particularly happy to be rewarded with white gear (however many people on here claim they wouldn't care - I personally do not believe that would be the real majority view). Perception is 9/10 of reality so the saying goes......</div></div><hr />

Seriously? First you tear into someone for voicing their opinions on the matter, then go on to make assumptions on behalf of &quot;the majority&quot; of the fanbase?

I have made MANY alts over the years and I can honestly tell you I do not at ALL thinking ANYTHING about the numbers I achieve in the first few levels of the game - its just a blur to get up to a higher level. The lower levels of the game now - after all these years - is no longer &quot;gameplay&quot; to me. I still enjoy it, but the enjoyment of levelling now is the challenge to myself to level as fast as I can. What I actually DO while leveling isnt any longer important to me.</div></div><hr />

You're pretty fucking whiny to be complaining about people whining.<br />
<br />
I think it's cute that you're whining about me whining. I also think it's adorable that you said &quot;You look like an idiot&quot; to the people saying you won't be able to solo old content. So you're calling ghostcrawler an idiot? Think on that for a second. Cause he said you won't be able to solo old content if they do the item squish. That's why he said they will add a buff when you enter old instances, genius. Think before you post so I don't have to waste my time explaining this dumb crap to you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
On the other hand, I don't think it's funny that people still don't understand what an item squish actually means. It's kinda sad. I count at least 10 such people in this thread so far.<br />
<br />
Such as this guy...<br />
<br />
<br />
rofl its funy to see that some ppl think the item squish is goin to buff old boses :P stupidity know no bounds :) whot do you think they ar goin to give as gear from tbc or whot ?? ehh<br />
<br />
You would think after all this time, people would understand what the item squish is. Toss in the people who know nothing about computers trying to explain how they work... pure gold.</div></div><hr />

I totally understand where the other side is coming from, but I truly feel it will be better overall for the game--especially for the next xpac. As it is already, I don't really &quot;feel&quot; or care about the difference between a 50k or 70k hit much less 350k-500k+. It all just looks like a huge jumble of number strings. It's also strange to see such vast amounts of primary/secondary stats now, in the sense that we're talking 5 digit stats on a single piece of gear @ L95. Overall it just feels like we've reached the point of absurdity.<br />
<br />
Keep in mind this is coming from someone that has played the game for a very long time, and practically skipped 75% of Cata. It makes the difference feel even larger. I remember the first time ever that I hit for over 1k in MC. I just stopped playing for ~30s and sat there amazed. I never had that feeling @ 2k, 10k, 35k, or 50k, etc....<br />
<br />
Just sharing my opinion. These comments are in no way intended to be hostile to the group that is against the squish. I value all informed opinions. We can still be friends :)</div></div><hr />

Its Blizzard's fault for adding so many tiers and demi-tiers to expansions, and the players' fault for constantly demanding more and whining when there's not a big enough gear jump between expansions.<br />
<br />
Blizzard are fixing the problem. <br />
<br />
Players will not suffer for it in the slightest. You'll suffer as much as losing 90% of your wages when all items become 90% cheaper - i.e. not in the slightest.</div></div><hr />

Well as a casual player you can take that assumption and stick it up your ass. In no way to I want someone with your questionable reasoning skills speaking on my behalf. <br />
<br />
As for myself, I really don't care about the squish as long as they are committed to keeping the old raids soloable, which as of right now it appears they are.<br />
<br />
Don't think I ever teared into anyone for voicing their opinion, I've been mature with all my posts. You on the other hand are telling me to stick something up my ass for voicing my opinions. Very ironic.<br />
<br />
Let me quote myself:<br />
&quot;Most of the people who would not like this change are casuals, which is the majority of the fanbase.&quot;<br />
<br />
No where did I state all casuals would not like this change. I said most of the people who would not like it are casuals with the logic that most casuals do not like changes. In no way shape or form does that mean all casuals or even majority of casuals. Don't put words in my mouth, thanks.<br />

<br />
Well, you would think so.. but you guys still seem to think a % based item level scale down is possible and it won't affect soloability. If this was true, then why did GC tweet that max level characters in old raids would be given +% stat buff so they can still solo? It's because it's not possible to do without a lot of tweaking, math, and man hours which they simply won't do. If we are required use a passive buff everytime we go into old raids in order to be able to solo.. then it did infact affect soloability. They just threw on a really bad bandaid to fix it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It wasn´t the devs fault the numbers got out of control (except maybe in the middle of WOTLK). It is just the product of a game that is 8 years old and has 4 expansions and a game that is set up with ´raid tiers´. The game is set up to have raid tiers, and it has had a lot of expansions, and the final part, and the devs are correct for doing this.. each tier´s gear MUST be noticeably stronger than the last tier. All of those correct decisions have led to this problem, but none of those things were a mistake in themselves.<br />
<br />
I really laugh at your use of the word ´suffer´.. is seeing 821 flash above the bosses name really suffering compared to seeing 105,380. do you need medication to ease the suffering you will feel. I seriously think people believe that their characters will be less powerful.. they will not. Bosses will still die in the same amount of time, quest mobs will still die in the same amount of spell casts.. nothing will change except the appearance of the numbers on your screen and in your combat logs.<br />
<br />
Maybe the solution is for the devs to commission an ´add-on´ that multiplies their new ´squished´ numbers to be 1,340,502,304,234 so all these ´suffering´ players can feel powerful again. You can all take screenshots and send them amongst yourself.</div></div><hr />

It's not as simple as running a % based number reduction across the game like many people seem to think. If you read the tweets by GC, he already said how they plan on doing it. They are just going to give buffs to higher level people in old raids, which is a rather terrible concept in my eyes. https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362453330179534850<br />
<br />
They keep making the game feel faker and faker, there's no surprise they keep losing subs. I don't want my character to be stronger in some areas, than weaker in others. This change will be the biggest sub loss for them, I am certain. They just can't seem to grasp that their main player base, casuals, do not want major changes.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
What about the players that have been playing since launch, and keep playing for bigger numbers and the sense of getting stronger. A large chunk of the player base thinks this way and plays for personal character development. Now they go from doing big numbers to tiny numbers, and feel weaker. You cannot tell me that if they did something like this in Diablo 3 that the entire player base wouldn't freak out. Lots of players use numbers as a sense of strength, by lower these you piss off a lot of the fanbase.<br />
<br />
There is nothing stopping people from upgrading their low end PCs. It's in the terms that the games requirements will raise overtime and it is up to the user to upgrade their computer. Big numbers play a very small part in the overall performance of the game, and would only make a large difference on people with very cheap and very old computers. Computers that should of been upgraded years ago. Why should the entire playerbase have to deal with a number squish because John wants to play on his $150 e-machine that he bought 8 years ago? <br />
<br />
The argument goes both ways, by doing the number squish you will piss off a lot of people that have the &quot;bigger numbers&quot; mentality. This is a LARGE chunk of the player base. By not doing the number squish, you piss off the people who refuse to upgrade their incredibly out dated systems, or want to play on higher settings than they should be. The people who have the argument &quot;I'm tired of seeing giant numbers&quot; can be resolved with addons or a future patch that condenses numbers into better formatting, such as 100K, 100M, 100B, etc.<br />
<br />
If you or anyone else playing WoW are against the item squish just because &quot; Dah, Big numbers man&quot; you're retarded.<br />
<br />
Who cares about the &quot;casuals&quot;. They're the reason the games gone down hill since the end of LK. Funny how the easier the game got the more subs WoW lost huh? The harder WoW was Vanilla - BC up to LK, we had the most subs and it was rising.<br />
<br />
If you're so dumb that you can't grasp the concept that you will still be the same in power as you are now with lower numbers, than by all means quit the game.<br />

I'm sorry, but it doesn't make someone &quot;retarded&quot; because they have a different view than you do.<br />
<br />
As I have quoted before (not going to bother finding the quote again now) even GC said that when they did try the squish it &quot;felt wrong&quot;. <br />
<br />
As for casuals..... it was how LK was that made more and more casual players enter the game, they didn't join &quot;since the end of LK&quot; and as for &quot;who cares&quot; about them.... well Blizzard do for a start as they represent by far the larger amount of the player base.<br />
<br />
I'm sure there are some people that cannot grasp that they will do the same representative damage as they do now, but mostly people against it are not complaining that they will BE nerfed (as in be harder to kill something), but that they will FEEL nerfed. Why is it that you are unable to grasp that?<br />
<br />
One day you may discover that it doesn't make someone &quot;retarded&quot; because they feel differently to you.</div></div><hr />

You're one of the people that don't understand it at all and shouldn't be calling other people clueless. Your scenario is only true in one very specific circumstance: player power against a same level mob, e.g. level 60 vs Ragnaros (MC) or level 80 vs Lich King (ICC).

It makes the game feel rewarding. If people are raiding 8-16 hours/week, or even more, they want to feel rewarded. That's why we see large gear upgrades in raids over the course of an expansion, and also why new characters going into a new expansion see massive upgrades. I *love* getting to a new expansion on alts and seeing these massive upgrades, it makes leveling more fun and rewarding.<br />
<br />
Why would people want to spend 8-16 hours a week raiding for minor stat upgrades that don't really make all that big of a difference? The gear gaps are there because they are a large part of the game being fun, at the current ilvl, if we were only getting +10 main stat upgrades per piece of gear, it wouldn't even be noticeable with a full set of new tier gear. There would be no real reason to put tons of effort into raiding for most people, and many people would quit because their basically &quot;gear capped&quot; already. There are other MMOs out there, like GW2, that allow you to spend hours and hours doing dungeons and raids for virtually no stat difference in gear. The #1 complaint I see on GW2's forums is the fact there is nothing to do because there's no gear worth getting.<br />
<br />
Exactly my point. When I got my item level 600 cloak, I marveled at how it had huge amounts of my primary stats (not to mention a good chunk of secondary stats). That was a massive, 86-item-level upgrade for me. We all know how much RNG is involved in obtaining said item; what would be the point if we're all scaled back to piddly numbers and stat gains? The huge jump in stats is a great motivator for people to stick with challenges/time sinks like the Wrathion quest line.</div></div><hr />

Players will not suffer for it in the slightest. You'll suffer as much as losing 90% of your wages when all items become 90% cheaper - i.e. not in the slightest.<br />
<br />
Yes, you just forgot the part where you go to visit your neighbor country (old expansion content) only to notice that they only reduced everything by 80% so you actually lost buying power when compared to other countries(expansions). All is fine and dandy if you stay in your own country(current expansion). Too bad many of us like to travel. Global world, eh?<br />
<br />
Technically it was Blizzard's fault but I think it was unintentional. They were shortsighted when they planned things in the earlier parts of wow. Didn't really think wow would go on so long. Add in extra tiers they didn't plan for and you have a problem arising. They aren't there for nothing. I'm sure they saw it forming long ago but the devs chose to use the practice used by politicians; bury their heads in sand. Out of sight, out of mind and hoped they wouldn't be there when things start hitting the fan and someone has to fix it. Ilvl jumps were and are needed tho.</div></div><hr />

Anyone else remember freezing, 0 fps for a couple seconds, on your first couple Sha of Anger or Galleon pulls ever?

Tune down graphics? seriously don't u realize what causes the freeze? its damn frame rate! bcz with the fight going on and with all kinda animation from players, mobs, boss and environment, ur graphics card is just bent on its knee. its no numbers that's making the freeze, its the graphics!<br />

You have to realize they are working with a 12 year old game engine that they cannot rebuild because it would alienate a lot of the player base that still use low end pc's, so the item crunch is the only way.<br />
<br />
My low end old PC could handle the numbers just fine, it was not my Processor crying because i was hitting for 100k, it was my graphics card crying when i attempted for Sha kill. will all things going on, the frame rate crawled down to like 5. U want the game playable on low end PC? ask for graphics squish, not numbers u r hitting for.<br />

I think the reason for it is 2 things. First, it is a display issue. For combat logs, and on our screens, there is just too many numbers flying around and it is too fast. it makes it unreadable. the second is a performance issue... the more digits in a number, the more bits it requires.<br />
<br />
I agree with you about the brief adjustment phase, but I think people would get over it fast. In questing, you basically know how many spells kill a quest mob... the numbers aren´t that important.. if you miss, you know you will need another one, if you crit maybe one less.. but in most cases.. 5-7 spells kill a quest mob. In dungeons.. you are doing your rotation regardless.. and most people have bosses on %´s... the actual numbers are very unimportant except for epeen.<br />
<br />
With all ur rationality, u fail to understand that the same bytes need to be allocated for numbers within the capacity of datatypes. and for ur record systems r far more capable for worrying about &quot;bit assignment&quot;. too many number flying around? stop the combat floating text or MSBT, recount/skada already show u nicely formatted numbers to analyze. there u go. Its all what u think. <br />
<br />
And to be honest, if we will be doing relatively same damage and all the shit. here comes the question, why bother the change anyway? oh wait &quot;big numbers scares me! i can't sleep at night! squish them! squish them hard!&quot;<br />

If you or anyone else playing WoW are against the item squish just because &quot; Dah, Big numbers man&quot; you're retarded.<br />
<br />
Who cares about the &quot;casuals&quot;. They're the reason the games gone down hill since the end of LK. Funny how the easier the game got the more subs WoW lost huh? The harder WoW was Vanilla - BC up to LK, we had the most subs and it was rising.<br />
<br />
If you're so dumb that you can't grasp the concept that you will still be the same in power as you are now with lower numbers, than by all means quit the game.<br />
<br />
Tired of seeing retards crying about their &quot;big numbers&quot;.<br />
