The quest chain that continues Saurfang's story is available in Patch 8.1. Spoilers ahead!<br />
<br />
<br />
The Dark Lady Calls and The High Overlord - Dark Ranger Alina on the docks of Dazar'alor has you go see Sylvanas in Orgrimmar. She sends you to Elwynn Forest to meet with one of her rangers as reports have surfaced that Saurfang has escaped custody.<br />
A Way Out, On Track, and Eastern Escape - You meet Dark Ranger Lyana outside Stormwind and investigate the area for signs of where Saurfang went. Following tracks and a recently used lock points to an escape through the sewer.<br />
Corner Crossing, Signs of Saurfang, Ever Eastward, and Tracking Tipoff - The search leads you to Redridge Mountain where you disguise yourselves as humans and question the local guards and townsfolk. After taking out a giant spider that Saurfang had injured, you question Hunter Mcalister, but kill him when his dogs identify you.<br />
Grim Tidings, A Warrior's Death, and Queen's Favor - Lyana leaves to report to Sylvanas and Zekhan appears, revealing that Saurfang is hiding in the Swamp of Sorrows. You arrive as the Dark Rangers prepare to capture or kill him and help defend Saurfang. Afterwards, he wants you and Zekhan to remain in the Warchief's favor and bruises you as a ploy to convince her that you didn't help. He then runs off after saying you will see him again. You return to Sylvanas who is irritated, but insists he will be found.<br />
Completing this quest chain rewards you with Worn Cloak (https://ptr.wowdb.com/items/165791-worn-cloak).<br />

<br />
<br />
Alternative Choice<br />
When you reach the point in the quest chain where you talk to Zekhan, you can choose to side with Sylvanas instead of continuing the quest and helping Saurfang. If you choose this, several things happen:<br />
<br />
<br />
You receive the quest For the Queen and head straight to Sylvanas instead of continuing the quest and helping Saurfang.<br />
A message tells you that you will not receive the Worn Cloak (https://ptr.wowdb.com/items/165791-worn-cloak), will start an alternate quest, and Zekhan will remember your choice.<br />

<br />
Yep, this is my interpretation. Without Blizz being straightforward that this &quot;vote&quot; means anything, you're just giving up a toy. I would side with Sylvanas but I'm still trying to earn that mount reward for 300 toys! Not exactly an even choice.</div></div><hr />

This conflict will have a resolution. Either Saurfang will win and Sylvanas will die, leaving all of the people who choose not to betray her feeling left out, or Sylvanas will win and Saurfang will die, leaving all of the people who choose to stand with him feeling left out. There is no possible storyline where the Horde moves forward with both groups satisfied.<br />

Great that they added it, but pointless ultimately. The story will move on without one of these groups one way or the other.

I do not think it will be that black and white. There are many options for blizzard. Here is a crazy Idea Sylvanas becomes the Lich queen and creates a third faction of Undead with undead versions of all the races. I know its a pipe dream but sure would vitalize the war. Horde vs Alliance is stale.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wow, split the playerbase further, I'm sure that will go over well*.<br />
<br />
*Destroy one faction while leaving one decent sized faction (Alliance) and two dead factions (Horde and Undead) picking over the remains of a once-great faction, leaving tons of players angry and with no substantial benefit to the game whatsoever.<br />
<br />
And that doesn't even get into the technicalities of it. What would happen to Undead on the Horde? They'd have to be moved to the new faction, but not all Undead would want to leave. Making it a choice makes the choice a no-brainer - DON'T go to the new faction with no one on it, stay on the one with an actual future since people already play on it. What would happen to people who already completed the entire level up from 1-120 as Horde? Would new leveling areas for Undead be created on a yet-unexplored continent to level from 1-120, or would they just 'effectively' be Horde until high level? Would Undead mounts be removed from the Horde? They aren't a Horde faction anymore, they should be Undead-only mounts. (Thus taking many mounts away from the Horde, making achievements harder to achieve.)<br />
<br />
This is a mess waiting to happen if they actually plan this. But then again, I've been saying this since they revealed the story for BfA - So I couldn't actually be surprised if it happens that way at all, and they'll pretend they just 'didn't see it coming' until it was too late.</div></div><hr />

Maybe, just maybe this is their way off loosening up the faction divide. Make it so all factions can play together. Heck pvp has been like that for a long time now with ashran.</div></div><hr />

Their way of doing it is introducing more factions, making people even more split up and contributing further to the problem?<br />
<br />
Or their way of doing it is making factions entirely irrelevant, thus, making a third faction even less needed since at that point, NO faction will mean anything?

Seems you have a feeble understanding. Lorewise they are split gameplay wise it does not matter what faction you are. Just look at pvp. Before we had Ashran where horde players could join the alliance and vice versa and in 8.1 horde players can join the alliance in Warmode and vice versa.</div></div><hr />

<br />
*Destroy one faction while leaving one decent sized faction (Alliance) and two dead factions (Horde and Undead) picking over the remains of a once-great faction, leaving tons of players angry and with no substantial benefit to the game whatsoever.<br />
<br />
And that doesn't even get into the technicalities of it. What would happen to Undead on the Horde? They'd have to be moved to the new faction, but not all Undead would want to leave. Making it a choice makes the choice a no-brainer - DON'T go to the new faction with no one on it, stay on the one with an actual future since people already play on it. What would happen to people who already completed the entire level up from 1-120 as Horde? Would new leveling areas for Undead be created on a yet-unexplored continent to level from 1-120, or would they just 'effectively' be Horde until high level? Would Undead mounts be removed from the Horde? They aren't a Horde faction anymore, they should be Undead-only mounts. (Thus taking many mounts away from the Horde, making achievements harder to achieve.)<br />
<br />
This is a mess waiting to happen if they actually plan this. But then again, I've been saying this since they revealed the story for BfA - So I couldn't actually be surprised if it happens that way at all, and they'll pretend they just 'didn't see it coming' until it was too late.<br />
<br />
One thing I think could happen here is that the Undead who side with Sylvanas remain the original Undead and in the Horde. The ones who side with Saurfang could be the Light Forsaken or Holy Forsaken or some such and be Alliance with their leader being Calia Menethil. I'm not sure how the leveling would work but I can see the leveling remaining the same until at some point a choice has to be made for new Forsaken characters.<br />
<br />
With the Dark Iron Dwarves being referenced on the cloak makes me wonder if there will some similar questline on the Alliance side where the Dark Iron Dwarves get to choose whether to be Alliance or go to the Horde as Darker Iron Dwarves or some such.<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
In order for Sylvanas to die we will have to kill her Valkyr first. What if we kill them and leave Sylvanas alive with the threat that if she doesn't behave she will die and it will be the final death for her. Not sure if she would remain the leader of the Forsaken, but someone else would take over as Warchief.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So why introduce a third faction if, gameplay-wise, they aren't different? What benefit does that bring the playerbase?<br />
<br />
Seems more sensible to just NOT have factions game-play wise. Which still brings the obvious question: Why did everyone just suddenly forgive Sylvanas and let her go without question? Why is she allowed to lead a faction, knowing full well what happened last time she was left in charge of a faction? Why is everyone not still hunting her down as they currently are?<br />

Not sure if she would remain the leader of the Forsaken, but someone else would take over as Warchief.<br />
<br />
Pretty sure:<br />
<br />
A) That would be entirely unsatisfying to anyone who has been hurt by Sylvanas,<br />
B) No one would accept that end, Sylvanas lover or hater,<br />
C) No one would accept those who stood together with Sylvanas back to the Horde,<br />
D) Wouldn't work, because there is no 'pick a side' moment for Undead. They were all raised by Sylvanas, they all serve Sylvanas. The 'holy undead' would be raised by another means, and would need to exist in a different zone entirely - Like all other Allied Races.<br />
E) If you take away Sylvanas' Valkyr, the only undead that CAN continue to be made are the 'holy undead' raised by Naaru.<br />
<br />
No one is going to accept anything but final death for Sylvanas at this point as a punishment. I mean hell, Anduin already tried the &quot;We have you backed into a corner, there's nowhere to run&quot; angle and nearly got himself and several leaders of the Alliance suicide bombed in the process - I'm pretty sure if it means total victory, Sylvanas WILL sacrifice herself. We've seen one single change in her character since she took the mantle of Warchief - She is no longer afraid to stand in direct opposition to anyone else. If she was so afraid of death, why is she making herself such a target?<br />
<br />
She wants people to hunt and plan to kill her, that's all we know.<br />
<br />
Aside: Wrongful tags appear on items in PTR all the time. I wouldn't read too much into the &quot;Dark Iron&quot; tag on the cloak until we know for sure the Alliance can do the quests. ESPECIALLY given that it's ONLY Dark Iron that is out of place on the cloak, I'd make a guess it was an accident, as Dark Iron Dwarf is the first alphabetical in the Alliance. (Dark Iron, Draenei, Dwarf, Gnome, etc. etc.)</div></div><hr />

Biggest problem is, that we already had all of that in MoP. Then, we all promised together with Vol'jin that the Horde would be different. And now we have no option to prevent Sylvanas to make the Horde even worse than under Garrosh, besides siding with a traitor to stage just another rebellion.<br />
<br />
This is stupid beyond redemption.<br />
<br />
At that point, I don't even want to be a part of the Horde anymore, but join Khadgar wherever he is. Or get back to my Class Hall and forget that this expansion even existed. <br />

Or follow Sylvanas to the bitter end. We had a rebellion, it was a failure. We probably shoudl now try the other way.<br />

It's great that we're finally getting choices. Though personally I won't be doing this quest. I'm not interested in serving either Saurfang and his Alliance puppet masters or Sylvanas. I wish they'd kept the third option in-game so I could say screw it to both of them.<br />

The Horde was basically the side-faction for the Alliance in Legion though. Other than some Horde stuff in Stormheim, it has mostly been us accompanying Alliance characters like Velen, Magni, Malfurion, Tyrande, Khadgar and Illidan (not entirely Alliance but they are for the most part), Maiev, Turalyon and Alleria. Not to mention all the screentime that Varian, Anduin and Genn has gotten. The Horde got nearly 0 development if it wasn't for Sylvanas and Nathanos in Stormheim. Its about time that they pick up the Horde stuff.</div></div><hr />

Pretty sure the said &quot;Warchief&quot; is going to be redeemed somehow by the &quot;evil knaifu&quot; situation that'll made her to do those horrible acts.... <br />

Then again, doesn't forgive the fact that she killed Liam and plagued Gilneas without it. (But that's my Alliance point-of-view)<br />

I like deciding in the moment without knowing what it will mean for the future. I like this! Blizzard, please create more of these permanent, defining situations! The choices we make will add depth and story telling unique to each character and player. Also will certain races from the horde and alliance end up leaving their faction and follow Sylvanas into the third faction? These path choices seem like a good way to introduce that idea.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't expect too much - I doubt they'll make you pick choices that have real, lasting consequences, like not being able to enter raids or other content, or get real rewards, or change the story overall. This isn't Fallout or Skyrim, where a choice early on changes the entire game - an MMO can't really do that, or Blizzard don't have the talent or leadership to pull that off.</div></div><hr />

Some really cool defining moments in games that have stuck with me are both actually in GTA 4 and 5 where you make an important decision that affects the rest of the game. E.g killing Playboy X or Dwayne, or Michael or Trevor etc.<br />
<br />
<br />
Choices are meaningful? You new? It's an illusion! It all leads to the same result. They only do it cause they don't want ppl bitching.. Any RPG in the last 20 years has more story choice than WoW.....it's a single line narrative don't get your hopes up cause you gotta slight difference of flavor.

1-60 remains slower than in 7.3.5. But 61-110 are all receiving a nerf and the exp required to level from 61-110 was never buffed in 7.3.5. So those levels will definitely be faster.</div></div><hr />

Character defining. Perhaps with each major choice, a direction of storytelling. I would certainly feel like my character is on a unique path of his own, even within the greater story and while still being a horde member. It would feel like he's is collecting his backstory with each decision he's making - and over time, I'd have this whole history of my own (my character's own). Even if it's just a handful of quests throughout, here and there. It might be hard to do but it's exciting to think that the game could go in that direction. It would be really refreshing and fun. It would offer a cool kind of progression, in that we'd have these personal histories and interesting consequences on how we handled certain situations - that set us apart from even our closest fellow horde members. A possibly needed role-play that sticks to our characters and really builds your character's story. Really exciting to think about, as I'm already excited about this quest and what it means for my character's future.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't ultimately see how this will change anything (the choices we make) unless they do some sort of end-game raid where if you sided with Saurfang you fight Sylvanas and watch the &quot;other&quot; raid fight Saurfang or you side with Sylvanas and fight Saurfang and watch the &quot;other&quot; raid fight Sylvanas. Much like they're doing with Alliance/Horde in this Siege of Zandalar raid. You still &quot;fight&quot; the same bosses but lore-wise you're watching the other faction fight them.<br />

The guy can't assume the consequences of his choices and actions, and when he does it's to break the horde, ok good job orc...<br />
<br />
It's what happened during the Second War too. When Gul'dan broke off and took like, a third of the Horde or something like that with him to hunt down the Tomb of Sargeras, Doomhammer then split the forces that were sieging Lordaeron to go after him. If he had just stuck to his objective and ignored Gul'dan bringing them 'dishonor' then they would've defeated Lordaeron and controlled nearly all of the Eastern Kingdoms, barring some holdouts like Ironforge.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This conflict will have a resolution. Either Saurfang will win and Sylvanas will die, leaving all of the people who choose not to betray her feeling left out, or Sylvanas will win and Saurfang will die, leaving all of the people who choose to stand with him feeling left out. There is no possible storyline where the Horde moves forward with both groups satisfied.<br />
<br />
Great that they added it, but pointless ultimately. The story will move on without one of these groups one way or the other. This patch would have been better served spelling out which side is the bad side for the Horde this time around, because ultimately we're going to end up being forced onto one side one way or the other.<br />
<br />
Or...Niether dies, Saurfang goes on to lead the Horde, and Sylvanas is redeemed, and goes on to start another faction, just as Tyrande starts another faction.<br />

Wow, split the playerbase further, I'm sure that will go over well*.<br />
<br />
*Destroy one faction while leaving one decent sized faction (Alliance) and two dead factions (Horde and Undead) picking over the remains of a once-great faction, leaving tons of players angry and with no substantial benefit to the game whatsoever.<br />
<br />
And that doesn't even get into the technicalities of it. What would happen to Undead on the Horde? They'd have to be moved to the new faction, but not all Undead would want to leave. Making it a choice makes the choice a no-brainer - DON'T go to the new faction with no one on it, stay on the one with an actual future since people already play on it. What would happen to people who already completed the entire level up from 1-120 as Horde? Would new leveling areas for Undead be created on a yet-unexplored continent to level from 1-120, or would they just 'effectively' be Horde until high level? Would Undead mounts be removed from the Horde? They aren't a Horde faction anymore, they should be Undead-only mounts. (Thus taking many mounts away from the Horde, making achievements harder to achieve.)<br />
<br />
This is a mess waiting to happen if they actually plan this. But then again, I've been saying this since they revealed the story for BfA - So I couldn't actually be surprised if it happens that way at all, and they'll pretend they just 'didn't see it coming' until it was too late.<br />

My theory is that it'll only be one faction in terms of gameplay, but in terms of lore it'll still be two factions. Basically, they'll remove language barriers, let people group, quest, and dungeon together, etc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And why, exactly, would anyone accept Sylvanas leading another faction that could potentially rival their own? Why would all three factions not then bring their might down upon whatever plan she has, knowing full well she'll just try again later? Anduin already has reason to believe Sylvanas is a threat to all, Saurfang would ABSOLUTELY view her as a problem seeing how dishonorable she nearly made the Horde, and Tyrande already has decided to take the fight to her - What could potentially make all three decide &quot;Y'know, maybe she ain't so bad after all&quot;?<br />
<br />
And your post STILL doesn't address the issues I brought up - What happens to the Undead on the Horde? Are they forced to the new, nearly-unpopulated faction and away from the groups they play with? Do both factions get Undead, and if so, how do they decide? (Sylvanas DEFINITELY would not ALLOW people to join the Horde, and she's the only one raising them, so...) The same problem exists for Night Elves and the Alliance. Would they level in the same zones, with the Undead as part of the Horde but not until they get to the new expansion? Would the mounts for that race be removed from their respective faction, making mount achievements harder for EVERYONE?<br />
<br />
And don't worry, I'll help wrench your head out of your ass for you - Sylvanas is irredeemable. There is no acceptable story where she lives and no one wants her dead.</div></div><hr />

A way out? As if you're not just going to be shoehorned into one way or the other anyway?<br />
<br />
This choice is meaningless. The story arc will have a resolution. Sylvanas isn't going to be let off the hook. They could pull some bullshit &quot;I was actually the only one who knew that this was the only way to save the world!&quot; story out of their ass and people would be PISSED STILL. She's murdered countless innocents. She isn't getting away, no matter her reasoning behind her actions, and no matter how bad killing her will leave us.<br />
<br />
There is no solution where Sylvanas doesn't die. So choosing to side with Sylvanas is kind of a silly choice - You'll be fighting alongside Saurfang one way or the other.</div></div><hr />

Just another proof. I will not betray Sylvanas even if they were rewarding an exclusive mount. Hang all the traitors with Saurfang at the front!<br />

Because their true plan, is to give people a reason to lvl up an alt :P (even if its only for a quest)<br />

Not that I think their opinion or choice is wrong or anything, but it really makes me feel like I don't belong on the horde faction any more. Just not a faction story I can really identify with.</div></div><hr />

I still rather follow her than the suicidal maniac that is saurfang. I mean for example any warrior player that picks saurfang i have to genuinely question if they gotten hit on their head one too many times since he already sent em to their death back in legion and were only lucky enough that odyn found em worthy to join him.</div></div><hr />

Didnt you play Dungeon keeper 2 ? It's good to be evil, I play a prideful elf who doesn't care about anything besides power (LOOTS) like all wow characters<br />
<br />
Sylvanas just killed ennemies of the horde, why is it bad ? We're doing it all day long<br />
<br />
Why should I betray my warchief and risk everything just to save an old orc when I'm already one of her &quot;champions&quot; ? for honor ? Doesn't make sense!</div></div><hr />

If Saurfangs honor would at least be reasonable and follow one narrative. But he randomly decides which things are honorable and which not on a whim. Like he is a schizophrenic maniac. We have to decide between 2 evils here.</div></div><hr />

you make no sense, she is a suicidal and maniac, if you don't member she already did once, she is dooming the horde</div></div><hr />

But she is the Warchief, and we must follow her, thats how an horde works, unless she privileges her own race over the others like Garrosh did, then we can.kick her out. But until now, she has done nothing wrong. Every single action of Sylvanas has been done to advance our faction goals since day one, (eliminating the alliance), and she has been a better Warchief than Thrall.<br />
<br />
The real problem here, is the big amount of sjw that do not understands whats is The Horde, and confuses real life political values with the azerothian ones, and well... the bad writting that caracterizes WOW since vanilla.</div></div><hr />

thats bullshit, the whole post, or you follow the warchief or you don't follow, if you are putting &quot;unless&quot; then the whole thing is not true in the first place, and you can use others unless every time you want, you do not decide what are the exceptions, and before the rebellion Garrosh never privileges his race over others, he always privileged loyalty, something the others barely had.<br />
<br />
nothing wrong? advance our faction goals? thats even more bullshit, she did wrong, she commit a genocide, she kill her own soldiers, she resurrect then as mindless zombies, she kill her forsaken loyalists because they had hope, she blackmail Baine, etc, she again, she don't give a flying fuck about the horde, she start a war in the worst moment when we were exhausted and without resources because the war against the legion, nothing for horde goals but her own goals alone, who we don't know about, she is just using the horde as meat shield and tools and would sacrifice it any day <br />
<br />
<br />

not really, the real problem are the edgelords undeads and elves fans who blindly follow their waifu, and think everyone who think different is just an alliance loyalist or peace lover<br />
<br />
if they understand what the horde is, they would not follow her, she is exactly against, what the horde stand for and was created since warcraft 3, not real horde political values, horde values</div></div><hr />

<br />
The horde exist as an political entity since Warcraft I, and the values of the horde created by Thrall (in year 20) dissapeared when he put Garrosh in charge (in year 28).<br />
<br />
8 Years of Thralls rule didnt created the horde, in fact, only weakened it, the Horde was created even before the crossing of the Dark Portal (compare 33+ years of history to 8). Being a sjw do not make you right, it makes you look ridiculous because trying to bring rl post-modern politics is what makes bad writing, and thats the principal problem with Warcraft these days.<br />
<br />
And your entire post is a sjw rant about modern values, genocide is a modern term, heck, the Romans are considered a great people and they wiped out entire cultures and civilizations to create their pax romana. With Sylvanas we are creating our own order, and after this war, if she wins, we will have true peace.<br />
<br />
But as you are a SJW, Blizzards writers are too. So we will have something like &quot;Azeroth is free!!11!&quot; at the end anyways. SJWs cannot into writing. Imagine Tolkien or Martin being sjws, lol, their books would suck.<br />
<br />
And im dont even a Sylvanas fan. I like the OLD HORDE, you know, burning Stormwind, dealing with demons, killing humans for fun, the old good stuff, before all this sjw nonsense. I do not want the horde being like the alliance, boring and plain, i want the Horde being the Horde, and Sylvanas have done a better work being a warchief that SORRY-FOR-BEING-AN-ORC-I-WILL-STARVE-MY-OWN-PEOPLE-THRALL, or the two clowns that came after him.</div></div><hr />

the horde created by thrall is another political entity<br />
<br />
<br />
8 Years of Thralls rule didnt created the horde,<br />
<br />
except it did<br />
<br />
<br />
in fact, only weakened it<br />
<br />
not rly, since this horde is way more sucesfull<br />
<br />
<br />
the Horde was created even before the crossing of the Dark Portal (compare 33+ years of history to 8).<br />
<br />
this was the first horde, 2 different things with the same name<br />
<br />
<br />
Being a sjw do not make you right, it makes you look ridiculous because trying to bring rl post-modern politics is what makes bad writing, and thats the principal problem with Warcraft these days.<br />
<br />
the heck is wrong with you and your fetish with sjw? nothing i talked about is sjw or post mordern politcs, are you even for real? im tallking about horde values, honor, loyalty, brotherhood, shamanism<br />
<br />
<br />
And your entire post is a sjw rant about modern values<br />
<br />
sure, cause, again, honor, loyalty, brotherhood, shamanism are post-mordern values, i can't even know if you are joking or being real here<br />
<br />
<br />
genocide is a modern term<br />
<br />
it is not, is used in wow many times, and its not well seing<br />
<br />
<br />
heck, the Romans are considered a great people and they wiped out entire cultures and civilizations to create their pax romana. <br />
<br />
but we are not roma, we are horde, we fight with honor, like always, we kill our enemies personally, enimes who can put a fight, we die in the battlefield with glory, not sitting around and plaguebombing everything.<br />
<br />
<br />
With Sylvanas we are creating our own order, and after this war, if she wins, we will have true peace.<br />
<br />
<br />
thats pure gold, creating our own order, maybe we can call 3.5th Reich, obiously she will not win, since by 8.1 we are losing in every font, and the only true peace was the pace of arthas want to give us, and i preffer him over a lame elf<br />
<br />
<br />
But as you are a SJW<br />
<br />
ayyyy<br />
<br />
<br />
And im dont even a Sylvanas fan. <br />
<br />
sure, i buy that :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
<br />
I like the OLD HORDE, <br />
<br />
no you don't, someone who like the old horde following and undead high elf? thats fucking hilarious<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
you know, burning Stormwind, dealing with demons, killing humans for fun, the old good stuff, before all this sjw nonsense. I do not want the horde being like the alliance, boring and plain, i want the Horde being the Horde, and Sylvanas have done a better work being a warchief that SORRY-FOR-BEING-AN-ORC-I-WILL-STARVE-MY-OWN-PEOPLE-THRALL, or the two clowns that came after him.<br />
<br />
newsflash: there are not just retarded warmongers genocidals and peace lovers options, Garrosh era was much better than this red-scourge you are praising, and he use the horde values, not sjw<br />
<br />
i think you have a complex, you just ignore every argument, every thing i say wrong about sylvanus, to do a spin and call me a sjw, bring arguments next time please</div></div><hr />
