It's called supply and demand. The value of the ticket isn't what they originally sell for. It's what people will pay to get them.</div></div><hr />

You have a limited time to insert your personal details. The person you buy your ticket from will just put in your own info and then email you the confirmation email and the printable ticket when they can.</div></div><hr />

Thats the thing, you only got 15minutes to do it, after that it kicks you for the next person :P<br />

So if people are buying huge amounts just to find out they cant resell them, we all get screwed due to people being jerks.</div></div><hr />

It's not the 15 minute thing, it's that they still give you a couple of months to change your information that's going to be on the ticket itself, so that's how they sell them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And nothing WILL be done, ever. They don't have the money to go to a further away convention center. They already lose loads on running Blizzcon, making absolutely no profit from it, and it would cost THOUSANDS more to move everything just a few more miles, let alone to a place like Las Vegas for example.<br />
<br />
Say about 20k people go, and subtracting cost of goodie bags and other small stuff what they get from each ticket is $100. They'd only get $2m, and far more than that would be spent on the concert, setting up the convention, security, using the convention center, and the time lost from having all their employees running Blizzcon (they have stated before they lose around 2-3 weeks from it).<br />
<br />
Edit: Miscalculation</div></div><hr />

Anaheim has one of the largest convention centers in the western US. Blizzard doesn't even use all the space there. Far from it. It's on Blizzard not wanting to pay more for space, not the convention center having space issues.</div></div><hr />

I AM GOING TO BLIZZCON!!!!!<br />
<br />
Finally, I have tried to buy tickets the last four events and always to far back in line ( i guess due to slow network speeds from comcast maybe???). Anyway I was at work and bought them on AT&amp;T network on my ipad. I started at 3800ish in line (closer to 3900 i think) and got my tix when there was 12% left.<br />
<br />
So fucking excited right now.<br />
<br />
BTW if anyone is in the vicinity of SW Michigan and would like to carpool there give me a shout. My choices are that, flying, train, or riding my bike there.<br />

Can't change your amount after you hit checkout like you use to be able to. I wanted 4 but ended up getting 1 =\<br />
<br />
Yes you could. I did, I immidiatly hit checkout upon refresh with 1 ticket and have 2 now. you just didn't look in the right place.</div></div><hr />

or just build a big ass place to do Blizzcon since they have the money for it... why not put every WoW player D3 player Sc2 player in one huge 5 stadium long place, and call it Blizzard Land with rides and cotton candy? xD would be epic<br />
<br />
They have that in China already</div></div><hr />

<br />
Most likely 30,000 total, 15k for each day. Remember people can buy up to 4 tickets. (Most people do. Some for friends / guildies, some to scalp, some as gifts, some for extra swag bags to eBay?)<br />
<br />
I got myself 4 tickets. My friends tried to get into the queue and he was 7,000 in place, so I grabbed his and his wife's. Gonna be fun! :D</div></div><hr />

I'm a little upset since I didn't realize I could add more to my cart after the queue but there's not much I can do now. Can't linger on it.<br />

It'll be my first Blizzcon and first actual vacation I've ever been on.</div></div><hr />

Why? This is a very common thing in everything out there. From new, hard to get items like consoles, games, to concert tickets etc. Plus it's perfectly legal to do. There are even legit sites that help you sell tickets for example. IE from Ticketmaster. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
We had 10 people in vent, aiming for 18 tickets. We got 20 tickets as a group and probably have the last 2 claimed. Some people only bought 1 or 2 tickets, could have gotten more.</div></div><hr />

Because it sucks when you're just trying to legitimately attend an event you like and want to go to but there are assholes out there who buy up a bunch of tickets in order to simply sell them for a profit. Not only does this rob genuine fans a chance of going at actual price, a lot of people consider it to be a dirty, under-handed way to go about 'business'.<br />

One of the years I spent hours on eBay flagging tickets and marking them for being sold above actual price. eBay used the banhammer and smashed a lot of them down.<br />
<br />
I'm personally just going to stay home and watch it online. Not only do you get to easily switch between streams and content, but you can watch everything for a WEEK after the event is over. It's a hell of a lot cheaper, more comfortable, and less of a hassle. Of course, it also means you can only order some of the swag online weeks after the fact, rather than taking it home.</div></div><hr />

The number is actually closer to 15k tickets. They usually sell around 30k.</div></div><hr />

Mind you I do find it strange, that I am in line at 10:00:01 PDT and I end up 9287 in line. Do hope they fix it so you can't really ebay them...I mean sure, you can sell them, but the buyer wont be able to use the ticket.<br />

<br />
You did what most people do... you forgot to add the stream revenue in there. That thing breaks records every single year, as they've mentioned in their quarterlies every single year since making that available. Further, the concert isn't that expensive and the venue is actually pretty reasonably priced.<br />
<br />
The employees that work it fall into two categories - developers and volunteers. Devs are quite well paid and this is part of their job description, as with any management job you plan for this event. Slides and panels aren't just phoned in. Other employees that attend pay a fee to go like anyone else. It's my understanding that the STAFF guys are volunteers. I dispute that, since it's California and labor laws are pretty strict, but it's something that I've heard from Blizz employees before.<br />
<br />
Whenever a company says they are taking a loss, my accountant side comes out. Even the first Batman movie reportedly never made a profit, it's all in how you book it and report it.<br />
<br />
I still can't believe the tickets are still this cheap, they really need to increase the prices.</div></div><hr />
