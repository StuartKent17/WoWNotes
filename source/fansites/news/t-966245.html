This patch doesn't really have anything interesting for players, it's mostly a bug fixes patch with a way to consolidate most of the Patch 4.2 hotfixes into the game files to display them properly.<br />

When's the Diablo 3 Beta?<br />
People keep asking when the D3 beta is, and it's pretty hard to give an actual date. Fansites have been contacted and asked to give contact info (battle.net accounts) for an access to the beta. <br />
<br />
The beta is definitely approaching and we probably won't have to wait much longer before we see something happen! As usual, keep an eye on Diablofans.com (http://diablofans.com/) for any D3 related update. <br />
We have begun early media and fansite outreach in preparation for the upcoming Diablo III beta test. The email they are receiving clearly states that we do not have a date to announce for the start of the beta test.<br />
<br />
While we appreciate the interest in the beta test, we’d like to take this opportunity to caution everyone of potential phishing attempts or scams. Emails from Blizzard Entertainment will NEVER ask you for your password, and if you are selected for participation in the beta test, you won’t need to click any links in any corresponding email that you’d receive from us. When the time comes, players accepted into the beta test will be able to sign in to their account at www.Battle.net and see a Diablo III Beta license as one of their game licenses, as well as the ability to download the beta.<br />
<br />
In order to be eligible to participate in the Diablo III beta test, you should set up a Beta Profile on your Battle.net account, by following these instructions: http://us.blizzard.com/support/article.xml?locale=en_US&amp;articleId=27087<br />
<br />
You'll want to stay tuned to the front page blogs of this community site for future announcements regarding the Diablo III beta test. <br />

There's this thing called Patch 4.3, and it hasn't even been put into patch notes. Do people really have zero ability to see past the most immediate thing presented to them? My god, remind me to stay off the roads when you folks be all drivin' and what not.</div></div><hr />

I have seen past 4.2.2 and thats why I'm saying there is no need to wait &quot;until christmas&quot;. You know only because there will be a patch 4.3 in the future doesn't mean blizzard is not allowed to put some class changes in 4.2.2. Think about it while you are on the road.</div></div><hr />

<br />
4.2.2 has been lingering for about 3 weeks now, and as far as I know, there are no real important changes at all. If they haven't touched a class in months, why would they suddenly start now? Apart from a few obvious exceptions, PvE dps balance is pretty good.</div></div><hr />

I think it has to do with the fact that Patch 4.3 is the Deathwing raid, the Big Bad of this expansion, and some people are more interested in an updated circus.</div></div><hr />

Uh, you do realize that 4.3 is predicted at the end of the year right? That would be nearly 6 months without class changes (counting the time it's been since the last major changes as well). You are insane if you think the player base can handle half a year without changes. It's unheard of even by WoW standards to wait that long.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is Cataclysm - a big evil dragon, Deathwing, is destroying Azeroth and everyone in it - think of the cataclysm trailer. thus the guy on fire in the comic... amidst this death and destruction, someone decides to build a circus with cute monkeys in hats, Darkmoon Faire. <br />
<br />
The comic is funny because it portrays how Deathwing's reign of fiery death and destruction and a revamped Darkmoon Faire don't fit the same theme.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You haven't played for very long have you? Class changes ONLY happened in big raid content patches...and back in the day not all classes got fixes even in these big patches. If Blizzard needed to put out class changes so drastically, they can hot fix things in, but if I had to judge I don't think that 4.2.2 needed class changes in it. Then again, Blizzard is in a catch 22 with class balance. If they did more frequently, people would bitch about a roller coaster ride in terms of balance, and if they do it too slow, they get folks such as yourself complaining. They can't placate everyone, so they go the route best for the GAME, not you personally.</div></div><hr />

Less then that will see Deathwing in 4.3. So Blizzard is creating content that the other 90% can see, and we all have to freak out? If the entire community isn't 100% focused on deathwing (again, which 90% won't even fight) then something is wrong?I understand the premise of the joke, but have to mimic many before me in that I don't understand the humor in it.Also, guess what high end progression guild do when forming up for a raid, or recovering from a wipe to deathwing? I dunno, break out novelty pets or costumes. I guess I forgot that we aren't allowed to have fun when 4.3 drops. We have to be all business then... cause it's Deathwing!Some of you that have a problem with the Darkmoon Faire or changing your armor look, etc, need to get a grip.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Um. It's basically September. That would be the 9th month out of 12. That means in order to launch it before Christmas, they have about 3 months. 3 months isn't too bad at all. 3 =/= 6. It would take the patch coming out in February to be half a year. See? It doesnt sound quite so bad when you arent rounding wildly up.</div></div><hr />

I wanna have non-raiding fun too and fully support Darkmoon Faire being implemented. :) Even so, the comic is funny because it holds some truth. The comic itself isn't saying it shouldn't be implemented - just pointing out the humor behind its timing.</div></div><hr />

They're mocking WoW,one moment you're fighting Ragnaros to save the world and the other you're enjoying the darkmoon fair.<br />

perhaps unique banter during it:<br />

Tremble, puny carnival folk! Make peace with the end of your little &quot;darkmoon faire&quot;, for the hour of twilight falls!</div></div><hr />

It's like... now that Deathwing has arrived, it's a perfect time to party!Not saying it's bad ^^ Only that the comic is making fun of how 4.3 is paradoxical.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Occasionally? I'd say never. I've never been a fan of any WoW comics but this is the worst. Hands down.</div></div><hr />

If you think about it....... JK that was quite literally the least funny thing anyone has ever created, except perhaps for this post.</div></div><hr />

And Seasoning, the monkey with the hat is in the faire, which is being given its own island in 4.3.</div></div><hr />
