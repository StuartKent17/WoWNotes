Legion Collector's Edition Mount - Illidari Felstalker<br />
The Illidari Felstalker (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/189998-illidari-felstalker) is the Legion Collector's Edition Mount. Keep in mind that while it is flagged as a flying mount, there are currently no specific flying animations, so it uses swimming animations. There is no official confirmation that it will be able to fly.<br />

Mercenary's Medallion of Adaptation has half the versatility of the other pvp trinkets, bug or intended?<br />

They'd likely have to build a new skeleton for the model if they did that. It's much easier to grab a skeleton and throw skin on top of it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The Ghost Wolf animations are the best wolf animations in game.<br />
This however has been pointed out several times and rarely ever has Blizzard shown interest in it.<br />
If it's anything like the classic mounts' update they did it will probably be a single rep mount from a world PVP vendor. Mark my words.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Re-skin&quot; means changing the skin - the texture only.</div></div><hr />

No, that is retexturing.<br />

Some just want shiny stuff they will forget about as soon as they hit play :P<br />
I love that its a felstalker (felhound) cool for lore fans (specifically The war of the Ancient trilogy which people should read if they haven't! It will explain a lot)<br />

I agree that it shouldn't fly ever cause that makes no sense (i know its not confirmed to fly yet) but i can also see people complaining (Like in wod) how they bought a mount they cant fly.</div></div><hr />

This however has been pointed out several times and rarely ever has Blizzard shown interest in it.<br />
If it's anything like the classic mounts' update they did it will probably be a single rep mount from a world PVP vendor. Mark my words.<br />
<br />
I don't play a Shaman and my experience with new wolf models is limited, but I looked up one of the models on wowhead. Oh my god, why can't that be every wolf, npc and mount? That run is MUCH better.</div></div><hr />

The skull of a hunted demon perhaps?<br />

After WoD with all the &quot;wolf&quot; mounts running like Azerothian Worgs (since devs couldn't be arsed to adapt our characters to a mount that runs like the WOLVES of this game do) they give us yet another mount that runs as if it has sever hip dysplasia??<br />
<br />

Good thing I buy the physical CE for the other stuff. At least this CE mount won't look horribly out of place during the grounded period of Legion.</div></div><hr />

You can fly with it in the old world so who cares about when they add flying into Legion, they still have to worry about the flying in the old world areas with the mount unless it is a riding mount until Legion flying is enabled.</div></div><hr />
