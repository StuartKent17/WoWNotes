The team was working on Warlords of Draenor before Mists of Pandaria was done. They have been trying to think about the next few expansions ahead of time to make the story fit together better. They already have a really good idea of what the next expansion will be about now.&quot;<br />

<br />
I wonder how the faster daily cooldown works, reducing the time to like 12 hours instead of 24 (if not less) sounds pretty annoying to me. Someone who can't be online multiple hours per day due to work/studying would have to log on again at the middle of the night, if having time at all. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
If you build a profession building that is for a profession you don't know, you will still be able to have the NPCs craft all but the best things from that profession.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sounds to me like there is pretty much no point to have any other building except the ones for the profession you already have then. Not sure what they classify as 'best', but if we couldn't craft flasks or gems it sounds pointless to me to have those.</div></div><hr />

another wasted potential...it would be nice to have &quot;5&quot; proffs on your char and would encourage people to focus on 1-2 characters instead of 5-6 alts...but then we need to sell alts so..yea, you can have the other prof buildings for what? for leveling green gear?</div></div><hr />

For some reason I imagine it's going to be more than green gear bud. Oh and by the way, if you don't want to manage 5-6 alts for professions you REALLY don't have to.</div></div><hr />

Guessing that instead of just having capital city portals and mage portals back, you'd have to do some stupidly long questline to unlock one or both first. Probably they also thought about resetting you're hearth when you went through to close that loophole.</div></div><hr />

I believe they previously mentioned that daily cooldowns in Warlords are on a charge system, letting you build up three or five cooldowns to use in a row before you actually start losing them.</div></div><hr />

Add that to this little gem - &quot;NPCs that invade your garrison can attack buildings or walls, kidnap followers, or do other things using a new AI system.&quot; and i really hate the concept of Garrisons so far.<br />
<br />
I really hope garrisons are not THAT big of a requirement to even play WoD. They were a desire of a certain percentage of players which i am not part of. This is a lame attempt to satisfy the player housing bunch while trying to convince the rest of us that it's not &quot;player housing&quot; or even a substitution for it.<br />
<br />
I'm not against them, i just don't really want them to be as essential to the expansion as they seem to be. I'm a single hero, i'm not a commander of an army.</div></div><hr />

forced forced forced... please stop crying about what you are forced to do... what is it you are forced to do ONE TIME? it is basically a quest.. one time.. you have to do a quest... one time.... you have to kill some mobs that are invading a quest area... one time....<br />

myself like the majority would rather not have to deal with it at all yes its forced on you where as it shouldn't have to have a garrison scenario forced on you to complete a zone that has nothing to do with invasions. <br />

<br />
You may as well just go GRIND MOBS to level to 100, because you're &quot;forced&quot; to do quests to level, huh? As with ANY zone, you're forced to do quests to lead to the next quests, having to do an invasion is absolutely no different and you would do it ANYWAY. You're leveling, it gives EXP, You're GOING to do it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Garrisons and invasions are no more forced than quests, dungeons and raids. Might as well stop doing it all together if &quot;forced&quot; content is what puts you off. And the invasion quests are not even forced, they are there as a side option.</div></div><hr />

You have no clue what the majority of people want. You aren't forced to do jack shit. One day when you grow up you'll find out that you are free to do (or not do) a lot of things. In this instance you are free to not participate in anything. If you tried to use what little grey matter you have you might actually start to think for yourself! It's liberating.</div></div><hr />

no because your not forced to do quests actually. as in they also gave pvp exp and many people actually level thru pvp oh and yes there's dungeons which once again give exp..... but in order to keep questing your forced to participate in the invasions losing potential followers. invasions are not oh look they are just throwing 400 mobs at us. its timed, there is waves, mini bosses and more slow downs then a old man driving on a freeway. so yes YOU ARE FORCED. Forced to do the invasion if you want to finish the zone and continue questing your forced in to their delusion of gimmicks of trying to make a sad game interesting instead of you know producing a half decent xpack where classes are completely screwed they focus their most of their attention on the gimmick of garrisons just like they did pokiwow.<br />

you Will Die that is definitely forced eh ? even in life you are forced in to things you don't want. That Doesn't make it fine to force things in video games.</div></div><hr />

Well you know one thing is ABSOLUTELY not forced on you....actually two things....1) you don't have to participate in WoD , since your comments make it seem like you are very displeased with the direction of it, and 2) you don't have to even keep playing WoW if blizzard's vision for their game sickens / upsets you.<br />
<br />
I'm certainly not going to stand in your way if you want leave. :)<br />

<br />
Welcome to 10 garrison farm :)... i start hating garrison so bad<br />
<br />
<br />
Some people keep making the farm comparison and yes its true blizzard themselves admitted the farm was the early testing ground for something like garrisons.<br />
<br />
But say the garrison is just a bigger farm is like saying a Ferrari is just another sports car. Their foundations may have similarities (being that say a Ford Mustang GT and a Ferrari are both cars....they both have engines, four wheels , etc. etc.) but when you delve further into them there's much more being offered in terms of performance and handling in the Ferrari than in a common Mustang GT. Just like the farm vs the garrison argument, the comparison ends with foundation and the phasing tech . The garrison offers *FAR* more than the farm..i hated the farm I thought it was stupid to be quite honest.<br />
<br />
But garrisons.....that look awesome (at least for alliance) .... and I get a host of benefits with it...including benefits of accessing professions my character doesn't even have? <br />
<br />
sign me up.<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
And they sell in game stuff for rl money Cms heroic gary kills you name it and blizzard knows and let it go on. WoW is pay to win period.<br />
<br />
Its not pay to win in the traditional sense....though I'll be honest and say I'm not so confident I can defend blizzard in the future based on the road they seem to be heading down with the advent of purchasable 90 level character boosts. right now any pay to win is not driven by official blizzard means...its the players themselves that are creating that &quot;pay to win service&quot; its not sanctioned or provided by blizzard. <br />
<br />
To say in counter to that &quot;well they aren't stopping it from happening now are they?&quot;.....I understand your frustration (I think the same - I personally think its lame that its getting so common place these days that people will sell you services to more or less play your character for you -- on stormrage they offer ROUTINE and DAILY....full carries of any high end raid content, just select/single boss kills, people sell profession kits, people sell specific achievements, people are even selling services that they will level your battle pets to lvl 25 for you...) but again that's the players not blizzard....what can blizzard really do to stop that? <br />
<br />
The only control they could do would be COMPLETELY revamp the entire monetary system and the rules for what currencies can be traded among players.<br />
<br />
Such a system would be more complicated and time consuming to implement than designing a whole expansion.<br />
<br />
So really what I'm saying is I agree with you, but don't take your anger out on blizzard....blame the famed wonderful &quot;wow community&quot; they are the ones doing it.<br />
<br />
Never mind how hypocritical all this is.....one message in gen chat hacks on people that don't have the ilvl or the achievement to join their &quot;HARDCORE LEGIT RAID&quot; (how its advertised in chat) .....<br />
<br />
But two lines down in the same chat some other guild is saying &quot;Buy your raid achieves here&quot; or &quot;Selling full carries -- HEROIC....get your ilvl up the easy way . we do all the work!&quot;.....<br />
<br />
I mean how can this go on and yet people still have the nards in blizzard forums to hack on people not being skilled raiders or geared or whatever? Does no one else see the hypocrisy but me on this issue?</div></div><hr />

While I was Ok with the farm for a bit, it got old really quickly. That said, this sounds like if you like messing with professions you are going to end up stuck messing with them, whether you want to or not. I really hate the idea of schematics being stuck behind achievements, something that I don't care one single thing about, and find more annoying than enjoyable.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So how did i get to 100 through questing without doing a single invasion quest? The new areas open up based on your lvl. Not based on what quests you have previously completed. Almost everything you are saying is flat out wrong ...</div></div><hr />

I think there will be some simple utility well beyond that of the farm. Even if you only added bsmith, bank, and auction house... Basically serves as your own little crowd free staging area for queues, repairs, and shopping. Dont need to worry about city lag, no annoying trade chat. Sure it might take a little questing to create that, but time was gonna be spent leveling anyway. Let the completionistas and min/maxers worry about upkeep and achievements.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh SHUT UP! <br />
<br />
It's one quest. ONE FUCKING QUEST. Those things you've been doing since level 1. You have to do one invasion to finish the quest line. STOP. WHINING. You're everything wrong with the WoW player base. Moan moan moan moan fucking moan, about the tinest of things, no matter how insignificant it is. You've gotta do one quest, why is that such a big fucking deal? It isn't. Not in the slightest. &quot;Oh well I'm part of the WoW playerbase so I'll make it a big deal because I have the patience and temper of a child and this game is so shit, but I still play and pay for it, because apparently paying for things you hate is a good use of money!&quot; <br />
<br />
Yeah, you do have to do it, the same as you're FORCED to level up to do stuff, FORCED to do one quest to do the next, you're FORCED to get gear to get better gear, FORCED to play a class that has a healing spec in order to heal.... blah blah blah blah blah fucking blah. Stop complaining!<br />
<br />
You're forced to do things in video games ALL the time. This big crime? A single quest. Oh I know, it's fucking awful isn't it? The terrible things Blizzard FORCES you to do. Gimme a break, stop being such self entitled whiner and suck it up.</div></div><hr />
