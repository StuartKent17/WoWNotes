<br />
<br />
I'd say its close now that Saurfang is on the list. I didnt think he would be tested. Arthas will NOT be tested on the PTR (think yogg-saron and algalon)<br />
<br />
Hopefully they will keep the Lore part of the Saurfang fight out of the testing, but since its mostly all available in the PTR files they prolly won't bother omitting it.</div></div><hr />

Two bosses, one day? So many delightful possibilities... or just a typo? ???</div></div><hr />

<br />
i think so!<br />
<br />
<br />
As far as my memory serves this about wraps up all the fights for testing sans arthas. I'm still holding on to a release the week before thanksgiving. makes a nice black friday/cyber-monday commercial no? come slay the lich king!<br />
<br />
guess we'll have a better idea once they start giving us chunks of patch to DL....</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
i think that's highly likely to be honest, blizz wouldn't want it to be ruined for all the people on the live servers, i think they did the same with yoggy and algalon, but i can't quite remember</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
It's no typo. They're probably tacking on bosses that have been thoroughly tested already to give them another pass for polish, or something to that effect.</div></div><hr />

Only the end boss shouldn't make it in.. Saurfang needs to be tested. You act like they can't take the lore stuff out of the ptr.</div></div><hr />

If this isn't the last build (which I highly doubt it will be) then that means we're now confirmed to be at least two more weeks away from the patch.<br />

I know that seems like an obvious statement, but I want 3.3 soooo badly. :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Easily that.<br />
<br />
The two sure signs IMO (from watching patch releases here for a while now) is #1 gear (2-3 weeks) and #2 the ever shrinking patch notes list (1-2 weeks) where it's down to 2-3 line notes on minor (usually non-class related) changes.<br />
<br />
Seeing as we haven't even seen a single item yet... I'm guessing 3+ weeks easy (Dec 8th or 15th are my best guesses - with the 15th being more likely)</div></div><hr />
