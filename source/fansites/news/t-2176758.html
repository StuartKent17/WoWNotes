PTR Development Notes - Build 23657<br />
This week, we’re still focused primarily on stability and raid testing, as well as finding as many bugs as possible, as we continue to make adjustments and tweaks to 7.2 content.<br />
<br />
You’ll see the return of Thaumaturge Vashreen to the Broken Shore, once again selling tokens that can be exchanged for gear. Those items still need a little work before they’re ready for testing, but we wanted to provide some extra context on what to expect from them:<br />
<br />
The Dauntless tokens are similar to the gear tokens that were available through the Timeless Isle or Tanaan Jungle in previous expansions, and have the same overall intent: as catch-up gear for alts or newer characters. For Legion, we’ve extended that general concept with the Relinquished tokens. These will always reward gear with a higher item level than the Dauntless tokens, and sometimes, you’ll receive a piece of dungeon, raid, or PvP gear instead. Our basic intent is for you to use these to shore up “weak spots” in your characters gear, but in rare circumstances, it can even give a Legendary for that slot, according to your loot specialization. That’ll be very uncommon, and the fastest/most reliable way to get a Legendary will still be through other content, but if there’s one in particular that you really want, buying these tokens might be a good use of your Nethershards.<br />
<br />
Note that the actual cost of these items hasn’t yet been determined, and their contents aren’t bug-free, but we hope to have them ready for testing in next week’s push.<br />
<br />
You may also notice that the line “May contain a Legendary item” has been removed from the tooltip for these tokens. This is only a tooltip change; their actual chance to grant a Legendary has not changed. This is more to avoid confusion than anything else, particularly for the sort of player who doesn’t keep up with the news on the forums or fansites. Realistically, these tokens can be nearly anything from the Broken Isles, so it seemed unnecessary to call out Legendaries specifically in the tooltip.<br />
<br />
Lastly, we’re planning to organize another Broken Shore stress test sometime in the coming few days, and looking into ways to make it a bit more exciting this time around. Keep an eye out for more details as soon as those plans are finalized.<br />
<br />
Happy testing!<br />
<br />

As always, this testing schedule is very fluid and subject to the realities of a PTR environment. We might have to change the time of a testing session, change the bosses being tested, or cancel a test entirely, due to bugs, server hardware issues, etc. Keep an eye on this forum for the latest information, and thank you in advance for testing and providing feedback.<br />

It's just disheartening to see nerf after nerf, every single patch, especially when you're not anywhere close to having BiS gear, which is where Guardian's scaling issues actually present themselves.

Oh boo hoo. Guardians might have to actually try put in some effort like every other tank spec and won't be able solo tank mythic Gul'Dan.<br />

I would also like to add that the Guardian nerfs have been extremely light compared to all the nerfs prot warriors have recieved.<br />

So again, cry me a river.<br />

Looks like I was right... they're trying to get fury warriors away from Inner Rage in 7.2 without actually nerfing the talent.<br />

They toned down the armor gain from a guardian trait by 4% which is not even on live, as far as I can tell... Massive sweeping nerfs there...<br />
<br />
Not like they took their main active mitigation ability and nerfed it by 33% in several different ways or anything. It would be insane for blizzard to do that.<br />

It never feels good being nerfed no matter how &quot;necessary&quot; it is. If the answer to the question of &quot;What tank is best on X boss?&quot; is Y class for every single boss, then that class whether it be Guardian or otherwise is unfortunately overpowered and either needs to be bought back into line or the others to be bumped up. Unfortunately for Guardian, and the other tanks that are struggling on certain Nighthold bosses Blizzard would rather bump Guardian down than bump the others up.<br />
<br />
I should note that I'm not saying the other classes cannot do the job, but it's clear to everyone that guardian is far too powerful in its current incarnation.</div></div><hr />

Literally the only thing getting &quot;nerfed&quot; in this update is the armor gain from an Artifact trait that isn't even live.<br />
<br />
Using the PTR to balance new abilities before they go live is now &quot;nerfing&quot;?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Of course, ptr not being final and all, and whom even knows how much it will effect guardian if/when it does go live. But as it stands currently the 4 percent of armor loss from the trait should it go live is a step in the right direction.</div></div><hr />

Bear in mind they did raid testing in Nighthold in Beta like a year before it came out :D<br />
<br />
Testing doesn't necessarily mean it's imminent for release.</div></div><hr />

nighthold had raid testing a long time before legion even launched, and we only finally got nighthold, just because ToS is being raid tested now, doesent mean it will come out within even the next 6 months</div></div><hr />

I remember doing Nighthold testing in Beta LONG before Legion came to live in August and Nighthold came out in January so what 6 or so months in advance?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yep. I can find videos on youtube from June with mythic raid testing from Beta so it was definitely a good, what, 7 months before Nighthold was even released?<br />
<br />
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qtr3TaxmyMo - First video I found searching on youtube, 20th Jun with Mythic Krosus.<br />
<br />
Obviously &quot;Like a year...&quot; was hyperbole. I didn't mean literally a year.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Keep in mind that Nighthold was in testing for about a year before it was released.<br />
<br />
Also keep in mind they've said ToS won't be open as soon as 7.2 drops. They've said there will be a lead up quest line similar to the Suramar one before it opens which was 9 weeks longs.<br />

I wouldn't care as much about them nerfing Guardian if I didn't have to break my fingers to stop other tanks from ripping threat off me on bosses.<br />
<br />
I'll care about Guardian threat issues when every other tank in the game can solo tank mythic gul'dan.</div></div><hr />

Now they notice that their bad gear scaling makes the Guardian stronger than intended. That's why they nerf its armor over and over again to prevent armor capping.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's not completely solo tanking.. If you mean taking the scythes solo like Sco did, he could only do that because of the legendary ring and trinket.. So that's not necessarily a problem because of the spec but more because of the legendaries.<br />
<br />
I do not believe guardian needs a nerf anymore, I think other tanks need a buff. Guardian is basically the only tank that actually tanks, aka prevents damage. Sure, I'm slightly biased, but I would like my BrM and DK to be good as well. :)</div></div><hr />
