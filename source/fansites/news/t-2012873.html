Very interested in what else they thought of instead, and I'm very happy to see that they're dropping the unrealistic &quot;1 xpac per year&quot; bullshit that just left us with a neutered expansion.<br />
<br />
My only complaint about the Bloods being BOP is that my main is an enchanter/scribe and I'll probably be regulated to fishing to earn them.

Eh, I would imagine an &quot;easy&quot; fix would be to use the animations of the transmog. I say easy in quotes because I have no idea how much coding would actually have to be done for this.

Honestly at that point, I think one animation would be worth sacrificing for a more personalized look for your toon. I just think they are being stubborn about transmogging to other weapon types. They'll budge eventually but it'll probably be a while.</div></div><hr />

You didn't have proper animations in that form, which is the reason they said they aren't doing it.<br />

I find it very hard to believe they can't make you swap animations based on appearance. After all there is code in place to swap animations when you change weapons, and all races have every animation ready to be used.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
The key is that the animations are for the model, they aren't based on the weapon really. So when you flip into Gamon, you're seeing Gamon's animations, not the axe's.<br />
<br />
So what they would have to do is create new animations for each class for all possible weapon types and then have which attack animation is used be based on the weapon equipped/xmog'd and which attack is being used in order to prevent stabbing with a mace type &quot;issues&quot;.</div></div><hr />

This makes it sound like I could level one spec's Artifact up and then acquire another spec's weapon (same class) and have the same level progression/points available on that weapon. Countering that understanding it says:<br />
<br />
<br />
If you focus on your primary weapon and are 20 traits in, you might have to choose if you want one trait in your main weapon or five in your off-spec weapon.<br />

Sums up my thoughts on that well.<br />
They are basically saying &quot;screw you, double gatherer's&quot;.<br />
Why should that not be an option.<br />
<br />
<br />
Maybe I'm not understanding Artifact Knowledge vs Artifact Power?<br />
<br />
From my understanding Artifact power is the actual progression.<br />
Artifact knowledge is a per-character buff, one that increases artifact power (potentially) from all its sources.<br />
The more traits you have on a given artifact, the more they cost.<br />
Not unlike xp for levels, it increases.<br />
<br />
So consider it like reputation, artifact power is the reputation gained from a given mob you kill.<br />
Artifact knowledge is a per-character buff to how much reputation you gain from everything<br />
The cost per trait increases the further progressed it is, and so a lower progressed one can gain more traits from the same amount of power.<br />
Bit like how friendly, honored, revered and exalted all require more to reach the next stage.</div></div><hr />

Maybe wait and see what they replaced Thal'dranath with before crying about it. If it was a choice between yet another zone or new dungeons then I'm glad they scrapped it, did we really want Tanaan 2.0?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I dunno man. I think they might be on to something. We could just log in and level and not actually level then all of a sudden we kill a boar and BAM level up. Out of nowhere! That would be so much fun. Think of how much fun it would be to go up to a vendor to get a tool for your profession and you click on buy but nothing happens, so you click it again, nothing. Click it 14 more times then BOOM it's in your bag. FUN!</div></div><hr />

Yeah I must have missed the sign when I was leveling up. I chose two crafting professions. I had no clue I was doing it wrong. Maybe they could build a sign next to the trainers to let everyone know how to do it right.

Yes, it clearly takes a lot of time to develop expansion when you try to reinvent the fucking game each and every time. How about deciding how the game should be once and for all and be satisfied with it? No one asked for halls, no one asked for updated animations which they say takes a shitload of time, yet they do it. WHY? Update those damn animations as a side project instead and implement it when it's finally finished instead of wasting time like this.<br />
<br />
I kind of agree. The MoP model worked, why not stick with it for a couple of expansions, and add/tweak/remove as needed? It sounds like they're moving back to that, so it's good. <br />
<br />
But we all know what would happen if they did just leave everything alone for an expansion: &quot;OMG recycled content, Blizzard is so fucking lazy!&quot; &quot;Nothing new, it's all the same, Blizzard sucks!&quot; <br />
<br />
I know a lot of it has to be developer burn out. They let them rebuild and tinker and try new things, so they don't get burned out and leave, but WoD was too much of a change, too soon, and was disjointed, scrambled, and poorly executed. <br />
<br />
And it's a backdoor admission that they intended to charge people more, for less content, they knew it from the start. They get a heary &quot;fuck you&quot; for that - and it's why if I ever consider returning to this game, which isn't likely, I'll wait until people play it, before paying for it. <br />
<br />
And I'm calling bullshit that pristine servers were not intended for the vanilla crowd. I can't be arsed to go look it up, but they were first discussed in the context and in a discussion of vanilla servers. And, from Ion's comments...they're not working on legacy servers. 'We're focused on Legion&quot;. Sorry, legacy guys.<br />

How do they in ANY way capture the spirit of world drops from vanilla?

There are players that are double crafting professions wishing they had a gathering profession now and to some extent that is how it should be.<br />
With Garrisons everyone was self sufficient and there wasn't much of a reason to trade or interact with other players.<br />

This entire thing is such bullshit and they refuse to acknowledge it. Hunters can transmog guns into bows and vice versa - two completely separate animations. I don't know any assassination rogue who would want to use swords/maces/axes in place of daggers - but if someone for whatever reason wanted to use maces or axes, apply the stormstrike animation to it.

I've NEVER spoiled the story for myself that much on a beta, heck I usually don't go for the loremaster stuff until the end of an expansion, but here I've already done it on the beta b/c I enjoy it that much.<br />
<br />
And even now, at 110, my map is absolutely full of stuff to do. It's not stuff I have to do, it's stuff I can pick and choose what I feel like going to do based on whether I want that particular reward or not. And the dungeons! Good grief the dungeons, we haven't had dungeons like this in ages. They actually put some though into them.<br />

3 tiers is fine as long as there isn't a drought as long as Siege/HFC. An improvement on WoD's pitiful amount of raids. I doubt the Warcraft movie attributed to whether Thal'Dranath was getting removed or not. And they have already announced a dungeon for 7.1 so if/until they change their minds I guess we will have to wait and see. Supposedly our 7.1 dungeon is Karazhan Crypts. And finally why would they remove any of the 10 finished dungeons if they are ready for launch?

I think Ion meant to say, &quot;There are player that are double crafting professions wishing that the devs would take their heads out of their own asses&quot;.<br />
<br />
Seriously, BoP items that can only be acquired by gatherers and are needed by crafters is asinine. This does three things:<br />
<br />
1) People who've invested years (and in many cases, gold) into collecting recipes on double crafting professions are now SoL (full disclosure: I have several characters impacted thusly)<br />
2) Removes one of the first handful of choices a new character has to make: self-sufficiency, reliance on the market/alt for crafting resources or supplying the market with resources for income.<br />
3) Alts now need to farm mats in addition to your main(s). Nothing I love more than having to go mining for my Blacksmith toon then having to do it all again for my Engineering toon.<br />
<br />
And for what purpose? Blizz's expectation seems now to be, &quot;We don't want there to be a market for crafting resources&quot; and I just can't wrap my head around why. <br />
<br />
Prior to WoD, I began every expac knowing I'd be spending tens of thousands of gold on crafting mats so I could get my professions leveled and items crafted so I could be raid ready and I knew full well this was a choice I not only made when I rolled my toon, but that I made again every time in the period of preparing for a new expansion. Judging by the prices I needed to pay in those first two weeks of an expansion, the gatherers felt similarly about their choices to supply my demand. In fact, I still occasionally give a guildmate of mine some tongue-in-cheek grief over him gouging the ores market at the beginning of MoP that resulted in me basically giving him about 75K in gold for what I needed to get Blacksmithing leveled and producing Living Steel that my raid team would need.<br />

It really shouldn't though to that thing you quoted. It should allow freedom and the bloods should be sellable.

It's ironic that they use this example, when Stormstrike literally used the mutilate animation for a long time, even with maces. I've used client-side mods to replace my dagger models with swords and it looks badass and awesome.<br />

I find that change pretty strange as well. In WoD you had no use for gathering professions because of the Garrison, but going to the other extreme is not a good idea either. I started levelling up Enchanting after my Mining profession was worth nothing because of inflation, so now I have to level up my Mining again on my main just because of this change.</div></div><hr />

IE, if I get a duplicate tier helmet can I only trade it to people of my own class and spec? Or does it function like a tier token that can be traded to anybody eligible for that token? I'm assuming it's probably the former, which really limits the usefulness I think.

I see Legion looking better on the surface but still the same half ass garrison garbage and filling up the percent bar vague set of goals that people are tired of. Give the player back clear numbers for quests and gear so we have a target on the top of the mountain that we see instead of a cloudy unknown. A little RNG is fine but Blizzard seems to be using that to control and take any creativity away that the player might initiate and this is not fun.</div></div><hr />

What area did they scrap in MoP out of curiosity because I don't remember any being scrapped between the announcement from Blizzcon upto release? Also 3 tiers is perfectly fine as long as there is no year plus drought. MoP's final 2 tiers were single raids that were quite decent. Also I do agree with you on the Thal'Dranath replacement it probably will just be TI 3.0.</div></div><hr />

Crystol Song Forest was supposed to have a lot more quests and a bigger plot. There are also several portals in the Wyrmrest temple that they never used. <br />
<br />
How about the Azshara Crater cut battleground from Vanilla. Kezan was cut. The emerald dream. There were also supposed to be siege weapons but those did eventually get added in Wrath. Karazhan crypts was an empty zone you could sneak into. Cverns of time go delayed until BC<br />

Cata cut abyssal maw and turned the war of the ancients raid into a dungeon.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mmoceb1073a651</div><div class="date">2016-06-17, 10:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;We here at Blizzard read a bit about operant conditioning in our Introduction to Psychology textbooks and boy we can really translate that into fun for everyone. Man that mouse will hit that lever hard when there's a tiny chance of a slightly bigger pellet coming down the chute!&quot;<br />
<br />
And I can add as someone with a degree in psychology: There are phenomenons similar to the learned helplesness, which also neatly correspond to a totally different outcome of such lotteries. If people try for some time to get the achieved result, and they fail, and they don't even know if they could succeed anyhow, because the chance is so small, then they just give up. Such things are of course also not fun at all.<br />
<br />
Operant conditioning works best if you don't get your goodies every time you do something, but quite often. So, if you have a reasonable chance to get something, then you will try again if you don't get it on the first, second or third time. But if chances drop, then people just stop to care. This comes along with disappointment.<br />
<br />
There are exceptions, in cases where the reward is that good, so you are willing to invest a bunch of time (like 1% mount drops in case of mount collectors). But these are niche situations for a niche audience, specially tailored to such kind of people with a special interest. But to generalise such concepts over the whole game is a very bad idea.<br />
<br />
And yes, just like someone here already mentionned - it is very fulfilling to finally get a reputation to exalted, or to finish a legendary questline, or to collect all mats for an expensive crafted item or whatever. Such things are quite deterministic (even with some random elements within), and they still bring the joy of reaching the final goal. <br />
<br />
You even have a motivational bonus in such cases, because you see the progress of your achievement on various reputation steps, on the progress in the questline, or in the progress of collecting the amount(s) of material(s). In case of a totally random item, you don't have such a motivation bonus. It's an inferior solution to keeping players motivated to repeat a task.</div></div><hr />

In Legion, if you get an item from a dungeon or raid with personal loot that isn't an upgrade for you (lower or equal item level for that slot), you can trade it to another eligible player.<br />

<br />
Seriously, BoP items that can only be acquired by gatherers and are needed by crafters is asinine. This does three things:<br />
<br />
1) People who've invested years (and in many cases, gold) into collecting recipes on double crafting professions are now SoL (full disclosure: I have several characters impacted thusly)<br />
2) Removes one of the first handful of choices a new character has to make: self-sufficiency, reliance on the market/alt for crafting resources or supplying the market with resources for income.<br />
3) Alts now need to farm mats in addition to your main(s). Nothing I love more than having to go mining for my Blacksmith toon then having to do it all again for my Engineering toon.<br />
<br />
And for what purpose? Blizz's expectation seems now to be, &quot;We don't want there to be a market for crafting resources&quot; and I just can't wrap my head around why. <br />
<br />
Prior to WoD, I began every expac knowing I'd be spending tens of thousands of gold on crafting mats so I could get my professions leveled and items crafted so I could be raid ready and I knew full well this was a choice I not only made when I rolled my toon, but that I made again every time in the period of preparing for a new expansion. Judging by the prices I needed to pay in those first two weeks of an expansion, the gatherers felt similarly about their choices to supply my demand. In fact, I still occasionally give a guildmate of mine some tongue-in-cheek grief over him gouging the ores market at the beginning of MoP that resulted in me basically giving him about 75K in gold for what I needed to get Blacksmithing leveled and producing Living Steel that my raid team would need.<br />
<br />
Why remove this from the players?<br />
<br />
Also, Tailoring (no gathering profession supplement, only occasionally needing herbs or leather) and Enchanting (gathering skill integrated into the profession) are heavily affected. This was always a perfect match for clothies, and was especially a reasonable pick for my BE mage (because BE get a profession bonus on enchanting). What now? It will take ages to get the fishing artifact and all traits to be able to fish BoS. <br />
<br />
They want to make professions better and at the same time pull such thing? This is either totally stupid, or a malevolent move. Like they don't know the history of their own game anymore.</div></div><hr />

&quot;In Warlords, if you were going to daily quests or run a dungeon you knew at the start of that session that nothing exciting could happen. Warforged, Titanforged, and legendary items should help to add the possibility of some excitement.&quot;<br />
<br />
RNG is so frustrating when there's no other way to get something. I've raided for like 8 months of HFC on my Monk through Heroic and then 9/13 Mythic with the same guild the entire time, as the only leather user in the team for a large portion of that time, and in that entire time I didn't get a single gem slot, and only got 2 warforged items. I'm sure that I'm in the more extreme cases of bad luck, but I can tell you there was nothing fun or exciting about that. <br />
<br />
But that's not even the real issue. Even if I'd had 3-4 gems and 3-4 warforged items its still not BIS. Because BIS is near impossible to get with this RNG system, and that's what I find the most frustrating. Getting BIS in past expansions was one of the biggest senses of achievement you could get as a PvE player, and now that's gone. Even with Warforged in MoP, at least for 25M the probablity of WF items was high enough that by the end of SoO most players in 25M guilds were full Warforged BIS. But now with the RNG of not just WF/Titanforged procs, but variable proc ilvl, AND gem procs, it's almost statistically impossible to get true BIS, and that's just the most disappointing thing.</div></div><hr />

1) People who've invested years (and in many cases, gold) into collecting recipes on double crafting professions are now SoL (full disclosure: I have several characters impacted thusly)<br />
2) Removes one of the first handful of choices a new character has to make: self-sufficiency, reliance on the market/alt for crafting resources or supplying the market with resources for income.<br />
3) Alts now need to farm mats in addition to your main(s). Nothing I love more than having to go mining for my Blacksmith toon then having to do it all again for my Engineering toon.<br />
<br />
And for what purpose? Blizz's expectation seems now to be, &quot;We don't want there to be a market for crafting resources&quot; and I just can't wrap my head around why. <br />
<br />
Prior to WoD, I began every expac knowing I'd be spending tens of thousands of gold on crafting mats so I could get my professions leveled and items crafted so I could be raid ready and I knew full well this was a choice I not only made when I rolled my toon, but that I made again every time in the period of preparing for a new expansion. Judging by the prices I needed to pay in those first two weeks of an expansion, the gatherers felt similarly about their choices to supply my demand. In fact, I still occasionally give a guildmate of mine some tongue-in-cheek grief over him gouging the ores market at the beginning of MoP that resulted in me basically giving him about 75K in gold for what I needed to get Blacksmithing leveled and producing Living Steel that my raid team would need.<br />
<br />
Why remove this from the players?<br />
<br />
It sounded like the main reason for this was so the crafter could make more money from what he crafts. I, too, remember in WOTLK having players bring me the mats for me to craft an item and getting a tip for doing so. I still was able to sell items on the AH for players who did not gather mats and make money. If the goal is for a crafter to be able to make gold from his goods, why couldn't they at least make the crafting reagent account wide so we can have alts who do the gathering for our craft toons? This is what I always did and it worked very well. Just making it so we can only transfer the ore or skins or cloth or whatever between our alts and not to other players would accomplish the same thing of making gold for a player. Or so it seems to me.</div></div><hr />

No, things can only drop higher item lvl, not lower. As he said, mythic lvl gear can drop in lower difficulties, but mythic will still be drop mythic.<br />

It really shouldn't though to that thing you quoted. It should allow freedom and the bloods should be sellable. Basically anyone with 2 crafting professions on one toon is screwed now because they cannot obtain bloods without giving one up and going to a gatherer. Or level fishing I suppose.<br />
<br />
Blood is going to drop from a lot of activity, so you don't really have to choose a gathering profession if you don't have 1. The blood being BoP just makes it so that crafted items are going to have time value, aswell as resourse value. You are going to be able to sell your items, dependent on how much time you have played the game. This is really not gonna change anything for most players, who have double crafting on their mains, since you are proberly gonna drown in blood when you play a lot, but it will pretty much stop players from making alts, just to have a crafting spec on it.<br />
<br />
I think it is great, that you can't sell it. It makes stuff more valueable, and people are not doing to deflate the prices of items, just because people are farming the blood on mass. I would not mind it being BoA, since i think as long as you play the game, it should not matter which character you play on.... But this is fine aswell.<br />

<br />
IE, if I get a duplicate tier helmet can I only trade it to people of my own class and spec? Or does it function like a tier token that can be traded to anybody eligible for that token? I'm assuming it's probably the former, which really limits the usefulness I think. (In my guild, at least, it seems to be the tier gear that people struggle to get even after we go Master Loot later on.)<br />
<br />
You will proberly be able to trade it with any other player in your group. It will proberly follow the rules, which items are using today on normal master loot. For a set amount of time, you will be able to trade the item to any other member of your group/raid. This is just going to apply for Personal Loot now, with items which are lower item lvl then your current.<br />

Blizzard makes a lot of cuts during the making of their expansions and games. Even back to TBC, they have always made more stuff then they could finish, and a lot of stuff also did not really work as it should have. So yeah, i do believe that it was a coincidence. I do also believe, that it was proberly set in static, because they did not know if they could finish it in time. The devs proberly told Lore to say, that it was not deleted/cut, because it actually was not at that point, but that keeping it in might give a fake view of how the final product would look like.<br />

I really the guy. He might bring bad news once in a while, but he always have arguments for their actions. He speaks with a clear voice and he really seems like he knows the game through and through. When he talks about changes, that might badly affect some playerbase, he always talks about the playerbase, that benifits, so there is never a lose/lose situation. He is by far my favority Blizz dev, even over Kaplan.<br />
<br />
I really like these Q&amp;A pieces, because it feels like we, as a community, are getting to know more and more about the game. The less closed the expansion/patch production is, the better.<br />

People who are defending blizzard about content cuts are pure fan boys who don't care about themselves. Look around. You are only fooling yourself and others and nothing good comes out of it in the end. There probably wont be any replacement content for Tha'dranath that's going to be better than taan/timeless isle. They scrapped an area in mop too. These are all business tactics. If they just gave players everything , they'd be closing up shop. Making WoD so contentless makes Legion's content ok, even though it isn't that much. An ideal expansion will be with 3 tiers but more side raids. But we are only getting 2 additional raids instead of 4 .<br />
<br />

<br />
Would you rather have a terrible zone like Gorgrond(or even worse) or would you rather have them to focus on zones, they actually care about and want to make better. Blizz always cuts stuff, even more then we see in-game, but it mostly because it is shit content and it would be bad for the game.<br />

The UI is a mess for most people, sometimes pushing a button or pulling a lever without really knowing what has changed undtil later. Them cleaing up the UI for normal play is good, and if you are a person to change your UI/options a lot, then you will proberly have an easy time getting the addons, which opens them up, anyway.<br />

No they haven't, if they have they start truncating irrelevant content which no-one is practically doing. Vanilla, Outland and Northrend should just be removed period, Raids shut down and tell the people who didn't get the Phoenix, the head and the flying undead horse to F*** the right off , as that's the purpose of Caverns of Time and the Black Market for god sakes. No one is crying about the unobtainable Gladiators mounts so they shouldn't bother with the WCIII to WOTLK story which has no relevance to the current Old Gods story-line. You can have 1000 people working on the game and they still wouldn't be up to scratch cause everything goes up exponentially in each expansion you have to make sure every past expansion works in cohesion in the future expansions.<br />

No the existing content right now which no one is practically doing except for like 2-3 people at one time isn't doing you any favors and is LIMITING NEW CONTENT BEING MADE as any change MADE in the CURRENT OR NEW EXPANSION has to funnel down right to the BASE expansion which is some hogwash mix of Vanilla and Cata and must apply right down to the very basic of Molten Core 1st raid. How many of you are doing MC right now? Or how about a BRD enchant runs? Hardly any probably some 1 weird person so why is it in there? Why couldn't they re-use the raids as some special event, People liked the New MC 40 man run in WOD why not re-use the old raids for people who haven't done it as well as incite nostalgia into people?<br />
<br />
This should of been done in Cata to keep the size of the game manageable but alas they didn't and now I just can't wait to see Dalaran at 2 PLACES at once, Northrend and Broken Isles breaking any sort of continuity in the game especially when they said &quot;WE WANT TO DEVELOP THE LORE EVEN MORE&quot; when in fact they are doing the complete opposite right now !!! Well they managed to achieve having the same 25 followers on every alt and character and say that your character is &quot;relevant&quot; to the game when it facts detracts it and puts you into the role of a faceless commander and especially with the LAST ARCHIMONDE battle where you have 3 F**** NPCS helping you!!! <br />
<br />
If they had any sense, cut off Outland and Northrend so you don't have 2 Illdians and 2 Dalarans and 2 of fucking everything running around. Next it's gonna be Darksiders II: WOW Edition where everything exists in three's.<br />
<br />
FFXIV done it correctly with plots and so forth and even has gambling which makes the game more immersive than WOW atm...</div></div><hr />

&quot;No, it's still there. Just an old map image. There's a zone there&quot;<br />
&quot;J/K, it's removed.&quot;</div></div><hr />

&quot;It won't be a reduction in content delivered to players, just that the team had a better and way cooler idea.&quot;<br />

&quot;Weekly Events<br />
<br />
Time-walking is awesome and the team will continue to expand upon it going forward.&quot;<br />
It's not really &quot;awesome&quot; and you don't find that many who would say they love it cept people with stupid nostalgia feels who do all of -1k dps and then wonder why they are removed from the dungeon. People tolerate them to get their 500vp for the week or trying to get the timereaver. Most of us would be happy if we could just buy the timereaver so we never have to do them again. If there is more rewards added not crap gear then maybe they would be worth it but they really aren't fun or even tolerable unless you have a premade group/friends who have a set/aren't awful. I'm not really sure how they can be fixed to suck less either. Well is it possible to make it so you don't get grouped with 4 players from Ragnaros or other South American servers that don't speak english lol?<br />
<br />
A lot of the other stuff I guess we can read about all this and half of it never happens lol.<br />
Positive notes I am liking Suramar a lot :D</div></div><hr />

I can stand level up without flying and working towards it, but months without it totally broke my enjoyment of the game during WoD.</div></div><hr />

Longer expansions give us time to explore the world that was created and time for the team to get the next expansion done right.<br />
<br />
FINALLY. FUCKING FINALLY.<br />
<br />
I could have said on day 1 this stupid idea was annouced: Why the fuck would I want all the gear I just spent weeks/months earning to be immediately invalidated by a new expansion?<br />
<br />
I'm already unhappy all my gear is obsolete once every 2-3 years, let alone if I was to just get done with a raid and find myself having to level up again.<br />
<br />
Well done to the team for finally coming to the right conclusion.</div></div><hr />
