Thor In-Game Pet in SC2 Collector Edition 
According to a press release published a few hours ago, Blizzard will offer a WoW in-game pet with the collector edition of Starcraft 2. So far it looks like that if you didn't plan to buy Starcraft 2 and REALLY want your pet, you will have to pay $100 for it.  
 
The good news is, if you want the Starcraft 2 Collector Edition and do not care about the pet, you will probably sell it on ebay for $90.

According to a press release published a few hours ago, Blizzard will offer a WoW in-game pet with the collector edition of Starcraft 2. So far it looks like that if you didn't plan to buy Starcraft 2 and REALLY want your pet, you will have to pay $100 for it. <br />

Cataclysm Preview: Warrior Q&amp;A<br />
Here are some follow ups based on what is being discussed.<br />
<br />
Q: Will the rotation for a Fury Warrior just be Bloodthirst and Slam with Heroic Strike to burn off rage?<br />
A: We think Fury is going to end up needing another attack in there for single-target fights. Furious Sundering was intended more as having to Sunder being less of a penalty, but at only 3 stacks, it may not end up being a big deal and we don’t want Fury to feel like they have to purchase a talent that they may not always use. We don’t want Whirlwind to be a good button against single targets however. It essentially gets “free” damage against groups of targets when it’s effective at using against single targets. It’s okay if warriors still do more damage in fights where they can use Cleave and similar attacks often, but right now it’s too extreme.<br />
<br />
Q: Are one-handed Fury warriors going to be competing with rogues for one-handed weapons?<br />
A: This is unlikely. Rogues and shaman will want one-handers with Agility, while warriors and death knights will want them with Strength. I won’t be surprised when one of these classes picks up the other’s weapon as it could be an upgrade simply based on the damage, but it won’t be optimal.<br />
<br />
Q: Why are warriors not getting some kind of AoE tanking tool?<br />
A: We think the newly buffed Thunder Clap plus Shockwave are sufficient abilities for AoE tanking. The design of Vengeance should make sure that threat generation doesn’t start to slip behind as the dps characters gear up. It’s not our intention that tanks face a constant struggle to generate enough threat, even in group situations, but we also don’t want threat to be totally irrelevant either. The danger for tanking too many creatures should also be tank death not threat management.<br />
<br />
Q: Is only Sunder Armor being changed?<br />
A: Rogue Expose Armor and other abilities that apply a similar debuff are being changed accordingly. They will all provide the same debuff at 12% armor reduction.<br />
<br />
Q: What about rage loss when changing stances?<br />
A: We still want the act of changing stances to require more consideration than just clicking two buttons to use the ability you want. One idea we are going to explore is that you don’t lose rage when you change stances, but you won’t gain additional rage for a short period of time after changing. This lets you say swap to do an Execute without losing your rage bar, but still keeps the idea that shifting constantly comes with inherent efficiency risks.<br />
<br />
Q: Is the intent of Gushing Wound that warriors constantly ask for targets to be kited around?<br />
A: No, it’s intended to be a bonus when you’re in an encounter where the target either moves around a lot (Ex. BONNNNE STORMMMM-ing Marrowgar) or just has to be moved around a lot (say Lich King). Warriors shouldn’t have the expectation of forcing every PvE opponent to move but it would be entertaining to watch this (from a third party perspective). :)</div></div><hr />

Yes, you are correct, nobody is forced to buy the CE edition. However, I'm pretty sure that there will be, lets say many players who collect pets and/or achievements in WoW, and there will be people who will buy it not because of SC2, but just to get that robot. Just like there is people paying 300$(or how much is it?) for Spectral Tiger and other TCG rewards.</div></div><hr />

If you're not planning on playing wow after sc2 launches but still want the CE, you can sell the pet online(or it sounds like you can I'm not really sure) <br />
the way i look at it its an extra 40 for an artwork book,2gb usb flash drive,behind the scene dvd, ost cd, a comic book and a dlc. the pet is just something that tags along. <br />
40 for all those dont seem like much tbh (although i dont how much those individual items would cost if sold seperately)<br />
I'd say it's a pretty cool deal for a COLLECTOR. <br />
<br />
EDIT: looking at the warrior Q/A seems like ret pally's divine storm will prolly be changed too?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Then turn around and sell the game unused with everything else in it to someone who doesn't play WOW but wants the game and the rest of the shit for $75 or something.<br />

<br />
It's a new trend that's developing. As far as I know, this will be the 3rd recent PC game with a $60 price tag (the other two being Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 and Assassin's Creed 2). I don't think the other two games sold too well on the PC, but then again, they were mainly just console ports. Since Starcraft is an very popular PC game series, it stands a better chance of establishing a foothold for higher priced games on the PC.<br />
<br />

As far as I know, this will be the 3rd recent PC game with a $60 price tag (the other two being Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 and Assassin's Creed 2). I don't think the other two games sold too well on the PC, but then again, they were mainly just console ports. Since Starcraft is an very popular PC game series, it stands a better chance of establishing a foothold for higher priced games on the PC.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Not sure if it's trend so much as inflation and development cost rising. Although personally I felt the $50 point was nice and comfortable...<br />
<br />
But honestly, the games you mentioned (and Starcraft 2) are high profile AAA games with a lot of expectations around them and they know they'll sell X copies regardless of it being $10 more or not.<br />
<br />
Personally, I think companies shouldn't be so rigid on the pricing, certain games should release for $40 or less. I'd be more inclined to buy games I didn't really care enough about if they was $25-35 as opposed to $60 right off the bat.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Don't think even Blizzard knows the answer to that yet.<br />
<br />
With the way it's been lately with Blizzard being a superstar in the development world, I suspect they'll do CE's for them as well to get $20 more out of it or more maybe (they might add more WoW pets each time since clearly they like to troll for kids)</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">conscript</div><div class="date">2010-04-08, 06:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">$100 is pretty crappy but I think I can justify paying an extra $40 for a game I was already going to buy for the sweet box it will come in along with the art book (not to mention the WoW pet obviously). I love all the junk that came with the last collectors edition for WoW so I imagine this stuff is going to be pretty cool as well.<br />
<br />
My only concern with the price is how much are the &quot;expansion&quot; packs going to cost for SC2? I really hope they don't retail for the full $60 as well, but I expect them to be in the $20-30 range considering they are basically only single-player games. Then again, I have seen a lot of other single player games, with less depth and playtime than the Toss and Zerg campaigns will have, retail for $60 on Xbox.</div></div><hr />

I don't care if it costs $40 or 50 cents more than the normal edition of the game. Its not the money that bothers me, its the fact that the pet, at least in my opinion, is out of place in the SC2 CE. It feels like they were out of ideas what else to put in it and some guy came with the idea to spend several hours on making the universal &quot;reward&quot;- WoW ingame pet, so the people won't complain about it costing almost twice the original game and having not enough extras for those money.</div></div><hr />

I suspect that will be it as far as CE versions go. At least I hope that is it as I really don't want to shell out $40 for each one of those CEs as well. Although if they come with an art book and a WoW pet I probably will lol.</div></div><hr />

Fact is a lot of Starcraft fans do play WoW, also another fact is yes, Blizzard is trying to get WoW players that never experienced the Starcraft universe a push towards getting into it with a pet with it.<br />
<br />
Bottom line though is its a bonus for those that want it. If you just want the pet, sell the game without it to someone that doesn't play WoW for farks sake!</div></div><hr />

Its called cross promotion. Why do you think the original CE pets were mini-diablo and a zergling? They are well known objects from other Blizzard properties that can reel in additional sales possibly. I'm sure the plan was to always include a Wow pet with the SC2 CE just like there will be one with the Diablo 3 CE. People who exclusively play SC2 will buy the game for the game and eBay the pet for people who exclusively play Wow to buy. For the rest of us who play both this is a welcome gift that is liekly coming at no extra cost than the CE already would have.</div></div><hr />

Not the CE, but the regular one. It should be $49.99, not $59.99. Only Xbox360 and PS3 games are priced that high, PC games are normally $10-$20 cheaper.<br />
<br />
<br />
2 reasons:<br />
<br />
1) even without licensing fees, PC game development is still getting expensive just like console games, throw in fear of piracy, and it's possible they've just reached the point where they can't afford the hold pricing standard.<br />
<br />
2) From a (very simple) business perspective, there's no reason NOT to charge the same as everyone else, especially if it results in greater profit, and it's not like you have any other cheaper (and legal) place to go since all other forms of gaming uses the new price point standard (well...the wii, which I personally love for Resident evil, Mario, and Zelda, but i don't think i'm in the majority here).<br />
<br />
To be honest, i'm surprised the PC gaming crowd got away with the old $50 price point as long as it did.</div></div><hr />

The main goal is to interest people who play WoW in playing SC2 and to give people playing SC2 a reason to try out WoW. It's Blizz's product, it only makes sense to reward people for buying other Blizz products.</div></div><hr />

They require much more skill, faster reflexes, and quicker thinking than other games.<br />
<br />
About pricing: <br />
<br />
When I was a kid (say, 20 years ago), newly released Nintendo and Sega games were $50-$70. Today, games are still the same price. Considering the inflation since then is approx. 61.95%, you should actually be paying around $97 for the standard retail version and $162 for the collectors edition.<br />
<br />
Games have largely been unaffected by economic changes. Considering the amount of entertainment value you get compared to other forms, games are DIRT CHEAP.<br />
<br />
Also consider the fact that it's free to play SC2 (and likely D3) on Battle.net. Would you pay $60 or $100 for WoW if there was no monthly fee?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
An exclusive 2GB USB flash drive replica of Jim Raynor's dog tag, which comes preloaded with the original StarCraft and the StarCraft: Brood War® expansion set<br />
<br />
That right there is $20 ($25 if you count the flash drive) as far as I am reading. Yes, the idea of selling the old game with the new game, when the CE itself will most likely be desired by SC veterans, is a bit awkward, but I can see why the price is high if they are basically giving you two games (three if you count expansions).</div></div><hr />

Gaming industry is affected by economic change, they just also have the benefit of selling more and more each year at the same price, effectively negating inflation.<br />

I'm pretty sure PC games were $54.99 a few years back, the same price as console games. It's just that because of widespread piracy, most PC game developers had to cut their price to be competitive with piracy. It's like iTunes pricing. Songs and albums are cheaper today than in the '90s because they have to compete with piracy.<br />
<br />
I don't think Blizzard has the same problems with piracy that other PC game developers have so they're free to price as much as console game developers do.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Price is not just about demand. It's also about marginal benefit versus marginal cost. Back then (around the early 90s), Nintendo and Sega used to sell overpriced cartriges for $35 or so to game publishers. Third party game developers weren't allowed to sell games on the Nintendo and Sega consoles without buying those overpriced cartriges from Nintendo and Sega. Nintendo and Sega consequently made a ton of profit from it. That's why games sold for as much as $75 back then, because games had a cost of at least $35 to make for third party publishers.<br />
<br />
The reason Sony was able to muscle in on the console business with the original Playstation was that it used CDs that cost less than $1 to make. They'd take a cut from third party game sales without requiring publishers to buy an overpriced cartridge from them. Obviously, many third party developers jumped ship.<br />
<br />
The reason games cost $59.99 on consoles is that it costs around $1 to manufacture a game nowadays. So companies just try to maximize the profit by having a price point that they think would result in the most money when they multiply price with unit sales, since the cost to manufacture is almost negligible. When they had to buy $35 cartridges, they had to price it much higher to maximize profit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm merely stating that a game such as MW2 that offers a single player fps experience that lasts 3 hours, is not something i would ever consider buying because for me personally it doesn't offer good value for money.<br />
<br />
When i buy an fps game that costs $60, i expect a solid single player campaign experience and a great multiplayer experience too.<br />
<br />
MW2 didn't offer this. Thus, i didn't buy it.<br />
<br />
If you bought it, enjoyed it, and thought it served you good value for money, great. Buy some more. Nobody is saying any different.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm saying the point is moot. A vast majority of the people who bought the game, bought it for the sole purpose of playing the multi-player. Using your personal opinion as a sweeping statement about a game says little to nothing about the game as a whole. The games selling point was multi-player, the fact that you didn't like a small aspect of the game gives no credit to the argument whether it is worth $60.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Game itself was announced to have the price of 59.99.<br />
A Sandisk 2GB Flash Drive costs 10 dollars on Amazon, but this comes with the original Starcraft and expansion, probably worth around 15 dollars.<br />
Art of Starcraft, if you look at the most recent WoW artbook, its valued at 20 dollars.<br />
Now, the mini ingame pet Thor for WoW. The ingame pets that Blizzard offers usually go for 10 dollars on the Blizzard store.<br />
<br />
So 60 dollars (game) + 10 (flash drive) + 15 (starcraft + expansion) + 20 (artbook) + 10 (mini pet) = 115 Dollars<br />
<br />
Now, I havn't included everything that you get because I can't guesstimate the value: Behind the scenes DVD, Starcraft comic book issue #0, sound track, and exclusive BNet portraits/decals for your BNet profile.<br />
<br />
So, if you plan on buying this, you'll most likely be getting your money's worth. Than again, &quot;beauty is in the eye of the beholder&quot;. Hope this helps</div></div><hr />

$60 is the new normal price point for major releases of major franchises known to sell well (Call of Duty MW2 for example).<br />
<br />
Honestly if you follow all the market research and all that jazz they SHOULD be selling games for about $80-90. That's what they are actually worth based on cost to produce and other factors. But no one would pay it so they discount it as much as they can while not losing their pants. <br />
<br />
That's why they have all the CE, DLC, etc. They recoup the value they actually need to charge to do business through extended services and after-sale and/or value-added items.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thats nice and all but this is how it actually works these days:<br />
<br />
Release 80% of game in box for: $60<br />
Release Special Edition, with $10 of garbage with a &quot;estimated retail value of $100&quot; for: $100<br />
Release remaining 20% as DLC for: $15 ( which only 50% of buyers will purchase )<br />
<br />
So really, yes, you are paying ~80% for the full game, you're just nickel and dimed into it.<br />
<br />
( and if you want to argue that DLC is 'extra' and not built into initial development costs, then go elsewhere, because you're simply wrong, this is planned from Day 1 of development )</div></div><hr />

Source? Because right now when I log into the beta you can't even see the main menu without putting in your account info.

I like Starcraft and all but... considering they are separating the campaigns of SC2 into 3 different releases, probably charging $60 for each of them... probably $100 for the Zerg and Protoss special editions as well... Blizzard will already be getting enough of my money. I aint giving them $100 for a campaign and mediocre, in-game transformer.<br />
<br />
<br />
I doubt that the expansions would be anything close to 100 dollars. But we'll have to wait until Cataclysm comes out to see. As it stands, they'd probably 40 dollars for the normal and 70 for the CE, like the WoW expansions have been. As for the 100 dollar price tag, I wonder if people are just seeming to gloss over everything else that comes in the box that could more than justify the price.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Do you honestly believe that Blizzard did not put it in there to get some extra cash?<br />
<br />
<br />
They could remove the pet and still push the SC2 collector's edition for roughly the same with all the other swag included in the package.<br />
The pet is a fringe benefit for diehard fans who are willing to shell out so much for the collector packages of all things Blizzard.</div></div><hr />

Being forced to use a Internet connection prevents you from playing SCII on lan-party in places where there is no Internet access. Playing on a local area network is (in my honnest opinion) the very soul of Starcraft and Warcraft III. It provided a lot of fun. Constrain SCII to an Internet access won't help that philosophy, people will rather play SCII being geographically alone.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It has nothing to do with activision.<br />
<br />
D2 Expac went for 35 bucks at a time when 25 was the norm for a PC expansion. WC3 went for 60 when the norm was 50 even for a console game. WC3 expac went for 40 bucks when the norm was 30 for an Xpac. <br />
<br />
Blizzard has been charging a premium since D2, because they can. People know they're getting good value even at 10 dollars extra.<br />

Bobby Kotick/Activision are very easy to hate, but don't let your hatred make your retarded.<br />
<br />
**IF* you want to blame something on activision, blame the decision to break the game into 3 pieces vs 2 in the past. Blizzard has a history of selling a game, then selling an expansion, then moving onto the next game. The trend of making a game and then 17 expansions is a trick that started with EA and Activision.</div></div><hr />

Non of you have ever played on Steam or the SC2 Beta. Now to put this to terms to wow. The pet will be tied to your Bnet account. So why do you think you will be able to sell it? Short answer is you can't. Because what do you think you log in to Starcraft 2 with... Oh I think it is wait for it.. Bnet. The same Bnet account your pet will be going to. Now that is how I think they will do it, but I could be wrong. Seeing as how the CD key you buy will be a SC2: CE one, and the account you will tie it too will the account you log into both games with. Not sure a Bnet account can be used to log into two different games with. For example Steam once you log in and pick a game your in. So lets say someone logs into your steam account. You get booted from the game and the reason given is &quot;Your Steam account is being used on another Computer.&quot;</div></div><hr />

Yeah, Rogues do seem to be kind of like Hunters with just auto-attack and /afk and reach the top 5 in dps... But seriously, we have like 3 skills to use, I use more skills when I'm tanking as Prot. Prot damage is a bit too big aswell.
