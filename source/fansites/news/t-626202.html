This service lets you re-customize every aspect of a character's appearance, including gender and name... <br />
[b]What is Character Re-Customization?<br />
Character Re-Customization is a paid service that lets you change an existing character's gender, face, skin color, and other cosmetic features determined by his or her race and gender combination. When you perform a Character Re-Customization, you may also change the character's hair color and hair style (similar to the in-game barbershop) and select a new name, if desired.<br />
<br />
Can I change my character's race or class?<br />
No, you cannot alter a character's race or class. You may only change cosmetic features of a character through Character Re-Customization.<br />
<br />
How much does this service cost?<br />
A single Character Re-Customization costs $15 (not including applicable taxes). This flat fee covers all customization options available for a single character.<br />
<br />
How do I know if I will be taxed?<br />
Players in select states in the U.S. may be subject to taxation when using the Character Re-Customization service. This list includes but is not limited to:<br />
- New Mexico<br />
- Texas<br />
<br />
How will my guildmates and friends know I customized my character?<br />
The re-customized character will remain in the same guild and will stay on the friends lists of anyone who had added it. If you changed the character's name, the new name will appear on friends lists in place of the old one, so we recommend you tell your friends and guildmates about the re-customization as soon as possible.<br />
<br />
Can other players use this feature to get off my ignore list?<br />
No. Characters whose names have been changed will remain on your ignore list, and their names will be updated automatically.<br />
<br />
Will this affect a character's mail or auctions?<br />
Existing in-game mail and auctions will not be interrupted or canceled. However, after you change a character's name, other players will need to send new mail to the new character name.<br />
<br />
Can I customize multiple characters at once?<br />
The Character Re-Customization service only allows one character to be customized per transaction. If you would like to customize multiple characters, you will need to process and pay for each one separately.<br />
<br />
What will happen to the character's Armory profile?<br />
Once you have completed the Character Re-Customization process, the Armory profile will be updated to reflect the character's new look and name.<br />
<br />
When will I be charged for the customization?<br />
You will be charged immediately upon pressing the confirmation button on the Character Re-Customization page.<br />
<br />
Is there any way to cancel the re-customization while the process is pending?<br />
Because the credit card is charged immediately upon confirmation, you cannot cancel the process once you have pressed the confirmation button and the character customization process is underway.<br />
<br />
After I've paid, how do I go about selecting the new gender, face, name, and so on for the character?<br />
After your payment has been processed, you will see a new button when you log in to World of Warcraft that lets you re-customize the character's features (and name, if desired) at your convenience. You do not have to re-customize the character immediately.<br />
<br />
Are there any brand-new faces, horn styles, or other cosmetic options available only through Character Re-Customization?<br />
No. The face, skin color, and other cosmetic options available through Character Re-Customization are the same as those already available to players at character creation.<br />
<br />
What if the name I want is already in use?<br />
Character names are unique on a per-realm basis. You will not be able to choose a character name that is already in use by another player on the realm.<br />
<br />
If I change the character's name, what happens to the old name?<br />
Once the name change is complete, the character's old name will be locked from use on the realm for 90 days. After that time, the old name can be claimed by any player on a first-come, first-served basis. If you want to use the name again, you will have to reclaim it before anyone else does after the 90 days have passed and the name is made available again.<br />
<br />
Can I change my character's appearance and name again if I want to?<br />
Yes, but after completing a Character Re-Customization, that specific character cannot have his or her appearance or name changed again for 30 days. After 30 days have passed, you would need to purchase another Character Re-Customization or Paid Character Name Change if you would like to choose a new appearance or name. For more information on Paid Character Name Changes, please refer to our FAQ.<br />
<br />
Is there any way to revert to the character's original name after Character Re-Customization is completed?<br />
Once you have selected the confirmation button to complete your name change, there is no way to immediately revert back to the old name. The old name is locked from use on the realm for 90 days, and you will have to perform another Character Re-Customization or Paid Character Name Change after the name is made available again. For these reasons, and because the Character Re-Customization charge is immediate and non-refundable, please be certain of your selection before you complete the process.</div></div><hr />

Many of us have played for a couple of years with the same char, and I think I speak for many other players when I say that my characters looks is getting kinda old. Same beard, same hairstyle, same sex, same facial expression etc etc.<br />
<br />
So maybe it's both a way to milk the money of poor players, and a way to get more &quot;old-school&quot; players some new fun features in to the game. Playing the same grin-faced-bald-ass-beard-covered-gnome for three years gets you kinda bored with him.<br />
<br />
But if they go with &quot;Race change&quot; or even &quot;Class change&quot;, I'm gonna go IRL.<br />
<br />
Go Blizz!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree with the poster above; you should be able to change race, as long as the destination race supports your class. So Tauren Druid &gt; Night Elf Druid would be fine, but no other race would be permitted.</div></div><hr />

And i like my character's face very much :D Green Hair ( Druid afterall.. ), Ilidan Style Face Marks ( He was a Nelf :D ), Purple Skin ( WarCraft 3 Night Elf Style ;) and everything else..<br />
<br />
It saddens me that Blizzard has decided that they are not greedy enough. Atleast i hope the money goes into StarCraft 2/Diablo 3/Unnanounced Games :)<br />
<br />
I don't get you people :/ You made a decision: You took Gnome/Human/Tauren/Undead whateva, how can you not enjoy your character as it is? I love my Night Elf Druid very much, i can PWN in PvP, its green hair/purple skin/white eyes/green marks are from lore, and after all, its a DRUID, Best Class in everything it wants, once its maximized: Tanking ( Feral, Dire Bear Form ), 2x Healing ( Balance/Restoration Single Heals/Healing over Time Spells! ), Melee DPS ( Feral, Cat Form ), Caster DPS ( Balance, Human/Moonkin Form )<br />
<br />
&lt;3 Night Elves<br />
&lt;3 Druids<br />

<br />
I started playing WoW almost three years ago. And back then I picked the game up becasue I needed something to do at night over the summer while I was out in the middle of nowhere Northern Canada doing work.<br />
<br />
I never thought that I would keep playing, and because of that did not really put much thought into my character selection. I made him a human, but other than that did not go further.<br />
<br />
Really your character should be appealing to you, and you only. For a great long time I did not enjoy my character to the fullest becasue he simply was not 'me'<br />
<br />
When the 3.0 patch hit I was able to give him a haircut but I was still never really happy with his face.<br />
<br />
I play the game a lot now, and for $15 I am more than happy to finallly spend the time creating a face that really suits my character, who he has become, and what I want him to look like.<br />
<br />
Some will think this is great idea from Blizzard, others will not. I am very happy with it though. Don't like it? You dont have to do it!</div></div><hr />

The reason we're bitching about it is because it sets a VERY dangerous precedent - like it or not but other businesses look at Blizzard and things they're implementing - if this micro payment system goes through you will start seeing weapons, armour, items and other in-game material being sold for money and it will spread to other games, several have already tried it but have luckily been repulsed so far.<br />

This been a prio among developers? Im fully aware that they got enough ppl hired so they can put a few to do this (rather usless-we-are-gready gamefeature) but the timing could have been better. Alot of classes are still having major or minor issues som releasing these kinda news at this time is unbelievebly stupid of Blizzard. Seriously thought they had more intelligent marketing people.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi we are Blizzard, there are still alot of balance issues, alot of realms suffer from 6-12 seconds latenecty in 25mans but now we can proudly present a new superduper feature that lets you...&quot; <br />
<br />
Now someone will probably type 'if you dont like it, dont use it' sure whatever, BLZ just lost alot of goodwill right there. Maybe fix the unplayable realms and they can get it back, just a thought :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
At the end of the day, some people have been playing their character for 4 years, and maybe want to change things about a bit. I think it is a good option personally, and although it costs money, $15 is not a bank breaking amount, and of course it is optional.<br />

I would say &quot;Blizzard is the new Microsoft&quot;, but the difference is, Blizzard actually listen to people. You're given something OPTIONAL that some people will want, and everyone and their mother fucking whines about it. What IS the whole deal? You put up with celebs spending millions on their looks, and ordinary people spending thousands on plastic surgery, but when it comes down to something you enjoy as much as the other people you're discussing it with, you whine, and bitch for all it's worth?! You people sicken me.<br />
<br />
And you know something, the only reason people are so defensive about this sorta thing, is because they themselves have actually thought about such options, and realised that &quot;OMG! If people find out i payed for this, they'll think i'm a sad no-lifer!&quot;. Wake up and smell the coffee, this is WoW you're playing. You've already pretty much earned that title, and it's all based on the social-reputation it's earned itself.<br />
<br />
As for the whole &quot;I want a better game than we have now with all these money-based services they're adding&quot; arguement, don't go there. I think you'll find WoW is pretty damn good compared to a vast majority of games.<br />
<br />
Blizzard are a huge company, they're doing what businesses are meant to do, and that is taking money from the consumer's and providing a service, goods, or both in exchange.<br />

Couldn't agree more but since its business they should be aware of the concept goodwill/badwill. Releasing an obvious we-want-$ feature at this time when WOTLK still needs alot of tuning isn't that smart from a business perspective either. They should have waited 1 more week or smt. Launching it at start of arena would been the smart thing to do by BLZ. Then alot of players will be excited and happy and temporarily forget the issues that WOTLK clearly suffer.<br />
<br />
I can't keep away from once again point out that alot of realms can't supply players with 25man instances cos as soon as players enter a fight the latency becomes 6-12 seconds. <br />
<br />
Timing BLZ, it's as important when making business as the product itself ;)</div></div><hr />

If you don't want to pay for it then don't. And I'll rather pay $15 real money than some absurd amount in-game, like 10 000. Which one takes more time to get? $15 or 10000G?<br />
<br />
I will probably be using this as will my brother. When I made my first character I just randomized it quickly to log in. When I made my 2nd character I made it look like the first one. Well, the 2nd character has been my main for over 2 years now and I'm kinda sick of the look of it, already changed the hairstyle as it was terrible.<br />
<br />
My brother however did make the character just the way he wanted. He just forgot to change the skin color and now hes been whining about his paleness for over 2 years.<br />
<br />
Why are you people whining about a feature which will help someone? Is it a problem to you if someone can make their character look like they want it to look?<br />
<br />
Oh and big no to race changes IF they don't have the class restrictions i.e. only tauren and nelf druids, no gnome paladins or priests.<br />

Fuck the €13 euro,-. If you go out and by some drinks for friends you even pay more and have less time fun. I mean in the end you will be looking at your character all the time.<br />

For pvp reasons its also really nice. No more mister big guy targeted first in groups cause your so big. Female tauren warrior FTW :)<br />

What you and most other whining here don't seem to realize is the following:<br />
<br />
A development/design team consists of different subgroups. The art design team doesn't have anything to do with the class balance team, and an engine programmer doesn't have anything to do with a programmer who does mob AI.<br />
<br />
Different teams have different priorities, timeframes and milestones. And while the class balance design and programming team is working on, well duh, class balance, the art team and some programmers don't have anything to do with that, so they are free to implement stuff like this &quot;plastic surgery&quot;.<br />
<br />
TLDR version: Putting something like this into the game does in no way affect the timeframe of class balancing and server issues.</div></div><hr />

It's great feature and I am going to use it for few character once it reaches EU. I rerolled lvl 30 male belf pally to lvl 55 female belf pally just to abbandon her and get back to my dwarf (in TBC, so sacrificing SoB for SoCom) because I couldn't bear the female model and cba to reroll the paladin again.

Firstly - it's maybe just set of pixels but don't lie to your pockets about how unimportant it is. Every single one of us here is addicted to the game, to the social relationships created amongst players AND characters. When you log into game, you don't play random pixel setting - you play your character.<br />
<br />
Second - company supplying some service decides to offer additive feature, for money. Whine all you want, but that's how market works - they offer something at certain price and it's up to you whether to accept the price or go look elsewhere. Besides, how much is 15USD really worth? I expect it to be 20 EUR when it reaches EU realms and that's... lemme look... 3 hours of my work or... going to cinema once less that week.</div></div><hr />

If it doesn't affect you or you aren't concerned about how your character looks, you would not be writing in this post.<br />
<br />
It's not like you need to take everything blizzard is implementing to you. Just like the barber shop, people did have some of the same thoughts on the case about why to implement such a thing.<br />
<br />
If I am allowed to be a complete ass, then either take this with a welcoming hand or leave it completely be, no one is forcing you to do it. Personally I think this feature will actually be a great addition to some people, some players are getting mocked (yes that is indeed childish but even it wow it happens) of their sex by playing female toons. Some players who're playing male toons may even find it interesting trying the opposite.<br />
<br />
On thoughts about this being a start-off for possible later additions to class change, it can't really be that bad tbh. Personally I would've prefered being able to change my class rather than making a new toon for every class I had to play. Such thing could give another feeling for casual players that they actually have something else to do than WoW.<br />
<br />
Seriously, if you think this is crap, leave it be and let people who find it interesting get their experience with it. It's fine to warn people that it could prove to be a money-maker for blizz and this should not become an addiction for anybody to feel they have to spend 150$ each month for new looks.</div></div><hr />

What I find humorous is that most people here instantly say &quot;You can't afford it waa waa&quot; - I can. That's not the issue here at all - it's a case of what I perceive to be value for money and if I were to ask many of the parents of the folks playing WoW whether they found 15-20e for cosmetic changes in a game to be &quot;good value for money&quot;, whadda'ya think they would say?<br />
<br />
Also the issue I have with it all is how this will affect other games in the future - EA is already rolling out their micro-payment system for the KOTOR mmo. Want a new hairstyle? $. Want a better lightsaber? $. <br />

How would all you &quot;this won't affect you!&quot; like when Blizzard introduces the same system to WoW? Sorry John, you can't afford this &quot;Authentic Sword of the Lich King 800dps&quot; but luckily Peter whose family is filthy rich can - now he's kicking your ass in all the bgs.<br />

As for the replies in the forums stating &quot;No we have no plans to introduce such a system&quot; - you might as well remember that they had no plans to introduce character customization a while back.</div></div><hr />

I think it's fairly obvious that parents would think it's a waste of money but what's that got to do with them? They won't pay for it if they don't want to, it's OPTIONAL.<br />

This whole buying loot idea has no relevance to the character customization, so please stop using it as an excuse to whinge.</div></div><hr />

I've been stuck with these poorly designed models for years now with my bones sticking out left right and center and shoulders that NEVER, EVER fit on the shoulders!!<br />
<br />
Finally now I can have the sexi undead female model and those badass casting anitmation along with the much, MUCH nicer fit on my gear.<br />
<br />
oh and imho £8-12 is about an hours work for me and seems fitting enough cost to make up for my mistake of not paying attention when creating my toons..<br />
<br />
But I do see what some people are saying.. why not have this as a feature ingame costing 10,20,50,100g or something on a 2month cooldown? clearly blizzard wants even more money.<br />
<br />
<br />
THEN AGAIN, developement time and money has been spent on making this and I guess it's only fitting that in the end the costs are covered by the people who use it rather then increasing the monthly supscription for everyone? I have been shock that in 3 years blizzard have no bumped up the price of the sup.</div></div><hr />

And i like my character's face very much :D Green Hair ( Druid afterall.. ), Ilidan Style Face Marks ( He was a Nelf :D ), Purple Skin ( WarCraft 3 Night Elf Style ;) and everything else..<br />
<br />
It saddens me that Blizzard has decided that they are not greedy enough. Atleast i hope the money goes into StarCraft 2/Diablo 3/Unnanounced Games :)<br />
<br />
I don't get you people :/ You made a decision: You took Gnome/Human/Tauren/Undead whateva, how can you not enjoy your character as it is? I love my Night Elf Druid very much, i can PWN in PvP, its green hair/purple skin/white eyes/green marks are from lore, and after all, its a DRUID, Best Class in everything it wants, once its maximized: Tanking ( Feral, Dire Bear Form ), 2x Healing ( Balance/Restoration Single Heals/Healing over Time Spells! ), Melee DPS ( Feral, Cat Form ), Caster DPS ( Balance, Human/Moonkin Form )<br />
<br />
&lt;3 Night Elves<br />
&lt;3 Druids<br />
&lt;/3 This Feature<br />
<br />
<br />
Wow you PWN in PvP because of your lore marks? :o Maybe we need to change our marks to fit some kind of lore so we can PWN too?!? <br />
<br />
Personally... I will give Blizz my $15 to make my Female Tauren a Male Tauren (70 Druid) even tho I shapeshift and I just look at my back anyway. It just hurts to look at it on the character selection screen lol... I don't what I was thinking making the (my opinion) ugliest character in the game...<br />
<br />
Call them greedy all you want but they are running a business. Do you call any/every business owner greedy for making a buck off you?</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is just a pure cosmetic change for $15. You can do most of it in the barbershop, except facial texture and skin tone.<br />
<br />
I can see them maybe adding race change in the future, but it will have two restrictions:<br />
1. must remain in your own faction<br />
2. target race must support your class<br />
<br />
So you won't see gnome druids or tauren warlocks.<br />
<br />
I have faith that Blizzard will never make it where people with more real-life money have a benefit over the poor. I think a lot of people are overreacting.<br />
<br />
Also, you'd think Horde people would love a Paid Race Change, as it would mean a lot less Blood Elves running around.<br />
<br />
Just like I bet you will start seeing less females-played-by-males with this current sex change operation.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Paid character at 55 / 65 decked in blues like DKs are? Just a matter of time in my humble oppinion. Restriction expected.<br />
<br />
Paid faction change? Sure, when they'll be running out of tricks. Should be limited to one per account though, or maybe character.</div></div><hr />

I wonder how it would work if not paid. Maybe like how us Bloodsails lost rep with BootyBay and the Steamwheedle Cartel, you start destroying all known Alliance or Horde rep. A long long grind to eventually for example... turn your Draenei Shaman into a Horde... again thru massive grinds... or not. <br />
<br />
You would then be maybe tied to the Taurens for example and such. But honestly... I doubt it would happen as everyone would prolly say... lets all go horde and the imbalance would be wild.<br />
<br />
As for sex changes... hmm.. I think thats gonna be fun to see nutjobs rant and QQ over, but honestly... if you impulsively made a Girl Avitar and now want it to be like your real person.. say a boy or vice versa... after all the grinding, rep farming and such. yeah... but the jokes will fly if you go from Boy to Girl.... <br />

Why thank you. <br />
<br />
I started playing over 3 years ago after getting WoW as a gift. I never planned on playing past the free trial, so I just randomized a character. That character is still my main, and I love everything about it except the skin color. It has annoyed me for years to the point where I'm almost obsessing about it. <br />
<br />
So why not just start a new character for free you ask? After all leveling is so easy now. That's true, but years of rep and whatnot isn't quite as easy to get back. There are feats I'd never be able to get, and quests I'd never be able to do. I have so much time invested in my character, so for me $15 to fix that one little thing that bugs me every time I log on is nothing.</div></div><hr />

thees do this and there is other for the game issues<br />
so even if they left done this it could not make the other issues solve any faster<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
solution, stop spending money as a company to develop crap like this and spend more money on people to fix issues and implement real content (like 3.1)</div></div><hr />

Blizzard are rich enough to spend money on developing both features. This does not affect the development of other features in any way, so no point in whining about it. (Whining about it just show how clueless you are when it comes to common knowledge like this)<br />
<br />
EDIT: And I've always loved the female tauren dance, now I could get a chance to do it myself if I want to!</div></div><hr />

I think it's good they didn't introduce sex change booths or something ingame and a it's payed service so it wouldn't really ruin the atmosphere at least.</div></div><hr />

Yes, they are rich, but they waste money (=people) on things like gender changes and for the 100th mount to design. Put those people on some real work and get the game done, that would be much more helpful.</div></div><hr />

Yupp, it's available now. And you will be delighted to learn that you are so priviledged that you have to pay €15 instead of $15 (which is about €10 in real terms).</div></div><hr />

Those things are, honestly, an afternoon's worth of work. Whether or not it is &quot;wasted&quot; work is subjective - many people in this thread would disagree with you.<br />
<br />
Game design, especially game balance, is something that is NOT improved by throwing more money or people at. The game will never be &quot;done&quot; - MMOs by nature aren't designed with the intent of being complete at any stage.</div></div><hr />
