World of Warcraft(R): Cataclysm(TM) in Stores Starting December 7<br />
<br />
IRVINE, Calif., Oct 04, 2010 (BUSINESS WIRE) — Blizzard Entertainment, Inc. today announced that World of Warcraft(R): Cataclysm(TM), the highly anticipated third expansion for the world's most popular subscription-based massively multiplayer online role-playing game*, will be released starting on December 7, 2010. The expansion will be available on DVD-ROM for Windows(R) XP/Windows Vista(R)/Windows(R) 7 and Macintosh(R) at a suggested retail price of $39.99 and will also be offered as a digital download from the Blizzard Store. A special Collector's Edition packed with bonus items will be available exclusively in retail stores for a suggested retail price of $79.99.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cataclysm includes the best content we've ever created for World of Warcraft. It's not just an expansion, but a re-creation of much of the original Azeroth, complete with epic new high-level adventures for current players and a redesigned leveling experience for those just starting out,&quot; said Mike Morhaime, CEO and cofounder of Blizzard Entertainment. &quot;With the help of our beta testers, we're putting on the final polish, and we look forward to welcoming gamers around the world to enjoy it in just a couple of months.&quot;<br />
<br />
The first two World of Warcraft expansions, The Burning Crusade(R) and Wrath of the Lich King(R), each shattered PC game sales records upon their release.* In Cataclysm, the face of Azeroth will be forever altered by the return of the corrupted Dragon Aspect Deathwing. Players will explore once-familiar areas of the world that have now been reshaped by the devastation and filled with new adventures. In an effort to survive the planet-shattering cataclysm, two new playable races — worgen and goblins — will join the struggle between the Alliance and the Horde. As players journey to the new level cap of 85, they'll discover newly revealed locations, acquire new levels of power, and come face to face with Deathwing in a battle to determine the fate of the world.<br />
<br />
The beta test for World of Warcraft: Cataclysm is currently underway.

They still have 2 months to tweak here and there. No need to panic.<br />
This expansion is already very late.</div></div><hr />

Hmm, cannot quite decide if I want to get the Collector's Edition, it has a lot of pretty cool stuff and the StarCraft 2 CE I got is pretty awesome. I'll probably just end up getting the normal edition, because $40 seems good, but I think charging double ($80) is a bit excessive.</div></div><hr />

Buy it online it will be cheaper becasue your not paying for the box and wasted paper.<br />
<br />
On a side note you wont ever need to install wow ever again after 4.0.1 comes out. You can download the initial 280 megs and the game will download around you while you play with a good connection. For me it only ads 100ms to my connection and its still green as it downloads. Its bad ass.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If I go to a store and buy WotLK, it will cost me $40. Or I can go to the Blizzard Store, buy the digital download, and it will STILL cost me $40.<br />
<br />
Cheaper how?<br />
<br />
Also, though the download may be available right away, the keys won't activate until 10AM on 12/7. So if you don't mind losing that 10 hours (assuming the servers are even going to be up) and you don't care about the CE, then the digital purchase is the way to go. Otherwise, you still need to get a physical copy.</div></div><hr />

Question though, if I buy the DVD version, I can 'upload' the game to my digital downloads, right? I have a bad habit of losing discs and although I recall doing this in the past I just wanna make sure. =/</div></div><hr />

<br />
What are you talking about? I got my copy of WotLK at midnight on release night and... I was playing it less than an hour later (it was way smoother than TBC's release night). There was minimal lag, minimal downtime and for the most part the only glitches I remember were a handful of quests that were bugged. When you're talking about a release that large I think they did an awesome job. I also purchased SC2 and did the digital download on the day of release. Again... no problems experienced.<br />
<br />
Also, where did you get your information on most of their staff being out until after New Years? I'm gonna guess that you're &quot;assuming&quot; that's the case which we all know is always highly accurate. December 7th may be an announcement to &quot;us&quot;, but I'm guessing the date has been known for quite a while internally and Blizzard is probably asking employees to keep vacation time to a minimum. Not every place closes for two weeks during the holidays, ya know.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The bulk of the expansion, the new 1-60 experience, is going to be available a few weeks before the box is out. That means there is time to fix old issues, giving them the ability to focus on 80-85 issues after official launch.<br />
<br />
As for me, not taking that week off. I would much rather have off in 4.0, to make one last run at the old content with the new levelling system. Might finally be able to stand levelling a paladin and a shaman then :)</div></div><hr />

The fact you think TERA Online is going to be good speaks volumes, last i checked TERA, the combat is as engaging as watching paint dry, you can't do shit solo, you must and will have to group all the fucking time from the start, the GRIND will be HORRIBLE seeing as its the old LINEAGE2 team making it, (hello 1 year of grinding before you reach max level if your lucky).</div></div><hr />

There's no QQ. I've been playing my Paladin since WoW release, throught all downs and highs - I dont have to listen to unqualified comments like yours, who're saying that I'm just another FOTM LK Paladin reroller.<br />
<br />
I wont spend more years in a char, just to get disappointed again, even thought, Hunter seems very attractive (you just QQ about the damage nerfs in the last builds, but you cant compare balancing to once again 0 new mechanics).<br />

I work til midnight on the 6th, then don't work again til 5 on the 7th. Guess I'll be going to wal-mart after work that monday. Maybe I can slip out early on the 6th to make a midnight launch.<br />
<br />
The digital download, do they piece it out like patches if you have that? Do you anticipate slow downloads and download server crashing if I try to d/l at midnight? I'd like to have the game ready to go when I get home at 12:30, if possible.</div></div><hr />

Unless you're either playing the korean open beta or in the NA/EU focused group tests your words have no value. :) I had the chance to play it at the GamesCom (nerdy private room ftw ^_^) and I got to 25 not even 8 hours. And just for your information, Bluehole Studio and En Masse Entertainment consists of developers of WoW, Diablo, Starcraft, Guild Wars, XBOX Live, Lineage, Aion and so on. And with corpartion with Nintendo (money says hello) I wont doubt it will set up a new standart for future MMO gameplay.</div></div><hr />

I'd take this hit without serious damage to my gaming experience, IF it didnt already happen in the past. Guess what, WotLK didnt have new skills or mechanics, too. All changes which happen now and happened in LK were for the sake of balancing - I dont see the Paladin getting anohter, cool and unique ability like the classes I quoted above.<br />

A couple weeks ago they said it would be available from the Blizzard Store at release, but not until 10AM on 12/7</div></div><hr />

I am having a blast with the new Holy Power system, plus the mini charge when applying judgments and all the procs definitely made it less FCFS and more of when to use what procs/holy power on which move at what time. Prot I haven't messed with much since I knew it was in deep development still, but it wasn't so bad either.<br />
<br />
I do however, having played them, see a lot of people raging and quitting, as were no longer 'simply' FCFS and 969, but that's fine, less 'full on paladins' for me :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
Cheaper how?<br />
<br />
Also, though the download may be available right away, the keys won't activate until 10AM on 12/7. So if you don't mind losing that 10 hours (assuming the servers are even going to be up) and you don't care about the CE, then the digital purchase is the way to go. Otherwise, you still need to get a physical copy.<br />
<br />
To me personally digital is just a lot less of a headache specially since there will be all these suckers installing while i download and play. Also people suck, why would I wait in line with 200+ of them? I meant in general games bought online are cheaper. Especially on steam, and EAstore.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Have you played the paladin class on the ptr yet or on beta if you were lucky. If you haven't you should try it. Paladins got tons of new stuff talent wise and the addition of holy power just makes the game even better due to new gameplay mechanics. Furthermore all the other classes who got the abilities you mentioned can't use them all at once and even if they did they aren't all that EPIC. <br />
<br />
Main is a balance druid. No trash for me no roar for me. Woot I got some crappy mushrooms which cast 1 at a time and have a range of 3 pro. Besides new eclipse which isn't all that bright, maybe a bit more rng friendly than old one, I get zilch in cata since they nerfed all the cool stuff they added. Does this mean I'm gonna take my toys and go home no cause I like my char and going to make it work with what I got. Plus cata is not only about class changes but the entire face of azeroth changes, that alone should make it worthwhile.</div></div><hr />

This just means the product has gone gold, ready for manufacturing. Blizzard still has 2 months of tuning, tweaking, bug squashing, etc. We'll get the final patch 4.0.3 on release date which is the finished product.

Doesn't have to mean it's gone gold. WOTLK only went gold 1 month before release. It just means they're on target and feel confident enough that they'll be ready. Could still be another month before they go gold.</div></div><hr />

I can't believe there are still people like you around. Why do your kind constantly fail to realize that they simply can not wait any longer? By the 7th of december, ICC has been running for a year. A YEAR.<br />
They've waited long enough, and even if the game isn't perfect by december 7th, they have to get it out.<br />
<br />
Also, i'm fairly the sales is not a factor when they think of a release date. If you plan on buying it, you will, no matter if it's christmas time or not. They want to release it when they feel it's needed/ready.</div></div><hr />

Way to be a complete retard. You completely contradict yourself in one post.

But erhm how is this digital download going to work. Can you download it before release? And do you have to pay before you can download or can you just download and pay afterwards for the key?</div></div><hr />

Why do your kind constantly fail to realize that they simply can not wait any longer? By the 7th of december, ICC has been running for a year. A YEAR.<br />
They've waited long enough, and even if the game isn't perfect by december 7th, they have to get it out.<br />
<br />
Also, i'm fairly the sales is not a factor when they think of a release date. If you plan on buying it, you will, no matter if it's christmas time or not. They want to release it when they feel it's needed/ready.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's ready when its ready&quot; HOw often have BLizzard said that? Dont tell me you mean - &quot;its ready when the right window to launch it without having properly tested it&quot;. Cause thats EXACTLY not what we need right now. The MMO industry is already filled with this thinking and WOW has done alot of things to try to avoid it.

<br />
If you expect quality from Blizzard you must be new to gaming. Wrath and Burning Crusade launch had some bugs,server crashes and lagged out the arse, previous patches like AQ and numerous other patches got so bad it crashed servers, when people say Casterclysm....they don't mean casters are gonna suck....no it means on the beta and ptr casters pretty much smoke melee in pve and pvp....you know what Blizzard and Ghost Crawler are gonna say *drum roll* &quot;Working as intended&quot;.<br />
<br />
As for the Amazon release date a few days ago, they seriously need to not try and act they have &quot;sources&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Cities: Darnassus hasn't changed at all, except for a worgen area being carved out. Orgrimmar looks 1000x better then all other Vanilla cities now! Stormwind has recieved some nice changes here and there, but didn't recieve the structural love that Org did which sucks. <br />
<br />
Durotar Orc starting zone is sadly the same with just better flow. <br />
<br />
*Ashazara is one the best zones in this expansion. Stonetalon, Redridge, Westfall, Hillsbrad, Tirisfal Glades seem to be some of the other zones that are quite impressive.<br />
<br />
Darkshore rehashed certain subzones and used old quests here and there, but mostly is new. I just didn't like the quest flow in it at all, and it wasn't as impressive as I had hoped it would be.<br />
<br />
Forsaken leveling experience is almost completely new and probably one of the best over all changed leveling expereiences<br />
<br />
Human starting zone has new quests, but Elwynn has not been changed much at all. It has slightly better flow however.<br />
<br />
Some zones have not changed much in the old world when it comes to quests while other basically have recieved a much bigger overhaul. If the game launches with these mostly rehashed zones using years old quests that make no sense with the 'years later' up to date model then BLizzard is being lazy. Not saying you shouldn't buy it, cause there are tons of great changes. But honestly I would have thought they could do better then this. <br />
<br />
Overall:<br />
<br />
The new glyph system isn't anything to write home about and currently feels way less impressive then their prior idea Path of the Titans. The new talent trees are fun at first, but later don't amount to much especially since they feel restrictive (the whole point of talent trees was to allow 'unique' customization of your character). The new way quests are received and picked up feels more restrictive then ever. You can't just choose to skip an area on a zone and level in another area in the same zone, because the quests require you to do an entire zone to get a breadcrumb to another zone. Five end game zones in Cata compared to ten in Nothrend kind stinks also imo.<br />
Quests are also at times just rehashed versions of vanilla quests or are the exact same. Itemization appears to be better however. I am not saying the entire expansion is bad, but these are strictly things in my opinion which altered the game too much for me and others like me. <br />
However this is worth buying if only for the Guild Perks (which rock!), the new secondary profession Archeology, Leveling a Goblin or Worgen, Deepholme (easily one of the best high level zones in the game), flying in azeroth, and the new difficulty of dungeons. The rated battlegrounds and arena might have people rushing into these to get high level epic gear for raids as well, but rated battlegrounds with ranks again is another reason to buy.</div></div><hr />

If StarCraft II is any indicator you'll be able to download the client beforehand, and the the installer will unlock at 10AM pacific time. So, if you want it right at midnight (or a collector's edition), your best bet is probably a pre-order and midnight release at your local brick and mortar. But, this is all assuming things which we haven't release any information about.<br />
<br />
I'd wait for more info... like... a release date. ;) <br />
<br />
Not definitive, but pretty damn close, since it is coming from a Blue. Midnight releases at stores make up way too much marketing buzz for them to let people pre-download and activate at midnight. If they did that there would be no reason at all for anyone who wasn't getting a collector's edition to go to a midnight release.</div></div><hr />

While I don't like the posters who brag about &quot;blizzard not getting their money,&quot; this argument is just wrong. It is very like that the lull in content caused a very significant number of subscriptions to lapse. And this *is* how consumerism works. The company suffers a profit loss due to an inability to deliver product. Arguing that they aren't making *as much* money is invalid. When the chart goes down, CEOs are unhappy. <br />
<br />
But, Blizzard's charts didn't go down. They went up. You see, they cleverly released another multimillion dollar game in that lull.</div></div><hr />

Why did everyone assume that'd be the &quot;big announcement&quot; at Blizzcon? I for one think that this years Blizzcon isn't going to emphasize WoW, but Diablo3.

<br />
Well he is right, you want to stop playing and paying do it no one cares, not even blizzard. The time that they are releasing content and the next xpac is perfectly fine. It feels slow but thats how it always feels when you run out of things to do, you just want something new. They couldn't just release it 3 months earlier or 2, it wasn't ready yet, and there are still lots of guild that have not finished the current content. And just because they haven't don't go calling them failures.<br />
<br />
Bottom line, no one cares that you stopped paying, we don't need to know, we don't care. We know why people do it.</div></div><hr />

I've honestly used digital download twice, and both times it was working fine for me, but that wasn't with another 2 million and a few other people hammering the blizz servers trying to get the game.<br />
<br />
I'd say it'd download as quick as a patch (p2p connection) on patch day, so test the 4.0.1 patch 4-5gb download and see how long that takes.<br />

Most of the staff will be out til after New Year, there's bound to be some issues - while Blizzard is awesome, their track record with deployments has been absolutely awful for the past couple of years.<br />

Wrath was smooth as silk chief.</div></div><hr />

<br />
An Operation: Gnomeregan announcement featured a quote from Mekkatorque's combat medical advisor, stating the likelihood of a cataclysmic event happening was less than 12.7%.<br />

<br />
Now either 12.7% = 12/7 is a really huge coincidence, or...</div></div><hr />

Another two months of respite and mindless superheroan~ in CoH. After an eternity of ICC and DPS meters and the same stupidity over and over and over again, it'll be nice to take a break and parade around in smashing tights beating up muggers and come back to a completely fresh, new game, even if the husband and I can't initially afford Cata. (Eighty bucks, even for a digital download, can still make the budget pinch in between the groceries and household bills when in this job market only one of us is working.)<br />
<br />
It's good to hear it officially, though.</div></div><hr />
