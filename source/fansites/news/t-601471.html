Mages<br />
Aeus made a post concerning mage's Evocation skill on the ... mage forum. <br />
Among some of the suggestions we have forwarded was also the question of evocate and basically “what’s up with that?”<br />
<br />
To answer the question:<br />
We feel evocate is working as it is intended: it’s simply highly dependent on how much spirit the mage has.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, many mages seem not to like spirit that much and would rather spend their gem slots and enchants on other stats. This is fine, everyone has the freedom to choose what stats they want to focus on.<br />
<br />
Whereas in the past we forced a lot of spirit onto the mage's tier sets so that they would have good mana regen, to leave more room for flexibility and choice we have replaced a lot of that spirit with gem slots in recent gear.<br />
<br />
Website<br />
Updates are still going, I'll try to add dungeon sets 3 to the Armor Showroom today and see if I can fix the problem with images not showing for some people. It seems that the new tooltips are working fine for everyone and it might speed up a few things. ^^</div></div><hr />

<br />
get &quot;evocation2&quot; addon<br />
get a great spirit staff (best is nightbane healing staff) + 20 spirit enchant (=75 spirit)<br />
get a green wand from auctioneer house with some spirit<br />
<br />
put those weapons in your bags while fighting<br />
<br />
<br />
whenever you get evocation buff or innervate buff, <br />
the addon chances automatically your weapons for more spirit for the duration of this buff<br />
after that, it puts back weapons you had before<br />
<br />
<br />
for example:<br />
i am using prince dagger and heroic offhand + wand with no spirit<br />
while in evocation /innervate, i get 75+15 spirit = 90 spirit. <br />
evocation result is ~1500 mana more, while in bossfights</div></div><hr />

LOL, is this some kind of a sick joke?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hey I know! Let me totally gimp myself so I can evocate better.<br />
<br />
Morons.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">astros</div><div class="date">2007-07-05, 03:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You know what pisses me off about mages...they expect us to focus on like 10 different stats...<br />
<br />
1) intellect<br />
2) spell damage<br />
3) spell crit<br />
4) spell hit<br />
5) and now spirit?<br />
6) and forget about stamina, because when you focus on all these other necessary stats, you get a whooping 6-7k health....<br />
<br />
<br />
now lets look at warlocks for example....they can pretty much only focus on 2 basic stats<br />
1) spell damage<br />
2) stamina <br />
3) throw in a little spell hit<br />
4) yep thats it, who needs intellect or spirit when you can just life tap off of your ungodly amount of 10k+ health.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Donkbet</div><div class="date">2007-07-05, 03:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just make evoc restore a static % of your mana pool, like 65-70% or something. Then it becomes a useful but not OP skill. Blizzard I just did all of your thinking for you, you're welcome.</div></div><hr />
