Bungie posted today (https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/47569) that they are regaining publishing rights for Destiny.<br />
When we first launched our partnership with Activision in 2010, the gaming industry was in a pretty different place. As an independent studio setting out to build a brand new experience, we wanted a partner willing to take a big leap of faith with us. We had a vision for Destiny that we believed in, but to launch a game of that magnitude, we needed the support of an established publishing partner.<br />
<br />
With Activision, we created something special. To date, Destiny has delivered a combination of over 50 million games and expansions to players all around the world. More importantly, we’ve also witnessed a remarkable community – tens of millions of Guardians strong – rise up and embrace Destiny, to play together, to make and share memories, and even to do truly great things that reach far beyond the game we share, to deliver a positive impact on people’s everyday lives.<br />
<br />
We have enjoyed a successful eight-year run and would like to thank Activision for their partnership on Destiny. Looking ahead, we’re excited to announce plans for Activision to transfer publishing rights for Destiny to Bungie. With our remarkable Destiny community, we are ready to publish on our own, while Activision will increase their focus on owned IP projects.<br />
<br />
The planned transition process is already underway in its early stages, with Bungie and Activision both committed to making sure the handoff is as seamless as possible.<br />
<br />
With Forsaken, we’ve learned, and listened, and leaned in to what we believe our players want from a great Destiny experience. Rest assured there is more of that on the way. We’ll continue to deliver on the existing Destiny roadmap, and we’re looking forward to releasing more seasonal experiences in the coming months, as well as surprising our community with some exciting announcements about what lies beyond.<br />
<br />
Thank you so much for your continued support. Our success is owed in no small part to the incredible community of players who have graced our worlds with light and life. We know self-publishing won’t be easy; there’s still much for us to learn as we grow as an independent, global studio, but we see unbounded opportunities and potential in Destiny. We know that new adventures await us all on new worlds filled with mystery, adventure, and hope. We hope you’ll join us there.<br />
<br />
See you starside.<br />
<br />

Not that simple, Bungie was still a separate entity. Blizzard Entertainment as a company no longer exists, they're not &quot;owned by Activision&quot; they are wholly a PART of the Activision Blizzard company. All the devs could break off and form their own company, but they would lose all the IP that is owned by ActiBlizz as well as the ability to use Blizzard as a namesake.</div></div><hr />

They relinquished publishing rights to future games, they're still the publisher of D2 though. D2 isn't going anywhere, but D3 (if there is one) won't be on the launcher.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think we're missing the writing on the wall here. Bungie isn't fighting to get back publishing rights to Destiny. Instead, Activision is cutting Destiny.<br />
<br />
Activision is the publisher. As such, their sole responsibility is profiting off of the games they publish. Destiny 2 has been a rough ride since it's release. Forsaken was meant to be a resurgence since they even gave away the base game to lure people in, but that hasn't worked out as planned.<br />
<br />
That's not to say this isn't a great thing. Bungie's biggest influencer will be out of the picture, so they can get back to making a great game in their own right.</div></div><hr />

<br />
How do you propose they &quot;leave&quot;, when ATVI owns them, outright? They'd have to buy the company from ATVI, and ATVI would have to be willing to sell. <br />
<br />
I'm sure it would only cost 40, 50 billion dollars to buy themselves out. That'll happen. <br />
<br />
Blizzard is a massive chunk of ATVI's income, they're not going anywhere.</div></div><hr />

They didn't have that with Morhaime. They are owned 100% by ATVI.</div></div><hr />

No it isn't. Activision Blizzard is a holding company that owns both Activision and Blizzard that was formed when Activision merged with Vivendi Games.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I heard that Bungie was the one to come up with some of the monetization. I also heard that Activision initially wasn't interfering with how they ran the game at all, so it's all on Bungie how the game turned out in the first place.<br />
<br />
What I'm saying is, I'd be cautious about anything new Bungie makes until we can absolutely confirm that things have changed. Time will tell how much of Destiny 2's mediocrity was Actiblizz, and how much the devs being incompetent.<br />
<br />
<br />
Please let this be a fucking sign. I know the odds are so so incredibly negligable, but if this proves companies can split away from activision, then maybe, just maybe there's a CHANCE of getting the real blizzard back.<br />
<br />
The &quot;real Blizzard&quot; has been gone for a while now. It's not in the company name, which hasn't been an independent entity since 2008 when Activision pretty much acquired Blizzard from Vivendi in the merger. It's in all the old guard who had been steadily leaving the studio over the last few years. There's hardly anybody left of the crew that made those first expansions to WoW. As if to demonstrate just how deep the merger runs, Activision had a CEO of their choosing take over operations on the Blizzard side of things(with the immediate first few words out of his mouth being &quot;We're cutting costs&quot;).</div></div><hr />

No. Destiny will just not be on there for future titles.<br />
<br />
Destiny 2 is still an Activision published product.<br />
<br />
As for people thinking Blizzard can just buy themselves out too.... you clearly have never had experience in the business/financial industry.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Bungie hasn't split away from ATVI. They simply ended a publishing deal over one title - they have a 10 year publishing deal overall that ends in 2020. <br />
<br />
Bungie is an independent company that bought itself from Microsoft, it's previous owner.<br />
<br />
Blizzard is owned 100% ATVI. They can't &quot;split away&quot; from ATVI, unless they buy themselves out, or someone else buys them. And, Blizzard publishes it's own titles, always has, so to &quot;split away&quot; from ATVI, they'd publish games with another company...why? It simply isn't going to happen. There's no reason for it, even if they could legally do that, why would they send a percentage of the profits to someone else, when they get all if it, now?<br />
<br />
Bungie's deal with Activision has NOTHING to do with Blizzard, and they're doing something Blizzard literally in ever sense cannot do.</div></div><hr />

Except there's strong news for them today, they finally replaced the CEO at Activision, and King got a new CFO. Investors love hearing that kind of thing.<br />
<br />
There's definitely some things going down, but Bungie isn't &quot;leaving&quot;, they were never &quot;there&quot;, they've been privately owned NOT by ATVI since they bought themselves from Microsoft. They have a publishing deal. That's it. <br />
<br />
And, they're still hiring a LOT of dev positions at Blizzard. Do a little fact checking sometimes.</div></div><hr />

There's definitely some things going down, but Bungie isn't &quot;leaving&quot;, they were never &quot;there&quot;, they've been privately owned NOT by ATVI since they bought themselves from Microsoft. They have a publishing deal. That's it. <br />
<br />
And, they're still hiring a LOT of dev positions at Blizzard. Do a little fact checking sometimes.<br />
<br />
Mike Morhaime severing all ties with Blizzard is a shocker. After hours trading is looking bad. Down to 47 after ending at 51</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gadzooks</div><div class="date">2019-01-10, 10:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I heard that Bungie was the one to come up with some of the monetization. I also heard that Activision initially wasn't interfering with how they ran the game at all, so it's all on Bungie how the game turned out in the first place.<br />
<br />
What I'm saying is, I'd be cautious about anything new Bungie makes until we can absolutely confirm that things have changed. Time will tell how much of Destiny 2's mediocrity was Actiblizz, and how much the devs being incompetent.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The &quot;real Blizzard&quot; has been gone for a while now. It's not in the company name, which hasn't been an independent entity since 2008 when Activision pretty much acquired Blizzard from Vivendi in the merger. It's in all the old guard who had been steadily leaving the studio over the last few years. There's hardly anybody left of the crew that made those first expansions to WoW. As if to demonstrate just how deep the merger runs, Activision had a CEO of their choosing take over operations on the Blizzard side of things(with the immediate first few words out of his mouth being &quot;We're cutting costs&quot;).<br />
<br />
Nonsense.<br />
<br />
Blizzard hasn't been independent for almost it's entire history. They changed the name of the company to Blizzard when Davidson and Associates bought them. They have been owned the entire time they've been making their iconic games. The only games Blizzard released as an independent company were Lost Vikings and Rock N Roll Racing, as Chaos. <br />
<br />
There were 3 founders of Blizzard. 2 of them are still at Blizzard. The original crew of Wow have moved on, but that happens to most games - and a large number of them are still working on the game, they're just not names you know. Chilton, Afrasiabi, many of the old school guys are still around. People move on. Blizzard, until this last year, were known for hanging onto people way longer than is typical in the game industry, where people job hop a lot. And, one of the founders, Allen Adham, came back. <br />
<br />
And yes, ATVI hired Brack. That's one of the perks you get when you own a company. <br />
<br />
The fairy tales that get posted in threads like this are hilarious - and kind of sad and pathetic at this point.</div></div><hr />

<br />
they were tbh,just like how they cut 80% of D1's story a month before launch to sell as DLC,they cut 66% of D2's story to sell as DLC<br />
<br />
They also forced microtransactions and the season pass format into the game<br />
<br />
And when they loosened a bit their grip on Bungie,we got Forsaken,which is a genuinely great expansion and adds a lot to the game<br />
<br />
All in all,Bungie being able to handle their own stuff is going to help Destiny a lot,though a lot of harm has been done since a lot of the big names from Bungie either left or got fired</div></div><hr />

<br />
No. This gets posted constantly, and here we go again.<br />
<br />
There are multiple companies in the mix here.<br />
<br />
Activision Blizzard is the parent company. I refer to them as ATVI, because that's their stock symbol. They own all of the other companies under discussion. The entire purpose of ATVI is to own other companies, which is why it's defined as a parent company, and holding company. They have their own offices, and staff. <br />
<br />
Blizzard Inc, a game publisher and studio, is owned by ATVI. They have their own offices, and staff. <br />
<br />
Activision Publishing, which publishes games made by studios it owns or has deals with, is owned by ATVI. They have their own offices, and staff. <br />
<br />
King Gaming, which makes Candy Crush, is owned by ATVI. They have their own offices, and staff. <br />
<br />
If you work for Blizzard, your paycheck says &quot;Blizzard, Inc.&quot;, not &quot;Activision-Blizzard&quot;. <br />
<br />
The are distinct legal, financial, and managerial reasons for these distinctions. Blizzard Inc. exists, as does Activision Publishing. They are not one and the same with ATVI. When Activision Publishing merged with Vivendi, Bobby Kotick stepped down as CEO of Activision Publishing, and took on the new role of CEO of ATVI, which was formed to hold the companies that were joined in ownership in the merger. They could have called the parent company &quot;Activision-Vivendi&quot;, just as easily, but the assets that mattered were the Activision and Blizzard companies - the merger also transferred ownership of Sierra Online to ATVI, and was subsequently shut down, for all intents. <br />
<br />
This happens all of the time in other industries. Go look at who Nestle owns, for instance. Nestle owns many, many subsidiaries, some that operate just like Blizzard does, under their ownership. Blizzard Inc. is a self-contained unit, business-wise - they make and publish their own games, and it makes much more sense to keep it that way, regardless of who owns it - and up until the last couple of years, were doing a pretty good job.</div></div><hr />

There are no &quot;shares&quot; of Blizzard. Blizzard is owned 100% by ATVI. It has nothing to do with structure - they own the entire company. And will continue to own it, unless they decide to sell it, or shut it down, like they did with Sierra.</div></div><hr />

Think of a president and a studio driven by developers and WoW fans like Ion or Allen, that NOT has to serve shareholders and follow the new financial aspected leads (see Variety article), but instead are free to do what THEY think its best for the game and the dedicated fans. Instead whats best for the quarter numbers and profit.<br />

Not that simple, Bungie was still a separate entity. Blizzard Entertainment as a company no longer exists, they're not &quot;owned by Activision&quot; they are wholly a PART of the Activision Blizzard company. All the devs could break off and form their own company, but they would lose all the IP that is owned by ActiBlizz as well as the ability to use Blizzard as a namesake.<br />

<br />
Bungie's relationship with ATVI is entirely different than Blizzard's. I'm not even going to explain it because you clearly don't want to know but it's been explained about a billion times over the last couple of years.<br />
<br />
You could read post #61 in this thread. That explains it pretty well.<br />
<br />
Second thought: There's a remarkable lack of awareness that all of this could very well be kabuki theater for ATVI turning loose a studio that released an underperforming sequel to a major title. ATVI severs relations with Bungi two years early and allows Bungi to save face. It's possible.</div></div><hr />

exactly this.<br />
<br />
i only disagree to last part, since its totally normal that the shareholders of parent company offer expectations for the sub companies, which leads to „directions“. ofc the subs acting on their own, make their descisions and design on their own. but if parent company wants a slightly change in „direction“, they will do.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To die a slow death the game was less popular than overwatch which was a brand new ip with new character. Heroes on the other hand had free advertising from other games character but still failed. Heroes is a shit tier game that needs a rework to be succesful. The problem with heroes is that blizzard is in love with heavily team based games nobody who plays a moba like the team aspect or at least the majority.<br />

They need to just revert the game back to mop add new dungeons and mythic+ and everything would be gravy. It was the last time pvp was fun because there was actual counterplay to everything but the aids that was hammer of justice. I seriously hopes it removed from the game next expansion fucking cancerous spell.<br />

It we'll it's just a mobile pc. There nothing stopping mobiles games from getting the graphical settings and controls of pc but hardware and design issues. Mobile game we'll be killed by virutal gaming. The computer is just evolving honestly.<br />

They have separate values now but there is nothing stopping mobile gaming from taking every advantage pc has. Hardware is hitting a development wall.

Yea in our lifetime lol well mine, I'm only in my 20's. To think we won't see mobile device catch up with pc in the next 20 years laughter worthy. Computer hardware is already about to transform because there only few more modern ways to improve it. Like better coding and die shrinks.<br />

We can also use cloud streaming to get around the hardware limitation of mobile devices. Having a power pc drive a bunch of funs at max settings for much cheaper. We have a lot cool alternatives actually.<br />

It won't die in my lifetime because we are our stereotypical parents from back in the day, there's far too large of a community of PC people to let it die until WE die off.

You can change the hardware in the phones though even build your own. With manufactuars parts or kickstarter projects. I guess it won't completely die but defiantly stagnate and reach life support levels.</div></div><hr />

Nah you can get decent settings but not the best hardware yet and I'm only 27. Mobile gaming is gonna overtake pc in my lifetime and that's because it address actual problems with pc gaming. Cost and Availbility. We're also headedd towards self improving Ai and nobody knows how much that is gonna speed up technology.<br />

https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/3/17422410/bungie-netease-100-million-investment-china-destiny-business<br />
In the end, it's all in the same hands, this is just PR in action because, look at the positivity of the comments.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kussie</div><div class="date">2019-01-11, 03:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">they were tbh,just like how they cut 80% of D1's story a month before launch to sell as DLC,they cut 66% of D2's story to sell as DLC<br />
<br />
They also forced microtransactions and the season pass format into the game<br />
<br />
And when they loosened a bit their grip on Bungie,we got Forsaken,which is a genuinely great expansion and adds a lot to the game<br />
<br />
All in all,Bungie being able to handle their own stuff is going to help Destiny a lot,though a lot of harm has been done since a lot of the big names from Bungie either left or got fired<br />
<br />
Ahhh no not at all.<br />
<br />
First and foremost Activision didn't own Bungie, Bungie had complete control over their games and what into them. A lot of the MTX and especially Everspace was an idea from and added by Bungie themselves which they have admitted to (https://www.pcgamesn.com/destiny-2/destiny-2-reboot-jason-schreier). They could not continuously meet the deadlines they agreed to with Activision for the release of DLC, and everspace was their way of trying to drip feed content so more time could be spent on bigger DLC packs. Mostly due to their pool dev tools if i recall.<br />
<br />
As for the cutting of the content from D1 and D2, you just need to look at Bungies history to see that this is a common occurrence with them. D1 and D2 both got complete reboots around just over a year out from release at the behest of Bungie management (https://www.pcgamesn.com/destiny-2/destiny-2-reboot-jason-schreier). If you look back at the Halo days, remember Halo was originally and RTS, then a third person shooter until MS got involved with them.<br />
<br />
Bungie butted heads with MS, and butted heads with Activision who is the common party in this so far?<br />
<br />
Not saying that Activision is a saint and faultless in a lot of ways. But in the case of Bungie, they don't exactly have the best history of management behind the curtains at all. But to say everything wrong with the Destiny series is because of Activision is out right wrong.</div></div><hr />

You can do streaming for pc but if it done on phones that's another bonus.<br />
<br />
We can even use computers to stream high-end graphics to a phone for a monthly fee rather than the 1.2k to 1.5k it would take to get a high-end pc capable of 4k or better. It's about 1-2k to 1.5k when you factor in monirtors.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Even if by some miracle they could leave (which they can't), the answer is no. The staff we remember of years past as Blizzard have slowly vanished. The only commonality they share is a name - a name that is now just a hollow shell.<br />
<br />
We are essentially witnessing the gradual fall of a titan developer.<br />
<br />
I doubt we will ever really see an incredible Warcraft/Starcraft/Diablo game ever again. Any future releases will simply be to make a quick buck, amazing IPs destined to become the teets from which Acti-Blizzard milk from until they wither away.</div></div><hr />

Cost, availability, hardware compability, and maintenances. I mean I hate updating windows it just move stuff around for no goddamn reason. I just have a laptop for doing unsafe exploring and pc I never update now.<br />

You can get a 1080p phone for like 100 dollars while the pc version of that is like 400+.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A 100 dollar phone is not going to be close to 1080p gaming at any valuable aspect. We have a long way to go before Mobile graphics overtake PC and Console graphics, and even then they'll be prohibitively expensive off the bat. I don't even know what you mean by &quot;availability&quot;. Maintenance sure, but you have to update your phone too, and sometimes that kills your apps. Hardware compatibility is basically a non-issue.<br />
<br />
Benefits of PC gaming (and console)? Better graphics for a LONG time, better game availability, the ability to play comfortably without staring at a tiny screen (we are also a long way off from decent, computer/console graphics streamed to your tv). And many other things. If you don't like PC gaming, play a console. Longevity (when you buy one you know you won't have to replace for a long time and every game will work), comfort, and control.<br />
<br />
To say Mobile gaming will &quot;kill&quot; console and pc (which have both increased, not decreased) is laughable.</div></div><hr />

You can play a pc while in transit or heading back to the house. It is badly my amd drivers have crashed hardcore in certain games to the point, I've needed to wait for patches just to play. I have like 50 more years left on this earth all of those problems we'll be solved before, I die for sure. Also pc hardware is hitting limits. The new cpu gains are like 1-2% in games. Graphic cards have like 5-10 years left before they need a rework or reimagining. <br />
<br />
Mobile gaming is already out growing them and once the graphic and control issues are addressed it will take even more. I can see something like virutal glasses that allow you to project a bigger screen be a solution all of this is possible in 20 years or less. Something else might take mobile gaming down as well. Like virtual hardware but that's like 20+ years off.<br />
<br />
Like glasses that allow you to see the game but your peripheral vision is uneffected, so you can still interact witht he outside world.<br />
<br />
The advantage outside of business related stuff is shrinking because of a lack of cpu gains unless something changes. Cpu are about to be replace by graphics cards it's why intel hired Raji the amd graphics head guy. They want to leave a potentially dying market.<br />

<br />
So you'd rather them have put a TBC zone in Vanilla and then had 1 less zone in TBC?<br />
<br />
Literally that's what would have happened. Or Vanilla would have had to be delayed to fit all of Outland in because only one zone was ever known/fleshed out with basics. Or even worse the game would have possibly launched without MC as Kaplan said they finished that entire raid within a week from what they had to work with.<br />
<br />
And they didn't throw the zone away. They used said zone with a huge asset rework for an expansion. Which was smarter. They saved an asset for somewhere where it could be better applied.<br />
<br />
And if you think it's BS that games reuse assets well it's been a thing since the Atari days. It means games take less time to develop and don't usually lose any noticeable quality for it.</div></div><hr />

No I'm saying cutting content isn't greed but sometimes idea don't workout. A bunch of people we're bitching about resued content which ever game does. The prison raid in cata was suppose to be a raid near stockades that the horde would have to fight alliance to access but they didn't have time to finish it. Emerald dream was also suppose to be in vanilla but it was cut because the phasing technology wasn't ready at the time. Grim batol was another instance that was removed from vanilla and added later. No non-retarded company throws out nearly finished ideas that the defintion of retarded.<br />
<br />
Every game with a sequel has reused and updated old unfinished ideas but people were criticizing bungie for this because research is hard.</div></div><hr />

Cutting content has been a thing for 30 years though. Maybe more.<br />
<br />
It's a completely normal part of game development.<br />
<br />
Also I'd like to see a source that says Grim Batol was intended for Vanilla. <br />

As for the Emerald Dream zone we knew barely anything about it. And there were barely any assets used for it. Again didn't seem like a huge loss.<br />

It's more that Bungie flipped those assets into the story and made a very pitiful story to go with them basically.<br />

Nah they had tech demo at blizzcon for it but they couldn't finish it like dance studio. So it was cut but dance studio was straight up cancelled.<br />

It was a zone with a locked gated that needed a key with elite mobs. It was assumed a dungeon or raid was suppose to take place there but it was cut because of time.<br />

The rest of it is just conjecture. Btw, intel wants to get INTO the GPU market (its a huge market) not get OUT OF the CPU mark. GPU's aren't taking over CPUs, your phone has &quot;both&quot; in them, it's called SOC, system on chip. There's still a cpu and a gpu.</div></div><hr />

I know and the switch and consoles are just limited computer. This is pc gaming just taking another form which was my point.<br />
<br />
Also the 10% source on the 10% gain that usual only for apps the real world avg gaming difference is normally 1-2% and not worth upgrading for. PCIE 4 means nothing if graphics cards can't use it. There are no graphics cards that are bottlenecked by pcie 3.0 atm.<br />

<br />
First and foremost Activision didn't own Bungie, Bungie had complete control over their games and what into them. A lot of the MTX and especially Everspace was an idea from and added by Bungie themselves which they have admitted to (https://www.pcgamesn.com/destiny-2/destiny-2-reboot-jason-schreier). They could not continuously meet the deadlines they agreed to with Activision for the release of DLC, and everspace was their way of trying to drip feed content so more time could be spent on bigger DLC packs. Mostly due to their pool dev tools if i recall.<br />
<br />
As for the cutting of the content from D1 and D2, you just need to look at Bungies history to see that this is a common occurrence with them. D1 and D2 both got complete reboots around just over a year out from release at the behest of Bungie management (https://www.pcgamesn.com/destiny-2/destiny-2-reboot-jason-schreier). If you look back at the Halo days, remember Halo was originally and RTS, then a third person shooter until MS got involved with them.<br />
<br />
Bungie butted heads with MS, and butted heads with Activision who is the common party in this so far?<br />
<br />
Not saying that Activision is a saint and faultless in a lot of ways. But in the case of Bungie, they don't exactly have the best history of management behind the curtains at all. But to say everything wrong with the Destiny series is because of Activision is out right wrong.<br />
<br />
But it's a pretty known fact that Activision demanded that the story for D1 was rewritten to accomodate for the DLCs about a month before release,about the same time they decided to replace all of Marty O'Donnel's music with more generic stuff as it was &quot;more accessible&quot; (and more or less threw him under a bus at the same time)<br />
That's how we ended up with a senseless rushed story for D1</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Corroc</div><div class="date">2019-01-11, 12:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Its interesting how clueless people are from what actually happened. Bungie had no way of ending the contract from their end. Activision wasn't making as much money as they wanted with Destiny 2 even with microtransactions that were actually implemented by Bungie themself. You read that right. When activision made the contract with Bungie, Bungie wanted to add Eververse to D2 themself as part of the contract for making more income/content. <br />
Everyone has been reading the financial management changes with Activision so it doesn't come as a suprise that Activision wants to cut ties with Destiny 2 since its not making the investors happy. So why would Bungie then agree to cut ties with Activision if its financing the game? Because Bungie has had alot of trouble providing good content in the schedule that they originally agreed with Activision. They felt like they had to do too much content too fast. This was basically new title and 2 DLC's a year.</div></div><hr />

I mean almost everything you stated are false. Hots was not a failure, Hots was a failure because it was Blizzards game. Any other company would give their left nut to have the third biggest moba on the market. <br />
<br />
Claiming that people who play moba's don't like teamplay is just stupid man. Its a god damn team game, all of them are. However, I do agree that it was advertised wrong and they should have focused more on competitive play. Blizzard is not in love with teamplay, they are in love with casual play, which is what killed hots.(apart from activisions failures that forces them to cut cost) <br />
<br />
Even after they gutted the esports scene it is many many many times bigger than the closest competitor and if you don't compare with League it still have a very healthy player base(Not that i cannot be felt that 50% of the good players left overnight)<br />
<br />
Your response is the classic reasoning that anyone who never got into hots give about hots. Heroes of the Storm is a very misunderstood game that is honestly the best Blizzard has produced since Vanilla Wow.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard IS Activision so they can't just leave like Bungie. <br />
<br />
However, I am keeping my hopes up. A split has to be at least suggested by investors considering how bad PR has gotten since Activision's involvement and stock prices. Keep voting with your wallet. As long as Activision gouges Blizzard and continues to run it into the ground, it will have people that matter hoping for a change.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Activision says how much bungie has to earn with Destiny 2. Do you think that Evermore Store disaster was because Bungie wanted to abuse their players? I dont think so... the investors/Publishers say what you have to do. They may not say exactly WHAT you have to do but you have to meet the expectations of the Publisher/Investors. And we all now that Publishers (EA/Activision especially) are the cancer in the gaming industry. THEY are the reason for the pay2win lootboxes/mtx that went totally out of controll because of their greediness.</div></div><hr />

Why bash someone instead of just talking about the talking points? You made mistakes yourself. It is &quot;God&quot; not god. Deities are always capitalized. Your use of the comma after &quot;time&quot; was incorrect as well. It would sound like Please then maybe. It should have been Please educate yourself then the comma. Let us not forget about the end of your rant. &quot;I think you're confusing moba&quot; should be &quot;the moba genre&quot;. Call of Duty isn't a genre either. That would be the FPS genre. <br />
<br />
Worry about your own grammatical prowess before you bash others for no reason, k kiddo? This way, in the future, you won't look like a jack ass while downing others.<br />

Please let this be a fucking sign. I know the odds are so so incredibly negligable, but if this proves companies can split away from activision, then maybe, just maybe there's a CHANCE of getting the real blizzard back.<br />

Good on Bungie. If they don't pull the greedy bullshit once they're seperated with their next installment or game, then I have high hopes for them.<br />
<br />
Why do people keep parroting this shit?<br />
<br />
Activision didn't walk up to blizzard and tell them &quot;yea I think you should put the azerite armor system into BfA&quot; or &quot;KEK! GATE FLYING BEHIND CHIEVEMENTS dur!!&quot;.<br />
<br />
Come on maaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaan. Blizzard has to meet certain criteria and numbers. We all get that, but blizzard is responsible for their own design and systems in game. Period. They make the call on what to put in when and where.</div></div><hr />

I said they'd need to spin-off the company for that to happen.

In your opinion, you're making that argument to someone that considers WOTLK to be overrated by a mile and remembers perfectly well the shitstorms going on back then too. So no, I don't agree that they &quot;haven't done a high quality expansion since WOTLK&quot;. WOTLK was mediocre outside of Arthas, and even the value of his story arch is subjective. <br />

Are those games as big as league of legends though? The game that pushed solo queue and outgrew every game your talking about. Why would I care about games that don't exist, are so smalll hardly anyone plays them, or are on life support... Using appeals to authority or tradition is something retards try. We use to live in huts or shit outdoors but now we have indoor plumbing which is way more sanitary. If those games developers were in touch with the majority of players and so great they'd be appeal to the most players possible. The problem is they fucking aren't and aren't worth resources needed to modernize them.<br />

Do you have a source on hots being the third biggest moba in the world? <br />
<br />
It's true one of the man reason people hate league are toxicity, game length, and how much of an impact others have on there game. Riot pushed solo queue hardcore and outgrew everything.<br />
<br />
Fornite outgrew league because it fixed problems as well no matter what your rating is queues are instant. Games length is as small as possible and players are free to leave at anytime. <br />
<br />
Moba actively punish you for things that are completely out of your control and heroes unlike most made those problems worse with there heavy team based focus. <br />
<br />
The game wasn't just advertise poorly but has design problems and retention issues. No casual games makes playing with friends mandatory to climb effectively. League copied that approach and finally stagnant enough for fortnite to take over. Blizzard design every game they make around premades and teamwork except starcraft II. Everyone of these games is either stagnant or dieing. There is a pattern.<br />
<br />
The moment ghostcrawler joined riot they just made choices that pushed players away.<br />
<br />
Riot only needed to start advertising and really pushing the game after the changes made in season 7. Because they redesigned the game around premades by adding flex and diluding the punishments for uncoordinated group play. Also the tank meta needs to just die 4 tanks being ok is complete bullshit. When assassin stacking and mage stacking are instantly nerfed while tanks are even more cancerous. Tanks have everything and are so oppressive they force everyone to play a tank. The lose the most player during that meta honestly every game does but every company can't seem to understand why nobody fucking likes tanks. It's obvious as fuck.<br />

Blizzard is part of the foundation of ATVI's income, and that income pays the dividends for ATVI stock. Investors are NOT going to demand that ATVI cut loose the basis of the reason for holding the stock in the first place. When Blizzard is costing ATVI money is when they would start to demand that. Blizzard isn't even remotely close to that. Blizzard is still a profitable company, they're just not growing according to expectations. <br />
<br />
IF ANYTHING, if ATVI continues to have problems (and they will, from what it looks like for releases for 2019 across the board), what they will do first is call for new leadership, and ask Kotick to step down. The Board can vote to remove him as CEO. I'm not sure what Kotick's personal stake in ATVI stock-wise, but he can be removed if his actions have impacted the performance of the company. <br />
<br />
Blizzard being cut loose from ATVI is a pipe dream, right now. To even hope for it is flatly ridiculous.<br />

<br />
It's actually quite possible.<br />
<br />
Especially for a company like ATVI, there is only one consideration for them, which is where the maximum financial benefit exists. If they believe that additional value can be unlocked by separating the company into two separately traded public entities, then they would do exactly that. Good examples of this would be Abbott spinning off Abbvie, despite synergistic businesses. Similarly, Altria and PM did this as well.<br />
<br />
Circling back to ATVI, the question becomes whether or not the companies are stronger together or apart. And based on all the turmoil to end 2018, there is a case for both. When things are good, nobody gives it a second thought. When the stock price is under-performing however, that is when investors get involved. And once the investors are involved, it really doesn't matter what ATVI wants if enough shareholders push the issue.<br />
<br />
Do I think this is imminent? No. But do I believe there are some investors running the numbers and mulling it over? Of course, it would be irresponsible not to look at it. And do I think it makes sense? Personally yes. I see Activision and Blizzard looking stronger to me as distinct entities able to focus on their core business, versus a merged unit which is apparently in conflict with itself.<br />

Except yea, they were. Activision only had rights to destiny publishing, not to the destiny IP as whole or any other part of bungie. They could push annual expectations and deadlines, sure, because it was THEIR money on the line.

I'm kind of surprised anyone would assume that would get a positive response in any way... let alone as something supposed to build hype after hinting at Diablo.<br />
<br />
It really shows how out of touch they are, hopefully it served as a wake-up call. But I digress... obviously it wouldn't cancel Blizzcons.</div></div><hr />

Realistically, it shows that they are looking at demand in a different market. Apparently the Chinese markets have been clamoring for this kind of mobile game. It just absolutely sucks for the rest of us that mobile is how they are choosing to continue the story for now.</div></div><hr />

I have no doubt about it. And it makes sense to utilize it in the US and so on. What doesn't make sense is that they made it the centerpiece of the presentation as if it was something to hype over. It's not the product that was bad (it is, but it will be profitable in China as you say if nothing else), but the presentation was... ridiculous, to say the least.</div></div><hr />

It was ill-thought out and smacks of being someone's last-minute decision. Wild guess that it was Adham's call. People should likely get used to it. If Blizzard is going to expand their product line into mobile then there will be more announcements at Blizzcon. That's inevitable.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Crookids</div><div class="date">2019-01-18, 04:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Blizzard is part of the foundation of ATVI's income, and that income pays the dividends for ATVI stock. Investors are NOT going to demand that ATVI cut loose the basis of the reason for holding the stock in the first place. When Blizzard is costing ATVI money is when they would start to demand that. Blizzard isn't even remotely close to that. Blizzard is still a profitable company, they're just not growing according to expectations. <br />
<br />
IF ANYTHING, if ATVI continues to have problems (and they will, from what it looks like for releases for 2019 across the board), what they will do first is call for new leadership, and ask Kotick to step down. The Board can vote to remove him as CEO. I'm not sure what Kotick's personal stake in ATVI stock-wise, but he can be removed if his actions have impacted the performance of the company. <br />
<br />
Blizzard being cut loose from ATVI is a pipe dream, right now. To even hope for it is flatly ridiculous.<br />
<br />

<br />
That's utterly pipe dream territory.<br />
<br />
I can't stand pseudo-intellectual nonsense. &quot;to even hope for it is flatly ridiculous&quot; <br />
<br />
Stepping outside of rational discourse for the sake of posturing and disagreeing. How is hoping for something &quot;flatly ridiculous&quot;? Your probability of hitting the lotto is incredibly low. Does that mean it's &quot;flatly ridiculous&quot; to hope you win?<br />
<br />
As for ATVI, what would happen realistically is Blizzard would be purchased by another major company. Those stock holdings will either be split or transferred or both. The new company buys the controlling shares and it's replaced with cash or they could swap share for share (transferred) and current share holders will obtain shares of the new stock. This can be hugely beneficial for major holders especially considering ATVI's price has been halved over the last 52 weeks. Accompanied with positive PR, this could mean a surge for shareholders and/or options for additional investments. <br />
<br />
As a shareholder myself, I would be interested in seeing this occur. <br />
<br />
Sure, profitability is a good thing and a dividend can help keep investors invested in the stock as part of their portfolio but this isn't synonymous with stock price. Just because a company is profitable and delivers its dividends does not mean they don't care when a stock price falls by 50%. If the company does not recover and shareholders feel Activision's influence is negatively effecting stock price, profit projections and/or earnings -- they will most certainly be willing to consider the possibility of a split. It's extremely unlikely but definitely possible.</div></div><hr />

Well next Blizzcon's highlight will undoubtedly be the upcoming WoW expansion. Every other Blizzcon tends to focus on the new WoW expansion, and the rest have to be something else. This Blizzcon was light on content, but they did have Warcraft III reforged (which was actually the only thing last Blizzcon I really cared about, anyways), so they could have at least focused on that, I think.<br />
<br />
Sadly you're probably right that they are going to focus on mobile stuff more heavily, most likely. I want to believe they won't, but it would be foolish to assume they aren't going to move more heavily in that direction, sadly.</div></div><hr />

Yeah sure it does seem like it, but on the other hand, there's no more Morhaime or pretty much anyone of the public figures which community actually cared for. Now we have just your typical corporate execs like J. Brack and such, who are just bland and not that interesting.</div></div><hr />

I don't think of J. Allen Brack as bland. He's a lot more confrontational. That may well change over this year but people have strong opinions for/against Brack that they never had about Morhaime who by all accounts is a very nice guy and if he made a lot of decisions that people didn't like he never talked about them.</div></div><hr />
