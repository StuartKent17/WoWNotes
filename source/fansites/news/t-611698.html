Holy crap, gloves, bracer, 2 swords, and a belt socket?<br />
I really wonder how much of these are for the &quot;smith only&quot;, and whether there'll be items at endgame raids without sockets.<br />
<br />
Blacksmithing would be insanely powerful for rogues otherwise.. surely blizzard doesn't intend that.<br />
The belt buckle at least looks like a single item that anyone can use. The others though.....<br />
<br />
I also wonder if those sockets will give any stat bonus, or if the socket will be colorless.<br />

And how many melee classes are tailor..... that seems pretty lame.<br />
But it does give good hopes at seeing spell power enchants for leatherworking.<br />

OMFG again update and still no new chain heal ranks omfg, i am starting to believe ,they dont want to give it to us &gt;:(<br />

Seems to be the common going at the moment.<br />
Probably to annoy hardcore raiders.<br />

Are you serious? Please don't call an ability &quot;overpowered&quot; when you don't even know what it does.<br />

<br />
Maim	Rank 2<br />
35 Energy	5 yd range<br />
Instant	10 sec cooldown<br />
Requires Cat Form<br />
Finishing move that causes damage and incapacitates the target. Additional damage caused may interrupt the effect. The victim's spellcasting is also interrupted for 3 sec. Causes more damage and lasts longer per combo point:<br />
<br />
It has a 10 sec cooldown<br />
It requires 35 energy (it would take you 3.5 sec to get the energy back again).<br />
Its a finishing move so it requires combo points (thats another 3.5+ sec to get enough energy for a combo point).<br />
Its a crowd control (it incapacitates), so in PvP so after the 3rd one within 15 sec you would be immune.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nooo.... First maim can't be spammed, it's on 10 second cooldown. Second, it uses combo points to do, and those are precious and to be spent carefully. Third, if you spend more than 1 combo point, the target is already incapacitated for 3 seconds or more. Thus no, it's not overpowered, even though it's good.<br />
<br />

Dude, it doesn't work that way. Swordguard Embroidery (http://wotlk.wowhead.com/?spell=55777) is a spell, not an item. It looks like an item, but sadly isn't. It consumes some Rune Thread as a reagent and doesn't create anything. It works like enchanting. Which is somewhat lame, I agree. As a person who plays (among other things) a paladin, I'd kill for Lightweave. However, I feel like I'd be wasting my time to level a profession for nets, bags and a cloak enchant. I'll just get the spell haste one I suppose. Could you imagine Lightweave + Darkmoon Card: Vengeance though? Aggro city.</div></div><hr />

Wow, you're pretty persistent I'll give you that for credit.<br />
<br />
Be a charm and read this : http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=27927<br />
<br />
Permanently enchant a ring to increase all stats by 4. Only the enchanter's rings can be enchanted, and enchanting a ring will cause it to become soulbound. Requires a level 35 or higher item.<br />
<br />
Then compare it to this : http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=31370<br />
<br />
Permanently embroiders spellthread into pants, increasing healing by up to 66, spell damage by up to 22, and Stamina by 20<br />
<br />
And now compare it to this :<br />

<br />
It's always possible that tailors won't get upgraded leg enchants in the way that leatherworkers do. The cloak enchant might well be the only thing they get. Thus they make tailors different from leatherworkers rather than copying them that far.<br />
<br />
At the same time, they might still get them, since leatherworkers also have drums.<br />
But, tailors also have throwing nets.<br />

I would suspect the following :<br />

<br />
I have to agree with this to a certain extent. Having all tanks viable is great but just making them all the same is kind of stupid.<br />
<br />
I actually prefer the new shield wall but it is looking a bit bleak for prot warriors at present as right now prot paladins are looking much stronger and it seems that the general idea has been to give prot palas copies of the prot warrior abilities only better. The only question mark I see for prot paladins now is the lack of intellect on the new tanking gear. Maybe they really are turning it into blue rage for palas and mana management is going to be a big factor for palas in wotlk, however without a beta key I can't test it to see.</div></div><hr />

According to Wotlk Wiki (http://wotlkwiki.info), Tailors will get new leg enchants. These are sellable though, so they may be another reason to level tailoring. I guess I have to decide if I want Leg enchants, Cloak enchants, bags, nets and the odd cloak. Not a bad list really, but all the socketing with Blacksmithing and a menu of good weapons and armor for both melee and spell is compelling. Also didn't they remove Potion Sickness? If so Alchemy is back in the mix with those wicked trinkets.</div></div><hr />

<br />
notice that this is the spell, not the item itself which will have the requirements, the runic spellthread requires that the character enchating is at least 60, you could work around this by getting a BoE leggard and have your 60+ toon enchant it and then trade the legs to your twink. With this wording the enchant would make the cloak soulbound so you can't trade it to your twink or sell it on AH, etc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Like holy ****?! in cat form you can spam maim like every 3 seconds, maybe 4 sec. OP like hell.<br />
<br />
<br />
I guess you were thinking of Mangle when you said that. Often mixed up. As already stated above Maim is a Cat-only ability that requires Combo points and has a 10 second cooldown. I think the spellinterrupt is just a PvE extra, because all bosses are immune to that stun effect. In PvP it would make little sense because your target is already stunned from Maim and therefore interrupted. It only would be a PvP buff if it was not included in the diminishing return of Maim. So after thrid Maim on a target it no longer stuns but only interrupts casting for 3 seconds. That doesn't seem too powerfull to me.<br />
In PvE this would give Catdruids a Castinterrupt against bosses. But for a high price compared to rogues, shamans and mages. You have to spend all your current combo points and therefore lose a lot of damage potential. I think that is a fair way of giving Cats a decent interrupt in PvE without making rogues cry. They still remain the master spellbreakers as they are supposed to.</div></div><hr />

Edit: didn't realise the previous screeny looked a bit crap - linked a better looking one<br />
<br />
<br />
Right, exactly. And if you look at an enchant, say for instance Savagery (http://wotlk.wowhead.com/?spell=55634), you'll see that the enchant creates nothing and has reagents. And if you look at Runic Spellthread (http://wotlk.wowhead.com/?spell=55634), you'll see it has reagents and creates something. Finally, if you look at the Darkglow Embroidery (http://wotlk.wowhead.com/?spell=55769), it has reagents and creates nothing. So it looks like it acts as an enchantment, requiring Rune thread.<br />
<br />
Again, a pity. I'd love to slap one of those on my paladin's cloak, but I'm not in the mood to level tailoring for a few little blivets.</div></div><hr />

the point is that only Runic Spellthread has an efect of creating an item, the other two cause permanent enchants. Again no item is created by the Embroidering spell.</div></div><hr />

<br />
General<br />
Spell casting and spell channelling pushback has been changed to the following:<br />
When casting a spell:<br />
<br />
* The first and second hit will add .5 secs each to the cast time.<br />
* All hits after the second will have no effect.<br />
<br />
<br />
When channelling a spell:<br />
<br />
* The first and second hit reduces current duration by 25% of total duration each.<br />
* All hits after the second will have no effect. <br />
<br />
<br />
This is by far a bigger change, and more important than the rest of those changes combined. An unfortunate change at that, ohwell hopefully they keep m'uruing encounters and removing spell push back from random targeted abilities.</div></div><hr />

Mmh.. isn't it an improvement over TBC (2MP per dmg untalented)?<br />
<br />
It should have changed at the start of TBC, when STA values were halved (and the relative value of mana doubled) to 1 to 1. That change is also partially responsible for Lock reported OPness. <br />

I would be annoyed if it scaled with +healing. Non-healing classes would get unfairly punished for not having +healing. As a hunter I can't even use +healing but a +2000 mana free instant heal every 5 mins could save my life in many situations.<br />
<br />
I wonder if it is castable on other players/pets? Self only limits it a bit but if you can cast it on a pet that becomes pretty significant. Gift + Mend + herbalism heal would make your pet pretty damn good for killing stuff you probably shouldn't be killing (equal level silver elites, or off tanking in instances). <br />
<br />
It helps in PvP too.<br />
<br />
Granted, I would like +crit or +stam over a 2000 heal but seeing as how I will remain an herbalist I can't complain. It could have been something stupid like +70 spirit or +250 to healing spells which would have /point laugh at all rogue/warrior/hunter herbalists.<br />

Spell pushback. Sigh. In PvP that was the one thing hunters had going for them. A pet beating on a caster and shooting them to prevent a heal from going off or a nuke from firing. Of all the classes, hunters are punished the most by this change because we lack a base spell interrupt. You have to spec MM to get scatter or silencing. If you are heavy beast or survival you get to enjoy seeing the heals land.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
So do warriors in Battle Stance, that's just going to have to be a problem you work around. As MM I get poked and prodded on forums to switch to BM to raid. So I'll turn the tables and say &quot;QQ moar, spec MM&quot;. <br />
<br />
Secondly, using interrupts like that is almost like stun-locking people as a rogue. Keep in mind this is a game where your enjoyment doesn't follow solely around your own experience. I recall the push-back on my own mage and little is more frustrating than being unable to cast at all... not because of any special ability... but merely because of simple auto-attack.<br />

Erm, what the difference if socket is colored or not? You can put any gem you want in it anyway, you just won't get socket bonus if gem doesn't match socket color. Anyway thx for info. :)<br />

75% damage reduction lowered to 50% is a nerf, even if you get to use it more often. When you are facing a hard enrage timer on a boss or some other boss ability that will instagib you without that 75% reduction, this is a significant nerf that might now cause a wipe instead of you being able to squeak out a win.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just to give a little bit more detail, the bracer and glove sockets do not overwright existing sockets or enchants, and they are ONLY usable by blacksmiths because when you apply the socket to the item it adds a requirement to have Blacksmithing at a certain skill level to use the item, and a blacksmith cannot apply them to other peoples stuff anyways. The Titanium belt buckle is usable by anyone and comes in a tradeable item form that anyone can apply and it can be sold on the AH. The belt buckle as I said though is currently bugged. <br />
<br />
All the blacksmith sockets add uncolored sockets, which accept any gem color, I havent done testing to see if you can meet socket bonus req's with these new sockets though, however adding them does not effect existing bonuses on bracers if you have already met the requirement. As for socketing weapons, that is not currently in the beta.<br />

Seriously. That's what, 20 strength with current gems? And it doesn't get in the way of any other enchants either. With Wrath epic gems you could grab 40 haste, 280 armor penetration, or 40 expertise, without sacrificing anything other than mats to level blacksmithing and any BoP stuff you'd get from another profession. I love Engineering, but they'd better buff it to hell and back if they expect me to keep it with the combo of BS+JC.</div></div><hr />

Warriors are not brought to raids because of their stellar AoE abilities, OT DPS output, threat generation or reliability to take high spike damage. Warriors are tanking because when the shit hits the fan (so to speak) they have the tools to survive where the other tanks would be dead. Saying that Shield Wall could be blown to buy some mana regen time (are the healers just going to stop healing?) seems to me to be just a little pointless.</div></div><hr />

Major nerf for hunters this patch and for what reason?<br />
<br />
1 ) Kill command &quot;buff&quot; is a joke, makes it more practical in pvp but destroys viability in pve, good call.<br />
2 ) Who in their right mind will use aspect of the beast over monkey in &quot;melee combat&quot;? Seriously.<br />
3 ) Arcane shot &quot;nerf&quot; is the only nerf that I don't mind. I don't mind because it will be soon buffed to a level that alot of people will cry about.<br />
4 ) Tranq shot &quot;buff&quot; is a &quot;nerf&quot; at the same time. Don't get me wrong, I'm never going BM for pvp, but keeping track of more abilities to counter therefore taking up more bar space is my idea of a great time. Also BM get's countered, oh well, I guess you'll just have to try again in 1 minute and 20 seconds...<br />
5 ) Mongoose bite! Alright!...melee hunter...<br />
6 ) Counter attack was a joke before, no reason to use the max level in arena. Finally it's getting some love, but who honestly is going to go full surv for arenas? Hmmm, counter attack or beast within or silence shot. Let me rack my brain.<br />
7 ) Wing clip does no damage. Ok, let's think about this. It no longer does damage, costs more, reduces their speed to 50% (down from 60%). Makes perfect sense. The only thing I can think of why they did this, you trap, 10 seconds, spam wing clip, 5 yard range (?), hope it procs. If it doesn't, you die. You scatter shot, 3 seconds, you spam wing clip, 5 yard range (?), get two attempts, 1.5 second cd. If it doesn't you die, oh yeah, even if it does, you'll still be in shiv/spamstring range if it procs on the second try. Sounds about right.<br />
8 ) Chimera shot was trash, now it's less trash. It's like putting a V8 on a lawnmower, now you just have a fast lawnmower...</div></div><hr />

<br />
wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong... wrong?<br />
<br />
1) They aren't done with it... but it's pretty weak as it is... The fact that it's causing more damage for a certain time rather than a piddly 200-300 dmg is great. Plus, now it can be strategically used (on bosses, etc...) AND PVP. UPGRADE<br />
2) Beast vs Monkey - I might give you that.. BUT! They are trying to make Hunters less of a worthless POS when you're close. I agree it's pretty lobsided. I think the idea is: If a Mage sits next to you, they'll pay... if they run they'll pay. The same thing with a Rogue, etc... Sure if you're trying to mitigate you're going to go Monkey, but if you're dps'ing.. you'll be like a bad rogue (which is 4 times what Hunters are now)<br />
3 and 4). HUGE BUFF. Seriously? How can this not be. Arcane Shot is a random removal of a buff. I can't remove the BoP when I want, I just have to hope it comes off. With Tranq shot I can now remove the BoP (assuming I'm fast enough to remove it prior to getting things stacked). This is a great idea and well warranted. I don't understand if you want more buttons to press or less... but don't cry about hunters.. they have way less than warlocks, shamans, druids, etc... Only more than Rogues and Warriors imo...<br />
5) That's the point... make the guy who's hugging you pay for it a lot more than they are now. Basically, now (in PVP) hunters are just hugged once the pet is dead. If there is a dispeller or freedom the hunter is completely shut down. Why should the class that can use almost every melee weapon and is supposed to be a master of them not be able to do shit with them? I like this thought process.<br />
6) We'll see what the end result, and I agree very few hunters would go full survival - so I'll agree with you on this one. <br />
7) INCAPACITATES!!!!! - Pally Repents the target, and WING CLIP them, then run... they are incap'ed and you are a mile away while they are slowed... this is huge! I sooo hope they keep it this way. I can scatter, wing clip and run. I might even be able to get a wing clip proc and root them while they are scattered... Not to mention freeze trap + wing clip is huge. This might get nerfed imo.. since it will be too good, but we'll see<br />
8 ) chimera is getting changed a lot it seems.... it's hard to comment on something that's getting changed so much, but we'll see... giving another dps spell/shot seems like a needed thing. It all depends on what the end product is.<br />
<br />
I think you're crazy! These things are enticing me to play my hunter more and more. Hopefully hunters will become less of a scorpid pet + viper sting drain bot in WotLK... cause that gets boring fast. Doing very little damage and just running sucks... for a high dps class.</div></div><hr />

Well, at the moment, I see it as a nerf! <br />
Why? My thought was/is:<br />
Kill Command(5s CD) + Focused Fire(+20%crit-chance on Kill Command) + Invigoration(2%mana every special pet skill crit) <br />
--&gt; More often 2%mana --- If: Invigoration procs on Kill Command<br />
<br />
But still then, when it doesn't proc, I don't feel like the new one is an upgrade.<br />
<br />
And the new one, you can only use every 2min: 60% additional damage on the first pet skill, 40% next and then 20%.<br />
In this 2min, you could use the old one (120s :5s) 24 times... and with 200-300 damage --&gt; it's 4800-7200 damage.<br />
I can't image the new one can go along with that... regardless the additional 2%mana it could give in some of the 24 times.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Haha, I was wondering where you were going with your original post. Yeah, it's a major, major nerf no matter how you cut it. The only plus side is that it better benefits pvp BUT at a 2 minute CD, it's still useless. The only real class that would benefit from it in pvp would be BM... and we are back to where we started.<br />
<br />
My head hurts.</div></div><hr />

Why should it benefit in pvp? And how?<br />
+2%mana and more damage with the old one<br />
<br />
What is besser with the new one?<br />
And regarding the actual damage of pet special skills... 20-60% is not much...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well I guess you should consider the fact that the incapitation breaks on damage and you could now use maim as a spell interrupt and just continue dealing damage... and as it is a silence it might serve quite well in dual melee teams where an incapitating effect is completely useless in many situations.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
While that was true for BC, WotLK makes the effect act like a fear in terms of damage breaking the effect. I think the tooltip says &quot;MAY interrupt the affect.&quot; So the even then the breaking on damage is kinda moot.</div></div><hr />

<br />
About as much useful as only slowing down &quot;any&quot; spellcast, by no more than 1 second.<br />
Huge nerf to hunters, druids, rogues or fury warriors in terms of pvp effectiveness.<br />
<br />
Curious why they didn't make it less big.<br />
0.8 sec off 0.6 sec off 0.4 sec off 0.2 sec, then 0. for example would make a lot more sense.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, added another Summary (http://rrvs.blogspot.com/2008/08/beta-profession-update.html) for the proffessions listed so far.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But its also a fair change to spell casters.<br />
<br />
No more being a frost mage or Ele shaman trying to cast a frost bolt or lightning bolt and even know it should be 2 seconds it takes 6+ seconds just to cast because your getting hit. Its worse than a stunlock because you cannot do anything about it.<br />
<br />
If melee's are getting hit they can still melee so why is it if spellcasters are getting hit they cant cast at all?<br />
<br />
The ONLY problem I see for this atm tho is not offensive spell casters but defensive ones like healers.<br />
<br />
Unless you got enough ways to stop spell casting they will beable to just sit there and heal themselves the whole time.... Tho, once they are out of mana they are cake, but with the new spirit changes lol even a out of mana healer will beable to heal again in a few seconds.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Delondial</div><div class="date">2008-08-12, 08:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I spent the majority of my BC career as balance (since feral turned into a hot steamy pile of manmuck) and I must say something needed to be done to suppress the utter domination melee had over casters (in most cases, healers excluded). That being said I'm seeing this as over kill, and the numbers are going to need to be messed around with before warlocks take back their title of undisputed most annoying $^*$ head class to fight. Seriously if this goes through as is you'd have to be pants on head retarded to not win as a warlock. <br />
<br />
As a side note it's ironic that some of the things druids $%^&amp;ed about during the great bear nerf are being brought back, as if we were right back in the day when we said &quot;now thats a bit much.&quot; I certainly hope they are not serious about their statement way back when that said &quot;druids will rediscover their healing roots in WotLK&quot; since that was all we could do pre-bc and the current 41 point talent is to turn into a bloody tree. Irony abound.</div></div><hr />

As MM I get poked and prodded on forums to switch to BM to raid. So I'll turn the tables and say &quot;QQ moar, spec MM&quot;. <br />
<br />
Secondly, using interrupts like that is almost like stun-locking people as a rogue. Keep in mind this is a game where your enjoyment doesn't follow solely around your own experience. I recall the push-back on my own mage and little is more frustrating than being unable to cast at all... not because of any special ability... but merely because of simple auto-attack.<br />
<br />
Don't like it that your enemies can actually fight back now?<br />
<br />
Ha.<br />
<br />
Hahaha.<br />

Your argument shows too much sound reasoning, I speculate that you do not play a hunter at all.</div></div><hr />

what is that supposed to mean. I say the purpose of the panic button is lost and now we're forced to use it as much as possible apparently because the cooldown has been reduced signicantly.<br />
now why am I trying to explain the obvious to someone who probably only knows dps.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Laotzu</div><div class="date">2008-08-12, 08:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">75% damage reduction lowered to 50% is a nerf, even if you get to use it more often. When you are facing a hard enrage timer on a boss or some other boss ability that will instagib you without that 75% reduction, this is a significant nerf that might now cause a wipe instead of you being able to squeak out a win.<br />
<br />
<br />
But now we have Shaman Spirit Link ability which will split 50% of the incoming damage between 2 nearby raid members. Plus the changes to Blessing of Sacrifice which as &quot;Hand of Sacrifice&quot; - will transfer 20% of the damage taken by the target to the paladin for 12 seconds. While the spell has a cooldown it would be possible for multiple paladins to cast this one after the other to keep it up on the MT.<br />
<br />
Yes its a nerf to the effectiveness of shield wall but combined with Spirit Link and Hand of Sacrifice it will be much easier to keep a tank alive by spreading the damage around (and a paladin could cast HoSacrifice and then bubble and take no damage while still reducing the damage on the tank by 20%..).</div></div><hr />

Saying that Shield Wall could be blown to buy some mana regen time (are the healers just going to stop healing?) seems to me to be just a little pointless.<br />
exactly<br />
why would healers suddenly stop healing for some mana regen when I pop shield wall, that would be an unnecessary risk, plus I'd like to see the reaction I'd get when screaming they're wasting mana while still spamhealing as usual. :P</div></div><hr />

If only the &quot;can still melee&quot; could mean &quot;do the same problem you'll do when your heal/damage spell finally lands&quot;... because a Ret paladin auto-attacking is something so... lol... the only ones I can see having any chance against ubber heals and ubber damage spells would be fast hittings like rogues or hunters (ranged).<br />
<br />
And looks like elem shamans will be able to throw everyone away from them... lol at that + new spell pushback.<br />
<br />
This out of mana healer healing in a few seconds alread happens today, they will only happen more with other healing classes. Tired of seeing a ret paladin or arms warrior loosing to druids without mana and close to death, that somehow can heal himself with a little bit of mana to almost full again while the ret pally wasted all his mana trying to finish the druid or the warrior waiting for rage to do something with his slow attacks. The warrior maybe can do a comeback at that, but the poor ret paladin auto-attacking... lol</div></div><hr />

<br />
Seriously, this might very well be one of the more important changes in PvP and its whole dynamics. Combined with the usual 70% interrupt resistance talents, this change will significantly level the playing field between casters and melee.<br />
<br />
<br />
Level? Guess not. Unless armor reduces magical damage too or they remove all armor from cloth/leather (and other physical damage mitigation abilities from casters, be it pure mitigation or free chance on get hit to slow attacker and all), almost imunity to interrupt that some casters have with talents (not to mention increased casting time or less heal for those damn fast heals), and fear should not be spamable then since they won't break from dots (that also does insane dmg while that happens) and damage from others whiles the melee verison normally breaks from ANY damage and have longer cooldowns.<br />
<br />
Also you can't punish every melee 'cause of the rogues.<br />
<br />
And btw, makes sense that a spellcaster should be pwned in melee combat the same way melee get pwned by spellcasters when they can't get melee range and take full damage fast blows.</div></div><hr />

While playing a rogue I have no problem with interrupting most damaging spells. The only problem is/was with healers, especially palas and shammys - now the problem will grow. That was from a rogue pov, but what will say fe. retri palas, who have no interrupt skills? (HoJ and Rep are just too long CDs to be considered as a real interrupts). Runing around a &quot;mage/lock/all other&quot; who 3-hits you with 3k bolt and you cant do a shit ? <br />
I know it will be redone probably hundreds of time till WoTLK release but still sounds a little OP...<br />
Arcane shot change - finally.<br />
And...<br />
Give Rogue info, Blizz! :)<br />
<br />
<br />
Yeah... because the healing landing means doing everything again to bring him down again, while they did only one move to get back, you probably wasted some CDs and huge attacks to try kill him.<br />
<br />
All that while you probably won't be shiny and new waiting for a luck crit burst/combo or the healer going OOM. You'll be getting pwned by others or even the healer himself with DoTs.</div></div><hr />

Basically, now (in PVP) hunters are just hugged once the pet is dead. If there is a dispeller or freedom the hunter is completely shut down. Why should the class that can use almost every melee weapon and is supposed to be a master of them not be able to do shit with them? I like this thought process.<br />

You're talking about warriors or hunters? :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Finelle</div><div class="date">2008-08-12, 03:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The pushback change makes sense. Speaking in relative terms, noncasters have hugely increased their capability to land interrupts or to continue using abilities while still threatening an interrupt through the Kick/Pummel/Shield Bash change. Therefore, casters should receive a bonus to spellcasting in between interrupts.<br />
<br />
From a game-balancing perspective, I think the change was a far-sighted move. Forcing casters to overwhelmingly favor instants over cast-time spells would only be viable if WoW was a pure PvP game. When doing PvP balancing vs PvE balancing, it would be a lot easier if the relative values of mobility in each aspect did not differ hugely. Having to balance casters around only using instants would lead to enormous headaches.</div></div><hr />

Swordguard Embroidery<br />
Embroiders a magical pattern into your cloak, causing your damaging melee attacks to sometimes ignore 1000 of your target's armor.<br />
You can only embroider your own cloak and embroidering your cloak will cause it to become soulbound.<br />
<br />
Now tell me, where is &quot;Bind of Pickup&quot; written in it? WHERE?<br />

<br />
to me that seems op. the same is true of healers, where pushback was necessary for warriors/enh shams/retadins/hunters to occupy the time between interrupts, since we do not have 10 interrupts as rogues do. <br />
<br />
i also see this being an issue when multiple melee or dual wield melee are on a healer. if you get 2 quick hits early in the cast, if may interrupt a maximum of 0.2-0.4 second and not the full 1 second maximum under the current changes. allowing dps or even healers to free cast will tip the balance more in their favor, although given how easy melee has had it at 70 i suppose it was a long time coming.</div></div><hr />

Unless you're saying Rogue A gives Tailor A a BOE cloak, then yeah. But the cloak will BOP to Tailor A. If you're saying you want to do it like Enchanting... then no, not going to happen. <br />

It said, &quot;YOUR OWN CLOAK&quot; and if your understanding of these 3 words is what you wrote, hell, I'd be rolling in tons of gold right now from enchanting rings for someone else.</div></div><hr />

Thats so called bullshit, sir! Spellbushback is outdated mechanic that was added time before arenas shadowsteps ect. And melee dmg is higher than comparable spell dps when they get to bash their target. Also to your armor argument im fine with it as soon every melee class gets blue bar as well so they know how does it feel to not be able to continue forever.</div></div><hr />
