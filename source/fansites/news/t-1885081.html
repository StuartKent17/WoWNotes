Submit Questions for the Developers<br />
We have our first interview in a long time coming up at Blizzcon and as always, we want to let the community ask questions! This time our interview will be covering the design of Legion.<br />
<br />
If you have any questions you think we should ask, be sure to add them to the comments of the linked post (http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/1885061-Submit-Questions-for-the-Developers) for consideration. We will pick the best questions and add them to our list! <br />
<br />
<br />
Don't post any questions in the comments of this news post. Use the linked topic (http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/1885061-Submit-Questions-for-the-Developers) instead.<br />
These should be questions about Legion, not Warlords of Draenor.<br />
No class specific questions please. This includes things like balance between the different healing/tank/DPS classes and specs.<br />
<br />

Blue Tweets<br />
Blizzcon<br />
Any chance you're onstage for panels at BlizzCon this year Dave? Loved you the other year and hope to see you again this year!<br />
None of the main stage panels, although I'll probably sit in on the voiceover panel again this year. Thank you! (DaveKosak (https://twitter.com/DaveKosak/status/653983375842131968))<br />
<br />
Character / Items<br />
for my own sanity, could u pls confirm that droprate for Medallion of the Legion was not nerfed in 6.2.2? Not seen it in weeks<br />
There have been no changes to its drop rate since Tanaan went live with 6.2. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/653746294226223104))<br />
<br />
Please fix Legendary Ring's explosion getting wasted during Soul Capacitor trinket procs.<br />
How is it wasted? Your contribution should get captured and amplified further by Soul Capacitor. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/653746471238418432))<br />
<br />
PvE<br />
why don't you let us use the (repair) mount in both Socrethar and Tyrant arenas?<br />
In general, you can only mount outdoors â€“ those areas both are fully enclosed. Engineers can drop Jeeves wherever, of course. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/653746098297663488))<br />

PvP<br />
So what did folks who played and watched think of 6v6? (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/653358937689862144))<br />
6v6 format works well, enjoyable to watch and looks like great fun to play. Few thoughts though... large buff icons on name plates is annoying, especially when you have players clumped up. possibly allow BL/TW in 6v6, hard for loser to comeback and this should help without being OP. possibly making some maps that suit 6v6, would be awesome.<br />
Thank you for your thoughts. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/653415518196465665))<br />
I like objective based better than arena for sure. Matches can get decided a little early on control points however.<br />
Yea control point maps play no better with 6 than they do with 10 sadly (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/653360882328571904))<br />
<br />
Have you considered 4v4?i mean why did you missed the 4s as bracket i can't see it being more unbalanced than 2s but can be fun tho<br />
2 healers 2 dps. yuck (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/653363603190321152))<br />
<br />
Lore<br />
Life Tap is surrounded by what seems to be fel energy, so my Q is: Is fel power converted life force?<br />
The way I would describe it: Fel is chaotic energy. Warlocks convert life into fel, draining the victim as a source of power. (DaveKosak (https://twitter.com/DaveKosak/status/654345020619689984))<br />

The most challenging part of game development is getting people to stop playing Overwatch. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/653629808908222464))<br />

UPDATE (October 23, 2015): We were able to complete setup and testing of our beta servers for Europe sooner than anticipated. As a result, we're happy to report that we will be launching the Overwatch Closed Beta in both the Americas and Europe gameplay regions on October 27.<br />

Chances are 95% of the closed beta invites will go to media, streamers, and youtubers. They have already said there will be open beta tests on certain weekends starting the weekend after Blizzcon. I'm not holding out any hope for a closed beta invite since I do none of those things stated above.</div></div><hr />

Ever heard of artistic license? Dalaran and Ironforge both appear in the film even though they weren't really a factor in the First War. They made it a flying city for the film because it's more visually interesting.</div></div><hr />

Context man, context. He immediately follows up that statement by saying its a movie about character. He was emphasizing that the story is just as important as the visual technicalities.</div></div><hr />

Holinka also proves he doesn't even like PVP. 2 Deeps + 2 healers vs... Man, so many ideas for that.<br />
<br />
It's annoying. They should quit or be fired.<br />

Blizzard do not really put ressources into the movie... not much. and it is a video game movie.....so yeah expect the worse, anticipate the bad, hope for the best. But we know what happen to video game movie most of the time.<br />
<br />
The moment, I started thinking about this movie being bad is the moment they said 2 tribes fighting.......human arent really a tribe, or where LOTS of clan(tribes) that decided to ally.</div></div><hr />

They already explained why they did that. It wasn't done out of ignorance, it was done intentionally, with Metzen and Blizzard's approval. They retconned certain details to make some things look cooler, who cares, get over it. It'll probably make the movie look that much better to the masses.</div></div><hr />

How the heck do you even know what it is or isn't? We haven't even seen a proper trailer yet. This is outright blind hate you're displaying here. Settle down and give them a chance to prove your concerns wrong. It already has a lot going against it as a video game movie. But if it's a good movie, it deserves huge profit and a franchise on the big screen. And did you even consider how many more &quot;resources&quot; will come their way if this movie's a success?<br />
<br />
As for &quot;insane new technology&quot;, he's not wrong. ILM is working on this movie, the best in the business, the people who did Star Wars visual effects. And they themselves have said this is some of the finest work they've ever done. One of their leads was quoted saying there were 3 times in the companies history where they felt they made something groundbreaking. The first was the T-Rex from Jurassic Park, the second was Davy Jones from Pirates 2 and the third is visuals in this movie. So what does that tell you?<br />
<br />
I think you should reserve judgement until we see the damn thing.<br />

Because sometimes, when you write something 20 years ago, you don't consider everything, and some ideas don't even come to you. So 20 years later when they'd like to change certain details taking what they know now into account, what's wrong with that? They're not changing entire themes, just details. I'm sorry but I see a lot of complaining over nothing from people who just like to complain about change. I see nothing wrong with it. And a lot of times the story can actually be made even better and richer when they go back and revise it.</div></div><hr />

I'll say the same thing i say to you dumb kids day in and day out, just because a game has shiny awesome graphics does not mean the gameplay will be the same. The same goes for films,shitting all over the lore just for a few shiny fireworks will ruin it for a lot of people not just me. Try thinking before speaking.</div></div><hr />

Yes! To Trihara you must listen. <br />
<br />
1. You don't even know the context for why Dalaran is floating. Could be a flash forward, could not even be in the goddamn movie and was just a example of artistic direction, or who even knows. NOT you haters, that'd for sure. <br />
2. What DIFFERENCE does Dalaran floating make to anything at all pre Wrath? None of consequence. <br />
3. Sometimes changing old things is better. Battlestar Galactica is a perfect example along with every single marvel cinematic universe movie <br />
4. What resources do you imagine are being spent by blizzards wow team on this movie? They aren't doing the script or effects or marketing. At best Metzen &amp; Morhaime took some trips to have some meetings and approve of things, if their contract even allows it. They don't write quests or make models or even run World of Warcraft. <br />
<br />
Duncan Jones, ILM, the actors, and Blizzard seem proud of the work and it's being given the coveted jurassic world summer slot in theaters. Let's at least wait for a real trailer - if not the actual fucking movie - to criticize &amp; hand wring about lore.</div></div><hr />

I guess you can look at it like the movie &quot;Braveheart&quot;. Most of the &quot;history&quot; in that movie is pure fiction, but it's a great story to eat popcorn to. <br />
<br />
To most movie goers, they don't care about the real story of Willam Wallace, they just want to be entertained for two hours by a sweaty half naked Mel Gibson in blue face paint and a weird &quot;Scottish&quot; accent. If you want accurate, read history books or Discovery Channel.<br />
<br />
The same goes for the Warcraft movie. You'll have the Star Wars nerds bellowing &quot;fake&quot; at Han not shooting first, and the rest of the audience, who wish those nerds would shut the fuck up. <br />

In the end, it doesn't matter. It's a movie. It's sole existence is to sell tickets, so a couple of rich producers can be richer. Lore? Who cares, it's the movies. Lore in the game? Blizzard has already shown that lore is something that exists because of the game, and can and will be changed whenever they need it to, &quot;canon&quot; be damned. This isn't classic literature, this is a video game and a video game movie. It just doesn't fucking matter to the majority of people who will play the game or see the movie. You can post all the threads you want, when it comes out, picking it apart &quot;Orcs CLEARLY have 6 teeth on the their belts, not five, how lame.&quot; but at the end of the day it just doesn't fucking matter to almost everyone outside of this forum.</div></div><hr />

Yeah I doubt that would be a problem for me.</div></div><hr />

The same goes for films,shitting all over the lore just for a few shiny fireworks will ruin it for a lot of people not just me. Try thinking before speaking.<br />
You must be an insecure grumpy old man to call me a dumb kid when you don't even know me. I appreciate your concern but I said exactly what I wanted to say and hopefully you'll wait to see something before you completely close your mind to it. Who knows, you might pout your way to the movie theater and end up being surprised.</div></div><hr />

I mean, in Ashran, Wintergrasp, Tol Borad, BGs, you can end up in a 1v1 situation and if you survive long enough or don't put the other person away quickly enough, reinforcements would arrive. It's war, not some stupid PVE race, so the more the merrier IMO. Arena should be more of a side game with no real rewards.</div></div><hr />

I know your &quot;type&quot; and that is enough for me. I cant watch anything that has lore tied to it and watch it get butchered for the sake of a few extra $.</div></div><hr />

I agree, and I think the only reason they focused on it was because they felt it would be easier to balance than BGs in the long run (they were wrong, and broke PVE half the time in BC/early wrath as a result to &quot;fix&quot; it.)</div></div><hr />

And what &quot;type&quot; is that? The type that disagrees with you? A somewhat foolish thing to say. But if you feel justified in antagonizing people over a difference of opinion then so be it. But do yourself a favor and lighten up sunshine.</div></div><hr />

You have such informed opinion about the movie and &quot;the guy who made the movie&quot; that you don't even know his name? Fail.</div></div><hr />

Your type is the ones who think shinier is better,or who gets a bf/gf and soon as something better looking comes along you dump your current for the shiny new one. The typical Xbox/PS fanboy claiming &quot;GRAPHICS IS ALL!&quot; when Nintendo glide casually along making 10X as much sales as both of them combined.<br />
