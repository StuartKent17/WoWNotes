Activision Blizzard Earnings Call<br />
Activision Blizzard has their quarterly earnings call today, with the report being inadvertently posted early. <br />
<br />
<br />
Activision Blizzard had 374 million Monthly Active Users in the quarter. This is down from 385 million last quarter. <br />
Blizzard had 38 million MAUs, down from 40 million last quarter. <br />
World of Warcraft over-performed versus the prior expansion at this point in time, with higher engagement sequentially and strong community participation with in-game purchases.<br />
Preorders for the upcoming expansion, Battle for Azeroth, are ahead of plan.<br />
Overwatch continues to add new players, and engagement remains strong, with the most recent seasonal event, Retribution, having a higher participation rate than any prior event<br />
The Overwatch League launched its inaugural regular season in January and continues to have strong viewership globally, reaching millions each week, with the playoffs still to come this summer. <br />
Overwatch League has led to increased engagement for the franchise overall, with combined hours spent playing and watching Overwatch increasing sequentially.<br />
<br />

Mage Tower Appearances<br />
If that's true, then, given that you believe there's still plenty of time to get the Mage Tower appearances, how do you feel about the amount of time players have left to obtain the Prestige skins?<br />
Prestige artifact appearances aren't going away and will still be obtainable.<br />
<br />
The only appearances that will be no longer obtainable after Legion ends will be the Mage Tower appearances and the three other skins within that row, since you need the first appearance to unlock the other three, and the +15 appearance.

Protection Warrior Numerical Analysis<br />
Disclaimer: this is sort of analysis is necessarily rough--beyond these basic estimates, talents and many other things will affect mitigation and overall tank performance in any given context.<br />
<br />
Disclaimer 2: I didn't review your calculations or assumptions, but the approach seems reasonable.<br />
<br />
Even based on your own conclusions, you're greatly downplaying the Warrior's mitigation advantage in your example. &quot;Only 6.64%&quot; is a very large difference when the Druid is only taking 33.57% of incoming damage in the first place. The Warrior (who's taking 26.93% of incoming damage) is taking 19.8% less damage than a Druid. 19.8% is a very large mitigation advantage--it amounts to a 25% increase in effective health, which is very close to the 29% higher health the Druid has in your example.

Can we get some clarification on the inner workings of Bone Shield on BFA Beta? Stacks seem to drop much quicker in multi-target situations than on Live. Has the type of things that remove stacks been changed, or the internal CD reduced/removed?<br />
In the Battle for Azeroth Beta, Bone Shield still has a 2-second internal cooldown on losing stacks. If you spot a bug, please try to give us as much detail as possible. Thank you!<br />

Can you explain what's the interaction between Downpour and Deluge in Battle for Azeroth for Restoration Shamans? (If there is interaction, if not, it's like losing a talent?)<br />
As of the next build of the Battle for Azeroth Beta, this should no longer be an issue, since Downpour no longer replaces Healing Rain. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/991087279417344000))<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
If prestige is going account wide, does that mean artifacts appearances or color variations are unlocked in all characters once BfA begins?<br />
Yes, if you unlock an appearance that requires an account-wide Prestige level, all of your characters will get that appearance. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/991090346300915712))<br />
In Battle for Azeroth, all of your Prestige levels are going to merge. So if you have three characters who reached Prestige 4 in Legion, your account will be set to Prestige 12 in Battle for Azeroth. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/991798484956102656))<br />
<br />
Professions<br />
In BfA will we have to relearn crafts from previous expansions?<br />
In Battle for Azeroth, any crafts you’ve learned in the past will still be there and not need to be re-learned, with the exception of First Aid. Tailoring and Alchemy crafts, bandages, and anti-venoms that used to be in First Aid will have to be re-learned. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/976599336325754880))<br />
<br />
PvE<br />
Uldir only has 8 raid bosses? In the past we had NH, TOV and EN for Legion, TOES, HOF and MSV for MoP, TOTF, BOT and BWD for Cata, as you can see so far it's very concerning you'll be going down the WoD route with less raids.<br />
Highmaul had 7 bosses; Nightmare had 7. Uldir has 8. Much of Nighthold was in data at Legion launch, but it didn't open until months later so it doesn't really offer a true parallel. I will say that we're pretty happy with the quantity of raid content that Legion offered. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/973254342055575553))<br />
<br />
&quot;With the Azerite system, you're not going to see the big inflated numbers we had in Legion&quot; -WatcherDev That's weird, I don't remember checking out MMO-Champ and seeing scientific notation. <br />
You're looking at datamined internal tables out of context. The current plan is for you to be collecting 3-digit quantities of Artifact Power and working towards 4-digit and 5-digit goals pretty much all expansion long. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/986805287402127360))<br />
<br />
Testing shows “Vectis” raid test this week, but there is currently no such boss in journal, npcs, anywhere really. it doesn’t exist. Not even in todays build that got reverted. Is this a boss rename? If so, what boss?<br />
Vectis is the boss formerly known as “Blood of G’huun”. Other references will be updated in a future build of the Battle for Azeroth Beta. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/991360502965063681))<br />
<br />
Island Expeditions<br />
How bout the ai? They're kinda dumb and squishy. Mobs too, but that was expected. I want the ai to make me go &quot; oh no they didnt!&quot; instead of &quot; they're dead.&quot;<br />
On Normal, that's kind of expected, on H/M it should be scarier! (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/987011180748193792))<br />
<br />
And the much-promised account-wide unlock/level your alts on islands as well (and please let us know how it feels to level, the xp probably isn't great atm but we'll fix it). (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/987010955518164992))<br />
wait, WHAT?????<br />
Do unlock quest at 115 on one character -&gt; islands for all your 110-120 doods. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/987011844199014400))<br />
<br />
Curious if you are discussing player behavior like we saw in Ashran where Alliance would control the road while Horde farmed the perimeter. Also I see the goal is to get 6000, what will the losing team get.<br />
The overall amount of stuff is limited and doesn't respawn, so we haven't really seen this. You're forced to clash eventually! Losing team still gets Artifact Power based on how much they collected, we don't want it to feel really bad to lose. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/987014446076719104))<br />
<br />
Pet Battles<br />
Will scaled enemy pets have access to all their skills? Will there be an incentive to use max level pets for WQ's if it turns out to be easier to do the quests with level 1 teams?<br />
They don't have all of their skills, but do have buffed stats, so it may be more difficult to fight them at low level (but worth the XP). (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/989281427710607360))<br />
<br />
Misc<br />
Is Moonrest Shore still in Val'sharah? I think it might have been there at launch and replaced with Verdant Cliffs (falcosaur area), but there doesn't seem to be any information anywhere about it.<br />
Moonrest Shore was an early name for Moonrest. The thinking was that you could see the shore from there. But you can't, really, because the trees block your view of the shore. Which is fine. They're lovely trees. Very restful. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/976598403420311554))<br />
<br />
Maybe I am one of the very few players that is a sucker for stats, but you still haven't added Seething Shore to the PvP/Battleground statistics list. At least the win/loss ratio would be nice, maybe even captured Azerite.<br />
This was a bug that we're working to fix in Battle for Azeroth.Thank you. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/991088348650328064))<br />

<br />
It would be a refreshing change to see a company post honest, detailed reports. Instead of using a few select outstanding selling products to pretend the entire company is healthy. For example, I'd like to see the MAU year over year on D3 or WoW, Im betting you'd see a steep downcurve with a massive upcurve on something like Overwatch and Hearthstone</div></div><hr />

Why should they be different from posters, always jumping at the opportunity to claim earning calls are fake, lies, skewed, dishonest - and then supply no proof.<br />
<br />
I mean....the reports are out there for you to look at and analyse and then lay down the smack on us how Blizzard is declining. That is before...why is that so important to point out? Or claim? You want them to fail...or warn us to sell our shares in Blizzard / Activision?<br />

<br />
WE only know that people spent more money in the store and the people who kept playing played more time in the game than they did in the last expansion which is not surprising since Legion was much more grindy. My gut feeling is subs are still down or they would have mentioned retention of players being better.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is a panel for Shareholders, not players. It's about money and naturally they talk about this, since blizzard invested so much money on the overwatch-league. So yes, they need positive news about it.<br />
<br />
The Decline of Subs is more of an warning sign.<br />
<br />
Legion is overperforming, but this is in comparsion to WoD; not really hard to fullify.<br />
<br />
BfA sales are beyond expectations, but we don't know what the expectations are (probably set really low, because it's better to say it's overperforming rather than underperforming).<br />
Also we knew that for cosmeticals people are very likely to spend money. But it does not tell how good the next expansion will be and how big the sub-numbers are.<br />
<br />
And right now we can't say how it's performance will be because of the error on the stock market; dow jones released the earning call ahead of time accidently, resulting in a 3% jump and 5% fall. There might be consequences for this error.<br />
<br />
Currently the stock is performing well, but not without risk. But the prognosis is still buy, even through the market isn't performing as well right now.</div></div><hr />

This was a blizzard earning call. And seeing Overwatch is a direct competitor to fortnite (which is getting all the media attention)<br />
said in the 1st post only time will tell, but the last time an expansion was surrounded by so much negativity we all know how<br />
that turned out. <br />
<br />
they stopped giving out wow subscriber numbers because the community and various sites<br />
kept saying Wow was dead. <br />
<br />

If you think that it'll never turn in the opposite direction, then yes? I guess so? <br />
<br />
Same as how X people pretend that WoD's downward curve wasn't remedied by the release of a new expansion which literally did the exact opposite of WoD throughout its lifetime. <br />
Don't you worry, I'm sure they'll grow their MAU again with the release of various content for their games.</div></div><hr />

<br />
given the numbers HS and Overwatch seem the most likely areas that have seen drops.<br />
point being given the age of Wow the core community base it still has, some better PR<br />
and cutting back on some of the dismissive comments might actually help.<br />
<br />
Also When they announced wow tokens they said at the time keeping an eye on the gold level<br />
would be important, that's totally gone out the window at nearly 359k each on EU servers.<br />
I just buy pre paid time cards and when I have enough gold top up that way, but loads of players<br />
just use gold and the price its gone now is insane.<br />

Blizzard's announcement cinematic for BfA has 12+ million views. I think they'll be fine on the PR department. WoD has AMAZING PR work, and ended up slashing the playerbase in record time. Putting out a product good enough that word-of-mouth is positive, does wonders for PR. <br />
<br />
As for the WoW token, Supply and demand.<br />
<br />
If EU players in general didn't have enough gold, the tokens would start dropping. If Blizzard stepped in and suddenly slashed the price of a token in half, the buyers would be temporarily happy but it'd end up in fewer sellers for sure, increasing demand and thus spike rocketing the price again. <br />
<br />
Not that I see how that had anything to do with the discussion...<br />

the last official numbers for wow were around the 5.5 million mark before the ended that part of the call.<br />
the cinematic is one of the best they have created, I will truly happy if proved wrong and BFA is amazing success.<br />

<br />
And then they released an expansion, an expansion which sold as many copies in the same amount of time as WoD did when it skyrocketed to 10 million subs. <br />
<br />
BfA will be a success, they're bringing what worked in Legion, upping the world design a few notches and introducing more different means of progression.<br />
<br />
As far as I am concerned, Ion pulled the game out of the dumps (WoD) and showed the true potential of what this game can be and what the development is capable of (Legion, BfA).</div></div><hr />

Why is it that in a capitalist country it is such a crime on these forums for a company to make money? Also, pre-orders, no one held a gun to the buyers' head...<br />
<br />
If you don't want to pre-order, than don't. Easy, simple, no problem. If you do like it, it's your money to spend. The forums don't control where I spend my money, or don't.<br />
<br />
Oh, and of course, all the declining sales leads to 'WoW is dying! Overwatch is dying!'...Well, I'm dying in the next 40 years, most likely, but, I can only dream of how much money Blizzard is going to make before WoW and Overwatch actually die and get shut down.<br />

And you forgot that Activision Blizzard is made up of 3 major divisions - Blizzard , Activision AND King Entertainment.<br />
<br />
Monthly Active users were down across the board. <br />
<br />
Have a look at page 39 of <br />
<br />
https://investor.activision.com/node/31476/html<br />
<br />
Activision had 51 million monthly active users down 4 million from 55 million Monthly active users (which they state is due to lower MaUs for Destiny 2)<br />
<br />
King Entertainment had 285 million monthly active users down 5 million users from 290 million monthly active users (which they state is due to minor deceases across King franchises as well as bored people now longer playing King games)<br />
<br />
Blizzard had 38 million monthly active users down 2 million monthly active users from 40 million monthly active users. This is across ALL Blizzard games as we no longer get a break down for each game.</div></div><hr />

I am pretty much the same, I will pre order any WoW expac from Blizzard because I know what I am getting.. And so far not been stung by them.. On the other hand if I see a pre order/early access or whatever on Steam I am always wary of it.. Of all the games I got from Steam I think I have only done the pre order/ early access twice and have been lucky so far..</div></div><hr />

But it is a genius move. Nobody here can deny that.<br />
<br />
Loads of games offer pre order incentives for easy income. I'd say with most games I've preordered with bonuses I've got my moneys worth.<br />

Yes lets just all ignore their gross pre-order practices and give them a pass because they are blizzard and act like EA/ubisoft are far worse offenders and so its ok. Ok guy<br />
<br />
What gross practices out of curiosity though? Pre order bonuses have been a thing for years if you are referring to those and loads of companies do it. Yes it's naturally to make money as that is the main goal of any company these days but I'm just trying to work out where you find it &quot;gross&quot; as you put it. Not trying to defend Blizzard here but more work out the train of thought on your end.<br />
<br />
Allied races were just a usual pre order bonus. They made it quite clear about the requirements for them. Right under the purchase page, at Blizzcon and it was posted to a very large amount of external sources/fansites from PTR builds back in December.<br />
<br />
If you are referring to the refund thing I agree. They could easily just disable the boosted character and allied race. They don't have an excuse for that. They disabled the boosted toon with WoD when a few of my friends refunded it. The refund policy for BFA is definitely a shitty one this time around though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Pre-orders were useful for both sides once. Players could be sure they'd be getting their box in the store, and companies had a better estimate on how many people were going to play their game. Since physical pre-orders are no longer relevant because everything is served as a digital edition, companies thought of an incenitive for players to pre-order again. Not really seeing the problem here.</div></div><hr />

right at the moment it feels the devs are going one way and a % of the players the other.<br />

I mean, I'd be right there with you -- what they're doing is super predatory -- but I wanted to level my new characters and I was going to buy the expansion anyway so I just went ahead and prepurchased so I'd get the early access rewards. Which I suppose is even worse than preordering? But, y'know, no downside... bit of an upside... and hell, my bank account balance will be the same either way in six months.<br />

If you think the majority loved the leveling changes then I have to assume you are delusional. 1-60 was fine The rest after that was a slow and very boring slog. All the changes did was make leveling more tedious then it was before and take more time to increase the MAu metric. If the majority loved it then the MAU should not have gone down so much. 7.3.5 was a epic fail</div></div><hr />

And if you keep assuming the majority hated them then the same can be said.<br />
<br />
Also Blizzard went down 2 million MAUS in a fucking lull period where we are waiting for the next expansion.<br />
<br />
2 million out of 40 is not a huge fucking drop and quite frankly for a lull period I would have expected more.<br />

They destroy their games and their potential cause they seek short term earnings. The community sees that and punishes them by not buying their products, by making posts regarding the game problems etc, but blizzard ignores them most of the times. That's why people complain and become negative when they see earning calls like this. <br />
I used to play WoW untill blizzard's server policy drove me away years ago. Supposedly mmo, the game became single player for those who remained in my server and blizzard never addressed the issue. <br />
Jumped to HotS afterwards but various problems put me off this game too. Nowadays I'm just playing other games and checking websites like mmo-champ for old time shake, in hope there might be some news regarding vital problems in blizzard games.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard is doing fine, WOW is not . That is easy enough for any one to see. And blizzard is not doing as weell as it once was. Overwatch is declining, as is HOTS and HS. King Games are on the decline as well and not even a mention of Diablo 3. Blizzard needs something new and a big break out game. Bfa Has the lowest hype and expectation of any expansion. Spin it all you want and white knight it as you normally do, but WOW is not looking healthy at all</div></div><hr />

How can you hate 7.3.5? It gave us 4 backpack slots.<br />
<br />
Jokes aside, the leveling change allows for much more flexible leveling. It's not a boring faceroll where halfway through the zone with heirlooms you outlevel everything and have to move on. You can stay in the said zone and know that you will finish it before you outlevel (starting a new zone at 58 doesn't count..). It sucks for people who have 10 alts and want more, it sucks for people who don't care about the story and it sucks for people who just want to rush through everything. But it works fine for the rest. Plus people still did stuff in Argus the previous quarter, not shocking at all that the MAUs decreased, as leveling isn't that compelling. But I'll agree with you on the fact that Diablo 3 is pretty much dead at this point.</div></div><hr />

I and most others already did all the levelling content many times over. The new levelling changes didn't make it any more compelling it fun, especially since you are missing so many talents. It just made levelling a long boring slog, especially 70-80. And then having to go through WOD again who's levelling was completely on rails just made it worse. I unsubbed before 7.3.5. But discovered I had some unused time cards , cane back to try a class I didn't have, monk, and just couldn't do it. And so far the only selling point for BFA seems to be allied races and they decided they want you to level 1-100 just to get the herative armor. That's gonna kill the expansion<br />

<br />
If you looked back at other Quarterlies from 2010-2014 they still noted changes in the company in IP and general finance with their big and smaller games.<br />
<br />
SCII has been adding more features in this quarter, but apparently are not financially noteworthy.<br />
Same with HotS.<br />
Before more would have been noted, even the small stuff.<br />
<br />
My feeling is these (4) games are not turning enough profit to get investors interested, and are withheld from the quarterly report.<br />
Makes me feel like they are maintaining these IPs because it is part of the Blizzard brand. If they were to even take a loss, they may be sustained by their bigger profit games.<br />
<br />
The take from this is are the resources from the big games being held back because of the niche audience games to keep them alive and make Blizzard look more whole? Or are the less noteworthy games sustaining themselves and each department is working financially independently.</div></div><hr />

That was not the end of the official subs though. They had one more where the sub rate basically balaned out. Of course people ignore that one for their agenda.<br />

So Either way it never hit rock bottom the bleed was visibly ending like it did in the previous 2 expansions after wrath.</div></div><hr />

hmm ok fair point I missed that. it sure makes Tom Chiltons leak at legion launch of 10.1mil make alot more sense. however it still would have got lower than 5mil during last year of WOD maybe down to 3mil like the red trend line suggests. and you cant really ignore the trend line from cata to mop to wod that line would have continued even with the spike of legion.<br />
<br />
Also remember they are not saying that legion has more subs now in its low point than WOD they are saying it has more &quot;monthly active users&quot; than wod did in its low point. that's VERY deceptive from them and the two don't correlate at all<br />
<br />
even with subs going down Mothly active users could easily go up via more people using tokens more people using free trials more people playing alpha/beta than played legion alpha etc. not to mention that to be counted as a monthly active user you could log only once in a entire month on a free account and play for 1 hour and log off highly deceptive data. Monthly Active users represents interest in the game more than total number of people subbing which makes sense. people are more interested in wow now than they where at the end of WOD because back then no one knew if legion would be good but that doesn't mean more are subscribed now than then the use of MAU instead of subs basically confirms that less are.<br />
<br />
ultimately the RED trend line is still true and wow really probably is about 1mil subs atm. 982k was what was being spread around twitch (not sure its origins thou) <br />
<br />
even if bfa gets 10mil subs people are simply just buying expansions to level and then like 70% leave after 3months and ignoring this spike its still declining regardless of expansions.<br />
<br />
as soon as a expansion turns the game around and cause real subscriber growth and not MAU or some deceptive number when a expansion actually increases growth that sustains past launch we will hear about it but sadly that will never happen because wow is objectively dyeing and its getting close to its final endgame now and we all know it.<br />
<br />
the developers talk in QnA and stuff about adjusting things that will help future expansions past BFA but imo they would get sheltered from these numbers as well some one high up at blizzard is going to walk into a office some day and say fuck it and shut it all down. and that will be that.</div></div><hr />

Regarding the 10.1M sub count in Legion featured in both of your graphics:<br />
<br />
&quot;Update: Blizzard Entertainment claims Tom Chilton never discussed the World of Warcraft subscriber numbers. The 10.1 million subscriber statement is being attributed to either a misunderstanding or a mistranslation on the part of PIXEL.&quot;<br />

its basically impossibly to misquote a number like 10.1million blizzard just denied it because it was policy to not release it and Chilton prob got a fine for it.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dracullus</div><div class="date">2018-05-08, 05:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">prestige merg is pretty wierd, i got on one character 25, and on all together like 40 does that mean i will get like 15 prestige reward right away with BfA luanch?<br />
<br />
It's very simple - first prestige cost a lot less honor than any other (I believe it may be even 50% less). Prestige 2 and onwards cost the same. So if have alt with 10 prestige, he will add 9.5 to the pull.<br />
<br />
They did it so it doesn't matter which char you play right now. Otherwise it would be more profitable to just level all 110 chars to prestige 2, even if you don't want PVP with them.</div></div><hr />

The new levelling changes didn't make it any more compelling it fun, especially since you are missing so many talents. It just made levelling a long boring slog, especially 70-80. And then having to go through WOD again who's levelling was completely on rails just made it worse. I unsubbed before 7.3.5. But discovered I had some unused time cards , cane back to try a class I didn't have, monk, and just couldn't do it. And so far the only selling point for BFA seems to be allied races and they decided they want you to level 1-100 just to get the herative armor. That's gonna kill the expansion<br />
