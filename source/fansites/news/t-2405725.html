<br />
If they preserve the zones yes. Otherwise no. Situations like cataclysm or vale of eternal blossoms are quite sad. Hoping for zidormi to be there, since the essence is quite different on this arathi. the colors feels different. Gladly arathi will be on classic, and I don't think there were huge changes from vanilla to cata on arathi.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not sure why Hammerfall isn't the Horde base though, maybe someone with better lore knowledge can fill me in there. <br />
<br />
And not to nit pick but that keep has had one entrance for 14 years and now they are under seige they add a side gate and fill in the moat?</div></div><hr />

Keep the red if wanted, it's faction color, but FFS does every horde building HAVE to be orcish?<br />

Fucking this. I was so pissed in WoD when my belfs got Garrisons and then found out &quot;lol no customizing the building appearances. Only orc versions of everything. Not even some default cut and paste belf buildings from Eversong. None of that. Only orc.&quot;</div></div><hr />

Make sure you go with a 120. Even if you visit it with a 119, it will look like olden times.</div></div><hr />

Well I agree that, the Horde building style is Orcish too often. For Hammerfall though? It used to be a Human internment camp for Orcs. Hell it is the place were Doomhammer fell, hence the name. In other words an Orcish style is the appropiate style for this specific case.</div></div><hr />

I still have no idea what Warfronts are. PVP garbage? Some kind of scenario? Single- or multiplayer content?<br />
<br />
They are PvE content, they are dynamic ongoing battles between the factions.</div></div><hr />

Well while you may have a point, on this occasion Hammerfall has always been an Orcish settlement. The vast majority of the current inhabitants are Orcish. It makes sense that this would be an Orcish settlement.<br />
<br />
Also, the real reason is that they are reusing a lot of garrison assets for these bases. Building this stuff takes time, they even did dev blogs on the effort they were going into creating these buildings.<br />
<br />
As the next warfront is probably the barrens, they'll probably repeat the process and the Horde base there will be similar.<br />
<br />
AFTER the barrens though things might get interesting, there could be more variety there.</div></div><hr />

It's kinda reflecting iRL. :P It looks nice tho but Arathi won't be the same for sure.<br />
<br />
I'm kind of agreeing with the Horde base orc thing. Hammerfell already existed, I don't see why the orcs would build another fortress so close by, particularly when Hammerfall is situated better. I would have liked a forsaken fort by the arathi gate.</div></div><hr />

I hope every Warfront will have different style. Of course starter one has iconic human/orc theme (both main base and reward gear) but second one exactly like that would be redundant. Warfront:Barrens could be Tauren base (defend) vs. Night Elf base (attack) - all building and gear would be themed after these two. We could also get:<br />
<br />
- Forsaken vs. Worgen (well, this is must) - Warfront:Gilneas<br />
- Trolls vs. Dwarfes (because why not) - I have no idea where it could be located<br />
- Nightborne vs. Lightforged - Warfront:Suramar with Vindicaar (don't judge me, man can dream).<br />
- Blood Elves vs. Void Elves: Warfront:Edgefront<br />
- Goblins vs. Gnomes (ok, I went too far).</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think all warfronts will be irrelevant for the main plot and H/A will just decimate themselves in final battle during 3rd (middle patch) or last tier.</div></div><hr />

Fucking this. I was so pissed in WoD when my belfs got Garrisons and then found out &quot;lol no customizing the building appearances. Only orc versions of everything. Not even some default cut and paste belf buildings from Eversong. None of that. Only orc.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hammerfall is an orcish settlement named after Orgrim Doomhammer, it's basically a shrine to the orcs. It's where Orgrim died and was cremated.</div></div><hr />

For Hammerfall though? It used to be a Human internment camp for Orcs. Hell it is the place were Doomhammer fell, hence the name. In other words an Orcish style is the appropiate style for this specific case.<br />
<br />
Did not know this. I see.</div></div><hr />
