Maelstrom Crystals for Honor/Justice in Patch 4.1<br />
You might hate or love this change depending how much time you spend speculating at the AH, but Maelstrom Crystal (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/52722/maelstrom-crystal/) will be available from Honor and Justice points vendors in Patch 4.1. Someone pointed out that I never posted the price for those, there, have a screenshot. <br />

Jider (Rogue) Solos C'thun &amp; Twin Emperors<br />
You might remember Jider from his past videos of Grobulus and Patchwerk solo kill a few months ago, he's now back in a new video featuring a very ... interesting solo kill of the Twin Emperors and C'thun as a rogue! <br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;object width=&quot;700&quot; height=&quot;455&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;movie&quot; value=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/v/SqN0VYQVvnA?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US&quot;&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;allowFullScreen&quot; value=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;allowscriptaccess&quot; value=&quot;always&quot;&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;embed src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/v/SqN0VYQVvnA?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US&quot; type=&quot;application/x-shockwave-flash&quot; allowscriptaccess=&quot;always&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot; width=&quot;700&quot; height=&quot;455&quot;&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;<br />
<br />
From Jider<br />
Phase 1 of C'Thun is quite simple, damage the Eye of C'Thun until 0% which then triggers Phase 2. This phase is significantly more difficult. To start, C'thun has a shield reducing all damage taken by 99% and various adds will spawn throughout the fight. Shortly after Phase 2 begins you will be eaten by a tentacle which is unavoidable and once you are inside his stomach you must kill two Flesh Tentacles to weaken and bring down his shield. The reason this fight was thought to be impossible to solo is after seven seconds of being in the tentacle room you instantly die if you are attempting the encounter alone. Normally, to get out of his stomach you must reach the platform in the center between the two tentacles inside but seven seconds is not enough time to do this. <br />
<br />
So, after some theory-crafting I set out to apply clever use of game mechanics and soon enough had a working strategy. I would now pull Ouro to C'Thun's room. Like most bosses when you attempt to evade them they will port you directly to them so I used this ability to my advantage in Phase 2. Once eaten Ouro would perform the necessary task of porting me out and to increase DPS time on the tentacles inside I changed races to Goblin for the Rocket Jump ability. I also changed my spec to subtlety for shadowstep and finally leveled up Engineering for Tazik Shocker (glove enchant). Combined, these three abilities gave me enough time to do damage to the Flesh tentacles and eventually weaken C'Thun and brought the encounter down to a reasonable two hours.<br />
<br />
Twin Emperors Explained : Both Emperors share the same health, When one loses health so does the other. Using good timing i pulled Vek'nilash alone while Vek'lor remained out of combat. There for they would not use teleport. And since they are split up they can not heal. Vek'nilash is immune to magic and can only be damaged by physical damage which is why i chose him. Vek'lor is immune to physical damage and can only be damaged by magic. When Vek'nilash dies so does his brother Vek'lor even though he is out of combat.<br />

Nice job Jider, your solo vids are always interesting. <br />

And glad to see Maelstrom Crystals will be rather expensive, but I forsee the price still coming down a lot considering all the ZA/ZG loot that will be getting DE'd.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;These 2 fights took place on the PTR servers because i have not played in a year so my gear is bad on live. It is definitely doable in my current gear but i choose epix. I practiced it on live server and this can be done on live servers. If you are willing to put the time and effort into it, you to will be able to solo these ecounters. Also i saved myself 50$ (race changing to goblin then back to alliance) and race changed for free on PTR.&quot;</div></div><hr />

The twin ems can't be pulled one at a time on live, so yeah ... kind of an exploit. No idea about C'Thun, but it smells kinda fishy to me.<br />

The fact that the guy refuses to explain how exactly he did the Emperors should be a huge warning sign.

Hunters and rogues have ways to pull any mob by itself, be it a boss that usually pulls with other mobs, or one mob out of a trash pack. I won't explain it here for obvious reasons, but it does exist.</div></div><hr />

Well then, oh Swanky Swami of Secrets, what's your input on the encounter other than being a raging chest-thumping fanboy? Sure, &quot;creative use of game mechanics&quot; explains C'thun. Same went for his Grobbulous kill. But how exactly does a hand wave Jedi Mind Trick bullshit excuse of &quot;good timing&quot; explain pulling one boss in a linked encounter? PTR or no, Vek'nilash and Vek'lor are linked, and by virtue of their fight mechanics, impossible to solo. It's like someone pulling one of the Blood Princes and going &quot;I JUST TIMED IT RIGHT, LULZ!&quot;<br />
<br />
People don't &quot;fail&quot; for squinting funnily at a solo kill that by all rights, is impossible. What, did he have a stack of Goblin Gentleman's Magazines on the other side of the room distracting Vek'lor? A really big sandwich? &quot;Good timing&quot; doesn't explain how he pulled one boss in an encounter that is designed to pull BOTH of them at the same time, no matter what the raid size or makeup.<br />
<br />
<br />
Back on topic: leveling an heirloom-less tank (not even the DPS BoAs) now, I can only shake my fist at Blizzard, as I'm feeling every point of missing expertise and hit rating. Also ETA: the BoA Skullforge Reaver still sheathe on the back like its counterpart from Strat? It seems to have lost its glow, at any rate. If it still sheathes on the back, it'll look badass sitting behind some of the new shield designs.</div></div><hr />

It doesn't matter how he done it, it's just doesn't suppose to be that way so it's a bug at best.<br />
<br />
The only mechanic this fight have is keep them separated and meelee/spell immunity.<br />
If you can skip the dual pull it's just a bug/exploit there is no difference from doing it by killing Vek'lor as meelee.<br />

It's really interesting that people who actually playing this game so much can not distinguish a clever use of the mechanics from an exploit/bug.</div></div><hr />

I don't really care about how much time i have invested in my characters. What we do today is irrelevant tomorrow.<br />
<br />
Anyho... really want those heirloom leggings. As for the rings i would not be surprised if blizzard will be releasing another ridiculous &quot;fishing&quot; event in cata where you have a chance of getting that ring. Remember wotlk and that heirloom ring? Yeah, something along those lines. The leggings i have no idea, maybe they could be bought when guild reach level 25? We'll see soon enough i guess.

It's posted as even though these are old content fights, they were designed so they could NEVER be soloable. Regardless of level. The fact someone found a mechanic bug (after all this time) means it was a well programmed fight that's only just been cracked. I bet people have tried for the past couple of years like mad to do this alone and not had any luck. Until now.</div></div><hr />

Like most people, I am not too sure how to comment on the Twins. It is odd that the other didn't pull. Perhaps as one person said, he pulled an add at the same time which made the encounter think 2 emps were pulled same time? I dunno... But that would be the 'timing' answered.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I solo'd Illidan on a private server in BC using a bug with blind that caused the boss to constantly be disoriented. It took about 2 hours to kill him as a rogue solo. If I had recorded that and posted it as a &quot;rogue first solo kill&quot; it would have as much legitimacy as this video.</div></div><hr />

Not really, you can still use mail/leather/cloth spellpower heirlooms. For shield there isn't an alternative:P Not that not having a heirloom one is that big of a thing, in the long run...</div></div><hr />

A good up to date shield provides more benefit for a leveling tank than a pally loses by wearing mail at that level.</div></div><hr />

I'm betting that he deliberately set up the pull so that Vek'nilash reset slightly quicker &amp; became re-attackable while Vek'lor was still evading.<br />

Just a guess, but it's the only way around it I can think of - plus it completely fits with his &quot;just timing&quot; summary, cos it is.</div></div><hr />

Other way around. The ring is likely to be the heirloom ring rewarded from a ZA/ZG questline. I doubt we'll get the legs until 4.2 at the earliest.<br />

Always been able to keep them equipped. And even though they say they give bonus XP, you might want to test it by killing the same exact mob twice, once with the 1-80 heirlooms on, once with them off.</div></div><hr />

Doesn't look like it. He pulled the melee boss twice in his video. The first pull was a clean pull, which means Jider was out of combat. Since he hadn't killed all the trash, one of them added. Jider vanished to reset the boss and reengaged immediately after killing the add. The caster boss didn't aggro both times.<br />
<br />
I can't see any clue of &quot;good&quot; timing.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, looking closer I think you're right.<br />
<br />
Only other thing I could think of would be something encounter specific related to the add, but I only started playing in BC so I'm not familiar enough with the prequel pulls to guess personally. Time to head on over to AQ40 &amp; do some testing =)<br />
<br />
edit: i just can't see jider being sloppy enough to pull &amp; fight-to-the-death that add unless it was necessary he do so for his strat.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Bring the meele boss to the caster one, vanish, the caster one would instantly reset while the meele one has to run back to his spot to reset completely. Jider would hit the meele one before it reset and thus the caster one wouldnt have attacked.<br />
<br />
Apperantly, they activate on &quot;Pull&quot; And techincaly, it wasn't a &quot;Pull&quot; because they didn't reset completely, so the caster one didn't attack.</div></div><hr />

You can easily tank every instance up to level 80 with normal non-heirloom gear. It's even easier with standard non-tanking plate heirloom gear. Exagerration doesn't help to get your point across; rather, it detracts from it.<br />

<br />
Only six bosses have ever been killed solo by a rogue before any other class: 10 man and 25 man versions of Patchwerk and Grobbulus and of course C'Thun and Twin Emperors all defeated by yours truly. In addition, I was able to solo all other bosses in Ahn'Qiraj so this marks the first time a rogue has successfully cleared a raid instance before any other class. If these types of kills interest you please check out my other videos and let me know what you think.<br />
<br />
I would really like to see his solo Viscidus kill. <br />
<br />
EDIT: <br />
<br />
Actually looking both are exploits, the boss should be engaged as is, not with the assistance of anything that breaks game mechanic i.e. teleporting out of stomach. Remember the Kungen feat. Digusting Oozeling debuff fiasco, same shit here.</div></div><hr />

Obviously Blizzard isn't cool with it, since they banned guilds in the past for using similar tactics he used on C'Thun. Doesn't matter that it isn't an hack or addon or what not, the boss wasn't ment to be engaged with another boss hanging in his room which nullifies his raid wiping ability (no person outside = wipe raid). As mentioned above, Kungen then of Nihilum used the Disgusting Oozeling pet to apply the pets stacking debuff on himself while in the stomach of C'thun - he filled all the the 16 debuff slots with the oozelings aura, so C'thus stomach acid debuff couldn't be applied to him anymore or if it was applied, he ran the macro for pet again, kicking the debuff away. That way he could stay in the stomach, killing tentacles without taking &quot;any&quot; damage, trivializing the encounter. Blizzard didn't like that, banned the whole guild instantly for day or week, fixed the pet. <br />
<br />
What does that say to us, Blizzard doesn't tolerate exploits where one avoids abilities of bosses. In this case he exploited on both bosses, the C'thun exploit wasn't much different from what Kungen did back in the days, if you look at it, Kungen was also smart to macro summon/dismiss pet to get 31 debuffs, but in the end it was an exploit. Just because it's doable doesn't mean it's supposed to be done.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Servasus</div><div class="date">2011-04-04, 03:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">In all honesty I believe Blizzard probably released the tank set knowing a lot of tanks queue up in full dps heirlooms and no shields, or many times, not even in the right spec. While I don't believe for a second this will eliminate that problem in it's entirety, I do think a tanking heirloom set will encourage those who want to level tanks via dungeon finder to actually use gear that is appropriate for them. Can you &quot;tank&quot; in dps spec and gear? Sure. Does this make it any easier on those healing you? Not really. It's just an added convenience to recieve these heirlooms more than it is a necessity. <br />
<br />
Also for those that are still asking about the heirloom legs, the tank legs are not the only heirloom legs in game atm. On Beta for Cata, heirloom legs for all the normal heirloom sets existed, and worked from 1-85. However, these did not make it alongside the helms and capes once Cata went live. So just because mmo has posted the legs as part of the &quot;preview&quot; doesn't mean they will actually be released, and if they are released, Blizzard will (hopefully) release all the other legs as well. <br />
<br />
There are also heirloom rings for casters, mdps, tanks and agility users &quot;released&quot; in the game as well, they just are not on live. You can find all of these items by visiting wowhead.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Tanks in dps spec or healer in dps spec is much rare now since dual spec is pretty much affordable without sending gold from other charaters.<br />
However the ridiculously high cost of 81-85 heirloom do defeat the purpose of promoting the right gear for leveling. It is not uncommon to see 81-85 non-cloth wearing cloth heirloom just for the exp bonus in dungeons.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Servasus</div><div class="date">2011-04-04, 04:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That's just your personal experience. My personal experience has been quite the opposite. Twinking toons and running through low levels is basically what I do when not raiding, and just yesterday I had 2 ret paladin tanks within only a couple runs of eachother in the dungeon finder. And I haven't run into a single player using the incorrect heirloom helm or cape for their class while running dungeons, even when leveling my priest from 80-85. Am I saying you're wrong? Not at all.<br />
<br />
But it's not difficult to run 6 or 7 dungeons to earn 1 piece of heirloom gear, unless you're having issues with heroics, in which case you shouldn't even be buying heirlooms, you should be buying JP gear for your main. As for the guild heirlooms, I wouldn't call 900 and 1,500 gold a lot of money by any means. This is cataclysm, if you can't go and make 1.5k gold in an hour or two, you're doing something wrong. While I'm not denying the heirlooms cost more to buy now than they did in wrath, it's a little over the top to say they are inaccessible to the point where you can't be bothered to save up for a set specific to the class you're leveling. Are people still doing it? Probably. But they are lazies and bads and losing out on 5% of their main stat by doing so.<br />
<br />
Again, the point I made in my original post, which seemed to be ignored, was I don't see tanking heirlooms as a necessity, but more as an added bonus, and as a way to deter a (admittably) small percentage of players from wanted to queue tank with dps heirlooms. I don't think it will equal the end of me seeing that ret paladin or fury warrior tank again, but maybe I'll be seeing less of them. Positive thinking, folks.</div></div><hr />

It would be impossible without it, and the way he did cthun was just smart...you could probably call that an 'exploit' too but who gives a shit. Not like its current content. He still put in the time/effort/strategy and did something most likely noone else has (probably why so many people with panties in bunch).<br />

I would really like to see his solo Viscidus kill. <br />
<br />
EDIT: <br />
<br />
Actually looking both are exploits, the boss should be engaged as is, not with the assistance of anything that breaks game mechanic i.e. teleporting out of stomach. Remember the Kungen feat. Digusting Oozeling debuff fiasco, same shit here.<br />
<br />
<br />
Where did he say he killed Viscidus? That is an optional boss and dose not require to be killed to clear and get the achievement of a full AQ clear. You can get the achievable without killing the optional boss. So weather he did or not his statement is accurate.</div></div><hr />

Sure, &quot;creative use of game mechanics&quot; explains C'thun. Same went for his Grobbulous kill. But how exactly does a hand wave Jedi Mind Trick bullshit excuse of &quot;good timing&quot; explain pulling one boss in a linked encounter? PTR or no, Vek'nilash and Vek'lor are linked, and by virtue of their fight mechanics, impossible to solo. It's like someone pulling one of the Blood Princes and going &quot;I JUST TIMED IT RIGHT, LULZ!&quot;<br />
<br />
People don't &quot;fail&quot; for squinting funnily at a solo kill that by all rights, is impossible. What, did he have a stack of Goblin Gentleman's Magazines on the other side of the room distracting Vek'lor? A really big sandwich? &quot;Good timing&quot; doesn't explain how he pulled one boss in an encounter that is designed to pull BOTH of them at the same time, no matter what the raid size or makeup.<br />
<br />
<br />
Back on topic: leveling an heirloom-less tank (not even the DPS BoAs) now, I can only shake my fist at Blizzard, as I'm feeling every point of missing expertise and hit rating. Also ETA: the BoA Skullforge Reaver still sheathe on the back like its counterpart from Strat? It seems to have lost its glow, at any rate. If it still sheathes on the back, it'll look badass sitting behind some of the new shield designs.<br />
<br />
Never raided molten core did you. Remember those &quot;linked&quot; lava packs. Remember how hunters could shoot, feign death, then shoot again during the reset have the whole pack reset but mircaulously pull only 1 mob every time. Pray tell what exactly was that because almost EVERY raid did that. It was called splitting, something every hunter in a raiding guild was expected to know how to do, people now got used to easy trash and tanks running in and going LOLOLOLAOE and then trash dieing but I assure you there are things in this game that can break mechanics. Am i saying thats what Jider did no. Im saying your writing all of these things off as &quot;encounters&quot; when clearly in the past weve broken encounters before to make pulls easier.</div></div><hr />

As far as I can recall, from leveling my pala a few months ago, the first relic you can get is at level 40. From Scholomance. More annoyingly it's a sta/int/spri relic, so nearly useless for anything but holy palas. The only advantage it has is the ability to take any WotLK epic gem. <br />
<br />
Past that the first actual tanking relic is Relic of the Paragon from a quest involving Stratholme; a quest that can't be done before level 46. <br />
<br />
Even if the heirloom had no XP bonus it'd still be VERY useful as getting relics before about level 60 isn't straightforward.</div></div><hr />

Not quite sure what the connection is here. They're nerfing gold drops because lower level raids have become so trivial that many classes can solo them, and the amount of gold you can get is disproportionate.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Disproportianate to what? I get something like 1800g from running Molten Core, bits of AQ, and Karazhan, and that's largely from selling the drops rather than the gold from each boss. Compare that to the money made from doing a weeks worth of dailies (which I don't), and I've lost out.

Relics and idols go in the ranged slot, like wands/bows/guns/crossbows/thrown... shields go in the off-hand slot, like.. off-hand items, I guess ;)<br />

That said, there is an heirloom bow and an heirloom gun... no wand/idol, though I guess I can see why they would implement those two weapons because Hunters mainly use those, the idols/wands are mainly stat sticks.</div></div><hr />

If you're just grinding bindings, you won't get gold, because Geddon and Garr don't drop any. Some other bosses don't drop gold either. But some do, Ragnaros certainly does.</div></div><hr />

As mentioned above, Kungen then of Nihilum used the Disgusting Oozeling pet to apply the pets stacking debuff on himself while in the stomach of C'thun - he filled all the the 16 debuff slots with the oozelings aura, so C'thus stomach acid debuff couldn't be applied to him anymore or if it was applied, he ran the macro for pet again, kicking the debuff away.

What does that say to us, Blizzard doesn't tolerate exploits where one avoids abilities of bosses.

Now I don't know much about this but wasn't this something like world first? I'm pretty sure Jider doesn't benefit anything expect a few gold coins in a virtual world?

<br />
Could you please refer me to the sources of the whole Cthun kill claim? I am just curious. All I've seen as a &quot;proof&quot; of the whole Nihilum exploit thing was the kill shot made by Kungen where you can see a macro with the oozeling icon on the bars. Now I am not exactly fan of Kungen/Nihilum/Ensidia, I am just curious.<br />
<br />
For example: 1) If you were going to exploit an encounter, wouldn't you make sure to cover your tracks, instead of releasing incriminating screenshots?<br />
2) Why would you make a macro that looks the same as the oozeling, if you knew it was an exploit.<br />
3) Why couldn't that be any macro that just happens to have the same icon?<br />
<br />
I just want to be clear on this. Link me some sites, show me some logs because I have the feeling people are just repeating what they read somewhere without even questioning the issue, just cause their logic is Ensidia/Nihilum/Kungen = bad <br />
<br />
All I can see is that Nihilum is listed as world first on Cthun for example here http://www.sk-gaming.com/content/16397-WoW_world_first_list</div></div><hr />

I'm pretty sure that I and many many others are not jealous of not being on the main page of MMO-Champion. It's quite different feeling. As a rogue I was a bit excited seeing the title and jumped to it quickly just to ... be really disappointed. Ye, that is the best description of it - disappointment. In my personal opinion none of the &quot;solo&quot; videos should be posted on mmo-champion front page and especially not the ones involving any form of bug/exploit usage. <br />
<br />
<br />
... Atleast he does something instead of standing in front of a fountain watching the world go by!<br />
<br />
There is a lot of rogues and other class players doing more challenging and interesting fights right now. Fights that instead of going anal-mode into game mechanics require skills and clever usage of class abilities, those impress me more. Like someone said before, three legged cow can fight Twin Emperors this way. I would really like to see Jider doing something that require some basic skills...</div></div><hr />

soloing matheridon, time 15 mins<br />
gold earned, 550-600g depending on drops.<br />
<br />
How many dailies do you have to do to make that amount of gold? around 25 now take the time it takes to do 25 level 85 dailies and you will see why it's getting nerfed. My estimate is every quest takes 10 mins with all the running so you'd get the same gold in 16~ times as much time.

RaF does not stack with Heirlooms.
