Tol Barad Honor Change + Bridge Exploit<br />
The good old days are over, sorry guys!<br />
As you’re probably aware by now, an update was applied to Tol Barad shortly before the holidays which granted the attacking side 1800 Honor Points for a victory. While the goal with that change was to provide more incentive for the attacking forces to claim victory, it ultimately led to an undermining of the spirit of competition in Tol Barad. We’ve just applied a hotfix which has lowered the attacking faction’s gain to 360 Honor Points for a victory. The defending faction will still earn 180 Honor Points for a victory.<br />
<br />
We appreciate all of your feedback regarding this change. We'll continue working to make Tol Barad a fun and engaging PvP environment. <br />
<br />
Whats the word on the bridge exploit?<br />
We're working on a fix for this right now. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Update Cataclysm Hotfixes - Updated Jan. 3<br />
Here you will find a list of hotfixes that address various issues related to the release of patch 4.0.3a and World of Warcraft: Cataclysm. While many have already been deployed on all realms, some may not be implemented until the next time your realm is restarted. We will continue to update this thread in the days ahead as additional hotfixes are applied.<br />
<br />

<br />
Righteous Fury is now unable to be dispelled.<br />
The Strength bonus from the Retribution version of Guardian of Ancient Kings now applies its bonus based on total Strength instead of just base Strength.<br />
<br />
<br />
Dungeons &amp; Raids<br />
Bastion of Twilight<br />
<br />
It was sometimes possible for Arion to instantly Chain Lightning the targets affected by Lightning Rod, with no time for them to react. This has been corrected.<br />
If one of the three most distant targets from Ignacious was 20 or fewer yards away and Ignacious picked that target for Inferno Leap, the spell would fail entirely, but the cooldown would be consumed. Inferno Leap can now be cast on players 20 yards or fewer away from Ignacious.<br />
The Elementium Monstrosity will now prefer ranged targets to melee targets with its Electrical Instability beams. If there are more beams active then there are ranged targets present, then the beams will start hitting melee targets.<br />
Flame Destruction cast during the Cho'gall encounter now does approximately 30% more damage per stack on Heroic difficulty.<br />
<br />
<br />
Blackwing Descent<br />
<br />
Sonar Pulse is now spawned on top of Atramedes' current location and will spawn regardless of where Atramedes is tanked. In addition, Sonar Pulse now idles for 1 second after being cast before they move away from their spawn location.<br />
It is no longer possible to use immunities to reset a player's sound bar while fighting Atramedes.<br />
Atramedes' Sonic Breath now properly ignores line of sight.<br />
Spirit of Ironstar's Shield of Light was taking too long to break and now absorbs less damage.<br />
<br />
<br />
Deadmines<br />
<br />
Divine Shield prevents all damage from the Sparks in the Mechanical Nightmare.<br />
The Foe Reaper 5000 will not cast Harvest on players more than 70 yards away.<br />
<br />
<br />
Grim Batol<br />
<br />
Trogg Dwellers which cannot be reached by players via legitimate means no longer award experience or drop loot if killed.<br />
<br />
<br />
Lost City of the Tol'vir<br />
<br />
Lockmaw's Frenzied Crocolisks have learned how to swim! In addition, Vicious Poison was doing too much damage and has been reduced slightly.<br />
<br />
<br />
Throne of the Four Winds<br />
<br />
Players now receive credit for the achievements Heroic: Conclave of Wind or Throne of the Four Winds if they are dead when the encounter is defeated.<br />
It is no longer possible to fully resist Wind Burst from Al'Akir, avoiding all damage and knockback.<br />
Al'Akir's Static Shock has been changed from a damage-over-time spell with interrupts on ticks (10-second cooldown), to a direct-damage interrupt spell (5-second cooldown).<br />
<br />
<br />
Items<br />
<br />
Bloodthirsty and Vicious Gladiator's Chain Gauntlets had incorrect bonuses attached. Their bonuses now correctly reduce the cooldowns on regular traps and launched traps by 2 seconds.<br />
Bloodied Wyrmhide Gloves no longer have any expertise rating on them, and now grant Spirit instead.<br />
<br />
<br />
Professions<br />
Archaeology<br />
<br />
Select Archaeology nodes and dig sites have been updated to ensure the Map listings are correct and the nodes properly spawn within the dig sites.<br />
<br />
<br />
Cooking<br />
<br />
The cooking daily quest Chef's Awards no longer have a limit to how many players can hold at one time. Please note that the user interface will still say a maximum of 10 Chef's Award currency can be possessed until a client-side patch can be applied, but players can accrue more than 10.<br />
<br />
<br />
Tailoring<br />
<br />
Tailors with 400 skill or higher should now receive additional cloth drops 50% of the time from anything that drops cloth, up from 25%.<br />
<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
<br />
Baradin Guards now correctly attack Horde players which enter their aggro radius or attack them.<br />
Tol Barad now awards 360 Honor Points for winning as the attacking faction, down from 1800. Further details can be found on our forums.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">greyghost</div><div class="date">2011-01-03, 10:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Now Blizzard needs to step up and balance the damn place instead of yanking around reward numbers -- considering that this simply makes TB ownership one-sided again.<br />
<br />
They need to face it -- the 'win-trading' that servers had going on was essentially trying to emulate the ideal environment for Tol Barad: high ownership turnover so that both factions have ample opportunity to complete the daily quests and reap the other miscellaneous benefits.<br />
<br />
Edit: ABOUT ****ING TIME about the Alliance Tol'Barad guards. Nothing infuriated me more about having 20 horde just standing around in your base, spamming emotes at you and standing on top of the quest NPCs and nothing being done about it. Also the whole &quot;there's a giant group of Horde waiting to kill you in your own base as you attempt to leave TB after yet another failed attack&quot; thing was ridiculous.<br />
<br />
I can't believe it took them THAT LONG to fix that. Maybe Blizzard was just assuming reports about it was QQ due to the absolute ridiculousness of such a bug.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This was not a much needed hotfix.<br />
<br />
All it does is set TB back to the way it was with one faction (depending on server pop) holding TB all day or most of the day.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bloodwine77</div><div class="date">2011-01-03, 10:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">They should just shut down the TB battleground until it is fixed properly, or change it to where both factions can do Baradin Hold until Tol Barad is fixed.<br />
<br />
I don't think 360 is enough to keep win trading. If it is, then they'll just hotfix it down to 270 and then maybe 180 to make it even for both sides. If you remove win trading, then you go back to one faction controlling the extra dailies and Baradin Hold for 80%+ of the time each week.<br />
<br />
They need just go come out and admit that TB is a horrible mess that should have never made it out of beta in its current design.</div></div><hr />

This is so bad, because you really need the blue set for PvP right now. Other players will slaughter you if you dont have resilience.

<br />
I hope they either buff the honor gain of battlegrounds/world pvp/add honor points to arena after conquest point cap/ or reduce the honor you need to buy the blue items at least.<br />

<br />
I'm sure that they hotfixed it because of the free honor from the bridge haxing - the initial honor hotfix was to encourage wintrading. There's no other way to interpret it, Blizzard isn't that stupid. The honor isn't the real problem though. <br />
<br />
The honest truth is that Tol Barad sucks - the battleground is both boring and imbalanced, the area itself is visually unappealing as hell(compare it to the other non-flight daily hub of Quel'Danas), and the daily quests are some of the most painful I've ever seen. Even with the reputation faction having one of my best trinkets, I have a hard time summoning up the motivation to go grind out another thousand rep each day.</div></div><hr />

Oh yeah and if u are to slow after the change happends, and u find yourself not able to be horde with the rest of your guildies cause u were slow, and now u HAVE to play alliance..To bad for you.<br />
<br />
Sure blizz wold loose oh a million playerbase, but then everything would balance, and after a year players would come back.<br />
<br />
OR HEY another idea!!<br />
use the login system the same as TB, so that only an even base of alliance and horde can log on to a server at one time. If only 1 alliance player plays tonite only 1 horde can.<br />
<br />
Man that would be horrible but talk about balance. <br />
<br />
Besides my nice little rant thats gonna get anhiliated from spelling errors and trolls a like OVIOUSLY the system is broken, and as we all remember wintersgrasp it took them over a year and a half to fix it.

At least this way people got tol barad evenly. If it reverts back to how it was prior to the 1800 we'll end up dealing with the &quot; One faction controls until 4am &quot; crap all over again, while i do admit 1800 was a bit to much i believe that with it blizzard have made a bad decision here balance issue wise. I cannot see them fixing this battleground as it stands.<br />
<br />
One faction controlling it every 2 hours was much better than one faction controlling it the entire day and knowing blizzard from there past records of balancing they've never been good at it.</div></div><hr />

It's not worth win trading for 360 honor.<br />
Defend two times in a row=You hold Baradin Hold &amp; you recieve 360 honor.<br />
Lose-&gt;Win=360 Honor.<br />
<br />
And that wasn't the entire problem. The two problems are/were 1. Win trading was happening on almost every server (not intended). 2. People were using the bridge to exploit for their 1800 honor.<br />

<br />
Agreed, but a minor advantage. The whole point of the 1800 honor was that it was an INCENTIVE for winning a difficult battle. Now for winning a difficult battle we have no incentive(360 honor...). This makes Tol Barad almost pointless to attack unless you're fighting very early in the mornings.</div></div><hr />

Winning as offense grants 360 honor, and destroying each tower adds an additional 20-30 per tower. A win on offense grants 440-450 honor and two wins on defense only give 360. Also, losing grants honor also, so unless 360&gt;500 in your world, win-trading is still more honor.</div></div><hr />

^ Blue post without the blue post. I enjoy earning my rewards legit. But when legit is damn near impossible, you have to do something. Blizz has made some seriously terrible decisions with this place. The balancing of both sides to make for even fights was fine, but the rest of TB is garbage. There have been some thoughts on how to fix it from random websites and all of them are plausible, but to blatantly defend a broken battleground just makes you look like a Blizzard apologist. At this point, Win Trading is a bonus for everybody.<br />
<br />
Oh, by the way. Good job at smearing fecal matter over the problem and assuming it's been fixed, Blizz. Good job at taking away the only reason there was to go into that piece of crap.</div></div><hr />

Let see, 40 ppl are inside, and what with others? We love pvp, and we need sometimes few days to join TB one time. It's impossible to accept.<br />

The macros will work again!<br />
<br />
macro1: (this one counters the main circling strat for offense, anything offense tries is futile, but being organised makes it a joke)<br />
/1 Alright so groups 1-4: NORTH. When you lose north, SLAGS. Lose both? GO NORTH &amp; TURTLE.<br />
/1 Groups 5-8: SOUTHWEST. IF you get outnumbered. Go SLAGS.<br />
<br />
wait a min.<br />
<br />
macro2: (this one is actually valid for offense too)<br />
/1 KILL HEALERS. KILL HEALERS. KILL HEALERS. KILL HEALERS. CC DK. TIME WARP AT ALL TIMES.<br />
/1 KILL HEALERS. KILL HEALERS. KILL HEALERS. KILL HEALERS. KILL HEALERS. KILL HEALERS. <br />
<br />
As always, with 2 minutes left on the timer: Collapse at the same still-standing point. Turtle. Win.<br />
Beware of the alt strat of the backdoor job (or ninja cap on some servers)<br />
<br />
Backdoor Job for OFFENSE:<br />
The backdoor job strat is usually the most successful for a quick win. Difficulty though, is a 5/5 because, mainly, it takes 10 non retarded players to do. <br />
GL getting that, as its hard enough to get that for dungeons, imagine TB.<br />
If done effectively, it will give you a quick win.<br />
The plan consists of letting opponents control 2/3 (that means its written 1/3 in your screen)<br />
<br />
Example: You are ALLIANCE. Opponent is the Horde. <br />
Horde controls North &amp; Slags.<br />
You all attack North. <br />
<br />
When North horde numbers dwindle, 2 groups at north go for a side attack on SLAGS. <br />
Those groups are DK holyP FrostMage Rogue TANK, DK DK RestoDruid DPS DPS.<br />
<br />
DK are insanely OP at the moment for group pvp. Their job consists of peeling off from your healer into the RING OF FROST. They should focus on rogues, and dragging another healer into it as well, then they spam their retarded AOE (hits for 12k-14k with 3.2k resil, 19-21k with 0 resil, and can be spammed 3 times when done right). 3x12k = 36k x 3dk = 108k. This is death for most players.<br />
<br />
Rogue, and the other dps will attack a healer. Very easy to coordinate on vent. TIP: Shaman or druid, they have no invuln. (holy priest have 10s angel, pally has 8s bubble)<br />
<br />
You attack and fight ON THE FLAG. (yes after 6 years, we still have mindless idiots not understand this concept)<br />
Blow up healers. Finish the job. Get ready for an attack on SW.<br />
<br />
IF all goes well, you should win by roughly 3 ticks. However, if one group fails at any place, good luck in 2 hours.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And now, they want to hotfix the bridge &quot;exploit.&quot; Did it ever occur to them that there shouldn't be 50 people standing around outside TB during every battle? That maybe we should actually be allowed to PLAY Tol Barad. Thanks to the win-trading crap, I haven't been able to play an actual game in a week even when I did manage to get in.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;Provide more incentive for the attacking forces to claim victory&quot;<br />
<br />
Yeah, incentive isn't and never was the problem. The problem was a ridiculous win condition that gave the defending team an overwhelming advantage. <br />
<br />
Well, since most people and myself included probably have all their honor PvP gear by now anyway, I'm not complaining.<br />
<br />
Sad that they're fixing the bridge glitch though. Doesn't seem fair to me that a large number of people are denied honor and marks randomly. They really need to change the system to first queue, first serve.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes it will. Horde has already decided here we won't give it up again. Last time we held it for almost a week, we will hold it again. Alliance can QQ all they want about it. They dominated us in wg for over a year while it was broken through just numbers. Paybacks a #$^&amp;. I wasn't a big fan of win trading, still the honor system seems incredibly broken right now. <br />
<br />
Anyway, so yeah we decided that the small amount of honor gained by win trading does not offset the amount of commendations we got for winning. So we will hold it from now on.</div></div><hr />

And for those areas it is always better if the attacker has the advantage, so it will change factions almost every battle - this would be fair for everyone.<br />

<br />
I don't think 360 is enough to keep win trading. If it is, then they'll just hotfix it down to 270 and then maybe 180 to make it even for both sides. If you remove win trading, then you go back to one faction controlling the extra dailies and Baradin Hold for 80%+ of the time each week.<br />
<br />
They need just go come out and admit that TB is a horrible mess that should have never made it out of beta in its current design.<br />
<br />
pretty much this.<br />
<br />
Did anyone noticed that blizz is failing very hard lately, specially talking in a pvp pov ? <br />
<br />
1st thing: I checked that everyone can have gear without any rating required. If once i was excited about getting 1800 fast so i could get my weapons now Im not cause me and everybody else has it. If once I was excitted about getting 2k so i could buy my shoulders now Im not because everyone has it. If once I liked to show off my imba pvp gear now im just like everyone else and this part really pisses me simply because even pve ppl can have the same gear since you just have to do &lt;5 games to cap the CP's. Big big fail here. <br />
<br />
2nd thing: arena MMR exploit. Gave the abusers a hudge advance in gear that might be crucial now since not everyone had the same amount of CP's that they got cause of it . Not mentioning the achievments that they got so easy<br />
<br />
3rd thing: Tol barad failure. If once it was bad, they made it worse with a new possible exploit to the game in order to get more easy pvp gear. Even without the exploit it was still a failure. 1800 was way too much and it was impossible to keep people from win trading.<br />
<br />
4th thing: Rated bgs. Once u get some rating you will start to win 0 rate. Yes win 0. Not mentioning honor<br />
<br />
5th thing: Why in the hell Im still not able to do a premade with my guild without an addon?<br />
<br />
So basically they made the game much more attractive and hard for pve but they did the exact opposite to pvp since in pve you work hard for gear and in pvp you exploit for gear. Even with resets hotfixes etc the dmg as been done and eventho I like to pvp and play wow I feel much less atracted and excited as I was before.</div></div><hr />

<br />
At least I managed to get full pvp set and 2 mounts :P <br />
<br />
Anyway, the system was flawed from the very begining, and my idea of making it an instanced battleground (80vs80 -2 raids- ) never stopped being a possible solution for that matter. Just do the following things:<br />
1. All people in zone are teleported out.<br />
2. Tol Barad bridge is now considered to be part of Tol Barad Peninsula and only past the gates you're considered to be inside the zone, and even if you're in, you'll get teleported out, without recieving any credit for the battle because the battle is not actually in that zone but it's instanced!<br />
3.Making multiple raids might seem to be a little unorthodox, but with the use of other channels, such as General, the communication between the teams could be as good as Raid channel.<br />
4.Because not only 80 people want to fight for each side, make as many instances as possible, for example: 3 Tol Barad fights at same time with 160 people on each game, but with 480 total people.<br />
5.Make a maximum number of Tol Barad instances and each instance has its own status saved! So whenever you queue you're going to join a random Tol Barad without knowing weather you attack or defend.<br />
6.Better rewards! 360 is pretty low. 500 sounds fair for winning! 200 for losing! <br />
7.*But attacking is harder than Defending! why defending should be as rewarding as attacking?* Thats a matter I cannot help, it should be somehow fixed and be as easy to attack as to defend, but I can't think of something atm.<br />
8.Move the dungeon entrance from the region, and the daily questgivers, so everyone, anytime can do Baradin Hold without being tied to the status of the owner of the region.<br />
<br />
<br />
This idea might be a little rough and go against the concept that blizzard has for the zone, but I do not fight for it to come true, I'm just merely suggesting something that could partially help :p</div></div><hr />

Hell, why not just hand it over on a silver platter. If you can't win, then you don't get it. The few times I've done tb where the alliance had it, we had absolutely no trouble taking it back. It's really not that difficult at all. Why should they make it so you get it no matter what happens.<br />

<br />
Think a lot of people missed the point somewhere along the lines. Yes Tol barad was a mess. It was to hard to win on attack and almost un-winnable on high pop servers, but giving out massive honor rewards like 1800 for winning was a terrible band aid fix. It didn't fix the problem, instead it caused new problems like people gearing to full sets of pvp without much effort, making the crafted resi sets worthless and skippable, making battlegrounds, even the call to arms a joke honor reward wise, factions essentially giving up Tol Barad when it came to defending. Oh but yeah, people love free stuff without actually having to earn it! /sarcasm</div></div><hr />

No real pvper worth a damn cares if his opponent/opponents have managed to get gear. You are in it for the fun/challenge. Fighting someone you outgear isn't fun, and it isn't a challenge. You are the type pvper that only plays to enlarge his epeen. The kind that crumples and cries &quot;your class is OP&quot; when you go against anyone with real skill. Please shut the hell up because you give real pvpers a horrible name.<br />
<br />
Aside from that, let's look at what you just said. You have capped honor twice today on your rogue. Now I know someone like you wouldn't dare take advantage of the Tol Barad win trading so we won't count that. <br />
<br />
You get 90 honor for a win. Lets say you get 130 over all for the win, including hks etc. <br />
<br />
The honor cap is 4k, so you are saying you made 8k honor today. At 130 honor per bg you would need to do 62 bgs, and that is winning each one of them. Further, if each bg went a conservative 10 minutes that is 620 minutes. That is 10.3 hours straight. Oh wait, we forgot wait times didn't we. Let's say each bg takes an average of 10 minutes. We all know it's more, but this will make it easier. That doubles our time, so now we have a total of 20.6 hours. That's IF you win every single bg straight. <br />
<br />
Unless you mean to tell us you are a hypocrite and did in fact take advantage of Tol Barad?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Bullshit. Maybe if you are alliance with insta queues and you maintained a perfect winning record I could believe this. If that is the case then, my bad. <br />
<br />
For me as Horde I wait 20-30 minutes only to get a losing fail fest bg most of the time. So I end up with around 45ish honor an hour as I don't get more than 1 bg per hour(obviously this fluctuates a bit depending on the length of the bg). If I were to win half of these in a ten hour period I'd end up with 975 honor for the time spent. This is assuming 1 game per hour and 150 honor per win and 45 per loss.<br />
<br />
TBH It's probably more accurate that I'd get more than one bg an hour. I could probably do 15 in the aforementioned time period. That still isn't anywhere close to 8000 honor a day like you claim and the horde is so fail these days that generous 50% win rate I used is a best case scenario as well. So you are either playing on the best random ally bg teams ever assembled or you are full of crap and just getting off on waving that e-peen around...</div></div><hr />

So back when I was Horde I could bitch 24/7 about the awful long queues, making me wait 30+ minutes for a single BG to pop.<br />
Then changing to Alliance brought me &lt;1m queues, but heh, guess what? The dudes there are so brainless that I tend to think the farming bots could do way more of a fighting than them. Like really, playing a random BG as alliance is like you're on a paralympic team facing a regular team and wondering what the heck is wrong?<br />
If at least I could get a premade group up again and farm the living hell outta them Hordies, but Blizz was smart enough to not allow more than 5 people into regular BGs. Shame RBGs suck too and I couldn't be arsed to do them after spending a day farming it and getting only +0 and occasionaly +1. yesterday I heard even Alliance has 30m queues for RBGs - extremely enjoyable for sure.<br />
<br />
So yeah, I just wanted to vent my frustration of unwillingness to commit the time to farm honor in BGs (100-150 honor per win? What am I? A jobless farmer??) the regular way and now also loosing the option to maybe get 1800 from TB every ~5h.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's pretty much exactly what he said. WoW is a PvE game, with PvP added to attract people interested in it. PvP is not a real part of WoW, and I think it really shows. In games that have PvP build around them, or alongside the PvE the PvP is much more balanced. <br />
<br />
Tol Barad was tested just so you guys know. There were pages, and pages of people on the forums telling them it's messed up. Nothing was done. I personally think it's fine, people saying &quot;make it so we only have to capture two to win&quot; fine, but take out the spires. Make it happen every hour. There are plenty of ways to fix it,and let's be honest. <br />
<br />
WoW is a PvE game, that is pointed out lots. It's true, and the fact is they won't even fix their PvE. What makes you think they give a damn about fixing PvP? The only reason they changed the honor was to bring the grind back to PvP. No real PvPer gives a crap how fast you got your PvP gear. We just want a good fight, and to have fun. They changed it so that people would have to grind more. I like what Bioware said about Grind though (think it was bioware at PAX), Grind is just a way for a game to hide the fact that it doesn't have content. They are right, and people know it.</div></div><hr />

With the defense being able to zerg in a circle, and people not understanding you need to be ahead of the zerg to stop it then the BG becomes a chase and loss.<br />
<br />
There needs to be either more attackers in the BG than defenders, or a damage/health buff like Tenacity. That would make the attacking team now have to organize 40 random people to defend the next node in the zerg, and then have others go and take the other bases</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have to agree. After a little prodding, i was able to urge my guild to jump in and get as much honor as they could as well. I dont think we have a single member without a full set of pvp gear now. NOW normal pvp is equalized without having to do Arena's. Nothing worse then getting Arena babies who get their epic pvp gear stomping on your ass when you just want to do something simple like run a few AVs, WSG's etc.</div></div><hr />

Ideally you don't want to encourage win trading, but the 1800 honor achieved some amount of equilibrium despite Tol Barad's (Fail Barad?) very serious design flaws.

And Blizzard never managed to balance Wintergrasp.<br />

FYI what happened wasn't actually win trading. There was no collusion to trade control of Tol Barad. People just did what was in their best interest. Comparing it to arena is just silly.<br />
<br />
Actually there were reports from multiple realms, mine included, stating the opposite. The general accusations were that the Alliance and Horde were trading control by letting the other side win. As evidence you can look at how nearly impossible it was to win when attacking before the honor increase, and how suddenly it was changing hands every battle after the increase...even though the number of participants didn't change.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That doesn't sound right at all. If you were on the winning team why would you switch servers and take the chance of it being a loosing one? Or switch to the loosing faction on the same server? <br />
<br />
If anything it will make it worse by making people feel that they are missing out on content due to the imbalance of TB thereby having those people faction change to the winning side or server change to a server that wins, which would just bloat the winning sides.<br />
<br />
Hopefully that made sense lol.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Either the 1800 was a bonus for Xmas and they already had plans to lower it, which, it was a ridiculous bonus and you can't even compare the two numbers, showing they either knew it was too much, or they just don't want to hand out PvP gear anymore...<br />
<br />
Or.<br />
<br />
They knew TB was a broken, worthless, failed attempt at a PvP zone, and they put the 1800 to get people in it to complain about it to basically be testers with a bonus for dredging through the...well...crap that it is. And now, the change happened because they have plans to fix TB and make it worth defending, attacking, or even being glanced at on the map.<br />
<br />
They also probably didn't fix the bridge because now the time spent standing there is pointless anyway, so it's a back-burner glitch.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thistlefur</div><div class="date">2011-01-04, 06:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The problem is worse now. On our server at least it was allowed to swap hands every other turn. I say allowed because well you can never get 40 people to agree on everything but if a large number of attackers go all out and a significant number of defenders don't then you get a swap and well it was consistent. Now there is no incentive to do anything. So you get a small group of people that attack hard core while most just wait out the piddly loss honor. On the other side though you get a vast amount who are willing to put in that little effort to get the honor for keeping it, Which on my server means since the &quot;hot fix&quot; hot break more like it the place has not once changed hands. <br />
<br />
Fact is all the PVP BG like WG and TB are BULL@$#^. No one likes them. No one really wants to do them. They are 100% worthless and usually 75% unbalanced. TB for example just means the defender only have to defend 1 spot and they hold. People were fine with the switch. People were fine with the 1800. Now no one cares except for those who are bored or HC PVP which are not the whole player base.<br />
<br />
Return it to like it was or get rid of it. Have both sets of NPC there all the time to give quests. Have the dungeon open to both sides all the time. Either that or make it into a BG [fixed for balance first] so people can gain honor, rep, and the higher form of pvp award but make the world location a quest hub that alternates control every other day. Day one Horde then alliance and back again. No BS battles to win or lose you want to do that go and que for the BG version.</div></div><hr />

It will be reverted back to not being contested zone, but being &quot;horde&quot; zone. The first few weeks i couldn't do dailies and i couldn't do BH, cause on my realm horde was controlling it 24/7.<br />

Why should I and other alliance lose out on PVP upgrades just because we happen to be on the more heavily populated faction ? Surely making it easier for horde to farm honor and so get PVP gear faster will just create more imbalance... they will be far better geared for PVP than my faction in future which will give them a considerable advantage. <br />
<br />
Shame I didn't take full advantage of the exploit while it was there to get a full set of PVP gear as many others did.</div></div><hr />

That way servers that are not balanced will have a much better chance of winning 1/2 the time. I don't care about the actual honor amount personally, I just want to be able to get into the battle EVER. There is literally 1 to 5 alliance MAX in the battle ever.... and yet we(horde) have like 500+ ppl queuing.... if you are lucky you will get into a battle once.&lt;-that is a period BTW.</div></div><hr />

Yesterday on my server there must've been 100 odd people sitting at the bridge to tol barad waiting to skip over the line at the last second. how pathetic.<br />

The whole point of the 1800 honor was that it was an INCENTIVE for winning a difficult battle. Now for winning a difficult battle we have no incentive(360 honor...). This makes Tol Barad almost pointless to attack unless you're fighting very early in the mornings.<br />
<br />
Incentive? For winning a difficult battle? Yeah right. standing around getting 1800 free honor thats what it was all about.<br />
<br />
360 honor for half an hour not enough for you? Good enjoy your 20 minute horde queues, real pvpers instead of leeches such as you will have lots of fun in TB.</div></div><hr />

Bring buffs to uneven sides back. Make the battle challenging. Give real honor rewards, amounts that actually make a person want to fight for their side, but not amounts that are so drastically different that it encourages swapping.

Almost everyone on the realm has a stake in these battles. It provides so much more than honor, and should be treated as world PvP, not an instanced skirmish.<br />

No, for the love of whatever you find divine - NO!<br />
<br />
Wintergrasp was the most biased junk that has been around.<br />
Buffing health and damage for players only made the attacking side never even down a wall if they were heavily outnumbered because the siege vehicles barely managed to get out of the workshop.<br />
Yes, it was fun to hero-mode 1vs20, but once some halfsmart person figured it would be a good idea to CC you - you were dead.<br />
I'm not talking 80 vs 40, i'm talking 80 vs 5 or 80 vs 10 at best.<br />
At least in TB you have a even standing when it comes sheer numbers. Once/If they fix turtling it's a half decent pvp zone. Heck, it's already better than WG imo simply because of the numbers fix.<br />
<br />
While it sucks that a lot of people can't join because the opposing faction don't have enough numbers it is still the better solution.<br />
If your servers player numbers is leaning heavily towards your faction this might even be a way to balance out the unevenness(a long shot, but anything helps).</div></div><hr />

personally I think those who exploited the honour system to gain there gear in this way should have that honour stripped away along with the gear......there is no honour in delibratly losing a battle to exploit an oversight in the currency system and those who sold there souls to the other faction to do so should not be rewarded for it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;What the attacking side lacks is not incentive&quot; - Too true it can be very hard to organise a single raid to do what's needed, multiple raids via zone chat is nigh impossible. Attack right now is too tough but it's close to balanced. A small tweak to the attackers capture rates or a change in spawn points would be all that's required to even it out on my server (Sylvanas-EU-Alliance)<br />
<br />
I like the idea that holding 2/3 bases as time expires = win and 3 bases = instant win. The turtling inside one base tactic is frustrating at best, yes it makes players fight players but AOEing the bottlenecks isn't exactly what pvp was mean to be. 2/3 to win conditions would force alot more movement from the defense and would create a much more interesting dynamic due to the 3 bases in play.<br />
<br />
*OT*<br />
Finally I think you should drop the amount of honor required to get gear with. PvP should be more about skill and less about gear. I'd like to see the pvp armor being hammered down in cost but prevent it being used in a PvE environment either by a stacking debuff inside instances something along the lines of -5% damage per item worn (perhaps excluding 2200 weapons) or by dropping it's ilvl completely so it counts as a 0 in the LFG system.<br />
<br />
So that's my 2c, haven't had my coffee yet so I can only hope it's coherant :)</div></div><hr />

However it does nothing for my lack of faith in Blizzards capabilities to balance Tol Barad. Especially when you consider that Tol Barad is, in Blizzards own words, partially like Wintergrasp. And Blizzard never managed to balance Wintergrasp.<br />

Actually there were reports from multiple realms, mine included, stating the opposite. The general accusations were that the Alliance and Horde were trading control by letting the other side win. As evidence you can look at how nearly impossible it was to win when attacking before the honor increase, and how suddenly it was changing hands every battle after the increase...even though the number of participants didn't change.<br />
It doesn't matter. The motivation for losing on defense was that you would get tons more honor next time when you attack. There's nothing in the ToS that says you can't do what will provide you with the optimal outcome. Its simple game theory. Losing on defense/letting your opponent win on offense is clearly the equilibrium.</div></div><hr />

But I would not say it was &quot;without effort&quot; . After all i even woke up one hour early each day to check if i can join a TB before i got to go to work ! Man that sucked ! Also logging in all 5 hours when Horde was attacking only because i COULD possibly get into TB to earn points. The way it is now i can again just check if TB is running and join if i got free time. Thanks Blizzard ! <br />
<br />
The Bridge exploit really sucked, i had that feeling that everyone was getting points for free except me ! Since i was portat back to Orgrimar everytime i tried . . . Well i am full equiped now. But i would have been anyway even if queueing for BGs. One weak BGs would have granted me eaven more points than just logging in and hoping for a lottery. And even would have been more fun !

&quot;OMG, Horde was actually fighting back last time! I say we ditch win trading and never let them have TB again!!&quot;<br />

Had a good laugh, since the Horde on my server can win this thing with their hands tied to their back. Hell, the only time I saw alliance winning, Horde won it right back the fight after.<br />

Edit: Just remembered another cracker. On time during the 1800 honor phase, There were people advertising in trade to grab up your free honor points. That fight Alliance didn't succeed in attacking even though Horde tried to lose. Wow.</div></div><hr />

Sure people started win trading, but it wasn't exactly their fault. Also, I'm not sure if you noticed, but it's the holiday's and I'm sure a lot of dev's were out of the office which -may- explain why there hasn't been a fix yet. They also stated they're going to be working on making some changed to Tol Barad and will update us through blog posts and whatnot.<br />
<br />
If you don't like it, don't play it. Simple as that. And stop getting so damn mad about a video game.<br />
<br />
It's the holidays and it's exactly why they shouldn't do such a change if they're not there to monitor it and fix a possible exploit.<br />
<br />
You go out for holidays just to come back and find that everyone now has a huge gap in resilience compared to you that they shouldn't have for just one week. Great to start the year playing and get destroyed by even bad players that just &quot;bridged&quot; their entire pvp set and tons of resilience.<br />
<br />
To fix it, Blizz would just need to apply a fix in line with the one they did for the arena exploit, but with a few extra stuff by using armory feed stats for gear obtained during this &quot;1800 tarding festival&quot; week and played time of each player for the week, calculating a average honor gain based on just BGs and 360 honor TB win and removing or disabling the gear they bough after the &quot;max honor&quot; they could have for the period. But they won't do it, of course.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Set win condition to attacker holding 2 of 3 at end, giving attacking a slight advantage but a spirited defense can easily hold one and contest one.<br />
<br />
Correct answer plus allowing for 'skill' factors: set win to holding 2 of 3 at end, plus add a reinforcements counter, allowing strategic defense to bleed out the attackers, and stupid defense to bleed themselves dry zerging.<br />
<br />
Correct answer to fixing Tol Barad while keeping the current win condition:<br />
<br />
Double the map size/distance from center to control points. Break zerging, require coordinated defense/offense to win.<br />
<br />
Cheap answer to fixing Tol Barad while keeping the current win condition:<br />
<br />
Remove the use of ground mounts while the battle is active.<br />

Yeah... because they really tested PvE in beta and it's not full of bugs and... oh wait.<br />
<br />
Beta serves for two purposes only, players to create their leveling strategies for realm's 1st achievements and selected guilds to learn the raid content to blow up everything in their path as possible when it goes live.<br />

<br />
That's pretty much exactly what he said. WoW is a PvE game, with PvP added to attract people interested in it. PvP is not a real part of WoW, and I think it really shows. In games that have PvP build around them, or alongside the PvE the PvP is much more balanced. <br />
<br />
Tol Barad was tested just so you guys know. There were pages, and pages of people on the forums telling them it's messed up. Nothing was done. I personally think it's fine, people saying &quot;make it so we only have to capture two to win&quot; fine, but take out the spires. Make it happen every hour. There are plenty of ways to fix it,and let's be honest. <br />
<br />
WoW is a PvE game, that is pointed out lots. It's true, and the fact is they won't even fix their PvE. What makes you think they give a damn about fixing PvP? The only reason they changed the honor was to bring the grind back to PvP. No real PvPer gives a crap how fast you got your PvP gear. We just want a good fight, and to have fun. They changed it so that people would have to grind more. I like what Bioware said about Grind though (think it was bioware at PAX), Grind is just a way for a game to hide the fact that it doesn't have content. They are right, and people know it.<br />
<br />
There will never be enough content, unfortunately.</div></div><hr />

Nothing worse then getting Arena babies who get their epic pvp gear stomping on your ass when you just want to do something simple like run a few AVs, WSG's etc.<br />

Unfortunately wasn't the case for the marjority of the player base who didn't play during the holidays, that happens.<br />

You, sir, are grossly incorrect, but I know hyperbole makes the world go round.<br />
I was in Beta, and trust me, they did a ton of tweaking. Problem is any time you put something new down, software, hardware, etc. There will always be things that will &quot;fracture&quot; because of it. It's how it works in the IT world too. You can test something for months, have it apparently all good to go, put it in a live environment, and something new you never predicted will happen. And then if you fix that, something else will break. etc, etc...<br />
<br />
As for raiding bugs and DPS levels, sure, they could see what folks were doing in regular dunegons, and heroics, but the raids were only available for set times each night, and only specific groups really worked on those. They now have a much, much larger chunk of people to look at, playstyles (from the pros to the 'noobs') to compare, and get an actual solid comparison now.<br />
<br />
In conclusion, I thought Tol Barad was just for the enriched pyrium nodes. &gt;_&gt; &lt;_&lt;</div></div><hr />

Keep in mind that honor is only used as currency for the first tier of PvP gear, and as such, there's only so much that people should have to farm. <br />
I mean really.. 2200 honor for a set part, 1600 for some slots and 1200 for the rest. If you add up a full set, it's gonna take VERY long to farm. <br />
<br />
For my part, I really can't be bothered to farm yet another season of PvP gear. It's the same every season, except now it's even more stupid.<br />
How I see it, it should be EASY to get the first tier of PvP gear. Not hard or boring - EASY! That way we would get to see more arena action, as alot of people would have access to the gear. For the good arena players, it wouldn't be too big of a hassle to get full Vicious gear, but it would for the bad players.<br />
Just dont make the first, blue gear so boring to farm that you scare newcommers -or oldies away from the PvP scene!<br />

PVP is meant to be a side thing. If it takes a long time it takes a long time. People are going to whine, but people are still going to play regardless.</div></div><hr />

I would really like to see your source of that. PvP is part of the game and adding arenas and now rated battlegrounds proves how much. The poster above have point in cost of pvp gear, it also doesnt drop from players when you kill them (as pve items do from mobs). So you should really rethink what you just said.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A side thing? Pardon me, but I totally disagree.<br />
PvP in WoW is by far the most competitive aspect of the game. You dont see major tournaments on &quot;Who can kill this boss the fastest&quot; - Atleast not in the same way as you do with PvP. In case you're wondering, I'm talking about Blizzcon etc.<br />
Also, how can you go and call something a &quot;side thing&quot;, when it's been a part of the game since like.. forever? Some people play WoW for the PvE content, others play it for the PvP content. And oh, some play the game to do both. *:o*<br />
<br />
And really, it's not about whine.</div></div><hr />

That's when most people like to queue for this broken BG.<br />
<br />
Now that win-trading is over and one faction will hold TB mostly forever ( or until next fix ) , there's no reason for members of the attacking faction to join a 30min whack-a-mole game you can't win 99% of the time. If only 8 attackers join , only 8 defenders will get to participate. No one wins actually.</div></div><hr />
