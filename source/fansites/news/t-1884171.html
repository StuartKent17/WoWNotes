Blizzcon - Engineering Panel Update<br />
One final update on the fate of the Engineering Panel that turned out not to be a panel.<br />
Quick updates on Engineering discussion. First, it's a Q&amp;A discussion in the Darkmoon Faire area, not a panel on one of the panel stages. Second, it's gonna be at 12:15 on Saturday, and last for an hour. We'll be doing some of the questions we got from Twitter, and polling the audience. The engineers involved are myself, @ben_deane from http://Battle.Net , Timothy Ford from Overwatch, and Grant Mark from SC2/HOTS. We're super excited to do this, and we have a lot of good questions you've submitted. Thanks for your involvement. (kurtismcc (https://twitter.com/kurtismcc/status/656956435360710656))<br />
<br />
I was wrong about the virtual ticket. I misunderstood something from an earlier meeting. I'm sorry I got your hopes up. (kurtismcc (https://twitter.com/kurtismcc/status/656476056577142784))<br />

Blue Posts<br />
Buffs in Arenas and Timewalking<br />
This is intended behaviour. When you zone into Timewalking Dungeons, certain buffs will be cleared and will need to be re-cast. This is necessary for clean down-scaling.<br />
<br />
In the case of Arena, this is to stop players loading up on various buffs that they would not normally be able to receive while in an Arena match.

Blizzard announced the purpose of the Battle.Net Voice Chat that we mentioned a few days ago (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/5200-Battle-Net-Voice-Chat-Blizzcon-Engineering-Panel-Update-Oct-19-Hotfixes-Final-Boss).<br />
Greetings, heroes!<br />
<br />
We're in the process of working in some slight updates to Battle.net in preparation for the upcoming Overwatch beta test (http://us.battle.net/overwatch/en/blog/19919176/), and wanted to give you the heads up. This update will lay the foundation for us to test voice chat functionality within the Overwatch beta. <br />
<br />
We're excited for players to give this feature a try during the Overwatch beta and look forward to your feedback. Further details on our voice chat plans for Battle.net will be released further down the road, but for now, please see the FAQ below.<br />
<br />
Q: If I'm not in the Overwatch beta test, can I still test voice chat?<br />
A: Battle.net voice chat will only be available for testing in the Overwatch beta. Players are welcome to sign up for the beta here (http://blizz.ly/JoinOverwatch).<br />
<br />
Q: Will voice chat support other Blizzard games as well? If so, when?<br />
A: With voice chat still in its early development and testing stages, it's too early to say which Blizzard games will be supported and when. <br />
<br />
Q: How will voice chat work in the Overwatch beta test?<br />
A: We'll have further details to share once the beta begins.<br />
<br />
Q: Should I see some sort of change with my Battle.net desktop app?<br />
A: No, this is just be an addition to the app's DLLs. <br />

Activision Blizzard Creates eSports Division<br />
Activision Blizzard, Inc. (Nasdaq: ATVI) today announced a new division that will build on the Company's competitive gaming leadership by creating all-new ways to deliver the best-in-class fan experience across games, platforms and geographies, furthering the development of its world-leading esports ecosystem. Former CEO of ESPN and the NFL Network Steve Bornstein will serve as the division's Chairman and Mike Sepso, who was most recently a co-founder and president of Major League Gaming (MLG), will serve as its Senior Vice President.<br />
<br />
&quot;Celebrating our players and their unique skill, dedication and commitment is the essence of our esports initiatives,&quot; said Bobby Kotick, Chief Executive Officer of Activision Blizzard. &quot;Blizzard Entertainment and Activision Publishing have been leaders in the development of esports. With that leadership, our strong franchises, our deep history and experience in esports, and now two additional industry leaders, we intend to further enhance our efforts and make certain this remains an important growth driver for Activision Blizzard.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kotick added, &quot;There are no better leaders for this new initiative than Steve and Mike. Steve has unparalleled experience in creating a sports network powerhouse and his groundbreaking leadership at ESPN and the NFL Network shaped how the whole world experiences sports. Mike's entrepreneurial vision helped make ‘esports' a household word and he is uniquely positioned to take the experience to the next level.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Last year, Activision Blizzard created entertainment that was viewed and played by over 150 million people for more than 13 billion hours,&quot; said Steve Bornstein, Chairman of the new division and former CEO of ESPN and the NFL Network. &quot;I believe esports will rival the biggest traditional sports leagues in terms of future opportunities, and between advertising, ticket sales, licensing, sponsorships and merchandising, there are tremendous growth areas for this nascent industry. I'm excited to help Activision Blizzard further its leadership position in esports.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;As a member of the esports community for over 12 years, I couldn't be more excited for the future of the sport. I am confident that the company's industry-leading content will capture the many opportunities we have to entertain and celebrate our players,&quot; said Mike Sepso, Senior Vice President for Activision Blizzard. &quot;Activision Blizzard is uniquely positioned to give millions of fans around the world what they want, and I'm excited to help support this community in a way that honors its history.&quot;<br />
<br />
Activision Blizzard has a rich history in esports:<br />
<br />
<br />
Blizzard Entertainment's StarCraft® was the early pioneer in large-scale mainstream, televised esports, since the 1990s.<br />
Blizzard Entertainment has many of the world's biggest and most beloved esports competitions. This year's BlizzCon® event will take place November 6-7 in Anaheim, Calif. and will feature the global finals for StarCraft® II, World of Warcraft®, Heroes of the Storm™ and Hearthstone®. Players have been competing for more than $4 million in prizes across Road to BlizzCon tournaments.<br />
Earlier this year, Blizzard Entertainment launched Heroes of the Dorm™, the first collegiate esports event to be televised on ESPN2. More than 6,000 collegiate players, representing 460-plus schools, competed in the tournament with the winning team from UC Berkeley securing the grand prize of fully-paid tuition for each of its members.<br />
Activision Publishing hosts the annual Call of Duty Championship. Call of Duty® is the top console esports franchise in the world.<br />
On September 24, 2015, Activision Publishing announced the creation of the Call of Duty® World League, which provides a $3 million prize pool to professional and amateur players.<br />
Since its launch, Destiny has become the most watched console game on Twitch.</div></div><hr />

I think all of the parties are at the Hilton this year. Wowhead, Curse, CTR, AskMrRobot/WorldofRaids(Con before the Storm). It's going to be insane.<br />

Newegg is elsewhere, but I'm only vaguely interested in that one.</div></div><hr />

And that's why they call it an eSport. They still train hard, and have to put in just as much time and effort as a physical athlete. Plus there are massive tournaments every year with tournaments such as The International or the 2015 LoL championships drawing more viewers than the Superbowl and huge teams with highly expensive sponsorship deals, I guess the rest of the world disagrees with you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They had more stream viewers than the Super Bowl's stream. Most people prefer to watch the Super Bowl on broadcast. E-sports are still small compared to regular sports and it will never be in the near future considering its dynamic nature, the recognition of its players and the money shifting into more casual markets. Sports like football and soccer have been around for decades, I don't think LoL or Dota are going to be around or at least popular in 10 or 20 years. Starcraft and Counter-Strike anyone? By then people will move on to other games.</div></div><hr />

Starcraft was first a fun game that accidentally became an &quot;e-sport&quot;. It &quot;successor&quot; LoL was very much the same, a fun game first and foremost, that accidentally became the leading e-sport game.<br />
<br />
Now Blizzard is deliberately creating an e-sport division to chase the money.<br />

From this point forth, &quot;fun&quot; will probably take a backseat to &quot;broadcast-ability&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Of all their games the least popular for esports competitions would be World of Warcraft Arena, its something that really haven't take off, unless you play WoW and you like PvP &amp;/or arena most people outside of that just don't grasp the concept of what is happening and the &quot;complexity of it&quot; plus is not even that fun watching it.<br />
<br />
That is because it isn't at all complex... arenas have been boring players to death for years, competitive rock paper scissors would be more interesting</div></div><hr />

Do you have any idea how many complaints ESPN got when they put up a moba tournament one night? Do you think people who watch and play in esports are the majority? What kind of little world do you live inside?<br />
<br />
Kek, you do realize that the biggest esport final of the last 2 years (LoL) had more viewers then the finals of the MLB and NBA combined?<br />
And although dota2 fans pay through their noses while Valve laughs there way to the bank, that 18m prize pool for Ti5 is more the some sports/teams have as a budget??<br />
<br />
tbh, i myself don't like the esport name, it has to many similarities to that shit that is backed by degenerates that call themselves &quot;fans/supporters/hooligans&quot;<br />
Competitive gaming would be a better word, but e-sports just sounds better so we have to make do with that.<br />
<br />
And any company that strives to make it a success, even EA/Blizzard, has a point up in my book.<br />
They may be in it for the money, but money and &quot;sports&quot; are a vastly intertwined now days<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Provide those numbers plz with references and some type of comparative context to any other complaints they receive. Else, its just your pet theory with zero facts to back it up<br />
<br />
There was a major backlash, and it was stupid what that radio host did. But that is his view and as much as i disagree he is entitled to his opinion.<br />

Jesus christ dude. The majority of people on this fucking planet watch real sports and laugh at the idea of esports. It's just fucking common sense. I play world of warcraft, this is coming from someone who thinks sports are stupid and don't watch them. It's like denying katy perry and taylor swift are popular. Wake the fuck up.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mmocf93f59e44c</div><div class="date">2015-10-24, 04:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">eSport is a sport according to the definition provided by SportAccord.<br />
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport#Definition<br />
<br />
<br />
SportAccord uses the following criteria, determining that a sport should:[1]<br />
<br />
have an element of competition<br />
be in no way harmful to any living creature<br />
not rely on equipment provided by a single supplier (excluding proprietary games such as arena football)<br />
not rely on any &quot;luck&quot; element specifically designed into the sport<br />
<br />
The luck part is the only one that might not make games like LoL or DotA a sport because it has critical hits. But then there is also these distinctions they make for different kind of sports.<br />
<br />
<br />
They also recognise that sport can be primarily physical (such as rugby or athletics), primarily mind (such as chess or go), predominantly motorised (such as Formula 1 or powerboating), primarily co-ordination (such as billiard sports), or primarily animal-supported (such as equestrian sport).[1]<br />
<br />
So, yes, a video game can be a sport if we are to follow the definition that SportAccord uses. And for those who do not know who they are:<br />
<br />
SportAccord, which is the association for all the largest international sports federations (including association football, athletics, cycling, tennis, equestrian sports and more), and is therefore the de facto representative of international sport.<br />
<br />
<br />
We're all free to think what we want, so by all mean, you can be of the opinion that a video game can not be a sport (or eSport), but there is no need to try to belittle other people just because you do not agree with them.</div></div><hr />
