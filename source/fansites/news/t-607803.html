Blizzcast Episode 3 in the works<br />
It's been a few weeks since the 2nd Blizzcast, and people have been wondering if the project is still alive or not ... Nethaera answers.<br />
A third one is in the works. We just had some unforeseen delays we had to work out. We definitely want to make these more regular releases, however, they depend heavily on getting many people and resources together.<br />
<br />
I'm a part of the BlizzCast process (you can hear me in the second one). We have never stated this would be weekly, though we would like to be consistent on monthly releases. We've only released two BlizzCasts so far and we are still nailing down a process that works best for us. I personally listen to many podcasts and think they are great, but they definitely work within different constraints than we do.<br />
<br />
We're doing what we can to get these out to you and hoping we can just keep improving with every release of it.<br />

Gotfrag's Know Your Enemy: Druid<br />
A few days ago, Gotfrag (http://www.gotfrag.com/wow/story/42330/) released the first part of their &quot;Get Better Fast&quot; series focused on WoW. This article take a deep look at the resto-spec Druids in arenas and the abilities they might use against you, if you never played a druid you'll probably learn a few things here.<br />

The pre-expansion lull will also consume it's share of guilds, it certainly did before BC, and we've seen it a bit already again.<br />
<br />
Of course I haven't raided hard since Naxx racing, but I sure as hell would be taking a break from it now with no 2.5 and LK on the horizon. <br />
<br />
I had planned to play Age of Conan with some friends during the LK wait, but after fiddling in the open beta, I have come to the conclusion that one Funcom turd in Anarchy Online was enough for a life time. How the fuck did anyone think that combat and shield system would be any good on anything other than a bullet point?</div></div><hr />

<br />
so scroll down...?<br />
<br />
I read the farewell post on the D&amp;T site and I just feel for them. The guilds I raided with pre BC and BC were the same way, though they were never has hardcore, they just pretended to be. When the &quot;officers&quot; got their T2 8 piece set they screwed over the rest of us by saying they were retiring until BC. Rats jumped ship, the loyal were screwed over unable to raid without a full raid. In BC tanks thought they were allowed to do whatever they wanted and went AWOL when they pleased. As the feral MT/OT I was the only reliable one, which in BC 25 man encounters, you need more than one tank and sometimes people with shields. <br />
<br />
People suck.</div></div><hr />

there are A LOT of factual mistakes in the article. even some advice i would consider damaging to performance vs a druid opponent. :P i was scrolling down the comments on the GotFrags website to put up a list of errors, but turns out someone else had already done so. the author of the article apparently hadnt bothered to do simple research, and as of the time of writing this, has not rectified his erroneous statements.<br />

Most numbers are unaccurate and most comments reflect the fact that the writer hasn't played a druid on pvp, specially when he talks about mana costs(swiftmend expensive? wtf? max rank roots/FF??).<br />

Agreed. It's getting harder and harder to get arena epics (what with the new S4 requirements), and it's getting easier and easier to get epics from raiding.</div></div><hr />

He is wrong in many points and misinformation about some druid abilities. Like Barkskin, he says it makes you uninterruptible, which is not true. It just prevent pushback.<br />

You really should remove that from front page.</div></div><hr />

Yeah<br />
<br />
<br />
Barkskin – This 12 second duration ability was added to a Druid’s arsenal in patch 2.1<br />
Barkskin was introduced years before 2.1, 2.1 just nerfed the duration to 12 seconds.<br />
<br />
Really poor writing.</div></div><hr />
