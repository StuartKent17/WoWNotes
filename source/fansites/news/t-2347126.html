Yeah, I think so too. That's not &quot;bits and pieces&quot; like Lore said on the US forum. &quot;Bits and pieces&quot; are some models for me...not complete characters with voice lines, mounts, heritage-armor etc.</div></div><hr />

Wowhead's BroadcastText list of emotes has a Highmountain Tauren Male one that is missing from the game files - &quot;Trust me... I have experience at exploring deep places.&quot;<br />

There's a couple gaps in the middle of the Lightforged Draenei Male section as well in the game files.</div></div><hr />

Nothing is missing there. Very few in outside world, less than 1% total.<br />

Lol okay buddy. Newsflash: some people like the same sex. And you know what? It's really no big deal unless you make it one.<br />
It really is not a big deal until you should not try to normalize it. Also most flirts, if not all are sex neutral. Let's them stay sex neutral without bringing unncessary filth.</div></div><hr />

It really is not a big deal until you should not try to normalize it. Also most flirts, if not all are sex neutral. Let's them stay sex neutral without bringing unncessary filth.<br />
<br />
Can't determine if you're trying to say it shouldn't be normalized or it shouldn't NOT be normalized. If it's the latter, there are more efficient ways to say that, but yeah for sure I'm all aboard. If it's the former, I go back to my previous comment - it's no big deal unless you make it one. You really just shouldn't care about this.</div></div><hr />

Sorry, mistake happened there. It should not be normalized. It is a big deal. And the same argument can be attributed to any kind of deviation from the norm. Flirts should stay gender neutral.</div></div><hr />

ONE flirt.. ONE out of.. 50+? Something like that.. One flirt has something outside the norm and you're gonna throw a fit about it.. It's people like you that make me lose faith in humanity.<br />

They are suprisingly sexual in nature compared to the original races flirt. Love it, especially the light Draenei.<br />

Yes. It should most definitely not go through. Let's keep flirts gender neutral and don't start the whole LGBTQWERTY nonsense. I don't remember any other race having sex specific flirts, and if they are such then let's not add more.</div></div><hr />

Geeks are a deviation from the norm. Time to snuff out World of Warcraft I guess.<br />

This is not true at all. You and the lobby you support try to make it as regular, normalized thing. But it is not. And should not be. There were always a lot of geeks, bieng a geek is a norm. Geek is nothing more than person who likes books etc. Unless you speak of some very narrow definition.<br />

<br />
Imo, there's no need for the flirts to not be gender neutral. Some of us play games to escape the drama/gender issues of the outside world(oddly enough). In this case, I'd rather not hear what gender my toon/character is written/vo'd to prefer. However, if the line stays in, it's no big deal though. /shrug<br />

To digress, I will say that the voice actors for the new races are pretty damn good.</div></div><hr />

Which is neutral. The very phrase can and should be interpreted as 'deliquent', maybe 'boyfriend thief' more than what you think it means. It is widely used in real life and comes in many forms such as 'you are the type of person my parents warned me about'. What she is implying in this flirt message is nothing more than 'listen, I'm naughty'.</div></div><hr />

i do agree they should stay neutral, but your reasoning is out of hate and it's not cool.<br />
<br />
they shouldn't indicate a sexuality, and this joke about tyrande(it's a /silly, not a /flirt) is problematic because it makes the player nightborne 10k years old. so now we have age and sexuality set for us, and that hurts RP factor. they should remove references to gender and age in the flirts and sillies imo.</div></div><hr />
