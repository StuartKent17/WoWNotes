Moreover, how does making them BoP stop this, exactly? You can buy gold, buy gear from AH, obliterate gear from AH, upgrade gear from AH with Obliterum. It changes exactly NOTHING. And in fact encourages this behavior.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm not really that much of a classic-nostalgia dweller but you have actually a point. It was much more interesting to get all those obscure materials back then. Even if they were from vendors like different dyes and threads. Having only one general material gives you a feel like you are one-man child-labor-using factory from china which makes tons of crappy stuff from cheap plastic.</div></div><hr />

I thought I saw a recipe for blacksmithing created large armored war turtle mount for legion that was datamined.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Murthera</div><div class="date">2016-06-23, 08:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Are these guys F-ning crazy? They say one thing and then do the totally opposite. Well, they probably have finally broken my of my addiction to WoW.<br />
1] They say they want to maximize the player's &quot;class fantasy&quot;, but then they come out and say they are going to railroad you into how to play: &quot;The team doesn't want you to have to have a full set of alts to play the game as effectively as possible.&quot;... Part of my fantasy in the game was to be able to play any of the classes to the best of my ability, now I will be forced to focus on only one or two.<br />
2] The gear we will be able to make with the BOP BoS that we painstakingly grind will be BOE and can be sold on the AH, yet the reason for BoS to be BoP is: &quot;There are reasons they can't make Blood of Sargeras Bind on Account. They don't want players to be able to buy a full set of raid gear for gold, especially when you can buy gold through the WoW Token.&quot; All I can say is WTF!?! That essentially says &quot;We don't want you to be able to craft all the gear at once YOURSELF, but buying it all at once is OK. *FACEPALM* But then again, this is the team that succeeded in getting the international symbol for gold changed from &quot;Au&quot; to &quot;Fu&quot;, because that's what all those bags of gold in lieu of gear (or the vendor gold for the 13th repeat item) sure felt like.<br />
3] Another indication that the reasoning behind #2 is too rectal-cranially inverted is: &quot;People with lots of gold can buy a full set of gear and use Obliterum to upgrade it, but they have to play to earn Blood of Sargeras to do so.&quot; Which totally invalidates the original thought. Again.... WTF!?!<br />
4] Having to have BoS to make gear just to &quot;obliterate&quot; it to upgrade gear is a circular argument they seem to be following: &quot;No stat rerolling item this time, as there are reasons to craft more items this time. You will have to make lots of items to turn into Obliterum to fully upgrade crafted gear.&quot;... Sounds like this is turning into World of Gather-for-Crafting.<br />
That's my $0.02, but I'm sure the majority of the uber &amp; elitist WoW community won't care as I, being a Truly CASUAL player was never able to raid much and never past *gasp* Normal. Nope, i was a mere LFReject who was happy with playing the game for fun and enjoying the lore. Note i used the past tense, because if things continue on the current trajectory, WoD will be the last expansion I buy and play.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is nothing &quot;iconic&quot; about that recipe, the food was barely even used in vanilla cause it was not worth farming the mats on that shitty island. Also they only talked about old things that were actual items like armor pieces with unique appearances.<br />
<br />

Yeah, you're definitely right -- this is a bit concerning. If the craftables only go up for normal mode raid gear, mythic dungeons will probably crush them. Craftables were appealing in HFC because they went up to heroic ilvl with the perfect secondaries, arguably better on some slots until mid-hfc mythic</div></div><hr />

<br />
It seems like they're embarrassed. There was an issue with bloods, they couldn't figure out how to fix it. The community said just make it account bound, problem solved. Now they're embarrassed for not thinking of it themselves so in order to save face they're going through a bunch of mental gymnastics trying to come up with reasons why that wouldn't work. Just swallow your pride and fix the fucking issue.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It also seems Blizzard doesn't want as people using their alts as utility characters, which is a shame for me considering that's what I have:/ With this set up, I guess I'll have to learn how to play these characters in a dungeon environment so I can learn all their basic profession plans.</div></div><hr />

They said they do not want us to be able to buy crafted gear to bypass gearing up. So they will not make the bloods BOA/BOE – but we will use them to craft gear which is BOE. Now if I craft a BOE item and sell it on the AH, another person can buy it and crush it to make the item upgrade and upgrade their gear.<br />
<br />
Doesn’t that defeat the whole purpose?<br />
<br />
Couldn’t I buy a leather item with the stats that are best for my class. Then buy all the cheapest pieces on the AH, take them and crush them up and craft a bunch of upgrades and upgrade my bought gear? So all I have to do is have gold and the ability to make the upgrades…</div></div><hr />

This whole expansion feels like it's shaping up to be a LOT of polish on a VERY big turd. Lazy is the only word that I feel really describes their approach to Professions, Class Design and Storytelling. I mean, they say time and again that they can't please everyone... so it sounds like they're done with trying to please anyone but their corporate figureheads.<br />

a roleplaying game has to have complexity to the umpteenth degree because people playing the game have to have something new to do every time they log on. With an MMO RPG they already have it easy with player-to-player interaction, so they should just focus on giving us the tools to make the game fun for ourselves. Instead they seem to make everything SOOOO linear and SOOOOOOOOOOO simplified that there's no individuality, no real sense of achievement beyond &quot;yay, the boss is dead, I MIGHT get something I can use.&quot; What's wrong with you Blizz?<br />

Really, your comments on Legion are nothing new, sadly.<br />
<br />
All this created a shitstorm of problems, but the one that specifically affects crafting is that the &quot;each patch makes all previous content obsolete&quot; approach means there's little point to crafting anything aside from gems, flasks, pots, and item enhancements (enchants, scopes, etc). WoD tried a bandaid with the stage 1-6 gear, but when you have Timeless Jungle balefuls and the lower difficulties of $CurrentRaid giving better gear, it's not enough.<br />
<br />
If they really were serious about fixing things, they'd return to the model where you have to complete Tier N to survive Tier N +1. In that scenario, crafted items were valuable as they provided boosts to help progression.</div></div><hr />

Nah, minimum character limit on comments is 10. So if you write something shorter than 10 characters, you add /10char(aracters).</div></div><hr />

It will prevent a garrison style forced-alt fapfest where people grind their brains out for BoS. They did explain their concerns especially if you watch the stream. BoS is one of the first things they talk about they answer like 4 questions about them in depth where even the twitch chat thought it was reasonable.

It reminds me of that cave in The Little Mermaid where all those little shriveled up fucked up monsters just kinda wiggled around.

Well, in WoD I made a killing selling gear, and upgrade items for said gear, because the gear was actually good for many people. Granted a good chunk of that was barn mostly and the savage bloods from them, but still it made crafting actually profitable, at least early on.</div></div><hr />

There was an issue with bloods, they couldn't figure out how to fix it. The community said just make it account bound, problem solved. Now they're embarrassed for not thinking of it themselves so in order to save face they're going through a bunch of mental gymnastics trying to come up with reasons why that wouldn't work. Just swallow your pride and fix the fucking issue.<br />
<br />
Sadly, it seems you could apply this to any number of issues of the game with this current dev team, but them admitting they might be wrong seems to be truly beyond the realms of possiblity at this point. They, and WoW, are infallible. They define and enforce fun, strictly.</div></div><hr />

Actually garrisons were different in that the gathering professions were largely irrelevant in 2 cases out of 3.<br />
Therefore it is completely different.<br />
Having the choice of two gathering professions does not make it grindy, as it isn't an outright superior choice to 1 crafting/1 gathering.<br />
If blizzard want to enforce the 1 of each, then merge them together.<br />
Professions should be a choice.<br />
Here they are removing that choice.</div></div><hr />

Its so much more interesting. Although its funny how once I hit the champion point threshold for best ilv gear I could literally buy a full set of crafted armor for my stamina Templar minus a few pieces that are a bit rare like a neck or ring of agility. Also, Cyrodil is awesome. The way there are constant battles at different nodes/outposts/keeps and there is a score that is kept over the course of a week/a month is really cool. Only problem is getting into guilds because they seem to be pretty exclusive and for some reason people refuse to invite people to groups in zone chat.</div></div><hr />

I wasn't talking about that, I was referring to the behavior of a lot of people who managed full garrisons and missions all day on multiple alts to maximize their gold gains; as indicated by my statement &quot;(They're trying to prevent a) garrison style forced-alt fapfest where people grind their brains out for BoS&quot;<br />
<br />
I'm not completely sure wtf you're talking about with the rest of that, but they specifically said that they arent 'enforcing' anyones professions. They already explained the way they plan on dealing with double-crafters and during the interview the words 'we don't want anyone to drop a profession over this' were uttered more then once.<br />
<br />
If-then statements are very good for framing discussions and proving points but not if they're disconnected to begin with.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We are going to disagree on that.<br />
They have &quot;concerns&quot; about problems only made by their &quot;preferred&quot; design of 1 crafting 1 gathering.<br />
Double crafters are not optimal, so they have to &quot;fix&quot; that with more sources.<br />
Double gatherer's are not optimal either, so again that is another they are now scrambling to &quot;fix&quot; after the playerbase has made it clear they don't want to be pidgeonholed into combinations blizzard deemed acceptable.<br />
<br />
Blizzard dictated that we should only play certain combinations, and the players made it clear that wasn't good enough.</div></div><hr />
