<br />
Highlights<br />
<br />
Battle for Azeroth will release on August 14, 2018!<br />
Dark Iron Dwarves and Mag'har Orcs will be the first two new Allied Races. Play through the War Campaign at release and unlock them.<br />
Kul'Tiran and Zandalari Trolls will come later in the expansion.<br />
Another round of realm connections is coming! <br />
The pre-expansion patch will include content in Darkshore that tells the backstory of the Burning of Teldrassil. It will include both story quests and replayable skirmishes with elites. <br />
There will be 2.5D animated pieces that tells the story of the Burning of Teldrassil.<br />
The pre-expansion patch will be a few weeks before the expansion, similar to past expansions.<br />
<br />
<br />
Misc<br />
<br />
Warlords had the Garrison campaign, Legion had the Order Hall campaign, and Battle for Azeroth has a War Campaign.<br />
Attendees were shown the Zandalar landfall cinematic. Nathanos and a Zandalari troll are on a ship and mention that they believe that they have lost the Alliance that were chasing them after they rescued Princess Talanji. Talanji is in the cabin, praying to Rezan (https://wow.gamepedia.com/Rezan) for aid. She is worried that her father will not agree with her seeking out the aid of the Horde. He sees her boldness, power, enemies that fear both, and that her enemies that seek her demise are here. Alliance ships appear behind the Horde vessel and attack, with it sustaining some damage. Talanji summons a large dinosaur spirit and pushes her ship away quickly into fog. After exiting on the other side, you can see an entire fleet of Zandalari ships waiting. They fire and destroy the Alliance fleet. <br />
We are very close to a beta, which the team is trying to save for when the game is feature complete and polish is remaining. <br />
There are no planned changes to announce for Recruit a Friend.<br />
Patch 7.1 may have been released a little too soon, but other than that Legion content pacing worked out well.<br />
Trial of Valor was an idea that came up just before Legion launched.<br />
There are 6 factions for the continents, 3 for each continent. There are 2 neutral factions: Tortollan and Voice of Azeroth. <br />
<br />
<br />
World PvP<br />
<br />
The team isn't 100% sure why players are hesitant to engage in PvP combat. Is it the fact that there is a person on the other end, so they feel pressure and stress, or is it the behavior of the character on the other end. <br />
Leveling with War Mode (World PvP) enabled will grant more experience and rewards, with the intent being to offset the time lost to dealing with PvP and making leveling just as fast and rewarding with PvP on.<br />
You will fill up a bar with Conquest Points, earning a weapon or another piece of gear each time you fill it. Every week you earn another piece, and after you completed your set you will build a more powerful set.<br />
If you are a Gladiator level player, there is still a random loot system that rewards gear competitive with raid gear.<br />
Honor Talents are now tied to player level and will be unlocked as you level to 120.<br />
When you have War Mode on, you will be put on a shard with only other players that have it on. <br />
Group finder will only list groups with players that have the same War Mode toggle state as you. <br />
You can manually group with people that have War Mode off, but you won't be able to see them out in the world.<br />
<br />
<br />
Warfronts<br />
<br />
The expansion will release with a 20 player Warfront in Arathi Highlands. <br />
Warfronts may change the outside world when your faction controls it, granting access to quests or world bosses.<br />
Your faction will turn in resources, unlock the warfront, play through the content and win the battle, then hold it for around 5-7 days while the other faction turns in resources to fight to control it. <br />
Resources turned in include Azerite, gold, tradeskill materials, and more. <br />
You will almost always win a warfront battle, so there is no risk of one faction holding it for a long time. Warfronts are held by one faction across an entire region. <br />
More Warfronts will open as the expansion progresses. <br />
<br />
<br />
Island Expeditions<br />
<br />
You’ll queue for Normal, Heroic, Mythic, or PvP difficulties either alone or with a group by using an Expedition table in Zuldazar Harbor (Horde) or Boralus Harbor (Alliance). <br />
Island Expeditions are three-player encounters, and while you can play as any mix of roles, you’ll want to make sure you’re coordinating with the rest of your group to overcome the opposing faction and acquire 6,000 Azerite before they do.<br />
Island Expeditions use your party member's visibility to show Azerite on the map until the entire island's map is revealed. <br />
There are six different islands with dozens of enemies and structures. There are 6 enemy groups per faction. <br />

Battle for Azeroth Interview with WoW Developers<br />
Blizzardwatch (https://blizzardwatch.com/2018/04/05/wow-developer-qa-travis-day-jimmy-lo/) and our team sat down with Jimmy Lo (Senior Concept Artist) and Travis Day (Senior Producer) to ask some questions about Battle for Azeroth.<br />
<br />
<br />
Arathi is the only announced Warfront, but there are definitely more planned. The goal is to have a rotation of different locations by the time all the patches are out.<br />
The team likes to control specific class fantasy and so it will be on a case by case basis whether or not spec specific artifact weapon transmogs will be allowed by different specs.<br />
Thin humans are a different body type for the Kul Tiran humans. They are not a different race. The team wanted bigger and smaller models to fit the various NPC roles and add more flavor to the world. <br />
The way the opening of Battle for Azeroth plays out with the burning of Teldrassil, the team hopes that what happened is open for debate. It is likely that the belief will be that Sylvanas burned the tree, but how much of the Horde is behind that decision is open to debate, as well as how much of the retribution is Anduin proving his manhood.<br />
The art team is always looking at races to see what customizations can be added. With the focus on Allied Races, the team has wondered what options should be revisited on existing races and update as needed, such as with the Blood Elf golden eyes.<br />
The team is not 100% sure how the future Allied Races will be unlocked. They used the ones on live to see what motivates the players. Some races might be unlocked organically just by progressing in the Battle for Azeroth story. This might also affect where and what level the allied race starts at.<br />
Battle for Azeroth will have a War Campaign which is an ongoing chapter story similar to how Suramar played out. The campaign will begin during questing and continue at max level.<br />
The team is getting a little more open to different race/class combinations, such as the introduction of a Night Elf Paladin during the Legion story. There is nothing planned in the near future for new combinations.<br />
The team is interested in using the new AI in other aspects of the game, but they want to see how players react to it first. It is doubtful it will be used for all NPCs in the world, but possibly things like rare spawns.<br />
The new AI can do things like jump and line of sight you.<br />
In terms of storylines for zones, the team starts off with a premise and displays it through key art and imagery. After the aesthetic is set up, the team discusses where the story will go and what the story is trying to tell. The existential threats and story form the cohesive world and allows the team to set up how they want the players to traverse these locales.<br />
Every quest in the game has gone through about 24 different people before it makes it to live testing. Quests and side quests evolve as different team members test them.<br />
One of the primary characters in Kul Tiras comes from one of the artists. The character’s story was pitched and was well received and so was placed in the game.<br />
One of the quest designers is responsible for the creepy girl in Drustvar’s story. She worked mostly on Tiragarde Sound, but pitched an idea for the Drustvar story once she heard the background information on the zone.<br />
The goal for the Heart of Azeroth is to have traits on each tier that are applicable both generally and specifically to each spec of your class. This will likely make it so that you have different gear pieces for your head, shoulders and chest that you prefer for each of your specs. <br />
The team believes it’s a healthy part of gameplay to collect different sets based on different gameplay. This includes PvP and different specs. There will be traits that are useful for all different styles of game play such as increased crit chance on abilities, which is beneficial regardless of PvP or PvE. <br />
Questing gear will have smaller increases to abilities than max level gear and higher item level gear.<br />

&quot;This will likely make it so that you have different gear pieces for your head, shoulders and chest that you prefer for each of your specs.&quot;<br />

&quot;This will likely make it so that you have different gear pieces for your head, shoulders and chest that you prefer for each of your specs.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dont know why, maybe if the azerite pieces is hard to get. I just dont know :eek:<br />
<br />
I only dps so it doesn't bother me, and if I feel like tanking (monk, pally, or warrior) a random M+ or something, I'll just use the dps gear. Its not hard to keep an extra set around too though.</div></div><hr />

Are the developers that out of touch? In the years that I've played WoW (started ~2.1), I've only had one single world PvP encounter that was fun and balanced. A ret paladin and I beat on each other back and forth in Felwood back in WotLK. Every other encounter has been a gank of some sort: 10+ levels over or getting hammered when I'm already half dead or a 2 (or more) on 1 situation or a PvP geared/specced stealthed rogue stunlock kill.</div></div><hr />

Is it the fact that there is a person on the other end, so they feel pressure and stress, or is it the behavior of the character on the other end.<br />
<br />
It's pretty simple; players are more likely to engage in PvP when their victory is most certainly guaranteed, it's as simple as that. That's how it has always been, whether it's gear wise, level wise, or numbers wise. <br />
- Do you see someone of the opposite faction standing near you? Keep your eye on them. Have they just pulled 4 mobs? Time to hop in because you have the advantage. <br />
- Do you see someone who has half your health pool? An easy win; go over and fight them!<br />
- Are you a 110 cruising around a level 30 zone? Might as well kill that lowbie that stands no chance against being one shot.<br />
<br />
It's always been that way. There is no pressure, there is no stress, there is no worry about behavior of the other character, it's a simple question with a simple answer: &quot;Is my victory guaranteed?&quot; If yes, PvP happens. If no, PvP probably doesn't.</div></div><hr />

Very nice with it being 4 months out we are probably a month or two before we get the final silithus artifact weapon stuff and then whenever the prepatch comes out probably a month or more before the expansion so should be hardly any content draught at all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
How is it you don't have a single person on your development team that understands your PvP community? Is that why it's dying?<br />
<br />
People don't like to lose, it's that simple. That's it man.<br />
<br />
&quot;I could fight this guy, but I might lose... I'll leave him alone and hope for the same.&quot;<br />
<br />
And then if they attack you, you have an excuse for losing, &quot;I was leaving him alone! He jumped ME!&quot;<br />
<br />
This is why every random-BG match you see then entire team run on the opposite side of the map to get a flag in WSG. Or half the Horde goes Mines in AB because they might lose at LM (ensuring the people going to the Mill DO lose).<br />
<br />
You've stripped away so much of the flavor of PvP in order to make it palatable for everyone. Maybe go the other direction?<br />
<br />
<br />
You will fill up a bar with Conquest Points, earning a weapon or another piece of gear each time you fill it. Every week you earn another piece, and after you completed your set you will build a more powerful set.<br />
If you are a Gladiator level player, there is still a random loot system that rewards gear competitive with raid gear.<br />
<br />
Does &quot;earning&quot; mean I go to a vendor and pick the item I want? Or is it how the 1500 Honor item works currently? Because I'm genuinely concerned this means you're not understanding why your best expansion since Wrath is simultaneously considered the worst PvP system to date.<br />
<br />
<br />
When you have War Mode on, you will be put on a shard with only other players that have it on.<br />
Group finder will only list groups with players that have the same War Mode toggle state as you.<br />
You can manually group with people that have War Mode off, but you won't be able to see them out in the world.<br />
<br />
So what happens when 90% of your population has that toggled off? You're building a PvP system designed to actively encourage players to avoid the PvP system? As it stands now, when I join players on their PvE server for a Legion Invasion or Raid group, I'm forced to their server's rules. That's fine. But now I won't even see that group? So why would I ever toggle this mode on? I wouldn't even be able to help summon my friends on a PvE server because we can't see a summoning stone outside the instance? How is this an improvement?<br />
<br />
It's a voluntary Scarlet Letter that no one is going to turn on.<br />

I don't pvp because I am sick of looking at the same battlegrounds after 10 years. Why the fuck haven't they got at least a texture update? And why the fuck are ones like AV and IOC so unbalanced. They have had a decade to fix it. AV could be fucking amazing if they put any effort into updating it. <br />
<br />
Blizzard lack of effort with pvp is the reason I don't do it. Not because of other players. If blizzard doesn't give a shit. Why should i?</div></div><hr />

It will be pretty much level 10 levels &quot;our way&quot; by doing all the quests - if you don't, no flying for you. Then it will be &quot;do A B and C because we want you to, and if you don't - no flying for you&quot;. Some raids, some dungeons, and a new grind.<br />
<br />
Token price is going to go up, as a lot of people are like me and see it as not much and don't want to pay cash for that, so are dumping gold. I just brought my bnet balance up over $300 and have tokens sitting in my bag too. <br />
<br />
I really hope blizzard will prove me wrong, but I won't be playing bfa at the beginning I think unless I see something awesome. I am sitting here bored to death. I would rather wait a year in and do all the pathfinder shit, have flying and then have some fun with faster catchups on the grinds too. <br />
<br />
Blizz is predictable - a 1 trick pony. The game is the same shit in a different wrapper each xpac.</div></div><hr />

That's a pretty stupid try to argument. Blizzard said themselves they want to release expacs faster than back in the days. With the experience we have with the release of expacs they failed to do this. Forcing a release date just to say &quot;Look, we are faster than ever&quot; is incrediblely stupid. <br />
They don't even manage to bring the new races into the release. And that won't be the last thing they will have to delay.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard lack of effort with pvp is the reason I don't do it. Not because of other players. If blizzard doesn't give a shit. Why should i?<br />

Now this is a complaint I can agree with! They really need to redesign AV (for the 4th-5th time) and visually improve it and the other older ones. Throw in some new pvp transmog armor/mounts for completing some new/old pvp achievements.<br />

Do they not play the game or something? World PVP is almost always unfair; a strong character beating down a weak one. It's also not fun to be ganked in the middle of doing a quest. Rogues or cat Druids will stealth and wait for you to pull a bunch of mobs then easily destroy you while you're engaged with multiple enemies.</div></div><hr />

The team isn't 100% sure why players are hesitant to engage in PvP combat. Is it the fact that there is a person on the other end, so they feel pressure and stress, or is it the behavior of the character on the other end.<br />
<br />
Those that abhor open world pvp aside, I've found that myself and most of my guild mates haven't been engaging in World PvP because we play Alliance. Everywhere we go we are almost always outnumbered 10 to 1. It's all we can do to get through WQ's without getting ganked to hell and back. I doubt this warmode thing is going to address the staggering population differences between horde and alliance on pvp servers currently. If anything it's just going to exasperate it. Making it so I just won't ever turn it on unless I'm bored and looking to start a fight. <br />
<br />
As to why there are a gazillion horde vs alliance? It could be the fact that horde flat out has better racials on most of it's races than alliance. Or it could be that horde has more interesting story/writing. Or just that horde attracted the most competent gamers at one point, and now everyone just wants to play on the higher pop faction. Who knows.<br />
<br />
<br />
Warfronts<br />
You will almost always win a warfront battle, so there is no risk of one faction holding it for a long time. Warfronts are held by one faction across an entire region.<br />
<br />
I understand that in today's culture everyone must get a participation trophy and all that. And it would suck if your faction literally never won. But the other part of me wants to just say, what's the point?</div></div><hr />

Rofl, I loved outdoor PvP + since from Wotlk I have 1600 duels played with 1320 won. Issue is, that in legion my god damn warlock will die during Cloak of Shadow or AMS.. so for the fuck sake fix that, it is not about skill if I literally cant even touch the oponent because of horrible mechanisms, this is the reason why more and more players stop playing World PvP as some specific classes literally ruin that thing. It should be obvious.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is such a prime example of how much they do not know what they're doing with PvP. This is just simply shocking to read, how do you not understand your own game?<br />
<br />
First of all, most people can't be bothered with world PvP because they have too much other stuff that you have given them to do. Leveling now takes longer, and theres always a mountain of &quot;things to do&quot; for every player.<br />
<br />
Second, this connects with the first point made as there's no significant reward in killing anybody, only the risk of having to walk back to your corpse. I get, some honor? Great... zzz. PvP is now just in the way of the &quot;things to do&quot; that you actually need to do. Not to mention the walk back to your body can not always be an easy one. I've had some nightmare situations of trying to get back to my body in this game cause of poor spirit healer placement.<br />
<br />
Third, the skill cap that I used to rely on to win encounters has been reduced so much, along with burst in world pvp being absurd, that its so rare that a world pvp fight is anything more then one person getting globaled and griefed. World pvp success is measured by ilvl almost everytime. There's a reason why they put in the PvP templates, aren't they aware of why?<br />
<br />
Fourth, population imbalance that only gets worse. Horde outnumber Alliance in such massive numbers that it makes questing too frustrating and vulnerable. This is highlighted even more with the new allied races that came out. Leveling my Horde characters has been a breeze, I actually gave up on leveling my Alliance characters mostly til I can turn off PvP. (And this is coming from predominantly a PvP player). <br />
<br />
Need to actually balance your game if you actually expect players to participate in it.<br />
<br />
These dev's man, I swear. Everytime I just put these guys out of my mind and just accept the game is just mediocre and that's totally okay, they have to say something that gets me going all over again. The PvP game is just so damn awful and has been since MoP, and there's no way it'll get better anytime soon with any of these devs in charge. Shameful, clueless, vapid.</div></div><hr />

I was AFK on my lock this morning (nurse was with me as I'm currently having chemo)<br />
was being attacked and some alliance player sent me a series of messages in an utter rage I was just &quot;standing there&quot;.<br />
you name a swear word they used it. when I tried to reply the reasons I actually was AFK. they had ignored me.<br />
<br />
WPVP is nothing like a few years ago. I have so many toons on outland it simply isn't viable to move but with the balance issues<br />
just find that entire part of WOW at the moment toxic</div></div><hr />

<br />
I joined a friend on a pvp server, it was fun for a while, but the battles always become lopsided. When there is more of the opposing faction it becomes a slaughter, even if the combat is fun the more you die, the longer you have to wait to resurrect, a few death greets you with 2 minutes, a few more greets you with 5 minutes and when this starts happening everyone gets bored and leaves.<br />
<br />
It doesn't help that some classes have such long stuns, a dps burst that doesn't give you a shot at all, or you're just outnumbered.<br />
<br />
Couple these 2 with a corpse run from hell, and you have a recipe for failure.</div></div><hr />

It is good to add stuff little by little so when something breaks it is easier to pinpoint. They do not finish a piece of content, put it on alpha then start working on the next, that would be almost as stupid as assuming they would do that.<br />
<br />
It's not exactly that way, specially because for some stuff to work, it needs something prior to it also working.<br />
<br />
And when you throw things up for test and receive feedback, you'll need to be well prepared to receive that feedback and able to work on it (making any changes needed).<br />
<br />
Remember that with even more time, we ended up getting some really messed up stuff for Legion Launch that they had to go emergency mode to try to &quot;fix&quot; it applying some hotfix with band-aid stuff<br />
<br />
We're still on, as someone already said, shit fest that is alpha with only 4 months to release. It can mean two things: 1) it will be a rushed launch or 2) it's all for show and only to fix some major screw ups in the software, because things are set on stone for what they want and will ignore almost all the feedback.</div></div><hr />

Well then, hire me since I could tell them the exact reasons no one engages in PvP combat in the world.<br />
<br />
First of all, their balance sucks. 1v1 is rarely ever balanced. Add to it ilevels and legendaries and it becomes even more clear how someone would be hesitant purely because they don't know what the other ones packing. Second, they are typically busy doing other things and don't want to be arsed to stop. When you make it a chore to do any given daily, people don't want to stop to fight a potentially losing battle. Third, its not worth it. Remember timeless isle and the ordos coins? Tons of PvP happening then. It had some nice mount and pet. Random world PvP doesn't have any reward. Not even the honor gained can compete with what you would get in a bg. <br />
<br />
These are the major reasons. It's not some huge mystery. <br />
<br />
I am also a tad concerned with how quickly its moving into launch. Some of the changes that are slated are not changes I particularly like. There is still no information on how some of the artifact appearances are going to carry over (druid forms), or pvp prestige levels that you've earned.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This makes me quite nervous for the success of Warfronts. I've been really excited about what they can do with this feature, but making it easy to win just makes the defending team feel like there's no point to contribute to their war campaign. Playing as the attacking team will get boring fast if there's no skill required. I know you're fighting AI, so I'm referring to individual faction instances. This feature could be made much more competitive (even if vs AI) than how they make it sound.</div></div><hr />

I was reading a thread in these forums last night about how BfA could not possibly be ready by Sept. 18 (no way, they said). They claimed it was too unfinished and Blizzard was obviously months behind (at least). Posters were hoping Blizz would delay the release of BfA in order to not launch an &quot;unfinished, unpolished&quot; product.<br />
<br />
Next day: Blizz announces it will launch a month early! <br />

It might make sense lorewise, but it was one of the main selling point for me this time.<br />
What doesn't help is the fact that with it being released later, it goes completely against the concept of Heritage transmog that you only get while leveling from scratch.<br />
I was completely ok with finishing the main story available at launch, do some quests, farm some rep and switch to Zandalari before I start getting some decent gear and raids, but now... I don't think I'll be willing to start a new main character from scratch to get that sweet transmog if it's too long after release.</div></div><hr />

Hah, do you think that they can overhaul the alliance-zones in the little time they have now? Surely not. So yes, RIP alliance content. They need 4 months alone to get the bugs out and balance the classes. With the release of the date the beta is near, and they don't add lots of content in the beta-phase anymore.<br />

So yes, there will be a few new quests here and there, but the alliance needs an overhaul.</div></div><hr />

But as time went on I got my hyped for it and the more stuff they started to show the more it looked like it was going to be a solid expansion, just toned down in the &quot;threat&quot;. But with the VERY little info about Warfronts, and the introduction of Azerite gear being very underwhelming I am starting to think that BfA is in fact a &quot;filler&quot; expansion in the vain that WoD was a &quot;filler&quot; expansion while Blizzard put the real work into legion.<br />
<br />
Maybe this is there new development cycle....Release a &quot;Filler&quot; expansion(WoD) while the A-Team works on the next Major expansion(Legion). A-team is now working on the next Major expansion while we play the filler expansion(BfA), and the cycle repeats...<br />
<br />
Filler isn't necessarily bad, its just not going to be as good as a major expansion. In reality they should own up to this and charge less for the filler content, but that's sure never going to happen.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ohh look its Warhammer40k featuring Silithus Prequest. Let's guess how this will turnout for low population alliance/horde servers...<br />
<br />
<br />
Warfronts may change the outside world when your faction controls it, granting access to quests or world bosses.<br />
Your faction will turn in resources, unlock the warfront, play through the content and win the battle, then hold it for around 5-7 days while the other faction turns in resources to fight to control it.<br />
Resources turned in include Azerite, gold, tradeskill materials, and more.<br />
You will almost always win a warfront battle, so there is no risk of one faction holding it for a long time. Warfronts are held by one faction across an entire region.</div></div><hr />

Instead of rewarding players for hard work, we know get rewarded for a mindless grind which will be obsolete within a month. That is way too soon.</div></div><hr />

Maybe reading the myriad of feedback we've given you would help. Feedback like we don't want fucking RNG loot boxes anymore and we want to control our stat templates. But hey, just keep that crap around, who cares about feedback. We are just unsure why we don't engage in PvP.</div></div><hr />

I guess that makes sense since the faction has spent their time gathering resources and such, but that almost lessens the drive for me a bit. We'll see come execution. If the gameplay/rewards are compelling enough I won't mind, but right now it's a bit of a turn off.<br />

Syl's face was actually a cut away of a completely different cinematic / area. He is most likely talking to Genn, not Syl. He wouldn't get that close to Syl if she actually wanted war, she'd kill him.<br />

What? No one is forcing you to race change. Want to play an allied race and don't want to pay? Then level it up. What you said makes zero sense. And no one is forcing you to faction change, I have zero feeling on wanting to faction change and I've been alliance since beta. You're just coming up with issues that are not there for the sake of bitching.</div></div><hr />

The team isn't 100% sure why players are hesitant to engage in PvP combat.

Then you weren't paying attention. They explicitly said one of the reasons WoD was so poor was it was only designed to last 1-1.5 years and they realized that they just cannot meet that release schedule. They were very up front that the 1-1.5 year expansion time was no longer a goal they were shooting for.</div></div><hr />

Why are players fearful of entering PVP combat?<br />
Because they don't like to lose, and thus they'll only engage in ganking where they're sure to win. <br />
<br />
<br />
My approach is to let the person kill me over and over and see who gets tired first. I stand there while they merrily chop away. It's fantastically stupid.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Leveling with War Mode (World PvP) enabled will grant more experience and rewards, with the intent being to offset the time lost to dealing with PvP and making leveling just as fast and rewarding with PvP on.<br />
<br />
Yeah, if you want to level faster and get rewards more often you're pretty much better off turning PVP on. I feel forced and I hate PVP.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just as fast&quot; is not accurate in this case. Say I'm questing in pvp mode and i get into world pvp, i'll get more xp than someone who decides to not turn on pvp.<br />

I'd be careful, we don't k it what the unlock requirments for zandalari are gonna be yet. Would be naff to come back and find you need exalted zandalari or something</div></div><hr />

So people should just throw 60 euros/dollars at Blizzard just in case?</div></div><hr />

&gt;Blizzard is known for being dogshit with pvp balance<br />
<br />
Oh boy.<br />
<br />
It's not heavily PvP focused. Warfronts aren't PvP if that's what you're thinking.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Do what they want. Just be warned it's likely they will have an unlock requirment and if ur paying the 60 dollars any way when there released and need to do that grind. Better to it at release then wait than try and do it a few months in and not have zandalari as soon as there out.</div></div><hr />

Is a shit release date right in the middle of the summer!<br />
<br />
its a bit stupid date since most of people in civilised countries are on vacation then or enjoying summer. <br />
<br />
feels rushed for unknown reasons even if its meant to boost q3 $$$$ numbers.</div></div><hr />

But I guess it is not so bad, since raids will be open probably weeks later...</div></div><hr />

Legit only reason I'm getting it is for the &quot;unobtainables&quot; I have 0 idea of what is coming in BFA.<br />
...<br />
Exactly. Just give me my in game items and I am done. The positive about that is you also get rewards for other games like HotS, HS or SC.<br />
<br />
WoW simply died for me after MoP.</div></div><hr />

Not sure I want to pay a sub to grind and wait rather than pay a sub to just do the grind and play the race I actually want to play.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
Eh, it's just 3 slots, like I said, I use different pieces for each those slots on my main anyway, so it essentially makes no difference, so long as it isn't(and I don't believe it is) like the Netherlight Crucible, i'm fine.<br />
<br />
Also, is that CoF, Convergence of Fates by any chance? :P I feel ya buddy, did elisande twice a week pretty much the entirety of NH and it never dropped once on her corpse and never got it from Bonus rolls.</div></div><hr />

Just hope they dont require a 120 toon, that would be lame if you want to main a zandalari on bfa .x</div></div><hr />

<br />
#1 reason: You stomp the person into the ground 1v1, they get butthurt, and get 3 of their friends to follow you around and camp you for the rest of the night, and all you wanted to do was your dailies. lol.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Totally.<br />
If they need proof just make a toon on outland EU. Horde side and just see why players avoid it.<br />
even with Cross Realm there are times Dailies can take best part of 5 hours. when you have quite a few alts also<br />
it becomes a nightmare trying to complete them.<br />
<br />
On the release date. Lets be honest WOW is never going to reach the heights it did before, Loads of us have already pre ordered<br />
Its just a Question now of getting the Expansion out there for us to play.</div></div><hr />
