It is but I can understand it. To unlock the allied races you need to do their emissary stuff and without some max level character to do that the whole emissary stuff makes little sense.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wait a minute. So if I, as Alliance, have no Horde characters but I am exalted with Nightfallen on my Alliance character, I can't start a Nightborne asap because I still need a high level Horde character to do some gimmick scenario at 110 in order to unlock them for the account?!<br />

exactly...and this is a GOOD THING because it confirms they are not going to be total @#$@# and still allow us to use RAF for Allied Races - this just means I'm going to have a few extra level 90's I didn't need or want, that's ok though, lol.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not just current. You just have to have a 110. So any realm you have that on you can make an allied race. Plenty of people have 110's on a server that it is not current i'm sure.</div></div><hr />

Getting from Artifact level 75 to 101 (current cap) takes 917 times as much AP as does getting from level 1 to 75. Adding 50 more levels to that is just insanity :E</div></div><hr />

They never said you need exalted with Army of Light, that would be incredibly stupid as it would take a month+ or so of every day grind to get exalted with AoL, making unlocking them completely retarded in BFA when everyone has moved on from Legion. While at the same time, you can get exalted with Nightfallen in several days just from doing their quest chain and the order hall missions time gate.</div></div><hr />

They pretty much have to, cause otherwise it's just impossible.<br />
<br />
Trait 101 (Concordance 50) takes 200.000.000.000.000 AP, that's 50.000 Big WQ 4B tokens for 1 trait. And that's not concordance 51+<br />

Well, we don't know the exact requirements for Allied races, some rumors are out that some require rep, now if it's exalted or less is not known. Probably less for Argus races, as like I said , Nathrezim tome of +200% rep doesn't work for Argus. But it makes Nightfallen/Highmountain like only need 10 x 1500 tokens from Neutral (from order hall missions)</div></div><hr />

This... has got to be a placeholder or something. It kinda makes sense to have SOME level requirement since they start at lvl 20 and I'm sure they don't want people to just flood servers with allied races because they cut a little time off the leveling. I'd say require something like lvl 30 on the server or something in that range. If you REALLY want to play that allied race you can still grind it out but you have more incentive to play the character you already invested time into leveling.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would go so far as saying level 20 as that's where the allied races start. 110 seems needlessly excessive as a restriction as you already need to have unlocked them which requires a high level character on whatever server. Adding a requirement for 110 on the realm you create on seems overkill.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A cynicist could say that this is ActiBlizz's ploy to sell realm transfers/character boosts (which is to 110 in Legion) when people want to roll new Allied characters.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't have 110 on the realm you want to play in? You can always transfer one for $25 or boost a dummy for $60!&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah but you literally can't get to that cap with current AK, so it makes little to no difference in terms of the longevity of AP.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Also, please Blizz, don't make us need a 110 on every realm we want to roll an allied race on. It makes no sense. I want to grind out the heritage sets with my friends. We all play on different servers and we'd like to roll these characters on the same server.<br />
<br />
I don't even mind that it seems we'll need a 110 on both factions to unlock all 6. Just don't lock anything to realms.</div></div><hr />

Got to keep those subscriptions up during the content drought between now and BfA release somehow. We'll probably be lucky if they don't block heirloom armor and weapons from being used on allied races or remove the XP boost from heirlooms.

3-5 ranks would have sufficed. Just one would have given them a few extra years. 50 gives them more time than the entirety of human history down to when we were still hanging from the trees without extra AK.</div></div><hr />

We knew, from day One, that Blizzard would be locking Allied Races behind NEEDING a 110 on a specific realm to create them.. Even AFTER you've already ran through the Quest on your Main 110's. How does this make ANY sense at all? This means you won't ever get to start on a fresh realm with the Race you want if it's an Allied Race. Seems kinda REALLY idiotic to add yet more gating to a major selling point of an expansion, but.. It's Blizzard.

Level 50 concordance is what, Artifact level 104? With the way AP scales, no one can hope to get anywhere close before the end of expansion. So it means we're getting more AK sometime...</div></div><hr />

How the heck could you think otherwise? What sense would it make for your exalted alliance character to recruit the Nightborne for the horde? <br />
<br />
Do the work and to earn your reward, it's an RPG for god's sake.<br />
<br />
Personally I just want the exalted rep to be account wide, I can do the quest on my horde alts, but I've only maxed out nightfallen on a single character, and that one is alliance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;Don't have 110 on the realm you want to play in? You can always transfer one for $25 or boost a dummy for $60!&quot;<br />
<br />
You know, that's probably what it is ._. all my characters are on the same server consisting of all horde and 1 worgen rogue cos I thought it suited best. After reading all this and getting upset my mind did flick briefly to &quot;Well I could always transfer my rogue over somewhere&quot;. You can't trick me Blizz!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Getting from Artifact level 75 to 101 (current cap) takes 917 times as much AP as does getting from level 1 to 75. Adding 50 more levels to that is just insanity :E<br />
<br />
Why would you need them anyway? End of the expansion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Makes me wonder why does Blizzard add them? Even the current cap is pure in sanity with current AK level, why do we need more levels?</div></div><hr />

Gotta get that playtime in before allowing players access to the things they want, despite them paying dearly for it in the first place. SMH. If they think this is a way to retain player interest, it is splitting their player-base instead with these arbitrary time-sinks to be allowed to get on the ride you want.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Given the leveling changes, and the PvP server changes prompting rerolls (like me), this smells of pushing boosts and transfers.<br />
<br />
No deal, Blizz. Keep your timesink races.</div></div><hr />

Agreed. /10char</div></div><hr />
