Patch 8.2.5 - More War Campaign Conclusion Cutscenes<br />
The Battle for Azeroth War Campaign conclusion had two other in-game cutscenes (https://www.mmo-champion.com/content/8752-The-War-Campaign-Finale-Cinematics) that take place after the two main ones covered the other day. The first one below is the final scene for Alliance characters and Saurfang supporters. The second one is the scene you see if you remained a Sylvanas loyalist. Thanks to the Youtube Supreme IRM (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvSSvH63TCzCYGJeveVOKnQ) for the scenes! SPOILERS AHEAD!<br />

I may be mistaken, but I think the Fourth War may be intended to represent the entire period of Horde/Alliance hostility in World of Warcraft. This war is specifically called The Blood War.</div></div><hr />

He didn't. The &quot;Spirits&quot; told him that she'd be fit to be Warchief. It's rumored the Spirits was just whatever Sylvanas is being controlled by.</div></div><hr />

This whole story arc seems so artificial and forced. The writers realized you can't keep writing in bigger baddies so they just make heroes turn into villains and chase one another.<br />
<br />
Why not just make an expansion about what WoW was always about? Slaying dragons, finding treasures in ancient civilizations and helping locals? I guess that would be too hard to advertise.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeaaaaahhhh, kind of. It is whatever Blizzard wants it to be, and the entire game is structured around the faction &quot;war&quot; but there was no outright battles taking place in vanilla, TBC, or wrath. It was more sniping at each other and small blowups. Outright WAR started in Cata, and peaked in Pandaria. WOD kind of reset the war. Legion was a &quot;war&quot; vs. the Legion, like the 3rd war, and ended at the end of Legion, and should, by Blizzard's usage in the past, be the 4th war, but for some reason Afriasiabi and the writing team have decided that this is the end of a &quot;war&quot; that has no real defined beginning. The events of BfA should be the 5th war, by my reckoning, but I don't make the game up, they do. <br />
<br />
It is whatever they decide it is, I guess. And they'll retcon if/as needed to make it work.</div></div><hr />

Though to be fair, it might not have been a trick per se - depending on what comes next, she might very well have been the Warchief the Horde needed at the time. An alternative candidate might have done things differently and led things to disaster. Sometimes what seems terrible in the short term turns out the best option in the long term.<br />
<br />
We just don't know yet. But it would seem a little too simplistic - even for Blizzard - to just have Vol'jin be duped by Bwonsamdi's big momma or whatever. Then again... they have been bungling the story pretty hard lately...</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's more of a game/franchise thing, according to the lore : <br />
<br />
The First War (https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/First_War) is Warcraft (Orcs &amp; Humans), and the Second War (https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Second_War) is Warcraft II.<br />
The Third War (https://wow.gamepedia.com/Third_War) is basically from the invasion of Lordaeron by Arthas to the fall of Archimonde at Hyjal, which would make it roughly Warcraft 3 + vanilla + BC.</div></div><hr />

The person leading the Forsaken after Sylvanas is likely to be Calia Menethil. The novel supports this, and so does the shiny, new Undead model for her.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Unless Odyn is going to give her use of the Val’kyr, then Syl will somehow still lead them. As it is, Syl’s Val’kyr are the only way for The Forsaken to continue getting more of a population. <br />
If Syl is gone completely, with her Val’kyr, then the Forsaken are a dying race.</div></div><hr />

It was silly before, it's silly now and WoW is one of the few MMOs that still cling to the outdated faction concept. The &quot;war&quot; has been over since Warcraft 2 if you pay attention to any of the lore; I mean hell the entire point of Warcraft 3 (and WoW, and every expansion since) was that every time the Horde and Alliance fight each other, all it does is strengthen their enemies and weaken them, and they have to join forces at the end anyways.<br />
<br />
It's time for it to go. They can very easily eliminate factions for PVE and keep them for PVP purposes; lots of other games have done that without preventing people from playing with their friends because someone really like Orcs and someone really wants to play a Dwarf or whatever.</div></div><hr />

He flat out tells us that he didn't want her to be Warchief because Sylvanas is killing too much and keeps what she kills as undead. He's all for war and death but she's tipping the balance too far for his liking. The Lich King and Eyir both tell Vol'jin that he's been touched by something far more sinister than either of them are capable of doing, and if I had to guess, Bwonsamdi too. Though I wouldn't put it passed Blizzard to be all &quot;Oops, they all lied&quot; at this point. I just have a feeling whatever it was that pushed for Sylvanas' naming of Warchief is who she serves, not someone we know by name in the current lore.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's not exactly clear. It could be WoW's Death version of the Void Lords and Titans or if it could be it's related to the Devouring Darkness (https://www.wowhead.com/npc=100495/devouring-darkness#abilities) that the Kobolds fear and could be the boss of that creature.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
So Alliance ambush in Stormheim, attempted assassination and spies attacking Horde Civilians in Silithus isn't Casus Belli? Or what about mobilising a Night Elf army against Silithus? You mean Jaina who took a time out in the shadow realm to mope about herself and flip flop over whether she thinks her father was justified or evil?</div></div><hr />

You're the kind of person that was probably shocked when Sylvanas left the Horde.</div></div><hr />

It could be WoW's Death version of the Void Lords and Titans or if it could be it's related to the Devouring Darkness (https://www.wowhead.com/npc=100495/devouring-darkness#abilities) that the Kobolds fear and could be the boss of that creature.<br />

So Alliance ambush in Stormheim, attempted assassination and spies attacking Horde Civilians in Silithus isn't Casus Belli? Or what about mobilising a Night Elf army against Silithus? You mean Jaina who took a time out in the shadow realm to mope about herself and flip flop over whether she thinks her father was justified or evil?<br />
<br />
Stop with that BS...if you want to go back in time it's the Orcs fault for drinking the blood and invading Azeroth. No matter how hard you try it's the Horde who started it. She was up to sneaky shit and Genn was right, you just keep pointing this out because you're pissed Genn was 100% right.</div></div><hr />

Back in time? It was the events of the last expansion directly preceding the war. Not around 30 years ago. Though if we were referencing the past we could go even further back and blame the Draenei for leading the Legion to the Orcs in the first place or the Eredar for taking Sargeras' deal or heck the Titans for taking on a role in the galaxy at large. I'm not pissed at what Genn did, what I am pissed about is that the Alliance story keeps getting retconned to put them into a peace broker/reactionary stance all the time instead of taking on and admitting the things that they did resulted in consequences. I would like it if there was only so many times that Anduin could pull the excuse &quot;my subordinates screwed up&quot;/&quot;it was a mistake&quot; and that he would instead own up to some of the more shady/confrontational stuff he's ordered more but we all know Blizzard will keep pulling excuses to ensure he stays as the personification of Moral Good that they want him to be.</div></div><hr />

You're pissed that Genn attacked Sylvanas and cost her immortality...you're pissed she was doing shady things and left breadcrumbs that lead right to her. You just can't get over it was really fucking shady what she was doing up there...and you know it.</div></div><hr />

Technically, if you want to go back to it all, it was the Trolls who discovered the Well who then evolved into the Elf races who then practiced the Arcane Magic’s that drew the attention of the Legion in the first place.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cparle87</div><div class="date">2019-09-29, 02:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeaaaaahhhh, kind of. It is whatever Blizzard wants it to be, and the entire game is structured around the faction &quot;war&quot; but there was no outright battles taking place in vanilla, TBC, or wrath. It was more sniping at each other and small blowups. Outright WAR started in Cata, and peaked in Pandaria. WOD kind of reset the war. Legion was a &quot;war&quot; vs. the Legion, like the 3rd war, and ended at the end of Legion, and should, by Blizzard's usage in the past, be the 4th war, but for some reason Afriasiabi and the writing team have decided that this is the end of a &quot;war&quot; that has no real defined beginning. The events of BfA should be the 5th war, by my reckoning, but I don't make the game up, they do. <br />
<br />
It is whatever they decide it is, I guess. And they'll retcon if/as needed to make it work.<br />
<br />
Wars can have many different settings and take years. To date in Warcraft the only war that was contained to one region was the First War, and it raged for like a decade. The Second War took place across the entirety of the Eastern Kingdoms, the seas around thereof, and Draenor. The Third War was in Lordaeron, Quel'thalas, much of Kalimdor, and Northrend. The WoW intro cinematic said that the peace from the Third War has all but evaporated. And like others I believe the Fourth War ended at the Battle for Undercity and has lasted until now. Garrosh and Varian, Sylvanas and Genn, Sylvanas and Nathanos. There were hostiles on both sides who just kept starting new shit whenever things looked like they were mellowing out, so there was never a time in that entire period that some part of their factions weren't duking it out. Until now, I believe. We have the entire Horde and Alliance, save Tyrande, being willing to call it quits.</div></div><hr />

What? I'm in no way pissed that Genn beat Sylvanas as I already mentioned. I don't really care about the outcome of Stormheim faction questline as it ends up going nowhere (apart from the fact Genn just needed a little nap after getting shot by a poisoned arrow maybe) and I have more issues with how the writers keep changing stuff to put the factions in certain lights. I don't disagree she was doing shady stuff in Stormheim but it still doesn't change the fact that the Alliance attacked first.</div></div><hr />

Rly Thrall, you alrdy shamed yourself of cheating against Garrosh but to now even not recognise Garrosh his deeds anymore is shamefull.<br />
You even got hellscreams blessing in ICC because he is the commander Saurfang is just there to reclaim his sons body.</div></div><hr />

<br />
ACTUALLY, go back far enough, its all the Draeneis fault that the Legion came to Draenor, the Legion then deceived the Orcs (as mentioned in post before this)But the original idiots of Azeroth were the Nightelves. They were the ones that drew the Legions attention to Azeroth, which is really what the Legion was after when they got the Orcs to invade thru the Dark Portal using....Medivh! a human.<br />

i tried to teach them, i tried to get them to abandon hope.<br />
<br />
yeah then those ones you had executed and killed after Wrathgate. [as you could no longer control them]<br />
<br />
no wonder, none of the forsaken went that route afterwards<br />
<br />
who wrote this? WoW has became, not only cliche and filled with tropes (which we're used too) but just really bad writing.</div></div><hr />

Sylvanas was always about controlling everything.The few forsaken that she couldn't control anymore,she killed.<br />
Don't try to paint as a compassionate leader,she is a control freak with major anger management issues,and she always was that since her first death</div></div><hr />

In my experience, the two are practically synonymous. No one is trying to paint Sylvanas as compassionate, however.</div></div><hr />

As it is, Syl’s Val’kyr are the only way for The Forsaken to continue getting more of a population. <br />
If Syl is gone completely, with her Val’kyr, then the Forsaken are a dying race.<br />
<br />
Not necessarily. In the novel, Anduin was able to resurrect Calia Menethil as a Forsaken using the Light. There weren't any val'kyrs involved in it.</div></div><hr />
