<meta name="description" content="Patch 4.2 - PTR Build 14313 
Another bugfix build has been deployed on test realms tonight. That one really didn't have any interesting changes and it looks like the June 28th release date shouldn't be reported, I'll assume Blizzard is done at this point. 
 
 
End of Season 9 Postponed for 1 Week 
The patch won't hit the live servers next week and as predicted, it means the Arena Season will end later than expected. 
As an update, Season 9 will be ending no earlier than June 28.

[...] Unfortunately, there are many logistical reasons for why we needed to push back the end date to the 28th. Keep in mind our original announcement said it could end &quot;as early as June 21.&quot; It wasn't an absolute confirmation of the end date. The announcement now says it could end &quot;as early as June 28&quot;, which means it's still not guaranteed to end that day. It just depends on if all of our other ducks are in a row.<br />

Tier 12 Armor Sets models on actual T12 set items have been available on test realms for a few days and we finally know what will be the color of every version of Tier 12 Armors!

<br />
because they know a lot of people have already quit due to lack of new content. its like when you kick yourself because messed up at work and you say &quot;I'm going to make sure that doesn't happen again&quot;<br />
<br />
in response to people cancelling subscriptions, they said they will try to release content sooner. and they said this after they delayed firelands from 4.1 to 4.2 but still its taking even longer. so maybe it'll be out on the 28th, and maybe not, now they're keeping the door open still.<br />
<br />
the thing is, though they may have convinced you somewhere along the way that &quot;its blizzard's game, we pay to rent time&quot; they know its really the player's game. They know players have to stay satisfied, regardless if you think they dont. the customer always has the power. the business selling a product or service is for the customer, serving the customer. the customer has the power and will speak with their money. the business has to respect this or they won't be a business anymore. regardless of what you think about fairness or whatnot, that is reality.</div></div><hr />

It would be a great thing, if they change the colors from the tier sets in dependence with the spec.

I really like the color schemes on the both versions of the Rogue tier. It -almost- makes me want to play my Rogue.<br />
<br />
The Paladin tier looks almost identical from normal to heroic though; that is disappointing. Still looks cool though.<br />
<br />
Personally, the white version was a lot more badass.<br />

<br />
Learn your math. The loss was a hell of a lot more than .02%. The 600k is a 5% loss in subscriber base AND thats assuming that initial loss is the only loss they've had in customer base. I look around the realm I look around my guild and I see a lot more active player loss than that. Maybe they havent unsubscribed yet, but I've seen 2 entire 25 man guilds gutted down to 2 players where the rest of them just quit playing and moved onto other games. No they didnt jump guilds, their toons are still there. No they didnt go to alts. Pretty much all of them have said they're done with caty and may be back next xpac. I dont think thats an abnormal number and that my realm or experience is &quot;unique&quot;. You can be a frog standing in a pot of water as it boils on the stove and not feel the heat rising about you or you can take off the myopic blinders and see what is really happening.</div></div><hr />

First with his comments about the guards in Tol Barad now this. Then again, Blizzard has sort of dropped the ball on pvp entirely. Arenas buggy, imbalanced and season going for too long, exploiting rampant, poor rewards. Regular BGs, bot ridden grinds that everyone hates. Rated BGs, hardly anyone does them, nerfed rewards. World PvP, stuffed due to guards. Apparently the population of PvP servers has taken a big hit with Cataclysm, we're seeing a lot of the low pop realms being PvP servers, and its not really hard to see why.</div></div><hr />

The loss was a hell of a lot more than .02%. The 600k is a 5% loss in subscriber base AND thats assuming that initial loss is the only loss they've had in customer base. I look around the realm I look around my guild and I see a lot more active player loss than that. Maybe they havent unsubscribed yet, but I've seen 2 entire 25 man guilds gutted down to 2 players where the rest of them just quit playing and moved onto other games. No they didnt jump guilds, their toons are still there. No they didnt go to alts. Pretty much all of them have said they're done with caty and may be back next xpac. I dont think thats an abnormal number and that my realm or experience is &quot;unique&quot;. You can be a frog standing in a pot of water as it boils on the stove and not feel the heat rising about you or you can take off the myopic blinders and see what is really happening.<br />
<br />
Especially since the 600k loss is on March 1st, and 3 more months are passed without new raids.</div></div><hr />

If that's still the case... with the new ptr build last night and the fact the end of the season is on June 28th now... I would say that 4.2 would be released on July 5th. I stated 2 months ago that I predicted the patch would go live on/around July 4th. It's just a perfect marketing window. I could be wrong.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">k1037</div><div class="date">2011-06-19, 04:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Do you really think that the &quot;loss&quot; of 0.02% of the player base is making Blizzard worried? Hell no, the monthly fluctuations are nothing more than that<br />
<br />
First, 600,000 is not 0.02%. That would mean that WoW has 300 million subscribers.<br />
<br />
Second, it's not just monthly fluctuation. The CEO of Blizzard himself said that that was the largest drop off in subscribers in the shortest period of time in WoW's history. And it didn't even reflect people who had already canceled their auto-renew but still had game time remaining. If 600k showed up within just 3 months, the actual number was much higher.<br />
<br />
Finally, 600k subscribers lost per quarter = 2.4 million subscribers lost by the end of the year. If GW2, D3, SW, summer, and the long breaks between content add to that, you could easily have 3 million subscribers lost by 2012. That's one out of every four players. And being a social game, WoW didn't gain subscribers through advertising or game reviews - people joined because of their friends. Loss of subscribers works the same way - any time a chunk of players leave, there is a serious risk that they will each take several friends with them.</div></div><hr />

There once was a time it was off the front page in less than 5 minutes without a bump.<br />

That depends on the size of the team. The developers of Assassins Creed can crank out an entire game every year, but they have a team of over 200 people. With wow being on the decline, I'm sure the team has gotten smaller.</div></div><hr />

Soooo you would rather them release a buggy product than a polished, working one? Damn you Blizzard for wanting to release a patch with as little problems as possible.</div></div><hr />

You really said this with a straight face? =)<br />
<br />
Well, see you Thursday, when the servers MAY be working, ignoring the disconnects and instances servers that are bound to be down. Or preferably a week later, when they're done with all the hotfixes (hotnerfs and buffs).<br />
<br />
I don't mind the issues, I just mind Blizzard pretending that they want 'perfect' when in fact they're never near 'mediocre' when releasing new content, especially on the technical side.<br />
<br />
<br />
I am not of the hardcore Arena crew so I have no idea in what ways this affects Arena players, but I am sure it does. I also don't understand what's so hard about finishing seasons before the new patch goes live if there's so many issues? I think Blizzard has a lot more serious logistic problems if they fail to plan out a patchy like this in the 6 months they had flawlessly.</div></div><hr />

Reading between the words and judging from what he has said before he probably meant: &quot;...it looks like the June 28th release date shouldn't be delayed, I'll assume Blizzard is done at this point.&quot;<br />
<br />
Think it's more of a typo and even then I think most people grasped his meaning anyways.</div></div><hr />

Pretending they want perfect? So now people complain they are trying to patch with zero bugs?<br />
<br />
They know they can't do a perfect bug-free launch, but they'll do a better job patching a game with over ten million players than anyone else would. Never near mediocre? What are you even comparing that to? Another game as large as WoW with as much content as WoW? Oh, right...</div></div><hr />
