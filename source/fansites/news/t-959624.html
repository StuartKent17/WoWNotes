Patch 4.3 Interviews - Updated<br />
Interviews keep hitting the web and we now know a few more things thanks to the interviews on Kotaku (http://kotaku.com/5831732/cataclysm-comes-full-circle-deathwing-is-going-down), Gamona.de (http://wow.gamona.de/2011/08/17/wow-patch-4-3-ein-raid-drei-instanzen-und-ein-wirklich-lang-gehegter-traum/), and Buffed.de (http://www.buffed.de/World-of-Warcraft-PC-16678/News/WoW-Patch-43-Letzter-Raid-Patch-vor-naechster-Erweiterung-Kampf-gegen-Todesschwinge-spielt-teils-auf-dem-Ruecken-des-Drachen-Transmogrifier-Details-839781/)!<br />
<br />
New Raid<br />
<br />
Deathwing raid will be the final raid of the expansion.<br />
You will even get to ride on Deathwing's back during the fight, apparently to take him down over multiple phases.<br />
The project for an Abyssal Maw is gone for the moment, the storyline wasn't convincing enough/fitting.<br />
<br />
<br />
5-Man Instances<br />
<br />
3 new 5-man instances will be added in this patch.<br />
One of the instance will be in the Caverns of Time, for the War of the Ancients<br />
<br />
<br />
Transmogrifier (Preview below)<br />
<br />
The Transmogrifier NPC, which will let you change the appearance of any armor piece on you, while retaining the stats of your current gear. (= T12 stats, but with the Tier 2 look!) <br />
Players won't be able to change the appearance of their armor into another armor type or class armor set, and you might have to own the armor before you can use it to swap the appearance of your existing armor. <br />
<br />
<br />
Void Storage<br />
<br />
The Void Storage is a new type of bank where players will be able to store their old armors in order to free up space in their regular bank. <br />
It will hold 100-150 items. Anything stored there will lose all gems and enchantments. <br />
<br />
<br />
Raid Finder<br />
<br />
The Raid Finder will be introduced in Patch 4.3, it will work like the Dungeon Finder.<br />
<br />
<br />
Darkmoon Faire<br />
<br />
There will be a new Darkmoon Faire island with a bunch of new activities such as &quot;Whack-a-Gnome&quot; &quot;Whack-a-Gnoll&quot; (Sorry gnomes!)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Patch 4.3 Preview - Transmogrification<br />
You’ve been asking for it, and we were listening. In patch 4.3 you’ll be able to customize the appearance of your weapons and armor like never before.<br />
<br />
The Ethereals, emerging from the nether, will bring with them a new technology they call Transmogrification. They’re heading to the capital cities of Azeroth to set up shop and to offer adventurers a unique service -- copying the appearance of one magical item onto another. They only ask for a modest gold donation to recoup their costs.<br />
<br />
Visiting a Transmogrifier will present players with a new interface that will allow them to change the appearance of an item while retaining its original stats. This means that you can raid in your paladin tier 12 Immolation set, but look like you’re wearing Lightbringer, while priests can bring Benediction back -- at least in spirit. Hunters can once again roam the jungles of Stranglethorn Vale in their tier 2 Dragonstalker set. You could even slip into the saucy tailored Black Mageweave set for that matter. You know, with the thigh highs, and the little gloves, and the cute little… ahem.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2011/august/transmo1_small.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2011/august/transmo1.jpg)<br />
<br />
Placing an item into the Transmogrifier interface will offer a preview of how the item will appear once the change is applied. However, not all item pairings are compatible with Transmogrification. In general, only items that have stats can be used in the transmogrification process. You must also be able to wear both items when using this service. Ethereals don’t have much in the way of ethics, but allowing someone to appear as if they’re equipping unusable items crosses the line. Similarly, they won’t allow you to change weapon or armor types. Sneaky death knights can’t make that breastplate look like a cloth robe, and you can’t make a one-handed axe look like a two-handed axe, or transform a sword’s appearance into that of a mace. Guns, bows, and crossbows will be the exception to this rule. You will finally be able to retain your dwarf’s racial gun bonus while appearing with all the splendor and elegance of a bow wielder (or at least the relative silence of one).<br />
<br />
<br />
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2011/august/transmo2_small.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2011/august/transmo2.jpg)<br />
<br />
Placing items into the Transmogrify interface will increase the gold cost of the process, and clicking the Transmogrify button (assuming you have the necessary funds) will put the appearance change into effect. The process can be reversed by clicking the undo icon on each item, and then hitting the Transmogrify button once more to save the changes. Any item that’s transmogrified will have text indicating it’s been altered by the process for all to see, similar to the item tooltip callout for reforged items.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2011/august/transmo3_small.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2011/august/transmo3.jpg)<br />
<br />
Transmogrification encourages players to hold onto items with sentimental or aesthetic value, and the Ethereals anticipate that personal bag and bank space will be at a premium now that everyone will be hoarding their frilly pantaloons and leather jerkins. In anticipation of this new demand for additional storage space, they’ll be introducing a unique Void Storage service. What’s Void Storage, you ask? We’ll provide more details soon.<br />
<br />

<br />
We’re looking forward to seeing how players choose to customize their character’s appearance, and hope you’re as excited as we are for the arrival of patch 4.3 and the Transmogrification feature. Do you have a favorite set or weapon that you’ll be bringing back? Let us know in the comments below.</div></div><hr />

New raid and 3 new 5 mans. We seem to be at least 6-8 months off this patch and wth are ppl supposed to do in the meantime ? Really think they stay subbed for that long ? Guess BLizzard will be adding new mount and pets in their store to make up for the loss of subs.</div></div><hr />

That's very probably exactly what it means. I was hoping for an interface popup where you can select the tier pieces you want to show off, but you need to have the items yourself.</div></div><hr />

We do need to own the item i believe, but what i wanna know is... Will the item be deleted after? Does it mean i need to farm my bloodfang on rogue agian just to change the looks? i dont want it to be deleted it forever :/</div></div><hr />

<br />
The item is a totally different model after it's changed so it's not a 'dye'. A dye is changing the colour of a model. This system changes the model. And it's not a paid for service. The preview says it will just cost some gold.</div></div><hr />

It will just copy the item. Otherwise the very few people that have rare weapons and gear (T3, Corrupted Ashbringer, etc) would be very.. very.. very angry.</div></div><hr />

A dye is changing the colour of a model. This system changes the model. And it's not a paid for service. The preview says it will just cost some gold.<br />
<br />
My point was it should be a dye system rather then see ppl run in old tiers junk all over the place. Then make the new tiers so that they look awsome with diffrent colours - instead of putting 3 diffrent colours on exactly the same set for each spec...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because you care a whole lot about enchants on your old MC, BWL or even ICC gear?<br />
Its a practical problem, removing enchants and gems allows em to just 'store' an item id, having to save your own special version requires more data.<br />
And while for you thats not a whole lot every player in the world being able to store 150 enchanted and gemmed gear pieces is ALOT of data.<br />
<br />
Its just a stashhouse for old gear anyway, nothing you will be using from day to day should be stored there.</div></div><hr />

And Blizzard announced last year at Blizzcon, they wanted expansions to be shorter... So there is no reason to believe they are holding out on something and force us to stay in this expansion for another year and a half.<br />
<br />
Be happy with what you got. This expansion came with upgraded engines, servers, graphics, story line, mainlining the whole &quot;I wish it was not such a pain in the butt to level another character.&quot;<br />
<br />
Imagine if the next expansion has no upgrades such as what we got, and the same amount of work is put in to actual content.<br />

These leaks are coming straight from blizzard. Cata wasn't a hit so they are moving on. Also I'm pretty sure they never intended for cata to keep moving along slowly. We fought off Ozumot. Killed Al'akair. Killed Ragnaros. Dealt with the stonemother so the planes should be realligned. <br />
<br />
<br />
I didn't think they would do a Cavern of Time raid because it just didn't seem feasable with the lore. <br />
<br />
<br />
Above all else I'm pretty sure blizzard has a release scheduled for later Q2 or early Q3 next year on that timeline that was leaked and floats around this site. The releases of WoW Brazil and whatnot really speaks volumes of the validity of that timeline so go figure: Blizzard wants to keep expansions moving quickly like they said they wanted.</div></div><hr />

Something tells me they intentionally made it seemingly tedious and annoying. I'm not saying it's hard to figure out, but it's a lot of crap when it could have just been &quot;click appearance tab, place in the appropriate slot&quot;.<br />
<br />
Though I will say as someone that couldn't care less about this feature... they made a good decision allowing ranged weapons to change type. I know several people that despise using guns (myself included)<br />
<br />
<br />
....I'm REALLY disappointed in you guys. Half the posts are complaints. Can't you guys be HAPPY about ANYTHING? I swear everyone here just wants to be miserable!<br />

Now while half of you stay here and rage about things you can't change.... I shall be preparing my character's future transmogrified sets! <br />

You will need the original item. Imagine the sort of UI they would need to implement to allow you to search every single piece of gear in the game you could possibly wear on your head. It would be a massively long list and would just never work. Best way is to require you to have both items, which is probably why they're giving us more 'bank' space, to allow us to throw all the gear in that we'll soon be farming. I do feel for those who have long since deleted items, especially items they can no longer get.</div></div><hr />

Frankly, I'm looking forward to seeing some creativity out of folks.

Cata also wasn't a full 10 levels, it was 80-85. And if you actually read the charts that got leaked for Blizz's sales plan, you'll see that this wasn't supposed to be a super long Xpac.<br />
<br />
Take a look: http://gamerinvestments.com/video-game-stocks/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/blizzard-product-slate-leaked.jpg<br />

Cata released near the end of 2010 going into 2011. The NEW Xpac, looks like it comes out mid-way 2012, not near the end of 2012/ beginning of 2013. Stop crying, sit down, and be patient.</div></div><hr />

I'm sure T13 will look just as good as the other tiers. I see no reason why they'd stop trying to make gear look good. Perhaps T13 will become the new 'must have' set.</div></div><hr />

Also, I am extremely disappointed that 4.3 will be the last. This Xpac then was WAY too short to be paying $80 for + the monthly fee. What a rip off. With BC we got Kara, ZA, Gruuls, Mag, SSC, TK, MH, BT and Sunwell. A total of 52 raid bosses. With Wrath we got Naxx, OS, Maly, Uld, ToC, ICC. A total of 52 raid bosses again. With Cata, so far we have BWD, Throne, BoT, and Firelands. Right now thats 20. The way they speak, there will only be one more instance. If we want any content close to what we saw in the lat two expansions, they need to make a 30+ boss raid. And we all know thats not gonna happen. Not to mention all the other xpacs had entire new continents, whereas in this we only got a few new zones. Barely enough content to really justify being called an xpac in the first place.

And 4.3 not only has a raid but also 3 new 5-mans. Yes, on raid-boss count we're down, but t11 was actually challenging (esp in comparison to Wrath's launch) and Firelands is a pretty decent middle-of-the-pack raid.

&quot;We would like to offer some alternative ways to get favorite items that are no longer available, such as perhaps the dungeon tier sets or the DK start gear. This is something we will expand over time – not every favorite item will be immediately available at launch. But we’ll keep a list of items that get requested by the players and work to get them in someday.&quot; <br />
<br />
---- Pretty much confirms that a) You need the item, b) No item restores and c) they're probably going to introduce an NPC with common gear items on it, but perhaps not at patch launch.</div></div><hr />

This is true, at least it was planned. The problem is they planned on making new raid tiers every 4-5 months so we'd still get a full xpac in 75% of the time and failed to deliver. They better make xpacs a lot cheaper. What happens going forward? Is the next xpac going to redo azeroth again? Deathwing's destruction would logically heal over time, right?</div></div><hr />

If you could just transmogrify your items without owning the cool sets, couldnt you just make your tier 11 look like tier 13?<br />

They really are going to be milking WoW in the next few years churning out expansion after exansion offering smaller and smaller content but with the same price.. i guess SWTOR or GW2 will be the next mmo to get any of my money. oh and i still blame ghostcrawler for current state of WoW.. what a douche.<br />

Of course Blizzard can't do anything about that, but guess what! the players can, so take a long hard look at how you act and treat others. I welcome the RFD with open arms, a feature extremely long over due. Side note, Blizzard tried to help keep the community in check and accountable with Real name id's...and the troll community help bash that down. Its funny millions of people embrace Facebook which does the very same thing. Blizzard tries to adapt, its the end of the world.</div></div><hr />

On a separate note: why on earth did we only get 5 levels worth of content and 3 raids this bloody expansion?!

Also, I don't understand what everyone has been saying about Cata being bad/a failure. What?? I've had a ton of fun playing this expansion. The raids have been interesting and challenging, and plenty of filler stuff to keep people busy. imho, they've done/are doing a great job.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anyway, sad that the solution for lack of content is bringing back old stuff... never helped any other game that had this &quot;feature&quot; (actually made it worse), why would be diferent in WoW? Nobody wants this as a excuse for new crap sets since you can always change it to a &quot;better one&quot;. Just look more and more like a private server where ppl do whatever they want, no matter if it's good or bad... and the lack of sense in this feature is so big... can change a gun to a bow, but not a sword to a mace?<br />
<br />
And raid finder? lolwhat? Luck of the Draw in there too? LOL<br />
<br />
Disposable stuff... more and more... faster xpacs instead of decent patches, more $$.<br />

Can blizzard not make anyone happy? 3 new dungeons, deathwing raid, Looking for Raid Finder, a armor bank and item transmuter good lord what more do you want? to me 4.3 looks like one of the best patches blizzard has released in quite some time even before cata if you ask me. Seriously just stop playing the game if you are just gonna bitch about everything, Blizzard is trying hard to please everyone and they just get nothing but bull shit, people should be happy how much blizzard puts into there games and listens to the players can hardly say that for most gaming companies these days.<br />
<br />
Before you(or any douche for that matter) starts flaming me ,this is a summary of what I noticed, which may or may-not be my opinion.<br />
The people who don't stop bitching are concerned about any one of the following:<br />
<br />
No love for PVP content(I myself am far from pvp oriented but I think that since vanilla only EotS and SotA added something cool to the BG's)<br />
The end coming too soon(this is the last raid. it has been confirmed)<br />
War of the Ancients being a simple 5-man at best.<br />
Abyssal Maw getting tossed out the window<br />
Void Storage not being an account wide bank extension.<br />
The Random raid finder causing a lot of chaos, with the overflow of unprepeared people.<br />
Older encounters getting swarmed by people who want the item looks and ninja them away from the ones who actually need them.</div></div><hr />

Abyssal Maw is out because it goes for a nice content for another $$ xpac, since they now want to sell more xpacs and give away less content in free patches.<br />

<br />
Nope, they are in fact going to delay the next expansion and sit there and make 6-7 retro tiers of DK gear that not many people are interested in. It's win-win.</div></div><hr />

You can't change the appearance of a legendary item, nor can you change an item's appearance into a legendary.<br />
<br />
Confirmed by Kaivax: http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/191174/transmogrification-is-coming<br />
<br />
You will not be able to transmogrify using a legendary item as either the source or the recipient of a change.<br />
<br />
Oh well, now I can wait to get that legendary staff...</div></div><hr />

A little disappointed that War of the Ancients is a 5man and not a raid though. But.... random raid finder? Good in principle but so many raids will collapse when after the third stupid wipe they go to kick someone and get &quot;that player cannot be kicked for another 43 minutes.&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
LFR - why do I have the feeling this would be directly linked to the above i.e. LFR lets you queue for all old raids available - LFR Sunwell :) Silly, I know, but still feels like it, can't imagine queueing up for Shannox when people fail at Stonecore first trash pack.</div></div><hr />

Even more similar than they look now? <br />
<br />
Personally I won't be going for straight up tiers, i like to mix and match, currently my fav outfit on my druid is a mix of cenarion tier and stormrage tier, with a green vest and a green quality corn staff, you can mix thing sup in so many ways, that there are endless amounts of choices, ofc if everyone sticks to one tier and they all decide they like the same one, then sure we will see alot of peeps the same, but it really isn't any different from how we all look right now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes like in real life where people like all the same things and wear all the same clothes, that is why everyone rides on the same mounts as well. Oh and everyone wearing the latest Tier sets is much better too...........your logic is utter and complete fail. People will adept to less popular things.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lockheed</div><div class="date">2011-08-17, 07:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">While I'm happy that they've finally made extra storage for old armor sets, removing the enchants from them upon putting them into Void Storage is unacceptable. The main reasons for keeping old items is for nostalgia and to show off around town; I don't want to have to keep putting mongoose or executioner back on my Warrior's Stormherald and other weapons, or to permanently lose my Mage's ZG shoulder, Helm and Leg enchants.<br />
We should be able to retain the enchants, I probably wont even use the new storage if we can't, but that could just be my perspective.</div></div><hr />

What, like they do now??? I think you and people of your thought process will be surprised what people will be doing after this. Tons of combinations and unique styles can be made. Think mix and match.</div></div><hr />

Cataclysm is 8 months old, the other expansions were at least 2 years old when the next expansion came out, so it sounds to early to kill Deathwing.3 new dungeons: why not, got tired of the current dungeons.but...What happened to the war of the ancients promise blizzard made?What happened to the abyssal maw dungeon or raid blizzard has promised? &quot;the storyline wasn't convincing enough/fitting.&quot; good excuse! it was a dungeon/raid i was looking forward too.What happened to the Maelstrom? It sounds odd to me that blizzard made this entire zone just to be visited twice.I can't remember where i red it, but i red about the goblins trying to get back Kezan like the trolls got the echo isles back, what happened to that?(i guess there would be something similar for the worgens)</div></div><hr />
