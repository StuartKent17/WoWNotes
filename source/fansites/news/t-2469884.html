<br />
is it only<br />
<br />
- wod added to timewalking<br />
- some quests for war campaign and professions<br />
- the 2 allied races<br />
- some new naga WQs<br />
- brawlers guild <br />
- small shit like rollercoster DMF, new holidays, etc<br />
<br />
?<br />
<br />
this sounds a bit lame. or is that 2-3 boss CoS raid also in there ? or a new dungeon ? or some improvements for warfronts or islands ? or class changes ? or some other „new“ content ?<br />
<br />
seems a bit „do new quests for 1-2 days and being finished with new content“ boring ? or not ?</div></div><hr />

To be fair, the list you gave yourself DOES seem quite impressive for a .x5 patch...<br />
<br />
It is very likely the CoS raid will open during 8.1.5, but technically speaking, it is 8.1 content, i would say, as that was the patch that added the portal + journal entries.<br />
<br />
Still, i'm totally on board with you on class tuning changes. Those are the #1 thing i want from .x5 patches, and so far 8.15 has none of them, only tooltip fixes for hotfixes that are already live. In Legion .x patches were for content and .x5 patches were for class tuning....i liked it that way. Now we have .x patches with no content (because it opens weeks later) and .x5 patches that just polish the previously gated content a little bit.<br />
<br />
Maybe Blizzard actuallay thinks that classes are so phenomenally fine that no changes are necessary? Spoiler alert: They are not. The state of tuning is not completely &quot;horrible&quot; i would say (apart from ~3 outliers) but there is room for improvement....<br />
<br />
One can only hope they are busy at work with the 8.2 neck changes which will add spec-specific active abilities and reserve all class changes for that patch? *sigh* ....which will be in summer....</div></div><hr />

<br />
you forgot the 2 boss raid 'crucible of storms' which leads us into 8.2 and beyond with the story, along with major groundwork most likely for the 'new' heart of azeroth system for 8.2.</div></div><hr />

<br />
there will be a looooong thirsty route in front of us.<br />
<br />
if they release 8.2 in may or end of may, with raid in maybe june/july, we have a raid, 2 additionally raid bosses and quests for around 5 hours (war campaign and professions) as solely pve content for the next 8-12 weeks. hmm...<br />
<br />
with no class changes, system changes, system features, warfront improvements or island improvements at all.<br />
<br />
cost effective develoment, eh ?<br />
<br />
yeah baby. welcome in 2019. ... :(<br />

<br />
yes and no. its a lot of cheap blender stuff to let it look like a lot. but all in all its a lot cheap copy paste shit, recycled shit or just style improvements. all in all we have content with 2 raid bosses and 5 hours of quests for war campaign and professions. for 8-12 weeks. not that great.<br />
<br />
i wish they pissed on all that shit and gave us class design changes and system features and improvements, and WF and island improvements instead that cheap crap. like a .5 patch should do.<br />

Naga Invasions? Did we see anything about this?<br />
<br />
i assume its exactly same as current invasions, but with that few new naga WQs. nothing that dramatically changes whats happening now. just a bit more cheap filler content.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Naga invasions are new World Quests. You go there and kill naga till you fill a bar to 100% and that's it. You get a item that increases your stat by 1000 for 1 hour in zandalari or kul tiras out door zones.</div></div><hr />
