Don't have your main raid times on the day that they have been shutting servers down, for the past 5 years?</div></div><hr />

What if your guild wants to raid 4 times a week to be a top server guild, and they cant raid on weekends for obvious reasons, tuesday wendsday and thursday are the three most common days to raid on, maybe monday too</div></div><hr />

<br />
This right here is why I'm pissed over this. In 5 years they haven't been able to figure out how to apply a patch without extending the downtime. Shouldn't they have implemented a new procedure by now to reduce the problems in patching? I understand that there are unforeseen technical issues regardless of how rigorously you test but I fail to understand how these issues happen EVERY patch. It's just sloppy.</div></div><hr />

&quot;The last remaining player in a random instance group can miss out on Random Dungeon loot&quot;<br />
<br />
What exactly does that mean?<br />
<br />
On top off that there is only an hour and a half till I'm supposed to START raiding (as in be there, start going) not counting time to set up and what not and when maintenance takes this ridiculously long people don't seem to show up.<br />
<br />
And before someone says &quot;its Tuesday there's maintnence&quot; We are sceduled to start raiding 4 hours after the server shoudl come back up, and &quot;unforseen&quot; problems happen all the time, last thursday we had login servers down in the US. Couldnt log in for 2 hours so its not like &quot;unforseen&quot; is any more an issue on tuesdays than any other day.</div></div><hr />

Oh no warcraft down for the first time in a while due to maintenance aren't you going to hate when this happens a lot more often at the beginning of cata. And, I don't see why they should give you a free day because you only play one realm and that realm is down so you don't come complaining that something is wrong and should get free x amount of days because they didn't fix what was all wrong.</div></div><hr />

I haven't had much interest in raiding this expansion because I haven't seen the challenge like I did in BC. Hopefully they make it exciting again.<br />
<br />
Also the whole guild and battlegroup thing will help the community a lot. Everyone is kept to themselves these days, it would be nice to actually have enjoyable social experiences in the game again. A lot of people don't see the upside to it but it makes a huge difference. <br />
Making people play like it's an MMO instead of like it's a solo game is great. <br />
<br />
I'm hoping I get in beta so I can give them some feed back.</div></div><hr />

Hey foo, I have been playing this game awhile. The times they've had the game down for most or all of a day or multiple days they always compensated. I wanna know if they'll still do it now :\ not everyone had their server down 24 hours and it seems unfair considering that time it was down others could play I WAS paying for it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is not why people are frustrated.<br />
We pay their bills and when they screw up they tell us, &quot;Sorry, we are having unexpected errors, thanks for your patience and cooperation.&quot;<br />
They assume we are patient with them and understanding of their continued failures after 5, nearly six years of them running the game.<br />
<br />
They do not attempt to tell us what the issues are or attempt to respond to our questions about the issues they say are occurring.<br />
<br />
They told us there would be an update at 4 but lied. 4 rolled around and they said they would have and ADDITIONAL update at 5.<br />
Are they stoned? They didn't give us ANY new information at 4. All we are saying, those of us &quot;QQing,&quot; is that we would at least like Blizz to own up to their failure and tell us things have gone wrong and they don't know when things will work. Maybe a little explanation of what issues are occurring. <br />
Honestly, I'm surprised that the greatest game makers in the WORLD have this level of crap Customer Service.</div></div><hr />

Even if they do this for 5 years THEY CANNOT PREDICT WHAT THE HELL WILL HAPPEN. Some things that fixed it before may not fix it now, so then they have to fix it a different way.<br />
<br />
For the love of god, stop your whining and play some LoL, HoN, 360 or some other game for god's sake instead of crying that you cannot play the game for 1 day. Also to all you raider's just take this as a &quot;break&quot; to look up the strat's refine what you will do on fight's your guild is stuck on. Trust me on this, your guildies will thank you for spending this maintenance studying on the fights instead of bitching on the forums.</div></div><hr />

Actually, you're the idiot. You cannot even begin to comprehend the complexity of all of the coding in this game. What do you think the extension on the maintenance is for?

<br />
Since when does an update have to consist of new information? An update is an update. If they have nothing new to report would you rather them not say anything until they do? People bitch when they &quot;keep players in the dark&quot; and they bitch when they update every hour but don't give people what they want..../sigh<br />
<br />
There was in fact new information - that they would again update us in another hour. While I'm sure various reasons are causing the extended downtime, they've never been ones to divulge the specifics. The only say that they are having issues, still working on it etc. They are still having issues and are still working on it - those were the updates whether they said the same things or not.</div></div><hr />

In about 8 hours it'll be 24 hours since Maintenance began. At the very least, we'll all be entitled to some free WoW time or some other form of compensation. It's not unreasonable. I disagree with those who have but there've been people who've &quot;left&quot; WoW for other MMOs (which I'd rather not name 'cause we know what they are) due to their &quot;dissatisfaction&quot;.

<br />
It's not because Blizzard hasn't touched on PVP changes they're going to fine tune yet, or that the slightest mention would cause a lot of butthurt. Surely, the fact that literally 'no one gives a toss' is not a good enough answer.<br />
<br />
With that said, yes this was kind of boring. :v<br />

<br />
TOO SOON. IT WILL ALWAYS BE TOO SOON.<br />
<br />
Also, if people would stop bitching each time maintenance got extended, there probably wouldn't be so much backlash. In my opinion $15 a month (per head) is a bit too little to be a baby sitter.</div></div><hr />

No, we expect you to not act like a spoilt brat that thinks the world is just handed to you on a silver platter. Shit happens. Deal with it. The terms and conditions you agreed to (which you no doubt just ticked and clicked next) state they can do whatever they want with the servers and your characters. You don't even own your characters. Blizzard owns them. You are just paying to rent a service.<br />
<br />
So you can whinge and bitch and moan and cry all you want, but you are the one that agreed to the terms in the end. When you get a mortgage one day try crying to the bank and saying it's unfair when they increase interest rates.</div></div><hr />

Some people area going to lose in the area of 34+ hours of playtime over the last couple weeks. Not sure where Months and months came from. These same people were also wasting 3-4 weeks straight trying to play the game with unbearable latency issues. Like, everyone loves 5 minute loot lag. Players being frozen for five minutes because they decided to get some mana strudels, warlock candy or checked the trash mob to see if there was a BoE.<br />

Some people area going to lose in the area of 34+ hours of playtime over the last couple weeks. Not sure where Months and months came from. These same people were also wasting 3-4 weeks straight trying to play the game with unbearable latency issues. Like, everyone loves 5 minute loot lag.

<br />
Anywho, they knew it was patch day. They knew that when they add a number to it (not the build number after the final &quot;.&quot;) that something goes wrong. So why the hell did they say 3 am to 11 am pacific time? I guess they will never learn, and neither will the players who complain.<br />

You see... I am gone over ten hours a day doing this thing that you call work. Raiding a couple days a week is what I call a little relaxation. I am not in a big fuss because the server is down and I cannot collect &quot;phat loots&quot;. It is a rather inconvenience to have your server be one of the main factors why your guild cannot be bothered to even attempt to get 9/10/11 or 12/12 HM's. <br />
<br />
On top of all of this. Most of the raiding population that play the game want some new content. If this patch has so majorly screwed up the game that it is nearly taking a full 24 hour cycle to fix then it does not look good knowing that new content is not coming until the European and Korean versions of 3.3.5 are deployed.<br />

The ToS and EULA is what you agree to in order to use their service which they provide. It is a legal, binding agreement. End of.

I don't know about the US, but where I live no company has ever tried to enforce their ToS or EULA in court, mostly because the prevailing legal opinion is that they're unenforceable.<br />
<br />
i'm pretty sure one of the ToS or EULA in European Blizzard notes once stated when agreeing to it we are bound by californian law....<br />
<br />
which would be laughable to enforce in Scotland, the judges here would throw the case out.. but more than likely it'd be handed by small claims court. <br />
<br />
But then European courts tend not to like the US ToS's or EULA's mostly because they're stupid. no offence to americans. i know plently of bright ones.<br />
<br />
obama isn't a bright one though, blaming BP... when really that's not the case. BP won the contract. But all those people making the pipes, drilling for oil, employees all stationed around that area WERE AMERICANS.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cirque</div><div class="date">2010-06-23, 08:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I figure most bugs are such a huge hassle to fix (its (my apostophs are not working for some obscure reason, guess I should nerdrage my keyboard out of the window now - its always been a crap thing) extremely complicated to find the cause of a bug and its true that most bugs simply are not worth that time (yet). However, the risk is that very annoying bugs keep being pushed forward in time to fix such as the warlock minion health bug (they say it occurs with infernals, but as especially pvping locks will be able to tell you, it can happen with all pets). Also, some bugs really are annoying and should have been adressed ages ago, and from my limited knowledge shouldnt be that incredibly hard to fix either (at least as compared to the warlock pet bug), such as the blessing of forgotten kings issue. Thats the kind of bug that can affect every player and will affect every player without fail (unlike again the warlock bug, that only affects a smaller % of warlocks on a regular basis).<br />
<br />
Whats a bit meh with that list, is that tons of other issues known forever havent been mentioned at all. Such as the bug with Demonic Empowerment or the issue with Shadow Embrace (excuse me for playing a warlock, but Im sure every class has its issues, like a mage Ignite munching (though that technically isnt a bug)). I mean, I realize theyre not going to do much about it (clearly, since the Shadow Embrace issue has been here since 3.0 if I recall), but just knowing they know makes a difference. (just like it would make a difference for the Americans if Blizzard would just have *said* something about why the servers were down for so long, being kept in the dark just sucks. I hope everything is up and running again there, guess we are up next week (you were the guinnea pigs, but I think its safe to assume our maintenance will be extended a few times just like the other times when we came second xD)).<br />
<br />
In other words, I dont think Blizzard is wrong by being so difficult about fixing bugs when the majority of them is not even close to gamebreaking, but I also think they should be a bit less relaxed about very annoying bugs that are definitely fixable (blood elf shoulder attachment point being an issue since TBC - come on).</div></div><hr />

I wouldn't write this patch off as minor... Most of my addons were crapped out. The battlenet chat thing isn't large as in 'game content' but it's pretty massive considering you can chat across realms AND games. Yeah. Besides, this is nothing compared to years past.</div></div><hr />

Do you see Blizz in any big hurry to inform us of what is going wrong or when to actually expect things to get better?<br />
<br />
Sorry, but you're kind of an idiot. There's a difference between a lack of communication about an unexpectedly crashed server and a *planned maintenance* I work for a large scale data center with high end Unix research machines. When we take them down for planned maintenance they stay down until they're fixed. We provide estimates on how long the maintenance will be, of course, but those estimates are wrong at least half the time. It's the nature of the business. And when we bust a down time estimate we tell out users essentially just what Blizzard told everyone. &quot;Still working on it, we'll let you know.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Well as a few people have pointed out, seeing as this is a paid service we are entitled to know what's going on. We're not bitching about the extended downtime, just exercising our right to request more information about a game we pay a monthly subsciption to. If this was a a Free MMO (many of which have real good Customer Service, actually) they'd be disinclined but this is different. As someone pointed out, Blizzard needs to make sure they don't repeat the mistake BP made and have us waiting 64-straight days. <br />
<br />
In about 8 hours it'll be 24 hours since Maintenance began. At the very least, we'll all be entitled to some free WoW time or some other form of compensation. It's not unreasonable. I disagree with those who have but there've been people who've &quot;left&quot; WoW for other MMOs (which I'd rather not name 'cause we know what they are) due to their &quot;dissatisfaction&quot;. I don't see myself doing that though XD<br />
<br />
And when they tell you that the database optimization is going slower than they expected, or they're refining the routing tables to correct some unexpected latency, or the they're getting strange and unexpected disconnects between the doThisStuffInDal service and the doThisOtherStuffInOrg service... you're going to do what, exactly? It's vaguely possible that whatever is wrong is an actual comprehensible problem to a fairly expert computer user, but far more more likely that it's got to do with obscure internal communication issues between a bunch of services, servers, and code. Even an expert would probably not understand what's wrong unless he or she were first given an extensive orientation on the basic architecture of the game servers.<br />
<br />
It amazes me that people think a major software update on literally hundreds of server clusters is just like installing the latest version of Office on your PC. Hell, even that has occasionally been know to explode into hours of work when something crashes in mid-install.<br />
<br />
Oh, and to all the people that are saying &quot;if this was a fortune 500 company IT department, they'd all be fired by now!&quot;. You may very well be right, but it's completely immaterial for several reasons. First, the scope of work is completely different. It's essential that corporate e-mail, file and intranet servers are *always* up, but it's not essential that they always provide a near perfect almost latency free experience. They are therefore designed for redundancy and reliability first, performance second. They do things like put redundant servers in different data centers for instance. that would never work for WoW, the communications latency would be to high. They also don't typically take essential services offline completely, because they can work on one server at a time. Take down the PDC and one of the backups can pick up the slack, you can't do that in WoW. Everything has to be upgraded at once. <br />

Even ignoring these considerations, it's not even completely true that services like e-mail and CMS systems in fortune 500 companies never go down. It happens less often, true, but sometimes patches or upgrades have to be done on all the systems at once. The difference of course, is that when you do these things late at night in a normal business it has minimal affect on operations. Blizzard has no such options.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This has been an issue for months now. it's not a new issue introduced in 3.3.5<br />
<br />
Otherwise, I'd list the &quot;offhand weapon hides when you swing during a shapeshift&quot; bug as well.</div></div><hr />
