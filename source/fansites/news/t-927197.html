Which is why you have a thing called &quot;redundancy&quot;.<br />
<br />
The curse network appears to be a run by a bunch of retards, thus you have downtime like this.<br />

Obviously you didn't read what actually happened. The backup system also failed, and what took time was making sure none of the data was corrupted after the failures.<br />

I didn't insult YOU, I insulted your network admins, who are clueless. And being sorry doesn't mean they get to automatically skirt any responsibility.<br />

<br />

Yeah I did, and it reads like a bunch of clueless network admins with Microsoft Certifications got caught off guard. (which happens when clueless people run the network).<br />

<br />
I actually do work with servers for a living, and yeah I have sympathy for Curse and MMO, I've had my fair share of outages, just they happen when I'm in the lab or on our test machines, not on the live network. :/<br />
<br />
As a sign of goodwill for you Boubouille, here's some free advice for the curse admins:<br />
<br />
a) Backup your data REGULARLY.<br />
b) test that backup data REGULARLY.<br />
c) HAVE a backup strategy IN PLACE.<br />
d) TEST THAT BACKUP STRATEGY IS 100% RELIABLE. WHICH MEANS:<br />
e) have a backup strategy that DOES NOT at any point involve sitting on hold with HP. (or microsoft? wtf lol? windows server? are you kidding me?)<br />
<br />
I know these sound like basic sort of stuff but yeah that's my point, hire competent network admins and I wouldn't be here telling you why the network admins are clueless and you wouldn't have had that downtime(and I wouldn't have been banned :(). Have fun. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
We had backup strategies. They exploded 2 hours after the first outage.<br />

As far as I know it is hard to use exploded hardware O_o But if my basic knowledge on exploded hardware is wrong, then please do tell me how to use it. It might be useful one day!</div></div><hr />

<br />
wow, just wow, even competent admins wont smudge that on another admin's face, you havent &quot;yet&quot; had a downtime on live servers, but its still possible, what if the moon suddenly hits the earth and wipes out everything, is your god-perfect contingency protected? lighten up, even if its 1 in a 10000000000000000000000, chances are it will still happen. man its like your life depended on mmo-champ =\<br />
<br />
on a side note, you bashing windows servers too? lol, just to give you a head's up, most of the hacked servers the last month were based on linux. (solaris &amp; redhat enterprise) you blaming an OS just questions your &quot;real&quot; god-like prowess.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't know your technical expertise on the matter but these things should have been covered in the backup strategy, every possible issue should be covered and planned for, even multiple issues occurring simultaneously... but it's not uncommon for backup strategies to fail, it's because nobody likes doing them, and it's a common theme with system/network admins who don't get it drilled into them just how crucial it is.<br />
<br />
<br />
We also had consultants on site and worked closely with HP and Microsoft to figure out if there was a way to speed up things without risking losing data without much success.<br />

<br />
<br />
Things break constantly because unqualified people manage them, and departments stop communicating because the connecting technologies are always &quot;somebody else's problem&quot;. The industry gets flooded with cowboys who have no concept of system and data integrity, who don't take care with the systems they are put in charge of, who don't bother securing things in a proper fashion so that data doesn't leak everywhere. It's almost a daily event to hear of some horrendously scary security breech that affects millions of innocent people who put their trust in these idiots.<br />
<br />
Given the history of Curses's security problems and the data crash that I don't ever remember happening on your old host, I'm just here to tell them how much they(curses's network admins) suck. (Not you Boubouille, I love you &lt;3)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh look, someone without a clue! Of course you CAN plan a 3rd and 4th and 5th redundancy but come on...<br />
<br />
1. Curse isn't THAT important it's just a game site.<br />
<br />
2. Curse probably doesn't have the necessary financial strength to even support such a scenario.<br />
<br />
3. 100% certainty is A MYTH. Even 10^n Backup redundancies can mathematically fail all at once.<br />

The odds of all that stuff happening at once was astronomical, and seeing the site down (along with the inability to access other sites in the network) was annoying, but we lived. Hopefully the future is less clouded by moments of chaos like this one, and filled with more fun (and information) yet to come.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's hilarious man. :)<br />
<br />
<br />
you havent &quot;yet&quot; had a downtime on live servers, but its still possible, what if the moon suddenly hits the earth and wipes out everything, is your god-perfect contingency protected?<br />
<br />
&quot;Major catastrophes&quot;<br />
<br />
Page 50, so yeah...?<br />
<br />
The pirate bay had the US government and the swiss government come into their data centre and just plain took the servers away, yet they had less downtime than curse just did.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
lighten up, even if its 1 in a 10000000000000000000000, chances are it will still happen. man its like your life depended on mmo-champ =\<br />
<br />
Ok so you aren't in the IT industry at all, you just like to pretend you are. <br />
<br />
<br />
on a side note, you bashing windows servers too?<br />
<br />
Only after they crash and have a major network outage.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
lol, just to give you a head's up, most of the hacked servers the last month were based on linux. (solaris &amp; redhat enterprise) you blaming an OS just questions your &quot;real&quot; god-like prowess.<br />
<br />
You mean cracked? And yeah so wut? Insecure servers are insecure, news at 11.</div></div><hr />

I had similar situation in my company (and work is connected with one of the biggiest credit card companies, don't want to advertise it now). When stuff started failing it was going one by one,,, It was cataclysm in our server rooms. Restoring parts of databases took us much longer than anyone could expected since stuff keeped failing. At the end we replaced most of our hardware. Checking data to get it up again took ages, we actually had team of tons of ppl manually working on processing stuff till we get all up and running. It's &quot;Murphy's law&quot; I guess in action. only thing that didn't happened is ultimate one, loss of all data. Well actually there is 0.0000000000000001% chance thoose days to loose actually all data, but restoring it up and checking all to be sure everything is in place to make it &quot;live&quot; again is huuuge and painfull job to do. So I have huuge sympathy for u ppl. Keep up good work, and well you learned couple stuff in process of fixing it, don't u? hehe. <br />

All we can really do is hope something like this never happens again, atleast not to this extent.<br />

I guess Boub and everyone at Curse now understands how Blizzard feels when things go bad and 11 mil subscribers ''patiently'' wait for realms to go back up. It was dull to get to mmo-champ and just see an orange error.</div></div><hr />
