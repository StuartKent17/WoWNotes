Some of the changes to the paladin's retribution tree posted yesterday (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=23233.0) are being hotfixed to live servers today. I guess it totally rules out the possibility of seeing patch 3.0.3 on live servers this week (It wouldn't make much sense to hotfix something a few hours before a class balancing patch). We'll probably have to wait one more week to see it deployed on all realms, for the time being you can always read :<br />
Patch 3.0.3.9138 Recap (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=22989.0) (Oct 25)<br />
Patch 3.0.3.9095 Recap + Patch notes (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=21976.0) (Oct 17)<br />
We are going to hotfix the nerfs to Judgement of the Wise (from 33% to 15%) and Seal and Judgement of Command (down 20% damage) to live. We need to start getting more testing on these changes right away to see what they do to Retribution in PvE and PvP. We still intend to lower the damage of other Seals and Judgements (except one - see below), but to hotfix those requires touching a lot more data so we think that change can wait for the 3.0.3 patch on live.<br />
<br />
We are also hotfixing the beta to return Seal and Judgement of Blood and the Martyr back up to 95% of where the used to be. Live will just never get the nerf to these abilities at all. Hopefully this will compensate PvE Retadins for relying less on more expensive AE abilities that risk putting them out of mana.<br />
<br />
To summarize:<br />
<br />
Live (3.0.2 build) -- Judgement of Wise change, Seal and Judgement of Command change.<br />
Beta (3.0.3 build) -- All nerfs already active, but Blood and Martyr un-nerfed.<br />
Next Live patch (to 3.0.3 build) -- Catches Live up to Beta. I can't give you an estimate for 3.0.3 on Live yet, but it will be before Lich King goes live on Nov 13. <br />
<br />
[...]<br />
<br />
As I posted in one thread, you should be able to use those core abilities (Divine Storm, a Judgement / Seal and Crusader Strike) without going OOM. Some players are finding that to be true, so please let us know if you aren't.<br />
<br />
If you do add Consecration or healing, your mana should drop down lower. You're making a choice not to be sustainable in order to do something else.<br />
<br />
Divine Plea should help offset that at 80. Some of the Int on your gear should help offset that for now. <br />

Reminder - Hallow's End meta-achievement and mask achievement<br />
The mask achievement will remain in the game but not be part of the meta-achievement to become &quot;The Hallowed&quot;. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/11829378724-the-hollows-end-achievment.html))<br />
<br />
Class balancing at level 70<br />
Keep in mind classes will get new spells and abilities going from 70-80. Some of these will add new mechanics to certain classes and we must balance around that. Classes are always primarily balanced around the end game when we can look at everything a class has against all other classes. While you see the end game at 70, we've been developing with 80 in mind for quite some time now. <br />
<br />
Class balancing in patch 3.0.3<br />
The class adjustments to which you're referring that are coming in the next minor patch are primarily related to class performance at level 80. It is incorrect to argue that we're tuning damage output due to class performance at level 70, thereby asserting that these classes will be underwhelming at level 80. <br />
<br />
Party/Raid wide buffs<br />
There are a few buffs that are still party-wide and not raid. Typically these are spells which would have felt really lame with the lower numbers needed to justify them going raid-wide. Vampiric Embrace is another example. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/8/11829378911-are-we-the-only-class-with-party-wide-buffs.html))<br />

End of zombie plague<br />
I did say last week that the event would only last days, not weeks. To me that means 2-6 days. The event ran exactly as we planned with the most severe day being the last: Sunday. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/11829528965-proofzombie-infestation-was-suppose-to-end.html))<br />
<br />
Focus on paladin in the last few days<br />
What I hope the paladin community understands is I did try and spend a lot of time in this forum over the last couple of days. But that came at the expense of 9 other classes who probably feel pretty neglected about now (not to mention the PvP, tradeskills and raid forums). Just try and keep that in mind if I have to spend a lot of time with another class soon. I just about reached my capacity for reading threads yesterday. I can't do that personally in every class forum regularly. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/5/11829519101-thank-you.html))<br />

Finger of Frost in 3.0.3<br />
<br />
In order to get the same effect from Fingers of Frost as from actual frozen targets, we would have to set up the spell the same way as freezing, so that you could sneak that Ice Lance in between Frostbolts. Right now you get 2 big hits from Fingers of Frost, which you rightly want to spend on Frostbolt. If we changed Fingers of Frost so that Frostbolt always broke it, then you would want to get that Ice Lance in there, but your overall dps would go down. We'd need to compensate Frost some other way for that nerf, and it's the kind of thing that might not be popular with the mage community because we'd be nerfing Fingers of Frost's damage potential in order to force you into using Ice Lance all in the name of more interesting rotations. (Obviously we're not that nervous about making unpopular changes when we think they are warranted, and overall encouraging players to use different kinds of spells is a good thing.)<br />
<br />
Of course if we also made Fingers of Frost (or Ice Lance) better, then we're just going to have problems with Frost in PvP.<br />
<br />
Frost's PvE dps is very good right now -- if anything it's a little closer to Fire than we predicted. If Frost starts to fall off for any reason, that would be a good opportunity to revisit FoF to see if we can get more of the behavior you're describing, because ultimately I agree it would be cool to see more PvE Ice Lances.

Mana issues<br />
We don't want mana to be irrelevant (for any class) but we don't want it to be so limiting that you spend a great portion of a long fight on fumes. When you hit that point is a little subjective and also varies based on gear and skill.<br />
<br />
Consectation and Holy Wrath (and to a lesser extent Divine Storm) are AE spells, and those are priced so that they aren't as efficient against single targets. These would be the equivalent of a hunter using Volley or a mage using Arcane Explosion against single targets. They are useful tools in your arsenal and sometimes you are in a situation where you're mana rich or you need to burn down a mob at any cost. Exorcism is a single target spell and shouldn't be too expensive, but it's also not something you can use in every fight. <br />
<br />
[...] Now as I posted in another thread, if Ret paladins can't do decent damage without relying on those AEs, then that is a problem we need to look at. <br />
<br />
Skill rotation and mana usage<br />
We think you can go almost indefinetely on mana by using Divine Storm, Crusader Strike and a Seal / Judgement. If you want to add things to that, Consecration, Hammer or a heal perhaps, your mana will start to dip, but Divine Plea should make up for that. In PvP, you can make the choice to blow all of your mana knowing that you have time before the next fight to build your reserves back up. Or if you want to go from target to target with no downtime, don't blow all of your mana. <br />
<br />
Mana drain<br />
We will do some tests and analysis of whether Ret is too susceptible to mana drains in PvP since that seems to be something the community is worried about. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/5/11829528757-mana-regen-vs-mana-drain-effects.html))<br />
<br />
Holy DPS<br />
As soon as we're comfortable that we haven't over-nerfed Ret, and a couple of other things, we're going to look at healer dps again to make sure you can solo or throw the occasional damage spell in a group. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/5/11829579241-nonsarcastic-holy-dps-thread-sorry-gc.html))</div></div><hr />

But in all fairness I skipped the daily fire thingy almost every day and I slack with trick and treat. So it might be very hard in 1 year. But it should probably be doable in the 2nd year. Unless ofcourse you get very unlucky with all the same masks..</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am coming with any suggestions since I am not a beta tester, but I would like to say something on behalf of my current situation.<br />
<br />
I now go oom with using my core abilities along with 1 HoW. In PVP we will get drained (arena mostly) and we need to use all our cc abilities + healing. I would not mind 5% more mana since we also need to rebuff our seals (or just 3%). In PVE we will have to shoot our HoW constantly, but there we get mana from priests, totems etc. Should not be a problem.<br />
<br />
I would not call it unfair if we got sufficient manareturns to be able to cast a little heal, use our core abilities and all other PVP related spells. They just need to either cc us or drain us; I see np in being able to use core abilities + cc abilities if we are not being drained/focused.<br />
<br />
Other than that, fine with the mana thing.<br />
<br />
And to Genotsknots: really, it is truly boring to use 3 spells only... And for minutes =P</div></div><hr />

I can drain you, but I can also be drained. I have 6kmana. The only useful form of return is to A) go to AotV, which cuts my DPS in half and forces me to go 'on the run' until I can regain mana for awhile or B) FD and hope I can sit out the timer in arena (4+ seconds) to sit/drink a little.<br />
<br />
What in the hell is the difference from you guys?<br />
<br />
The only thing I can use while OOM is autofire or melee (which, atm, does not return mana).<br />
<br />
And yet you guys think because you have mana issues now you are...somehow...special? Or entitled to review?<br />
<br />
Face the facts: You guys facerolled your keyboards while /laugh(ing) at everyone. When people started posting that you should be initially reviewed you said 'QQ more noob, l2p.' Now you've been nerfed and the only thing I keep reading about paladins is OMG I HAVE TO SIT AND DRINK NOW.<br />

Welcome to more than a year of hunter issues in Pvp, Pve, and Arena (which is not like either of the two, and why I push it into its own category).<br />

If the enemies in PVP know a little about PVP; drain us, it's easy. Then We'll be a warrior without rage, meaning no intercept either.<br />
<br />
And Konju... We are, first of all, not upset! Wrong of you to claim so. Our problem is that we in 80 will get no int on our gear and that our abilities costs a great deal of our mana. 12% for HoW, same for seal, 10% on DS, 4% on judgement, 6% on CS (all this is approx, cba with finding the right ones; 12% on HoW is correct though).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ahh I don't care at all anyway, being gloated at after being beaten by a ret paladin, being completley face rolled in BGs by 5 paladins then spat on in one BG making us lose the game, after all the whining threads about how you're the most broken specc in the game for the past few weeks has made me lose all respect in Paladins.</div></div><hr />

ohh sure let me use a better dps rotation not to go oom in 2 min. cs and judgements anyway DS hits for nothing now, its retarded. they removed the only thing that made the class different burst, and made it a warrior wanna be with a holy bleeding...<br />

You whine about mana issues if you're being mana drained.<br />
In a way you're suggesting that there should be no way that you can be mana drained, thus making the viper sting, mana burn and (lol) warlock mana drain completely useless.<br />
<br />
Before the nerf it was completely, utterly impossible to mana drain a ret paladin. Even if you lived long enough to cast your drain spell once or twice (The lock drain, for example, is a 5-second channeled dispellable spell that drains 150 mana per second), the paladin would just swing at you a couple of times and be back to 100% mana again. And as the blue says, you'll get divine plea at 80...<br />
<br />
IMO ret pala mana regeneration is still way out of hand.<br />
Hunters will lose 50% dps when they regen mana. Warlocks trade their health to mana and use a GCD. Mages need to channel their mana regen spell. Paladins keep melting faces.<br />
<br />
In PvP, it's a part of your class to be able to go oom. If nobody should face mana problems in PvP under any circumstances, why have the mana draining spells in the game.<br />
<br />
Learn to live with it. Don't be so god damn unreasonable.</div></div><hr />

the problem is that at 80 all those classes have a huge mana pool compared to the 6k pool ret will have so, how many mana burn, mana drains, viper sting, will require to make ret completely useless?</div></div><hr />

You whine about mana issues if you're being mana drained.<br />
In a way you're suggesting that there should be no way that you can be mana drained, thus making the viper sting, mana burn and (lol) warlock mana drain completely useless.<br />
<br />
Before the nerf it was completely, utterly impossible to mana drain a ret paladin. Even if you lived long enough to cast your drain spell once or twice (The lock drain, for example, is a 5-second channeled dispellable spell that drains 150 mana per second), the paladin would just swing at you a couple of times and be back to 100% mana again. And as the blue says, you'll get divine plea at 80...<br />
<br />
IMO ret pala mana regeneration is still way out of hand.<br />

You get your face melted by a OOM Retpally who is only auto-attacking (at least 3.0+ sec swings and totally kittable without mana to even cast a dispelable and etc. HoF?). Dude, you're really bad pvper.<br />
<br />
You just switch aspects to regain mana while still fighting! Hello, if the pally doesn't have any mana, he can't even cast Seal/Judgement of Wisdom (and attacking the target won't get the judgement refreshed anymore, so, not even works having the target alread judged before you went OOM). Last time I've checked, the OOM retpally can't just ignore you and recover his mana (only maybe with Divine Plea, but with mana drain eating you up? LOL). Unless you're really that bad to let it happen (hello silence). What is the diference between mage/lock/hunter and a paladin? You're all ranged! Have a way easier time to &quot;replenish mana while having drawbacks&quot;.<br />
<br />
As someone stated before, except for lvl 70+ Divine Plea, every way a Paladin has to regain mana NEEDS mana to start with it. With ridiculous mana pools at 80 versus the other mana users, with will be just that easy to get a Ret pally OOM (just like it always was before 3.0.2).</div></div><hr />

Warlock mana drain is 5 seconds channeled. <br />
Consider that is ticks for 150 (= total of 750 per channel) if you have adequate resilience. If you have 6k mana, that would take 8 drains = 40 seconds of uninterrupted cast time. I mean, if he paladin just stands still and doesn't regenerate mana at all. See how ridiculous that sounds even in the best scenario (which will never ever happen in reality)?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mahtamori</div><div class="date">2008-10-28, 01:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So...let me get this straight..you guys are upset you run out of mana 'all the time' -- I'm a hunter. I can drain you, but I can also be drained. I have 6kmana. The only useful form of return is to A) go to AotV, which cuts my DPS in half and forces me to go 'on the run' until I can regain mana for awhile or B) FD and hope I can sit out the timer in arena (4+ seconds) to sit/drink a little.<br />
<br />
What in the hell is the difference from you guys?<br />
1. We're going to have 4.7k mana at 80, which is an estimated 40% of what Hunters will have.<br />
2. We don't have Aspect of the viper, our mana regaining abilities aren't anywhere near as effective (although they're pretty darn easy to use)<br />
3. Our gear contains no mp5, our talents contain no mp5, and we haven't got a pet which can give us mana.<br />
<br />
<br />
The only thing I can use while OOM is autofire or melee (which, atm, does not return mana).<br />
And Aspect of the Viper, as well as all pet abilities. Paladins need to pray for 5% base mana so they can judge or wait until Divine Plea is off cooldown (and not dispelled).<br />
<br />
<br />
And yet you guys think because you have mana issues now you are...somehow...special? Or entitled to review?<br />
All classes are entitled to reviews, but Paladins are special since they're the only class that was rebuilt nearly from scratch.<br />
<br />
<br />
Face the facts: You guys facerolled your keyboards while /laugh(ing) at everyone. When people started posting that you should be initially reviewed you said 'QQ more noob, l2p.' Now you've been nerfed and the only thing I keep reading about paladins is OMG I HAVE TO SIT AND DRINK NOW.<br />
You mean like Rogues did for most part of TBC?<br />
Now, I'm not saying it's easy to play Rogues, but they were decidedly good (and still are) but that doesn't mean it's really face-rolling.<br />
<br />
<br />
Welcome to more than a year of hunter issues in Pvp, Pve, and Arena (which is not like either of the two, and why I push it into its own category).<br />
Thank you, mate, but I've played Paladin for all of TBC, and a lot of us have played one for vanilla as well. We know. The Light know we know.<br />
<br />
<br />
Please stop with the posts about it -- return to the game and test it out for awhile. Get used to it before you start rampaging about how 'you were lied to' etc...<br />
After patch 1.0.1, 1.9, 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3.0 it does get a bit old to go with the &quot;lied to again&quot; routine, yeah...<br />
<br />
<br />
Adapt or reroll, that's the only suggestions anyone at this point can offer.<br />
<br />
Above all else, stop speculating on returns until you've actually tried it.<br />
<br />
I'll go with reroll, a bit sick of the roller coaster ride. Gives me a bit of time gathering mats for professions as well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am sorry mister, but you're wrong in 2 ways here.<br />
<br />
First, I don't play a hunter even though I know how they play.<br />
<br />
Second, a paladin never starts an arena match (and let's face it, arena is the thing that matters and which is why we're having these heated discussions) OOM. Considering the fact that if you don't suck, your target is down before your mana can be drained or used by yourself, your logic is flawed. Even better, if someone tries to mana burn you, you can just /shrug and have fun time killing them since they'll be dealing little-to-no damage meanwhile.<br />
<br />
These changes help fixing ret pala domination in Battlegrounds since you may no longer be able to chain 3-shot people without ever going oom. But these mana changes do little to help with getting devastated by ret palas with a full mana bar at the start of the game, and thus the overall damage reduction comes in handy for general balance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
that's only pve. using the &quot;recommended&quot; rotation by ghostcrawler, we need at least 22% mana return from judgment of the wise to come out +/-0 mana.<br />
<br />
using even one of the abilities like cons/Ex/HoW not even the former 33% BM return will sufice and the lil ret will be oom in no time.<br />

i'm just bit confused what calculations GC and his team made, to come to such strange numbers ;)<br />

<br />
You are examining this from the perspective of the weakest mana drain, only. To be quite frank, the warlock mana drain sucks compared to the hunter and priest mana drains. <br />
<br />
To give you some perspective on how bad mana drains are on ret paladins at level 80, watch this video with viper sting ( http://files.filefront.com/VIper+STUNG+0001wmv/;12180100;/fileinfo.html ). Mana drains are not percentage based, and hit for a set amount of mana. Considering that level 80 ret / prot paladins only have 5,500 mana, a 1500 mana burn from a priest, or a viper sting from a hunter will completely deny ret and prot paladins of mana.</div></div><hr />

Currently mana burn kills 1500 ish mana...a ret pally at 80 in full pvp epics has around 5-6k mana...we dont have a distance closer...so as we run at the other team if he gets off 3 mana burns in the beginning of the match we are done. Is there any other class that can be rendered useless within 5 seconds</div></div><hr />

Going OOM is normal for a caster. And yes, once you're OOM you are useless. Pots, innervates, refreshment and so on are there to help delay going OOM, but mana is designed to be a limited resource. Rogues have a limited resource in terms of regeneration speed. Warriors have a limited resource in terms of being hit/doing dps (becomes untrue at high end PvE but mostly true). Death Knights have a limited resource in terms of rune CDs.<br />
Of all those, casters are the one that are the worst off once their pool is down it's the hardest/longuest to fill up again. But we have quite some time where we can use it freely before going OOM (compared to a rogues burst which is intense but shorter for example).<br />
<br />
Basically, going OOM during a fight is normal. Going OOM right when the boss dies is optimal.<br />
What would be abnormal would be going OOM before the end of a fight (with correct gear/skill/... and the fight being it's normal duration) and with all mana-regen buffs, ie with no way to avoid it (adapting the rotation a bit, ...). That's the only abnormal scenario.</div></div><hr />

first off if a mage dies to a ret pally they suck...its simple. Mages farm ret pallies.<br />
<br />
Right now I would say in pvp gear the only people i can kill that quick are shammies and resto druids...and thats only if they dont have their trinket available. If the class can trinket a stun then a ret pally cant kill any pvp geared player that quick</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Arena 1vs1? never heard of it. Major Flaw on your logic. You're doing low damage while easily draining all his mana (and fast at 80), but your partner will do it for you.<br />
<br />
And also, paladins and everyone else, don't start a arena match next to each other. Go Go mana drain + kite/silence/many more things. And remember, you goal is lvl 80. You won't need that much time spent draining ret pallies mana. Besides that, you'll have way more HP and resilience that you have now (those 3k-6k crits will be nicelly /lol).<br />
<br />
Ret paladins, the only burst spec, that can't burst. It won't be a dumb logic if every other burst spec/class gets the same level of nerf. Then we'll have a leveled field and logic.<br />
<br />
And BG dominance? lol. The same Ret pally &quot;BG dominance&quot; we all can see changing the ret pally for any other damage class. I'm tired of seeing the same efficience with a arms warrior + healer combo, rogue + healer combo in BGs, also, ret pallies getting steamrolled by mages, fearspam locks (remember, trinket on 2min CD, bubble on 5min CD, if you're on a BG, the chances of having both of them on CD most of the time are very high)... If you're getting heals/cleanses and do good damage, you can really do some nice job. Paladins take the same damage they did before 3.0.2, they only now do damage instead of beeing melee healers or warriors wannabe that you could just skip and go.<br />
<br />
And just as a reminder: ppl can dispel pally's divine plea (wich would only grant you 25% of your mana after the buff expires). OOM - Cast Divine Plea - DP on CD now - Dispeled without granting you a single tick - /lolfreehonorkill</div></div><hr />

Except that it isn't the ret pally that will drain your mana. So, you can face a OOM ret pally without problems.<br />
<br />
Also, those classes have larger mana pools that can sustain 1500 mana drain per tick, so they won't be useless in only 5 secs.<br />
<br />
&quot;paladin can judge wisdom on me and recover mana!&quot;, OOM that won't happen, recovering small amount mana after each 3+ sec weapon swings (if the target didn't alread removed that or just don't let the ret hit him) is really sad.</div></div><hr />

<br />
you are of course right to some extent.<br />
and i also forgot about marvelous BoW which changes the numbers to 20.6% minimum return on JotW to not go oom.<br />
at the current 15% it's definately oom after 144secs (2min 22secs). that is with basic rotation.<br />
<br />
this normal rotation is already terribly limited in form of CDs (like u discribed it for DKs to be true) but also by a non-refillable resource (mana! like casters). where as other casters have means to refill mana at 70 (managems, innervate from someone, shadowfiend, evocation and so on) the paladin has non of his own, and the ones from raid members (innervate^^) are as usefull as a BoM for a priest...<br />
<br />
on the other hand: factoring in the (not yet available) divine plea on cd, our time to oom with minimum rotation goes up the something just short of 6mins (which is about the same as a mages was pre 3.0 (as i remember)).<br />
<br />
but it leaves no space what so ever for some extra burst or forgetting to judge every 8sec/using DP every minute.<br />
<br />
there are classes/specs with infinite/refreshing ressources like wl, dks, rogues, warriors, enh shamans (have never seen one of these oom with max rota...) and regarding those, i find it ridiculous to limit paladins by cs AND mana, with very very strongly limited ways to even that one.</div></div><hr />

Don't know if they've done another tourny since, but they've had one prior to the pally nerfs during 3.0.2 and only one team with a ret pally qualified for top 5 teams. Top qualifier team was still the old recognised classes.<br />
<br />
What I'm trying to say is that it might be easy getting above 1500 rating, but cutting edge is a different matter. How long does it take for a cutting edge player to adapt? Being &quot;ubar brutal&quot; doesn't mean you adapt fast, you know.</div></div><hr />

It makes sense that a team not experienced playing with a pally in the makeup would lose to teams experienced with their own makeup. As far as fighting against a ret pally goes, its not much different from fighting against the other heavy melee class in the past ... arms warriors... except that they have more health bars.</div></div><hr />

All this bullshit makes me happy I refused to roll a paladin in TBC. The majority of people who rolled paladin act like spoiled little children (probably due to the fact they are/were spoiled little children?). It's a game, you have given your consent to allow Blizzard to do what they (or Hacktivision, now) want to do, by paying your monthly &quot;subscription&quot; fee to the game and it's content.<br />
<br />
You cry about this, you cry about that. Just shut up and let the developers do what they want. Don't blame them individually. In case you didn't notice, Blizzard MERGED WITH ANOTHER COMPANY. The reason that they're pushing out changes before they're &quot;done&quot; (as they'd say), is for more profit. If you are unhappy, stop paying. Stop playing. Go do something else, but please, just stop your constant crybaby festival. If they over nerfed, they'll bring you back to speed.<br />
<br />
Stop being asshats because your class went from useless to useful. Know that you're always just one hotfix or server maintenance away from THE GROUND, baby.<br />
<br />
Enjoy your buff, grats, but please, can we talk about something else yet?</div></div><hr />

It might be because I have no pvp gear myself, since my retri gear is pve based, but non the less, I am looking forward to be ignored in BGs again and people will let me kill them. Cause now it's like &quot;Omg, a retri paladin. Quick, everyone kill him!&quot;. Not really much fun tbh. So I rather have lower damage and left along. Overall I will kill just as much, but I'll certainly die alot less. :P</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aikouka</div><div class="date">2008-10-28, 04:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I worked up some numbers using the new system and my Human Retadin's stats and here's what we got:<br />
<br />
Maximum Mana = 3918 mana (no bonus int from gear)<br />
Base Mana = 2953 (3918 - 965 provided by the 83 base intellect)<br />
<br />
This includes that you have Improved Judgments 2/2 and will be done over the course of 120 seconds:<br />
<br />
20 crusader strikes (8% BM per)<br />
12 divine storms (12% BM per)<br />
15 judgments (5% BM per... and yes, Blizzard... there's only one 'e' in judgment)<br />
<br />
Mana use:<br />
CS: 20 x 8% = 160%<br />
DS: 12 x 12% = 144%<br />
JoW: 15 x 5% = 75%<br />
--------------------<br />
379% = 11191.87 mana<br />
<br />
Mana return:<br />
JotW: 15 x 15% = 225%<br />
Repl: 12 x 2.5% = 30%<br />
----------------------<br />
255% = 7530.15 mana<br />
<br />
Adding in JoW:<br />
30 x 1% = 30%<br />
----------------<br />
30% (of Max Mana) = 1175.4 mana<br />
<br />
Note that the Judgment of Wisdom procs are considering a perfect one per four seconds, which probably will not occur.<br />
<br />
With that all said and done, you are able to regenerate 8705.55 mana over 120 seconds to compensate for 11191.87 mana spent. So you are spending mana at the rate of 93.27 per second and regenerating mana at 72.55 per second. So every second, you will have a loss of 20.72 mana<br />
<br />
Now, let's factor in the new Glyph of Crusader Strike, which lowers the mana cost by 20%, so it will cost 6.4% BM per strike.<br />
<br />
Mana difference:<br />
20 x 1.6% = 32%<br />
<br />
32% BM is 944.96 mana, so now we only spend 10246.91 mana over 120 seconds. Now, there's one more thing to consider for a proper 120 second rotation... recasting your seal as they only last for two minutes. I'll use Seal of Command for the example which costs 14% of base mana (or 413.42 mana). So now we're at 10660.33 mana over 120 seconds for a loss of 88.84 mana per second. So we're still losing 16.29 mana per second.<br />
<br />
So you either have two choices, go OOM in about 4 minutes or use Blessing of Wisdom, which will return 41 mana every 5 seconds, or 8.2 mana every second. That will just about double your longevity to 8 minutes. Now, this also is not perfect... like I said, the JoW return was considering perfect proc rate.<br />
<br />
To show another set of numbers, if you do not have Improved Judgments, you will only get 12 judgment procs off in the same amount of time and will amount to losing 11.07 mana per second off the regen. So you will now be at 61.48 mana per second regen.<br />
<br />
Overall Thoughts (for the TLDR crowd)<br />
<br />
- Using the new Glyph of Crusader Strike (-20% mana cost) will be important<br />
- Having Blessing of Wisdom on for long fights will be almost necessary.<br />
- You obviously need 2/2 Improved Judgments.<br />
- You will probably be able to last for around 3-4 minutes given 2/2 Improved Judgments, Judgment of Wisdom and Glyph of Crusader Strike if you only use Divine Storm, Crusader Strike, Seal of Command and Judgment of Wisdom. The numbers are not exact because technically, you cannot guarantee Replenishment will be on you 100% of the time in a 25 man raid and Judgment of Wisdom has a 4 second internal cooldown. You can probably double that time range if you use Blessing of Wisdom.<br />
<br />
PS. Let me know if the Judgment of Wisdom stuff is off... it may be even less than I mentioned. I may've gone off an old number for the 4 second internal cooldown.<br />
<br />

Silly me, it's 8.2 not 8.02 :P.</div></div><hr />

I can drain you, but I can also be drained. I have 6kmana. The only useful form of return is to A) go to AotV, which cuts my DPS in half and forces me to go 'on the run' until I can regain mana for awhile or B) FD and hope I can sit out the timer in arena (4+ seconds) to sit/drink a little.<br />
<br />
What in the hell is the difference from you guys?<br />
<br />
The only thing I can use while OOM is autofire or melee (which, atm, does not return mana).<br />
<br />
And yet you guys think because you have mana issues now you are...somehow...special? Or entitled to review?<br />
<br />
Face the facts: You guys facerolled your keyboards while /laugh(ing) at everyone. When people started posting that you should be initially reviewed you said 'QQ more noob, l2p.' Now you've been nerfed and the only thing I keep reading about paladins is OMG I HAVE TO SIT AND DRINK NOW.<br />
<br />
Welcome to more than a year of hunter issues in Pvp, Pve, and Arena (which is not like either of the two, and why I push it into its own category).<br />
<br />
Please stop with the posts about it -- return to the game and test it out for awhile. Get used to it before you start rampaging about how 'you were lied to' etc...<br />
<br />
Adapt or reroll, that's the only suggestions anyone at this point can offer.<br />
<br />
Above all else, stop speculating on returns until you've actually tried it.<br />

Killing a group of 4 people as 1 person not because of skill or lack of the other player's skill, but because of your current attention received and over-the-edge changes to make ret players want to play their class but hurt the other 8 is wrong. A frost mage has to actually manage his CC and timing to successfully 4vs1. A ret paladin runs in, hits 4 buttons, and walks out with 4 killing blows. No timing done. No skill done. A simple 1-2-3-4, tab, repeat rotation. Yes, there was a blooming spree of frost mages appearing everywhere before the patch, but not nearly as many ret paladins that have bloomed recently.<br />
<br />
When every paladin to exist that was once holy or prot has gone to ret with some PvE 2hander they managed to get their hands on and every player that enjoyed their class at one point, but is now playing that level 67 paladin they had rotting in their 5th character slot, there is a problem.<br />
<br />

<br />
one point worth mentioning: EVERY other class that can go oom, lasts longer with better gear, while pally will stay at this point for every, because we now use warri-gear.<br />
give some str2mp5 imbued in say crusader strike (which at the moment is a bit underwhelming) and we might see that we scale with gear ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, I mentioned that I have a 70 Retadin, but I also have a 70 BM Hunter and I can regen all of my mana in about 15-20 seconds while suffering negligible DPS loss (i.e. I barely notice it on Recount). <br />
<br />
I have a 70 of all classes but Druid right now (my druid is 65... got neglected when I went to play a DK on beta), and out of the classes/builds that I play, the ones I notice with the most mana issues are my mage (fire/IV build) and my enhancement Shaman (11/50/0). Now, the enhancement shaman is merely solo play and being able to keep up enough mana to use abilities in between Shamanistic Rage uses. I think the issue with Shamans is simply that Shamanistic Rage was designed to keep your mana up with only using shocks. He also has some issues, because most of his gear is leather, which is because of the poor mail itemization. Personally, I think it'd be nice to have a glyph that removed the 30% damage reduction, but shaved 25-50% off the cooldown. But I'm not complaining much, because Enhancement Shaman DPS took a huge jump from the changes :P.<br />
<br />
Well, the mage is definitely on fire... 'cause he's burning up his mana real quick :P. Using a mana gem and evocate, I can keep myself up for maybe 5 minutes. I'm thinking I may have to try timing the gems better to push that longer, but I know before the 3.0.2 patch, I used to pot often (as well as gem and evocate) and was actually spec'd Fire/Clearcast. I did do a little pvp on him and I didn't see so many mana issues with that, so I'll have to look again while doing some raiding. <br />
<br />
I should also note that I haven't tried my priest yet as I can't decide if I want to stay holy (went holy for TBC) or go back to shadow (what I was pre-BC). I did look at my Druid's mana use a bit as a Boomkin, but I can't really report much on it, because I was an idiot and thought I had a full caster set in the bank, but in reality I only had half a caster set :P. So I probably look a bit funny in half-feral, half-boomkin gear as my Druid was originally Feral. I changed him up mostly so he can level with my Death Knight (I play with 3 accounts) as two melee at once is awkward, but melee+caster combos work great.</div></div><hr />

I've thought about the free judgement system thru talents idea myself. Mana burns would in effect only reduce our utility and our dps would be spared, 3 mana burns and we can no longer support heal. To the people that suggest the Los tactic, at least you casters and can peek out and throw an instant or 2, a clever mana-burner will keep his distance from us because we'd be effectively cc ourselves by cowering behind pillars. My friend plays an Enhancement shammy so i know he can still use windfury, water shield is a free cast so he can at least keep up some dps (if he's not stunned/rooted/feared, poor bastard :P)</div></div><hr />

Your mana regeneration was halved, in my books it had to happen. You started with infinite mana, now your balanced, just purge the fucking vipersting off, so what if they made priests your anticlass. <br />
<br />
If I could run around with infinite mana, I'd be roflstomping everyone and not stopping, but I'd have the knowledge I'm overpowered. If I got nerfed I would realize I deserved it, I was ruining the game for other classes.<br />

I bet you could go about 3 minutes without BoW and finally go OOM. Like I said, I can't be sure about the JoW numbers as they could be wrong and that's ultimately best case scenario. Also, in a 25 man, you may not be getting replenishment all the time. So it may be closer to 2.5 minutes. Essentially, you do definitely need BoW on yourself and you could also factor in Mana Spring Totem (which even on my Enhancement Shaman, I use it all the time). You should be able to last for a full boss fight given all of those and maybe a pot.<br />
<br />
I could try some real-world tests when the patch finally comes out, but my Retadin isn't exactly that geared (he was my last guy to get 70), so other players might be better suited.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Also you can spell either judgement or Judgment this word goes both ways<br />
<br />
It must be some silly British thing or something :P. I've always been accosted by spell checkers when I used &quot;judgement&quot; (even Firefox throws the squigglies under it!)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wait.. What?<br />
If 4 people can't kill 1 Retri paladin, then they obviously suck.<br />
I've been pvping alot lately and 4 people is more then enough to nuke the shit out of me before even killing 1.<br />
<br />
Unlike you're trying to say, this is obviously a L2P issue. You know a retri paladin have the Divine Storm whirlwind attack. Maybe you shouldn't huddle the fuck up? Would you huddle up in a crowd against a Bladestorm warrior? If your answer is yes, then just go and L2P please.<br />
<br />
Yes, I admit retri paladins now is overpowered, but your example is just way out there. So unless it was 4 mages huddled up, afk and Spellfire/Spellstrike geared, your statement is indeed false.</div></div><hr />

We think you can go almost indefinetely on mana by using Divine Storm, Crusader Strike and a Seal / Judgement. If you want to add things to that, Consecration, Hammer or a heal perhaps, your mana will start to dip, but Divine Plea should make up for that. In PvP, you can make the choice to blow all of your mana knowing that you have time before the next fight to build your reserves back up. Or if you want to go from target to target with no downtime, don't blow all of your mana.<br />
so... they want us to use only 3 spells in our dps rotation...sad<br />

I think the point is not the fact of spamming 3 buttons but the fact that spamming just those three buttons will dramatically reduce our damage, there's not much point in being ret if you can't at least have a chance to top the charts imo, same goes for any class... they should all have a fair shot at topping the charts...<br />
personally I have a pally that I've been stuck playing as prot for almost 3 years, I thought we might get a chance to dps the odd raid, now it look like blizz has other ideas, oh well I should have seen it coming I guess, and poor locks went from being top of the meters to being at the most 5th or 6th with ppl of equal gear, like warriors / huntards / mages... I also have a SP which I have always felt bad for they can't keep up, regardless of gear.<br />
Oh well blizz says their trying to lvl out damage, but I personally don't see it... It's still as messed up as ever, equally geared ppl of diff classes theirs gaps of 500 - 800 dps depending on class.. which is just wrong, for example SP vs Huntard. Hunters are over 2k for most boss fights, and equally geared SP's are 11-1200 .. oh well I guess I should have rolled a hunter or a mage.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fermi</div><div class="date">2008-10-28, 06:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">All mana users have to manage their mana consumption. This means limited use of AoE and high mana cost spells in PVE and a useful lifetime in PVP based on mana remaining. ALL mana classes can be countered by mana draining in Arena. These are fundamental aspect of mana classes and I don't see the devs changing these just for pallies.<br />
<br />
A legimate complaint for both ret/prot pallies and hunters is that there gear only has stamina, strength and agility which leads to a mana pool of 6000-7000 compared to 10000-15000 for other casters who can stack intellect. This leaves the low intellect classes very susceptible to mana drains in PVP and going oom more quickly in PVE than other mana users. <br />
<br />
Normal mana regen works based on intellect and spirit, stats which hunters and pallies lack. Also the new mana replenishment buffs return mana based of a percentage of total mana, so these players are getting a much lower regen rate compared to a priest or mage. Blizz tried to counter these issues with new mana regen abilities (Aspect of the Viper and Judgement of Wisdom) however if they are powerful enough to be useful in PVE then they are way overpowered in PVP.<br />
<br />
What both hunters and pallies need is a talent to convert their other stats (stam/str/agi) into mana in order to enlarge their mana pool to something more comparable to other casters.</div></div><hr />

Jeesh we dont even have enough mana to keep up the 3 button spam we need Judgement DS and Crusaderstrike to do any damage atm with the mana Overnerfed a bit we cant even pull that off they should have nerfed it to regain 20% mana instead of just throwing it from 33% to 15% thats overkill to me =P and as we dont have anyother way to regain mana then judgement of the wise this sucks even with my mage i am able to keep mana up for like 10 minutes easy</div></div><hr />

<br />
What, then, will you have us do in raids? Pick flowers? We can't heal well with so little mana and untalented heals. We can't tank because we talented and geared for two-hander dps. What, then, would you have us do? The fact of the matter is that ret is THE DPS tree. I doubt any of us picked this build so that we could regularly throw healing gear on and heal, or slap a shield on and tank. We rolled ret the same reason you roll a rogue, warrior, feral druid or enhancement shaman -- to melee! <br />
<br />
Trees aside, what makes a class a hybrid? Just because the paladin tree is so vastly different in comparison to the trees of other classes, this makes them a hybrid? Just like you, we don't have the points to enjoy the gifts of all three trees to an extent that makes us even mediocre at all three at the same time. <br />
<br />
Are mages a hybrid class? Like paladins, mages have to choose. Why for so long was frost less desirable in raids than fire, and vice versa? <br />
<br />
Again, I ask you, what does it mean to be a hybrid? To bring many things to the table? Most people love my mage for the cc and the snacks. Last time I checked, rogues had a nice cc. Etc., etc., etc. No class is &quot;pure&quot; anything. We all have tools. Just because ret paladins can very rarely heal does not make them this do-all class. I would gladly give up my ability to heal at all for the sustained and burst dps of other classes. <br />
<br />
If we were so uber-hybrid, we would have been well-represented in raids and in arenas. We weren't, and it looks like this will remain the same. <br />
<br />
Perhaps the only &quot;pure dps&quot; class is a warrior, and you didn't even list them. And even then, this is but just one, maybe two, of their trees. <br />
<br />
In a nutshell, the &quot;paladin is a hybrid, therefore should not do high dps&quot; argument is almost as old as the &quot;paladin is just a healer&quot; argument. The game and the makeup of each class is much too complex. <br />
<br />
I will close, however, in agreement that with the last patch, all the a-hole ret paladins came out in droves. It was by far the most embarrassing and frustrating couple of weeks I can remember. I will be glad that the nerfs send many of them packing...I just hope it doesn't force those of us who enjoy playing packing as well, simply because we were not given the basic tools needed to play at all. Only time will tell, I suppose.</div></div><hr />

point of this is the word &quot;enough&quot;<br />
You definitely do &quot;enough&quot; dps to be a dps class, but where ret pally stands right now is no where near &quot;enough&quot;. Hence OP.<br />
<br />
Perhaps the shouldn't mess with the mana usage, but instead reduce the damage and increase the cooldowns of spells that stuns opponents. Perhaps then it would be fair for both sides.<br />
<br />
Mail wearing shaman with 12K health and over 420 res getting 2~3 shotted by ret pally while stunned is the reality of today.</div></div><hr />

Yes, but you will have your pie tomorrow. I would say it was fun while it lasted, but it wasn't. It brought out the worst in everyone, paladins included. I just wish they would have picked one area to nerf, damage or mana, not both. I know you, as a shaman, can relate.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Guillaume</div><div class="date">2008-10-28, 09:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I say nerf us to the ground as much as you feel is necessary. The true test will be what happens at level 80. Will there be ret pallies in raids/PVE vs. other dps classes? Will we be more represented in winning arena teams? How will we compare in BG in terms of honor gained? I think of ret as a dps spec so we should compare ourselves to dps specs from other classes. We will see.<br />
<br />
At level 70 what class needed a nerf as far as heals? DPS? I don't think there are any tanks we can compare realistically in all areas of PVE/arena/BG so lets keep that off the table. If there are classes/specs that were uberpowerful at 70 why didn't they get nerfed?<br />
<br />
So what are the overrepresented classes in arena for heals and DPS? In raids/PVE? or in BG (I don't think this applies, but someone make the case. I mean pallies are facerolling right?)? Aren't there other considerations besides DPS in arena/PVP vs raids/PVE?<br />
<br />
To all the pallies, just chill. Hey at least leveling to 80 will be a lot easier.<br />
<br />
On another note, I would just like to have some kind of charge/sprint skill like all the other melee classes. I mean running faster overall is nice, but getting to your target asap is better. Is that too much to ask for? I mean pallies (knights) do kill stuff right? ;)</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Capoldriahn</div><div class="date">2008-10-28, 11:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I notice alot of people bringing up the &quot;But you are a hybrid class, you are not suppose to do dps as good as the pure dps classes.&quot; argument. Ok, that's fine. Let's apply this logic to the hybrid class.<br />
We all agree that you must be able to do the different tasks either equally good or equally bad in order to warrent the term hybrid class. With this logic in mind, it means they need to make every other task (in the paladins case, tanking and healing) just as good or bad as their ability to damage. A hybrid class is a jack of all trades and a master of none.<br />
<br />
So, what do you suggest Blizzard do? Keep the hybrid term and as a result making the paladin equally good at doing damage as it is at healing or tanking? Or do you suggest Blizzard make pure healing and pure tanking classes and removes the term hybrid class all together?<br />
<br />
Even though I can speak only for myself and not the entire WoW community, I have a pretty strong feeling the latter option is out of the question. So that pretty much leaves us with making the paladin equally good at doing dps, healing and tanking. If you don't want them to be able to do good damage, you don't want them to heal good nor tank good either. And pay attention to the word good damage. I'm not saying retri paladins should be #1 on the dps meters (maybe with the exception of in Nax, given the fact paladins are anti-undead/demons) but it should be competable on the damage meters, just as the holy paladins are on the healing meters. All three roles should be on the same line of performance in order to be a hybrid class.</div></div><hr />

I swear i have to bang my head against the wall every time someone uses the hybrid argument to justify lowering our dps. If blizz had been successful with the hybrid idea then that would be true but everyone knows they screwed up, so now we're just 1 class with 3 wildly different trees forced to spec deep into 1 tree to be viable. oh and i have a pair of balls thank you and i know the spec was overpowered and unfair but damn good fun while it lasted, kinda made up for all the time i was stunlocked by rogues raped silly :)</div></div><hr />

Actually i just toss on a healing weapon and heal with about 1.3k SP ret raid buffed so toss that with wrath 10k holy lights with a very decent hot, judgment of wisdom and keep attacking with the faster 1h+sheild more mana back judgment more mana then u loose and still put out the dps. With gavel of light i can still pull 1k dps and heal. Maybe im just good but playin ret pre patch sets u up for versatility because of having to play very mana conscience.
