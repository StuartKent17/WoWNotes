<br />
Seems the orange stuff that covers that covers whole floor periodically hurts the whole raid, but the stuff very slowly diminishes away and will do less damage the more it diminishes. When it gets renewed it will do more damage than the previous one. This means this acts as a soft enrage timer. You must kill the boss before the orange stuff starts to hurt the whole raid too much.<br />
<br />
Occasionally a few random players will vomit and it seems they lose control of their character for a moment when that happens. I guess it is recommended for nearby players to get away from players that vomit.<br />
<br />
I noticed Festergut would sometimes increase in size. Some kind of self buff that increases damage probably.</div></div><hr />

First of all, love the Achewood avatar.<br />

Second of all, I totally agree. They're still balancing Festergut, he's not even on hardmode... Don't you think it's a little snotty and presumptuous to be dissing him so early? Doing a 25man normal mode boss who's only been on the PTR for like 20 seconds and then declaring that Sunwell is a REAL instance so they're gonna go do that instead is just... rude.</div></div><hr />

And periodically, Festergut inhales the cloud, removing it and giving him his Inhale Blight buff. While he has it, presumably he releases those Gas Spores, which deal damage but protect players from the blight cloud. The 'Pungent Blight' spell is probably what happens when he exhales the cloud, and the various levels of 'Gaseous Blight' show that the blight cloud does more and more damage every time he exhales it.<br />
<br />
Actually sounds pretty fun.</div></div><hr />

No, they can't be serious...<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh well they might just make a raid instance with 5 bosses, each having the model of a worg at 500% scaling. They would name that instance Worg Citadel and simply name the bosses Worg1-Worg4- The endboss would be ,,the worgs of northrend&quot; and it wouldn't be one, but TWO northrend worgs!!!<br />

Just as an FYI to those watching, one of his abilities was working completely incorrectly. When he exhales all the gas he inhaled 3 times over, it's supposed to do a base 50k shadow damage to the entire raid. The Gas Spore people he marks occasionally throughout the fight explode, but give a buff to everyone they hit that reduces the damage of that 50k explosion significantly per stack. Basically you want to balance people needing more mitigation, but not exploding the entire raid every time. <br />
<br />
It's supposed to be a dichotomy of spreading out to avoid the Vile Gas and not having 5 people explode everyone every time, and getting all 25 people the necessary stacks of mitigation to survive every &quot;50k&quot; Pungent Blight.<br />
<br />
The way the fight was on this test, it was bugged and everyone had lots of mitigation all the time. With shields on the entire raid we never even took damage from Pungent Blight, which is a huge mechanic to the encounter.<br />
<br />
So yes, of course it seemed like a pushover. I can't wait to see how punishing it will be on Hardmode. The Sunwell comment was more directed to this entire expansion of casual raiding, and was largely a joke. This is the internet, lighten up about it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
To be fair, ICC seems to have the wings follow the DK trees, that being blood/frost/unholy, so it is to be expected. I can however understand the feeling of &quot;not this again&quot;, however, this is more akin to a mix of plague/abomination wing combined into one, and lacking the military/spider wings of naxx.<br />
<br />
Also, I laughed at: not one, but TWO northrend worgs!</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Silarn</div><div class="date">2009-10-22, 02:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The spores are released throughout the fight.<br />
<br />
You need to spread out to avoid the Vile Gas casts, which can be quite bad if you're very clumped up.<br />
<br />
However, when people are targeted with the spores, you must quickly run to them and take the damage from the spores, as this will build up a stacking &quot;Inoculation&quot; debuff, which reduces shadow damage by 25% per stack.<br />
<br />
Festergut will inhale the gas in the room three times (reducing it's damage per inhale) until it's completely inhaled, then he will exhale (Pungent Blight) for massive shadow damage. If you have enough Inoculation stacks you will survive this damage. If you do not, you will die.<br />
<br />
But supposedly the Pungent Blight is bugged and not doing enough damage.</div></div><hr />
