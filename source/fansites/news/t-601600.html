Expansion

Expansion<br />
Nop, I'm still not accepting fake posts about the expansion on the forums. A lot of sites will be posting anything they can find in the next days to see their traffic boosted anyway. <br />
The last post was about someone getting banned for saying that the expansion is the Undermine. Which is pretty stupid because you could get banned by saying that the expansion is Northrend or anything else, you could probably get banned for saying that the next expansion has Harry Potter in it.<br />
<br />
The expansion will be Northrend, there isn't anything you can do about it. <br />
<br />
Update : Almost forgot, no, the fact that someone out of nowhere claims that he got a sheet music with Northrend written on it isn't a proof. Actually I doubt that Blizzard needs to add the name of the song at the end of each sheet to have it played.</div></div><hr />

i dont hope that tbh, ppl who are working hard on their education plus having a job in irl cant make them go hardcore in pve.. i think that they should up the price on some items instead maybe, im saying that since, the ppl in 2400 bracket gets all of the items within 3-4 weeks (:</div></div><hr />

The best PvE items should come from PvE.<br />
<br />
Perhaps there is an issue with the availability of the PvP epics to &quot;bad players&quot;, but PvE gear should never outstrip PvP gear for PvP.<br />
<br />
The system Blizzard has now works very well and the only people who don't like it are the nostalgic few who still expect to walk into the arena or BGs with their PvE Tier X armour/weapons and walk all over everyone who doesn't raid also.<br />
<br />
And before you say it, yes I was one of those hardcore PvEers back pre-BC, 20th EU kill on Kel'Thuzad.. the system in place is much better than pre-BC.</div></div><hr />

The best PvE items should come from PvE.<br />
<br />
In a perfect world...<br />
<br />
But as for now, PvE is much harder than PvP.<br />
- you need 24+ other skilled people instead of 1-4+ (ok avarange skill probably is higher for PvP but still easier to get 4+ very skilled players than 24+ skilled players)<br />
- you need consumables<br />
- you have bigger repair bills<br />
- PvE is much more time consuming, especially as &quot;one go&quot;, you cannot really take break for 4-5 hours while you can anytime with PvP<br />
- PvE contains much more drama<br />
- PvP loot is predictable while PvE loot is dkp and loot table both luck based (dkp = selections/need of certain class for different encounter, number of that class in guild etc.)<br />
<br />
Truth is game can be based on PvP OR PvE, it is impossible to be good at both. And everyone knows that WoW is PvE game with PvP elements. If you want PvP game wait for WAR.<br />
<br />
Problem I see with PvP at the moment is that newcomers with honor gear are fucked in arena and something should be done maybe about that.<br />
<br />
Anyhow this is topic about expansion and comic what the hell... :D<br />
<br />
I wonder if they really put something NEW into next exp. And I mean NEW. Not some new zones with some quests, some more mobs, some more items... its all old. I mean NPC for instances (when you can't find this damn tank/healer, especially when leveling alt), review of 20-58 leveling, proper heroic 5 mans (not &quot;lets increase all stats by 100%! ok heroics done!&quot;) etc. I DEMAND SOMETHING NEW! And for the love of God... I hope they will not release it unfinished like they did with TBC.</div></div><hr />

Personally the biggest problem I see with Arena right now is the huge barrier to entry. Gear does play a huge factor in winning or losing in arena and right now the only way to get the good gear is to win, which you can't really do without good gear. This means that practically speaking you can no longer gear up to start arena without doing PvE content. A warrior in lvl 70 blue gear for example does about 60% of the damage, has 60% of the health and 60% of the armor of a warrior in top end gladiator gear (and probably much less resillience) and I am sure other classes are roughly the same situation. If you want to break into that you have to go raiding to get good gear to allow you to compete in PvP.<br />
<br />
Right now, arena ranking is basically a self sustaining system. If you have a high ranking you are going to get better gear faster making it easier for you to keep that high ranking. <br />
Maybe when they introduce season 3 arena they will make the season 1 stuff the new bg pvp rewards.</div></div><hr />

LOL, Warcraft music isn't even played by live musicians. There's a program that plays it back (probably like Sibelius). There's not even a need to print it out.</div></div><hr />

Did you forget what an expansion is? You're asking them to completely revamp their game? I can see where you're coming from but sounds to me like you're asking for a new game ;)</div></div><hr />

Um in heroics bosses get new abilities and revamped old ones, spawns get changed, and events are different, TBC was finished on release, they didn't plan on Hyjal/Illidan being done by release, they had already said this previously.<br />
<br />
I do wish Sunwell Plateau would be added though =(</div></div><hr />

-new continent<br />
-hero classes (they were supposed to come in a patch a few months after the released, or at least that's what blizz said during the beta... yes I've been around for that long, sadly enough)<br />
-Heroic mode for old instances (Including raids like MC/BWL/AQ20 and 40/Naxx, and heck, even UBRS if that counts as a 10man raid....), admit it, you'd all love to do Deadmines in heroic ;-) Just once at least, I know i'd love to run Scholo over and over again :-)</div></div><hr />

Sadly you're forgetting something. BGs, you can still gather enough stamina and good overall stats to begin your arena journey :]</div></div><hr />
