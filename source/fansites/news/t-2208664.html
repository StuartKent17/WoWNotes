Kirin Tor Quests and Flying Mounts<br />
We haven't decided whether or not we'll make any changes to restrict flying on the Kirin Tor World Quests. We did anticipate they would become a lot easier with flying and, as such, we have no intention of taking action against players who use flying to easily complete these World Quests in their current state.

And the tag-limit on those mobs was pretty bad. Farmed about 15-20 minutes for a handful of marks, joined a group on the tool which helped a bit. Then a Lieutenant spawned and I got nearly half the marks without effort. Very well balanced.</div></div><hr />

Add a buff that falls of if mounted that would add an extra ap item or order resources.

It saves time and makes some things easier. So when people use flying to make KT WQs easier and quicker, they are thinking if they should restrict it. I must say I was a bit &quot;WTF?&quot; when I saw first people zoom past me on their fliers towards top of Thunder Totem. Last night, after unlocking flying myself, I grinned as I passed a few people in the bubbles. Almost stopped to wave. Now, sure, it does make the quests sort of &quot;trivial&quot;, but besides that, it's not like they are difficult in the first place? You just fly at a snails pace in a bubble, instead of your mount.</div></div><hr />

Not the same thing. Kirin Tor quests were designed differently than normal quest. Flying is just like raid marking the barrels, kills the purpose of the quest. This must be hot fixed.</div></div><hr />

What about Stormhein ? You need the harpoon to go some places, not anymore with flying. There is even one (don't remember if more) WQ that you need the harpoon (nests WQ) to do it, but now you don't. Isn't it the same thing? It's not like you can do barrel or puzzle Kirin'Tor WQ too just by flying.</div></div><hr />

Meh, the Kirin Tor quests have been buggy messes since they launched. When they stop resetting for no apparent reason, I will stop flying to do them. And stop acting like you are being personally attacked by people being able to fly, if you don't fly for it, DON'T FLY FOR IT. No need to throw a hissy fit because other people do.<br />

Before flying was in, I actually wondered if flying during the Kirin Tor world quests was going to be disabled out of the gate, since it essentially negates the quests. I was kind of surprised it wasn't, to be honest - imposing stupid limitations like that to something inconsequential like a world quest seems to be their M.O. sometimes.

<br />
Exactly, I wouldn't mind the quests so much if they had been designed halfway decently. But it frequently resets itself, or stops your dash early, or ignores you passing through a bubble.<br />
