One of the most interesting armory update is here, I announced it a couple of weeks ago and it is now live on the US armory site and will be available shortly on the EU one. Here is what you can get on any armory profile (http://www.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Executus&amp;cn=Vulturex)<br />
<br />
3D Model Viewer<br />
Every character profile now has a 3D model viewer that displays the character in his or her currently equipped gear, and accurately displays the character's physical features, hairstyle, and helm/cloak display as they appear in-game. Mousing over the character model window brings up a control panel with the following controls :<br />
<br />
Camera controls: To rotate the camera around a character, click and hold the left mouse button while moving the mouse left and right, or click the arrow buttons in the top left of the window. To zoom in and out, use the mouse wheel while hovering over the character window, or click the zoom buttons in the top left of the window. To move the character within the frame, right-click and drag the character in the window (or on the small square in the bottom left corner of the window).<br />
Animations: Each character has a selection of animations that they can perform. Use the arrows next to the animation's name to cycle through them. The available animations are determined by the character's class and currently equipped weapons.<br />
Capture pose: If you are logged in, you can set the default pose of any character on your account. Use the camera and animation controls to create a pose, then click the save icon to set it as the default. All visitors to the character's profile will then see the character in that pose.<br />
Play controls: The rewind, pause, and fast forward buttons allow you to fine-tune a pose for a character.<br />
Fullscreen mode: You can view the character in a fullscreen display against a selection of backgrounds. All controls will continue to function in fullscreen mode.<br />
Embed: You can embed a standalone, interactive version of the character's model viewer in a compatible website, such as a social networking site, guild website, or forum.<br />
Options: Extra options include selecting a background in fullscreen mode and toggling the display of a character's helm, cloak, or tabard.<br />

<br />
Character and Calendar Feeds<br />
You can export your character information and calendar events to other websites and applications using the Armory's new customization tools. These features can be accessed through a logged-in character profile or through the Armory's main navigation menu.<br />
<br />
Character Activity Feeds: Each character's activity feed shows the most recent in-game actions of the character that can be recorded by the Armory. These include achievements, boss kills, item acquisitions, and more. Character feeds can be customized using our customization tool, then exported as RSS feeds to your RSS reader of choice. Refer to the Character Feed FAQ for more details.<br />
Player Calendar Feeds: Another new Armory tool allows you to export in-game player calendar data to online calendars such as Google Calendar. The tool can aggregate up to five characters on your account in a single feed, and is automatically synched with the characters' in-game player calendars. Refer to the Calendar Feed FAQ for more details.<br />

Professor Putricide &quot;buff&quot;<br />
As a point of clarification, this was not a buff so much as a bug fix. The AEs being cast by the abomination driver in P1, P2 and the tanks in P3 were being affected by the player AE cap, thus diminishing the amount of raid damage being done in 25 player Putricide. We fixed that bug in a hotfix. Of course we waited until Tuesday's server maintenance to apply the hotfix so as not to unfairly punish people that raided later in the week.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, the encounter was designed to utilize 3 tanks. If you're just barely making the DPS check killing Putricide with 2 tanks, you might have a problem. Essentially, if you're using 2 tanks and both tanks are at a 4 stack your raid should be dead. With that said, I have a hard time believing a guild capable of meeting the DPS requirement for Festergut can't make a substitution in their raid comp to overcome the bug fix.<br />
<br />
If all else fails, zonewide buffs will be available soon enough, allowing you to crush Professor Putricide, see his oozes driven before you, and hear the lamentation of his abominations. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/12/22418976253-stealth-buffing-p3-put-is-kind-of-a--move.html))<br />
<br />
Burst damage in PvP<br />
We think everything is a little too intense right now, almost like playing the game on fast forward. Yes, damage can come in too quickly, but that is partially because healing is also so huge that without some amount of burst, it would seem as though nobody would ever die. It's as if players are either at 100% health or 0% health, and very infrequently effective in between. If we just drastically toned down PvP damage across the board -- say, by inflating resilience or health pools -- then healers would dominate, much as was the case in The Burning Crusade. In return, the only way to win a match would be to chain crowd control or possibly mana drain the healer. We certainly want to make sure these abilities have their place in PvP, but the game can also be frustrating when excessive healing gives players the feeling that fights are just being reset consistently until healers are completely out of mana (which in most cases can take a very long time).<br />
<br />
On the flip side, we could tone down damage and healing, but that has huge PvE ramifications and we're not ready to re-balance the entire game -- though this is the intent for Cataclysm. What we'll likely do for the next expansion is ramp damage up a little as players advance, but have health pools increase greatly and healing increase by marginal amounts. The same change would have benefits for PvE too because mana then becomes a consideration for healers -- they must make a more determined choice between an efficient strategy and a spamming strategy -- and tanks won't constantly face dying by two unfortunate strikes. In PvP, you'll ideally see more players in a wounded state, and they can eventually be worn down rather than blown up in a couple of global cooldowns.

<br />
Resilience in next season<br />
We are discussing the idea of increasing the benefits of resilience for the next Arena season. We will have to see what effect this has on healing and whether or not weapon inflation from the newest items can adequately offset any of those effects.

I have a boombastic computer at home but im sure at other places checking a simple thing on the armory might take a damn long while to load etc because of the 3D model.<br />
In general i think it is cool that you can view other chars like that, but I don't think it was something &quot;necessary&quot; to add to the armory imo. Oh well... :P 3/5</div></div><hr />

In PvP, you'll ideally see more players in a wounded state, and they can eventually be worn down rather than blown up in a couple of global cooldowns.

Resilience in next season<br />
We are discussing the idea of increasing the benefits of resilience for the next Arena season. We will have to see what effect this has on healing and whether or not weapon inflation from the newest items can adequately offset any of those effects. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/22418747203-how-did-burst-get-so-high.html))<br />
<br />
<br />
I can't wait until Cataclysm. From what i hear the implementation of new talent trees will incooporate &quot;fine tune&quot; talents that act like &quot;knobs&quot; to turn (as quoted by Ghostcrawler) so that tuning this one talent allows them to balance the whole tree without creating an avalanche effect that destroys the balance of all other talents and abilities.<br />
<br />
I would imaginne each class has a &quot;hidden talent&quot; that becomes mandatory to select for PvE and another one to be mandatory to select for PvP. (think Hunger for Blood in the rogue tree that is a 51 point PvE talent that increases overall damage on a flat scale which can easily be adjusted to affect overall damage without hurting any other talent in the rogue tree and not at all affecting PvP).<br />
<br />
So each class in effect has 1 mandatory PvP talent and 1 mandatory PvE talent (not mandatory in that Blizzard enforces you to select this ability, but mandatory in that if you wish to perform well in either PvP or PvE you will need to pick this one particular talent) possibly 1 of each in each tree of talents.<br />
<br />
If i have understood the idea that Ghostcrawler explained about talents working in this way (and im probably not fully correct, but the idea i believe to be correct at least), then this means that PvP balancing will be much, much easier to maintain without ever affecting PvE.<br />
<br />
This is amazing.<br />
<br />
It won't create headaches for developrs, it will put alot of forum whining to rest, and PvE players wont whine at arena because any changes made to the PvP aspects of a class won't affect PvE, and vice versa.<br />
<br />
Balace in Cataclsym will therefore feel more &quot;complete&quot;, and hopefully will also allow Blizzard to implement new thing like more raid content, more arenas, more bg's etc, instead of spending all their time balanceing class abilites (which is certainly what it feels like at the moment).<br />
<br />
If you can achieve this Blizzard, you will have so much of a better game. Roll on Cataclysm please, the game sets to look phenominal. Just don't slack on satisfying content for us and we will love you for it :-*</div></div><hr />

<br />
When Arthas is available, Tirion Fordring and the Argent Crusade will provide a Buff to all players in Icecrown (Zone, Raid and Dungeons).<br />
<br />
It will be something like 5% more HP, DPS and Healing... although don't quote me on that exactly.<br />
<br />
It is to allow people struggling on the previous bosses to have that little extra help to catch up to Arthas.<br />
<br />
Arthas is tuned to ONLY be killable WITH the Buff... so people shouldn't complain saying &quot;ARTHAS WILL BE TOO EASY WITH THIS BUFF FFFFFFZZZZZSSDXXXXX CASUALS!&quot;.<br />
<br />
Hard Modes will still get the Buff... the encounters will just be made harder.</div></div><hr />

This is a bad explanation.<br />
<br />
The explanation we've been given is that once ICC has been out for a while we'll start receiving a buff (similar to the one you get in a LFG heroic now). This buff will get stronger over the weeks and months towards Cataclysm so everyone should be able to get through eventually. <br />
<br />
Mechanically it is a more pallatable way for them to make encounters easier over time. In game terms in is supposed to represent the turning tide of the war as the argent crusade grow in strength.</div></div><hr />

Ah nice and interesting choise for Blizz to make the encounters weaker over time, and in this way Blizz can please hardcores and casuals - by the time the casuals can see the encounters/lorewise, the hardcores can struggle with the achi runs/hc runs/next raiding instance.<br />
<br />
For me this is one of the greatest news about the PVE aspect of the game because the chances to see and fight/kill all the encounters counts very much for the lore and the story of my char.<br />
<br />
Also, love the armory upgrades, wonder how will it work in the future and how slow/fast will the website will be.<br />
<br />
I am interested only in those character Rss updates, would like to see some examples and also would like to see if I can subscribe to someones char updates with my Greader!<br />

One further clarification, you are able to &quot;opt-out&quot; of the buff, according to the original information on it, should you wish to run ICC without it.</div></div><hr />

Second of all, for all the people complaining that the armory is freaking slow and moaning about it. I suggest that you change the browser, I just tested the loading time in three different browsers. Google Chrome, Safari and Internet Explorer. I don't have Firefox installed but I would think that it would have similar if not almost as good as Chrome or Safari.<br />
<br />
Internet Explorer has the longest loading time by far of all three browsers I tested. In the range of 3-4 times as long and it runs more choppy as well. Change your browser instead of blaming the department who made the sight, it's not exactly news that IE is slow and sucky regarding performance.</div></div><hr />

too much unnecessary information on the screen, and things what should be relevant are so small that you can barley see it. <br />
<br />
take a tank, the health number is not well placed at all, same with mana with a healer. <br />
<br />
also, I was expecting an average gear ilvl, but I guess not.<br />
<br />
basically, it makes a big splash of irrelevant things, while useful info are harder to see. <br />
<br />
IF you could customize it for each of your toon, like you do with a signature, then it would be nice. as it is now, it's just pure shit. <br />

<br />
its simply smoother. only problem is ofc that wowheads modelviewer is fetching the infomation FROM armory and therefor is useless if armory should be down.<br />
<br />
also with wowheads modelviewer there is no limitation so you can style it as u want, fx i used it on my own guild's homepage (http://pekish.eu/members/ if any wants to see it in action, click the 3D button).<br />
<br />
however the armory is loading alot faster, but for those people with slow connections it would be nice if the modelviewer was an option instead.</div></div><hr />
