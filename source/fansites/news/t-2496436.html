Its been a 'Saturday morning cartoon' for years and years and years. But heres the thing. Saturday morning cartoons are fun. Chill out. If you are still playing WoW and still expecting advanced/quality storytelling, you are fooling yourself. <br />
At this point that cinematic really ought not have surprised anyone, and if you weren't prepared for exactly this sort of 'NEXT WEEK ON WOW' clip have just not been paying attention. <br />
Stop expecting depth where there isn't any. Its just going to keep your blood pressure up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Looked to me like she died and either an old god or void lord is taking her away to punish or consumer her. Some ppl say she looked shocked, but to me she looked terrified.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Gotta agree with you on that one, I thought it was pretty obvious that she was being basically rezzed and dragged off for punishment, and she knew it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Her major job was to release n'zoth - and that was completed.<br />
<br />
Actually she died/fainted just to complete that job..... if anything she will be rewarded, probably with some old-world eldrich mutation powers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I guess it depends on how you look at the old gods. It is entirely possible that punishment/reward aren't all that far apart. Lady Ashvane was rewarded for her troubles and that didn't seem so great. <br />
She certainly didn't have the look of someone being whisked away to anything good.</div></div><hr />

&quot;He&quot; hates her though. She forced his hand from day one, and has since spent 10k years going as slowly as possible and mocking him the entire time. <br />

Well she Xal the entity I'm sure will reappear but since the dagger was on the ship in Nathanos' possession when the zone opened and Nathanos is seen later without it I guessed it would pop up here.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard has shown to have cinematics and story updates come out any time during patches in BFA. There's obviously more specifics to come, and they will when it makes sense. Would it make sense if N'zoth was 100% fully released right there in the background of Jaina and Lorthremar, but then we chilled and did dailies for 4 months? This is all we needed right now.<br />
<br />
When we killed KJ, and the portal between Argus and Azeroth was opened, did we get ARGUS THE UNMAKER spelled out for us? No.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MasterDinadan</div><div class="date">2019-07-10, 03:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I haven't played WoW in a bit but...<br />
<br />
N'Zoth is &quot;resurrecting&quot; Azshara and saying &quot;All eyes shall be opened.&quot; Does it mean N'Zoth will resurrect ALL of the dead? Effectively a new Scourge? (Also consistent with the effect of N'Zoth in Hearthstone, not that anything there is canon but still)<br />
<br />
If so then perhaps Sylvanas will be the key to freeing the N'Zoth undead from their servitude just as she freed the Forsaken from the Lich King, which would vindicate her somewhat (in her view at least, she's trying to protect the interests of the Forsaken. If we find that the dead are truly the greatest threat to Azeroth, then her power over the dead may be what saves Azeroth)<br />
<br />
And it may explain the weird happenings with Bolvar, Bwonsamdi, whatever else, if N'Zoth has been claiming the &quot;souls&quot; of the dead.<br />
<br />
But like I said I haven't played WoW in a bit so some of this may already be proven untrue.<br />
<br />
I do feel like there has been way too much focus on death as a theme lately for this to just be a throwaway line though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Isn't N'zoth the most powerful Old God when you put it into relative terms? C'thun and Yogg'Saron were both recovering and trying to build their power up (Rather quickly). N'zoth has been trapped for 10k years and that's well over the time what the other Old Gods had time to do. He'll probably be a Gul'dan of sorts and open the way for a new expansion.</div></div><hr />

Some ppl say she looked shocked, but to me she looked terrified.<br />
<br />
I think so too. It reminded me a lot of the end of Sleepy Hollow, (spoilers) when the monster takes that evil lady into tree-hell.<br />
<br />
I also think that the next time we see her, how different she is is going to say a LOT about N'zoth to a playerbase that doesn't really know him all that well. Since we kind of know how Azshara is personality wise, and how her boss fight was, if she's really messed up, out of character, and maybe thanks us for finishing her off like the coven-bewitched mobs in Drustvar, it could hype N'zoth a lot for next expac (assuming thats whats going down).<br />
<br />
I also think he'll eventually go to all the other world leaders and try to offer them 'deals'.</div></div><hr />

Well, we don't know for sure who it is, but I'm definitely leaning towards Void Azshara now.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard has shown to have cinematics and story updates come out any time during patches in BFA. There's obviously more specifics to come, and they will when it makes sense. Would it make sense if N'zoth was 100% fully released right there in the background of Jaina and Lorthremar, but then we chilled and did dailies for 4 months? This is all we needed right now.<br />
<br />
When we killed KJ, and the portal between Argus and Azeroth was opened, did we get ARGUS THE UNMAKER spelled out for us? No.<br />
<br />

Makes me wonder if whoever put Sylvanas on the throne and whispered to Vol'jin was at play here aswell.<br />
<br />
That aside, it's pretty much what everyone knew would happen, Azshara loses but N'zoth is released. Means 8.2.5 might deal with some faction stuff but 8.3 will be N'zoth. I still kinda think N'zoth might be next expansion, though. IDK, guess we'll see.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The way I saw it. N'Zoth doesn't have a corporal form yet (His Tentacles are made of smoke, unlike what we are used to with Old Gods and what we've seen of him in cinematics. And he might have grabbed a dying Azshara as a vessel. I guess we will have to see.</div></div><hr />

It seemed way too short, and there was no &quot;twist&quot; like Blizzard said there was going to be. Unless the &quot;twist&quot; was N'zoth being released, which isn't a twist at all cause literally everyone knew was going to happen for months now... It also wasn't really clear as to who's going to be the final boss of the xpac. Are we going for Round 2 with Azshara, or is N'zoth just going to be a &quot;one-and-done&quot; patch boss (which would be an incredible stupid thing to happen for such a massively important lore character)?<br />

<br />
Either that or as some god-infused Endboss. I'm sure we gonna see her again and she will be controlled in some way. It all depends on whether the players will face N'zoth this expansion or next. Given the likely still decreasing numbers of players I do not think that Blizz is going to drag out any long storylines tho. They will throw on the players whatever they think will hold them for another year or 2. It's the LOST-principle...&quot;it all will make sense and be fun in the end&quot;(Spoiler: It didn't and it ended pretty crappy).</div></div><hr />

Its been a 'Saturday morning cartoon' for years and years and years. But heres the thing. Saturday morning cartoons are fun. Chill out. If you are still playing WoW and still expecting advanced/quality storytelling, you are fooling yourself. <br />
At this point that cinematic really ought not have surprised anyone, and if you weren't prepared for exactly this sort of 'NEXT WEEK ON WOW' clip have just not been paying attention. <br />
Stop expecting depth where there isn't any. Its just going to keep your blood pressure up.<br />
<br />
Exactly. This guy gets it. The people that expect good lore today, are the same people who time and time again have kept hoping since wrath the lore would improve. But they refuse to just accept it never ever will (start of expansion launches no longer counts!) i am talking the overall full length of an expansions Life Cycle. But such is people that keep having their own expectations up constantly. They know what they are in for, if they don't get what they hope. They never ever learn...</div></div><hr />

My impressions of her reaction and expression to N'Zoth's contact with her could be one of two things -<br />
<br />
- Extreme shock/pain of being wretched from a dying state<br />
<br />
- Bit of a stretch, but going with the fear theory it could be that she believed her servitude to N'Zoth was to conclude upon freeing him in this encounter. Now that he's resuscitated and taken her with him she's come to the realisation of the horror that she will likely loose what's left of her agency &amp; free will when she's inevitably corrupted further to continue servitude (think The Mountain in GoT), a fate worse than death.</div></div><hr />

I agree that it shouldn't come as a shock that the story is still bad, but saying something like &quot;it has always sucked and you should just accept that&quot; doesn't exactly speak well about the quality of WoW nor is it an effective way of convincing people to stop ragging on it.</div></div><hr />

And yet we have defeated something even stronger than that before...Sargeras and Argus were hell way more powerful and more dangerous...so again? what is so exciting about this? all of that were predictable I knew N'zoth will be fully released even before the release of this patch really even a blind man can predict and see that coming really... no twist.. no big surprise...nothing unexpected. So yeah I still question it...what is so exciting about that? but then again Blizzard's writing been like that forever really.<br />
<br />
<br />
I still remember Metzen speech about the ending of Dragon Soul raid lore in Cataclysm and how the ending of that expansion is so bad ass and legendary!!! then what we got in the end? oh no dragons aspects lost their powers and the age of humanity is born....<br />
<br />
Seriously whoever find these stuff are exciting really... no offense but talk about bad taste...<br />

Just watch the first 45 seconds, its basicly the same just in a different order.<br />
<br />
- Heroes get close to a defeated Queen Azshara<br />
- Archimonde is defeaded ---- N'zoth got free<br />
- Gul'dan is shocked and pulled into a Fel portal ---- Queen Azshara is shocked and pulled into a shadow portal <br />
- Heroes get close to a defeated Archimonde <br />
<br />
Only difference is that you see the dialog that we would fight together in the future in the WoD cinematic and in the BfA cinematic we only get this in a dialog text after the cinematic between Jaina and Lor'themar.<br />

She is really not that important. People overhyped her to be some supervillain but she was only relevant for a small portion of history. They said she was going to be the Gul'dan of this expansion and it looks like that is exactly what she will be.</div></div><hr />

Uhm yes? remember over a decade ago when we didn't have to speculate about a big bad / what happends next. Because the games own lore was actually decent enough and felt like a fantasy world. Not a Big Block Buster experience copy from Movies? i sure remember. No one complained about it back then. Because it was good!</div></div><hr />

What do you mean, she is a big part of warcraft story since warcraft 3. In the RPG it was even stated she was extremely powerful as well. I think the reason of why they used her like that is somewhat related to the the Lich King in his xpac. Let me explain why the comparison, back at Wrath they were afraid of making a full ice xpac so they kinda &quot;fixed&quot; that doing those out of places areas that arent frozen. Azshara would be similiar I guess but at the same time harder because how do you do it with an enemy thats basically water based? They tried a water zone in cata and it appears it didnt work well, might be the reason of why they aborted some Azshara expac. I mean they could put an island or another but overall all the areas would need to be underwater. Its already very weird that her area in this xpac is kinda land based for whatever reason but that would be even more absurd if it was for a whole xpac.</div></div><hr />

The RPG is non-canon, but she was stated to be almost equal to Kil'jaedan/Archimonde, as stated by Mannoroth (Take that as you will). That is the only power level we have, any &quot;shes been buffed by N'zoth&quot; is headcannon that has never been directly stated (Also why would the weakest Old God want to risk making his ambitious pawn powerful?). Yeah even if she had her own Xpack it would not be underwater, people just did not like that.<br />

<br />
Her endgame has always just been about making everyone serve her. She has never been a real leader because she has always gone undersway of someone more powerful (Sargeras, now N'zoth). The Naga as well have never really had an agenda of their own, and their entire race has been used as pawns by multiple sources.</div></div><hr />

Oh, I know the RPG is considered non canon nowadays but still a lot of their info still stands after all this long. Also what matters is that she is powerful and was actually someone with a big army thats enough of a plot to have a full expac. Still I agree the main problem of doing that is making an underwater xpac. They tried a zone and didnt please blizzard or the players thats probably why she wouldnt get her own expansion. As I said before I supose they could put some land areas such as islands but the bulk would need to be underwater for enemies such as the naga. BTW what explanation did they give for her entire zone not being underwater, why is the water hold at bay? Don't see how that benefits the naga.</div></div><hr />

Knaifu is an old god herself. She is the weakest she is talking about, she's just a baby old god. <br />

She's been manipulating us though throughout history to kill C'thun, Yogg, Y'shaarj, now N'zoth. Then there will only be one left: her &lt;3<br />

She used the Tidestone to open up the water, the goal is to get you into her palace so she can use the heart to free N'zoth (which she does successfully). So she really only needed you alive for that.</div></div><hr />

The writing is in desperate need of improvement.<br />

Kinda sad they wasted Azshara and her reign like that (okay, she didnt die but still). She could easily be the major villain in her own expansion.<br />
<br />
She couldn't or it would be a case of them not knowing the lore they've established. Here's hoping if she isn't dead from that snap when picked up that she's just some random void boss in the last raid and we're rid of all of the head canon about her. She should have died in a quest like Ysera.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am not moaning at all. I stated I love the universe and the game and still playing it. However, the story is so laughably predictable and for me personally I am sick of so many obvious predictability. I enjoy more twists and surprises like Game of Thrones and the song of ice and fire novels.<br />
<br />
<br />
I mean it doesn't have to be at the level of the novels of Game of Thrones in term of twists really but it has to be less predictable for me to be fun at least. This is my personal taste and my personal opinion. I am not moaning or hating at all.</div></div><hr />

Ah, got it. Still, wouldn't be easy just to drown everyone and get the heart instead of having hundreds of alliance and horde soldiers harassing and destroying everything in their path to her palace? Plus why would naga deny the advantage of fighting underwater? Its so crazy.<br />

What do you mean? She is a huge player in warcraft since the third game, way more important than this old god that only got relevant now. There is a ton of stuff about her, if anything she is one of the most important lore characters since warcraft 3 and through all wow since vanila where naga are everywhere.<br />

<br />
Yeah, its so dissapointing to have her to be a simple raid patch boss instead of getting her own expac (even if I already spoke about why sadly this wouldnt happen due to the mechanics of a underwater xpac). She is bigger than Illidan ever was, I mean they had to beef up and give Illidan a huge army for bc (he did lost so much fighting Arthas in frozen throne expac). Azshara has an army since they went underwater, an army that only grew from there on, hence why there is naga EVERYWHERE since classic.<br />
<br />
If years ago I were to name the villians that would get an expac she would be just bellow Arthas.</div></div><hr />
