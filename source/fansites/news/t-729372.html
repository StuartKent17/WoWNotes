Blizzard to start throttling inspect requests<br />
An interesting announcement was posted on Wowace.com (http://www.wowace.com/announcements/blizzard-to-start-throttling-inspect-requests/). It looks like Blizzard will start throttling inspect requests from players, most likely to counter the giant amount of load caused by ... well, you know, Gearscore.<br />
<br />
I've received word that after the next set of rolling restarts, which may be happening as early as tonight, inspection requests on other players will start to be throttled.<br />
<br />
This is being done because some addons generate a large number of inspection requests, so beware as some addons may start to behave unexpectedly, flat out break, or otherwise act up. Overall I hope it not to be too bad, but you never know, so here's the heads up.<br />
<br />
Addon authors may need to restructure their addon so that they may _never_ receive a response back from a request. We may be seeing several second long intervals between allowed requests, and as I said, some request will likely never be answered.<br />
<br />
If I hear any more details I'll update the post. (WoWace (http://www.wowace.com/announcements/blizzard-to-start-throttling-inspect-requests/))<br />
<br />
And Blizzard's word about it! <br />
It&#8217;s important to understand that the throttling that is being done isn&#8217;t intended to break any functionality of add-ons, but merely to control the amount of queries that are being sent to the server at any given time. (Thus throttling the queries.) The queries will still occur, it just won&#8217;t happen as quickly as they currently seem to. You can read the statements that WoW Ace and WoW Interface have up for a bit more information on these changes. We wanted to give mod authors a heads-up prior to making the change so that they could make any adjustments they needed to on their mods.<br />

Blue posts<br />
Epic items in Cataclysm<br />
We're actually working on restoring the epic feeling to epic items in Cataclysm. Epic loot should be epic, and something to be very proud of. Our plan is to try and get the Heroic -&gt; Blue Gear and Raid -&gt; Purple Gear balance back. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/13816832302/epic/))<br />
<br />
Icecrown Citadel Heroic attempts<br />
I apologize for the confusion. The number of attempts allotted for end bosses is still 50. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/23425467230/icecrown-citadel-raid-buffs-active/))<br />
<br />
Remote Mail Service?<br />
The idea to access and send in-game mails through a web and/or mobile based service is something that is being considered. We are always researching new potential additions to our web/mobile services btw :-) <br />
<br />
[...] No need to jump to conclusions. As Vaneras said, we're always looking for ways to expand the interactivity of our web and mobile services, and this is one that is already in our minds as a feature that could easily be used under the existing Remote service or similar. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/13705622245/access-to-mail-via-wow-remote/))<br />
<br />
Classic and TBC Dungeon Maps<br />
We hope to add dungeon maps to those outside of Northrend. &quot;When?&quot; you ask? Well, sometime in the future. I cannot elaborate further on that at the moment. :) [...] On the priority list of 'things to do' I can confidently say it's not up there with the high fliers, but it's on the list.

Thats why you get underachiever &gt;,&lt; .... most raid leaders dont bother inspecting the players achievement in person since its too much work for them... Altho GS can be faked too by getting pvp gear which has fairly high ilvl, but thats effort.</div></div><hr />

Given that there is only 5 levels difference and Heroics will drop blues, with the large difference in stats between Superior and Epic, does that mean that there will be a HUGE increase in ilevel between level 80 and level 85 items. Otherwise, why bother doing Heroics when the gear will be close to equal to what you have now? Take a look at a level 75 blue in WOLK and compare it to top level epics in TBC. The epics are superior in many cases.<br />

Reducing server lag by making Gearscore fanatics wait just makes me smile.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In fact, this will make the GS creator's job easier, since he don't need to worry about throttling request in his own mod anymore. Now he can just spam request until he get a result back and let the server deal with throttling. That was a major problem back when GS just started and now blizzard fixed it for him. <br />

Breaking GS would pretty much require disabling inspection completely, which will break all the &quot;GS alternatives&quot; out there anyway.</div></div><hr />

I don't see this as being a 'GS Killer', but it will certainly put a strain on the community that uses it the most, which is people who misuse it.

wow-heroes gets data from the armory, which is already throttled. In fact the armory request throttle is even more intensive than in-game inspection throttle ever will be, because armory requests give more data back.</div></div><hr />

<br />
pugging spawned the misuse of gearscore, along with acheivement linking and posting your dps. All of these go hand in hand with pugging, and cannot be removed with out removing pugging. if you want pugging to remain, suck it up and deal with the GS obsesed RLs. <br />

They could &quot;degrade&quot; the quality of items over time as a function of the &quot;highest&quot; ilvl available. <br />
<br />
if (ITEMLVL &gt; MAXILVL - 10) then<br />
COLOR=&quot;Purple&quot;<br />
elseif (ITEMLVL &gt; MAXILVL -50) then<br />
COLOR=&quot;Blue&quot;<br />
end<br />
Something like that would be very easy to do, but it would mean content patches cause your purples to become blues... and some blues to become greens, and some greens to turn white, I would think grey would always be grey, maybe you use the lowest 10 item lvls for that, so the above should be ITEMLVL+10 and MAXITEMLVL+10, but the idea is the same.</div></div><hr />

That's an interesting idea but with the way item budgeting works you couldn't simply downgrade the color of an item without downgrading the total stat values on the item.</div></div><hr />

His code means &quot;If the X item's iLvl &gt; MaxiLvl then blah blah blah&quot; It doesnt downgrade it's iLvl at all. Given that they change the MaxiLvl value every new tier, it could possibly work, but it would suck :D</div></div><hr />

People use it correctly nowadays and it has become an useful tool<br />
<br />
Because requesting 5.4 GS and up for regular ToC is using it correctly. It's abusing it. I understand doing it for a fast run, but when my 5k alt wants to run something I have done many times, can't go... It's ridiculous.</div></div><hr />

I'm looking forward to the anti-pugging policy blizzard seems to be taking in cataclysm. getcho lazy asses in a guild!<br />
<br />
<br />
Doesn't seem to be an anti-pugging policy, they're just attempting to make it easier to get into a pug, after all, you don't pug to kill the hardest boss during that time period do you, no, you pug because you're either bored, want to show off, helping a friend need gear, or again, terribly bored.

Both even when used &quot;correctly&quot; in the loosest sense of the word are flawed as a pug requirement, and neither tend to prove any sort of skill.<br />
This is not killing gearscore as much as I would love to have that happen, <br />
There are too many people keen to flame the gearscore haters, but the way in which people use the addon aside, I am glad to see some sort of action to reign it back despite the minimal effect it will have on the majority of us, and those like myself not using it. More from a performance drain view, which I can but hope means a reduction in the lags which despite blizzard's rush to always blame us or our ISP's is often down to them.<br />
<br />
Blizzard are keen to offer guilds something other than just regular groups for content.<br />
Offering perks for regular participation and progress other than just gear which I see as a good thing.<br />
The gearscore mentality is what screws over players who are not in a guild more than anything, not what blizzard are doing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well the way it stands now color is not arbitrary. An ilvl 200 purple has more stat points allocated in its budget than a ilvl 200 blue. Changing the color of an item means you have to remove points from the item's overall stat budget.<br />
<br />
I'd pull up an example but I'm at work and can't connect to wowhead. Check out ilvl 200 leather belts and compare them not from a dps perspective but from a raw stat allocation perspective.<br />
<br />
Under Blizzard's current stat budgeting system though it's not possible, thats all I was saying.<br />
<br />
On topic though I really really hope that this is the first step towards killing GS.</div></div><hr />

Breaking addons, cutting down on queries...where is all that extra revenue going? Obviously not server infrastructure.<br />

I am glad they want to improve loot in Cata, maybe they can go back to the pre-dumbing down of the game ways. back when epics were a rarity, not 100% of your gear. Legendary items are the new epic.</div></div><hr />

The mod should only tell a player's GS if they are actually inspected, not just mouseover. I'm not sure how the mod works but it shows me Gearscore in my tooltip which I can imagine inquiries the database whenever a player is in range. It would really, really reduce traffic if you had to manually inspect a player to get GS. It could just as well be taken out of the tooltip and put into the character inspect panel.</div></div><hr />

It did in Vanilla when it took a lot of work to get an epic in every slot. I think raids in BC actually dropped blues too. Nowadays you can get max level and epic-ed out in a day or two. I remember getting really excited in BC when I got full epics, but I didn't feel nearly the same way in LK. <br />
<br />
Epics these days are more common than blue items. Wowhead lists 4447 epic items, 1145 rare items, and 1470 uncommon items added in WotLK. Wowhead also lists 1023 epics, 1769 rare items, and 3368 uncommon items in Vanilla.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The only reason why it took longer in vanilla was because you shared &quot;your&quot; loot with ~4 others, and at the same time a raid boss only dropped 3-5 pieces (with the exception of end-bosses), and we also had dungeon sets in vanilla, which were removed in WotLK and no badged-system.<br />
<br />
TBC didn't drop blue/rare items in raid instances. UBRS, AQ20 and ZG20 being the only ones that did (After the nerf/fix of the other level 60 dungeons).<br />
<br />
When counting epics added in WotLK you seems to forget that for every base-tier set there are 2-3 upgrades.</div></div><hr />

Yeah right. Gearscore or elitist group and the like will never go away. they are just too damn handy when it comes to building a raid.<br />
<br />
When I build a raid I want <br />
a) people to know the fight -&gt; you have to check the persons achievements for that, which elitist group does<br />
b) people to be adequately geared for the raid -&gt; either you take the time and inspect the gear manually (which will also be throttled, and takes a long time) or you take a quick glance at their average item level/gearscore which gives you an estimate of what the char should be capable of.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Your list is all what it SHOULD be. But the problem is, to tell if that person has been boosted through achievements or not, or if they're capable of actually pressing more than one button.<br />
GS doesn't tell this, nor any other addon really.<br />

Well... just about any addon that works by inspecting is designed to see how well geared a character is in just the same way that gearscore is. They may all work in slightly different ways - but if gearscore was broken and the others not, then instead of &quot;please link GS&quot;.... it would be &quot;please link ImImbaAddon&quot; or whatever.<br />
<br />
Anyway - gearscore wont be broken by this, it just wont update as fast - some people will have out of date scans - but that happens now too. I don't have a problem with add-ons that check peoples gear, the problem is when people using them are too demanding... &quot;LFM ToC10, Link achi and GS 5200+ only&quot; etc. This is NOT new.... I remember the same (but to a lesser degree because less people were as well geared) in BC. Maggy pugs wanting people in MH or BT gear etc.<br />
<br />
People will always want people who way out gear content because it means they can run through that content faster, and one thing that wotlk has encouraged is faster faster faster now now now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I know. People are idiots. And since you can't judge their skill without taking the time and actually raid with them you have to rely on the next best thing: their gear and spec. Addons can guess the players role by inspecting the spec and they even could tell you how good the spec actually is by comparing it to a default spec. Same goes with itemization. GS is rather dumb in that it does not evaluate enchants and gems, but elitist group actually does that.<br />
<br />
In a perfect world where people only queue for raids they actually know and can handle we would not need these addons. but people lie and slack are idiots so we need some way to prevent those idiots from entering our raid.</div></div><hr />

We're actually working on restoring the epic feeling to epic items in Cataclysm. Epic loot should be epic, and something to be very proud of. Our plan is to try and get the Heroic -&gt; Blue Gear and Raid -&gt; Purple Gear balance back.<br />
<br />
Heroics should still drop epics, but 'lesser' versions of the hard-to-get off-pieces only. Raid the Tier0 dungeon for your tier-gear, which being head-chest-hand-leggings-gloves, and have heroics drop things like epics bracers, boots, trinkets and weapons to complement them. That way players who arent -yet- lucky enough to obtain theirs in the tier0 raid, can still obtain an epic for these slots - albeit a version thats a bit less good.</div></div><hr />

<br />
iLvl 300 is Blues only. Every boss in Heroics drops a iLvl300 blue, the final boss drops a Blue and an Epic iLvl 310, which is what you don't get from a tier. This menas wrist, boots, necks, trinkets, rings. Something you can drop in the tier1 raid, and will be stronger, but if you didnt have enough luck, you can still get the epics from Heroics which are subpar but still good to let you get in a raid.<br />
<br />
Also, harder heroics final boss should drop all the kind of epic weapons to be a &quot;starter&quot; weapon for raids.</div></div><hr />

<br />
for those that speak of a color degrading, keep in mind that the color actually works as a statcost multiplyer (better color= the less a stat costs in terms of ilvl).<br />
<br />
Since cata is &quot;only&quot; 5 lvls, they could simply make the original heroic blues have the same ilvl difference to the lbl 85 normal dungeon ones as they have to lvl 80 cata blues.<br />
<br />
to take wotlk examples http://www.wowhead.com/item=37461 is a lvl 70 spear (ilvl 145) http://www.wowhead.com/item=41815 a lvl 75 one (ilvl 175) http://www.wowhead.com/item=43409 a lvl 80 one (ilvl 200), so they could make the cata blue normal one ilvl 300, the lvl 85 normal one ilvl 340 and the lvl 85 heroic one 380 and more optimised stats. (just taking some numbers for cata) the 1st raid then could start @ ilvl 380 epics in normal and 420 in hardmode. any new dungeons added later on then could have ilvl 380 blues in normal, 420 in heroic as the new raid would have 420-460.<br />
<br />
an epic item of ilvl X is about good as an equally itemised blue of ilvl X*1.1, so there still would be good progression from 5man heroics to normal raid gear</div></div><hr />

&quot;QQ It touches me at night!!!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
I mean really, do you people not understand that it is the COMMUNITY doing you wrong not the ADD ON? Before GS people were saying:<br />
<br />
&quot;LFM ICC10 fresh run have [Lich Kings Fall 25]!&quot;<br />
&quot;LFM ICC10 4k+ AP, SP or 65k health!&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
How was this any differnt? When people are saying:<br />
<br />
&quot;QQ I cant get epix from icc cuz they wont let me in!&quot; Achievement based system is going put the same gating, same roadblock on progression. So are min. Attack/spell power numbers. But you people have such a unfounded blind hatred of the Gearscore addon that you wont see that and don't care if you are still road blocked you just don't want GS around.<br />
<br />
<br />
What are you going to do if we go back need &quot;link achieve&quot;? Use underachiever to cheat your way in? Personally when people whisper me I ask how far they've gotten and they say (for example) that they have finished the Lowerspire + Festergut/rotface, I'll ask for the achievement and of course they link it. So then I do to Wow-heroes and do a live search and if they have it I invite them. If they don't have it I usually throw their name out in trade and tell everyone they're a cheat.<br />
<br />
If anything needs broken its the ability for addons and players the screw with the /script to allow faking of achievements.<br />

<br />
Gearscore hasn't changed anything except for making things faster and easier. If I were to create a raid before, I'd have to look at everyone's armory to make sure they're geared enough for the fight. Now I just have them whisper me gearscore and I get an approximation of how well they will perform. <br />
<br />
Sure I may not know how good a 5.4k GS player will perform, but I know he's probably going to do better than a 4.8k gs player. <br />
<br />
The only people who don't like GS are the ones who don't actually have any. A hint would be... go get some better gear then you'll be invited. If you don't like the GS that the raid leader is asking for, then be a man and actually go create your own. <br />
<br />
A couple weeks ago I was asking for ICC 10. I was asking for a minimum of 5.1k GS which is perfectly acceptable now that the buff was at 20% at that time. <br />
<br />
Some moron whispers me and says his GS was 4.5k. So that told me two things. 1, he can't listen to instruction at all. The instruction clearly only asked for 5.1k min but he was dumb enough to not pay attention to that part. <br />
<br />
second, he told me &quot;dont worryz I good&quot; yeah right, am I'm supposed to believe a guy that can't even read?<br />

Gearscore Ruined pugging, nothing good came from it. Its harder then hell for ppl not in top guilds to get into pugs with that damn addon out. Also there are plenty of ppl with 5k gs that out preform 5.5s plenty. And its not just people with low gearscore that hate it, to my knowlege I'm one of the most geared characters on my server, will probably be when I get my shadowmourne soon (2nd in the guild), and I absolutely hate the damn thing.<br />
<br />
I had friends on another server / faction that the server was absolutly ran by gearscore, the server was horrible, no pug was ever successful, it sucked. I told them about my server that barely ever uses it, and if you do you get made fun of (for good reason). I got them to xfer to mine, but before they did i leveled a 2nd death knight there with only 5.1k gs (which they had to tell me) and topped almost every damage meter. (and I'm not talking of heriocs, I'm talking of raids, 25toc, icc 10 / 25) <br />

Gearscore is no different from that, except that it saves you time. If used correctly, this addon is perfect for setting up a raid.<br />
<br />
Of course, it's being abused all the time, which makes people pissed off, but a lot of comments here have a point. Not everyone can enter a certain raid instance. It requires gear, knowledge and some common sense.<br />
<br />
There are ways to check that a player has these qualities:<br />
Gear - Gearscore<br />
Knowledge - Achievement (+ you could ask them beforehand to summarize the tactics of a certain boss)<br />
Common sense - (This is really up to you. I certainly don't like people with poor English)</div></div><hr />

&quot;It's made raid leading so much easier.&quot; - It has not made raid leading &quot;easier&quot; raid leading is the same game it was in Vanilla and BC, as a raid leader you need to know every role and the fight like the back of your hand, knowing GS does not change this in any way and if you think it does you are part of the problem not the solution.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Now I just have them whisper me gearscore and I get an approximation of how well they will perform.&quot;- No, it just means that they have spent more time farming badges. I can be decked out in all t10 by now but it does not mean I know how to get out of fire in a timely manner.<br />
<br />
<br />

Say the GearScore addon sends a request every time anyone is in range, without regard to how often. So if 50 characters are in range, it sends 50 requests per second. If you throttle it, say to 10 requests per second, then it will get the first 10 back the first second, and then the next, and so on, taking 5 seconds to query all 50 instead of 1 second.<br />

Obviously it's a lot more complicated than that, but this should give you the general idea.</div></div><hr />

No it doesn't. We've all experienced that system, and frankly if you had trouble progressing before everyone used GS it was because you sucked or your realm simply sucks and it's full of bads so people take extra precaution before inviting people they don't know. <br />
<br />
I never needed to have all the keepers down and Yogg or even a good amount of hardmodes to get into good groups for Ulduar during 3.1. But then again my toons were all itemized as perfectly as they could be and I handled my role very well even when undergeared compared to other people with better gear or achievement that were &quot;more difficult to obtain&quot;.<br />
<br />
I had and still have a good reputation on all the realms I play on, not even because I'm particularly tight with any specific group of people.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I very much doubt this will affect Gearscore in the general case.<br />
<br />
What this will do is stop people who mouse over huge crowds in Dalaran from accidentally slamming the server infrastructure (without even knowing they're doing so).<br />
<br />
When you're forming up a raid, you don't inspect a dozen people a second. I doubt there will be much in the way of throttling, and at worst, you'll probably see a few, &quot;just a sec, waiting for GS to refresh,&quot; from raid leaders who can always manually inspect if a GS inspect failed, after waiting a second.<br />
<br />
The GS database will still be very useful and the GS extra functionality beyond just the base number will all continue to work.<br />

Why do people act like GS is so evil?<br />
<br />
&quot;QQ It touches me at night!!!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
I mean really, do you people not understand that it is the COMMUNITY doing you wrong not the ADD ON? Before GS people were saying:<br />
<br />
&quot;LFM ICC10 fresh run have [Lich Kings Fall 25]!&quot;<br />
&quot;LFM ICC10 4k+ AP, SP or 65k health!&quot;<br />
<br />
GS gives people something to focus on. They want to believe that they'd be treated more fairly if GS didn't exist. It's just human nature.<br />

Epic items in Cataclysm<br />
We're actually working on restoring the epic feeling to epic items in Cataclysm. Epic loot should be epic, and something to be very proud of. Our plan is to try and get the Heroic -&gt; Blue Gear and Raid -&gt; Purple Gear balance back.<br />
After the first teir raids I'm sure there will be plenty of &quot;catch up&quot; epics handed out.<br />
<br />
I think the idea, here, is that they don't have to be epics. If dungeon tiers 1, 2, 3 and 4 aren't epics and raid tiers 1, 2, 3 and 4 are, then people in epics have obviously been raiding and those in blues have been instancing.<br />
<br />
Now, blue dungeon tier 4 might be equivalent ilvl to raid tier 2 or 3, but that doesn't mean its name has to be purple.<br />
<br />
I think they're looking to have raiding return to being a bit more of a point of pride rather than just &quot;the higher ilvl version of dungeon gear.&quot;<br />
<br />

<br />
Yes, you're getting it... before GS people filtered raiders on insane criteria just as they do today, which was because everyone's realm sucks and they're full of &quot;bads&quot;. Correct.<br />
<br />
Now, when Naxx first launched, this wasn't the case, but even then there were people who were demanding that you needed to be in full ilvl 200 gear to do Naxx, and frankly that just wasn't true (though fresh leveling greens were right out).<br />
<br />
Here it is in a nutshell: if you want non-insane gear requirements for raids, join a good guild. Even if GS went away tomorrow (which it won't, because this change really doesn't impact its use for raids), it would still be the case that PUG recruiters would be looking for you to be over-geared in order to join.</div></div><hr />

I have been saying the loot tables should've gone back to how they were in Vanilla for years. Epics aren't &quot;epic&quot; anymore. First raid you get a slew of them, and then as the tiers go up, your old epics become trash (worse to scale than blue raid items compared to the epic ones back in Vanilla WoW). Now if you see someone with blues, they won't be automatically considered &quot;undergeared&quot; or &quot;noob.&quot; And when you see someone with epics, you won't have to check to see if they are &quot;good&quot; epics or &quot;garbage&quot; epics. It all works out :D<br />
<br />
P.S.<br />
<br />
Even though it might not go back to exactly how it was (I'm thinking maybe a mix of B.C. and Vanilla), it would still be a welcome change imo, because the way it is now, basically anything green, blue and even some epics are just useless all around. My old Vanilla hunter had all blues, a green trinket and one epic chestpiece (that I was super proud of btw). I guess I'm just a little nostalgic.</div></div><hr />

Best comment in this topic :)<br />
<br />
Also once I pugged on of the icc 5 mans when I had low gear on my resto shaman. The group let me die, no ressers were there, so I had to walk. They were clearing trash without a healer. When I was back, they were almost death and attacked right away a new group before I could heal anyone. After one person died, I actually managed to save a few, said someone that I was totaly doing it wrong at healing, and he had also a resto shaman but then of 6k gs. like I care, I couldnt one heal all of them(he can with that good gear :/ ), I just healed so that I could at least save one. but well, this is a good example that people use it for measuring skills.<br />

Nope, Hope they fix Gearscore, AWESOME addon. Besides letting me look at that priest in WG with a 1.8k gs who wants into voa and saying &quot;Really?&quot; It lets me use /gs to judge the level of gear the person is using and what they are possibly doing wrong. The only thing that people that make comments like this have are blinde hatred of something for completely and utterly unfounded reasons. You can get 5k+ GS from heroics/Triumph emblems. Stop being lazy getting geared for ICC is cake. Or better yet, get a guild! make friends! make your OWN RAID. Stop expecting everyone else to do things for you. Not to mention, if GS goes away I will continue to use Wow-heroes and thats what youll start to see<br />

Gearscore was made to optimize your gear for Flame Leviathan Hard Mode. Not for what it has become today.<br />
<br />
Gearscore won't go away. You can fight it all you want, but it's here to stay. Blizzard can't break it with out changing the way loot quality works. It doesn't make the game easier or &quot;deface the game world&quot; like AVR did.<br />

I use the addon only while tanking PUG 5 mans or the weekly. It kinda gauges how much facerolling I will get to do and if I'll get to pull 1 trash pack or half the instance. Outside of that, I play the game like it was meant to be played originally - I am in a guild (well, guildmaster), I have a crew of good players and we raid on certain days and times. It's amazing but we are pretty elitist about who we take - I mean with the whole dps requirement, knowing wtf you are doing, and such and such.<br />
<br />
Massively Multiplayer Online RPG.... Somewhere in that name it means &quot;social&quot; and &quot;must play with others to get stuff accomplished&quot;. Which is where raid tier tokens for badges kinda chap me but oh well, I'll survive.<br />
<br />
Recruiting wise, I tend to use the Skill Score mod. It's a private mod me and my officers use. Here's what it does: It measures the damage the dps does, the healing that healers do, and the threat that tanks are able to pull. It's pretty cool because it also tells me when people stand in fires, blow up the raid, or take damage when they could have avoided it. Overall it gives me a score of a person's ability. I think the mod doesn't work in weekly pugs though because when I am in there I am usually #1 dps and #1 threat by a mile (except for hunter pets), and it is constantly going off telling me people are standing in fires and such.<br />
<br />
I jest here, but in reality, gearscore is only important if you are one of those people that isn't willing to or doesn't have time to put your efforts into a guild and must pug things to get your gear. I would probably rather saw my fingers off one-by-one with a rusty saw (while standing in a fire) than play an MMO that way, but to each their own.</div></div><hr />

&quot;The current tier will most likely be of a quality higher than the gear available using the emblem from the previous tier, as it is now (though of course this may be subjective depending on the exact class and spec). However, what comparisons can be made between the quality of emblem gear and that which is obtained in raids are details that we are not quite ready to reveal.

<br />
so...all those crying 'this change won't matter, because after the first raid tier, everybody will have epics!', might want calm down.<br />

<br />
Gearscore hasn't changed anything except for making things faster and easier. If I were to create a raid before, I'd have to look at everyone's armory to make sure they're geared enough for the fight. Now I just have them whisper me gearscore and I get an approximation of how well they will perform. <br />
<br />
Sure I may not know how good a 5.4k GS player will perform, but I know he's probably going to do better than a 4.8k gs player. <br />
<br />
The only people who don't like GS are the ones who don't actually have any. A hint would be... go get some better gear then you'll be invited. If you don't like the GS that the raid leader is asking for, then be a man and actually go create your own. <br />
<br />
A couple weeks ago I was asking for ICC 10. I was asking for a minimum of 5.1k GS which is perfectly acceptable now that the buff was at 20% at that time. <br />
<br />
Some moron whispers me and says his GS was 4.5k. So that told me two things. 1, he can't listen to instruction at all. The instruction clearly only asked for 5.1k min but he was dumb enough to not pay attention to that part. <br />
<br />
second, he told me &quot;dont worryz I good&quot; yeah right, am I'm supposed to believe a guy that can't even read?<br />
<br />
Therefore, Gearscore is the best thing that's happened to WoW. It just lets smart people know who the bad people are so they can stay away from them.<br />
<br />
Apparently you can't read and are lazy too if you can't manually gear check people.</div></div><hr />

You have designers working manhours turning code into characters, gear and inverioment - then you install addons which turn their work back into numbers.<br />

Yep, 3300gs blues in 25-man ICC. Every last toon.<br />
<br />
Now, I don't recommend doing this by default, but can a 4500GS healer &quot;get by&quot;. You bet your pants they can. What they can't do is compensate for bad players the way a 5500 or 6000 GS healer can. And there's the difference. When you demand that people be overgeared, you're saying, &quot;I can't guarantee that we won't suck, so we need a safety net.&quot; There's nothing wrong with that, but let's not kid ourselves, here. You're not recruiting for skill, you're recruiting with the expectation that skill is the one thing you won't get.<br />

<br />
I'm going to try to break this to you gently: no one ever cared what race your toon was for purposes of raiding except back in the day when one or two races actually had insane racial buffs which trumped a certain level of gearing. When you asked, back in TBC, if you could join that SSC pug and the guy, who was standing right in front of you, paused for a few seconds before saying no, he was inspecting you and manually tallying up your gear's ilevel. That he now has a mod that does it has changed nothing other than you have a mod to point at and blame for what you never really liked about the game.<br />

Well, Blizzard can still pull this off. Instead of epics handout, blue gear iLevel will rise in power. Either from subsequent 5m hc or &quot;giveaway blues&quot; that will be almost equal in power to previous raid tier.<br />
<br />
Cata 1st tier = 360 iL epic / 5m = 355 iL rare<br />
Cata 2nd tier = 375 iL -- / &quot;5m&quot; = 370 iL rare<br />
Cata 3th tier = 390 iL -- / &quot;5m&quot; = 385 iL rare</div></div><hr />

When you asked, back in TBC, if you could join that SSC pug and the guy, who was standing right in front of you, paused for a few seconds before saying no, he was inspecting you and manually tallying up your gear's ilevel. That he now has a mod that does it has changed nothing other than you have a mod to point at and blame for what you never really liked about the game.<br />
<br />
I don't think you should like gear elitism but I also don't think you should be blaming GS for it.<br />

Well, then, why dont we just remove the character models completely and replace them with numbers? Would be awesome - Orgimmar full of numberplates? Next time it`s a addon which reduce arcitecture to flat boxes because it optimize the players fps? Or bosses in raid instances reduced to a health bar. Textures removed.<br />
I know ppl used to inspect gear. But having to do stuff like that are often part of roleplaying - just as walking for 10 minutes to get to a town for the first time. Sometimes a small inconvenience is rewarding in a greater picture. Walking to a town is boring while doing it but it feels rewarding when you se the towns skyline emerge out of the fog.<br />
Ppl look at other players and see the GS number first. They ignore the work the devs put in to armor design and character animations, because the numberplate in their face is what matters. I remember looking at a Hunter in full Dragonstalker and thinking &quot;man that looks epic!&quot;. With GS i would prolly just have noticed the 6k digit.<br />
Its a slide. And it is sliding the wrong direction.<br />
Rpg is about diving into a convincing illusion - addons like GS are breaking this illusion.</div></div><hr />

&quot;It's made raid leading so much easier.&quot; - It has not made raid leading &quot;easier&quot; raid leading is the same game it was in Vanilla and BC, as a raid leader you need to know every role and the fight like the back of your hand, knowing GS does not change this in any way and if you think it does you are part of the problem not the solution.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Now I just have them whisper me gearscore and I get an approximation of how well they will perform.&quot;- No, it just means that they have spent more time farming badges. I can be decked out in all t10 by now but it does not mean I know how to get out of fire in a timely manner.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure I may not know how good a 5.4k GS player will perform, but I know he's probably going to do better than a 4.8k gs player.&quot;- This seems to be the exact opposite of what he said in the line before.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;It just lets smart people know who the bad people are so they can stay away from them.&quot;<br />
<br />
Smart people know that your GS means nothing when it comes to skill.<br />
<br />
sigh.. you are an idiot. <br />
<br />
I feel dumber for even having to read your ramblings.<br />
<br />

<br />
actually raid leading has been easier. I run partial pug raids all the time and having gear score as a handy addon has definitely helped filling the last few spots. I do know the fights like the back of my hand and you you still need people in good gear to do the job. <br />
<br />
&quot;No, it just means that they have spent more time farming badges. I can be decked out in all t10 by now but it does not mean I know how to get out of fire in a timely manner.&quot;<br />
<br />
That's fine, because a person who's decked out in t10 has atleast bothered to deck himself in t10 instead of the person who's didn't even bother to try and is sitting around in Dalaran with 4.5gs waiting to be carried. A person who's geared, generally, has atleast put forth an effort in gearing himself. He may or may not know all the fights, may or may not have the reaction time, but atleast he or she is useable and teachable. That shows that he or she is atleast trying. <br />
<br />
&quot;Smart people know that your GS means nothing when it comes to skill.&quot;<br />
<br />
Yeah, and there's a good way to determine skill before inviting them to the raid how? How did you think raids were run back then before GS? You sound like a person who's never lead a raid in your life. Raid leaders have to inspect every person for gear to see whether or not they will be geared enough for the fight. I don't care how skilled at that point. The first check is whether or not they are geared enough. Before seeing how well they play, skill isn't shown. GS is a useful tool that saves time. Instead of having to total up the equipment lvls with a calculator, a mod does that for me which lets me know aproximately what their stats look like. <br />
<br />
Now you're probably the guy lying about your &quot;skills.&quot; I've had plenty of random strangers trying to convince me that they're bad ass and skilled with their 4.1k gs. They may be right, but I'm not going to take that risk. I rather go with the random stranger with the higher GS and hope that he's as skilled as his gear to save time. <br />
<br />
Now if that &quot;skilled&quot; player got off his butt and actually get some better gear then that'd be better. But again, I'm going to be skeptical of him and not believe him when he claims he has good skills.<br />
<br />
Gearscore hasn't changed any of that. It's a tool of convenience and speeds up the process of pugging. I'm not in a competitive raiding guild but I've been able to work around it. <br />
<br />
You should not hate gearscore if you actually know how to use it.</div></div><hr />
