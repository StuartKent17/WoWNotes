Legion Mob Health Cap<br />
Ah but the most impressive thing about all this mobs is: they have over 2.1 billion hp. Congratz.<br />
<br />
With no squish this expansion they HAD to fix that. Many raid bosses will break that number and they don't want them to have to heal 4x during EVERY encounter now <br />
Old max: 2,147,483,647 <br />
New max: Over 9 Quadrillion <br />

Demon Hunter Order Hall Feedback<br />
As far as missions go, I find that my companions can not keep up with the level requirement of new missions as I progress through them. Despite sending them on all of the missions available as they pop up (which has only been 1-2 per day at a maximum), the first two companions I recruited are still at level 101, yet all of the new missions I'm receiving through the table are 103 and higher (I'm currently 107). They are unable to complete these quests and are also so much lower in level that they can't even benefit from &quot;failure&quot; experience for some of them.<br />
<br />
I think either the experience needed to level companions needs to be reduced or there needs to be more low-level (100-102) missions thrown in daily for you to be able to get them up to speed. Both, preferably.<br />
Thanks for the feedback. This will be adjusted in a future patch to ensure you don't see levels that are too far out of your followers level. In addition, we will be spreading out the mission levels themselves so there are a few more lower level ones for your followers to be sent on.

Druid Artifact Order Hall Feedback<br />
Sister Lillith won't allow for more Treants to be recruited after the 1st one for quest. Next portion of mission quest incompletable without a treant to boost success rate. This was an issue on alpha for druids and shamans halls<br />
We are looking into a fix for this and other issues related to not seeing missions and such. We understand this is frustrating and appreciate your help. Hopefully we can get you back on track.

The mandatory ice spells Fire mages hafta take. Can we get glyphs at least? And a fire option on the one all-ice talent tier?<br />
Haha, I've played a fire mage since vanilla, got yelled at a lot in Molten Core Always wanted a fire barrier, maybe someday! (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/729892710115512321))<br />
Hahaha, I joined in BC. Had similar problems. XD Al'ar.... Great googly moogly, a Fire Barrier would be rad.<br />
Issue is often: If you're facing another player in PvP, and their spell can look like 9 things, it's much harder to play. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/729893869744087041))<br />
<br />
I am really excited for how Unholy Deathknights are looking. One step closer to a true Necromancer.<br />
The new class anims are insanely cool, I don't usually point out individuals, but it's been RAD having Jay Wilson on the team. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/729888865851314176))<br />

Was it intentional that Fists of Fury now requires 1-hand weapons? I can understand aesthetic but not leveling.<br />
Yes. Windwalkers are intended to use only one-handed weapons now. Other changes will be made to account for this. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/730124085103976448))<br />

Actually I just checked and it's showing as the full price for me too, with Amazon Prime. However, when I pre-ordered the Legion CE it did the same thing, but the discount was still applied in the cart, so this will probably act the same way.
