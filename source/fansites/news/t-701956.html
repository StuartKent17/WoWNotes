Patch 3.3.3 - PTR Notes Update 
The PTR 3.3.3 Notes. Blood Queen Lana'thel is getting slightly changed and most of the glyph changes reported last week here are now official. Nothing else really interesting in the patch as far as I can see. 
 
This build is a release candidate, expect the patch on March 23 if everything goes well on PTRs.

Community Interviews: The Arena Master<br />
We've added yet another in-depth interview with one of World of Warcraft's millions of players for our five-year anniversary site. Luek from U.S. realm The Underbog shares his views on his last five years of dynamic and fluctuating gameplay focuses, particularly with regard to PvP, and provides some insight on where he sees himself once Cataclysm arrives. Check out the anniversary page for our full discussion.<br />

Debuffs and Dispells<br />
Really though, we don't think the answer is to have a continuing arms race of dispels and dispel protection. This is why we've been so reluctant to implement a DK change in the first place, especially one that we ideally won't need in the future. The way things are headed, one could easily imagine the 4.0 glyph or talent that says &quot;Your dispels now dispel stuff that normally can't be dispelled&quot; and the 5.0 version that says &quot;No, really, nothing can dispel your debuffs now,&quot; and the 6.0 one that said &quot;Just kidding. You can dispel everything again.&quot;<br />
<br />
We like the general concept of dispels as a counter. Making a good decision to spend resources (including GCDs) based on what another player is doing is what allows players to win because of their skill and not just because of their gear. The problem is that dispels were designed around (antiquated) PvE content such as Molten Core, where spamming dispels was something we asked you to do frequently. A better world would be one in which a dispel was a meaningful choice, meaning they would have a real mana cost and require you to actually push a button. There needs to be a cost for dispelling at the wrong time, just as there's a cost for using your trinket or Ice Block at the wrong time. If we make this change, we'd balance the PvE encounters accordingly, such as asking you to occasionally dispel big curses (or whatever) instead of constantly remove spammy, aggravating ones.

<br />
Bind on Account Emblems?<br />
We currently don't plan to do this as we feel it makes sense to run a couple of normal dungeons (possibly) on the character you'd like to gear up and then run heroics until your heart is content. <br />
<br />
[...] It's true that a main character can pile up a bunch of triumph/frost emblems at this point and not be too sure what to do with them. You could always make some gold via epic gems though - that will empty out your stores pretty fast.<br />
<br />
We mainly just want to try and keep players focused on the idea of playing a character they want to gear up and not allow their one main character to take care of a whole set of alts. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/23767538904-triumph-not-boa-okay-how-about.html))<br />
<br />
Overpowered combat ratings in WotLK<br />
As players above pointed out, the ratings would have worked fine had we not introduced extra item levels of gear to support the heroic modes of the last three tiers. Now we could have nerfed your ratings then, and maybe we should have, but that would have felt pretty harsh. Maybe Icecrown Radiance felt harsh enough that we should have done that. You can also argue that we should have guessed or at least planned in the possible addition of extra tiers. Maybe we'll do that in the future. Our model though is that player stats stop advancing from level and start advancing solely from gear at the level cap. We need some target for our combat ratings because they are expressly for the purpose of preventing players from maxxing out every stat with enough gear. Having creatures in later tiers scale along with your gear is one way that we're exploring. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/23767557794-just-get-rid-of-dodge-and-parry-altogether.html))<br />
<br />
Gear Scaling<br />
Ni, I think you're just talking about a different kind of experience. The way RPGs traditionally work is that you defeat the monsters to get better gear to challenge more powerful monsters. The goal, typically, isn't to get so powerful that the monsters are no longer a challenge. Now I understand that seeing your dodge number actually go down might be a bummer, but that's because you're looking at a percentage and not the rating (which only goes up). If we expressed health as a percentage relative to the damage done by a boss, it would behave the same way -- go down with every new tier, then start to go back up again.<br />
<br />
Currently, your health and armor go up, but the more powerful monsters in later dungeons hit harder. It's not that they are less of a threat to you than earlier monsters, and in many case the opposite true. It's more that you couldn't even have a hope of facing them without having amassed all of the armor you have. We're just talking about doing the same thing with other stats. It doesn't make sense that you avoid Saphiron 30% of the time, but avoid Sindragosa (who is supposed to be a much more powerful opponent and has the stats to prove it) 60% of the time. In the same way, the mage shouldn't be critting the more powerful opponent more than the weaker opponent. It just does strange things to the game, where the later bosses have to hit so much harder to make up for the fact that you're avoiding them more, which ironically (but mathematically) means that your avoidance is less valuable since it doesn't actually keep you alive.<br />
<br />
Really all we're talking about here is the distinction between absolute and relative differences. Bosses in higher tiers shouldn't be relatively easier to avoid. In fact, the opposite is arguably true. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/23767557794-just-get-rid-of-dodge-and-parry-altogether.html))<br />
<br />
Tanking<br />
AE Tanking<br />
Yeah, we'd basically agree with that. The risk should be that the tank will die, not that the tank can't hold aggro. However I have to caveat that because otherwise any time anyone ever fails to hold aggro for whatever reason they'll blame it on their tools instead of taking some responsibility for hitting the right button or gearing correctly. Threat still needs to matter as a mechanic<br />
<br />
And without launching into class warfare again, we think the paladin is a little too good in the AE department so we'd rather bring them down than bring everyone else up. You also need to compare tanks at the Naxx level, not the Icecrown level for purposes of threat.<br />
<br />
Put succinctly, imagine all 4 tanks tank groups about as well as a warrior tanked groups in Naxx, but that the mobs hit harder and AE damage was a little lower such that you wanted to CC and single target more of the pulls (but not every pull -- there is still a place for Blizzarding them all down). That's the goal. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/23767608815-please-do-away-with-faceroll-aoe-tanking.html))<br />
<br />
Tanking Gear and Gauntlets of the Iron Furnace (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/45310/gauntlets-of-the-iron-furnace/)<br />
The item in question is the infamous armor pen tank gloves. At the time, players were like &quot;Um, is this an error?&quot; Since then, a few tanks have asked us why there weren't some dps stats to choose from in Icecrown on tank gear.<br />
<br />
Really though it's part of the same issue I mentioned above. We don't want every piece of gear to look the same. We don't want everything that isn't &quot;best in slot&quot; to be dismissed or sharded. I don't know that we can get to a world where we put crit and haste on tanking plate, but man, it would be nice for the variety, and dps stats are more useful on tanking gear than they are on healing gear.<br />
<br />
When I tanked in BC, I used a dps tanking weapon for the threat. I can't imagine that is widely done these days (I at least never see it) because single-target threat isn't much of an issue, and even if it was, the risk of dying to burst damage is of greater concern. Maybe we have to make all tanking gear (save druid leather obviously) only focus on survival stats and the threat and dps just come for free (except for druids who would then be OP) but that's a little unfortunate. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/23767557794-just-get-rid-of-dodge-and-parry-altogether.html))<br />
<br />
Avoidance and RNG<br />
I just disagree with that. When I used Moroes' Lucky Pocket Watch and dodged a whole bunch of hits, I felt awesome. I don't think the same item would feel as cool today, but it was awesome in early BC. I can remember a few times when the healer was down but I managed to avoid several hits in a row and we beat the boss. Is that a great gearing strategy for beating a boss? Not really. But the nice thing about random numbers is how much fun it can be when they do roll in your favor (see Las Vegas).<br />
<br />
[...] Of course. Part of the challenge to you as a player is to overcome bad luck (or maximize good luck). When RNG is minimized, then it's just a math problem. A savvy healer could step into a fight and pretty quickly know if they are going to have the throughput to keep you alive hit to hit and the staying power to keep doing it throughout the fight. Nothing that happens during the fight is going to change that, so all of the decisions are made in the preparation phase (gearing and choosing talents) and not when you're actually up in front of the boss. There is a reason (nearly) all role-playing games keep what is essentially that d20 roll as a key part of the combat mechanics.<br />
<br />
The opposite extreme is problematic also. When the effects of RNG are so overwhelming that it feels like the decisions you make are irrelevant, then you're not really playing a game -- you're just spinning a roulette wheel. I'd point to things like small chances for random stuns as an example where RNG had too large an influence.<br />
<br />
What I am cautioning up above is sometimes players slip into the meta-game mentality of &quot;I would be a better tank if I didn't have to contend with RNG, therefore Blizzard should remove RNG.&quot; RNG serves an important purpose.

Ghoul and Unholy Blight in PvP<br />
We left the ghoul as an Unholy focus because not every player wants to have a pet. We already have two mandatory pet classes in the game.<br />
<br />
We want to see how the Unholy Blight change plays out. We realize it offers more PvP viability for Unholy than the other two specs, though to be fair, Unholy was already a lot more common in PvP. We didn't want to implement three distinct mechanics of disease resistance just to see what stuck, because then it felt like we'd have to support them all forever instead of iterating on a single one that we like. If the Unholy Blight model works, then it's something we'd consider giving to all DKs in the long-term.

Well i was under the impression that the issue with vanish in PvP was that raged things(pets too) calculate the hit at the end of cast time, and apply it at the end of flight time, you also cannot CloS a shadowbolt mid air. The chnage that would have to happen is that the dmg/effects of ranged attacks needs to be sorted out when it connects with the target. This would open stuff up though like the the AP pryoblast getting reflected after it is in the air. Pets just need to be treated as NPC's and not ranged attacks. so like a mob, &quot;oh hey it's gone, i wonder where it went, ohh well i'll go back to doing something else now.&quot; would fix 90% of my pvp issues with vanish.<br />
<br />
In PvE i'd just like for vanish to keep me out of combat as long as i don't take dmg. So if i pop it was the tank and a pally healer left up, 45seconds later when they die the mobs don't turn into heat seeking missiles and come kill me. This would seem to be done by simply making vanish have a &quot;remove combat&quot; pulse every .25 seconds for the duration of the buff. No immunities, no dmg reduction. If the PvE rogue id dumb enough to pop it while standing in fire, too bad. The way it is we can already vanish immune things in PvE, Saurfangs mark for example.</div></div><hr />

If things were calculated when they landed than a mage could PoM/Pyro and THAN click AP/trinkets/etc before it lands and we would be back to mages insta gibbing. It's not a trivial fix for many reasons. Also what happens if a mage were to shoot a fireball and die before it landed? whats modifiers would that fireball take and would it do damage in your scenario?</div></div><hr />

This change would break multiple spec-defining game mechanics, such as the frost mage's shatter combo.

I can't think of any other specs that use the mechanic of casting an instant after a spell with flight time to exploit a bonus on the target. I could be wrong, but as far as Ik now that just affects mages and Blizzard admits it's a bug that worked out, maybe they should fix rogues And mages.</div></div><hr />

Perhaps the reason there hasn't been any paladin changes as of yet, is because paladins don't need any changes atm? You'll find, the 4.0 patch will contain dozens of changes for ALL classes.</div></div><hr />

You also need to compare tanks at the Naxx level, not the Icecrown level for purposes of threat.<br />
Put succinctly, imagine all 4 tanks tank groups about as well as a warrior tanked groups in Naxx, but that the mobs hit harder and AE damage was a little lower such that you wanted to CC and single target more of the pulls (but not every pull -- there is still a place for Blizzarding them all down). That's the goal&quot;<br />
<br />
Fuck off!<br />
<br />
If I wanted to play a Warrior I would. Stop fucking with our class. Pally's are AOE tanks. <br />
Every day there's some bullshit post from Blizzard about NOT wanting all 4 tanks to be the same. How about they actually design trash mobs that require CC'ing and then deal with the tanking issues if there are any.<br />
They design a whole raid instance with undead mobs then wonder why Pallies are doing so well.<br />
There are always going to be groups that over gear an instance and thus the trash who will be able to AOE regardless. However when I started raiding in Ulduar we had to CC some parts because we were playing it safe and undergeared for it.</div></div><hr />

Correction: You were AOE tanks back in TBC. There are no AOE tanks anymore, Blizzard is making all tanks equally capable of AOE tanking but doing it in different ways. The Paladin method is currently overpowered, way too easy and needs changing.</div></div><hr />

The Paladin method is fine the way it is - give the other tanks the &quot;different ways&quot; better. <br />
&quot;The Paladin method is currently spot on, easy to control and the other tanks need changing&quot; - there i fixed your last sentence for you.<br />
<br />
We've had the same abilities since forever but because people are now out of the CC mindset, rather Blizzard has forgotten how to created CCable content, pallies start getting shat on all over again.<br />
<br />
It happens with every class that all of a sudden comes together perfectly with the tools they have been given and then everyone qq's the fuck out of it and then down comes the nerf bat. <br />

An &quot;AOE tank&quot; is a tank that exclusively AOE tanks. Paladins were known as AOE tanks back in tbc because it was a fact that Consecration made it ridiculously easy.<br />
<br />
<br />
The Paladin method is fine the way it is - give the other tanks the &quot;different ways&quot; better. <br />
Blizzard has stated that they'd rather nerf the overpowered status of a single class than buff everyone else. It happened to hunters &amp; death knights and it's finally happening to paladins now.<br />
<br />
<br />
We've had the same abilities since forever but because people are now out of the CC mindset, rather Blizzard has forgotten how to created CCable content, pallies start getting shat on all over again.<br />
You've had the same abilities forever because there were different attitudes with regard to 'balance' back in vanilla and tbc. The game has moved on and so must you.<br />
<br />
<br />

Paladins have always been too good at aoe tanking. Ask anyone who did heroic Shattered Halls with a paladin tank.<br />
<br />
<br />
Put some effort into the content and stop homogenising everything.<br />
Many paladins abilities have been overpowered for a long time and it's about time the class was fixed. I have an almost-80 paladin and I welcome it.</div></div><hr />

Who said anything about buffing DK's, I said that we make pretty good AOE tanks. You really should read what is posted before nerd raging. And I don't PVP and I don't care about PVP, but I'm pretty sure DK's are not faceroll in PVP, actually from what I've read from just about everyone who does PVP that there are classes preferable to DK's because they do more dmg and have about the same utilities.

First, it is a buff to Unholy not DKs as a whole. Second, Unholy is a disease spec, so no diseases means no damage at all (in the sense of threatening damage).

Consecration, as has been stated many times, is not the be all and end all of paladin tanking and I don't really care what the opinion was way back when and I had to play healer as every other spec was broken.<br />
<br />
So they have a class that is performing as it is supposed to - and it's over powered. That's the kind of backward thinking we have to expect from Blizzard as they can't seem to develop or design content like they used too. They won't design bosses for specific tanking classes yet they don't want to get rid of 4 tanks and have 1 yet they don't like tanks to have different abilities. oooooooo lets go back to the times when developers specifically wanted Warriors to be MT's as has been publicly stated - good times!<br />
<br />
So the games moved on - I have no problem with that and I love current content. What annoys me is that whole raid instances are geared to favour Paladins ie DUH mobs - the qq starts and we get bashed - that's pathetic.<br />

&quot;As it's supposed to&quot; is an opinion. That doesn't mean it's going to be right.<br />
<br />
<br />

They want all 4 tanking classes to be viable to tank every boss.<br />
If one tank makes things a little easier that's fine.<br />
If one tank makes it as stupid as death knight tanks did on Sarth +3 or General Vezax then something needs to happen.<br />
<br />
<br />
So the games moved on - I have no problem with that and I love current content. What annoys me is that whole raid instances are geared to favour Paladins ie DUH mobs - the qq starts and we get bashed - that's pathetic.<br />
Being full of undead mobs was never intended to automatically favor paladins. It's an entire continent full of undead, we knew paladins were going to be good in wrath but they were never intended to be as rediculous as it's becoming.<br />
<br />
<br />
There is no such thing as &quot;too good&quot;. I ran HC SH on my lock with my warrior mate many times and he was excellent - i also attempted it with fail pallies - it's all relative.<br />
I'm amazed that you found &quot;fail pallies&quot;. I never encountered one through the whole of burning crusade when it came to tanking (and I pugged SH heroic).<br />
<br />
<br />
Having an &quot;almost 80&quot; - sorry but your opinion counts for very little due to your lack of experience - I got a lvl 1 &lt;insert whatever your main spec is&gt; and it's overpowered and needs to be nerfed - everyone says so.<br />
I'll expand on that, then.<br />
I raided through burning crusade from Kara to BT (all the way to Illidan) as a warlock and had the free time while spamming shadowbolt and curse of shadows to watch first hand how stupidly overpowered paladins were. The situation has only gotten worse (and it hasn't been due to the thousands of undead).<br />
I rerolled to a death knight tank when wrath of the lich king hit and tanked everything from Naxx to ToC before rerolling to a Hunter due to the massive hits I was taking compared to the druid, paladin and warrior tanks in my guild.<br />
I'm currently leveling what will be my 6th level 80, my paladin, and the 5th I'll raid with.<br />
I've had more than enough time to see that paladins are far too good at aoe threat compared to druids, warriors and death knights. They need a nerf.<br />
<br />

If Paladin's were the main tank's of choice in all WF guilds then I would agree there are changes that need to be made. They ain't so there isn't. <br />
If a WF guild needs a paladin tank then they already have one in backup. They will switch him in if it's needed. Paladin tanks were used extensively in the Anub HM attempts due to how easy they made controlling, collecting and maintaining aggro on the adds.<br />
<br />
<br />
We already lost 2K HP recently.<br />
Let me know when that's a significant dent to paladin health.</div></div><hr />

All 4 tanks are viable to tank every boss - building threat on a single target is not an issue. Blizzard, and you, appear to be complaining about tanking trash - not really the reason we're in a raid in the first place. TOC has no trash and there was more crying than i've ever seen.<br />
<br />
How does undead mobs NOT make it automatically favour pallies? we have specific spells FOR undead. Had the same QQ in Naxx - pissed me off then as well. We've had over a year of Wrath - how is it &quot;becoming&quot; ridiculous? So we can tank trash slightly better than the other tanks - WOW!<br />
<br />
I've found fail EVERYTHING. The biggest reason my Pally is my main is I can have some control over an instance and not waste everyones time being shit.<br />
<br />
Lucky you found 1 of the 2 or 3 people on your server that persevered in BC to try and tank as a pally because it was broken for a very long time. The only time we came into our own was MH tanking the waves. And even then our guild wouldn't let a pally tank as they were &quot;crap and get back to healing&quot;.<br />
So due to pallies having good AOE threat - they are due a nerf? <br />
<br />
No they are not. This is all knee jerk reaction to Blizzard providing packs of mobs that CAN be AOE'd. I've gone into ICC on one of my other chars with druid's, warriors and DK's tanking and we get through the content with the same ease when we run with pallies. If Blizzard actually created trash that required CC then this would be a non issue. <br />
Stop blaming lack of design ability by Blizzard on 1 class that can do the job they were designed to do better than another class that also has crap AOE abilities. Fix the crap AOE abilities or provide trash that needs to be CC'd.<br />
<br />
WF guild don't have pallies as MT's as they are not needed. your opinion that if they are needed they have one in backup proves the point. They are again excelling at trash clearance but not used to MT. <br />
<br />
Nerf our AOE abilities and they will likely break the class again. We are not anywhere near the same situation as DK tanks were. At the moment we are in a great place in the game. Every tank can tank every boss. It really is bring the player not the class and they want to screw with us again.<br />
<br />
2K HP loss - is 2K HP loss. Whether you think that is significant is beside the point. The fact we got an HP loss in the first place is the concern. It did nothing to alter the balance in the game whatsoever. All it did was pander to the Warriors who were once again qqing.</div></div><hr />

From a Moonkin PoV, what in the name of all that is logical and sane are you complaining about? ??? You've got it made brother, be grateful you have a chance at surviving in anyway in pvp, let alone the ability to do ANYTHING without being locked down by cc and beaten like the purple horned HK pinata that you are, and then when you ask for a helping hand you get a buff to starfall (yay pve dps buff) and then told to respec feral. <br />

<br />
As was stated earlier in this thread Paladins have not had a niche of AE tanking this entire expansion. AoE tanking on Paladin has been really easy this expansion compared to the other tank classes. I'm not saying the other classes have a hard time at it, I'm just saying that it is much easier for a Paladin. The 3.2.2 patch introduced the Cleave mechanic to Seal of Command. On my Paladin I went from having an easy time of AoE tanking to having an insanely easy time and also bumping up my DPS by 1000 on trash packs.<br />
<br />
I imagine the SoC change was intended to help out Ret Pallies on their AoE but had the unintended side effect of buffing Prot Pallies DPS and threat output by a silly amount. They haven't announced their intended changes but if it were me I'd make SoC only usable while wielding a 2HD weapon and also change Hammer of the Righteous to only apply the seal to the main target. This would most likely bring the TPS on trash packs to a more even level across all tanks.</div></div><hr />

Honestly, calling the old shield block a &quot;minor survivability skill&quot;. Saying that DPS stats on tanking gear are more desireable for tanks rather then for healers? Saying the new shield block is more interesting to use compared to the other one?<br />

I'm glad to see the new tank changes but I disagree with people calling for pally AOE nerfs or those that complain about pallys having an easier time in Icecrown. Of course they have an easier time,deal with it.</div></div><hr />
