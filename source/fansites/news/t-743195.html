Cataclysm - Reforging in Beta<br />
Reforging was added to the official patch notes after last build's update and people keep asking how it works on beta servers. The answer is simple, it doesn't. The UI just doesn't work and it will most likely be included in the next build, the only thing in-game for the moment is the Thaumaturge who will reforge items for you. <br />
<br />

Then Boubouille broke the guild tho... :(<br />
Guild changes are indeed very nice, easy to manage everything. <br />
Some small bugs occur like: <br />
- zoning will trigger a chat message about learning 1st guild talent all the time. You have learned Fast Track (Level 1)<br />
- guild bank gets stuck after putting stuff in or trying to get it out. <br />
<br />
Gunmist - I have no clue how many members guild window will show now, but my bet is everyone in it. There is not real use for that, since guilds are not that big now.</div></div><hr />

I think disc is keeping the 3% damage reduction and holy the 10% physical damage redction. Probably not mentioned since they're not &quot;buffs&quot; like these but more proc based and not guaranteed to be up all time.</div></div><hr />

It makes no sense having shamans, druid and so on doing lower dps than mages, locks, rogues and hunters when they don't provide unique buffs. You do a raid with tanks, healers and dps not with tanks, healers, pure dps and hybrid dps..</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raqubor</div><div class="date">2010-07-28, 09:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wait...what?From where did reforging come up, is this going to be a new profession or not, it looks pretty good.<br />
<br />
Where were you the last 1,5 years?<br />
At first they wanted to make LWs BSs Tailors be able to reforge the according type of armor.<br />
You can only reforge secondary stats and spirit, so no STR, STM, AGI and so on.<br />
Since it was hard to implement and would have made professions unbalanced, they made an NPC for this.<br />
<br />
Other stuff:<br />
SV hunter buffs: 20% MELEE haste, and REPLENISHMENT. What the fork! Hunter = Ranged | Replenishment = Mana != Focus...<br />
Every spec that brings a buff is good for itself... This is seriously stupid.<br />
<br />
Edit: Give the 20% Melee speed to Assasin rogues, and give SV 8% spell damage (with arcane shot, fire traps, explosive shot, poison shots and black arrow it fits better). Remove Replenishment from SV, because without it still 4 classes will bring it.<br />
And then we still have expose weakness, which i think... will be a random debuff most useful on the target, so it will be balanced that way.<br />
<br />
Edit2: Or even better: Merge ranged weapon haste with melee haste, and everything is fine. (xcept replenishment)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
When A guild has a couple thousand 80's, I think it will be very hard to show everyone in it. Hell, even the armory has trouble showing everyone in my guild.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Radak</div><div class="date">2010-07-28, 09:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">@Gunmist: I know how you feel. My guild has the same problem.<br />
The solution we currently use if having a second guild with the less played lower lvl alts to not exceed the annoying 500 player limit (I know not a real limit but the UI starts bugging then and not showing players).<br />
To link the 2 guild chats with each other we use the guild2guild addon. However we had some problems with the officerchat with this addon because if in another guild someone's alt is a officer he could see the officers chat unless he disabled the addon. And we didn't really like the fact that anyone could have access to our officer chat that way.<br />
<br />
The solution to that was that our guildmaster wrote a private addon that uses the standard wow chatchannels (the ones you can make with /join 'whatever') but will auto join with a set password and announces who your main is (normally if you have a channel with a password it will NOT auto join you until you enter the password and this addon helps to work around that)<br />
<br />
So the end result: I totally agree with you and really hope they remove that damn limit so our alts can lvl with the guildperks and building rep while lvling instead of having to do it at 85.</div></div><hr />

I believe windfury is going to be affecting ranged weapon speed too, in which case hunters bringing it is fine. Replenishment is still weird though.<br />

<br />
I fear that with it balancing healer mana will be a lot harder and eventually they will go back to heal spamming instead of conserving mana.<br />
The reason mana worked in classic was that mana was the responsibility of the healer, noone else (ok, besides on use effects like innervate and mana tides).<br />
Or nerf it to the ground - allthough then I dont see why they add it in the first place. Shadowpriests and Ret paladins raid spots need to be justified through their damage and not through an uninteresting buff that doesnt effect their rotation in any way. Survival hunters and destro locks also dont want to have a reason why their damage has to be sub par.<br />
<br />
But most importantly this buff is way too dangerous for the idea of bringing mana conservation back and thus making healing and gearing fun again.<br />

(...)<br />
<br />
This is actually a very biased way to look at the buffs because no class comes to a raid with a 31/31/31 specc and thus cannot provide all those buffs at once.<br />
<br />
The list would look more like this:<br />
<br />
Shaman:<br />
Elemental: 9<br />
Enhancement: 8<br />
Resto: 7<br />
<br />
Warrior<br />
Arms: 8<br />
Fury: 7<br />
Protection: 5<br />
<br />
Paladin<br />
Retribution: 7<br />
Protection: 6<br />
Holy: 4<br />
<br />
Mage<br />
Arcane: 4<br />
Fire: 4<br />
Frost: 6<br />
<br />
Warlock<br />
Destruction: 6<br />
Demo: 5<br />
Affliction: 5<br />
<br />
Druid<br />
Feral: 7<br />
Balance: 4<br />
Resto: 2<br />
<br />
Death Knight<br />
Blood: 4<br />
Frost: 4<br />
Unholy: 3<br />
<br />
Rogue<br />
Assassination: 4<br />
Sub: 5<br />
Combat: 4<br />
<br />
Hunter<br />
Marks: 3<br />
Survival: 4<br />
Beast: 3<br />
<br />
Priest<br />
Disc: 1<br />
Holy: 1<br />
Shadow: 4<br />
<br />
(I went through the list very quickly and might have miscounted some of the buffs, so feel free to correct me. I also counted the &quot;possible&quot; and &quot;probable&quot; buffs into the respective speccs)</div></div><hr />

Other stuff:<br />
SV hunter buffs: 20% MELEE haste, and REPLENISHMENT. What the fork! Hunter = Ranged | Replenishment = Mana != Focus...<br />
Every spec that brings a buff is good for itself... This is seriously stupid.<br />
<br />
Edit: Give the 20% Melee speed to Assasin rogues, and give SV 8% spell damage (with arcane shot, fire traps, explosive shot, poison shots and black arrow it fits better). Remove Replenishment from SV, because without it still 4 classes will bring it.<br />
And then we still have expose weakness, which i think... will be a random debuff most useful on the target, so it will be balanced that way.<br />
<br />
Edit2: Or even better: Merge ranged weapon haste with melee haste, and everything is fine. (xcept replenishment)<br />
<br />
I could easily be wrong, but it may be that &quot;Melee Haste&quot; is misnamed and should be &quot;Attack Haste&quot;, meaning everything except spell casts are faster. The replenishment has to be a bug though, makes no sense..</div></div><hr />

No, they're removing it so that casters have a consistent hit cap to aim for that doesn't depend on who's in the raid. I assume Heroic Presence is going away for the same reason.</div></div><hr />

It could have been the moment for a druid revenge, and instead we are getting nerfed, talking by a moonkin point of view: Make a raid with a druid healer, a fire mage, a lock, a ele shaman and we are useless, expecting to be like always down them also in the potential dps.<br />

I don't think it is, since Goblins were given the haste buff so the Horde had something similar to heroic pres. Also, heroic Pres effects casters and melee alike so all you have to do is have 2 to 5 Draenei in your raid</div></div><hr />

The reason that hybrids get the hybrid tax IS NOT because they bring a unique buff but because you have the option of, at any time, switching to another role other than dps. Thats why you have the hybrid tax.<br />

The hybrid tax is something Blizzard is open to discuss each expansion. They even did an experiment with feral druids letting them actually compete on dps meters with pure dps and to be honest I didn't see a huge increase of feral druids because of it.<br />
<br />
There's also no benefit for having a tank/heal spec past the (off-)healing, (off-)tanking raid spots. If there is no raid in the game that requires more than 3 tanks, any tanking dual spec past the 3rd tank is irrelevant. Same for healers if you'd never need more than 7 healers, why would 10 people with a healing spec be of any use? It's just a relic of vanilla that makes no sense.<br />
The reason people roll pure dps classes should be because they like the class or just don't want to tank/heal, either way hybrids being competitive in dps shouldn't matter.<br />
<br />
And lastly there's a second &quot;hybrid tax&quot; in the game. It's in the form of a dual spec you can't use for pvp, 2 (3, sometimes even 4) sets of gear you need to spend dkp/emblems on and the cost of enchanting all that gear with the best/most expensive stuff.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm not even sure the hybrid tax is still around today. Every class is capable of competitive damage (competitive, not chart-topping). <br />
<br />
And that second hybrid tax you're talking about is a requirement for being able to switch roles. That's like a mage complaining about having to keep his main set in top enchants and gems. You don't have to have separate sets, that's a bonus for the class.</div></div><hr />

sure.. as a fury warrior i could switch to tank.. wait my off spec is arms for pvping.. wait i didn't gear and gem to tank, i geared to dps.. wait i can't switch in the middle of combat.. so no.. i can't switch roles at any time, and if i did my raid leader would probably be pissed because the only reason why he brought me was because of my dps.<br />
<br />
the problem with the &quot;higher theoretical dps&quot; argument is a lot of &quot;pure's&quot; think they should be at the top of dps no matter what gear they have, no matter what skill they have, no matter who the other dps is. you know how many times i've been bitched out by mages/warlocks/hunters/rogues with barely 3k gearscore addon gearscore's in 5-mans and pug raids? complaining that i with a 3/4 BiS 6k gear score should have lower dps than them since i'm not a pure dps class? more times than i could count on all of the hands in china. and it looks like the devs are starting to listen to them quite honestly.</div></div><hr />

Seems like they're listening to you, actually. With buffs more shared, you don't *have* to bring a shaman or paladin for their awesome buffs. You can bring them for being awesome people, awesome players, or both. Whichever your guild is more inclined to do.</div></div><hr />

but you can't move primary stats. so your stuck with that stamina. on the bright note i believe a dev said that stamina and high health &quot;increase&quot; your dps..... these are the people that make our game. when stamina increases my attack power, crit rating, haste rating, or hell even my hit rating.. then that will be the day that stamina increases my dps. stamina does not increase my dps, it sustains it.. allowing me to dps longer instead of dieing to one of their wonderful &quot;everyone in the raid takes 20,000 damage every 5 seconds&quot; mechanics. and while i'm grateful for having nearly 50k health in ICC to live through sindragosa's crap. i'm not really too pleased about having 10% of all my dps primary, and secondary stats being turned into stamina. so no.. stamina does not increase my dps my beautiful snowflake developers... it's nerfing my dps.</div></div><hr />

sure... but they are also nerfing hybrids dps with a big stick this expansion. so pure's getting all of the hybrid buffs, plus an across the board nerf to hybrid class dps, equals why bring anyone other than pure's to dps? btw most real guilds do not bring someone because they are an awesome person. they bring them because they can put out 10k+ dps. if they happen to be an awesome person as well.. then that is just a bonus.<br />
<br />
that is the reality that we are in.. in game. you don't bring people for their personality, or for their &quot;i think i can i think i can i think i can&quot; attitude. you bring them to get shit done. you bring tanks because they have 80k-90k health, you bring healers because... well they are stupid, and you need to bring them anyways, and you bring dps because they can put out 13k dps.</div></div><hr />

I think Blizzard has stated that only the top 10 contributors in a guild are used for guild perks. So theoretically a guild with 10 active members will be no worse off than a guild with 200 active members. I hope that is in fact the case.</div></div><hr />

Those buffs aren't raid or party-wide anymore. My Draenei's Heroic Presense only affects my Draenei. Goblin Haste only affects Goblins. Worgen's +1% Crit (not damage, unless they are going to change it) only affects Worgen's, ect ect.<br />

It's a good thing Blizzard's policy regarding this is subject to change. Hopefully it will sooner rather than later. If a hybrid comes to dps, they come to dps, period. I don't mind a small difference, but not several thousand points worth like today. Dps-only classes provide far more incentives than they used to nowadays without actually having to role switch. Some hybrids like Priest actually have an alarmingly low amount. It's not an excuse anymore.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No. Becouse you don't need the buffs and those guys are awesome players, you tell them to reroll into USEFUL class that can actually do DPS<br />

Also if &quot;buffing classes&quot; like shammies are concearned that now they won't get to come to the raids they either raid with a bunch of tools or aren't very good and truely are only brought for the buff. I have never seen a good player not be invited to a 25 man raid because they already had the &quot;token shammy.&quot; I think this will finally make it to where the raids are composed with skilled players that can perform boss mechanics regardless of class. Now if they would only bring Attunment's back.</div></div><hr />

<br />
that is the reality that we are in.. in game. you don't bring people for their personality, or for their &quot;i think i can i think i can i think i can&quot; attitude. you bring them to get shit done. you bring tanks because they have 80k-90k health, you bring healers because... well they are stupid, and you need to bring them anyways, and you bring dps because they can put out 13k dps.<br />
<br />
Um, now I think you're trolling. Blizzard has never stated that they're nerfing hybrid dps &quot;across the board.&quot; You know, the first heroic LK25 kill used no mages? And they're a PURE dps class. I feel sorry for you if you feel forced to raid with assholes and bads because they have an awesome buff. Thankfully, Blizzard is getting rid of this attitude in cataclysm.<br />

I'm not going to, and no one should, force a player to reroll a class for progression. I will tell a mage to go arcane or fire over frost, but not a completely different class. <br />

<br />
Since rogues, shaman, druids, and hunters are getting 2 AP per agil, and casters are getting SP for int, it would have been too powerful of a buff.</div></div><hr />

<br />
until now, blizzard hasn't said 1 thing that really motivates guilds to do 25 mans<br />
<br />
so... some classes will get in trouble to fit on 10 mans, shamans probably but without a doubt i really don't see bringing priest to 10 mans<br />
<br />
holy is inferior to any other raid healing (in wolk)<br />
<br />
discipline will not be for raids in cata, shields costing alot of mana (said by a blue) and the promise that mana will be a problem in Cataclysm, this spec is clearly (with the new talents) a leveling spec only<br />
<br />
so in 10 man will not be any reason to bring a priest instead of a druid or a pala<br />
<br />
the same goes for some dps</div></div><hr />

Shaman 10<br />
Warrior 10<br />

Mage 9<br />
Warlock 9<br />
Druid 8<br />
Death Knight 7<br />

Hunter 4<br />
Priest 4<br />
<br />
I am aware that some are not listed yet, but it makes me wonder if they are going to try and level everything a little bit closer together.<br />
<br />
take into account that not every spec of each class has all buffs of the class first. wont fix everything, still needs work, but you have to take that into account before saying anything.</div></div><hr />

Probably one of the dumbest things I've ever read. Resto druids won't be for raids since they can't spam rejuv/WG on everyone since mana will matter more and they have talents that have them casting wrath. <br />
<br />
We're not even close to being done with beta. If cata was being released on Friday, I'd be worried.</div></div><hr />

Today pure dps is balance to dps without buffs so they will do more dps when in raid with buffers/hybrids<br />
Tomorow pure dps will bring buffs to raid so his dps have to be balance around with 100% up time buff so so hybrids will not be nerf but pure will be more balance with hybrida.<br />
<br />
Example:<br />
Elemental shaman probably have been balance to count with hero every fight he enter.<br />
Mage some fights dont have hero so they are balance to not count with that buff and when they have they do much more dmg then others.<br />
On cata mages have hero so their damage have to be balance with hero in mind because they will have hero for all fights like shaman have now.<br />

Funny you should mention that. Reminds me of one time that I signed up for an ICC 25 guild run, and we had too many people. After dropping people according to rank and/or hadn't sat out the previous week, we were left with one extra person. Now this remaining extra needed gear and dkp more than I did and, since I wasn't particularly feeling up to raiding that night, I volunteered to sit. The RL (who is also my GM) wouldn't have with it because &quot;we need bloodlust&quot;, as I was the only shaman in the raid. *sigh*<br />
<br />
In the end, the player I had volunteered to leave for got sat. I was unhappy with the outcome and looking back on it... I regret that I did not press the issue. (I can't recall if the above incident was the first time or not, but I feel it won't be the last.)</div></div><hr />

Where does it say that Blizzard balances classes based on what they can do by themselves? Are you saying that Blizzard balances dummy dps as apposed to what someone can do in a raid with full buffs? They've even said that they don't balance pvp for 1v1.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And that second hybrid tax you're talking about is a requirement for being able to switch roles. That's like a mage complaining about having to keep his main set in top enchants and gems. You don't have to have separate sets, that's a bonus for the class.<br />
<br />
Dps is not &quot;competitive&quot; unless it can actually compete. If you have no chance of being number one, then that's not competing. This &quot;requirement&quot; is entirely artificial due to so-called pure's excessive QQ at not being number one on the dps charts in every encounter. You made a hypocrite of yourself when you referred to the hybrid tax as a requirement for the ability to respec to a different role...and then following it up to say hybrids do not have to have separate sets. Which is it? The two are not mutually exclusive for &quot;hybrids&quot;. That's not a bonus at all when it comes with a penalty of making you a second-rate raider at your given role. Raid leaders don't excuse lower dps because you are a hybrid. If your raid is on the cusp of killing a dps check boss or beating a raid encounter....guess who is getting criticized or sat? (hint..it's the lowest dpsers..which almost by default will be hybrids due to this rediculous hybrid tax). Having an artificial limiter placed on your ability to compete at your given role is not fun...especially for a raider who will never get any chance at using anything other than a second dps offspec anyway due to lack of need for extra tanks. Dps is 100% about competing..and as such..the hybrid tax is the opposite of fairness...especially considering the hybrid tax only really applies to non-rogue melee dps vs all other dpsers.</div></div><hr />

If your raid leader is benching &quot;hybrids&quot; based solely on DPS charts (which I SERIOUSLY DOUBT- Most of the people that come up with these ludicrous hypothetical situations do so only because of insecurities about their own dps with no class parses to back up their claims), then maybe you should consider joining a different guild? Also, if your only concern as a hybrid is out dps'ing everyone else then maybe you should consider playing a pure class. The fun of playing a hybrid is the flexibility it provides. A healer goes down and you can heal. A tank DC's and you can switch to your tank spec. A healer gets aggro, and you can off tank for a bit to help out. The benefits are immeasurable in certain circumstances and a good raid leader knows this. Also, a good player, that plays a hybrid class, should know that recount isn't the only thing you should be thinking about.</div></div><hr />

<br />
the problem with the &quot;higher theoretical dps&quot; argument is a lot of &quot;pure's&quot; think they should be at the top of dps no matter what gear they have, no matter what skill they have, no matter who the other dps is. you know how many times i've been bitched out by mages/warlocks/hunters/rogues with barely 3k gearscore addon gearscore's in 5-mans and pug raids? complaining that i with a 3/4 BiS 6k gear score should have lower dps than them since i'm not a pure dps class? more times than i could count on all of the hands in china. and it looks like the devs are starting to listen to them quite honestly.<br />
<br />
The reason people are complaining about warrior dps is because it is currently artificially high as shown by world of logs parsing (For heroic ICC, warriors are top dps in 6 out of 12 fights) and blizz's own blue posts acknowledging as much. It's either that most warriors at the high end of gear are magically super dps'rs all of the sudden or something is off track. But to address your initial comment, you could actually pull some aggro away from a healer in a pinch and not get one shotted, if you weren't obsessively focused on recount that is. Unlike most of the people that play hybrid classes, most good raid leaders know the true benefits of bringing hybrids to a raid. Also, you can still respec you know? You can have a tank set and pvp set and dps set. On raid nights, spec to tank and dps (a tank may dc and then you can fill in) and spec to pvp when you pvp. Being a hybrid means being flexible, let the pures mindlessly drool over recount.</div></div><hr />

I find this logic a bit flawed.<br />
<br />
Let's be absolutely realistic here. A Enchancement Shaman for example is not going to be able to put out nearly enough healing to keep anyone alive in any sort of difficult raid encounter, and might actually wipe the raid if they tried to instead of squeezing out as much DPS as possible to finish the monster off, because as soon as any hybrid tries to step into another role their dps takes a nosedive, punishing them for stepping out of that role. It would be the same spetacularly bad scenario if a Ret paladin tried to set up to tank. Smaller encounters with more room for error would be a different case, but that's why they are considered easier.<br />
<br />
I don't like how there's this mindset that you shouldn't invite specific classes over another for certain buffs due to that being some type of unfair advantage, and then turn around and say it's ok to invite a class over another because they WILL be doing noticably more dps DESPITE equivalent gear and skill. I find that exremely hypocritical. It's the same unfair advantage wrapped in a different package, but one is ok and the other isn't.</div></div><hr />

The concept of hybrid means you should be capable of switching to a different role during an event/fight to make a difference. I play a balance druid. The idea that being a hybrid means I can switch to heal/bear mid-fight to save a situation is laughable at present. <br />
<br />
Heals are too weak (and mana consuming in the long run) to keep MT/OT up for long - there's a talent spec gap there. It's worse when you consider emergency tanking: to survive anything when going bear you need the abilities granted by talent spec and then the stats to back that up - stats we don't get on caster gear anymore (last of the multistat gear was back in classic) - so there's a spec and gear gap there.<br />
<br />
I think there's two things they could do: a) ditch the hybrid tax altogether (or apply it to every class that can dual spec into another role...); or, b) bring back multi-stat gear so hybrids can at least bridge one of the ever-widening gaps between spec and role to the point where we can survive/scrape by when doing it.</div></div><hr />
