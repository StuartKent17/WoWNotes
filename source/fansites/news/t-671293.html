Brewfest Extended<br />
Brewfest is a time of year where the focus is placed squarely on the celebration of fun and food. In order to give everyone enough time to truly experience this event (and after some fine tuning on the part of the event organizers), we will be extending the event two additional days. The festivities will end on October 5th at 11:59PM, so don’t miss it!</div></div><hr />

These 2 added days will actually increase your chance of getting the clothing, if you havent been a good boy and completed the daily's every day since the event went live.<br />
Cba doing the math atm but it might be possible to get Brew of the Month, all 3 pieces and the pet now while keeping the 3 pieces instead of selling em back.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Problem is exactly that I got those 200 tokens required for the membership form today. I should get 150 tokens more to even buy all clothing (350 marks total) and afterwards sell them back to get into brewclub.<br />
<br />
Now with 5 days remaining, I have to get 30 tokens per day to reach the 150 tokens more. Barking in city: 15 tokens, Dark Iron dwarf attacks: 10 tokens and ram racing about 14-26 tokens depending on lag, luck and other sh*t (like mispressing button which then unmounts you -.-). That makes grand total of 39-51 tokens per day which isn't too bad considering minimum amount (30). But only if I get those 200 tokens back if GM is kind :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
there is more than 1 quest per day.. oh wait europe<br />
but anyway il get my last achievement tomorow :P<br />
<br />
Advice : Wait until you have all your tokens, buy the set, go to dalaran, get drunk(, have sex if you want you have 2 hour), come back for a refound of your smelly set and get your pet/keg TADAA!!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Guildmate did the same thing, GM told him he couldnt refund the tokens because they cant remove the Brew of the Month achievment apparently and he has to wait until next year to finish the achievments</div></div><hr />

<br />
With respect, I already bought all three pieces of clothing, the brew of the month membership, and my pet this year. It is possible. <br />
<br />
-15 tokens from the barking quest<br />
-10 from defending against the dwarves<br />
-30+ from ram racing<br />
<br />
That's 55+ tokens per day, plus all the one time turn-ins.</div></div><hr />

Get drunk, dance, and get the achievement. Then sell back the clothes to get your tokens back. Get brew of the month, and might as well get the pet, too. 50 coins left over as spare change.

I bought the Brew of the Month thing, and today I had 350 tokens and bought the clothes. So from the start until now, I got 550 tokens. I don't care about it being extended, but why exactly are people complaining about it being too short? The Dailies took maybe a max 20 minutes (depending how long you last in ram racing) so there's no excuse for missing a day.</div></div><hr />

Well its same as in RL, some ppl tend to look how to go &quot;around&quot; stuff that is infront of them and some do them as intended. For me dont have problem with both, but going as it is suposed is what i usualy do.<br />

Beside, few /dance with clothes on after event is something ppl that do what you said wont be able to.<br />

-15 tokens from the barking quest<br />

-30+ from ram racing<br />
<br />
That's 55+ tokens per day, plus all the one time turn-ins. <br />
<br />
<br />
That's alliance calculation, horde gets 20 +/- 2 tokens from Ram racing (depending on the responsiveness of the apples &amp; goblin), and considering the European quest debacle, it's even harder to get the tokens, especially if you didn't start the event from the get-go. <br />
<br />
So those 2 days are welcome.</div></div><hr />

Am I reading that note about a hotfix wrong, or do I need to wait until a server restart or something?<br />
<br />
Edit: I failed at reading the line that said keep in mind that the realms may need to restart before the change goes in. /self congratulatory pat.</div></div><hr />

<br />
On a more serious note, a friend's guildie got hacked and would've failed Brewmaster because of the follow-up ban if it wasn't for the extension. Good news for him I guess.</div></div><hr />

US-Spinebreaker. Just checked - still no Abyssal Shatter. Probably have to wait till they restart the servers like mentioned.</div></div><hr />

Yes. I got it yesterday (Lightbringer US) sometime before noon my time (GMT -8)</div></div><hr />

I get max 16 tokens from ram racing. How do you get so many more? I see people saying they can get 50? ... So confused. My ram won't run that fast! lol</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
it's about shortening the trip as much as possible by choosing which apples to go by, that said horde can only get 30-32 tokens max</div></div><hr />

<br />
-15 tokens from the barking quest<br />
-10 from defending against the dwarves<br />
-30+ from ram racing<br />
<br />
That's 55+ tokens per day, plus all the one time turn-ins. <br />
<br />
<br />
Hello alliance, enjoy those free tokens!<br />
<br />
Its reasonably 20 tokens/day for horde from the ram racing, that is once you get some practice and come up with a proper route. Yes, 24 is possible but its a pain and trying to agressively min-max just increases the odds you miss the apple tub &quot;pulse&quot; a couple times and end up with far less. I have 3 characters with the 2007 slow speed rams (600 tokens, less quests) and now 6 brewmasters, so I say that with some experience ;)<br />
<br />
However yes, including the one-shot quests and just making sure to do the dailies you would easily have 350+ tokens in the first week. I finished my DK last thursday if I remember right, every other character had some at least 1 piece of leftover clothing and whatnot.<br />
<br />
<br />
BTW, a 18/20hr timer is worse than a 24hr daily reset if you have a variable schedule or actually get out on the weekends. I wish they would realize that for stuff like this brewfest and transmutes...quit rewarding freeloading people who can sleep whenever and log in 24/7 with &quot;bonuses&quot; on cooldowns and the like.<br />
The daily timer works quite well, I have no problems getting quests I want done even if I end up doing 2nd or overnight shifts covering for someone, but I've ended up having my transmute timers shoved a whole day forward many many times.</div></div><hr />

Lightbringer had a restart though, it was on the login page.<br />
<br />
US-Bleeding Hollow: no Abyssal Shatter yet (at least not on the Dalaran trainer, I didn't bother to check anywhere else).</div></div><hr />

Those people must be a pure DPS classes that don't need to have bank/bag space for gear.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You got your bank space back when they let you learn pets/mounts. You can start vendoring those drops from MC, really you can...1 set of &quot;vanity gear&quot; is plenty.<br />
<br />
My paladin with 3 specs of up to date gear has no problems, and has room for a 4th if I ever did arena on it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just to let people know before the QQ starts up. I play on a CST server, where I was counting on Brewfest ending at 11:59pm. At 10:45 I then remembered that the instance servers are on Eastern Time so I had to get a quick group together for the direbrew boss. at 11:59 on the clock while in the instance, the mobs related to brewfest despawned, but Brewfest was still happening on the server.<br />
<br />
So apparently even though the event is still going on, the boss is no more. :( (at least on my server)</div></div><hr />
