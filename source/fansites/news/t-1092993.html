I already said that I don't expect the alpha/beta to be out before the NDA lift on the press tour on March 19th, but I wouldn't be surprised to see it soon afterward. Stay tuned, things are starting to look great! <br />

Cataclysm Post Mortem -- Greg “Ghostcrawler” Street<br />
As part of our World of Warcraft: Cataclysm post mortem series, we sat down with World of Warcraft Lead Systems Designer Greg “Ghostcrawler” Street to talk about his thoughts on World of Warcraft: Cataclysm.<br />
<br />
Q. What were your main goals going into Cataclysm?<br />
<br />
A: Westfall was a seven-year-old zone with seven-year-old trees and seven-year-old quests. It naturally felt old. It felt tired for players going back to level up an alt, and it wasn’t inspiring for new players coming to the game. We just felt like it was time to give all of those old 1-60 zones some attention again. Beyond that though, we wanted to update the classes at low level as well. The spell flow, by which we mean the level you get certain spells, just hadn’t aged well. You would get some very group-focused buffs at low level and some powerful leveling tools at high level, which would have made more sense reversed. There were some specs that just weren’t functional at low level before because they lacked the damage abilities or tools to effectively solo. Similarly, we took a look at all of the quest rewards at 1-60 because some specs just didn’t have adequate itemization to support them.<br />
<br />
A second goal, from the systems design point of view, was to improve the class talent trees. We thought the trees had become bloated with filler instead of legitimately interesting talents. We also embraced the notion of class specialization to a much greater degree, by letting you choose your spec formally at level 10.<br />
<br />
We also knew we needed to provide more content to players focused on maximum level, which meant we couldn’t just re-do 1-60, but we had to provide questing zones, class mechanics, and new PvP and PvE content for players who would be at level 85 too.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2012/march/gcpm1_small.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2012/march/gcpm1.jpg)<br />
<br />
Finally, we wanted to deliver all of this content more aggressively. We know players can only wait so long for something new to do before they start to get bored. This has been a goal for some time, but it has been a challenging one for us. When you compare the graphic fidelity of a raid like Firelands to an older raid like Molten Core, you can imagine how it takes both more time and more people to make a raid these days. That’s exactly the opposite of what we want to be doing though, which is providing players content at faster rates.<br />
<br />
Q. What do you think worked best in Cataclysm?<br />
<br />
A. We’re really happy with the 1-60 revamp. Each zone looks amazing, we improved their quest flow, and they all have a story that has a (hopefully) meaningful climax, often with a blue item reward. Zones that didn’t have much going on before have an actual plot now, many of which are related to Deathwing’s return. We also did a better job of integrating the dungeons in a zone into the questing experience for that zone, so you feel like you have a good reason to explore them.<br />
<br />
We really like how having players choose a spec at level 10 worked out. I’d say nearly every single design decision we make ends up being at least somewhat controversial in that some players agree with them and some players disagree with them -- that’s just the reality of having such a large and diverse player base. But choosing a spec at level 10 was as close to universally acclaimed by players as anything we’ve ever done. It just works. You get a meaningful choice early on, and powerful, useful, and fun abilities to go along with it. It leads to each spec having a stronger sense of identity, even at higher level.<br />
<br />
We’re pretty happy with the level 80-85 content that we offered. The zones looked great and the stories were good. We offered several new dungeons, raids, and Battlegrounds. Late in the cycle of Cataclysm, we introduced Raid Finder, which provided a new type of content to players who historically weren’t raiders. We’re at the part of the lifespan of the game where some original features no longer have the cachet they used to -- you can only roll up so many alts, and by this point you might very well be done with achievements or convinced yourself that that type of gameplay isn’t for you. When we can offer a whole new way to play the game -- in this case provide raids to non-raiders -- it’s a big win.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2012/march/gcpm2_small.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2012/march/gcpm2.jpg)<br />
<br />
Transmogrification is another one of those features -- it opened up an entirely new avenue of gameplay. One of the great things it’s done, aside from giving players more tools to personalize their characters of course, is make a lot of old content relevant again. Now players are doing old raids and dungeons looking for Transmogrification pieces, and that’s really cool.<br />
<br />
I could name a few smaller features we thought worked out as well. The Justice / Honor badge system in Cataclysm cleaned up the crazy system from Lich King. All things considered, we’re happy with the healing model. We encountered issues with mana being in short supply at lower gear levels and conversely too abundant at the higher levels, eliminating much of the challenge for healers when the content is supposed to be the most difficult, but overall the model did what we wanted, and we’ll be refining it in Mists.<br />
<br />
Q. What didn’t work out as planned?<br />
<br />
Everything else! Seriously though, we tend to be our own harshest critics, so it’s actually easy for us to point out things that didn’t work out as expected.<br />
<br />
While zones like Uldum and Deepholm look fantastic, they didn’t fit together as well as we’d have liked. In the planning phases, we didn’t think that having scattered end game zones would be a big deal. It turned out to feel a lot weirder than expected. Players ended up teleporting to nearly every destination, and it gave Cataclysm a disjointed feeling, detracting from that feeling of exploration and discovery. We learned that giving players a land to explore, a sense of place, is valuable. Ultimately, the scattered zones and the portals both served to kind of shrink the world, when we want to make the world a place you want to go out and be in. We’re definitely looking forward to getting back to a continent in Mists. We underestimated how important that was.<br />
<br />
In addition, while we liked that each zone has a story, questing ended up being too linear. It didn’t feel like you could fly into a zone, find some quest givers, and explore. Instead, you kind of had to start at the beginning and follow all the quests to the end, and if you didn’t like a quest, well, you had to stick with it to get to the next one. We want zones to have an identity, flavor and a story, but we don’t want to railroad players through a zone either.<br />
<br />
The difficulty at which we pegged our heroic dungeons and raids was controversial. They were designed to be about as tough as the dungeons were back in Burning Crusade, but the game has changed since then. Coming out of Lich King, we’d gotten the message loud and clear from players that they wanted tougher challenges. They liked the convenience of Dungeon Finder, but they missed using their crowd control and survival abilities and having to strategize about how to beat a given encounter. We designed the Cataclysm heroics with that in mind, and the players who wanted challenging content were thrilled.<br />
<br />
The problem was that we had this whole group of players who felt like they couldn’t make any progress on their characters. Even if they wanted to end up raiding with their friends, they couldn’t earn the gear they needed to get into those raids (especially in the absence of Raid Finder). I don’t believe that the instances were too hard; it’s obvious there are players who enjoy that content. I believe the problem was that there were no alternatives. With such a diverse community, the goal is to have experiences that players from all over the spectrum can enjoy. We don’t want to shut anyone out. So, we’re addressing that with Challenge Modes in Mists. You’ll have normal and heroic mode dungeons, and then Challenge Modes, for players who are looking to prove their mettle. Likewise, you’ll have normal and heroic raids, and Raid Finder for players who don’t enjoy wiping on a boss week after week until they can master it.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
While choosing a spec at level 10 felt great, we weren’t very happy with the rest of the talent tree overhaul. We definitely pruned some dead wood from the trees and got rid of some talents that weren’t a lot of fun, but players felt like they weren’t getting anything out of the bargain. Having simpler trees is a good goal, but it would have felt better if players felt like they got something cool in return for losing some boring fluff. Unfortunately, as is the case with many compromises, this one didn’t fully solve the original problems it was intended to solve, while it created new ones.<br />
<br />
Fundamentally, taking into account what we’ve learned about talent trees over the years, we’ve come to the conclusion that the talent tree model where you pick up tiny performance increases here and there (and where there’s, mathematically, nearly always a ‘right’ answer and a ‘wrong’ answer) is not a great model. The Mists talent design is a major revamp that should fix this problem once and for all. Talents should be meaningful game-changers. At absolute worst a given talent may be the right one only situationally, and at best, players will have a lot more customization to make their play-style stand out. Furthermore, the fact that you’ll have more flexibility to change your talents should help keep gameplay fresh, even with that character that you play most often.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
I feel like I should mention Abyssal Maw again. As with many cancelled features, it somehow took on a life of its own in the minds of players. Believe me, though -- you just don’t cancel things that you think are going to be awesome. It was three bosses inside Nespirah, with no unique art. The reason it was originally appealing to us was because we had so many Vashj’ir assets that we could use. But by the time it was time to do the work, we felt like we (and many players) had Vashj’ir fatigue. Now don’t get me wrong -- I loved Vashj’ir. I was an oceanographer, remember? Vashj’ir delivered on the promise of an underwater zone, but we feel like most players were ready to be done with it by the time they had quested through that. (Individuals will feel differently -- it’s that diverse player base thing again.) Firelands received a lot of new art, from bosses to environments, and we just didn’t feel like Abyssal Maw was going to compete. Who knows, though! We haven’t totally given up on the idea of cool underwater experiences, so maybe there’s potential we’d visit it again someday. (For my money, the zone I am personally saddest about cancelling is not Abyssal Maw; it was the Azjol-Nerub quest zone in Wrath of the Lich King.)<br />
<br />
Speaking of raids, we also weren’t particularly happy with how accessible legendary items became in Cataclysm. Multiple characters in a single raiding guild were getting, and worse, expecting a legendary weapon. Legendaries are supposed to be rare and exciting, not a bar you fill up like some reputation grind, and certainly not something you feel entitled to get because it’s “your turn.” Dragonwrath in particular was usable by a large variety of class specs, which coupled with the guarantee to completion, just made them too ubiquitous. In the future, legendaries will be more legendary, perhaps so much so that not every raiding guild will have one. In that model, there might be those who almost, but not quite, complete one, but there will also be those who finish one and feel truly honored.<br />
<br />
I have mixed feelings about Archaeology. I feel like it’s a good addition to professions and offers more, and more varied, gameplay than our existing professions. Still, it’s clear that some players wanted more. We wanted Archaeology to be hard to complete. We didn’t want it to be one of those professions you can max out by buying up mats at the Auction House. But random reward systems whose long-term goals are more interesting than the short term ones can feel grindy. Archaeology had too much travel time. It could be punishingly random, especially for players who imagined that it would be a guaranteed delivery mechanism for Zin’rokh (which was never the intention). Players missed a lot of the lore, which was delivered in the Archaeology journal and not as part of the survey or digging experience. We think the Mists of Pandaria expansion will be really good for Archaeology. Players will be focused on a couple of new races on a single continent, so travel and randomness will be reduced automatically, and leveling Archaeology should be a bit more convenient since there will be more opportunities to dig at a single site. We have other tricks up our sleeve too.<br />
<br />

<br />
Q. What lessons have you learned and what are some of your top goals for Mists of Pandaria?<br />
<br />
There are four big goals for Mists:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Get players out into the world. We don’t want to totally eliminate convenience, so it’s fine to queue for some features from capital cities, but we also want players to see other players out in the world, questing, trying world bosses, engaging in PvP, and just travelling from place to place.<br />
<br />
Give players plenty to do. It’s a sad feeling, and a real failure on our part, whenever someone says “I want to play WoW this evening, but I just don’t have anything to do.” Like I said above, achievements and alts were great in their time, and we’ll continue to support them, but we understand the need for new ways to play as well. The new expansion will have entirely new systems, like scenarios and challenge modes. We are designing the initial zones to have features similar to the Molten Front daily area, so you don’t feel like questing is something you finish at level 90 (and so you don’t feel like daily quests are synonymous with ‘boring’ or ‘grind’). We want to make the Pandaria factions interesting. We want Exalted to be something you earn for bragging rights, not something every player has. We are adding a lot of mounts that will be hard to get, and awesome-looking armor that you’ll want just for transmogrification. We’re considering ways to let you increase the number of Conquest points you can earn per week or a way to translate questing into bonus loot from instances. We want to hide lots of cool little things all over Pandaria. Some will offer your character more power and some won’t. And if you really like achievements and alts, well hopefully we’ve got you covered there too, with account-level achievements and a new race and class.<br />
<br />
Appeal to a broad audience. I’m always surprised by the number of players who want the game to be easier and the equal number who want the game to be harder (and can’t understand why anyone would disagree with them!) We approach the issue in a different way -- we think that what all of those players are really saying is that they want content for them. Message received. We’ll be offering Raid Finder versions of all of our raids going forward. We’ll be offering brutally difficult challenge modes of dungeons for players who thought the Cataclysm heroics were too easy. We’re experimenting with some tricky boss encounters for players who loved the hard-mode Ulduar achievements. We want to provide more cross-over between PvE and PvP, for those who are interested, so that it doesn’t feel like you have to play two different games to progress your character. We want to continually add new Battlegrounds, so those players have fresh experiences to look forward to. We’ll provide players with ways to upgrade their gear incrementally, while reserving tier sets for actual boss kills.<br />
<br />
Get great content out faster. Enough said.<br />
<br />

good answers thought and insightful, he missed alot out by talking about the 1-60 stuff that was covered in the last post mortem.<br />
<br />
After the disappointment of the raid/dungeon post mortem, I think GC was more realistic in terms of the failures. Quite honestly, it would have been bad if he'd called out members of his development team in a public forum like this. That stuff is best kept internal and professional. It also suggests to me that they are not planning on changing the current raid model of smaller raids, but trying to add content elsewhere. As a raider, I find this disappointing, but I certainly understand how they would like to divide their resources among every demographic who plays the game. In the big picture it seems like they are going to try to please everyone, unfortunately I think that is impossible.</div></div><hr />

Now where did I hear that before? Right. It was GC at the start of wotlk... at cata beta... The trainers and all that are located in og an sw, why would anyone want to be someplace else? Right, because other towns have nothing better to offer. My realm doesnt even have enough players on horde side to fill a noobzone. Which is one of the biggest fails of cata. Players running away or the general inbalance of realms. And he is missing something. Players have a very different point of view than he or the devs have. I see the same bugs that I reported in the first month of cata. Blinking char button for example. Its not a big issue but its something that I encounter everytime I log in. They could fix hundrets of bugs each patch but instead they have like 10 or 20 things fixed that dont even affect the majority of players. Sinestra got fixed at the first attempts FOR 50 PLAYERS by a GM sitting next to them. Yesterday I encountered a bug while catching up old quests with my main for the archievement and the GM already knew what was wrong. He was prepared for a bug thats been there for over a year. There is no hope of ever fixing it. A GM ticket is the faster way. Thats no solution. And thats whats killing this game. Blizzards ignorance towards the things that need fixing. GC is fixing things that are not broken. But hey, I dont have to understand blizzards logic. Wow is still a great game even if blizzard is killing the fun more and more (for me).</div></div><hr />

This. It is not GC's job to get into the details of encounters and how good or bad raids were. That should have been addressed in the joke that was the Dungeons and Raids post mortem, but wasn't. This post mortem was just an overall one, talking about things in broad strokes.</div></div><hr />

I just hope that since Blizzard understand their problems they will fix them in MoP. Especially the linear questlines in the new zones. For me, the most entertaining part of Cataclysm was at its very beginning. I decided to try healing and found it so much fun with the dungeons difficulty and mana management. The heroics were really challenging, and I had a lot of fun playing the game. Healing in FL or DS is not that interesting now when mana is not an issue any more, and I look forward to the result of their &quot;tuning&quot; in MoP. The talent trees revamp in Mists is really interesting, and I think that speccing will finally become really individual and will have more of that &quot;playing style&quot; than it is now. As for Abyssal Maw, I really don't care much for Vashj'ir and the whole underwater thing. It is just my personal taste. On the whole this is a vary interesting reading. Now I have some hope that they won't screw the game in MoP.</div></div><hr />

We’re at the part of the lifespan of the game where some original features no longer have the cachet they used to -- you can only roll up so many alts, and by this point you might very well be done with achievements or convinced yourself that that type of gameplay isn’t for you.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lore Lord</div><div class="date">2012-03-07, 06:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This interview acutually got me thinking that MoP might not be that bad and might get me to start playing again. The previous Cataclysm Post-Mortem left a really bad taste in my mouth and made me think they hadn't learned anything, especially the part about 5-mans being something that should be doable in a 10 minute lunch break. Ghostcrawler, on the other hand, pretty much singled out all of the main probelms I had with Cataclysm, mainly linearized questing, easy reputations that everyone gets to exalted just for playing for 2 weeks, and lack of cosmetic rewards people get just to show off. He also recognized that a lot of people, myself included, really liked the Cata heroics at launch and were significantly disappointed when they were nerfed. However, I'm not sure challenge modes really fix the problem. From my understanding, challenge modes aren't a third difficulty, but thing liked timed runs which are really just achievements that aren't in the achievements tab. I want the challenge to be getting the bosses down, not seeing how fast I can roflstomp the entire instance like I was in WotLK. Another concern I have is that Ghostcrawler is just one developer. Ghostcrawler was the one who, despite player complaints, said that heroics were fine where they were and weren't going to be nerfed pretty much less than a week before the nerf patch was announced. Ghostcrawler's views of where they went wrong might not line up with the vies of the majority of the developers, and I am worried that other developers might see things like more difficult reputations as a bad idea.<br />
<br />
The other worrying thing is many of his points, particularly more to do in the world, are announced for every expansion and never happen. So, while I am excited to read that Blizzard knows where they went wrong, I am overall not very optimistic that they will actually be able to fix it, especially since any change will trigger half the player base to demand the old way back.</div></div><hr />

Since Blizzard alread said that the way it is since FL nerfs will be the way for MoP, read the last part as &quot;until we nerf it one month later&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Get great content out faster. Enough said.&quot;<br />
<br />
Guess we'll see the patch 5.1 with the old favorite revamped ICC converted into a 5man heroic joke in the end... great content... faster... right...<br />
<br />
&quot;It was three bosses inside Nespirah, with no unique art. The reason it was originally appealing to us was because we had so many Vashj’ir assets that we could use.&quot;<br />
<br />
After dealing with upgraded BWL (BWD), Molten Core (FL) and all the re-used stuff from Dragon Soul... he throws that to us and he wants us to accept it... If they find the Vashj'ir assets not unique, there is nothing telling them that they couldn't create new ones. Ah yes... probably the &quot;small development team with poor resources...&quot; excuse.<br />
<br />
And better remove the legendary from the game alread. It's not working anymore. Right now it became a free season faceroll for the class that receives it. Ppl don't want to put the time on it anymore so it could become legendary as they want. It needs to be easy to get and fast or it's not worth. And all the other players from other classes will just complain that they're on the receiving end against legendary players on pvp. Each tier now needs to have one, there is a list of classes, in order, that should get the next ones, discussions all over the place, etc. Just remove it from the game from now on. Shadowmourne was the last one with the &quot;legendary&quot; feel on it since you had to deal with new stuff from 3 of the most dificult bosses from the place (or wait the nerfs) while also killing them (and could fail at 1% of the boss dying from the debuffs while the raid kills it), unlike Dragonwrath and totally, by a lot, unlike the rogue daggers that you just pickpocket a boss and then grind itens, while alread getting the a good part of the final effect on the 1st version. Anyone remember rolling around a simple Shadow's Edge that was worse than 1st boss drop? Yeah...<br />
<br />
In the end, more of the same... he talks about a game that is not the Cataclysm we played and won't be what we'll get for MoP.</div></div><hr />

This port-mortem note by ghostcrawler is really refreshing after the terrible taste that was left in my mouth from the raid encounter post-mortem post. As someone who appreciates pvp/pve I am really excited for mists. Good things in that post. That's because GC speaks the truth, the raid post-mortem was a big wall of bullshit, if I remember right Daelo even praised how &quot;good&quot; ZG/ZA revamps were and shit like that. Well obviously players felt awkward when he praised some re-used bullshit.</div></div><hr />

(really asking :/)'lead quest designer' is a title that is pretty self-explanatory, but 'lead systems designer' sounds like it could be a whole lot.He talks about a lot of different aspects of the game, so what does/doesn't he overlook? (Asking because there is no mention of PvP at all yet. Is PvP not his thing?)<br />
EDIT: Really enjoyed the post and agree on most points. I just hope they actually deliver and gain some people's faiths again. (I personally am pretty happy w/ wow atm, though something better is always good :D)<br />
<br />
My understanding is that he oversees the design of the underlying systems in the game. Things like how combat flows, how the economy flows, etc. He doesn't deal in the specific content (IE, the design of a raid or the auction house) but he designs the underlying systems that those things use. He and his team are the ones that come up with the algorithms to convert Crit Rating to Crit chance, ensure that there are no means of duplicating items or gold, control the physics and how your characters move, etc. Their work is more behind the scenes but is the building blocks for everything you see.</div></div><hr />

The part about alts not cutting it anymore strikes particularly true. I leveled all the alts I wanted to during the 1 year gap with no content at the end of WotLK after 3.3. I imagine that's why WoW kept me engaged in that period while Cataclysm has seen me playing quite a bit less, because there simply isn't as much to do once you have the high levels you want. They're really gonna need to start looking into alternate ways of keeping players occupied because many of their older players will have had their fill of some of the most time-consuming aspects at this point.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pejo</div><div class="date">2012-03-07, 07:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;We’re considering ways to let you increase the number of Conquest points you can earn per week or a way to translate questing into bonus loot from instances.&quot;I hope they DON'T do this, or find another way to do it. *Linking any activities to be helpful for raid will only make those activities become mandatory for raiders instead of optional. *Things like the new pokemon system, the challenge mode that only rewards transmorg gears, etc, are great: we can do them if we want, but we aren't potentially gimmping ourselves for raid if we're not. *But if the activities helps out for raid, such as farming for flasks/potions vanilla-style, then they become mandatory for serious raiders and it will just be extra burden.<br />
These extra benefits that &quot;raise&quot; your cap will most likely be things like the Weekly raid quest that we had in WOTLK to get people going back to older raids. This is also how I expect them to push world pvp by having a weekly quest where you must take over the opposite faction's city.<br />
<br />
Can someone clarify this for me? The item squish, is there anything new about that, whether it will happen or not. Or has nothing been said about it?<br />
Nothing has been said on this as of yet, expect an update in mid March. <br />
Nothing about dead empty realms, nothing about 25 and 10 man raiding. All answers are really like the one once given for the Cata launch, more yadda yadda, faster yadda yadda. If you translate it to common language it's saying: Please keep paying, all will be better with the next expansion, sorry but i don't believe a single word, these same promises were given at the start of cata, and we all have seen what it was. They have already stated they are happy that 10/25 are moving towards being equal in terms of difficulty (not perfect but its a lot better). They have also commented that they are working on how to fix dead servers -- it is a lot harder to fix than you think. A lot of people don't want to give up their server even if it's dead, they don't want to lose their name/guild/etc. They just released SOR yesterday that will allow people to transfer to a friend's server if that is a reason why you quit.<br />
<br />
Main point is there is no quick fix. If you have an idea on how to fix it, feel free to post it on the WoW forum.<br />
<br />
Edit: <br />
Promises Please read the article again, GOALS. This is the same shit every expansion, they have goals yet people cry they were promised. One thing is mentioned at Blizzcon and now it becomes a promise. They very rarely promise just in case they can't deliver.</div></div><hr />

I'm really glad they admitted that the game is boring and are working on new things to do. This is why I went to Rift (who wants to farm Dragon Soul for 5 more months?) After reading that and playing Rift for 2 months, I feel like their goals for MoP are to make the game more Rift-like (not a fanboy, that's just my opinion). Get content out faster, make new kinds of content rather than a new BG/raid every few months.. These are things Rift (and other new MMOs to an extent) have done and why they are stealing subscribers. I hope they really are trying to bring their game back to the way it used to be. I'll buy MoP and hopefully it will have progressed as a game and not just added on.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'd say around 2, maybe 3, legendaries per guild (based on whether in 10 or 25) made during the 6 months from that content release to the next raid content. We don't need to bring back RNGendaries like the vanilla/BC ones. That just makes things too rare and only rewards the super lucky.</div></div><hr />

I agree, and not in a rude way, we all want the next mmo to do what WoW did for us, and we equate that with being similar. The problem is then you just get a clone that cant possibly match 7 years of content at launch and people hate it because it doesnt have any identity of its own, its just a cheap immitation even tho thats what we tell them we want. The cycle keeps repeating itself.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kostor</div><div class="date">2012-03-07, 07:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The biggest design mistake in my opinion is neglecting Vashj'ir so much. It's the biggest zone in WoW (actually the only zone that is divided into subzones) with some of the most stunning environments, yet it only yields about 3 hours of gameplay. Once you have the quest achievement there is basically zero reason to go back to Vashj'ir (except maybe camping for the Poseidus Mount). Every other of the new Cata zones has at least one additional purpose than just leveling up:<br />
<br />
Hyjal - Firelands dailies<br />
Deepholm - Therazane dailies<br />
Uldum - archaeology farming (Tol'vir)<br />
Twilight Highlands - Wildhammer / Dragonmaw dailies<br />
<br />
Ghostcrawler explains why they canceled the Abyssal Maw. But I think it should have been made into a 5-player dungeon like originnaly announced at Blizzcon and could have been a nice addition to patch 4.2. I personally would have liked to have a daily questing area in Vashj'ir as well.<br />
<br />
<br />
Second big mistake in my opinion was the setting of the Dragonsoul raid. Dragonblight is a Wotlk zone and just feels wrong for Deathwing. They should have made the raid similar to Grim Batol (they could have recycled all the Grim Batol assets for the Deathwing raid just as easily as Dragonblight) and set the dungeon entrance to Twilight Highlands.<br />
<br />
Third big mistake was the &quot;abandoning&quot; of Tol Barad. I don't mean the PvP bosses or the honor farming with that but the fact that the rewards for the Tol Barad tokens were never updated. This lead to players doing the Tol Barad dailies only at the beginning of the expansion. Once you had all the rewards (which doesn't take too long, maybe a month) there was zero reason to do the dailies. The ganking which was always pretty fun died out as less and less people were doing the dailies. Tol Barad peninsula was the only thing in Cata remotely close to an open PvP area yet there wasn't enough incentive to go there regularly. This is even more sad as Wintergrasp rewards got updated with almost every content patch.<br />
Why not provide something like the new PvP epic gems which are on conquest point vendors since 4.3 for Tol Barad tokens?</div></div><hr />

In that model, there might be those who almost, but not quite, complete one, but there will also be those who finish one and feel truly honored. Good news and bad news. Good that there will be fewer Legendaries. Bad that I get the feeling 10 and 25 still wont be balanced and will become even worse.</div></div><hr />

We don’t want to shut anyone out. Then why did you shut people out? Not just people but you shut out the majority of people with Cataclysm, the question is: why? There has to have been some sort of developer meeting during WotLK when they were planning Cataclysm, someone must have uttered the sentence &quot;BC was great, lets make BC 2.0 guys!&quot;? Who is responsible for making such a quite frankly..idiotic decision? People bought Cataclysm in millions as evident by numbers but immediatly quit because heroics took too long to do and the queue times were abysmal for anyone but tanks. But then again doing the heroics was a horrid experience for them because you changed so much. Why? I ask again, they mention themselves that they hated the idea that there were massive amounts of players who wanted to play WoW but didnt, because they had nothing to do. They were locked out of content, and in the other extreme case the raiders were bored as they had run through everything. WotLK is the closest they have gotten to &quot;not want to shut anyone out&quot; and even that expansion could have been improved on. Why get away from WotLK to chase to chase some nostalgia trip dream that wasent that great to begin with? BC will always be special because it was the first expansion, but emulating it today in 2012 is not possible.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But when have they ever admitted the problems they're admitting right now? It's nice to see for once. As for sitting in a captial, well it's all about stretching content. Like it or not, eventually everyone will be, but if they can stop that by adding a bunch of things like fishing for mounts that helps right? Again, that's just one example. We never got that in Cata, with the exception of the new DMF pet, but that doesn't really count. You mention world PvP as an example, but the reality is most people don't care about that anymore. WoW is a PvE game first and PvP second. You can spin it anyway you like, but that's been the reality since day 1 and it will always be. If you want further proof, the majority of guilds on a server are PvE. There aren't exactly a ton of servers where PvP guilds outnumber PvE guilds. Look, I'm not saying it's a bad idea, but even if they added it, it won't make much of a difference. That gets boring and boring fast.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This could easily have been phoned in &quot;I AM HAPPY THAT YOU GUYS LOVE THE EXPANSION, BLAME THE ECONOMY OR XBOX KINECT WHY WE LOST 2 MILLION SUBS LOL; WOW IS AWESOME BUY MOP LOLZ&quot;, instead he actually wrote a pretty long post about what went wrong. <br />
<br />
He is dead right about questing getting worse, the railroad thing to me has ruined WoW solo experience<br />
<br />
But wait a second, didnt this man give a few blog posts at the start of Cata, telling &quot;baddies&quot; to shut it and get better? How Cata was going to fix all the supposed problems that WotLK had? <br />
<br />
And now he is basically done a 180 with &quot;With such a diverse community, the goal is to have experiences that players from all over the spectrum can enjoy. We don’t want to shut anyone out.&quot;. <br />
<br />
Yet that is what Cata was designed for, to shut people out, to punish them, to bring back &quot;Raid or Die&quot; mentality, to make epics feel special again by not giving them out to anyone but the absolute most devoted of players. Somehow they thought this would make casual players stick around, when it was the PvP gear in BC that got them hooked on and the &quot;welfare&quot; epics of WotLK that made those 2 expansions expand the audience.<br />
<br />
Cataclysm is the only expansion pack from Blizzard that has felt like it degressed the game it was made for, every other expansion felt like it was made to make progress. Yet for some reason they felt that they needed to go back, years down the line.</div></div><hr />

Aside from the fact that you shouldn't have the same gear as more hardcore players with less time devoted to the game: it's a PR move. Lots of companies do this, and Blizzard did it with Wrath too (heroics were too easy, everything turned into an AoE clusterfuck, the dungeons and zones will look cooler, etc.) This way they can make the playerbase think things will be improved because they know what went wrong, but the obvious part is that they ALWAYS knew what went wrong and what would go wrong and chose to go forward with those choices anyways.</div></div><hr />

Like he said, it wasn't the difficulty per se that caused hard heroics to fail, it was the lack of available alternatives. While so many people are leaping for joy at the WotLK-style heroics, it's at least comforting to know that GC sees eye-to-eye with the hardcore crowd.<br />
<br />
On the note of Abyssal Maw, that issue can finally rest in peace in my mind. The Abyssal Maw is a vast sea with enormous potential as a dungeon or raid. Their design consisted of three unoriginal bosses inside of a turtle's shell. After that admission, how the flying fuck can anyone still be upset about that crap getting the chop?<br />
<br />
Also really glad to see how much spice they are planning on adding in Pandaria. &quot;Exalted [is] something you earn for bragging rights?&quot; Be still my heart.<br />

Challenge modes won't be a roflstomp as much as you think because your gear would be normalized, so getting a better time would actually involve more skill + practice.</div></div><hr />

Again thats like me wanting horseradish on my Big Mac. I may want that but again masses are going to rule the day. I also didnt like the lower leveling part of Cata. I understand you do not want to spend 3 plus months leveling thru 3 dead expansions but I hated what they did to lower level dungeons. They nerfed them far too much. My thoughts.</div></div><hr />

I really disagree, their mistake was not making enough 85 normal modes. If they had created a few more of the normal 85's, and toned down the heroics 5's just a tad (that luck of the draw fix would have been enough.) I mean really the heroics were being cleared at the beginning of the expansion on LFD, I know i did tones of them the first few months.<br />
<br />
and as a healer coming for wrath the mana efficiency &quot;nerf&quot; was the most fun I have had in this game. It was challenging, but doable and you could really feel like you were saving your group. I played a holy priest and they were horrible with their mana but with 10 mins of studying you could heal all the heroics. <br />
<br />
Now heroics are just.. blah to heal and healing is very very easy right now, hell I healed normal DS with my za/zg geared holy pally ( granted they are op)</div></div><hr />

IIRC, you couldn't get your full cap from just dungeons, you had to do some raiding, or vice versa. So, as a raider, I was forced to do heroics which were mind-numbingly easy while carrying bad pugs I didn't care for. Now that a full clear of a raid gives me the max VP I can possibly expect, I don't need to do ANY heroics, and, as far as I'm concerned, they can make heroics as easy as they want, since I'll only ever go in them in the initial weeks of MoP to gear up for the initial raids, or to farm JP for any reason I'd need to farm JP for.</div></div><hr />

Not everyone can/wants to raid, and, among those, there are a lot of people who are good at the game obv.<br />
5 man Heroics are supposed to cater to those players.(Challenging content for casuals)<br />
<br />
Normal 5 men are for everyone else, sadly, cataclysm didn't offer a good collection of those (just 3 at max level).<br />

I think that heroics at the start of Cataclysm were perfectly where they should have been. Rather than nerfing heroics and tacking on &quot;challenge mode&quot; I feel like something should have been added in the middle for the crybaby chumps who couldn't be bothered to learn to CC, focus fire and interrupt (which, let's be honest, was all it took to complete even the toughest heroic). It feels as if I'm being penalized or punished for being a skilled player who enjoys finding a challenge that kicks my ass the first couple of times I do it. The concept of &quot;challenge mode&quot; just feels icky. I don't think speed-runs should be the focus of the more difficult dungeons. I like actual difficulty increases, not a timer.

Lots of companies do this, and Blizzard did it with Wrath too (heroics were too easy, everything turned into an AoE clusterfuck, the dungeons and zones will look cooler, etc.) This way they can make the playerbase think things will be improved because they know what went wrong, but the obvious part is that they ALWAYS knew what went wrong and what would go wrong and chose to go forward with those choices anyways.<br />

Max-Level normal 5-mans should be slightly challenging at max level with a mix of green/blue quest gear, and should award decent blue level gear. You also get some mileage if there is a set w/ bonuses to collect.Heroics should step that up and be tough when you have full blue gear from normals, and REALLY hard/close to impossible without CC and a good comp if you go in w/ quest gear.As an expansion progresses, they should extend the tier releases to include 5 mans at a higher difficulty. Also, and this would help tremendously with the feel of running dungeons (especially randoms), any non-signature loot should be randomized across all the bosses of a tier. It would be a TON better having a huge loot table available for every boss you do.</div></div><hr />

In addition, while we liked that each zone has a story, questing ended up being too linear. It didn’t feel like you could fly into a zone, find some quest givers, and explore. Instead, you kind of had to start at the beginning and follow all the quests to the end, and if you didn’t like a quest, well, you had to stick with it to get to the next one. We want zones to have an identity, flavor and a story, but we don’t want to railroad players through a zone either. For a person like me with a lot of alts this by far the worst part. After the first max toon I know which quests I hated. It would be nice to be able to skip them and still be able to get to the end of the zone.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Open slots in PUG raids are extremely fleeting and short-lived. That's why people are sitting in the city watching Trade like a hawk. And guess what? They can watch Trade channel while they are still queued for dungeons or battlegrounds so what's the point of blocking people from the official raid finding tool?<br />
<br />
They need to accept that some people are going to bail in dungeons or battlegrounds. Shield didn't drop off first boss? Bail. Other side capped a flag first in WSG? Bail. So having it lockout the Raid Browser while you are doing dungeons or battlegrounds is stupid<br />
<br />
.Better yet, let us queue OFFLINE toons. Let me login on my healer, queue up, then log back to my tank main. If people searching Raid Browser need a healer, they whisper and it comes to me. That would really get people out of trade, where the only way to identify what you can do is watch for ads and then whisper people back.</div></div><hr />

I think you missed the spirit of his comment. All MMOs are improvements of the granddaddy EQ, so saying anyone building upon an existing platform is ripping off other titles is wrong. Even Bashiok said once that Blizzard doesn't innovate, they apply other good ideas and try to make the best possible game. Without EQ and Galaxies, WoW would probably not be here. The more pressure on Blizzard the better because they need to earn my money, not expect it.<br />
<br />
Rift has added some remarkable mechanics and features that you're going to probably see in WoW in MoP. The champion titles will make better games for everyone. Besides, Rift is not like WoW anymore, especially in the raiding department. It's extremely unforgiving to every single player and difficulty levels are the content itself without catchup gear. I'd say it's more like Classic if anything and that's the attraction. It is definitely not like WoW because their patches tend to change and add to the gameplay a little more radically and they don't futz around with the classes and nerf crap like GC/WoW do in every patch.<br />
<br />
What's funny to me is that this MoP Beta is going to have about a million people in it. They may as well call it an early release. I have zero interest in either beta or actual release so I'll just wish everyone good times.</div></div><hr />

i'm sorry i didn't mean to hurt your feelings. *rift is in the same boat as wow in terms of lvling, talent trees, tank, healer, dps and progression raiding. *but that's where it ends. *rift has lots more at end game and oh look now blizzard is going to add a lot of those features as well. *<br />

The new dungeon difficulty will be the next thing that points out the Balancing issues in the game. Thats NOT what the game needs. It needs to have content that is balanced enough so every class can get through it while progressing. We do NOT need extra tuned dungeons that suit one class or one spec more than others. THere will be perfect combinations of classes for this and that is just a nightmare to think about. Something that BLizzard should feel ashamed of doing. It is not needed its pointless and will draw yet again point out the weakenesses of balance when it is not really needed.<br />

Get great content out faster... So now its not more faster... now its just great. So we could wait for 12 more months with nothing in WOW. No wonder they are going full out to drag in some subs now. MOP sounds at least 8 months away. Its a total and utter disaster for Blizzard to have taken their eyes off WOW in the last 2 years and they should not be forgiven for that. PPL want more content and more PROGRESSION. Thats the main thing. Deathwing was not great end battle. Far from it. It was as epic as killing hogger. The RPG elements of WOW are dying. And thats why the game is going down as well. Progression needs to be balanced and not come in jumps every 5 months when Subs are going down. Thats shamfull to think about.[COLOR=&quot;red&quot;]</div></div><hr />

Not even remotely close, and yes I play both games. Rift only starts similar to wow familiarity is not a bad thing, questing is typical for an MMO unless you account for ... Swtor, which I try to ignore cause I hate that game, its so boring. Rift as a game does so much more than Blizzard, things Blizzard would never do nor consider doing and it's sad because I would love some of the options in WoW. Like the ability to hide different pieces of armor of my choice, (Helm, boots, chest, shoulders, legs.) it makes building a personal look a lot better.</div></div><hr />

After Cata I'm dubious whether they can. I believe they should make super easy dungeon modes for causals and brutally hard modes for the hardcore, give the hard modes achievements and some unique rewards over the super easy modes. Not game changing rewards maybe mounts and a few gear upgrades but don't allow them to be used in PvP which is what a lot of people complain about. Let them use it in raids so they can show them of (if they want to) And stop allowing legendary weapons in pvp. let them use them in raids to complete objectives but don't allow them to smash people in pvp.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The difference is what is acceptable as a content patch in an expansion and what is acceptable in an expansion pack. As much as people complain now, the complaints would be much worse if we got the overhauls we see from one expansion to the next in a single patch cycle. Things need time to mature and grow, then can you see what went wrong and what worked. Knee-jerk reactions are never good, and Blizzard know this from experience.</div></div><hr />

I knew people who left at the end of WotLK because the game was no longer challenging. I knew people who left at the start of Cata because content was too hard.<br />
<br />
Are there 12 million, 13 million, 14 million people who can all be happy in one single mmo with (reasonably) equal subs across continents? I really don't think so. If WoW goes over 11 million again in MoP I will be hugely surprised. It's one thing to have over 10 million people on a tightly focused game where the majority of content comes from the users (ie pvp -- halo, LoL that stuff), but a mmo where most of your content comes from the devs. . . .ehhhh, you really can't please everyone. I loved Cata, still do. I know there's several people for whom the experience was so bad that they're waiting on the sidelines hoping Blizzard burns down to the ground for what they went through (or at least that's what it seems like). Different people, you know?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">themightysven</div><div class="date">2012-03-08, 03:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The problem was that we had this whole group of players who felt like they couldn’t make any progress on their characters. Even if they wanted to end up raiding with their friends, they couldn’t earn the gear they needed to get into those raids (especially in the absence of Raid Finder). I don’t believe that the instances were too hard; it’s obvious there are players who enjoy that content. I believe the problem was that there were no alternatives. With such a diverse community, the goal is to have experiences that players from all over the spectrum can enjoy. We don’t want to shut anyone out. So, we’re addressing that with Challenge Modes in Mists. You’ll have normal and heroic mode dungeons, and then Challenge Modes, for players who are looking to prove their mettle. Likewise, you’ll have normal and heroic raids, and Raid Finder for players who don’t enjoy wiping on a boss week after week until they can master it. I have some qualms with this statement. Heroic difficulty wasn't what was hard, what was hard was having the only upgrade for half of your slots dropping only from optional bosses. What was hard was finishing the last zone and being no where near equipped for heroics, then having to grind the same 3 normals, not for the drops, because your dungeon gear dropped from the four dungeons that would give you gear lower than your first quest reward in TH, but for the JP so you could buy gear to do heroics in. <br />
As with many cancelled features, it somehow took on a life of its own in the minds of players. Believe me, though -- you just don’t cancel things that you think are going to be awesome. It was three bosses inside Nespirah, with no unique art. then the solution would be to make new art, or better encounters wouldn't it? Also, why would it be in Nespirah? that doesn't make a tiny shred of sense... <br />
(For my money, the zone I am personally saddest about cancelling is not Abyssal Maw; it was the Azjol-Nerub quest zone in Wrath of the Lich King.) nice, bring up that dagger in our sides again. Oh, wait, didn't you just release a patch that could have included Azjol-Nerub as a staging area/dailies zone for Dragon Soul? or did I imagine that? If anything his post has made me more skeptical about WoW in the future, because he seems to be misunderstanding peoples complaints, and not seeing opportunities that present themselves.</div></div><hr />

Rift as a game does so much more than Blizzard, things Blizzard would never do nor consider doing and it's sad because I would love some of the options in WoW. Like the ability to hide different pieces of armor of my choice, (Helm, boots, chest, shoulders, legs.) it makes building a personal look a lot better.<br />
<br />
<br />
This is a discussion about Wow. I wish the people who play the clones stick to their own forums. And just to be objective. Rift LOST 80% of its players in just one year. 67% of their servers were deleted, of the remaining 16(!) US servers half of them are low on prime time and so, I wonder what you would have said if Wow lost 9 million subscriptions in ... 2011 and still would brag about it.<br />
<br />
Btw hiding equipment in Wow like helms, cloaks etc could be done in Wow 2004 already, transmog transforms any gear into what you like, so I am convinced you are not even an active Wow player at all. You just want to promote the dull small copycat once more (in fact it is what Trion has been doing for a full year now ... With only an embarassing and massive loss of Rift players as an end result).<br />
<br />

On topic: GC ANALYSED the state of the game perfectly. A pity the subscription based games have a hard time these days against the free to play garbage.... But first that garbage of a Wow competition has to be cleaned up anyway, so people see the difference between a new Wow expansion and the usual money grabbing copycats.<br />
<br />
I am sure the seamless world of Pandaria will blow the socks off of many players and the usual frustration by the Wow haters will reach epic proportions once again.</div></div><hr />

if their concept of &quot;more content&quot; remains as &quot;a bunch of dailies that you need to do 200 times&quot; then they can put out as much of that as they want; it will still blow. what they have done with DMF doesnt suggest to me that they understand the difference between content that you do because you want pets/mounts/gear and content that you do because its fun, and games are supposed to be fun.<br />
<br />
nothing about Cata, and the way it has gone, tells me that Blizzard REALLY undertand exactly what they have broken and how to fix it. which is why they are throwing out so many things like the 1 year subscription and the improved SoR to try and artificially prop up the subscriber numbers. they can say &quot;dont worry, MoP will be fun&quot; as many times as they like, but they said the same thing about Cata and got it badly wrong. i will trust what i see, not what a company desperate to maintain its income tells me is going to happen.</div></div><hr />

I have to agree with this. I'm not one of those people that claim the expansions get worse and worse (Imo Cataclysm was a way better expansion than the WotLK snorefest, and really guys, TBC wasn't as awesome as you guys seem to remember it as? Everyone was whining their asses off back then as well....)<br />
<br />
I love the addition of LFR for my alts. I can log on them and hop into a raid whenever I want, and for someone who has only limited time to play his alts that's very valuable.<br />
<br />
That said, LFR kind of destroyed my interest in the higher tiers of raiding. I raid in a fairly decent 25m hc guild, and thanks to LFR we already saw 50% of the DS content in the first 45 minutes of the first raid on the first day of 4.3. Would've been 100% if the 2nd half of DS was ready yet. Going back in to do it over again with some extra hp and shit was a tad boring.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Do people honestly believe MOP will be anyway different or better than what has come in recent times. Or is it just wishful thinking that they put out things from GC, a post about all the things people knew already and which they blatantly ignored through the exp and prior to its release.<br />
Let's get it out their as fast as possible as sure if it goes to crap as usual people will still play and we got their money from the exp/collectors editions/subscriptions.<br />
<br />
They will literally say ANYTHING to keep people hopeful of what MOP might bring an imo it will be more of the same crap. They want to keep the money coming in but seem to be unwilling to do what is necessary in order to make it so people want to stay. Of course its a company and they want people to buy their product etc etc.<br />
Some of the things they are throwing out suggest to me that it will be lacking in actual content again, more rehashed dungeons/raids and fast nerfs after the top 5/10 guilds kill the boss. And it will be more along the lines of stand around in or outside your factions capital and battle pets or grind for weeks to get another ingame pet/mount.<br />
That in essence is fine but it seems more time is being spent on 'addons' to the game than actual content. <br />
<br />
And from watching the blizzcon Q&amp;A's.. I have little faith in these guys, they come across in many questions as geeks on a power trip, looking down on people who come with legitimate questions. When someone challenges them in any form they go into politician mode and answer something totally off topic and wait for the sycophants in the audience to laugh with them to reinforce them up on the stage.<br />

<br />
No wow isn't 'dying' as it will always have people playing as long as servers are active.. and by playing i mean rolling alts or afking in org/storm, but it's fallen flat on its ass. To believe otherwise is just wishful thinking. <br />
It just amazes me how people bite onto anything they dangle in front of us anymore. <br />
<br />
I wonder sometimes do they actually want to do these things.. like they make a list of 10 awesome things to do for the next exp and its taken to whomever and they veto pretty much everything on the list and give them a new list drawn on the back of a napkin in crayon -_-</div></div><hr />

He says message received, but apparently only the first part of people who want the game to be easier. Why is he so daft to understand we dont want difficult modes for stupid senseless 5man dungeons, but instead we want difficult and UNNERFED heroic raids? Why do they insist on continuing on this path of balancing every single raid encounter on 5 difficulties, even tho they fully realise how severely it limits the amount of content they can put out, and 4 out of 5 modes are completely worthless to raiders because they're either too easy (LFR/Normal) or on the same lockout (10/25)? When will they finally replace this twerp by someone who wants to put the epic back in wow instead of casualling everything down to be accessible by everyone after 2 weeks (or the very day it gets released)?<br />

What he says about legendaries is a complete joke aswell. Blizzard has said in the past already, before dragonwrath, before cataclysm, that legendaries needed to be legendary - not obtainable by everyone. Then they make an expansion where everyone and their granny is able to get the caster &quot;legendary&quot;, followed by an instance where basically the only thing you need to do to get the legendary is get to the 4th boss and have 10k gold. But no worries! In the future, legendaries will be legendary again! What a joke.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What you say it is true. However, it means that either Ghostcrawler has lied to us (I don't believe it) when Heroics got nerfed, after he told us to learn to play, or that he holds no true power of*decisions*making inside Blizzard, which is something I believe more. We can only assume.<br />

So we can arrive at the conclusion Ghostcrawler is just a PR, trying to lessen the damage done by this expansion and*particularly*this last patch. <br />

As with many cancelled features, it somehow took on a life of its own in the minds of players. Believe me, though -- you just don’t cancel things that you think are going to be awesome. It was three bosses inside Nespirah, with no unique art. The reason it was originally appealing to us was because we had so many Vashj’ir assets that we could use. is he actually serious? And what do they call DS then. Whole DS is one derpfest of rehash and reused models not to mention the environments &gt;_&gt; with exception of spine and maddness. <br />
But by the time it was time to do the work, we felt like we (and many players) had Vashj’ir fatigue. Really? personally I liked vasjír it was one of the most interesting zones, together with Deepholm. I haven't visited the forums a lot in the last year but where players really tired of vashj'ir?</div></div><hr />

This interview has gotten me more excited by MoP.<br />
<br />
Does not compute.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
So many people on here just buy into everything that blizzard say/announce without so much as a small bit of thought process or a look at the companies history or big promises and failing to deliver.<br />
<br />
Do people honestly believe MOP will be anyway different or better than what has come in recent times. Or is it just wishful thinking that they put out things from GC, a post about all the things people knew already and which they blatantly ignored through the exp and prior to its release.<br />
Let's get it out their as fast as possible as sure if it goes to crap as usual people will still play and we got their money from the exp/collectors editions/subscriptions.<br />
<br />
They will literally say ANYTHING to keep people hopeful of what MOP might bring an imo it will be more of the same crap. They want to keep the money coming in but seem to be unwilling to do what is necessary in order to make it so people want to stay. Of course its a company and they want people to buy their product etc etc.<br />
Some of the things they are throwing out suggest to me that it will be lacking in actual content again, more rehashed dungeons/raids and fast nerfs after the top 5/10 guilds kill the boss. And it will be more along the lines of stand around in or outside your factions capital and battle pets or grind for weeks to get another ingame pet/mount.<br />
That in essence is fine but it seems more time is being spent on 'addons' to the game than actual content.<br />
<br />
And from watching the blizzcon Q&amp;A's.. I have little faith in these guys, they come across in many questions as geeks on a power trip, looking down on people who come with legitimate questions. When someone challenges them in any form they go into politician mode and answer something totally off topic and wait for the sycophants in the audience to laugh with them to reinforce them up on the stage.<br />
<br />
<br />
No wow isn't 'dying' as it will always have people playing as long as servers are active.. and by playing i mean rolling alts or afking in org/storm, but it's fallen flat on its ass. To believe otherwise is just wishful thinking.<br />
It just amazes me how people bite onto anything they dangle in front of us anymore.<br />
<br />
I wonder sometimes do they actually want to do these things.. like they make a list of 10 awesome things to do for the next exp and its taken to whomever and they veto pretty much everything on the list and give them a new list drawn on the back of a napkin in crayon -_- <br />
<br />
This ^<br />
<br />
GC is doing what he always does nowadays, which is BS'ing you guys hard. Really hard. And you guys eat it up. No less than a dozen posters on here simply saying &quot;Oh his previous interviews he sounded like he was lying but this one was honest!&quot;. No it isn't. It's really not. You're being suckered yet again. Several key parts of the &quot;cookie cutter&quot; interview: 1. Admit things didn't go as planned 2. Tell you a reason they didn't work (not the real reason of course) 3. Use language that downplays the strengths of the 'old' way, emphasizes on the strengths of the 'new' way 4. And finally use language that is really nothing more than a empty promises. We &quot;want&quot; to do this, we &quot;hope&quot; that this works like this.<br />
<br />
Or do you guys really believe <br />
The Mists talent design is a major revamp that should fix this problem once and for all. ?<br />
Come on now.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cerbul</div><div class="date">2012-03-08, 10:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">For Blizzard.<br />
1. Offering content for more types of players won't solve the problem about players asking for something harder or less hard.What players are really asking is to receive rewards that they can SHOW OFF as a proof of performance. Every raid should have 1 mount, 1 title, 1 item set that is MORE AWESOME then the easier to get one. Obviously, all players want a reward for what they can achieve, but those who put the effort, want something to DISTINGUISH themselves from the casuals, so that they have something to be proud of.<br />
2. GIVE DUAL/MULTI-REFORGE SYSTEM!<br />
3. About Abysal Maw, you are missing the point entirely. I did the zone for 2 out of 3 alts, and I regret not doing it 3 times, as the quests and the zone were awesome, and the feel of the zone is superb. But you are missing the &quot;inconvenience&quot; part, cause it was hard to travel somewhere that far, and getting back to SW. Start doing mini towns/vilages, where you get access to a bigger zone. Imagine an underwater town in middle of Abysal Maw, that have a portal to SW, and give players 2 heartstones. One for main capital, and one for questing zone. Imagine how cool would be to meet all the ppl that are questing in a zone, in a mini village where also world PVP could start becoming real.So, in other zones, divide HeartStone into CapialStone and QuestStone.<br />
4. Don't remove all opportunities to make more gold then the rest of the players, not having to fight for a specific recipe is poor design. Allow players to have gold for a single char raiding, reforging,enchanting, gemming, to the level where they don't feel like they need to grind too much, but offer opportunities for players that want to sustain serious raiding, multiple alts, mount grinding, so that they feel like they got a goal by grinding a specific recipe. The model from Wrath of the Lich King, where JC had alot of ways to receive recipes, some harder to get and some less hard, was a really nice approach, that was totally removed for Cataclysm.*You know why I feel bored at this point? Cause you removed everything from the game that I could grind for. Only achievements are left for me. You removed World Bosses, you removed special items drops tht could help get faster into raiding, you removed all the recipe grinding and replaced it with daily quests, and a lot of other things, that makes me ask myself: &quot;What else can I do to improve my character power, or my opportunities to make additional gold?&quot;Try to give into every single aspect of the game, something for players to wish for, which obviously should be harder to get. If you like current model of earning gold, trust me, it only makes sure that a casual player will have enough for raiding, but you removed everything that could give an advantage to the players that WANT to put the effort in for extra gold.<br />
5. Questing in general, seems like you learned your lesson well here. Is not the fact that some quests are too hard that make ppl less happy about doing a specific daily, *is the fact that for some items there is TOO MUCH COMPETITION, or the drop rate is too poor. However, I've seen improvements about this.<br />
6. The main reason I made this post, was to comment of the linearity of the questing zone. I don't care how many options you give to players BUT MAKE SURE I WON'T WASTE HOURS TRYING TO FIND THE NEXT QUEST. I was so upset about reaching a specific quest giver when I was about to hit level 82, but he didn't give me a level 82 quest, and 2 hours later I found myself in the situation of searching for that quest giver, as no other quest remained for me to do. This was just frustrating, as everyone else was progressing. So please, don't limit a quest giver by level UNLESS YOU MAKE SURE THERE IS NO WAY TO NOT REACH THAT LEVEL BY DOING THE MAIN QUEST LINE. Also, make sure that every single quest giver will have another one sending you to him. I don't want to search the entire map for a quest giver that no one sends you to or no one tells you to go to. How should I know that there is a quest giver somewhere otherwise? So please, if you do want to give players options, make sure they are made good enough so that you don't end up doing half of that line, or not being able to advance if you chose to skip more of them.<br />
7. Healers and raiding. If you think healers are healers just to get a raiding spot you are wrong. They are healers mainly cause they like a challenge. When you nerf bosses, DON'T NERF OVERALL DAMAGE, NERF ONLY THE CHANCES THAT A PERSON WILL DIE TO A SPECIFIC ABILITY. I assume you are well aware of the fact that tanks and dps will not get bored, but healers will do get bored cause of those nerfs. You are also aware of the fact that raid leaders will replace those healers with dps, if you make the mana requirements lower, and I don't want to sit on the bench, just because a raid leader decides that instead of a healer going offspec dps, he rather get a proper dps in.*Also, if you want players to not feel bad about you doing some nerfs, DO IT PER BOSS CASE, and not nerf everything on the same amount. Nerf every boss on particular, based on how many guilds started to not progress on that boss, even if every week will mean a nerf to a different boss. THIS IS THE ONLY WAY YOU WILL KEEP THE GAME FUN FOR THE PLAYERS THAT WANT A CHALLENGE.</div></div><hr />

Why the hell would they ? they still got 10milj subs as far as we know and going f2p would be the dumbest thing they can do with that amount of subs, they will never get that money with micro transactions, hell they double-dip now , subs and a cash shop ....<br />
The only point i can see wow going f2p is if they drop to 2-3 milj subs and even than i doubt they will.</div></div><hr />

100%. See the announcement of Diablo 3 and the MoP Beta within the next 2 weeks, with the Diablo 3 announcement being the first one and accompanied by a HUGE advertising campaign for the WoW annual pass.</div></div><hr />
