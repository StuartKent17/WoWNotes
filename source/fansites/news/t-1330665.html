Flex Difficulty Feedback<br />
Flex difficulty needs more testing and feedback (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/266125-feedback-the-underhold-flexible/), so be sure to give it a try if you have time this weekend!<br />
Many thanks for the excellent feedback thus far.<br />
<br />
On Malkorok in particular, a bit more breathing room between the final Implosions and Breath wouldn't hurt (on Normal as well), and Blood Rage is actually doing more damage than it should be for our current Flexible tuning (a bug).<br />
<br />
As for Flexible mode in general, we'll be reducing the overall difficulty relative to Normal across the board for our next PTR test. It's also quite possible (likely, even) that specific mechanics are overtuned on Normal as well, which will of course translate to excessive difficulty on Flexible as well -- we don't consider our Normal mode tuning final yet by any means. <br />
<br />
I'd like to briefly clarify Flexible mode's target audience and what that means regarding how we tune the content: Flexible mode is primarily for roughly the audience served by 10-player Normal raiding in Wrath of the Lich King (10 Normal used to be a tier lower than 25 Normal). Not every guild that raids is a raiding guild, if that makes sense. I'd say that Flexible mode is for social groups that raid; Normal mode is for raiding guilds (and Heroic is for hardcore raiding guilds). That distinction consists of factors such as whether or not the group will ever recruit based on class needs, or remove someone based on performance (or even openly criticize them). <br />
<br />
But a friends-and-family group is far from a ragtag pickup group. We're assuming that you have a leader running the show, are communicating, and are willing and able to coordinate a strategy and execute individual mechanics. Also, unlike Looking For Raid, which has a relatively flat difficulty level and which is designed to be successfully completed by all appropriately-geared players, Flexible mode entails progression. You'll learn and farm earlier fights to work your way up towards the more demanding ones deeper in the zone. A boss like Malkorok is Boss 9 of 14, and is generally designed as such. I'd compare him to bosses like Rotface or Festergut in Icecrown Citadel. Those certainly saw plenty of PUG action later in the 3.3 patch cycle, when the zone-wide Icecrown buff had ramped up a bit and the strategies were widely-known. <br />
<br />
Now, will players form PUGs for Flexible Siege of Orgrimmar? Absolutely -- and we're excited at the prospect. But that's an organic process that will evolve over time, if we get the tuning right. I don't recall very many Trade chat PUGs waltzing into Icecrown Citadel in January 2010 and killing Festergut.<br />

Blue Tweets<br />
Legendary Cloak<br />
In vanilla and every expansion before MoP we had legendary weapons to anticipate. Why isnt there any in MoP?<br />
Weren't happy with the entitlement feel of DWrath and Fangs. If we do leg weapons again, we'd likely make them much rarer. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/351125712259915776))<br />
Either forget legendaries, or accept that people want OP items, and OP for some means unbalance so make it easy..<br />
Legendary weapons are kind of OP by their nature. That's fine. Last few we just made it so every potential user could get. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/352099651396173825))<br />
<br />
I am thoroughly disappointed with the legendary being a cloak. All of this work throughout the xpac and we don't use it again.<br />
What do you mean by &quot;don't use it again?&quot; (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/350646916398325760))<br />
it disapp. me that now there's a leg. for everyone and it's a cloak thats shaped like a towel and clips models. Why no weapon?<br />
We feel like we've done that a lot before. We want to keep things fresh. When rewards are too predictable they get boring. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/350652781041946624))<br />
Precedent is the problem. Ppl expected awesome weapons. Disappointed by dish towels (however awesome they may be)<br />
Imagine the problems with this sentence: &quot;I can easily predict what WoW will do next based on precedence.&quot; (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/350700084620570625))<br />
<br />
Also is the proc. from the Tanking Cloaks working while in a DPS spec ?<br />
No, you'll have to be a legit tank to benefit from the tank proc. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356121649013207040))<br />
<br />
Why gate the new world boss using the legendary cape? Seems arbitrary and bad for alts.<br />
I still struggle to understand wanting lots of alts but not having to play them as much as a main. Isn't that the point of an alt? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/351121156637605890))<br />
<br />
Reforging<br />
And yet you think about changing reforging or even removing it.<br />
My experience is that most players just use an add on or website to tell them how to reforge. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362079429914132480))<br />
It probably works the best for healers, since sufficient regen is a feel thing, not something you can dictate. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362079614983610371))<br />
<br />
I do like reforging to make poor items (haste trink for fury war) easier to swallow. I donâ€™t like it for hit/exp though.<br />
Yeah, the cascades where getting one new item causes you to reforge all are the worst. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/361995756040761344))<br />
Do you think it's more of a hit/exp-as-a-capped-stat issue then?<br />
Certainly part of it, but we also don't like all the work that has to go into a drop before it's ready to wear. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362076733450625024))<br />
Aren't enchants and gems and valor upgrades (and maybe transmog) enough? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362076838190792704))<br />
<br />
Characters / Items<br />
how do you feel having Pandaren shared between both factions has worked out? Would you do the same if new races were added?<br />
Not a fan of it overall. We just didn't want to deny anyone Pandaren. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/360765802590384129))<br />
<br />
Was creating a humam char yday, all faces look awful! Compared with mop/cata races... new models can't get here fast enough.<br />
Yep. Pretty much. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/357514707642486784))<br />
<br />
Can you please explain to me why the tier sets for tier 16 look so bland and tasteless? &amp; why season 14 rogue looks like plate<br />
Response to tier art is so ridiculously subjective that I long ago gave up trying to understand player reaction to it. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356126100293812226))<br />
The advice I gave before is provide feedback on the kind of designs you'd like to see for future tiers and not just shout BAD. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356126257823494145))<br />
<br />
Is the current Challenge Mode gear still going to be attainable next exp, or will it go away for good??<br />
Current plan is you can still try to obtain it since it scales your gear. Not 100% sure though. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/355396072862003200))<br />
<br />
Random question, Do you think you'll ever have (8) set bonuses again?<br />
I think it's unlikely in PvE. I'm not a fan of players ignoring all pieces except tier sets. Makes loot less interesting. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/351133238955212800))<br />
<br />
What is your opinion on the fact that when everyone can get 'Epics' the term 'Epic' is cheapened.<br />
I feel like some of that is just standard mudflation. Would earning your way from blues to epics feel the same after 9 years? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/350707829054767104))<br />
<br />
of course they can be, but blizz prefers to ignore the storage space issue. Be lucky to see a fix even next xpac.<br />
We aren't ignoring it. We just don't believe near infinite storage is necessary. We don't like e.g. 100 slot bags. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/361063871890468864))<br />
<br />
PTR notes: RPPM proc rates for items that proc haste, wont benefit from haste to proc more?? huh?<br />
The interaction of RPPM with haste made those mechanics more powerful than intended. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/363733532511703040))<br />
We had cases where RPPM trinkets were a 10%+ damage increase and situations where no non-RPPM trinket would ever compete. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/363733719732854784))<br />
<br />
Any chance of Void Storage ever having the deposit cost removed? That's why I never use it. Withdraw makes more sense.<br />
Transmog was originally conceived as a way to wear older tier sets. It has grown into much more though. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362008458972774400))<br />
Given that, we don't think the current UI necessarily supports the feature as well as it could. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362008606356414464))<br />

Computers - Setup of the Month (by chaud (http://www.mmo-champion.com/members/523085-chaud))<br />
Each month or every 2 months, depending on the hardware evolutions, the lovely chaud (http://www.mmo-champion.com/members/523085-chaud) will work on a couple of hardware setups for those of you who are thinking of upgrading their computer!<br />
<br />
This month<br />
The current SSD prices (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2013/august/ssdgraph.gif) are stable, with most SSDs under $1 per gigabyte when on sale.<br />
<br />
The new Haswell CPUs from Intel are here (http://www.anandtech.com/show/7003/the-haswell-review-intel-core-i74770k-i54560k-tested/1) and they run a little bit on the warmer side. Depending on how much you want to overclock, you may need to spend a bit more for a better CPU cooler like the NH-D14 (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002VKVZ1A?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mmochamp-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002VKVZ1A) or H90 (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00B4OCWDE?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mmochamp-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00B4OCWDE). <br />
<br />
Unless you are doing a lot of video rendering or something that is similarly multithreaded, you do not need the 4770K and should spend that money elsewhere.<br />
<br />
Make sure to keep your AMD (http://sites.amd.com/us/game/downloads/Pages/downloads.aspx) and Nvidia (http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us) drivers up to date.<br />

Weekly News Recap<br />
Another busy week full of news, so here is your chance to catch up! <br />
<br />
<br />
August 4<br />
<br />
We looked at a preview of the Garrosh fight (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3329-Garrosh-Preview-Lesser-Charms-in-the-In-Game-Store-Blue-Tweets-Weekly-News-Recap) in Siege of Orgrimmar.<br />
Bulging Bag of Charms (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/103535-bulging-bag-of-charms) was added to the store on the PTR.<br />
<br />
August 5<br />
<br />
We got an update on Virtual Realms (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3330-Patch-5-4-Feature-Preview-Connected-Realms), now renamed to Connected Realms.<br />
<br />
August 6<br />
<br />
We looked at the chests on Timeless Isle (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3331-Timeless-Isle-Chests-Epic-Gems-Aug-6-Raid-Testing-Blue-Posts-Burdens-of-Shaohao). These chests drop item level 496 tokens for gear (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3321), as well as the rare Burden of Eternity (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/103982-burden-of-eternity) to upgrade that gear to 535. You can find a detailed guide here (http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/1328815-In-depth-Timeless-Isle-Hidden-Chest-Guide!) on the forums.<br />
There will be no epic gems in Patch 5.4 (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/363402119971217408).<br />
We got more detailed information about the changes coming to Vengeance (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3331-Timeless-Isle-Chests-Epic-Gems-Aug-6-Raid-Testing-Blue-Posts-Burdens-of-Shaohao).<br />
There was a new PTR build with Patch 5.4 music (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3332-Patch-5-4-PTR-Build-17271), along with class changes and some new items.<br />
<br />
August 7<br />
<br />
The new PTR build was applied, showing us that the weapons that drop from Garrosh are level 90 to 100 BoA Heirlooms (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3333-5-4-Heirloom-Raid-Weapons-5-4-Notes-Update-SoO-Raid-Testing-Blue-Tweets-HS-Update).<br />
The official PTR notes were updated with some more class changes (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3333-5-4-Heirloom-Raid-Weapons-5-4-Notes-Update-SoO-Raid-Testing-Blue-Tweets-HS-Update).<br />
The Hearthstone team posted an updated on the state of the game (http://www.hearthpwn.com/news/95-hearthstone-state-of-the-game).<br />
<br />
August 8<br />
<br />
We looked at some of the items sold by the Timeless Isle vendors (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3334-Timeless-Isle-Vendors-Pet-Cap-Increase-Class-Tuning-Blue-Tweets-Burden-of-Shaohao), including item level 535 trinkets (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/armor/trinkets?filter-green-text=8), Heavenly Golden Cloud Serpent (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/87774-reins-of-the-heavenly-golden-cloud-serpent), and the Censer of Eternal Agony (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/102467-censer-of-eternal-agony).<br />
Patch 5.4 will increase the cap on pets to 1,000 (https://twitter.com/mumper/status/365642051825582080).<br />
Sometime in the next week or two it will be time to start balancing the numbers on the PTR (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/364852604267798528).<br />
<br />
August 9<br />
<br />
We looked at the rewards from Bloody Coins, farmed by killing other players on the Timeless Isle. These include things like the Ashhide Mushan Beast (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/103638-reins-of-the-ashhide-mushan-beast) and Vengeful Porcupette (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/103637-vengeful-porcupette).<br />
Base Resilience and Battle Fatigue (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/134735-battle-fatigue) will be increased (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/365956913369849858) in one of the upcoming PTR builds.<br />
The Celestial Blessings (http://www.wowdb.com/quests/32805-celestial-blessings) quest has been hotfixed to be easier for Yu'lon or Xuen's Celestial Challenge.<br />
Several sections will be removed from the WoW website (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/266096-website-cleanup-incoming/) this week.<br />
The final part of the Burdens of Shaohao series (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D--GWwca0g&amp;list=PLY0KbDiiFYeNKrf7yg1O5KsHff-NdimhR) was released. Be sure to let Blizzard know if you want to see more like this in the future!</div></div><hr />

Also legendaries need to be changed. Switching mains to fill a need in a progression guild is almost suicide due to how much impact the meta and cloak account for unless you devoted 5 days a week to keeping up with alts either via LFR or alt runs. To be quite honest they should just be scrapped entirely because it's just one more thing they fail to balance encounters around.</div></div><hr />

You are aware that all raid tiers have dropped cloaks of varying natures, correct? The legendary isn't the &quot;only&quot; cloak available, nor is it something you'd be able to otherwise get the FIRST day patch 5.3 rolls out.</div></div><hr />

I still struggle to understand wanting lots of alts but not having to play them as much as a main. Isn't that the point of an alt?&quot;<br />
<br />
This man is trying very hard to make me dislike him. It has been many, many years that I have watched the WoW community attack him for every single change that goes wrong with this game and not once have I blamed it on him. Yet with this tweet he is essentially saying he doesn't understand his own game.<br />
<br />
The idea of alts is to have something you can enjoy playing while your main has hit all of the random, stupid, pointless and arbitrary caps that Blizzard has set for a character's progression per week. However, most people who raid don't have the luxury of &quot;alt runs&quot; or server populations conducive to pugging raids, hence it becomes extremely difficult, time consuming and tedious to have to continously repeat the same grind for a legendary cloak that allows you to fight a boss you should already be able to fight. It makes no sense whatsoever at this stage of the game to not have the cloak be an account-wide flag to allow access to the boss. The RNG grind for sigils and runestones and secrets and all that rubbish is bad enough the first time (not to mention completely uninteresting, uninspired rubbish that you would expect to find in leveling quests, not legendary questlines) and is not something they should expect people to do twice, let alone three or four times if you have several alts.</div></div><hr />

So? You can't &quot;instantly&quot; get the legendary cloak; you'll likely have seen your cloak drop in between now and actually obtaining the number of whatevers from SoO required to upgrade it. Nor would this one cloak, even in legendary form, make up for otherwise poor gear...

Well, the 'one eye' thing has been done in rogue tier already(Icecrown Citadel Rogue tier). The appearance is actually more 'paladin' like as far as 'light' and that platelike look to it.<br />
<br />
Edit: Personally, I don't mind it, I think it looks nice, and I think they were going for more of a 'sentinel' look. and if you really want to stretch the imagination....it's a big laser sight for shooting!....lol, I don't think that was intended though...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because when a new tier comes out, you can't possibly avoid wearing it's look. Gee, if there were only some magical system that let you change the look of armor pieces, perhaps into old sets that you might like more... <br />
<br />
If only such a powerful system existed that allowed people to not have to wear the most current tier of gear, and instead could wear an outfit you had previously assembled that you liked. I mean, people always say the old tiers were better... wouldn't it be great if there was some way to wear their look again...<br />
<br />
<br />
But as far as I know, no such system exists in game. So you're right, Blizzard is just bending people over their knee so they HAVE to buy whatever new gear set would come out on the cash shop, as there's simply no other way to wear a good looking set of armor. <br />

We're soon nearing 16 tier sets. That's over 128 slots (incl offset items) without even counting weapons if you happen to have all tiers. In most cases that's a full bank. Just for tiers.</div></div><hr />

You can't &quot;instantly&quot; get the legendary cloak; you'll likely have seen your cloak drop in between now and actually obtaining the number of whatevers from SoO required to upgrade it. Nor would this one cloak, even in legendary form, make up for otherwise poor gear... Are you going to bench a person in your dedicated heroic raid team in favor of a guy you saw parading around in the cloak and LFR gear?<br />
<br />
Uhh according to Lore you're supposed to and that's pretty much the point.<br />
<br />
You severely underestimate or moreso have no idea how much of an impact the cloak and the meta have on player performance and thus progression as a whole. If you don't have it you're going to be so far behind everyone else and thus hampering your progression. It's not just something that once you have it you go &quot;oh it's cool I only gimped my raid for 3 months of SoO progression just to get my secrets&quot;<br />
<br />
I never said anything about benching anyone. I said that anyone forced to main switch for progression reasons is immediately gimped unless they decided to run LFR into the ground every week on more than one toon and that the legendary &quot;system&quot; needs to be scrapped or legendaries need to be done away with entirely.<br />
<br />
In the progression game it's a must have. There's no way around it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Slappyjoe</div><div class="date">2013-08-12, 02:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Because when a new tier comes out, you can't possibly avoid wearing it's look. Gee, if there were only some magical system that let you change the look of armor pieces, perhaps into old sets that you might like more... <br />
<br />
If only such a powerful system existed that allowed people to not have to wear the most current tier of gear, and instead could wear an outfit you had previously assembled that you liked. I mean, people always say the old tiers were better... wouldn't it be great if there was some way to wear their look again...<br />
<br />
<br />
But as far as I know, no such system exists in game. So you're right, Blizzard is just bending people over their knee so they HAVE to buy whatever new gear set would come out on the cash shop, as there's simply no other way to wear a good looking set of armor. <br />
<br />
...wait a second...<br />
<br />
If you'll step out of your cloud of sarcasm for just a moment you might realize that people like getting new gear in a game largely based around getting new gear. If that new gear doesn't fit what they typically get for their class, of course they're going to say something about it. The whole &quot;just use transmog&quot; excuse is tired and really dumb. Yeah, transmog is a great feature and yeah, if I don't like a new tier set I can use it so I don't have to look at it. But can you seriously not understand people's desire to like a shiny new set of gear and not have to transmog it into something they've already seen?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why do we hunters need plate looking complicated armor? Less is more. Simplicity is beautiful. They should focus on what a hunter requires. Two shoulderpads wouldn't really be worn. Maybe go with the single shoulderpad design....for ease of accessibility while firing. Leather would play a huge part in the design. A hood. Hell....you can even make it so we have a scope over one eye. No dangling pieces. That would not suit well in a hunt. Definitely NO HEAVY LOOKING EQUIPMENT. Don't have one solid chest piece - only need half of our chest covered so that it's not in the way for archery. Amazon women cut off a breast so it wouldn't hinder their archery why can't we do the same with the armor?</div></div><hr />

Can you please explain to me why the tier sets for tier 16 look so bland and tasteless? &amp; why season 14 rogue looks like plate<br />
Response to tier art is so ridiculously subjective that I long ago gave up trying to understand player reaction to it. (Source)<br />
The advice I gave before is provide feedback on the kind of designs you'd like to see for future tiers and not just shout BAD. (Source)<br />
<br />
I've got your answer! Make Hunter gear look hunter like and Rogue gear more Rogue like!!! etc. <br />
I think it may be time to find a new design staff for tier sets.</div></div><hr />

It's like a one-eyed ogre married a sunflower and had a baby near a mine node in Vale of Eternal Blossoms.<br />
<br />
People want to look epic! Not like a robot or whatever that is. You know what... the guys creating these concepts should make cosplays of each set and get out on the streets. Then ask people around what they think of it, what they relate those figures with. I doubt any one would say hunter, or epic, or even mention that they would wear it too. It has a clown feeling to it that makes it silly before cool and desirable.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I know art is subjective (and that's a problem, especially because of this.) You guys need to get the art department for your current PVP sets back to designing these. Or re-purpose their positions and hire new people. I've been happy with most sets for eight years. (Except for t12) but the t16 sets are probably the worst possible designs. It's not that they just look bad, they look (particularly in the case of this one and the Monk+Rogue ones) half-assed and underfinished.<br />
<br />
If you want people to use these sets instead of using transmog, please put more effort into the sets. You have the ability and the capability! I hope what seems like community backlash for most of these sets helps you realize!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sigh. Please actually read and think things through before responding. &quot;wtf did you hunt to make&quot;. <br />
<br />
T1 says giants. Looks nothing like giants, the only thing that even suggests giants is the name. What we actually get are huge arbitrarily shaped solid metal shoulders and a similar helm. It looks nothing like a 'hunter set', more warrior if anything.<br />
<br />
T2 does look like dragons. Which is why I didn't include it in the list.<br />
<br />
T3 is inspired by cryptfiends, clearly, but it's not as if it's made from them. It's more metal made to look a little like cryptfiends. So, no, still stands.<br />
<br />
T4 is again, inspired by demons, but only even then very roughly. It has the right colour scheme of the fel iron constructs in Outland and it has some fel green glow but that's it. It's not made from hunted demons, just has a vague demonic resemblance.<br />
<br />
T5 and T6 do look like they were pieced together by parts of the actual creatures, so I didn't include them - so no need to respond to those.<br />
<br />
T7 - again, same issue as T3.<br />
<br />
T8 - you said it yourself, didn't hunt scourge to make the gear. <br />
<br />
T9 - again, didn't hunt anything to make gear.<br />
<br />
T10, T11, T12, T13, T14 and T15 all resemble creatures enough for them to look like they've been made by the creatures that have been hunted, at least in part. Which is why I didn't include them.<br />
<br />
So, like I said, the tiers I mentioned still stand as examples of sets that were not &quot;hunted&quot; to make the gear from. The only reason I've been so pernickety about whether the armour was made from what was hunted is because the poster I replied to asked &quot;wtf did we hunt to make this armor&quot;.</div></div><hr />
