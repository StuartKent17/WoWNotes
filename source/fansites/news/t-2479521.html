What's the point of data mining? We already know all the content that's in it since it's a 14 year old version lol. WhT is there to datamine? There aren't any new dialogues or models or anything. It's a recreation.</div></div><hr />

End of June early july for 8.2, puts classic at probably late Aug early Sep. to make the &quot;summer&quot; deadline easy.<br />

Blizzard disagrees with you:<br />
<br />
https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-11-04-wow-classic-blizzard-answers-some-of-the-big-questions<br />
<br />
Are you expecting players to come back to vanilla WOW and properly invest in that game, or just have a look around for nostalgia's sake?<br />
<br />
J. Allen Brack: Both, I think. One of the things we do know is that by announcing this, we're in the WOW Classic business forever. Once that starts, there's a commitment on our end that we're going to continue maintaining those servers for as long as there is a World of Warcraft. I think there will be people that come and do the nostalgia trip, they go to the Barrens and find Mankrik's wife, and then they're done. That's fine. Some amount of people, however, are going to create a new Classic community and that's what we'll be providing.<br />
<br />
Those people don't just want the old gameplay features, they want the constant social connection. And so we can't just support it for a couple of months and then if it's not working out, ditch it. There has to be an assurance that you can build this character, build this guild, build these friendships, and the server will continue.</div></div><hr />

You got it backwards. One great thing about Classic is you don't play latest patch, there are no dailies, there is no fake progression at max level, so you can play at your own pace. It is much more casual friendly than retail. Classic proper MMORPG &gt; Retail achievement/collections gathering emulator with few remaining RPG elements.</div></div><hr />

Exactly, I've been playing on one of those hmm servers the last 4 months and I've enjoyed that a hell of a lot more than the last 6 years of retail. I can't wait for progression to actually mean something, funny how a drop of a green item can make your day, or the creation of an item through your profession (you do know professions right ? Its that thing that has been a mess for years and years!) can make your enjoyment that much better. Bring on Classic I've been waiting for it since it's announcement.</div></div><hr />

I can't understand it either. Even IF you needed to adjust the game engine to 2019 standards/systems/drivers/libraries it shouldn't take more than few (2-3) months for a qualified game dev studio. It seems like generating fake hype or delaying as much as they can, because they don't want to divide the playerbase further between retail and classic.</div></div><hr />

Only software developers will understand. Back then it was a stand alone program running on Windows XP and installed from CD, since then things have moved on... the delivery of content, bug fixes, the way you sign on, the hardware and OS you run it on.</div></div><hr />

Because they're not just rereleasing classic as it was, they're rebuilding classic on the modern engine. They don't have a lot of assets and some stuff they're building entirely off videos and reports from back in the day. And it's not a huge dev team like retail</div></div><hr />

I'm an IT engineer (not a software developer mind you) and I still say it's delay tactics. They have a 2005/6 build - just make it work on newer OS + bug fixes (which they know how to fix by now). Modders do shit like this all the time, not to mention gog.com. I don't believe they needed 18 months of development time to release classic. You could've make a new game in that time with resources Blizzard has. I understand the team is smaller, but still - they HAVE the build and the assets.</div></div><hr />

You are living in a dream world. They have all the assets, effects and data/scripts. Because otherwise they would not be able to defend their IP if someone starts to use them like copy/paste from the Classic client into a new game...<br />

No, there are too many wannabe armchair developer kids with no real experience.<br />
<br />
You don't know how complex their system is, if data can be changed from old format to new format, how many tweaks to modern client need to be done to make it work with old data, what it takes to make new engine emulate old rules. I'm sure it is very complex.<br />
<br />
They actually did some presentation a while ago showing how different data is and explaining why it can't be automated. When things can't be automated due to engines being completely incompatible, they require massive amounts of manual labor to test and tweak everything.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, they showed how poorly a lot of things were done back in the day. We have to remember that vanilla was made by a bunch of amatuers doing their first MMO ever, it was a mess</div></div><hr />

The biggest challenge is that things like their interfaces between the model engine and the data have changed dramatically during Cataclysm's development. And their release system had to be reorganised so that they weren't delivering a Cata landscape as well as Classic. Simple things like the coordinate system being different such that they had to translate a bunch of stuff, and of course then painstakingly check that every tree was at ground level, and there was water in every pond etc.<br />
<br />
Likely a handful of people spent a week in every single zone just comparing the clients, let alone the time to fix all the issues they found. I *am* a software developer, and we still have parts of our codebase that are older than WoW. When it came to moving our product into the Cloud, we gave up trying to convert and are rewriting the entire product. I'd hate to have to do the work they've been gracious enough to do.</div></div><hr />

There is no release date. The beta is there to figure that out. They will let people play it and then if we find 435345 things that need fixing it will take longer. If people think its great again, it will release sooner.</div></div><hr />

You even explain it to them, and it still flies over their heads. But, I don't really blame them...until I started working in software development, I had no idea how messy and slow it can be.

And this is why you are an IT engineer.<br />
They are not using 2005/06 build since it was full of flaws and the new client is much more optimized and better, also runs on current OS-s no problem, and server side for that version is long gone.<br />

Also, they are not only working on a client side but also on a server side. They ditched old algorithms long time ago, and now they face the challenge of recreating them, and try to not break something. They didn't even have a normalized database (lol) for the old client.<br />
And this is why, the process is taking &quot;long&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Well you have a point and a good one :p No catch up mechanics so you can slowly progress through content. But I remember aswell that amount of consumable you needed to have for progression was enourmous, mana oils, mana regen food, potions were on 2 min cd and you could chain them ( I was using superior instead of major bcuz money :p ),buff regeants, blasted lands buff + flasks for tru progress. Now its easier, and classes are more balanced, I would rly love to try classic again but got a wife/kid and cant do it :p Cant play slowly, would probably nolife through content, and I would miss all the good things modern wow has like being able to summon in instances or lfg tool or even cross realm instances/raids, I played on low pop realm in classic :p</div></div><hr />

Then you'd be wrong. They've done a whole explain on how complex it has been - remember they couldn't even get the original code to work at all. They are effectively porting the stuff to the current platform and reverse engineering how everything worked.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Just make it work on newer OS + bug fixes&quot; and that's why you're not anywhere near such IT projects.<br />
<br />
I'd suggest actually diving into development and thinking about what has to be done for a project such as this. Small hint;<br />
<br />
1.) Completely different hardware<br />
2.) Completely different Operating Systems<br />
3.) Completely different launcher<br />
4.) Completely different patching system<br />
etc<br />
etc<br />

That list is indeed huge, but it concerns only cutting edge guilds.<br />
<br />
Casual guilds didn't bother with most of that and if you remove big expensive stuff, its not a big list.<br />
<br />
I used to heal back then on priest in rather casual guild that was like 5th on realm. Mana potions were the only real concern. Oils and food were easy to come by because I did like fishing. Buff reagents were never an issue because they were cheap compared to other stuff.<br />
<br />
There is massive difference in mentality and game play back then and today. Today buffs are treated as mandatory, so Blizzard streamlined everything. It was streamlined to point that it no longer feels like there is any preparation to do. Potions and buff food are nothing today, flasks are easy to purchase with money game throws on players everywhere and that's it. Today all players have same preparation for raids, regardless of being casual or hardcore.<br />
<br />
Back then players had choice - be casual and don't bother with that or be hardcore and spend a lot of time preparing for raids. Vast majority of players played casually. Less than 1% were affected by long grind.</div></div><hr />

We just expect a game that isn't a total dumpster fire like the game has been since Cataclysm.<br />

I expect to feel about it how I did in late Vanilla, but with the fact of having to start afresh bringing a tiny bit of that original magic back, however briefly.<br />

You don't know *how* close I am to what IT projects, but please continue projecting.<br />
I'm completely aware of the things you listed, but it still shouldn't take 18 months for AAA dev team. Stop strawmanning and think for a second. They have all the needed assets, they have the old engine (which is still, even in retail, heavily modified old engine) and most of all - they have experience with their own engine. They could've just make the game again with all the resources they have in 12 months. If you think &quot;patching systems&quot; or &quot;different launcher&quot; is a problem for a software/database engineer to fix in more than a week then I don't think this discussion will go anywhere.<br />
<br />
It's all Okcham's razor - what's more probable:<br />
1) they're taking 18 months to re-release a VERSION of a game they've already made long time ago (now having much more experience). <br />
2) they want to strategically release the game when retail will be suffering a major, annual player drop-off while building the hype for Classic?<br />

Don't forget that it's not only a code and done project. They also had to figure out how to convert their old database to more modern ones, modify the way they communicate with their database, plan the content release, actually code the different patches, plan and code new servers that are more modern and all that on top of QA and bug fixing + conversion to support battle.net. And that is just the tip of the iceberg since we're not part of the company. We don't know what's going on over there. Also, there might be 10-15 actual devs on the team compared to a full AAA one as you mentioned with 50-200 devs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Are you guessing the difficulty of the proposed work?<br />
<br />
If yes, then are you a programmer?<br />
<br />
If yes, then have you actually seen the code?<br />
<br />
If no, then you should know better than to claim how easy something is to implement.<br />
<br />
The basic TLDR here is that you should never assume the difficulty of something you know nothing about. And even if you have expertise in the field, if you haven't actually seen the code you're talking about, then you can't say for certain how quick or easy making changes to that code would be.</div></div><hr />

There are few problems with that idea:<br />
<br />
1. Throwing more people on project doesn't always mean project will be better.<br />
<br />
2. You assume that resources they are using on Classic would otherwise be used on BfA.<br />
<br />
3. You assume that BfA needs fixing. Developers clearly disagree.<br />
<br />
4. Game is not only about you and what you want. There are millions of other players who left WoW for whatever reason, Classic will bring many of them back.<br />
<br />
Classic development will benefit WoW as whole. It will bring back many players. Some of them might even try your beloved BfA.</div></div><hr />

There will be enough people like me drawn to these dead realms with smaller communities with less crybabies and elitists leaving the group after a wipe or ninjaing whatever loot they can.

They will have a small number of realms for classic total. They will use sharding for the launch to handle the huge influx of players and then gradually stop with the sharding as the populations stabilize.</div></div><hr />

They've already got data on how popular it will be, just depends on how many they can fit, realistically, on each server.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah that's most likely going to be their definitive plan for launch. Are shards going to be used only for the few starting zones though? IDK if they ever went into more details regarding shards since the demo and the short time afterwards they talked about it.</div></div><hr />

We have to remember that vanilla was made by a bunch of amatuers doing their first MMO ever, it was a mess<br />
<br />
Amateurs? Hardly.<br />
<br />
Blizzard had been making video games for over a decade at that point. It's not that they were hacks it's just that technology is constantly evolving. What was great in 2004 is not going to be so great 15 years later.</div></div><hr />

If you think Blizzard is less competent than a bunch of nobodies that emulated private Vanilla servers for tens of thousands of people then.... I agree. They are. Or it's a marketing move - take your pick.<br />
Botched mangos core hacked together with bandaid =/= proper product where you actually have to care about security issues <br />

I should have said &quot;amatuers in mmo's&quot; they had no clue what they were doing with an MMO and didn't even know how it was going to do. WoW was a completely different ball game then anything they had done.<br />

That pretty much describes every project that any software engineer has ever touched. Mistakes are always made in any software project. Ask any software engineer to look at code they wrote 5 years ago. They'll look at it and tell you it's shit.<br />

And people who blindly believe companies make me smile. They only want what's best for you, right?<br />
<br />
Does Blizzard want what's best for their customers?<br />
<br />
Well 99 times out of 100 what is best for their customers coincides with what is profitable. That's how the entertainment industry tends to work. Good stuff does well and is profitable and bad stuff doesn't do well and doesn't make money.<br />
<br />
Diablo Immortal aside, yes Blizzard mostly does what's best for their customers. They're not some agency shrouded in conspiracy. They just make video games.</div></div><hr />

People playing the current game need to just stop with this. Both games can coexist and so what if one ends up doing better than the other? It's better for the game overall long term.<br />

Did Classic have flaws? It sure did. Did some of the QoL mechanisms, implemented over the years, make for a better playing experience without taking away from gameplay? Yes, they did. <br />
<br />
Nostalgia is also a factor. I had a lot of fun in Classic and formed a lot of great game friendships. I probably won't be able to fully replicate that experience, and I know it won't be as fresh and exciting as it once was but the current retail game is an MMO in name only and largely a glorified single player experience.<br />
<br />
But whether or not we agree about which is better, Classic or Retail, Classic once launched will require very little further development. It will, however, for myself and many others, bring us back to the game as a paid subscriber. That's good for WoW regardless of which version you prefer and any rational person would welcome this development and wish us Classic folks the best because as they say the more the merrier.</div></div><hr />

I mean, I despise classic, I think it's the worst version of the game and both TBC and Wrath both improved on it GREATLY. But i'm not going to dog on people for liking it.<br />
<br />
It's a good thing they're doing it, and I hope they also expand it beyond classic. Hell I'd play through to MoP personally.</div></div><hr />

I don't. I hope it remains at Classic forever. Otherwise there's no point in having it as an option. You want expansions, play Retail.<br />
<br />
Leave Classic as the museum Blizzard's already said it is.<br />
<br />
Besides... once you start adding expansions, where do you even stop? TBC? Wrath? Cata? Oh god, Cata… Cata is THE single biggest reason Classic is needed, because it is the expansion where 90% of Classic's content was either removed or repurposed.<br />
<br />
I won't play if there are compulsory expansions, nor will I play if they cave to the two people currently asking for private server style character wipes every two or three years. If I wanted the danger of my characters no longer existing, I'd play a private server. If I wanted expansions, I'd play retail.</div></div><hr />

I mean, you're entitled to your opinion, but they've already stated they've thought about producing more of the expansions onto servers, so those of us who want it are definitely going to show our support.<br />
<br />
You can have your classic, I'd rather have a good version of the game like Wrath. And, if I'm being honest, there's nothing wrong with Cata or MoP either, both were decent expansions in their own right, unfortunately the PS's all suck for them.</div></div><hr />

They have a 2005/6 build - just make it work on newer OS + bug fixes (which they know how to fix by now). Modders do shit like this all the time, not to mention gog.com. I don't believe they needed 18 months of development time to release classic. You could've make a new game in that time with resources Blizzard has. I understand the team is smaller, but still - they HAVE the build and the assets.<br />
<br />
I'm not doubting you are in IT, because as in all professions, there are shit people in IT. (What is an &quot;IT Engineer&quot;, anyways...)<br />
<br />
As an actual Senior Systems Engineer...with dba experience, I can quantifiably say that Classic is actually a HUGE undertaking with how they chose to do it -- which in my professional opinion was the right way. Depending how many people they have on their team, and assuming the team is worth anything, I can see it taking this long to get it right. <br />
<br />
Building a new game from scratch would be 1000x easier.</div></div><hr />

They've also already referred to Classic as a preservation project. You can't preserve Classic if you're tacking expansions on.<br />
<br />
<br />
You can have your classic, I'd rather have a good version of the game like Wrath.<br />
<br />
Classic IS a &quot;good version of the game.&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
And, if I'm being honest, there's nothing wrong with Cata<br />
<br />
Are you serious? Cata single-handedly destroyed the &quot;world&quot; in World of Warcraft by replacing it with a cheap, pop-culture-referencing cash-in on the &quot;ZOMG 2012 is the end of the world!&quot; hype that was going on at the time.<br />
<br />
<br />
or MoP either<br />
<br />
Okay you've got me there. That one was surprisingly decent. I don't want Classic to end up there though -- it'd have to go through Cata first, and I *hate* Cata.</div></div><hr />

You're also using Occam's razor incorrectly. I guess technically you're not since I dunno what in the fuck &quot;Okcham's&quot; razor is.<br />
<br />
&quot;Occam's razor (also Ockham's razor or Ocham's razor (Latin: novacula Occami); further known as the law of parsimony (Latin: lex parsimoniae)) is the problem-solving principle that essentially states that &quot;simpler solutions are more likely to be correct than complex ones.&quot; &quot;<br />
<br />
Well that's your problem, mate. I would expect someone to realize a typo (&quot;Okham&quot; instead of &quot;Ockham&quot;), but I guess you didn't. I don't think there's a point in arguing with you, seeing as your mouth foaming insults represent your intellectual level.</div></div><hr />

I'm completely aware of the things you listed, but it still shouldn't take 18 months for AAA dev team. Stop strawmanning and think for a second. They have all the needed assets, they have the old engine (which is still, even in retail, heavily modified old engine) and most of all - they have experience with their own engine. They could've just make the game again with all the resources they have in 12 months. If you think &quot;patching systems&quot; or &quot;different launcher&quot; is a problem for a software/database engineer to fix in more than a week then I don't think this discussion will go anywhere.<br />
<br />
It's all Okcham's razor - what's more probable:<br />
1) they're taking 18 months to re-release a VERSION of a game they've already made long time ago (now having much more experience). <br />
2) they want to strategically release the game when retail will be suffering a major, annual player drop-off while building the hype for Classic?<br />
<br />
