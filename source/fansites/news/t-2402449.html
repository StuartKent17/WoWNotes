And in addition 15. August is holiday in my country, so I need only 1 day off from work ;D). Of course still I would prefer weekend (if tech is similar to Legion, they should handle it), but I understand why they don't want to risk total overload.<br />
<br />
Now let's hope it will be more than Legion (when I got 110 first day and was able to start Suramar and grab Valarjar emissary before it vanished next day) than WoD (when I said &quot;fuck this broken shit&quot; on 2 am).<br />
<br />
<br />
Poor login servers.<br />
<br />
No one was expecting Blizz to launch BfA at same time on every region. So if they're doing it, it's pretty good sign they are confident with their tech. So far every Legion patch (with notable exception of 7.3.5) and launch were executed perfectly.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That’s not how the time zones work? The whole point of this is to have a simultaneous launch world wide. If US got it At midnight EU would launch at 8AM, which is objectively worse (unless you’ve taken the day off).</div></div><hr />

It's 00:00, because when you count you go 12, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. In America, anyway.</div></div><hr />

It can't really be more smooth than Legion, at least in my case. I got starting quest 10 minutes before launch and literally had 0 problems for next few days (when some idiots DDOS servers).<br />
<br />
<br />
So, they say it is Tuesday the 13th, but that is actually Monday the 13th. Normally launches are on Tuesday (patch day in America) so is it the 13th or the 14th? I want to put it on my calendar!<br />
<br />
Expansion launches have nothing to do with patch days. You'll have all content files first day of prepatch, they'll just flip switch on during launch.</div></div><hr />

12 am is equal to 24, which is equal to 0. There are various time zone converters out there to make it easier to understand. Just use google. It isn't an american time format either. It is a 12 hour vs 24 hour. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12-hour_clock#Use_by_country<br />

The launch is Tuesday the 14th. Some time zones are launching earlier on the 13th because of the way time zones work. No where in the announcement does it say that Tuesday is the 13th.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Typically the only time most people on the internet see it used is by American companies/people, though. And 12 being the first hour of a &quot;segment&quot; of the day makes no sense regardless of who uses the system. Also using 12 hour times for launch times in regions that don't use the 12 hour system is pretty stupid(and UTC is purely 24 hour, so using am/pm in connection with that is even more stupid)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Again though it originated from the British rather then Americans. It isn't an American thing even if it is most commonly seen from American places. It is pretty much just a semantic thing for the day starting at 0 or 12. It is 0 o'clock vs it is 12 o'clock. They certainly could have numbered it differently but it isn't illogical in the slightest. Roman numerals do not have an equivalent for 0. That is likely another reason why 12 was ingrained instead of 0.<br />
<br />
Not to mention even 24 hour time uses 12 for noon. So either way it should still make sense no matter using &quot;American&quot; or &quot;Not American&quot;. 12-hour format is just 24 divide in half.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's how it's always been in EU. It makes it easier to do a simultaneous launch on their end since 12 in the UK is around 7-8 hours ahead. Means they can launch it in their work hours and keep an eye on it for longer in case an issue pops up.<br />
<br />
But why does it matter if people are ahead? Go to sleep. Your health is more important than some game mate. <br />
<br />
Also why does it matter about &quot;NA vs EU&quot;? The raid isn't going to be open straight away and the race to max level is barely relevant these days.</div></div><hr />

Uhm... Legion?<br />
<br />
Wasn't perfect but it was a damn sight better than past expansions.<br />
<br />
There was not a single major problem with Legion that I can recall. Just some minor lagspikes a few days in that were fixed quickly. Sharding was a godsend for that expansion launch.<br />

You will never get a perfect expansion launch from a game with this many players.</div></div><hr />

Legion's launch went without a problem. There were no major problems back then thanks to server sharding. <br />

EDIT: That said, I am in the beta, so nothing exciting to see at midnight, when thinking about it. I will already have seen it, and can sleep tight without being bugged by my own impatience of &quot;opening that present with all the new exciting stuff&quot; before I can sleep...<br />

Ergh, I'm no youngster without a family and a job, anymore.<br />
<br />
Since it's always been released at midnight, I have usually always logged on just to check in, stayed on for an hour then gone to bed(or be dragged to bed around then by my better half... who also plays btw, but who has a more healthy view on launches)<br />
<br />
I dunno, I just love the launch feeling. The first few hours of it. EDIT: Oh wait, I never get more than just the first hour. Doh.</div></div><hr />

They don't have control over it, it's their ISP being hit so take it up with them, not as easy as you think. And it wasn't &quot;shut down&quot; anyway, it was slightly more laggy than usual for a couple of hours until whoever it was got bored.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And most countries use both 24 and 12 hour time formats. My digital watch is a 12 hour format because I've gotten so used to it over the years and because I think 23:59 is silly. <br />
<br />
When you ask someone for the time they don't go &quot;it's 23:59 in the evening&quot;. Because it sounds moronic. <br />
<br />
00:00 is Midnight on a 24 hour clock.<br />

12:00 am is Midnight on a 12 hour clock.<br />

Based on London release time, they mean midnight. <br />

Oh please the DDoS attacks were over fairly quickly and the issues were fixed. <br />
<br />
You really wanna claim it was as bad as other expansions or even WoD? MoP some servers were stuck on the airship for 6 hours because of both lag and not being able to hit the quest mob, WoD we had nearly a week of lag, bugs and god knows what else.<br />
<br />
Cata half the time you could barely log in and even when you did it was a shitstorm.<br />
<br />
Legions launch was very smooth compared to past expansions because we finally got Sharding which created another instance of a zone when it was considered full or congested.<br />
<br />
You should never expect a fully smooth expansion launch for a game with a fuckton of players. Of course there will be issues for the first few days at most. And in Blizzards defence the DDoS is not their fault. No company can fully defend against it. <br />
<br />
Could I see a source however for &quot;several&quot; people not being able to get into their order halls? I don't recall it being an issue.</div></div><hr />

If you manage to count to 24 (bravo, by the way), you should handle two seperate time formats. Or at least don't embarrass yourself and do 1 second google research, if you don't know what 12 AM means.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Blame the Brits:<br />
<br />
&quot;In several countries the 12-hour clock is the dominant written and spoken system of time, predominantly in nations that were part of the former British Empire (the United Kingdom, the United States, Australia, India, Pakistan, Malaysia, Bangladesh etc.), though a few others (Mexico, Egypt, and the former American colony of the Philippines) follow this convention as well.&quot;<br />
<br />
If you've never been in the Military in America you have little to no exposure to the 24 hr clock, so you're more than likely to see just about any post coming out of the US using the 12 hour clock.<br />
<br />
Even as an American though, after serving, I have everything set to the 24 hour clock, it just makes more damn sense.</div></div><hr />

It still wasn't a smooth launch regardless. It was just as bad as WoD for me and many other players who were posting on the forums about it. I agree about never expecting a fully smooth launch, however Blizzard should know that too by this point and they shouldn't be making it worse by doing a worldwide launch when they haven't been able to nail a near perfect launch once in the history of their expansion launches.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No it wasn't as bad as fucking WoD. As someone who spent an extensive amount of time on both Legion launch wasn't smooth but it was astronomically better than WoD. <br />
<br />
Just stop now. WoD had nearly a week of continuous issues on top of the lag. Scenario content bugging because it hadn't been fully tested on Beta like the Nagrand one. Half the time it would either despawn or absolutely fuck up and the NPCs would just stop so you were unable to finish the story in some situations.<br />
<br />
Oh and having some of the servers crash was just the icing on the cake for WoD. We had literally one crash over here in EU and it was Draenor which is a huge Horde server.<br />
<br />
Legion literally had a DDoS and one issue that you claim. I'd like to see the sources of a fair chunk or &quot;several&quot; people as you put it not being able to access their order halls.<br />
<br />
Legion was arguably the smoothest launch we've had for an expansion in years due to the tech advancements such as sharding and CRZ.<br />
<br />
WoD was so bad we got game time dude. Legion really wasn't as bad as you are making out to be or you are just in the minority on this one.</div></div><hr />

You were in the minority then. We reside on a Full server and had ZERO launch issues outside of the minor DDoS 3 days in. WoD was so horribly bad they gave everyone GAME TIME, they haven't done that in years.<br />

Legion literally had a DDoS and one issue that you claim. I'd like to see the sources of a fair chunk or &quot;several&quot; people as you put it not being able to access their order halls.<br />
<br />
I didn't have any of those problems in WoD. At all. You telling me what my experiences are and telling me to &quot;stop&quot; doesn't make you look intelligent by the way. The smoothest launch by far for me was MoP. Only issue I had in MoP was the first quest of getting to Pandaria and a small snag in Dread Wastes.<br />
<br />
As for you wanting proof, all the old forum posts are gone since they transitioned to their new forums. It was a wide spread issue, regardless of if you want to believe it or not, fact is that it happened.</div></div><hr />

So basically you have zero proof?<br />
<br />
Despite you asking in another thread for someone to present theirs and giving them shit when they didn't?<br />
<br />
Oh the hypocrisy....<br />
<br />
Yeah think I'm done here. You've done a great job making yourself look silly here though with your &quot;pretending to be intelligent&quot; remark. Nobody here was doing that.<br />
<br />
Don't make a factual claim if you don't have the proof to back it up.<br />
<br />
Considering they actively put game time on accounts that shows it was a majority issue and severe enough to warrant it. Hell the fucking WoD issues even appeared on BBCs Watchdog it got that bad.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rhorle</div><div class="date">2018-06-07, 06:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Which is a big &quot;if&quot; for an international post that concerns a whole lot of countries that don't use a 12-hour system.<br />
<br />
Also, for people saying &quot;it's logical&quot;: no it isn't. Using 12 instead of 0? Sure, why not. But then it would be at least as logical to not switch am/pm. Days would go from 1am to 12am then from 1pm to 12pm. After 12:59pm, it's 1am. Instead of going from 12 am 1 am and then all the way to 11am.<br />
I'm sure there are reasons for why it is how it is, but things could certainly be different and it's pretty arrogant to assume people not used to 12-hour systems are stupid.<br />
<br />
Because ante meridiem and post meridiem are what AM and PM actually stand for. It isn't post until noon. Since it is a 12 hour system ante is applied at midnight. If you dont' understand the meaning of the abbreviations then it likely doesn't make sense. It is also because the 12 is really signifying 0 or a &quot;reset&quot;. 0 likely wasn't originally used because of Roman Numerals lacking a 0 symbol.<br />
<br />
It isn't like Blizzard hasn't used 12 hour time formats before. Or a person can easily find the 24 hour format with a google search.</div></div><hr />

Look at you with more personal attacks, thumbs up to you for yet again harassing another forum member like you do in 80% of your posts.

Not harassing you. But play the victim card. It's adorable.<br />
<br />
Just telling it how it is. Calling someone out for not presenting factual evidence and then refusing to present your own with a weak statement is what is referred to as hypocrisy.<br />
<br />
Not my fault that's the way it is. If you think that is harassment then sorry to say this but you shouldn't be in an online forum.<br />

<br />
In fact, it's right, you can can't mitigate a ddos attack at the end of the chain. Even if you had enough computationnal capacity on the network level to handle those connections, the network link between you and your ISP will be saturated, whatever the link capacity, a bot network big enough will win.<br />
<br />
So the only way to mitigate those attacks is on ISP level, and more between ISP and L1 ISP. Being able to detect that a big amount of suspected malicious events are coming from a specific zone, and redirecting this traffic into a bgp hole. <br />
<br />
Or, having huge capacity on the ISP level to be able to handle this traffic, and clear the unwanted connection and let only the &quot;normal clients&quot; go through. Those kind of solutions exists, but is tricky to use in a scenario like a wow expac launch, where you'll see coming 10M+ legit client in addition of dos bots. This require to scale even more. But, still possible. <br />
<br />
I think in the case of Blizzard it could be more tricky, because they don't have an uniq access point to their network, but multiple per platforms.</div></div><hr />

The fuck are you talking about? We use 24h timeformat (aka normal and logic timeformat) everywhere except america and little america (UK)...because its just logical and easy to understand. like the metric system, liters and gramms. Even Databases like SQL use 24h format because you can actually work with it. Why should i ever need to know what 12:00 AM or 12:00 PM in real time format means besides the very spare times (actually the first time in my life) i need to convert that?<br />

<br />
To be entirely frank though, WoD's launch was a disaster for other reasons as well. For example, all players being funneled into the same areas and the exact same spots. BfA follows the same method of Legion with allowing players to choose where they want to begin, spreading out &quot;the herd&quot; as well as utilizing sharding. <br />
<br />
If DDoS happens, at least they won't have screwed the pooch by designing in-game bottlenecks such as the Garrison... :D<br />

It is a 24 hour clock split up into 2 12 hour segments. Using a brain to divide or add is apparently to hard.<br />

<br />
There is nothing illogical about a 12 hour clock. It is the same as a 24h clock but divide in two. A 24h clock is the exact same clock as a 12 hour. A 12 hour clock requires less numbers and less surface area for an analog clock. If you can't add or subtract then yes it will be illogical.</div></div><hr />

Be the change you want to see and stop being a hypocrite then? <br />
I don't think you know what &quot;fans&quot; means. <br />
People are passionate about the things they care about. Even though the product is the same, they won't all think the same as you, and they don't care what you think, especially when you without consideration act to swiftly dismis their thoughts and experiences and just insert your own as fact.<br />
There's been issues in the past and a move like this will test the systems for sure. Trolls are going to harass as is their nature and bugs will be found and fixed as per usual.</div></div><hr />

It always amazes me how stupefied people act over a slight change. Putting the month first doesn't change anything. The only problem that arises from it is when reading a date when someone does it different. Putting emphasis on the month then the days is no different then putting emphasis on the days then then the month.<br />
<br />
I write January 3rd 2018. Why not abbreviate it with numerals the same way? Just as it makes sense for someone that commonly writes 3rd of January 2018 to write 3-1-18. It is all how you are introduced and raised but doing it one way is not inherently worse or better. Don't be so close minded.</div></div><hr />

Y-M-D = Highest to lowest<br />
D-M-Y = Lowest to highest<br />
M-D-Y = Middle to lowest to highest....just why? It makes no logical sense to me.<br />
<br />
I understand you are used to it so you understand it best. I just question the base logic of it.<br />
<br />
We also say things like „five after three quarters of four“ for 15:50 in Austria, what makes Germans insane. We would never write it that way Ofc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
D-M-Y isn't exactly lowest to highest though. 31-01-2018 is middle, lowest, highest. 12 months would be lowest, then 31 days, middle, then four digit years. Putting the Month or the Day first is basically semantics. Some people say the 31st of January and some say January 31st. Things kind of evolved from there into what is common. Wikipedia lists some regional parts of countries prefer M-D-Y when they &quot;officially&quot; have a different way.</div></div><hr />
