Wintergrasp Balancing in 4.0.3<br />
In patch 4.0.3, Wintergrasp queuing was changed so that each battle attempts to match the factions at a 1-to-1 ratio. This is the exact system being used for Tol Barad in Cataclysm. While we understand that this inflates queue times for factions which are vastly overpopulated on select realms, we prefer this system over using Tenacity. In addition, the new system at least encourages playing on a faction that's better balanced against the opposing faction. With the old Wintergrasp functionality, players were almost encouraged to be on an overpopulated faction, further contributing to realm balance issues.<br />
<br />
That said, we'll review realms with significant faction imbalances on a case-by-case basis in the event we need to take further action.<br />

Rated Battlegrounds FAQ<br />
The Rated Battlegrounds FAQ has been updated to what seems to be a final version.<br />
World of Warcraft: Cataclysm is just around the corner -- and that means Rated Battlegrounds will soon be available. While Rated Battlegrounds will only be open to level-85 characters, we know many of you may still have some questions about this new system, so we’ve put together an FAQ to help address some of the more common inquiries we've seen.<br />
<br />
Q. What are Rated Battlegrounds?<br />
A. Like the Arena system, Rated Battlegrounds are an alternative way for players to battle against opponents of similar skill levels and accrue rating to purchase powerful PvP gear. Instead of competing in a 2v2, 3v3, or 5v5 bracket, though, you'll be testing your mettle in familiar environments like Arathi Basin and Eye of the Storm, as well as all-new Battlegrounds set to release in Cataclysm.<br />
<br />
Q. How are Rated Battlegrounds structured?<br />
A. Rated Battlegrounds are broken down into two brackets: 10v10 and 15v15. These brackets rotate weekly and can be viewed in-game via the calendar by activating the Battleground holiday filter.<br />
<br />
Q. What Battlegrounds are eligible for Rated Battleground matches?<br />
A. Warsong Gulch, Arathi Basin, Eye of the Storm, Strand of the Ancients, Battle for Gilneas, and Twin Peaks.<br />
<br />
Q. What happened to the 25v25 bracket?<br />
A. We decided to remove this bracket. We don't feel it's feasible to ask players to coordinate a group of 25 players for Rated Battlegrounds. If any player happens to drop group just before a match begins, the raid group would not be able to enter the battle. We anticipate most players or guilds will stick with fairly dedicated 10-player groups, and making the jump to 15-player groups shouldn't be too difficult.<br />
<br />
Q. How can I queue for a Rated Battleground?<br />
A. Before entering the queue, you must first create a raid with the full number of players required for the weekly bracket (10 or 15). Any level-85 player on your realm and of your faction may participate in the battle regardless of guild association.<br />
<br />
Once you have a raid of the appropriate size, simply open up the PvP window, click on the Conquest tab, highlight &quot;Rated Battleground,&quot; and then click &quot;Join Battle.&quot;<br />
<br />
Q. Can I queue up solo and just be matched with a Rated Battleground team?<br />
A. No. You will need to first join a raid of the appropriate size and level before you can queue up for a Rated Battleground. Individual queuing will not be available for Rated Battlegrounds.<br />
<br />
Q. Do all players in the raid group have to be from the same guild in order to queue for a Rated Battleground?<br />
A. No. So long as the raid group size matches the weekly bracket and is comprised of level-85 players, you can queue up for a Rated Battleground no matter what guild you are in. Guild membership has no effect on the formation of Battleground teams.<br />
<br />
Winning a Rated Battleground with a team composed of at least 80% guild members, however, will result in the additional benefit of guild experience gain for that guild.<br />
<br />
Q. How can I tell if my Rated Battleground team meets the minimum guild requirement?<br />
A. If you join a Rated Battleground with the minimum number of required guild members, a special guild banner will appear in the upper-left corner of the in-game mini-map. This will let you know if you are eligible for the bonus guild experience.<br />
<br />
Q. What are the normal benefits of winning a Rated Battleground?<br />
A. When you win a Rated Battleground, you will be rewarded Conquest points, up to your weekly cap. Weekly caps are individual for each player and are based on your highest single PvP rating from the previous week (the cap resets on Tuesdays). This rating can be derived from your 2v2, 3v3, or 5v5 Arena rating or your Rated Battleground rating.<br />
<br />
Q. What Rated Battleground rating do players start out with?<br />
A. Players start at zero Rated Battleground rating and progress upward from there. If you lose a battle, your Rated Battleground rating will only be reduced if that rating is currently higher than your Match Making Value (MMV). For the most part, a rating only goes up.<br />
<br />
Q. What’s MMV?<br />
A. Match Making Value (or MMV for short) is our best measure of an individual player's skill. MMV is the skill rating per format (2v2, 3v3, 5v5, Battleground) and per character that is used for matchmaking. It exists to help the matchmaking system create great matches as quickly as possible for all players. It's generally not a rating we show, with the exception of an average MMV for Arena teams.<br />
<br />
Q. Will my MMV go down in the event of a Rated Battleground loss?<br />
A. Yes; however, unlike Arenas, all players in a Rated Battleground team will win or lose the same amount of Rated Battleground rating per match depending on its outcome.<br />
<br />
Q. Does MMV for Rated Battlegrounds function the same as it does in Arenas (i.e. does it go up more when you beat a higher-rated team, and go down more when you lose to a lower-rated team)?<br />
A. Yes. Your MMV will go up faster if you defeat a Rated Battleground team with a higher average MMV.<br />
<br />
Q. What’s the plan to prevent your Rated Battleground rating from skyrocketing at high win ratios? If your rating only goes down when it is above your MMV, it seems that ratings will just be high on average (compared to Arena).<br />
A. If your Rated Battleground rating gets inflated much beyond your MMV, you’ll only receive a minimal amount of points when you win. Similarly, you’ll lose many more points after a defeat, until your Rated Battleground rating gets back in line with your MMV. This will prevent inflation.<br />
<br />
Q. Can consumables and engineering items be used in Rated Battlegrounds?<br />
A.Yes, but they will follow the same rules and restrictions as Arenas.<br />
<br />
Q. Will Rated Battleground teams only be matched against other teams in their Battlegroup?<br />
A. No. Rated Battlegrounds will be region-wide, meaning that when you queue for a Rated Battleground, you will have the opportunity to be matched against a team from any of our North American World of Warcraft realms.<br />
<br />
[b]World of Warcraft: Cataclysm is just around the corner -- and that means Rated Battlegrounds will soon be available.

<br />
Q. Are there any plans to reward players with the highest Rated Battleground rating, similar to Arenas?<br />
A. Epic ground mounts will be rewarded at the end of each season to the top 0.5% of players according to Rated Battleground rating. Titles are also available as you gain rating in the system. The titles are rewarded directly from achievements earned from gaining the required rating.<br />

And that's exactly why this change was needed. At the moment everyone flocks to one side so they always win WG, causing severe server imbalance. Now the need for imbalance is removed, balance will return and WG will be fine again.<br />
<br />
I'm sure Blizzard will offer free transfers or faction changes for realms with balance issues. Before no one took these offers, because they wanted to be on the winning team. Hopefully now they will understand balance is better and do take the offer.<br />
<br />
You only have the community to thank for this change. If they hadn't created the imbalance just to win some stupid PvP event, this would not be needed.</div></div><hr />

This change may be good on some servers but all servers that are low populated are screwed. On my server there is 3 horde players that can join every time wintergrasp is up and sadly they are not even able to win it so we just dont get wintergrasp at all anymore. Not that at this point wintergrasp is important or anything but it will be just as bad for tol barad. Sure tenacity was lame if you got killed by someone with 20 stacks of it but at least you could get into the battle, do your quest, get some honor and win so you can do VoA. <br />
There should at least be a minimum amount of players that can always join, like they first announced. I don't know if this change will help fix the imbalance on high or normal populated realms but it sure wont do any good on low pop servers because if players can't even do wintergrasp or tol barad in cata they will just transfer away.</div></div><hr />

- 5v5 wintergrasp over whole day because alliance is lazy on my realm (they always played with 15+ tenacity) || sometimes never receiving invite ... In that case its almost impossible to take base with few players to kill and few that helps. I'm punished because somebody else is lazy?<br />
- ok... 1:1 ratio balancing system in wg ... then implement same into battlegrounds. Just lost 3 last IoCs because 40 alliance vs 30 hordes<br />
<br />
This is what I call - finding problems there where they are none. Wintergrasp is world PvP. You can make it instance right now, because after 4.0.3 it lost the last signs of world PvP zone.</div></div><hr />

This is what I call - finding problems there where they are none. Wintergrasp is world PvP. You can make it instance right now, because after 4.0.3 it lost the last signs of world PvP zone.<br />
<br />
<br />
Its sad isn't it. that they make this happen for world pvp zones (or what are supposed to be) but not make it happen in bgs as well. I mean you get really long queues sometimes 20 to 30 minutes and then you just lose anyways because the other side has more players. <br />
World pvp was never about balance. There was no balance when alliance and horde were fighting in hilsbrad over southshore and tm and still it was fun. What blizzard is doing now with those changes is turning those zones into a simple battleground like they used to be before crossrealm bgs were released.<br />
I haven't been able to get into Wintergrasp at all since the patch and I haven't seen more than 3 players in there since then either :(</div></div><hr />

At the moment everyone flocks to one side so they always win WG, causing severe server imbalance. Now the need for imbalance is removed, balance will return and WG will be fine again.<br />
<br />
I'm sure Blizzard will offer free transfers or faction changes for realms with balance issues. Before no one took these offers, because they wanted to be on the winning team. Hopefully now they will understand balance is better and do take the offer.<br />
<br />
You only have the community to thank for this change. If they hadn't created the imbalance just to win some stupid PvP event, this would not be needed.<br />
<br />
I don't think it will work out.. It's not only about winning WG. If several guilds will re roll to alliance, they will find themselves pawned, since there's always a lot of rogues and druids hunting humans in SW, Ironforge, Darnasus.. Basically only very large alliance player base would change situation, but our server is high populated and it would require a hell lot of people. Otherwise they won't be able to play, dominated in own cities. There are people who enjoys it and they are playing alliance, but ask yourself if you would love to go trade in AH with raid, so you would have firepower to cover?<br />
<br />
It may help realms with 1:2 or even 1:4 ratio, but as for realms with total domination it means we will never be able to play WG.<br />
<br />
<br />
P.S.: Maybe it's even right to make world pvp not eligible for us since we won the war against alliance in our realm. However it would be logical then to destroy theyr cities or at least occupy 'em. Goblins would find a use for Ironforge :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sulika</div><div class="date">2010-11-18, 01:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The only way to achieve population balance on realms is if there is a disadvantage to being on the side with the higher population. The way wintergrasp used to work was totally backwards, if you were on the high population side you always won wintergrasp, meaning you got 5% more damage, 5% more xp, free honor while farming your heroics in the form of stone keeper shards and access to an extra raid instance. With all those advantages for being on the faction that had the population advantage on your server huge amounts of people took faction transfers.<br />
<br />
The saddest thing about this change is that it comes way too late. Many realms (my own included, Bloodfeather-EU) which had pretty close populations at the start of WotLK (mine was about 55-45 horde alliance) have been destroyed by people on the low pop side faction transferring, now the realm is more like 90-10 on population. Once the shift starts at all it gathers momentum, you get other disadvantages, with low population nothing sells on AH, it is very hard for guilds to recruit, it's impossible to find arena partners etc. etc. etc.<br />
<br />
Once people find they can't get into Tol Barad on population imbalanced realms they will start to faction transfer back to the low population side. This is a nescessary thing. Wintergrasp has had a profoundly negative effect on realms with many realms gone to having ridiculous imbalance because blizz got the rewards wrong. You have to reward the underdog, that way people want to be the underdog and the realms auto adjust on population such that there is no longer any advantage to either side. This is a good thing.<br />
<br />
And yes, if you were the underdog it is kinda sweet to go to the forums and see the same (in my case) horde who were crying &quot;alliance sucks&quot; because you couldn't win wintergrasp when you were playing with a 20-1 ratio of players now crying because their own faction can't win wintergrasp. If you can't win with equal numbers on both sides it is because you are bad. Luckily this system also balances that and a lot of the bads will faction transfer because they think they alone are skilled and their faction sucks. Either way, balance will eventually win out. It is a fantastic change and one that should have been made years ago.</div></div><hr />

Transfer is not a solution. WG is dead for now on many realms - you can have 10k horde vs 10k alli realm, but there is no guarantee that same amount of players want to play WG.<br />
Solution can be - making it instance and add it to cross-realm battlegroups, so more players can queue from both sides.<br />

Only with a Cata account, and only after launch day. <br />
<br />
With regards to WG, this should have been balanced from the start. WG was clearly broken on almost all realms, to the extent that you'd have 10 alliance vs 100 horde or something, even on a &quot;balanced&quot; realm, since alliance just wouldn't show up since they'd always have 11 stacks of tenacity and be ganked at the graveyard. So next match there'd be even fewer, and fewer after that, and so forth. <br />
<br />
And so, after an entire year or more, only 1 player from the losing side turns up, even during peak hours, since everyone else *knows* that there's no point bothering. This fix was needed, the sides needed to be balanced to stop graveyard ganking, it's as simple as that.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sulika</div><div class="date">2010-11-18, 02:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Im tired of the people claiming the WG change is good. they are ONLY ever from those factions that for the most part dont care about WG. when 99.9% of your pvpers on a server CANT do WG, its worse than losing. at least with the old system, you could at least get honor. now? we have a less than 1% chance of ever seeing a WG battle ever again.

Its happened most of the times so far. How is that &quot;fair and balanced?&quot;<br />
<br />
It is still as &quot;fair and balanced&quot; as it was, or to be precise it is as unfair and unbalanced as it ever was, just now the imbalance favours the other side. The important thing is that now the faction transfer trend will be one that fixes the problem as opposed to one that exacerbates it. I have gone three weeks at a time without doing VoA because it was never alliance controlled between 5pm and 1am. <br />
<br />
On my own server, Bloodfeather-EU the book in VoA reveals the following:<br />
<br />
Alliance: Keep Defended 265 times.<br />
Horde: Keep Defended 2555 times.<br />
<br />
A year ago the difference was less than 100 times. Thats an extra 7000 hours+ or about 300 days of game time where horde had access to VoA, where horde got free honor via stone keepers shards, where horde had 5% increased damage and xp gained. An extra 2300 times that every horde on the server who cared to join got the extra 1.5k or so more honor you get for winning as opposed to losing. It was a ridiculous and broken system and worse it was a system that was designed in such a way as to exacerbate the problem. It encouraged people to do exactly the worst thing, transfer to the high population faction.<br />
<br />
So now, I don't think anyone is arguing it is fun to be unable to get into wintergrasp (and if you think people are crying now, wait until they can't get into Tol Barad at lvl 85) but at least now what will happen is that the people who are unhappy will change to the underpopulated faction. This is what the servers need to encourage healthy population balance. It is a good change.</div></div><hr />

And you care because? People will have the same things as you? Now, that might make it &quot;less epic&quot; for you but for someone else it might be &quot;super epic&quot;.

I understand limiting due to technical problems - server lags, disconnecting player on slow lines because of high amount of data to transfer with 200 characters fighting on one place ... but this 1:1 ratio is #$%^&amp; - it's just punishing players that want to play world PvP... Hope it will be fixed/removed ASAP</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lunaspike</div><div class="date">2010-11-18, 04:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The only way to achieve population balance on realms is if there is a disadvantage to being on the side with the higher population. The way wintergrasp used to work was totally backwards, if you were on the high population side you always won wintergrasp, meaning you got 5% more damage, 5% more xp, free honor while farming your heroics in the form of stone keeper shards and access to an extra raid instance. With all those advantages for being on the faction that had the population advantage on your server huge amounts of people took faction transfers.<br />
<br />
The saddest thing about this change is that it comes way too late. Many realms (my own included, Bloodfeather-EU) which had pretty close populations at the start of WotLK (mine was about 55-45 horde alliance) have been destroyed by people on the low pop side faction transferring, now the realm is more like 90-10 on population. Once the shift starts at all it gathers momentum, you get other disadvantages, with low population nothing sells on AH, it is very hard for guilds to recruit, it's impossible to find arena partners etc. etc. etc.<br />
<br />
Once people find they can't get into Tol Barad on population imbalanced realms they will start to faction transfer back to the low population side. This is a nescessary thing. Wintergrasp has had a profoundly negative effect on realms with many realms gone to having ridiculous imbalance because blizz got the rewards wrong. You have to reward the underdog, that way people want to be the underdog and the realms auto adjust on population such that there is no longer any advantage to either side. This is a good thing.<br />
<br />
And yes, if you were the underdog it is kinda sweet to go to the forums and see the same (in my case) horde who were crying &quot;alliance sucks&quot; because you couldn't win wintergrasp when you were playing with a 20-1 ratio of players now crying because their own faction can't win wintergrasp. If you can't win with equal numbers on both sides it is because you are bad. Luckily this system also balances that and a lot of the bads will faction transfer because they think they alone are skilled and their faction sucks. Either way, balance will eventually win out. It is a fantastic change and one that should have been made years ago.<br />
<br />
I completely agree with you. On bloodhoof it wasn't so bad when I started. With wg though it became common practice to switch to the alliance to gear up. More and more started doing it, and now the faction population has gone out of control. We almost never had a game (yes even at 3 am) without at least 5 stacks of tenacity. It made no sense to me how the horde can so easily dominate battle grounds, but can never hold wintergrasp. Getting farmed at our respawn because the alliance had us so outnumbered. You can say tenacity worked, but not when there are 3 of you to 20 of them. Sure you are a raid boss, except you can be cced. They poly one of you, fear the other and focus fire the third. He's down and now you go down, then the other guy. Repeat until you all hearth out of wintergrasp, or you stand on your graveyard waiting for it to end. Except they won't destroy the last tower just so they can torture you. Yeah, that was really fun. Now things are different, and I love payback. Hell those people in wintergrasp are probably a huge reason I am so brutal in battlegrounds. Think graveyard camping, while one member holds the flag in warsong. You just sit there and kill them as they respawn and your guy doesn't cap. It's mean, I might have felt bad about it if I hadn't just spent 20 minutes getting farmed myself. <br />
<br />
To the people saying world pvp is dead, you are wrong. Wintergrasp is still a pvp zone, the only part that is limited is the actual battle control of the fortress. Wintergrasp is still the best zone for farming ore, herbs, and eternals. Just go there and look, you will find plenty of opportunities for world pvp. <br />
<br />
Honestly what I am seeing is a bunch of QQ from people who don't like that the other side stands a chance now. My advice, get better. Sure you might enjoy outnumbering one side by 10 to 1, but that isn't very fun for them. Now that things will be on equal ground it will be more fun. People that didn't do wg anymore because they were tired of always being outnumbered will play it again. This will allow the larger factions to queue in more also. This is a very good change, and one that should have been in place from day 1. Think of all of the positives.<br />
<br />
It gets people that quit going back, because now they aren't so outnumbered<br />
It addresses the faction population problems by encouraging people to switch to the low pop side<br />
It will force people to get better at pvp because they can't rely on outnumbering the other side<br />
It makes money for blizz because of faction changes<br />
It will help populate low pop servers because people will take a free transfer to another server to be able to queue for wg, or tb. <br />
<br />
I honestly don't see any downside at all.</div></div><hr />

Archeology is not depended on expansion I think as inscription isn't (I don't have WotLK, but can still train it).<br />
<br />
A part from that I wonder what else will come with the patch. Will the new classes be unlocked for exisiting races for example? I mean it's only logical that the new class combos can't be expansion needed as that would shut out new players from the experience, but it's possible they will be locked until cata release.</div></div><hr />

A. Yes; however, unlike Arenas, all players in a Rated Battleground team will win or lose the same amount of Rated Battleground rating per match depending on its outcome.&quot;<br />
<br />
What? That makes no sense and is the opposite of what they have said in the past. Is this a typo?<br />
<br />
All players in an Arena match win/lose the same amount of points per game. Blizz said that UNlike arenas, all players in a Rated BG will win/lose the same amount of points per game.<br />
<br />
Before Beta Blizz told us that you wouldn't be penalized for having bad players on your team as long as you carried. In other words, they said that all players in a Rated BG will NOT lose the same amount of points per loss.<br />

If they had done this and all-North America BG q's from the start, the realm imbalances would have been much less attractive and probably wouldn't be nearly as bad as they are now. Their next action should be to open some faction specific free realm transfers to help restore some of the balance they lost by dicking around for over a year.</div></div><hr />

The Shattering will have almost no impact on Pilgrim's Bounty. The only thing that would remotely be affected is something like Turkey Lurkey which would be slightly more difficult without having a Sanctuary city that people hang out in. Now Hallow's End would have been another story as some of the Candy Buckets that you need to visit are in towns that no longer exist. But Pilgrim's Bounty has feast tables setup outside the major cities and those areas are not going away or changing significantly for there to be any impact.</div></div><hr />

WG is dead for now on many realms - you can have 10k horde vs 10k alli realm, but there is no guarantee that same amount of players want to play WG.<br />
Solution can be - making it instance and add it to cross-realm battlegroups, so more players can queue from both sides.<br />
<br />
I have written ticket to GM, his/her respond was like - we know about this problem, development team is working on it. Default, but at least they know about it.<br />
<br />
<br />
The only reason you see lower involvement in WG now is that there is no compelling reason to do it vs. just another BG. When Tol'Barad offers a shot at an instance with loot that matters like VoA used to do + bonuses while leveling and gearing for 85, there will be much more q-ing on both sides.</div></div><hr />

<br />
implementation 1:1 ratio in patch 3.1 will be good idea, but now ... after tol'barad, no alliance will queue wintergrasp (now they are 5), so wintergrasp will be closed zone for 30 minutes. My only opinion is - let the pvp zone free without limits. Give them 50 stacks of tenacity, but don't apply any restrictions for 1:1 ... there is no reason for doing this. Especially because some realms are really unbalanced and players could have problems enjoying the new content</div></div><hr />
