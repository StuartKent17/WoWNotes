Login Queue Clarification on Medium Population Realms<br />
Why does Herod still have a 900 person, 8 minute queue when it’s showing Medium population?<br />
The way realm population display currently works once the servers are live is that High, Medium, and Low are determined dynamically, in terms relative to the most crowded realms. So a realm with pretty rough queues (say 4k-5k) might end up showing as Medium because you aren’t Faerlina, Herod, etc.<br />
This is how it’s worked for a long time, but the unprecedented size of the queues on the handful of outlier realms is skewing the algorithm. The team’s first priority is stability and getting new servers online as needed, but beyond that, we’ll look into changing this logic to be more intuitive (i.e. showing “Full” when a server has a queue, for starters). I know, this is technically not #nochanges, but then again neither are 20k people waiting to log into the same realm... (Blue Tracker (https://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/1107728-medium-pop-still-has-login-queue/) / Official Forums (https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/271551/10))<br />
<br />
You MUST have known there would be long queues. Why the hesitation to have servers in place to handle extra players? (not characters)<br />
I  understand the frustration: Anticipating and planning around jumping back into this world we’ve all missed, only to be stuck in a long queue, is not the experience we want anyone to have.<br />
<br />
But from the start of planning for this launch, we’ve tried to prioritize the long-term health of our realm communities, recognizing that if we undershot the mark in terms of launch servers, we could move quickly to add additional realms in the opening hours. But if we went out with too many servers, weeks or months down the line we’d have a much tougher problem to solve. While we have tools like free character transfers available as a long-term solution to underpopulated realms, everything about that process would be tremendously disruptive to realm communities, and so it’s something we want to avoid as much as possible.<br />
<br />
Thus, we took the path of launching with few enough realms to still thrive in the event that our most conservative estimates ended up proving accurate, while having enough servers ready to activate at a moment’s notice if needed. And clearly they were, and are, needed.<br />
We’ve released over 20 new realms worldwide so far since launch, and we’ll be up around the clock continuing to do so until everyone who wants to experience Classic is able to. But even still, as we bring new realms online in a given region, we wait for them to fill before opening new ones, because we want to make sure that each and every realm has a healthy population in the long term.

Where are the Zeppelins/Boats?<br />
Are they not working or something? I have a bunch of people asking in general chat, but they’re just not showing up? Are they timegated or bugged?<br />
There is a known issue that’s causing zeppelins and boats to be unavailable on certain servers (mainly the ones brought online after initial launch), which is obviously a major concern if you’re looking to switch starting areas to meet up with friends, or are getting to higher levels and have quests sending you across the sea. The upcoming regionwide restarts (4.5 hours from this post for NA/OCE) will fix this going forward.

Classic Forum Changes Incoming<br />
With the release of WoW Classic mere hours away, I wanted to provide a few updates on what will happen with the Classic sections on the forums:<br />
<br />
<br />
Individual Classic Realm forums will be opened prior to launch.<br />
Starting from 27th August, all WoW Classic sections will require an active subscription or game time to post in.<br />
<br />
The current Classic Discussion section will also be archived tomorrow and a new one created so we start from a clean slate.<br />
<br />
For now, we will not be adding Class or Profession sections for Classic. We encourage you to use the existing sections and prefix your thread title with [Classic]. We will monitor these sections over the coming weeks.<br />
<br />
<br />
Not long to go now!</div></div><hr />

Sure, some people got organized and came over in droves to particular servers, but most of the people who decided to roll on a full server are pretty free to change over, and a lot of them will. Combine that with the thinning of the ranks generally as tourists get their fill of the game and it shouldn't be THAT bad after the first week or so.</div></div><hr />

WTF? What's so bad about free transfers in the future? Transfers are happening 100% anyway<br />

They literally told you to play on other servers to avoid queues, told you they didn't want a lot of servers at launch for the sake of long term health, and opened even more realms. It's your own laziness or stupidity for being in queues for hours. But luckily for you Vanilla experience seekers, that's a big part of vanilla WoW.</div></div><hr />

From what i can see it's also people who reserved a name, and don't want to lose it.</div></div><hr />

They should simply leave transfers FFA for the first month.<br />

<br />
So your suggestion was just have all the servers locked and nobody else is allowed to play classic? They were all queued on release day. Lmao</div></div><hr />
