<br />
Or you could actually take a look at logs, that's what they're for. I am not a DK player myself, but it's not hard to find out that even good players compared to other good players are struggling.</div></div><hr />

For your information, Demon's Bite hits like a wet noodle and is not used in our ST build (= Demon Blades talent). As for the mastery change, we do not know yet whether it is 7% to its current value or a flat 7%. Anyhow, Mastery is our worst stat with t20.</div></div><hr />

elemental shaman single target confirmed fine, i expect top guilds to be taking ZERO ele shamans for later fights where there is no AoE.<br />

<br />
You must have your own logs or something...<br />
1st Boss (Pure ST): 75th P = 11th, 90th P = 13th, Max P = 18th<br />
2nd Boss (2-3 target with padding potential) - ignored<br />
3rd Boss (ST with intermittant AOE): 75th P = 4th, 90th P = 4th, Max P = 5th<br />
4th Boss (AoE zerg) = ignored<br />
5th Boss (3x ST in sequence): 75th P = 10th, 90th P = 10th, Max P = 10th<br />
6th Boss (AOE zergfest with padding potential) = ignored<br />
7th Boss (Pure ST): 75th P = 8th, 90th P = 12th, Max P = 9th<br />
8th Boss (sustained 2 target, then ST): 75th P = 2nd, 90th P = 2nd, Max P = 3rd<br />
Final Boss (ST with some adds): 75th P = 6th, 90th P = 6th, Max P = 12th<br />
<br />
So: No, aff is not really at the top of the rankings 75th to 100th percentile for ST bosses. <br />
<br />
This nerf is probably really more of a &quot;calm-the-community&quot; thing for those that lack brain cells for analytical thinking, but in the big picture won't change much.</div></div><hr />

You're an idiot and you should feel like one. Go gather facts before spouting your BS and check Warcraft Logs. DHs are nowhere near the top charts. They're one of the lower performing specs...</div></div><hr />

1 - you're obviously casual as fuck so why would you even care?<br />
2 - DH is dog shit dmg atm, worst it has been all x-pac, currently 3rd sport from bottom<br />
3 - most important the 'buff' was actually a nerf, and most DH are fuckin pissed<br />
<br />
enjoy you unsub, dont come back :)</div></div><hr />

Oh look, someone who has absolutely no idea what they are talking about. Affliction is decidedly middle of the pack for Single Target, and it will only be worse today. Also, enjoy your forum ban.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Do you have any idea how to check on actual statistics rather than your own personal preference? If you look at the actual data gathered from ToS from warcraftlogs Havoc DH are actually doing the 3rd WORST damage of all dps specs only ahead of Sruvival Hunter and WW Monk.<br />
<br />
I suggest next time you do your due diligence and do a little research before spouting off :)</div></div><hr />
