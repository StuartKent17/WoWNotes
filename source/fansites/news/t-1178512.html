As with any new expansion, we often find that we have an opportunity to take a closer look at a variety of game systems within World of Warcraft and explore new ideas or improvements to the game. One system in particular is held near and dear to the hearts of the community: professions. With Mists of Pandaria, the designers were able to seize upon an opportunity to look at the role of materials and refine their purpose and their usefulness. In the end, they came up with Spirit of Harmony as the new resource du jour.<br />
<br />
Harmonious Prospects<br />
In Mists of Pandaria, we’re introducing a new material known as the Spirit of Harmony. It slices— it dices— well, ok, it doesn’t, but crafters of any stripe will find it has many uses. By now, any experienced crafter is used to filling bags with a variety of materials such as Primal Life, Primal Fire, Primal Earth, etc. but in Mists of Pandaria, it’s all about Spirit of Harmony (in combination with the usual materials, like ore, leather, and gems). Spirit of Harmony is the result of the designers simplifying an already complex system while still keeping a wide variety of possibilities open to players. Much like with other Primals, Mote of Harmony (http://www.wowdb.com/items/89112) can be combined (10 to 1) to create one Spirit of Harmony (http://www.wowdb.com/items/76061).<br />
<br />
Harmony is Personal<br />
Let’s get right to it. Spirit of Harmony is a Bind on Pickup (or “BoP” to veterans) crafting material that can be found on every lootable creature in every zone in Pandaria -- from dungeons to the outdoor world. Intially, we want crafters to be out in the world adventuring instead of camping out in front of an auctioneer, hoping to score some cheap mats.<br />
<br />
We understand that this may be of concern to those who play a variety of profession alts, and may consider other options for the future, including the possibility of allowing Spirits of Harmony to be Bind to Account in a future patch.<br />
<br />
In addition to serving as a core crafting ingredient, Spirit of Harmony (http://www.wowdb.com/items/76061) can also be used to purchase a variety of additional bonuses or materials that your character may need. While not every profession will get equal value out of them, most everyone will need to collect them for one reason or another.<br />
Here are some examples of the many ways that Spirit of Harmony can be used:<br />
<br />
Alchemy: Purchase an extra Transmute (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/130326-riddle-of-steel).<br />
Archaeology: Purchase a restored artifact (http://www.wowdb.com/items/87399-restored-artifact#related:sold-by).<br />
Cooking: Exchange for an Ironpaw Token.<br />
Enchanting: Buy reagents (http://www.wowdb.com/items/76061-spirit-of-harmony#related:currency-for).<br />
Engineering: New mounts and personal goggles.<br />
Herbalism: Purchase herbs (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/66685-danky-kim).<br />
Inscription: Purchase rare inks (http://www.wowdb.com/items/79255-starlight-ink).<br />
Jewelcrafting: Use to purchase extra daily discoveries (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/131759-secrets-of-the-stone).<br />
Tailoring (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/professions/tailoring?filter-first-seen-in-mop=y&amp;filter-search=), Blacksmithing (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/professions/blacksmithing?filter-first-seen-in-mop=y&amp;filter-search=), Leatherworking (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/professions/Leatherworking?filter-first-seen-in-mop=y&amp;filter-search=): Used to create epic items.<br />
<br />
Purchasing materials may not ultimately be the most efficient way to gain resources, but it can be an added convenience to purchase something with Spirit of Harmony rather than going back into the world to get it. The Spirit of Harmony vendor (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/66685-danky-kim) can be found in the Vale of Eternal Blossoms.</div></div><hr />

I think this overly punishes crafting alts though, a better solution would be to make them BoA - then, you won't be able to sell them on the AH, but you can still send motes and spirits to the alt that will benefit the most (not the one you do dailies on the most often).</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I don't get why they don't make it BoA from the get go...<br />
<br />
thats because they want you to level all your characters first. and sometime around 5.3 this thing becomes BoE as usual.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I hadn't thought of this, but there are many other things that they can still exploit. This being one less is a good thing though.<br />
<br />
<br />
So Jewelcrafters now have to &quot;discover&quot; their cuts? I hadn't heard that before. Normally the other JCer in my guild collects half the recipes and I collect the other half to have a nice variety available to our raiders faster. I guess that's not gonna be happening any more... :(<br />
<br />
Imho discoveries are a lot more fun than having to grind dailies for a profession. It depends on how they are implemented of course.</div></div><hr />

BoP means that botters can't sell them though, i'd prefer BoA though, that prevents the &quot;Everything off AH&quot;-problem, gets people out into the world, and doesn't punish profession alts as much.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This 'harmony' is the complete opposite of the wording, imagine you have a guild crafter and collects all the patterns, and now that person has the responsibility to spend twice more time just to collect these so called mats to craft for guildies, and since he's crafting for guildies, he wont be charging gold, so ye, this system made so much sense.<br />
<br />
This is just the same as primal nether back in TBC, but primal nether has a purpose, and can be obtained through a team/guild effort, which is great for the game and the players because it helps create bonds. Harmony is simply asking you to endlessly grind mobs on your own, and I wonder how harmony is going to be distributed in LFG, because if people are rolling on a mote instead of allowing everyone to loot 1 when 1 is found on a corpse, it'll be so darn painful.<br />
<br />
It's really a joke that Blizzard &quot;WOULD CONSIDER&quot; making it BoA in the future... it's obvious it should be BoA to begin with, what a brainless team of devs, they stated that they want to make this game positive for people who doesn't have much time and yet they create this garbage new system which requires endless grinding JUST TO CRAFT A PIECE OF RUBBISH(becoz we all know more than half of the craftables have terrible stats that nobody wants).</div></div><hr />

the bots will just trade in these 'boa' things in for tradable things. all this thing really does is decrease value of all raw materials even worse than they already are</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't feel it really will. They'll just add in a few extra bots for other mats and these, and then craft the gear rather than selling the raw mats. I wouldn't be at all surprised to find the AH flooded with fairly cheap gear within a week or two of MoP going live.</div></div><hr />

Primal Nethers were BoP for the longest of times as well. I thought people wanted the game to be more like TBC? Well, here you are. :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
not really.<br />
<br />
first of all chaos orbs dropped in dungeons only, the new motes drop everywhere and I assume the drop rates are the same as in dungeons. either way, motes can be solod from the beginning, chaos orbs couldnt.<br />
<br />
the problem with chaos orbs in the beginning was that everyone could roll on them, no matter if you needed them or if you could even use them.<br />
<br />
You had a guarateed drop when you finished the dungeon. if you ran 3 dungeons and asked guildies to help you to get the orbs then you would get thse orbs, completely discards the probability. with motes you can get very unlucky and thats usually the case when you needed them the most :)<br />
<br />
I do agree though that its going to be a bitch to farm those, and having multiple professions spread across your alts and wanting to max out each and everyone of them is gonna take time. but it depends on how hard the motes affect finishing a profession up to 600...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yep, this will never affect bots, because bots will keep farming and farming faster than any players, and since crafters need to farm their own mats, they will need to up the price for craftables, even if they have poor stats, which makes it even harder for new players or poor players. Guess what, bots will now earn even more gold because of the inflated price on craftables and people reluctant to go out there and farm not just herbs/leather/ores, now you gotten farm the worst of all you could imagine done manually - &quot;FARMONY&quot;</div></div><hr />

Ore is everywhere in MoP (http://www.wowdb.com/objects/209311-ghost-iron-deposit) and farming it is much, much faster than trying to farm these.</div></div><hr />

There is nothing &quot;enhancing&quot; about this at all. It completely knee caps those of us who have put together a network of alts to manage all of our professions. I'm not really in the mood to be out farming on six different toons. <br />

<br />
This 'harmony' is the complete opposite of the wording, imagine you have a guild crafter and collects all the patterns, and now that person has the responsibility to spend twice more time just to collect these so called mats to craft for guildies, and since he's crafting for guildies, he wont be charging gold, so ye, this system made so much sense.<br />
<br />
This is just the same as primal nether back in TBC, but primal nether has a purpose, and can be obtained through a team/guild effort, which is great for the game and the players because it helps create bonds. Harmony is simply asking you to endlessly grind mobs on your own, and I wonder how harmony is going to be distributed in LFG, because if people are rolling on a mote instead of allowing everyone to loot 1 when 1 is found on a corpse, it'll be so darn painful.<br />
<br />
It's really a joke that Blizzard &quot;WOULD CONSIDER&quot; making it BoA in the future... it's obvious it should be BoA to begin with, what a brainless team of devs, they stated that they want to make this game positive for people who doesn't have much time and yet they create this garbage new system which requires endless grinding JUST TO CRAFT A PIECE OF RUBBISH(becoz we all know more than half of the craftables have terrible stats that nobody wants).<br />
<br />
<br />
you have to learn to rlx. as a tailor i have learned that it all depends on the drop rate. if the drop rate is complete shit than yea this sucks but if the drop rate is decent (and it sounds like it would be by being on everything) these items will be plentiful</div></div><hr />

You don't have to grind mobs per se (unless you want 50 of those straight away, of course). Just doing the dailies and running dungeons nets you enough motes.</div></div><hr />

Not even close. I spent an hour farming and I got 12 motes. I need 5 spirits just for a staff. If you want an extra JC research, its 10. Its a bit ridiculous atm with the low drop rate.</div></div><hr />

AFAIK, you don't need those to max your professions (I can't speak for all of them, but for most of them anyway - except maybe BS). Besides, levelling alone should net you some of those (because, well, you have to kill mobs for that).<br />
<br />
I don't really understand why you refer to dungeons as crap though. :confused:</div></div><hr />

It's strange, because I get 5 motes just by doing the Tillers/Halfhill dailies by killing the minimum amount of mobs.<br />
Not to mention that once you're revered with Tillers you can plant the seeds that grow into motes and get at least 12 of those (perhaps more) every day.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Its only going to be a boring grind for those who do not raid, do dailies, or do dungeons. Aka PvPers, but then again why does a pvp only player need to craft? If your doing 25 dailies a day or even 10 your going to come across mob kill quests and these things will drop rare or not. If your doing dungeon runs to cap what ever currency they are doing in MoP your going to come across these as a drop rare or not. Raids as well.<br />
<br />
Do i agree with this system? Well they do want players out in the world and not sitting in town all day but it seems players like yourself dont want to be out in the world.<br />
<br />
As for punishing healers thats laughable. With Dual spec all healers cept priests will have a dps or tank off spec with the new talent system. (some priests might do disc/holy) so thats not even an issue. Plus healers still get loot from mobs in dungeons and raids.<br />
<br />
As for wasted inventory i think not. Depends how much it stacks and how much you need for crafting. If the motes stack to 150-200 do you really think your going to be running around with 1000+ in your bags if your not crafting anything? and if the primals stack 100+ do you really thing youll be caring those around without anything to craft.<br />

<br />
Right now it looks like you dont need any to level profs to 600 but if you can trade them for mats/discoveries it might make it easier. The real problem is going to be for people who wanted to have their lvl 80 alts sit in the city like always and craft away. Now they will have to be at least lvl 85 to go to Panadaria and farm some motes to make certain items. <br />
<br />
At first I thought this would be a real hassle to have to go and farm these on all my crafting alts to make items to sell. Then I looked at what they are used in and its really only first tier epic armor, heroic level weapons, LW armor kits, and cards for darkmoon decks. Since they are more readily available than chaos orbs were it should be easier to find people with them and they should be cheaper. I make a lot of gold off LW kits but not so much epic armors except trade crafting so I would realistically only need to farm enough to keep some in stock and for the extra uses. The real problem is that currently the darkmoon cards require 10 each(which will probably be reduced) so it would require scribes to farm hundreds of them to make 1 deck.</div></div><hr />

they are really really easy to farm, and they exist for the sole purpose of getting you out in the world.<br />

<br />
sure this will get ppl out of the citys. maybe not best option, but still if you want to make epics you are forced out. <br />
<br />
If they only removed the chance to buy raw mats also, it would be great. that takes away any real reason for a script / bot to farm those.<br />
<br />
And if they would only make so new patterns can be in need of all sorts of mats from Vanilla to today it would bring more life into the entire World. <br />

Tho i agree that the spirits should be BoA at start.</div></div><hr />

I also believe they should be BoA, this will be a nightmare for quite a few players such as myself. who have 1 of every profession, at least make them BoA Blizz so we do not have to constantly farm! I enjoy only having to farm on 1 of my toons (That has Herbalism and Mining) because it means I can do everything from that 1 toon... I am still out in the world aren't I reguardles of what toon I do it on.<br />

Traduction:<br />
SoH vendor offer crap ratio for resources, as such you'll never want to use SoH on resources if you have tailor/BS/LW/JC or alchimy (arguably eng at least at first). <br />
And toons without those professions are effectively wasting SoH on the vendor. Once the extremely early overprices resources wave is over (couple of weeks max) i expect every player on those toons will hold onto their SoH hoping for a BoE or at least BoA modification.<br />

However being BoA would be much better, but then again, the orbs are always BOP in the first tier of an expansion, and raids will drop their own crafting material.<br />
<br />
Yes isn't it amazing how fast people forget that Chaos Orbs were bop early in cata. And not like they are that hard to get, I would say about every 3 or 4 mobs killed would have a mote or 2 on them. (Not sure this is a guesstimate from beta.)</div></div><hr />

And yet, it's been the motto for this whole expansion; Getting people out into the world. Why is it people keep acting so surprised when something is introduced to the game that actually pulls people in that direction?<br />
<br />
Also, with the exception of the three actual crafting professions, getting these things are entirely optional. It's just there if you want to boost your profession. Why do you expect to be given a significant boost like an extra transmute by simply buying a primal on the AH?</div></div><hr />

Chaos Orbs could only be rolled on by people with professions that could use them, and if you wanted to be guaranteed one you could just do a guild dungeon one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
except that getting them out in the world is much easier.<br />
<br />
in D/RF you have to compete against 4 other people for motes at the same droprate as out in the world with mobs that take longer to kill even in a group. getting those solo is much more efficient and smart people will do so.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And half the time you never got the orb because someone else won it. But the main thing being is that every killable mob in Pandaria has a good chance of dropping these new motes. You don't have to kill the last boss in any thing to get them unlike Chaos Orbs. And dont forget how long it took for them to finally be BoE.</div></div><hr />

I think as most of the comments also say, they should start out as BoA if they start out BoP i'm going to be restricted to only leveling certain profession characters first because it would be a waste of time to get to 90 on say my alt that has mining/skinning and have all those motes sitting around not being used, i'm not sure how many other people have characters like this but for me it will be annoying not having the freedom to level the character i want too, which is what ever one i find fun not only the ones with crafting professions.</div></div><hr />

I dont see how this should have any impact on the AH-sitters. CO's were BoP too still you can buy the end-product or the mats. So this shouldn't have any influence.<br />
<br />
Also I dont need to go dungeons any longer, I can get them while doing dailies,skinning or raiding.<br />
<br />
If I dont need them I can trade them into something I do need (and can send it to the char who needs it).<br />

You can still do that. What most people fail to realize is that these things are only mandatory when actually creating epic items. For everything else it's completely optional. You can max out all your professions just fine without them.<br />

BS, LW and Tailoring make gear, so that's not changing. It's the fact that other professions get to use them as well. It's a great idea. Plus, for example currently in alchemy you can transmute gems such as 3 carnalians and 3 heart blossoms into an inferno ruby. That's just too easy and Blizzard knows this. They looked at the AH's across the board and notice the amount of items in the AH. It's gotten out of control. So, to transmute into the next &quot;red&quot; gem in Mists, you need a spirit of harmony. That should cut down on the insane amount in the AH that we've had all through Cata.</div></div><hr />

I know huh? it's asinine. People think BC is the best expansion ever and they want WOW to be like that again. Blizzard has gone back to the roots of WoW and implemented some old school stuff, people still aren't happy. Blizzard really can't win. I love the way Mists is shaping up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Right now you dont need them to level. People jump to conclusions without doing research. 90% of the items you can craft with them require you to gain rep with lvl 90 daily quests to get the patterns so you wont even really need them until you are 90.<br />
<br />
Now they will probably be required for T15/16 raid dropped patterns which might be BOE but by then you have time to level a few crafting alts to 85 so you can get some motes from the leveling zones. Or the raid patterns could always be BOP like in TBC.<br />
<br />
Also professions make the most gold by shuffling raw mats into gems, enchanting mats, belt buckles ect which will also not require them or even require max level.</div></div><hr />

Yup. It's a good idea. No fighting with other people and you can farm as much or as little as you want. For people that don't have the profession and want an item, it sucks, but you can always ask a guildie to farm and trade with them something in return for example. As for me talking about needing them for transmuting gems, I am mistaken. They used to be in the beta, but it was since removed. I don't like that, that means the AH will be flooded again. I thought needing spirit of harmony to transmute a gem would have helped a lot. :(</div></div><hr />

Couldn't agree more. I like that they're considering making them BoA. My blacksmith doesn't get played much but she needs more mats to support the toons I do play. But keeping them off the ah is a good move IMO. It takes the place of volatiles so gold farmers can't stand there all day ruining the economy quite as easily. I have no issues with this new system at all. I am an advocate to make them boa though. As some profs will need more than others.<br />

<br />
No, a very loud minority thinks BC was the best expansion ever. Last time they tried to bring back the BC feel with some difficulty in dungeons and raids, people just gave up and they reversed to easy-mode in 4.3, since less then 10% of the playerbase actually downed anything in the previous tiers.<br />
<br />
Yet here we are again with &quot;Grinding is so much fun! We'll just add a mandatory thing that requires people to dumbly farm mobs!&quot;. At least the previous orbs dropped from dungeons, it required a little bit of gameplay to get them. Now we'll get the MoP equivalent of farming wolves in Elwynn. It's gonna feel so rewarding indeed...<br />
<br />
And it's BoP, so you'll have to farm mobs on every single character to get them. I could live with it if they were BoA from launch and I could at least choose on which toon to farm them. Their big motto for MoP was to let us choose what we want to do in the game, &quot;You want to craft anything valuable? Go farm mobs!&quot; doesn't look like much of a choice...</div></div><hr />

<br />
They want to use their alts to craft all the best stuff for their mains but claim they cannot because they can't transfer Harmony instead of grinding it out on their alt as that alt won't be level 90.<br />
<br />
Don't the best patterns come from the factions that require you to be level 90 and do dailies for their rep?<br />
<br />
So unless you get that alt to 90 he won't have the best gear to craft anyway...<br />
<br />
And if you are simply referring to items such as potions they do not require Harmony nor do you need Harmony to reach max profession.</div></div><hr />

Cause grinding factions on every single character is gonna be so much fun too! Unless they make factions account-wide, MoP will turn into an horrible grind fest.

No, you won't. There is absolutely no need for the Harmonies for levelling professions. The only place where they're required is for crafting epics, which will be relatively rare for some time, just as it was with previous expacks.<br />

I guess the part that goes:<br />
<br />
<br />
While not every profession will get equal value out of them, most everyone will need to collect them for one reason or another.<br />
<br />
Nothing will ever be required. However, sometimes the other options are just not interesting enough to consider them. In this case, if you want to max out your professions and get the most out of them, judging by the article you will need Harmonies.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think as most of the comments also say, they should start out as BoA. If they start out BoP, I'm going to be restricted to only leveling certain profession characters first because it would be a waste of time to get to 90 on, say, my alt that has mining/skinning and have all those motes sitting around not being used. I'm not sure how many other people have characters like this, but for me it will be annoying not having the freedom to level the character I want to (which is whatever one I find fun not only the ones with crafting professions).<br />
Download AdBlock and AdBlock+. Those browser addons have done wonders for me on this website.<br />
<br />
I agree, people ought to farm on whichever character they prefer. I miss the by-gone days of the Frozen Orb, which was never BoP, as I could farm dungeons for them on my geared main to use for my profession alts. :(<br />
<br />
Here's to hoping Blizzard makes the motes and spirits BoA by release (or no later than 5.1).<br />

How is this different from collecting Chaos Orbs in Cataclysm? If you want something extra, be it money or epic gear (or perhaps an additional transmute in Mists), you have to do something extra to earn it. Nothing has changed, it's just taken on another appearance this time.<br />

Well, except orbs were far less used than this new material.<br />
The worst being it's BoP when they could have made it BoA.<br />
So I'll have to grind with a character that I have nothing to do just to get this material, all the while I could play with another character that I need to play anyway (for reputation, for example).<br />
<br />
Oh well, Blizzard is making a lot of stupid decisions these last few years, I guess it's going to last until WoW goes into oblivion.</div></div><hr />

Again, other than for crafting epic gear, where is it required in your profession? It's nothing more than a bonus you can get if you put work into it. Despite what many doomsayers claim, nothing in this game comes for free. You do have to put in a certain amount of work.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is no disadvantages to making it BoA and keeping the drop rate relatively decent. It just means that if I level one of my characters to 90, and get geared out in lots of Heroic Gear (And raid gear later) in the first week, I'll be able to go to Jade Forest and run around farming the Motes of Spirit really easily. But then if I want to make a something from Alchemy for my Main, then I have to swap to my 85 Druid, and slow as a snail either just level him and collect as I kill for leveling, or Grind and Grind. <br />
<br />
It's just annoying and pointless. With a decent drop rate and BoA, people can't really abuse the Perk System and it helps out immensely with those people with multiple Alts and lots of Professions.<br />
<br />
However that said, I do like the change, it's simpler and more efficient, I just don't see why they are trying to hold off on making them BoA.</div></div><hr />

It'll probably go BoA sooner or later.<br />

Besides, you won't need them for just the basic stuff. The only place where they're 100% required is if you're making epix. You can level your alts' professions just fine and dandy without these things.</div></div><hr />

You don't have to farm them. That's the whole point. You can level your stuff fine without them, they're just there if you want something extra. There's nothing forcing anyone here.</div></div><hr />

Exacly ,thats EXACLY what its so annoying about this comunity. I LOVE this game but the comunity EACH day shocks me more and more. Blizzard is Forceing you to get out of SW/ORG sure , but thats the idea the idea is for you to work your way up in obtaining things. Even if its something as simple as killing mobs around the world. And then probably the same people that say OMFG BC&gt;ALL say this is bad. Terrible comunity is terrible. The BoA thing is comeing later on , they will keep it BoP to reduce the amount of epics and goodies on the AH right on release. Please people think and analize before you jump on Bandwagons.</div></div><hr />

It is diferent than the Fire / Water / Life / Shadow / Earth mote system, wich after 3 expansions I was getting tired of it. Having our alters farming out there is not that horrible, you will play another class and will discover the world in another way, so it's an improvement compared to stay in Orgrimmar and farm the AH. Blizzard heard that people wanted things to be like in the beginings, where things you got needed effort to get, so here it is a system wich asks you to do something.<br />
<br />
Concerning the subject of farming with a healer: I had to farm Living Essence and Golden Pearl during Vainilla with a Holy Priest whith a shiny Benediction over my head that made me the easy target for PvP campers, there was no double speck, and I'm still alive.<br />
<br />
And yeah, BoP materials are a mess if you have to buy them from anothr crafter who has to have them, but it makes you interact with people, search for cheap crafters, and this moves a little the comunity of the server. And BS, LW ans Tailorers at least get some profit from it, for me this 3 professions are the worst to level up.<br />
<br />
IMO, Thumbs Up for this new system.</div></div><hr />

It's not? A lot of people also complained quite a bit about those orbs being BoP at the beginning of the expansion. Whether the majority of people actually agree or disagrees with the most vocal responses, at least the actual response it's consistent.</div></div><hr />

Wasn't the point of the BMAH offering heroic tier gear so that AH players had a viable &quot;progression&quot; path via making gold?<br />
<br />
Doesn't that contradict this change?<br />
<br />
This shouldn't hurt too many raiders too much, unless they're going some combo of JC/Enchanting/BS (when they're not plate wearers). If they then want that epic that's going to give them the edge in week 1 of raiding, they're going to have to rely on a guildie, or have an alt who can grind some of these up pretty immediately. I still don't like it because it a) forces you to have alts if you want to min/max (seeing as JC/BS is usually top in early xpac before epic gems), and b) forces you to play those alts.<br />
<br />
I thought TBC was a great expansion, but the worst part of it was the grindy-ness. They hear people clamoring for TBC like raids (in that not completing them is okay, and not expected or entitled), and then they bring back the worst part of TBC.<br />

<br />
I do think the majority hate that they're BoP and it's a huge drawback for people who need something and don't have the profession. It forces people to either level up a profession or bug people for something and get THEM to farm them up. But at the same time BoP means bad news for bots. I also like as someone mentioned, that it forces you to go into the world and farm them. Eventually they will become BoE, but overall I think it's a great system. No more hassle of having to farm 4 different types of primals. IE fire, water, air, water. One kind, used for everything and drops off any mob. Perfect. :)</div></div><hr />

From a financial standpoint, grindy-ness is what makes the subscriptions float. It's understandable that many people don't like grinding but adding it back into the game is objectively a positive to both gameplay and subscriptions.<br />
<br />
OT: Looks interesting. This should encourage people to double-up on those dailies since you can get basically everything from them now, from VP and rep to gold and (now) BoP crafting mats.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm sure I will but you missed my point. Basically I'd be forced to level the characters in order to use the professions effectively; leg armors from my leatherworker and leg threads from my tailor for example, if there is no alternative path to maxing the profession without the BoP materials.<br />
<br />
I have every profession covered by my alts so my account is entirely self sufficient, however I prefer to level the characters individually when I feel inclined to play the class. If I have to level to 90 in order to acquire the mats to max the profession it takes the game play choice out of my hands.<br />
<br />
To take it a step further, with the number of alts I have I prefer to take the path of least resistance to max level once I get the main finished.<br />
<br />
Anyway as I said, hopefully there are alternative points available through crafting that won't require me to level the alts right away.<br />
<br />
<br />
Did you actually read the article? Outside of crafting epixxxx, where is it required to farm Harmonies?<br />
<br />
I think maybe you're the one jumping to conclusions. It doesn't say anywhere in the article you won't need them to level the professions. It does however mention some possible alternative uses by profession.<br />
<br />
In addition to serving as a core crafting ingredient, Spirit of Harmony can also be used to purchase a variety of additional bonuses or materials that your character may need. While not every profession will get equal value out of them, most everyone will need to collect them for one reason or another.<br />
<br />
Either way the characters get leveled, some of you just get a little too defensive when anyone questions a change.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Morgomir</div><div class="date">2012-08-16, 05:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">well for tailoring you don't need them for any current patterns as you can make 1 imperial silk a day with just 8 bolts of cloth you can make additional imperial silk each day with 5 bolts and a spirit of harmony<br />

the spirit of harmony vendor in Vale of Eternal Blossoms sells nearly every crafting material in various stack sizes for 1 spirit of harmony<br />
you will have a nice pile of spirits by the time u hit 90<br />

Adapt.<br />
<br />
Do you really want to be doing the same thing every expansion? It gets so boring. Making a million or two with your crafters and AH characters is so easy now. It's just boring. What the game needs is a change to the design at its core and that's what they seem to be doing. Everyone is affected by these changes so you have to adapt and devise a winning strategy. It's a challenge.. and that's what we needed as the game was becoming incredibly stale.</div></div><hr />

I honestly fail to see how it's &quot;screwing over crafting alts&quot; unless you use those alts to make epic gear. And even then you'll only need a handful of them.<br />

Somewhat off-topic reminder: The world premiere of the Mists of Pandaria cinematic will show at 2pm local time tomorrow, which will be 5am PDT / 8am EDT in the US. (Assuming I did the time converting correctly.)<br />
<br />
You did. :)</div></div><hr />

Basically I'd be forced to level the characters in order to use the professions effectively; leg armors from my leatherworker and leg threads from my tailor for example, if there is no alternative path to maxing the profession without the BoP materials.<br />
<br />
I have every profession covered by my alts so my account is entirely self sufficient, however I prefer to level the characters individually when I feel inclined to play the class. If I have to level to 90 in order to acquire the mats to max the profession it takes the game play choice out of my hands.<br />
Yes, I too have a lot of crafting alts. And apparently, leaving them at 85 to max a profession is a bad thing according to the game designers.<br />
I also might add, that you actually CAN leave some of those at 85. Alchemy for example, has only 1 use for spirits (free extra transmutes) which means that your alchemists can happily make flasks, pots and other stuff at 85.<br />
<br />
Also, to be an effective crafter in MOP, you will need faction-based recipes, and in order to do that, you will need to level. I might add, it's exactly the same mechanic as in Cata, where you couldn't purchase Twilight Highlands recipes before 84, yet apparently this didn't bother anyone.<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyway as I said, hopefully there are alternative points available through crafting that won't require me to level the alts right away.<br />
Just to clarify: you don't need spirits to max your profession. At all. However you will probably need to get into the world and quest with the factions selling the recipes. Just like in Cata.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
In addition to serving as a core crafting ingredient, Spirit of Harmony can also be used to purchase a variety of additional bonuses or materials that your character may need. While not every profession will get equal value out of them, most everyone will need to collect them for one reason or another.<br />
We have MOP Beta for that :) Spirits, asides from crafting, can be used to purchase ingredients from a vendor. E.g. a stack of ore, 20 random herbs, skins, crystals and so on. That's the additional materials. They also allow some crafters (e.g. alchemists and JCs) to get free research and transmutes without incurring the cooldown.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well for a start, they're useful to all professions - no more killing dungeon bosses and seeing 3/5 of the group get something you'll have to pay for later.</div></div><hr />

So now I have to take my crafters out into the world and kill mobs for these motes? Sorry, but I'd rather be playing my main toons. Sometimes Blizzard is absolutely brilliant and sometimes they just don't get it. I think this falls into the latter category. At least make them BoA.<br />
<br />
You would have to Do a donjon and win the orb at the end, just to get one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Spirits of Harmony can be used to purchase raw mats. With that fact in mind the price of raw mats will nose dive as they will be more openly available. Not to mention those professions that need mats once in a blue moon can buy them from a vendor instead of dropping a huge chunk of cash on the AH.</div></div><hr />

Most gamers actually realised they had a life and don't feel like grinding mobs for an entire day to be able to craft a few pieces for their characters anymore.<br />
<br />
And WoW suffered because of it. Perhaps this new philosophy works in other segments of the video game market but not in the segment where the business model is built upon subscribers logging in every day.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Delaios</div><div class="date">2012-08-16, 02:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's one of the better solutions to getting people out of cities and rewarding people that venture out in the world. Having the Spirits BoP is going to be a bit of a problem for me because I supply myself with profession alts (they have all been 85 for 2 months or so). I'll get plenty of them on my main, who has Engineering and Alchemy. Alchemy provides me with a nice extra transmute, but Engineering has very limited use for spare Spirits. There are extra rewards for secondary professions, but I'd prefer to be able to send them to my JC to get extra plans, or buy extra herbs with my Herbalists. <br />
<br />
I do hope they make them BoA from the start, but I'll manage if they don't. But whatever they do, I hope they never make them BoE.</div></div><hr />

That's not a negative. xD</div></div><hr />
