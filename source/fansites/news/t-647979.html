Comparing DPS on Training Dummies<br />
When you only focus on Patchwerk or training dummies or simcraft, you can come up with a number that may be higher or lower than other specs or classes. The problem is that number is meaningless in many other fights. Do you have to move? Do you have to deal with adds? Do you have to swap out gear to improve your health? Do you run OOM? Is your threat too high? Do you need to free NPCs? All of those are &quot;real&quot; considerations on the actual bosses you're trying to kill.<br />
<br />
The real questions, which have somewhat frustratingly fuzzy answers, are: Do you justify a raiding slot? Are you pulling your weight? Would your group be better off replacing you? Does the rogue beat you because your class is undertuned or because it's a perfect fight for a rogue (or because you need to L2P)?

Balance DPS<br />
We think Balance dps is a little low on live, but changing Improved Moonkin Form to 30% Spirit to Spellpower in 3.1.2 should be something like a 5% spellpower boost to raid-buffed druids, which should be around a 5% dps increase. YMMV.<br />
<br />
Also keep in mind that the Ulduar fights are pretty diverse. Fights like XT are a dream for melee, especially rogues and cats. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/16903516723-a-moonkins-plea.html))<br />
<br />
Balance DPS Rotation<br />
Totally agree that Brain Freeze is a pretty good mechanic. It works though because Frost never wants to use Fireball normally. For Balance, we need to keep both nukes in play. The spec is less fun to play (for me anyway) when Starfire or Wrath clearly wins and you just nuke with that spell.<br />
<br />
An ideal rotation, if we can make it work, would be more like SF x 3-6 then Wrath x 3-6, with Insect Swarm, Moonfire and the rest thrown in as needed. The &quot;3-6&quot; means that if you switch at the wrong time, your dps is still decent, but if you switch at the right time, your dps is better. But it can't be a 100% predictable number or there is no learning -- no opportunity to improve your game -- involved. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/16903516723-a-moonkins-plea.html))<br />
<br />
Balance DPS in Ulduar<br />
As I've said a few times, it's pretty tricky to calculate &quot;real&quot; dps in Ulduar because there are so few Patchwerk-like fights. That is actually to some extent by design because it gets players to focus more on &quot;How do I maximize my dps on this fight?&quot; rather than &quot;What's my dps?&quot; But it does make estimating who is high or low tricky for both you and us. It's awesome you are taking names, and I'll attribute that to knowing how to gear and play your class. We do worry that the Scorch change hurt Balance and Elemental since we ended up partially compensating the mages.<br />
<br />
The basic design problem for Balance, as I know you know, comes down to Wrath and Stafire just being very similar spells. One is always going to win out by virtue of damage or cast time. Eclipse was our attempt to make which one wins more dynamic. I think it accomplishes that, but I think it's also fair to say that there aren't a ton of druids who are in love with the talent. Or maybe it's more fair to say that there are druids who just can't stand it. It's also not swell that the talent has driven many druids to mods to help manage it.<br />
<br />
We're not going to give you a rotation that ends up being something like SF, Wrath, SF, Wrath or even SF x4, Wrath x4. We just think that's too boring and ultimately bad for the game. You can argue that you like Balance because it's very predictable and macro-able, but it should be clear that we view that as a problem.<br />
<br />
I'm in total hand-waving, brainstorm mode here. This is not a design we have cooking that we're all ready to implement, but imagine Eclipse worked something like this: Every Starfire you cast has a 20% cumulative chance of making your next Wrath do 30% more damage. So after SF1, the chance is 20%, but after SF5 the chance is 100%. That encourages you to swap spells somewhat randomly, but less random than the system we have now. The goal is to have something where you sometimes switch after SF 3 and sometimes after SF 5. Good druids would always switch at the right time and those who are still trying to maximize their potential could get better about switching at the right time. You could also have a system where every SF has a chance of making Wrath slightly better, with a stack on that effect, so that at some point it's the right time to switch. Don't feel the need to point out how you could game this system -- I spent all of 2 minutes coming up with it. If and when we decide to change it, we'd put far more work into the design.

http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ihunters.gif Hunter (3.1 Skills List (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=620) / 3.1 Talent + Glyph Calc. (http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?hunter))<br />
Hunters in PvE<br />
1) Hunter dps was just too high through much of Naxx. Ideally hunters should be competing with locks, rogues and mages and for a lot of the LK content they were just head and shoulders above the rest.<br />
<br />
2) Currently, hunter dps might be a little low, but we're not 100% convinced yet. Some of the earlier fights in Ulduar are very melee friendly. XT is a rogue and cat's dream. We were pretty harsh to melee in Naxx with a lot of run-out moments and cleaves. Kologarn and other parts of Ulduar turn that on the ranged a little and require them to focus more on situational awareness. We think the later fights in Ulduar are a little more ranged-friendly, and we're waiting to get more parses from those. Plenty of guilds are on or have beaten Yogg by now, but the current data are pretty noisy since people are still learning the encounters.<br />
<br />
3) We understand Vezax is a special case for hunters. By the same token, our goal is not to have every class do the same relative dps on every boss. Some fights are just better for some than others. Our goal isn't even to have &quot;the shadow priest fight&quot; or &quot;the fury warrior fight.&quot; We just want diversity. We really wanted the Ulduar encounters to push players more towards &quot;What can I do to improve my dps on this fight?&quot; and less on &quot;What is my dps?&quot;<br />
<br />
4) Survival may still be slightly higher than BM or MM. We don't think it's off by 1000 dps in most cases. It's something we want to keep looking at. We understand some Marks hunters say they'd be fine if it weren't for mana. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/16904206957-hunter-balanceblizzards-opinion--attempt-2.html))<br />
<br />
Hunters in PvP<br />
1) The TNT stuns and the uber mana drains were just too good last season. Sorry. Those aren't coming back.<br />
<br />
2) Last season, burst spell damage was very high. That put a premium on active defenses, which ended up being a good niche for hunters. Last season there was almost no reason to bring a warrior; rogues and hunters brought the MS debuff in a stronger form as well as a host of additional utility. Warriors are back now, which means more competition for that spot.<br />
<br />
3) This season has seen different classes rising to the top. Priests are rogues are good. Arms and Ret are good, depending on who you believe. We are nerfing or have nerfed some of those classes, which should open up the top playing-field a little. We are getting rid of Exorcism allowing paladins to two-shot pets. I'd agree that hunter representation is a little low at the moment, but we're not sure the class needs massive buffs so much as others need some nerfs.<br />
<br />
4) Hunters are betters in 5s than 2s. It's really challenging to have every class or spec have the same representation in small teams as large, which is one of the reasons we offer multiple sizes. Recently the community seems to be focusing on 2s even more than 3s. We are taking some steps to make sure the larger brackets are as rewarding as the smaller ones. (I'm not saying it's a goal that some classes are only viable for some brackets. But it is nice that if you aren't as good for some brackets, you always have the others to fall back on.) (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/16904206957-hunter-balanceblizzards-opinion--attempt-2.html))<br />
<br />
Steady Shot<br />
We'd be unlikely to buff Steady Shot, for the same reasons we nerfed it before. If we need to buff hunters, we'd likely do it in other ways. We'd also be unlikely to buff pet damage. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/16904206957-hunter-balanceblizzards-opinion--attempt-2.html))<br />
<br />
[...] We admit mistakes when we make them. Nerfing SS was for a good reason. Since you seem unwilling to go research it, the reason was that it is a very simple attack that requires almost no finesse, skill or timing to play. You just push the button and get some damage. The larger the portion of your damage from SS becomes, the less the other attacks even matter. As SS damage approaches 100%, you can just take those other buttons off your bar completely. Having &quot;white damage&quot; (which this virtually is) account for a large chunk of melee damage is marginally acceptable where the class has to at least do something to stay on a target. Just plinking away from range and doing massive damage with one button is not. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/16904206957-hunter-balanceblizzards-opinion--attempt-2.html))<br />
<br />
Pet scaling from buffs<br />
Pets scaling from buffs is a problem. If we had the tech, we would let pets benefit from buffs but prevent the pet from getting extra scaling from the same buffs on the hunter. That would solve some of the problem. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/16904206957-hunter-balanceblizzards-opinion--attempt-2.html))<br />

Warriors in Arena<br />
Warriors have plate, shields and Defensive Stance and virtually no active defenses. I think warriors are doing better because DKs are more balanced now and because warriors got Juggernaut. If we nerfed Juggernaut into the ground (which we aren't going to do), then I think you'd see warriors collapse again. Maybe.

So only ONE class should be able to remove those? There's still 8 classes that cant do shit about those invulnerabilities, god forbid only 2 can do something about it.<br />

<br />
<br />
Yeah because an extra 25% healing reduction is totally better than you not being able to even cast for 4 seconds. I wish people would learn to fucking think instead of QQing about it. To clarify:<br />
<br />
WE DON'T HAVE AN INTERUPT IN BATTLE STANCE (THE ONE WE DPS IN). BECAUSE OF THIS WE HAVE OVERPOWER , WHICH ONLY WORKS IF WE USE IT ON YOU WHILE CASTING -- THE SAME THING AS AN INTERUPT EXCEPT WORSE BECAUSE IT'S ONLY ANOTHER 25% HEALING REDUCTION (IF MS IS ALREADY ON THE TARGET) INSTEAD OF JUST A SILENCE.<br />
<br />
Honestly I'm sorry for the caps but I hate the QQ about this. I would gladly (and honestly I would much prefer) pummel being able to be used in battle stance instead of overpower. Pummel doesn't need to proc (even if it is 100% off rend ticks for overpower), pummel doesn't effect the GCD (overpower does) and pummel isn't a main source of damage for us (while overpower is and saving it for casts nerfs our damage). <br />
<br />
<br />
Really warriors aren't even at the top by any means, I don't see the reason to QQ about it. ::)</div></div><hr />

Warriors are ridiculous at the moment. 15 second cooldown Intercept that stuns, Charge in combat causing a guaranteed MS crit, -75% undispellable healing debuff, Spamstring, Imp Spamstring, and Bladestorm are way too much. Not to mention being able to throw on a macro'ed sword and board in combat and lol over any melee hitting them just proccing more rage and still hitting like a god damn truck.<br />

Really, you QQ about hamstring? Rogues slow is a 70% that they just have to auto attack to put on. DK's Chains of Ice starts off as a root. Hamstring is not the skill to QQ about.<br />

<br />
Yeah I hit a TON with my 1H. If I'm lucky I might get a ONE THOUSAND CRIT with mortal strike! Of course it doesn't matter that most players will still tear through us even with a shield on, I mean it's another 10% less damage taken and we do no damage period. Also to a certain point more rage does not equal more damage, ESPECIALLY for arms warriors. <br />

<br />
You guys are so out of line with this whine about juggernaut.. <br />
Lets put it this way we take every class put it up against every other class and we wouldnt have a 100% win anywhere.<br />
<br />
Mages ( who are complaining) should l2p and realise no melee dps in game can take them if they know how to play.<br />
<br />
And you guys are totally oblivious to the fact that our only to comparable classes are paladin and DKs they both use plate and use 2handers.. Only difference is pala has self healing and bubble and DKs have a ton of defensive buffs (waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay better then warriors) AND selfhealing aswell..<br />
<br />
Warriors have 1 self healing and the procs thats it. We have the worst defensive capability of all three classes oh and both DKs and Paladins both use magical dmg of some sort (icy touch holy dmg and so on) we only have physical dmg. That is also a huuuuge downer against stuff like healers..<br />
<br />
Yeah i agree the additional 25% healing reduce is op sure remove that.. But the juggernaut thing noo.. That is pretty much the only thing working for warriors ATM as GC said. <br />
<br />
Warriors should be the hardest class to kill ingame.. Cause they lack selfhealing and serious usable defensive capabilities but sadly no.. Blizzard turned us into a burst class.. OKAY im dealing with that but LEAVE US THE FUCK ALONE THEN if that is what we are let us atleast be that.<br />
<br />
Fucking whiners rogues beat warriors 90% of the time if they know to play.. dual disarm and we should be dead. Mage warlocks and so on should be us. Tho against warlocks its 50/50 all healers own us if they dont suck. hunters win against us maybe less now that we can charge more but still. DKs and Palas win EVERY TIME they are just better warriors then warriors are period. We have nothing on them..<br />
<br />
<br />
So stop you jammering and focus on the real up classes you nabs.</div></div><hr />

Yeah I hit a TON with my 1H. If I'm lucky I might get a ONE THOUSAND CRIT with mortal strike! Of course it doesn't matter that most players will still tear through us even with a shield on, I mean it's another 10% less damage taken and we do no damage period. Also to a certain point more rage does not equal more damage, ESPECIALLY for arms warriors. <br />
<br />
Yeah we don't have to stance dance. That is, unless we want that intercept you QQed about, our real interupt, our &quot;amazing&quot; defense you QQed about...<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
If your MS is only critting for 3k your gear is god awful. Judging by your armory...<br />
<br />
You don't need to Pummel any short casts. -75% healing debuff means that anything you target dies. No healer can heal through that. Ever. Or you know, you can take two steps backwards and just stun them in the middle of a cast whenever your Intercept is up.<br />
<br />
With 75% less healing, Bladestorm = good game. Which is on a 75 second cooldown by the way, glad to know you don't understand your own class' talents and glyphs. Bladestorm to Charge crit MS to Execute is unhealable when what would be a 12k crit heal hits for maybe 3k.<br />
<br />
And yes, I consider Intercept on a pseudo 15 second cooldown since you either do that every 25 seconds or charge every 12.<br />
<br />
EDIT: To the poster above me, this game is called World of Meleecraft for a reason. DKs, Rets, Rogues, and now Warriors too are ridiculous. I'm not saying only Wars should be hit by the nerf-bat, but the fact that just about every melee class in this game has high burst, high utility, high mobility, and high defenses with little to no tradeoff.</div></div><hr />

Yes, we're overpowered because you can't move out of Mana Burn or tell your partner to interrupt it. Stop backpeddling and standing in the middle of the arena and wondering where all your mana went.<br />
<br />
... and if you're about to mention something about Rogues on you, maybe you should reconsider who you're calling overpowered.<br />
<br />
Btw, any glimpse of superiority we may have had went out the window one week into the season with Ghostcrawler's knee-jerk reaction causing Rogue/Druid to be more OP than we ever were.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Better gear, higher crits. What about our 3k-to-5k crits on a 15 second cooldown exorcism? That's only dmg not including a 50% reduce healing. Wasn't OP at all in my opinion. Heals are so huge now, 5k tops dmg(on a bad geared person) is nothing, thats what, one 1.5 second heal or maybe two of them? I can get hit from a caster for that much with 700+ resilience on 6 second or less skills. Paladin's got nothing against healers, while most of other classes got something. Why is that? Because Paladin's(talking from Ret perspective)CAN heal themselves so no need to give them a less than 7 second cooldown interrupt ? So we heal ourselves then we end up with no mana and we can't do anything but auto attack or perhaps cause we got a bubble which doesn't really benifit us as much if we were holy. Would be nice, chance on hit grant the ability to cast exorcism on an humanoid. &lt;-- that would be nice.</div></div><hr />

Considering I have a ulduar 25 weapon (rune edge) I don't see how my gear can be &quot;horrible&quot;. And sure, I crit for 4.5k-5k on rogues and clothies, but against a plate, no way. <br />
<br />
Sure, if I go in FULL PVE (http://img4.imageshack.us/img4/1892/fullpve.png) gear than I might have a chance to do these higher crits, but mortal strike simply does not hit for that much, I mean I don't know what else to tell you there man. Just ask any warrior what their average mortal strike crits for, it isn't that much.<br />

<br />
<br />
And pummel is still a better skill than a total 75% MS, that's what you don't get. What would you rather have:<br />
<br />
A 75% MS for 6 seconds.<br />
B not be able to cast at all for 6 seconds.<br />
<br />
And two steps back? If I'm snared (which I should be in the arena) you can easily 5-8 me.<br />
<br />
<br />
With 75% less healing, Bladestorm = good game. Which is on a 75 second cooldown by the way, glad to know you don't understand your own class' talents and glyphs. Bladestorm to Charge crit MS to Execute is unhealable when what would be a 12k crit heal hits for maybe 3k.<br />
<br />
Ok, 1.5 min CD not 2 min, yes I said the wrong thing. I really would like to know your class before we went any further just because I'm sure I can tell you some things to do. I assume you're a healer in which:<br />
<br />
edit: just looked and your a disc. Figures. go QQ somewhere else because someone can actually do some damage to you. Or, perhaps, actually have your DK partner do something like death grip, chains of ice, ect. and let you get away. No excuse to be dying.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
And yes, I consider Intercept on a pseudo 15 second cooldown since you either do that every 25 seconds or charge every 12.<br />
<br />
<br />
That's nice that you consider it that but it doesn't change that it is a 25 second CD, so I don't see how you can use that against me. <br />

<br />

The reason why excorcism was so bad is that it was just another ability you could chain together for burst, not as much the same as mortal strike.</div></div><hr />

Slow down there turbo. I was commenting a previous post talking about why Warriors are doing better in arena, I never said Priests should be the only ones who can dispel Bubble/IB.<br />
<br />
On the other hand I don't understand why warriors get MS PLUS this dispel plus all their other utility. Seems a bit utility-heavy on an already DPS-strong class. Giving priests mass-dispel made sense because priests don't have heavy dps.</div></div><hr />

Since you seem to be blind:<br />
WE DON'T HAVE AN INTERUPT IN BATTLE STANCE (THE ONE WE DPS IN). BECAUSE OF THIS WE HAVE OVERPOWER , WHICH ONLY WORKS IF WE USE IT ON YOU WHILE CASTING -- THE SAME THING AS AN INTERUPT EXCEPT WORSE BECAUSE IT'S ONLY ANOTHER 25% HEALING REDUCTION (IF MS IS ALREADY ON THE TARGET) INSTEAD OF JUST A SILENCE.<br />
<br />
You really should learn to play your class before you go posting away like this... what the hell do you think tactical mastery is for you moron? you can do it with one of two ways, go def stance and shield bash or you can zerker and pummel them... btw do you know that charge has a stun on it? that would really suck if a warr could run back 8 yards and charge to interupt another heal... oh wait... good thing warr's cant spell reflect peels like cyclone,root,hex,chains,etc... oh wait...<br />
<br />
<br />
root[/i]. Hamstring is not the skill to QQ about. [/quote\<br />
Well for one, rogues don't have an undispellable snare and secondly rogues dont have a way of instantly getting back to the snared target like charge, don't say they have sstep because sub really is not viable and as easy as dk chains are to dispel, its no where near as bad as piercing howl/hamstring used in conjunction with bladestorm...<br />
<br />
[quote]<br />
And bladestorm, honestly, it's every 2 minutes. Learn to deal. <br />
It'd still be just as good as it is if it had a 5 min cd, any good warr almost always gets a kill with it...<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Yeah I hit a TON with my 1H. If I'm lucky I might get a ONE THOUSAND CRIT with mortal strike! Of course it doesn't matter that most players will still tear through us even with a shield on, I mean it's another 10% less damage taken and we do no damage period. Also to a certain point more rage does not equal more damage, ESPECIALLY for arms warriors. <br />
the point is you can go defensive stance, shield, and shield wall when your partner is cc'd its not meant to last the match, its meant to outlast your partners cc, again learn to play your class already and stop nerd raging<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Yeah we don't have to stance dance. That is, unless we want that intercept you QQed about, our real interupt, our &quot;amazing&quot; defense you QQed about... <br />
please for the love of god learn to play<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Yeah because an extra 25% healing reduction is totally better than you not being able to even cast for 4 seconds. I wish people would learn to fucking think instead of QQing about it<br />
sigh...<br />
<br />
you can't say warrs are not op when you have...<br />
<br />
-75% healing dps<br />
-interupts<br />
-7 charge/intercepts a min<br />
-bladestorm<br />
-plate<br />
-stupidly high rate of crits (ms and overpower from talents, ie juggernaut)<br />
-Near invulnerability when partner is cc'd and can also just intervene back around the corner for heals<br />
-shattering throw... are you kidding me? on top of all this you can break bubble and block!?<br />
-undispellable snares, aoe and single target... sigh<br />
<br />
all of this make for some incredible pressure on the opposing healer... incredible. Just maybe if you learn to play you could get out of the 1600's but if you can say that is not op, you truly are a retard. :-\</div></div><hr />

We're good, not OP. If we were OP you would be seeing something resembling S3/S4 on the SK100 yet SK100 is showing otherwise. Are we moving up? yes. Disc/Rogue is still a stronger comp and more represented one. [1] (http://www.sk-gaming.com/arena/team/2/all/all/all/all/) [2] (http://www.sk-gaming.com/arena/player/). Also I should say that the three melee dps are pretty much identical in 2v2 standings, warriors being a shy 1% ahead of rogue/DK. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
all of this make for some incredible pressure on the opposing healer... incredible. Just maybe if you learn to play you could get out of the 1600's but if you can say that is not op, you truly are a retard. <br />
<br />
Congratulations, you armoried me at a bad time. If you look at play history I've mostly been playing against 1800-1900 teams. However my shaman partner is still learning (as am I) and we have recently switched to a slightly more aggressive playstyle for him, so he is getting used to it. I could easily laugh at you for a 1900 rating as the most OP healer, but I won't. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I'd rather have the 75% MS like any day Tongue pummel doesnt last 6 secs?? Plus many classes have silence reducing talents, not to mention it's useless against melee. 75% is ridiculous!<br />
<br />
Meh. You do need to remember though that warriors have been asking for pummel in battle stance ever since WoTLK. We really didn't ask for unrelenting assault, and I'm sure a majority of the warrior playerbase would gladly trade it for an interupt. <br />
<br />
<br />
it really is ridiculous and i mean its not even like warr's are choosing between either, they have both pummel/shield bash and the 75% debuff---just every warr has half a brain from being hit so much tanking for 5 years that they don't realize they can stance dance interrupt with 1 button too<br />
<br />
And then we end up losing a lot of rage (up to 75 even if we are 3/3 tactical mastery, which if you notice in the general warrior PvP builds there is simply no room to take a full tactical mastery -- most take 1/3 so you can stance dance and disarm real quick) because of that. And, sure, we can do it (and I do) but we aren't going to be setting up much damage at all after that, and it's not like warriors are known for running with a second DPS either so you don't need to worry about someone else picking it up. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Missed this, but my shaman partner can not dispel chains of ice. And no, rogues don't have anything like charge (at least in a viable tree right now). However I have never really seen a rogue who has had issues with keeping up with a target if they are good.</div></div><hr />

Nope hunters are in a league of their own. I know you were being sarcastic but just wanted to point that out. World of Meleecraft arenas have really gone downhill, as you can tell by the warrior that's been rambling on here.

<br />
See what happens is, you dance to interrupt the heal, locking him for 4 seconds, yea you lose some rage, near then end you begin to run backwards and charge back in, locking him out of anything for another 1.5 seconds, interupt will be back soon and now he is extremely far behind simply because he already has a healing debuff of 75% as far as rage and dmg goes, you honestly arent losing as much damage as you think, charging back in gives you a garrunteed crit on the ms coming in like 3 seconds and an overpower (probably a crit) from rend ticks, throw in a well timed bladestorm and hex coming off his 5.5 sec lockout and its lights out - bladestorm and hex have such short cooldowns, that you guys can set up that burst many times allowing you maybe to screw it up or eat their cd's and then do it again for a kill. Either way, not interrupting is a bad idea, and if people dont dance they are bad, but will be ok against low brackest because of the rediculous healing debuff<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Again you failed to mention shield wall. You made it look like we could just throw on a shield and be fine, but in reality that isn't the case. Of course shield wall is a great tool to survive against one CC chain. You should really clarify what you are trying to complain about. <br />
<br />
huh? i said you go def stance and shield wall, but anyways, in terms of burst cd's, your comp's burst is up every 1.5 mins, which is lower than every other comps, so thats not an issue<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

I could easily laugh at you for a 1900 rating as the most OP healer, but I won't. <br />
hmm again, quoted me, but you armory'd someone else, you can find me here (http://www.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Durotan&amp;n=Animate) (as my name suggests :\)<br />

Meh. You do need to remember though that warriors have been asking for pummel in battle stance ever since WoTLK. We really didn't ask for unrelenting assault, and I'm sure a majority of the warrior playerbase would gladly trade it for an interupt. <br />
sure most of the player base, but i think the good warrior's are just lol'ing sitting back counting their arena points... stance dancing is not as bad as you make it out to be<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
And then we end up losing a lot of rage (up to 75 even if we are 3/3 tactical mastery, which if you notice in the general warrior PvP builds there is simply no room to take a full tactical mastery -- most take 1/3 so you can stance dance and disarm real quick) because of that. And, sure, we can do it (and I do) but we aren't going to be setting up much damage at all after that, and it's not like warriors are known for running with a second DPS either so you don't need to worry about someone else picking it up. <br />
stop all this about interupting is not worth it for damage loss, yes it is lol... he's not healing and the ammount of damage you could do without interrupting will be outhealed by a good healer. the interrupt/charge to hex/bstorm is what wins the games<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Missed this, but my shaman partner can not dispel chains of ice. And no, rogues don't have anything like charge (at least in a viable tree right now). However I have never really seen a rogue who has had issues with keeping up with a target if they are good. <br />
good resto druid &gt; good rogue, good resto &lt; good warrior <br />
<br />
no more confusing me with other people please <br />
edit: btw you contradict yourself all over the place, stop that too</div></div><hr />

Warriors have a weakness. They cant interrupt while in their current dps stance<br />

(http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?hunter))<br />
1) The TNT stuns and the uber mana drains were just too good last season. Sorry. Those aren't coming back.<br />
<br />
2) Last season, burst spell damage was very high. That put a premium on active defenses, which ended up being a good niche for hunters. Last season there was almost no reason to bring a warrior; rogues and hunters brought the MS debuff in a stronger form as well as a host of additional utility. Warriors are back now, which means more competition for that spot.<br />
<br />
3) This season has seen different classes rising to the top. Priests are rogues are good. Arms and Ret are good, depending on who you believe. We are nerfing or have nerfed some of those classes, which should open up the top playing-field a little. We are getting rid of Exorcism allowing paladins to two-shot pets. I'd agree that hunter representation is a little low at the moment, but we're not sure the class needs massive buffs so much as others need some nerfs.<br />
<br />
4) Hunters are betters in 5s than 2s. It's really challenging to have every class or spec have the same representation in small teams as large, which is one of the reasons we offer multiple sizes. Recently the community seems to be focusing on 2s even more than 3s. We are taking some steps to make sure the larger brackets are as rewarding as the smaller ones. (I'm not saying it's a goal that some classes are only viable for some brackets. But it is nice that if you aren't as good for some brackets, you always have the others to fall back on.)

You're a fucking moron GC. Completely retarded.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
It's sad when all people care about is the worst arena, 2v2. See what you're doing blizz?!<br />
<br />
<br />
We're last in 3v3 as well. And an epic 6th in 5v5. OMG 6th in the dead bracket where we're used solely as an MS bot. SO balanced as a class.</div></div><hr />

Ret pally was flavor of the 48 hours. They were nerfed even before WotLK came out and have never been over-represented in arenas ever.</div></div><hr />
