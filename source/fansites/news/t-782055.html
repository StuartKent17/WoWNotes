As the release of World of Warcraft: Cataclysm draws near, we continue to fine-tune various class abilities. Based on feedback and our own testing, we're in the process of assessing and amending tanking cooldowns -- at level 85 in particular. Some of these abilities, like druid Savage Defense and death knight self healing, are particularly difficult to model, so further testing will be necessary before there is sufficient information to base adjustments on.

As the release of World of Warcraft: Cataclysm draws near, we continue to fine-tune various class abilities. Based on feedback and our own testing, we're in the process of assessing and amending tanking cooldowns -- at level 85 in particular. Some of these abilities, like druid Savage Defense and death knight self healing, are particularly difficult to model, so further testing will be necessary before there is sufficient information to base adjustments on.<br />
<br />
In the case of paladins and warriors, we have recognized that it is possible for block chance to get too high too quickly and cause a situation where stacked mastery and the warrior Shield Block ability behave strangely. Since that's a scenario we want to avoid, we're making some changes regarding how block chance is handled for each of these classes:<br />
<br />
Paladins - Holy Shield will be changed to increase block value by 10% (40% total) instead of increasing block chance by 15%. Since this will cause Mastery to become more valuable, the amount of block granted by Mastery will be reduced to 2.25% block chance per point of Mastery, down from 3%.<br />
<br />
Warriors - At level 85, the value of Shield Block decreases as block value generated by Mastery increases. To remedy this, we will convert overflow of block + avoidance that exceeds 100% into critical block chance instead. Along with that change, Shield Block will be reduced to +25% block chance (down from +100%), but this will still yield a net buff for most warriors. Also in response to this change, the amount of block and critical block provided by Mastery will be equalized. Finally, Mastery will now grant 1.5% block chance per point.</div></div><hr />

Not sure what their intention is, are they trying to make the new mastery stat a bench warmer?<br />
<br />
Edit: Also I'm not convinced that nerfing shield block by 75% and critical block mastery by 1% while bringing the normal block mastery up by 0.25% is a buff. Think I'll be sticking with dodge, parry, and stam for the first tier for sure, then throwing on mastery once they become devalued at high gear levels.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Non-paladins cry about paladins loudest, as evidenced everywhere -- from these forums to Blizzcon attendees, yourself included.<br />
<br />
And if this really was a 'blizzard reacting to paladin crying to shut them up' as you so strongly support, then this is an odd way to go about it, seeing that this balancing change is effectively a nerf to block (by means to create value to mastery).<br />
<br />
TL;DR: you = logic fail</div></div><hr />

I think the servers will open at 9 a.m. due to patching? Dunno, was wondering the same, because if they open at 12a.m. that's 9 hours of potential play time wasted =&gt; it's more viable to go to a midnight launch.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I always go to midnight launch, mostly because I live one hour behind paris time so by the time I get home and its installed i'm ready for midnight :P + I kinda like the launch nights, usually have a few friends over and we play through the night, lotsa fun. Now I'm dissapointed that we're only going to start in the morning, seems a bit lack luster.</div></div><hr />

Well I did.<br />
<br />
USD: $39.99 = 28.69€<br />
Euro: 34.99€ = $48.78<br />

I don't care, but I know it won't be long before the storm comes...</div></div><hr />

I live in sweden and I can buy Cataclysm CD/DVD from Webhallen for 259SEK (26,81 €). While if I should buy it through digital download it costs 337,99SEK (34.99€), which is a lot more just to get a digital download instead of the need to go to the store and buy it.<br />
<br />
Same goes for the Gametime cards on the Blizzard Store, I can buy my 2months gamecards at 249SEK (25,78 €) from Webhallen. While if I buy a 2months gametime card from the Blizzard Store it costs me 347,45SEK (EUR 35,97€)</div></div><hr />

It seems to adjust automatically to your time zone based off of a 12:01 am PST release. I live in the Central Time zone so when I goto the site it says 2:01 am.</div></div><hr />

Yeah I was just refreshing the page and noticed that. The 9:01am in the screenshot is probably just because of Bibi's timezone.</div></div><hr />

Or is this the digital version only or is this the time when you can get on the servers regardless of method of purchase? I'm in eastern time, 3 hours ahead and I went to the store at midnight, came home, installed and played. I don't remember the time, so it could have been after 3am, but it seems unlikely. It seems like many non-PST players are gonna be disappointed that after they get their copy they still can't play for hours.</div></div><hr />

You are correct, too bad thousands of people are going to ask about the 9:01 am release time. Bibi should probably have a little note telling people that it will be 12:01 pst.</div></div><hr />

On one hand, I'm glad they're addressing the conflict between the Shield Block ability and Critical Block mastery by letting excess block chance roll over into critical block chance. On the other hand, the associated changes look really discouraging. Upping mastery from 1.25% to 1.5% per point feels insignificant given that Shield Block is no longer going to do what we could always depend on it to do: provide a short window where everything was blocked. 100% to 25% is distressing. Are warriors going to be trying to gear for 75% avoidance+block just so there's that old security? Even 50% would be acceptable because I doubt there would need to be any specific retooling of gear to make Shield Block do what it ought to do - base 50% avoidance+block ought to be easy to hit.<br />
<br />
At least raise the active time of Shield Block if it's getting so viciously nerfed, please.</div></div><hr />

Yeah I do to like box CD/DVDs a lot more than digital purchase, I guess it gives a bit more like &quot;I really own this game&quot;. But tbh it usually depends on what's cheapest, if a digital is cheaper then I usually buy that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You're not going to get a month of added game time for buying a wow expansion, whether you got it via DVD or download. That 'free' month is included with the original game to get you hooked. If you're buying an expansion pack(and the third, no less) there's no need to get you hooked.<br />
Also, Activision-Blizzard has shareholders. Do you have any idea what would happen to their share price if they gave everyone who plays a free month for buying an expansion pack? An expansion pack, I might add, that seems(based on Totalbiscuit's videos and various other sources) to be well worth the asking price and cost a lot of resources to make.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well the expansion costs $40-$80 (and lets be honest, people only buy the CE for the pet :P I know I do) even if they give away a free month thats only $15. They'd still be making profit, and they still have the steady $15*12million subscribers. Not to mention the new content hooking back old and new players alike, which equals more subscriptions in the long run.</div></div><hr />

Paladins already can hit 102% with near no effort (just reforging), what will happen when gear is loaded on mastery? So they will have a 100% chance to take -40% physical damage?<br />
While warriors hit 102% by reforging and regemming avoidance. So we will have a moderate chance of taking -30% and very small chance of taking -60%, increased a little bit every 30 seconds.<br />

No thanks, I think I'll just buy it else whre.Looked on-line before I pre-ordered from Blizzard. It was £25.99-£26.99 everywhere I trust enough to order from. It was £29.99 direct from Blizzard with the guarantee it won't be delayed in the post or anything silly.<br />
<br />
No contest really.</div></div><hr />

What's up with this 9:01 AM shit?<br />

What's up with this not being able to wait when u have waited most of this year? What's up with not getting some sleep before u spend hours n hours trying out Cataclysm? Honestly, people will QQ over anything. And it's not like servers will be stable anyways, better to sleep then pull your hair during the whole night.</div></div><hr />

They sell it at the RRP digitally, if they sell it cheaper than the RRP they screw over retailers even further, causing them to possibly pull in store advertising etc</div></div><hr />

i think the digital price is determined based on a % added to price of the retail copy,which will ensure that there will be customers willing to buy the retail copy,hence there will be profit made for the shops that sell the retail copies.If the digital download was cheaper ,every1 would rush to buy it digitally and no interest would be for the retail versions,which would be bad for companies/merchants involved and in the bottomline for Blizzard.The digital download is a &quot;service&quot; sort of speak,hence the added prices.Now i suspect the european version is more expensive due to fact the european retail version is more expensive</div></div><hr />

<br />
Where's the DK/Druid tank changes? Or are these classes &quot;perfect&quot;<br />
<br />
Let me sum those up for you:<br />
<br />
DKs, please stop whining, you are good right now. In a far better place than warriors or paladins, not as good as druids, but still.<br />
<br />
Druids, holy #$%^ they are OP. These guys could stand in the center of an Hbomb and laugh with impunity, while holding threat on the mother%$#$ing sun. <br />
<br />
Paladins/warriors hi, we nerfed you. Then what we saw on live, and in beta was some of you figured out how to have pretty good mitigation. Yeah, we nerfed that. Grats. Oh and goodluck holding threat with your big threat move, we nerfed the %$(^ out of that. <br />
<br />
You want to complain about them always talking about paladins. You know what, you should dread the day they start talking about dks. That means you are about to get a &quot;change&quot;.</div></div><hr />

This patch, 4.0.1 druids got MAJOR Rage containment problems wich in turn result in a loss of aggro on single target mobs and especially AOE with one AoE effect with a 6 second cooldown.<br />
<br />
not to mention that most of my abilitys costs more rage.<br />
<br />
Ergo, people dont get that a feral tank / Or any tank for that matter need to have like 5-6 seconds to build up a steady headstart... Nerfing the migation is not nice, since we got DODGE.. The other tank classes got atleast 2 ways to migate damage AND more migation abilitys... <br />

Imagine if your main form of mitigation only got rid of 30% of the damage instead of 100%. Oh, and 6 second aoe cd, yeah, paladins wouldn't know what that is like at all. <br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong, I feel for you. They are really getting away from their target. They wanted tanks to feel less squishy, like we were taking steady but low amounts of damage. Yet all of the changes are just making things more like wrath where we are taking more spikes of damage. Lowering our main threat ability by half (for paladins). Is that really cool? Someone pointed out &quot;but yeah, I hit a 100k sotr&quot;, well grats for you. How often are you doing something insane like that though compared to how many times you hit a much, much smaller sotr. Now cut ALL of those in half. <br />
<br />
To be honest paladins are now much better off using a sp weapon, especially seeing as crusader strike weapon damage is getting nerfed. At least with a sp weapon, hotr is a viable single target (most of the damage is armor ignoring), mixed with HW scaling much better with sp. <br />
<br />
You know you might take me saying &quot;oh druid tanks are op and need a nerf&quot; hell no! Tanks as a whole need some buffs tbh. I can understand tanking is supposed to be stressful, it's supposed to be scary, but at what point are you getting rid of fun to make it that way. I play for fun, not for stress. With tanking becoming this way I will just drop it and go ret, or just play my dps classes. Queue times will increase, because let's be honest who really plays wow because they don't have enough stress in their life?</div></div><hr />

I realy liked paladins using sp weapons in BT. They were unique geared tanks. It was fun to balance spell power and warriors defense gear to get paladins unique balance. My prot pally is stuck at 70 level since in WotLK it became warrior's clone :(</div></div><hr />
