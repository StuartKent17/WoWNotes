Azerite-themed enemies<br />

Reduced the number of Resonant Focus orbs created per cast of Resonant Burst to 2 orbs (was 4).<br />
Removed the Knockback component of Resonant Backlash (triggered from Resonant Shield) on Normal and Heroic difficulties.<br />
Reduced the Knockback magnitude of Resonant Focus orbs on Normal and Heroic difficulties.<br />

No changes to stun and interrupt DR? Rip, guess I'll keep enjoying the 30 second cc chain from the dark iron team. I guess that's the same team that is Mag'har Orcs for Alliance, in that case, nerf the DK guy, he has so much self healing MDI candidates would feel jealous.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Even if damage stops the healing, classes that have ways to clear themselves from Dots, or have ways to become imune will still benefit from the full healing. It should be 25% over 4s, and it would still be usefull (not enough to warrant race changes maybe)</div></div><hr />

I would think you can't channel the while ice blocked. Doesn't ice block apply a stun aura to the player while the spell is up?</div></div><hr />

It's basically a Lay on Hands in 4 seconds time but with just a 1.5 minute cooldown.<br />
<br />
If the opposing side has no DoT classes: Just run off, get others to CC them so they can't catch up, hide behind a pillar and heal up. Every 1.5 minute.<br />
<br />
Paladins: Bubble on low health and use it. Only a priest can remove it - but by the time they actually get to it, so much healing has been done already.<br />
Rogues: Cloak of Shadows, Vanish/sprint, get behind pillar, heal up.<br />
Mage: Blink blink, iceblock if dots are there then cancel dots, pop the heal.<br />
And these are just the classes who can get rid of the dots -IF- the enemy team even has any. If not, basically everyone can abuse it. I just feel that if Lay on Hands can't be allowed in Arenas due to how strong it is (At least THAT causes forbearance so you can't use divine shield for a while and has a 7.5 minute cooldown WITH reduction talent), this racial shouldn't really be allowed either.</div></div><hr />

It's the same for me mostly... or well, I don't like the faction conflict arc that much, they always end up the weakest story arcs. But yes, with islands... I love the concept, I don't mind grinding, and yet they are just so boring to repeat (why are they even about beating a timer, to ensure they have to be samey each time for balance?!) and mostly there for the anti-fun &quot;reward&quot; that is azerite...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Are you being facetious? Knockbacks add zero difficulty. They just make the game super annoying. It interrupts casting and makes the game feel super slow for casters. Even for melee it's awful. The spinning/knock-back mobs in Voldun make me hate doing Champions of Azeroth WQs so much that I will actively try to avoid them like I do with Beachhead quests for the Tortollan. <br />
<br />
I for one welcome our non-knockback overlords.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Did some mythic islands yday, we tunneled the mistweaver, she dies, we tunnel the hunter, he dies, the dk doesn't die for several minutes, we try to ignore him and move on, he keeps chasing us half the map, gripping and stunning on cd, so we decide to kill him and have to pop every dps cd we have to burst him down (team was prot warrior, havoc dh and bm hunter). His bonestorm was healing him to full in seconds, to compare player's bonestorm heals 15% of your hp per tick but only if you have 5 enemies on you, from 2 melee on him it should be only be 6%. <br />
<br />
I sure can't self heal on my 380 blood dk as much as this guy does.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Lay on Hands that breaks on damage, 90 second CD, only heals at 1 second increments, requires channeling for 4 seconds, and disallows movement while using. <br />
<br />
Rogue stealths and removes dots<br />
Rogue uses regeneratin<br />
0.8 seconds later - rogue has healed 0% health and CD is reset to 90 seconds<br />
Racial 100% useless<br />
<br />
or <br />
<br />
Rogue stealths and removes dots<br />
Rogue uses regeneratin<br />
1.7 seconds later - rogue has healed 25% health and CD is reset to 90 seconds (around one potion). 1-3 people in arena or 5+ people in BGs/World PvP continue to wail on low-health rogue. <br />
<br />
Dont know what arenas people play where people are undisturbed for 4 seconds at a time when they are under 50% health. You're either ignored/CCed and at full health or you're being hunted by 1 or more people. Often the entire team is focusing fire on you. The channel also doesn't work on movement so good luck getting even one tick. if they guess where you are going, then probably zero. If they don't, that might buy you 1 second with a slight change of 2.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No offense, but what's your higher MMR? It's actually fairly common for this to happen, doesn't happens always but some classes allow this kind of cheesy play.<br />
<br />
In your case (which is a really weak argument because a literal infinite amount of things can happen, so...), a good Rogue will just stealth, and use that behind a pillar. That's it, guess what? Rogue is now at least close to full health and you eat a dick. If it's 1v1, Rogue can also vanish -&gt; sap you and regenerate in front of your face. For Paladins it is a free top after a bubble so long as the shield doesn't get dispelled. Many other classes have some sort of get away button, if we're talking team play your teammates can even help out. It's just a really broken racial overall. <br />
<br />
As a healer, this also saves you mana whether you or someone in your team uses it. The ONLY thing that would diminish this racial is dampening and even still it's not that much of a hit so long as the arena hasn't lasted for 10+ minutes.</div></div><hr />

His bonestorm was healing him to full in seconds, to compare player's bonestorm heals 15% of your hp per tick but only if you have 5 enemies on you, from 2 melee on him it should be only be 6%. <br />
<br />
I sure can't self heal on my 380 blood dk as much as this guy does.<br />
<br />
obviously the guy who liked knockbacks did not play as much islands :D<br />
<br />
Only played melees in BfA and it was super annoying to get pushed back all the time, even with proper mobility. It made islands less enjoyable.<br />
<br />
<br />
There are some wqs mobs with knockbacks, too.....no challenge still very annoying.<br />
<br />
Devs should reduce knockbacks in PvP, too, never saw so many on classes that never had them before.<br />

It's still fucking OP especially for Rogues and other classes that can remove DoTs like paladins, it's essentially a lay on hands lol.<br />
<br />
Who cares. Zandalari Trolls are still going to be 1/8th the amount of players as blood elves<br />

I honestly don't even care how OP it is as long as it makes people play Trolls on the fuckin Horde. So sick of 60% elves.</div></div><hr />

Players who PvP will care. It'd be a bit selfish to just dismiss them.</div></div><hr />

Its a bit selfish to want something nerfed to uselessness because you (not you specifically) cant/wont play a ztroll when there are better racials than a 40k heal on a 90sec cd.</div></div><hr />

Uselessness is a bit of a stretch, I'd say most players just want this racial to be more balanced. 40K HP/90 secs also sounds a bit underwhelming, more like 100% HP/4 secs with a 90 CD.</div></div><hr />

I mean... If you want your opponent to full channel and you choose to not kick/stun/damage at all, then sure they'll get a full heal. But any semi decent player will stop it any of the several ways to do so.<br />
<br />
And if &quot;most&quot; players just want it balanced, where are those players? Cuz they sure as shit aren't on MMOC or the wow forums.</div></div><hr />

You've got to be joking.<br />
<br />
Fight a paladin and you have no priest, worse yet, your priest gets silenced when trying to mass-dispell? That's a Divine Shield AND Lay on Hands in one.<br />
Mages can CC and blink away behind a pillar easily.<br />
Monks can just roll/teleport to safety and pop it.<br />
A rogue can shadowcloak and sprint off to use it.<br />
<br />
Basically: If an arena team would make a build around the Zandalari racial, you can't stop it. You say it's easy to prevent, but honestly it's easy to stop people from preventing it in the first place.</div></div><hr />

This racial should be reduced to the ground in PvP,or else as some have mentioned - it's jump behind the wall in arena and in 4 seconds you are fully healed.</div></div><hr />
