Prepare for two relentless days of Blizzard gaming and fellowship, including in-depth discussion panels with Blizzard developers, hands-on opportunities with the latest Blizzard games, and intense eSports tournaments featuring top pro gamers from across the earthly plane.<br />

Tickets for BlizzCon 2014 will go on sale in two batches, one on Wednesday, May 7 at 7 p.m. PT and the other on Saturday, May 10 at 10 a.m. PT, through the online event ticketing service Eventbrite, priced at $199 each (plus applicable taxes and fees). In addition, a limited number of tickets to an exclusive pre-BlizzCon Benefit Dinner will go on sale Wednesday, May 14 at 7 p.m. PT for $750 apiece (plus applicable taxes and fees; BlizzCon admission included), with proceeds benefitting Children’s Hospital of Orange County (http://www.choc.org/).

It went from 180 to 199.. it's really not a big deal. If you have the money to fly out to Anaheim, the extra $20 isn't going to make or break your trip.</div></div><hr />

That is probably exactly what they will do haha. Then two weeks later they will announce and release open beta....</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is a lot they can talk about, including WoW.<br />
<br />
If they DIDN'T have one, people would bitch like they did when they &quot;skipped&quot; it a few years ago.<br />
<br />
Blizzard can't really win can they? :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Pretty much guaranteed now. I'm guessing they'll premier the full WoD cinematic at Blizzcon. The late start to beta is the other big clue regarding a later launch date than many were expecting.<br />
<br />
Not too sure what else they'll reveal. I'm not sure I'll even bother with a virtual ticket this year.</div></div><hr />

It'll be a two-day pimp event for the Movie. Plus Anniversary Shenanigans.</div></div><hr />

Blizzcon will likely be about heroes of the storm, android hearthstone possibly info on the warcraft movie, a huge starcraft/wow pvp and live raid on WoW.<br />
<br />
Hope for some Project Titan news. (But would not shock me if activation put an end to the project)</div></div><hr />

There is no expansion for SC2 to anounce this year.<br />
There are no SC2,Heartstone, HotS and WoW tournaments.<br />
There is no movie that's in the works.<br />
There are no patches comming up that could be revealed at Blizzcon<br />
There is no other big news they could show<br />
<br />
Yep clearly nothing to show.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Moradim</div><div class="date">2014-04-22, 06:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">still not sure what they will talk about: heroes is a niche title, not something on the scale of say...wow, or diablo. they could show a trailer for the last starcraft expansion, but other than that im not sure what they could discuss, unless there is some new project yet to be revealed.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">enchanted</div><div class="date">2014-04-22, 06:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Also, I hope they remove all the background noise from other areas around Blizzcon in their stream atleast.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dorfadin</div><div class="date">2014-04-22, 06:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well with the announcement of Blizzcon not till November I think its safe to say WoD will come afterwards otherwise they have nothing to talk about at Blizzcon:( so I guess that will mean 1 raid to last us 1 year again, talk about dragging content out to the maximum lol</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Draenox</div><div class="date">2014-04-22, 06:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">They could announce Legacy of the Void, more info, perhaps a trailer, on the WoW movie and info on Heroes of the Storm.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I dont see the point...unless they have something new to show?<br />
<br />
They will be showing off Legacy of the Void, Probably first view on a WoW movie trailer, and good chance a reveal on a new project to name a couple.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xtrm</div><div class="date">2014-04-22, 06:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I assume they'll announce the new StarCraft expansion, maybe another Diablo expansion, Hearthstone expansion two (since Naxx should be out in the summer), and maybe release HotS?

<br />
They don't release products at Blizzcon.. mainly because it would be unfair on the people at the convention who would miss out on launch day participation. Plus HoS is ways off release.. they've not started beta testing it yet.<br />
<br />
Blizzcon is mostly panels, Q&amp;As, e-sports and contests. I'm guessing they'll just talk a lot about WoD and perhaps future features for WoW and the future of the other games too. Throw in a hearthstone expansion perhaps and maybe the next SC2 expansion preview and they might find enough to talk about. Of course it's always possible they've been working on a new product no one knows about yet but I'm guessing with HOTS they'd be too busy to take on another project on top of that. I still live in hope Titan isn't dead.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cptaylor38</div><div class="date">2014-04-22, 06:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So this Blizzcon will have the cinematic reveal for Warlords, some movie clips (if they don't postpone that) and probably a preview at another reality show with Metzen and the cast. I really wouldn't be surprised at this point if they had an entire reality show dedicated to filming them at work.<br />
<br />
Anyway. I don't know why people keep saying Project Titan. Project Titan is dead. The people from Project Titan were pulled to WoW and added to the team so that they could help push out faster content and work on the expansion.<br />
<br />
And judging by that, it's probably safe to assume that Project Titan wouldn't have been released for another 20 years anyway.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'd guess, D3 xpac, HotS, WoW 6.1/6.2 and possibly a feature that isn't going to be ready by WoD launch, and a possible update on the Starcraft side of things?<br />
<br />
They'll probably also do some Hearthstone tournament(s) and maybe, just maybe some HotS?<br />

There's a lot more to blizzcon than just reveals.</div></div><hr />

There is no expansion for SC2 to anounce this year.<br />
There are no SC2,Heartstone, HotS and WoW tournaments.<br />
There is no movie that's in the works.<br />
There are no patches comming up that could be revealed at Blizzcon<br />
There is no other big news they could show<br />
<br />
Yep clearly nothing to show.<br />
<br />
Amen.<br />
<br />
Seriously, there is so much they can talk about, theres likely more people spread across the other games together than WoW's current subs.<br />
<br />
I'm hoping for a D3 xpac announcement and some HoTS and &quot;Titan&quot; info.<br />
<br />
BlizzCON is a convention, not a fucking WoW announcement headquarters, WoD might not even be out then. People don't pay 200 for a WoW announcement, they pay it for the demos, the panels, the Q&amp;A, the tournaments.</div></div><hr />

WOD will not be out before December... and this Blizzcon will be used to create hype for it. Cause there is NOTHING else that Blizzard can do now other than go full out PR mode for 6+ months to safe face. I wonder... if there will be some subscribers left in WOW after other 6 months of nothingness....<br />
<br />
Im starting to hope WoD actually does release after Blizzcon so I can watch the fans give the devs a piece of their minds and hold them accountable for getting the fans all excited last year that they would be playing WoD sooner than they expect (Which would at least be less days than it took for them to get MoP out after they announced it at Blizzcon the same time of year in 2012), and exceeding ICC which they said they would never do again</div></div><hr />

And if it's after, it means.. still a long freaking time to farm SOO.<br />

Lets get real.... fans at Blizzcon will not hold any member of Blizzard dev team accountable for a thing. Blizzard knows that and this is why the are ready to have Blizzcon just before the launch after a whole year of nothing in WOW.<br />

Sure it is.. they've had a few without a WoW expansion reveal. Typically it's every other Blizzcon that they announce a WoW expac.</div></div><hr />

This is INCREDIBLY dissapointing as November 10th 2014+ is WAY to far away for WoWs expansion release. People are already bored and leaving, and its a real problem to have these huge year long or longer gaps between expansions. Meanwhile what is blizzard doing about it? Nothing.. or possibly holding back release to sell blizzcon tickets.</div></div><hr />

If you have the money to fly out to Anaheim, the extra $20 isn't going to make or break your trip.<br />
<br />
INC my opinions that are by no means universal fact.<br />
I live about 20 mins from the convention center. I first went years ago when it was 100$. I went the year after for 120$. Every year since then it seems the price has risen 20$. Every year since then I seem to have less and less disposable income. I had just gotten out of highschool the first time I went and now Im nearing the end of college. I still live at home but I have many school to pay and the house to help. Not only that but the price is now DOUBLE what I initially paid and I would feel like a jerk for going without my GF but I know she cant afford the ticket. Not only that but Ive been 2 times and really, I was always bored by day 2. I can watch streams and read transcripts of the panels (reading is so much faster) that get posted online AS it comes out. So what is there to do? Wait in line for short bursts of playing an unreleased game, (I enjoy this actually), get a goody bag, and maybe meet a person or two from my server that I know if I'm lucky. Oh and buy shit, I could buy shit.<br />
<br />
I guess what I'm saying is for some of us it isnt a jump from 180$ to 200$ its just another skip away from 100$.</div></div><hr />

<br />
where 200 comes out then 220 gets in then 240 and so on...<br />
there nothing special could be...heroes of the storm is coming out near the date... same with WoD...only thing they can give us is a new game and SC2 news and maybe also...oh wait..YES!! THEY WILL ANOUNCE WOW2!!!</div></div><hr />

I watched the new WoW source video and actually felt a little more positive about release considering the way they were talking about players in alpha/beta and feedback as well as testing multiple things at the same time. Then crushed to see this news a little later. Ah to be a WoW player</div></div><hr />

the hints are clear: release was never announced like (release on day X or before). <br />
<br />
Im sure, they will launch WoD on November 8th or 9th, maybe its free for all Blizzcon visitors. back the days they were just normal people as we are. these people like to make other people happy, they will do this. they thank all their success only to the community. they will do this and launch WoD on this weekend as THE big suprise for 10th anniversary!</div></div><hr />

That is just business suicide right there. THey are going to release it Fall this year and then talk about patch 6.1 at Blizzcon. THey know very well that it is in their best interest and in the interest of the stockholders to preserve subscribers. People are already burnt out raiding SoO and another 7-8 months of it just makes me want throw up. THE ONLY thing i can think of is if they come out with Patch 6.0 in the Fall and it brings some new content and a short raid to transition to WoD. THen maybe i can understand a Nov - Dec WoD Launch date. But god, raiders are dropping like fly's right now and 7 - 8 months is going to kill of raiding guilds.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's a nice daydream but they won't do it. They'd never release a WoW expansion while they have a huge convention centre full of WoW players because it would deny those players the chance to log in on Day 1 and start to level up. Raiding guilds in particular would be very upset about that and a lot of players would probably choose logging into Day 1 of an expansion over attending a convention. Plus expansion launches require a lot of support at HQ and launch night events need running too. How would they do that if all their staff are at a convention. So forget any idea of WoD launching at Blizzcon. Oh and the free expansion idea.. Blizz never really give anything for free unless they have to. Harsh maybe.. but true.<br />
<br />
While I hope in my heart that Blizz have a surprise lined up with WoW that they've not announced which they'll drop into the mix at Blizzcon.. my brain tells me they'll show the cinematic and then move on. I just sense they're doing the minimum these days to keep the fans happy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Great point. And now we also know that Blizzard is ready to take time to plan another Blizzcon ... rather than get a new expansion out in time. <br />
<br />
But they really should take some big critics for not even getting the expansion out that was announched at last Blizzcon with the &quot;sooner than you think&quot; comment....</div></div><hr />

I guess Diablo, SC2, and Heroes of the Storm will take to the spotlight. Probably the first major content patch for WoD, too.<br />

Don't be too sure. It depends how quickly they can get WoD out. Siege is already petty much old content, anyways.</div></div><hr />

Lol EXACTLY - Warlords will be out between August and October - I'm thinking September. They don't need Blizzcon (a convention center FULL OF BLIZZARD FANATICS) to promote WoW - plenty of other games, future plans, anniversary, movie, etc etc to talk about. It is a celebration of all things Blizzard, not a weekend full of advertising a WoW expansion.</div></div><hr />

This! I talked with Ion Hazzikostas last year at the Hilton for about 30 minutes about Siege of Orgrimmar and what they want Heroic raids to be. While I was half drunk. I kind of wish I was sober for those 30 minutes. But just those 30 minutes.</div></div><hr />

I mean, we just had one of these, so i hope they are planning something big for one that's not at the end of an X-pac, but i do know people dug up info on another Blizzcon a few days after the 2013 one. Blizzcons are definitely a blast of fun right to the face so whining about it is like complaining about the circus being in town, but If they don't announce something like Project Titan then it'll be interesting to see whats up their sleeve that they didnt tell us about yet. Maybe surprise features for WoD? Whatever it is, ir's obviously something big if it's worthy of a whole Blizzcon. The boys at Blizzard dont hold these things for nothing. (Maybe they'll surprise us again like they did with H-stone. or Perhaps new SC game &amp; Heroes/Hearthstone x-pac info along with WoD stuff)<br />
<br />
Also, INB4 people say that blizzcon is wasting WoD resources, thinking that Blizzard is incapable of multitasking, followed by folks becoming Blizzard's personal accountants saying that they are spending their money/resources on things that don't matter or some other ignorant garbage.<br />

They don't need Blizzcon (a convention center FULL OF BLIZZARD FANATICS) to promote WoW - plenty of other games, future plans, anniversary, movie, etc etc to talk about. It is a celebration of all things Blizzard, not a weekend full of advertising a WoW expansion.<br />
<br />
So ... Blizzard has stated already that WOD will be out &quot;in the fall&quot;.<br />
<br />
To launch the expansion less than month before Blizzcon would be shown as rude cause guilds will still be in the hunt for world fist 1 month after release.<br />

It's not insane by any stretch. You act like you're paying $200 to go watch a powerpoint presentation or something. It's an experience that is unquestionably worthwhile if you aren't a shut-in.<br />
<br />
I've never paid that much to go to a convention, even one that lasted more than 2 days. And most of what you do at BlizzCon IS watch powerpoint presentations....<br />

<br />
This is INCREDIBLY dissapointing as November 10th 2014+ is WAY to far away for WoWs expansion release. People are already bored and leaving, and its a real problem to have these huge year long or longer gaps between expansions. Meanwhile what is blizzard doing about it? Nothing.. or possibly holding back release to sell blizzcon tickets.<br />
<br />
Erm, they have lots of other things they can talk about. If they release WoD after blizz-con it is practically suicide for the game. They need to release it before and they can use the convention to talk about 6.1.<br />
<br />
They can also talk about the WoW movie, Starcraft, Diablo, Heroes of the storm and any new projects.<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
Great point. And now we also know that Blizzard is ready to take time to plan another Blizzcon ... rather than get a new expansion out in time. <br />
<br />
But they really should take some big critics for not even getting the expansion out that was announched at last Blizzcon with the &quot;sooner than you think&quot; comment....<br />
<br />
You do know how large blizzard is? They probably have an entire team dedicated to doing blizz-con.<br />

Blizz-con doesn't revolve around world of warcraft. Who cares if guilds are progressing. Its a game. <br />

I expect a lot of QQ if there's no queue, and overall website instability, people trying to complete the payment process and seeing its sold out or didn't process properly because of the site getting hammered. With the queue, you knew you were guaranteed the ticket or not and didn't have to rush to fill in all your information<br />

I guess it's an &quot;event&quot; ticketing service so they probably prepare themselves somehow. I wonder if EventBrite has done anything of this scale</div></div><hr />

This was my first impression as well. I certainly hope not. I'm hoping they'll show off what the rest of the expansion has in store with 6.1 and beyond (since we'll be a couple months into launch by then please god). And the movie trailer better drop!</div></div><hr />

They would be &quot;making money&quot; if the tickets were 50bucks a piece, but as is the Blizzard custom, they turn everything into a money grab in hopes of cashing in as much as possible before WoW becomes irrelevant to the mass consumer.</div></div><hr />

They already said, they found way to make it work, reworked bones and Titan is once again in full development stage. So there is a good chance, something could be finally to see :)<br />

Except that they said every time they do one it's a net loss. They lose money doing blizzcon even after all the tickets and swag that is sold. but it's worth it because they know the fans have fun. and the devs too.</div></div><hr />

Among many other things, the participants can't be at both locations at once, so it would significantly degrade the quality of the event just to save you some money. If that doesn't bother you then you probably shouldn't worry about going in the first place.</div></div><hr />

Instead of just making up random shit, shall we maybe wait and see?</div></div><hr />

The 10th anniversary is two weeks following this event. If you want to buiild massive hype around this release, this is how you do it, and will ultimately build insane fervor for the release. You get to ask your questions of the devs, they get to lay out all the new toys and such, and every one of you gets your fix.<br />
<br />
We go through this every single expansion, this is just going to be one that lasts a little longer in terms of wait. Nobody's dropping WoW, the one thing that's certain is that whenever they release it, everyone comes back. It's not like this game is going to disappear in the next decade, the addicts in this fellowship won't allow it. They'll just release a few store mounts or pets to tide them over.</div></div><hr />

I've never played straight through and have probably resubbed more than 15-20 times throughout the course of this game. I usually play maybe 2-3 months at most then take a several month break until new content comes out. I should also point out that almost all of my friends are in the same position. <br />
<br />
It is my belief that if blizzard continues to prolong the release of content (such as WOD) that you will not be seeing a huge number of the players that me and my friends represent. This may not necessarily be a bad thing if you can get new players, but I have a feeling that due to the saturation of new games and just the overall number of games being released that it will be difficult. For me and my friends, a release date so far away just doesn't seem very appealing.</div></div><hr />

With a relatively fresh X-pack release, there won't be much WoW or Diablo news to give.</div></div><hr />
