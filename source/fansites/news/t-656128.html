digmouse (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=72673.0) took the time to translate the strategy used by Stars to kill Yogg-Saron with no guardian helping. (Originally posted on ngacn.cc (http://bbs.ngacn.cc/read.php?tid=2529673&amp;fpage=1))<br />
<br />

<br />
Q:Why do people think Yogg-Saron +0 is &quot;No Patch No Down&quot;?<br />
A: Known to all, the hardest thing of this combat is how to deal with Phase 3, so this post will be mainly focused on Phase 3 strategy. According to several posts from EU/US forums, players thought it needs 6 mins and more to kill Yogg-Saron with the help of one Keeper.Take damage tanks took and Shadow Beacon into consideration, we need 4-5 tanks and 5-6 healers, meanwhile the raid dps will be decreased by 10%. This means, regardless of Shadow Beacon, we aren't able to take down Yogg-Saron within enrage timer. That's why almost everyone thought even with full lv239 gears, it's still mission impossible.<br />
<br />
Q:Is it really &quot;No Patch No Down&quot;?<br />
A: We got this world first kill last night, so it's not. Of course there were hotfixes from Blizzard, I'll talk about this later. After we killed Mimiron we did a theorycrafting, we thought with 10 warlocks we could bring down Yogg-Saron in 3 mins and reduce Beacons to 3 or less.<br />
After trying over and over again, familiarity with this combat and improvement of gear helps to increase dps. Most Have-To-Face-Yogg classes managed to double their damage, so finally we got this world first kill without an extreme comp.<br />
<br />
Q: Why do we say affliction warlocks are MVPs?<br />
A: Phase 3 is the most special combat throughout Azeroth, you have to turn back every 11s-19s to avoid Lunatic Gaze so for a normal class maybe you only get 2/3 time to dps. But affliction warlock is a exception.<br />
Another important reason is that, Phase 3 starts at Yogg-Saron with 30%HP left, affliction warlocks with Death Embrace can obviously reduce Phase 3 combat time with 16000-18000 drain soul per tick.<br />
Also in Phase 2, spamming dots makes warlocks much more powerful than other classes. We take 5 warlocks with us, actually this number is less than what we thought to be.<br />
<br />
Another class is rogues with Honor Among Thieves, with 2 pieces of T8 significantly reduce energy cost of Fans of Knives and a damage boost against targets less than 35% health . Our rogues say they could manage 9000-10000 dps, but because of restriction of Phase 2 and interruption of Phase 3, we didn't take Honor Among Thieves rogues.<br />
<br />
Of course, rogues and warlocks are greatly capable of AE, so they could reach a high dps during this combat. Maybe you can see a death knight managed to be NO.1, this can't prove anything, the core of dps deck can only be warlocks and rogues.<br />

<br />
Q: What's the difference among +0,+1,+2,+3,+4 Yogg-Saron?<br />
Strategy:<br />
The first thing people mentioned is Phase 3 adds can’t be killed without Thorim, and every 45 sec there would be a Shadow Beacon(with Mortal Strike that is 375,000 hp during 20 sec and cumulative).<br />
The monsters damage is based on hp, 1% is about 2,000, but 100% is around 35,000. So if they gain hp from Shadow Beacon, they would bring down tanks extremely quickly and say W~I~P~E to us. So how to separate the monsters is the hardest and most important thing.<br />
<br />
Improvement of Gear<br />
Damage decrease by 40%, 20% more damage taken, 20% healing reduction and 20% less HP compared to +4 Yogg-Saron, this brings not only DPS pressure, but also tanking problem. We used to take down Yogg-Saron +3 without Thorim at the middle of June, felt that it's easier than pre-nerf Mimiron, this would tell the improvement of gear is very important to Yogg-Saron +0.<br />
<br />
Soft Enrage<br />
Phase 3 of +0 combat is different from others.Normally we got a 15 mins Enrage timer, but in +0 Phase 3, the 4th Shadow Beacon is almost the limit of raid, this 180 sec soft enrage time may stop many guilds.<br />
<br />
Q&#65306;So what strategy does Stars use in Phase 3?<br />
A&#65306;The strategy we used in Phase 3 was very highly tuned. We can even say, the 3 Tanks, 4 Healers and the 2 Hunters are the key to the encounter, they push a wrong button, we wipe. Maybe there would be a more efficient way to do this but this is exactly the way we win the battle, and we are proud of it. <br />
<br />
First let’s check out the Shadow Beacons. Every 45s after P3 starts, Yogg will place Shadow Beacons on 3-5 random adds (the first wave should be 3, but it will definitely goes to 4 or 5 the second time). The Beacon looks pretty like Hunter’s Mark, and will explode after 10 secs, all enemy creatures within 20yd of the explosion will gain a stackable HoT which heals 750K HP in 20s. So the strategy goes to 2 basic rules: <br />
<br />
1. Keep all 5 beacons 20yd away from each other.<br />
2. Keep all beacons 20yd away from Yogg.<br />
<br />
The general procedure we execute it:<br />
1. Formation: similar to the easy mode, all melee around the boss to deal with adds and interrupt all Siphon Life. The rest of Melee DPS attack Yogg all the time. <br />
Tanks: We use 3 tanks here to take hands on new adds one by one (1 per 10 sec), to make sure all tanks receive nearly same numbers of adds. (Actually this is sooooo hard to achieve, we missed lots of adds).<br />
2. After Yogg apply beacons to the adds, the tanks move as below<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/july/yogg1.jpg<br />
<br />
The first Beacon. This is not hard to handle since there is only 5 adds around and the newly spawned ones will not be marked, so it will definitely be the 1st, 2nd and 3rd adds that spawn to be marked. The tanks will only need to easily move to pos A, B and C, and get back after the Beacon explode, and certain damage dealers burn them to keep tanks safe. <br />
2) The 2nd Beacon. This will happen after 90secs. There should be 10 adds around and 4, 3, 3 on each tank. We still pull them to A, B and C, and Hunters standing at the green spot use Distracting Shot to move all 5 marked adds safely away. However the most difficult point comes, there will be multiple ways the Beacons spread among pos A, B, C:<br />
<br />
Very difficult to handle, mostly a wipe if happen:<br />
(3.1.1)(1.1.3)(0.3.2)(2.3.0)(0.2.3)(3.0.2)(3.2.0)(2.0.3)<br />
Pretty easy to handle, and will happen more likely:<br />
(1.3.1)(2.1.2)(2.2.1)(1.2.2)(1.1.2)(2.1.1)(1.2.1)<br />
<br />
The hunters need to figure out the Beacons fast and choose the right add to DS.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/july/yogg2h.jpg<br />
<br />
The advantages to handle Beacons with Hunters: DS will force the add to follow the Hunter for 6 secs and since the adds move extremely fast, they will move out of 20yd range in 3secs to avoid being effected by the explosion, and the threat will immediately restore after 6secs so the add will go back to the tank to let the damage dealers burn them. Furthermore, Hunters can deal significant damage to the boss itself, even bit with Rogues and locks, so we can get less tanks and more DPS. <br />
<br />
3) The 3rd Beacon happens at 135secs, similar with the 2nd, there will be more adds on the tanks, and it will be more and more difficult. We only managed to deal with 3rd Beacon twice among all our tries, the first, 1.8M left, the 2nd, we kicked his ass.<br />
3. Burning. Some of the damage dealers burn the adds (Rogues and Shadow Priests are best, and a Unholy DK for the 13% spell vulnerablity), for efficiency we AEed them, all of the raid goes burning adds on 3rd Beacon.<br />
<br />
So, the key and most difficult points of the encounter:<br />
1. Tank pulling: The tanks should be extremely concentrated on pulling adds, since they spawn randomly. <br />
2. Tank healers: Newly spawned adds will hit the tank for around 35K, but we use 3 dedicated healers + 1 assisting healer, sometimes you cant fully rely on the healer, instead you need a good communication with the tanks and proper use of CDs.<br />
3. DPS: all damage dealers must make around 5500-7500 to burn him down in 3mins provided you can not face the boss in around 1/3 of this phase. It’s extremely hard even on +1/ <br />
4. Handling with Beacons: the Hunters must choose adds and DS in a perfect rotation, and hope it is not the worst situation like (2.3.0)(0.2.3) or (3.0.2) (after theorycrafting we found that we only get half chance to get a ideal situation), but anyway those are not totally impossible to deal with, we get a (0.3.2) on our kill, and the excellent performance and luck of our DK tank helped him to survive many, many fatal attacks, made him the strongest tank.<br />
<br />
Other little details:<br />
1. Use a Aura Mastery Chain to avoid Deafening Roars, or the Tanks can not hold too long. <br />
2. Use Bloodlust/Heroism at the beginning, burn the boss fast to 20% and start Execution, there will be no time for you to do this any more.<br />
3. Don’t just turn round every time upon casting of Lunatic Gaze, turn yourself after 1 hit to make sure you maximum your DPS uptime at the cost of 4% sanity once. <br />
<br />
Q: The damage meter?<br />
A: The Unholy DK did impressive damage, actually they are really, really powerful in this encounter, and keep 13% spell vulnerability is another great benefit for the raid, however they AEed a lot of 1% adds so they did many wasted damage. The exact main AE class are Rogues and Shadow Priests, their powerful and stable AE are the key to the burning of adds. The most considerable is the damage dealing to Yogg itself, this is the real key to this encounter, and not many raids can achieve this.<br />
<br />
Q: What about the difficulty of this encounter? Is this the best ever?<br />
A: Definitely, this one is harder than any other bosses in the history of WoW, the Sunwell is not even comparable with it. On whether is it the best, I have to say, this encounter is certainly well designed, but a good encounter should not make any class too OP in it, and locks are extremely powerful in this battle, if you get 8 or 10 locks it will goes easier but it’s boring, in my personal opinion, it is less interesting than Mimiron.<br />
<br />
Q: The situation on this kill? Are there any good luck with you?<br />
A: First we got some human resource issue so we only have 5 locks, it’s not a very extreme comp. Second we had 2 members dropped during the fight, one died too early and encountered a very rare (0.3.2) spread Beacons; so I think we have a lot of room on this encounter, also a certain outcome for our practice in months. However we got blessings, our DK tank miraculously survived 4 adds with 2 stacks of HoT.<br />
<br />
Q: Did Yogg +0 get any nerf? Does the nerfs affect the meaning of the kill? <br />
A: Yogg was tuned several times after Ulduar ships:<br />
1. P1 and P3 adds health nerf<br />
2. Sara’s health nerf<br />
3. Death Ray will not affect DCed targets any more. <br />
4. Corruptor Tentacles spawn faster, and Blink/Shadowstep can be used now. <br />
<br />
And this is the most recent change:<br />
5. The hidden protection mechanic of Sanity increased to 40%<br />
<br />
The 1st and 5th changes affect Phase 3, and since the healing mechanic of Beacons and adds’ damage are relative to percentage of HP, so the 1st one exactly increase the difficulty for the tanks to survive at the cost of less DPS pressure, so is not considered as a nerf to +0 (however it’s a good new for +1 raids which choose Thorim). The 5th change is the most recent one, this significantly smooth the sanity situation into Phase 3, definitely increase DPS (we can consider 1% sanity = 1s facing DPS time), if not, some of our raid member will get mind controlled earlier, but this will not greatly change P3, so this kill is certainly worth remembering.</div></div><hr />

Organizing 25 people while taking into account the myriad class combinations, specs, and variables within a small window of opportunity =/= easy. Just as &quot;not interested&quot; =/= easy. I'm sure you feel the same way about other hard modes. No one is asking you to do them. All people are stating is that many hard modes are hard, despite all the PvP diehards stating that the only real difficulty in the game is the pillar-humping mini-game called arena.</div></div><hr />

Its not an impossible encounter. And your logic is just as retarded. How many guilds in the world have heroic firefighter? Wowprogress says 173 (Firefighter (H): 173 (0.32%)). How is the game welfare then if only 173 have done another hard mode?<br />

The game is only welfare because you can't hitch a ride on the coat tails of a good guild and lord your epeen over others.</div></div><hr />

sounds to me like none of that shows the game is welfare easy. And in fact is just the idiots that QQ that think its easy because they can't do it themselves.</div></div><hr />

How is the game welfare then if only 173 have done another hard mode?<br />
<br />
The game is only welfare because you can't hitch a ride on the coat tails of a good guild and lord your epeen over others. <br />
<br />
<br />
Which is pretty much few guilds per server, not a bad ratio. Such achievements requires not only skill, but also that you grinded Ulduar in and out to have gear to survive them.<br />
<br />
Sorry, but I dont consider a game hard only because they added few pain in ass modes to some bosses. Truly stupid logic. Game is more then a boss fight, you know.</div></div><hr />

Even though, I'm sure they sat down and thought about which players to bring but they also thought very carefully about their strat. 25 man gives you room to be flexible with raid comp thus allowing you to bring more of one class if you so choose. 10 man, it is not so much. this is ofc imo. If an angry STARS member came out and stated &quot;WTF?

Algalon is hard mode already, there is no easy version and I believe Y+0 on 10man has been done by a few guilds, just the 25man version was insane</div></div><hr />

Slight adjustment to this. Gratz to Stars for getting the World First but the game is still being aimed at people who simply aren't good at it. To people who raided through TK / SSC / MH / BT (not Sunwell) the bosses on normal are not difficult. They're irritating at times, but never difficult. Hard Modes are a poor excuse for making a boss too easy to begin with just so that people who don't know how to play can say they beat it.<br />
Screw 4 Watchers, I'd rather 0 Watchers was the Only mode to Yogg Saron. Ideally I'd rather they ripped the entire Normal Mode idea out of the game and the raids were always set to Hard Mode. Better to bang your head against a boss for a month and feel you earned the kill than slap it for an hour and watch it fall over.</div></div><hr />

They know this, so they make themselves feel better by downplaying the greater achievements of others. It's pretty old and well known psychology. Jealously is a bitch.<br />
<br />
As for WoW being easy mode, the majority of it is. Leveling, maxing profs, and getting decently geared are all things that require lots of time and 0 skill. But, aside from those things, there are very difficult things to accomplish. Just because you yourself can't accomplish them, for whatever reason, doesn't make them irrelevant, impossible or boring.<br />

Raiders were always the minority pre-WotLK. Serious raiders still are, unfortunately, but I accept it.<br />
<br />
<br />
ya I love a challenge. But spending a month to kill the first boss of a 14 boss instance, no thank you. <br />
I'm not saying every boss should be as hard as Yogg 0, but no boss should be as FL with 0 towers up was. No boss should really have been as easy as XT was without heartbreaker either.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hard modes have there flaws, and if you dont like me fine, but its as close as we can get to having your cake and eating it too. <br />
I have no problem with you, assuming that should've read &quot;if you don't like them fine&quot;?<br />
Nobody should &quot;have their cake and eat it&quot; in anything.<br />
<br />
<br />
The hard modes are challenging, none of them are Muru hard, but they do take practice and good execution. <br />
I still think that having anything other than Hard Mode encounters is a mistake. It'll make a lot of money for Blizzard, or they wouldn't be doing it, but it's still a mistake for the game as a whole.</div></div><hr />

You can say all you want about them having a 200+ decked raiding roster and being able to stack any class they want, but at the end of the day they defied the theorycrafting and beat the impossible. And for that they will go down forever in WoW history.<br />
<br />
That aside, anyone contending that this encounter is not extremely overtuned is in denial. Being forced to stack several specific classes and odd specs in order to even hope to down an encounter when the stars align and give you that perfect spread of luck with beacons even between all camps, is just too much. The fight is grossly unrepeatable, and I very much doubt they'll be able to reliably beat it every week. Blizzard needs to really take a look and fix the encounter as a whole. Not nerf per se, just eliminate the ridiculous luck and class stacking involved.</div></div><hr />

One boss doesnt make the game hard, just like one billioneer doesnt make your country rich.<br />
<br />
That would be totally logical if 0 watcher YS was truly the only hard boss.<br />
<br />
Which it isn't.<br />
<br />
Less than 200 guilds have done Firefighter. Probably fewer have done Algalon. And this is the first kill for YS 0 watchers. And before the strategies came in, Sarth 3drakes was hard, as well. <br />
<br />
You can't say that one boss makes the game hard, but it's completely illogical to say that YS 0 watcher is the only hard boss in the game right now.</div></div><hr />

Hummm 1 type of hardmod is not = content.<br />

So, the statement remains true, the game today is easy. In another time, you would need almost that kind of effort (if not the same) to actually say &quot;we killed boss X!&quot; instead of &quot;We killed boss X + 0 with half raid naked, half mana, non DK tanks...&quot;.<br />
<br />
You do all that to... humm... score an achievement and... humm... a new piece of random gear that it's not that godly and will be shitty soon...<br />
<br />
Not making fun of achievements or hardmodes, but that you need that kind of stuff to just go away from welfare. There is no linear progress on the dificult level. You just go from dumb to a little &quot;dumb check&quot; and all of sudden &quot;omfg tune that impossible shit down, only 1 guild killed it with a OP class mechanic for that encounter alone!&quot;.<br />
<br />
There is no &quot;welfare &gt; easy &gt; normal &gt; hard &gt; nightmare&quot;, just &quot;welfare &gt; easy &gt; nightmare&quot;.<br />
<br />
That's why pvp guys say its easy, they can down the same bosses and miss only a few achievement popups and a few drops that aren't &quot;game breaking&quot;</div></div><hr />

You'd have a point nearing validity if the game has not always been like that. The game is the same difficulty as it was back when it first started. The difference is the bottom of the scale is accessible to more people. It still takes as much skill as it did for the very first raiders to down current bosses.<br />
<br />
Gear and epeen/achievements is the whole point of raiding in the first place, funny how you try to spin that stuff as negative.</div></div><hr />

YS is the only boss which's hard and didnt got nerfed yet.<br />
<br />
And S3D was never hard.<br />
<br />
<br />
If mimiron hardmode isn't hard, why have only 173 guilds downed him? As opposed to the 2611 that have done xt hard mode? Or the 18000+ that have done the seige of ulduar (normal)? That fact is yogg+0 is not the only hard encounter in WoW. No amount of closing your eyes and acting oblivious will change that.<br />
<br />
WoW is hard, just it is easy. Just as all games should be. The reason why wow is so succesful is because it was a pretty decent blend of both. I doubt you've even done fire fighter hard mode yet complain its easy but I could be wrong you could be a troll thats done it for once.<br />
<br />
Oh and by the way if you read the article about how they killed yogg they clearly state he was nerfed. Get your facts in your QQ straight at least. Every boss has been nerfed in some fashion, even the sacred &quot;zomg hard&quot; bosses of old recieved nerfs.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cronnix</div><div class="date">2009-07-08, 05:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That would be totally logical if 0 watcher YS was truly the only hard boss.<br />
<br />
Which it isn't.<br />
<br />
Less than 200 guilds have done Firefighter. Probably fewer have done Algalon. And this is the first kill for YS 0 watchers. And before the strategies came in, Sarth 3drakes was hard, as well. <br />
<br />
You can't say that one boss makes the game hard, but it's completely illogical to say that YS 0 watcher is the only hard boss in the game right now. <br />
<br />
<br />
Yeah.. lets see.. Game is built up of PvE, PvP, and social (Aka crafting and so on)<br />
<br />
PvE is 33%. There are about.. 100 bosses in wow mby? so 3% of 100 bosses are hard. So about 1% of the game is hard.. yeah, that 1% totally makes it up for rest 99% welfare.</div></div><hr />

So... you complain WoW is catered too much to casuals, and then declare you're all &quot;moving on&quot; to a game where the most difficult raid boss is the equivalent of Patchwerk and PvP is a dumbed-down version of WoW with no talent trees and woo flying around in the game's Z-axis?<br />

Sorry, but I dont consider a game hard only because they added few pain in ass modes to some bosses. Truly stupid logic. <br />
<br />
<br />
Unlike a Single player game, where you can choose diff mode (easy/medium/hard/etc) at start, mmo doesn't have such option right now (3.2 ftw). So instead for playing hard difficulty you have to activate it on boss. For most people your complaints look like you are complaining that easy mode is to easy. So it looks ridiculous. It's meant to be easy. For those who just want to watch nice pictures and learn some lore.<br />
<br />
<br />
Game is more then a boss fight, you know.<br />
<br />
So, what else is pve game? Hard lore? Want to see some of (no, really, give me some hard lore ;D). Or do you mean pvp? Imo, pvp have hard mode atm. Being on top of arena in 3*3, 5*5 is the one ;)<br />
<br />
Ps. Let me say that Yog +0 not really hard but insane mode ;) Yet only 1 boss on insane mode may look not enough for some people (altho some of those people haven't completed game even on hard difficulty).</div></div><hr />

Want a hard game where you can spend months running around for rare reagents only to have the item you're crafting explode and waste your effort?<br />
<br />
Want a game where dying means you lose experience? Or your enemies can loot your corpse and take all of your items?<br />
<br />
If you actually want these things, there are plenty of games that provide that experience. EVE Online is probably the game of choice if you enjoy paying for the privilege of having other people curbstomp you all day.<br />
<br />
As it happens most people do not enjoy these things. WoW was pretty much the friendliest MMO experience on the market when it came out, and it quickly snapped all the frustrated customers away from other franchises while inviting new players into the game. Easy questing, pain-free crafting, no death penalties. Blizz's biggest mistake at that time was that they figured that when you hit 60, you could wrangle together 39 friends to go play in the nice raid dungeons they'd put together. Most didn't, not because it was difficult (I defy anyone to say Molten Core was hard), but because 40 is kind of a big number.<br />
<br />
I can't help but suspect it's not difficulty people want but exclusivity.</div></div><hr />

<br />
PvP/PvE in Aion is superior to WoW in every aspect.<br />
<br />
<br />
Go YouTube any Aion raid. Go on, I'll wait. Every single one is a tank and spank. The PvP involves no CC and there is absolutely no class diversity since there are no talent trees whatsoever. Every player of one class is exactly the same as every other player in that class. The PvP equates to you both mindlessly smashing your damage keys until one of you dies, or just flies away at any damn point you choose. Flying mounts were the death of WoW's world PvP, why do you think giving everyone the ability to fly at every moment in time will be an improvement on this? Melee classes can be kited ad infinitum. Fortress battles are worse than Warhammer, you're all just smashing at a gate for a few minutes. Healing is bland and uninteresting. Do I really need to continue?</div></div><hr />

How can socializing be hard? I suppose you could what key opens a chat window and make it so the game client screws up your keyboard so what you actually hit isn't what appears on the screen.

Sorry to disappoint you, but I'm afraid you are.<br />
I played Lineage 2 a lot, two whole years actually. I also know that every beta-playing player (whereas I still know a few of them) says that Aion fights and Raids are pretty much the same as for mechanics and stuff.<br />
<br />
And tbh, Lineage 2 really just was &quot;tank and spank&quot; or in PvP: &quot;He who bursts out the fastest, wins.&quot;</div></div><hr />

Im way into both raid progression and 2k+ arena play, Id say arena takes alot more skill because after ive done a boss a few times its a simple rinse repeat from there, and every arena match is crazy unpredictable. Then we run into a fight like yogg +0 where it takes crazy planning, theorycrafting, and hardcore practice + no one getti9ng carried, everyone has to be good to get it done, and it brings back my respect for the raid side of things in a big way.</div></div><hr />

Combat style. Well, for some classes it's really hit and run right now. Altho Blizzards tries to make up (even pallies in 3.2 will have choise: cast instant exorcism or flash light ;D). And even so, for pvp and pve you can't just stand and push buttons. So for most of WoW players it is hard (how many times in pugs RL have to say:&quot;STAY OUT OF THE GREEN CLOUD GOD DAMN IT &gt;_&lt;&quot;).<br />
Crafting: Yes, it may be epic and hard (remember AQ40 opening, basicaly- we was crafting a mace to ring the gong). I'd like if blizzards would implement some non-must-have items equal to hard modes gear.<br />
Grinding: No, not realy. Never was part of pve. Just a filler to kill more of your time.<br />
Socializing: As pvp, depends on player. For some there is an perma hard mode ;) Or you suggesting hard mode chat? To type a word you should solve a riddle? Would be fun, imo.<br />
Smart bosses: Wish myself. Altho paranoid that when first one appers it will break out of the game and destroy the humanity that kills him week per week for years=p</div></div><hr />

<br />
So you're comparing L2 Raids to WoW 5-Man Dungeons? I Lol'd.<br />
You'd have to at least agree on comparing the same categories here, otherwise this whole debate wouldn't make sense at all.<br />
<br />
But still, to give an example: Darkmaster Gandling was not really something I'd call tank and spank. And that's one of the oldest WoW 5-Man dungeon encounters.<br />
<br />
Additionally, comparing the very first WoW patches to L2, a game which was, at that time, much older than even the first thoughts Blizzard had on creating an MMORPG, developed by a far more experienced company (concerning MMORPGs) at that time, is pretty stupid imho.<br />
<br />
Molten Core, Ahn'Qiraj (especially C'Thun), old Naxx etc. were and are all good examples that WoW Raids were and are generally not tank and spank.<br />
<br />
BTW: You complain about today's WoW raidbosses to be tank and spank, and in the same train of thoughts you talk about not wasting your time for &quot;every little achievement&quot;?<br />
Achievements are just collateral damage of accomplished hardmodes. Nothing more.<br />
The real cheese is to get the hardmode items and to be able to say that you actually &quot;did&quot; it, while a huge mass of others didn't.<br />
<br />
So, complaining about WoW being too simple and refusing to try hardmodes just because you, allegedly, don't need the achievements... don't you find that a little hypocritical?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
If you want to use that retarded logic everything in the game is spank, with or without tanking, because you know...you have to do dps to kill a boss.<br />
<br />
I'm going to assume the last boss in Oculus falls into &quot;spank without tanking&quot; as well.<br />
<br />
When shade of aran fireballs a healer, I assume thats tank and spanking too, after all, the healer is taking a hit...like a tank!<br />

<br />
Drains the soul of the target, causing 710 Shadow damage over 15 sec. If the target is at or below 25% health, Drain Soul causes four times the normal damage. If the target dies while being drained, and yields experience or honor, the caster gains a Soul Shard. Each time the Drain Soul damages the target, it also has a chance to generate a Soul Shard. Soul Shards are required for other spells. 4 times the normal dmg=15k around that</div></div><hr />

What achievements? The Realm first Malygos and Naxx thingies? Because everything else I see in there is a huge buttload of useless crap since it doesn't prove anything about you being a hardcore classic gamer or similar... even the &quot;Stone Guard&quot; feat of strength doesn't prove anything.

<br />
There are several ways to make an encounter hard. One of these is to require players to know their class, and how to react to different situations to save themselves and their companions. Another is to have special mechanics and abilities, that require players to learn how to react to these abilities within the context of the fight.<br />
<br />
The first worked in early WoW because specialization was low, so players could use all the options available to their class. In current WoW, specialization is high, so players have a very limited number of options with regards to which of the traditional roles they are playing in the fight and which abilities or rotations to use to maximize their effectiveness in that role. This means the only way to introduce complexity is to give bosses special abilities to make each fight unique with how players must react in different situations.<br />
<br />
The only reason a 5-man boss was trivial in early WoW was because you outgeared, outleveled, or outnumbered the boss. Even then, you could always introduce additional difficulty by PUG'ing with players new to the instance or the game, where you would need social skills to encourage the correct tactics.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
As for scripting.. You know, such things as random attacks, smarter acting like attacking healers time to time... Or that boss actually says something else then &quot;Omg who are you&quot;, after seeing same raid for 20th time.<br />
Blizzard could have done this in WotLK. The predictable threat model is one of the central reasons for the raid specialization in endgame and min/maxing. However, players did not demonstrate interest in such a situation; most players are content with spamming their single-button attack as long as it gets them loot; and so Blizzard did revise their approach toward raid content in this way. What you refer to is not difficulty. It is your own concept of fun, and one that many players in WoW do not seem to be interested in.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Moving away from time to time is not the same as tank and spank. You are changing the rules everytime someone points out where you are wrong. The same script over and over again happens in any game when you run the same instance over and over again. It is no different anywhere else <br />
<br />
<br />
I never said they should? Learn to read. I just said it was cool, to counter the guys post that a game with human controlled bosses would have little player base.<br />
<br />
<br />
That was me that made that, and this was in repsonse to your counter. So how about you stop dodging and answer, oh wait you don't have an answer. If a game had human controlled bosses instead of script controlled bosses it couldn't support a that many instances being runned 24/7.<br />

Sorry, but I dont consider a game hard only because they added few pain in ass modes to some bosses. Truly stupid logic. Game is more then a boss fight, you know.<br />
<br />
<br />
Actually, raiding is all about the boss fights if you haven't noticed. No one runs raids only to kill trash and for the most part trash are just there as skill(lol) or time obstacles.<br />
<br />
Really what is your QQ? You QQ about having to grind Ulduar for gear to survive the hard mode achievements yet that same grind was required in Vanilla only worse. Then you go on to say that the game isn't hard.<br />

Get this through you head. (Doubt you will though, seems intelligent ideas cannot penetrate your skull.)<br />
<br />
WoW is not designed for the highest tier raiders. Majority of the game is designed for mid to low tier raiders, casuals, and PvP'ers. The hard modes you don't care about, are designed for the highest tier of raiding. If you don't care about it, why are you still playing? Posting on a fan site?

If an angry STARS member came out and stated &quot;WTF?

<br />
<br />
So what you expect people to only run only 3 times? Because that is the only way you can say that a script won't be run over and over. Having a few scripts to choose from for only means you have more things to do over and over again. Look at Violet Hold. It has a few random bosses to choose from but if you run it enough times its just the same script over and over again. Yet you claim having 3 slightly different scripts wouldn't be the same script over and over again.<br />
<br />
<br />

How do you counter favortism? How do you counter skill of humans controlling it, making the same boss easy one time, hard the next? How do you counter lack of people to control a boss for the 100th time? If you are getting tired of wow stuff being repeated you would get tired of control a boss the same amount.

Im not gonna share my ideas to you, but I never said about taking out healers, just damaging them. Neither did I mention anything about it being same boss over and over. This system wont work for WoW in current shape, and neither did I say they should use it, I just mentioned its cool to have some bosses under human control, so I dont see why do I even have to elaborate it in first place :/<br />

<br />
Anyways, I wont explain more to you, its just theory crafting done in 5 mins, if you pay me as blizz do to their game designers, I promise I can give you a good system basing on human control :)<br />
<br />
<br />
If you were controlling a boss, why would you just damage the healers and not take them out? Its only common sense. How wouldn't it be the same boss over and over again. Not only do you want human controlled bosses but you want the designers to create a new boss every instance? Because that is the only way it will not be the same boss over and over again.<br />
<br />
Eventually both players and the human controller will be faced with doing the same Boss for the Xth time and it will get boring. That is what happens anytime something is done for a prolonged period of time, things get old.<br />
<br />
No I don't think you could give a good system. You could give one that you find fun, but from your responses here you have no idea of actually designing a game for players.<br />
<br />
<br />
This system wont work for WoW in current shape, and neither did I say they should use it, I just mentioned its cool to have some bosses under human control, so I dont see why do I even have to elaborate it in first place <br />
<br />
Its called discussion. If you don't want something discussed then don't post it, and just say it in front of a mirror. You used it as points to counter things being discussed in this thread and when it was pointed out to you that it isn't fixing the things you want you play the &quot;i'm not going to explain myself&quot; act.</div></div><hr />

Jesus christ human, stop putting words in my mouth. I dont want designers do a shit, I just said it would be fun to have some human controlled bosses in first place, as they did some times on PTR, what is your problem with that.<br />
<br />
Use your brain how to not make it same boss over and over, and a tip: THINK OUTSIDE WOW. Just google Mortal online, and you will see how you can do it.. Geez.<br />

hmm no wait.. you might have a point... this game isnt hard guys.... typing my login name and password is too easy, and thats all i want to do!.. wow this game is SO EASY.. i can log in! now i can claim the game is too easy because all i want to do is easy... i wish they made it so logging in was hard! then maybe i will play more! frig, you can SOLO log in... so easy.<br />

cool, but ultimately would not work when players care too much about the results. Current MMOs are based around long-term progress, which usually means loot, which means difficulty changing randomly or any chance of cheating is not accepted by players.<br />
<br />
...the main reason it sounds cool to have a human-controlled boss is that it would seem to make a victory against them more respectable, and would build team cohesion. This is due to a perception that the controller of the boss would be trying to make it fun. However this is already possible in the PvP that already exists in games; the reason PvP is sometimes not fun is because people are not trying to make it so. A player-controlled boss would have the same problems, with GMs abusing the boss's power to squash the raid. I can't imagine you've had any experiences like this, because all 'GM events' in games are designed to be fun, not to be competitive and have the boss challenge the players. It would not always happen, but it would sometimes especially based on the 'strategy'/repeated wipes model of WoW prior to being able to beat an encounter. The best solution for having fun in a game is for everyone to want that to happen, and that is more complicated that putting boss control in human hands.<br />
<br />
What you want is already possible in PvP. The whole issue of healers being targeted is just because of the current overspecialization in WoW, and because current class abilities do not deal well with squishy players being attacked by an unstoppable and unstunnable giant dragon. Healers could survive against a human-controlled boss with the right game mechanics, but that is not the point.</div></div><hr />

Well man, what I were saying is that the game as the whole isnt hard, only because 3 encounters are. Not any other way around. As it been pointed out above, one rich guy doesnt make whole country rich.<br />

I'm not putting words in your mouth. I never said you want blizzard to create this. I'm saying your idea of human controlled bosses in a game wouldn't work and listing the reasons why I don't think it would work. Never once have I claimed you said something you didn't.<br />

Use my brain like you are? Nothing you have suggested in this thread stops it from being the same thing over and over again. All you've done is expand it from A over and over again with the same instance to A or B over and over again.<br />

Are you even reading what you respond with? You just said that I should use my brain to not make it the same thing over and over again. So were you not using human controlled bosses as a suggestion to make it not the same stuff over and over again? I never said you said they should do it, so the only one here nerding is you. Get over the fact that not everyone will agree with an idea, nor that your idea's are the best thing since sliced bread.<br />
<br />
And you did say how they should make things not be the same over and over again, so stop lying.<br />

A game being hard is not defined by your experience. All video games have varying difficulty settings. WoW started out with 1, and now blizzard is adding more.<br />
<br />
Guitar hero would not be a great game if all the songs only came in Hard mode. Can you claim the game is easy, because it has an easy mode while ignoring the hard mode?<br />
<br />
You can say Super mario bro's is easy. You can make it harder by completing it with no deaths, its still the same game, but that game doesnt reward you if you dont die. WoW does. <br />
<br />
I dont know why you can't see that wow has different settings... You cant claim guitar hero is easy just because you can't be bothered to finish it on Hard mode.... and you can't do that with wow either.</div></div><hr />

You are right there, however what I said was that I wish other aspects of wow then just boss fights were harder. To bad crafting/combat system/PvP/factions doesnt have hard mode :)<br />

The reason that the listed combinations of shadow beacons are difficult is that it makes it impossible for the two hunters to pull enough beacons to reduce the number to one beacon per group. One beacon per group the dps is able to deal with, to burn their HP down so they are not doing much damage. If there are two beacons in a group, the HoT will stack and the mobs' HPs will go too high and the tank will take too much damage.<br />
<br />
If it is (1,3,1) both hunters can pull from the middle group, leaving one beacon in each group. If it is (3,1,1) the rightmost hunter is too far away to pull a beacon, so the first group is left with two beacons after the pull leading to stacked HoTs from the beacons.</div></div><hr />

People don't brag when they complete Guitar Hero in easy mode. People do brag when they complete Ulduar on easy mode, because they then say that the hard modes are not important.<br />
<br />
This was Blizzard's way of making content accessible to everyone, so people could progress instead of banging their heads against guild-killer encounters. There are other possible ways of doing it that wouldn't have bosses killable in easy-mode on the first try, but this is the one they chose. It is understandable that people who care about WoW's raid game would be upset by that, but Blizzard isn't smart enough to know how to make everyone happy. Can either accept that or quit (like many others)</div></div><hr />

If I run that instance 100 times i'll still be facing 3 of the 10 available abilities over and over again. Just like VH is the same thing over and over again, even though it has multiple bosses to pick from, picking 3 of 10 abilities is still th e same thing over and over.<br />

-aka YOU mention it first.<br />
<br />
I said: &quot;I seen it on PTR, it been fun, why would such game have low pop&quot; <br />
-(I didnt say they should use it on all bosses, I just asked WHY WOULD GAME HAVE LOW POP)<br />
<br />
You said: &quot;And how do you propose a Game Company afford to pay and hire a person to be the boss for each and every instance run 24 hours a day, 7 days a week for 11 million subscribers.&quot; <br />

So you want a Turing machine.

You want Blizz to make ground breaking advances in AI that are currently many decades away, if they are even possible at all, so that .... you can have a better raid boss. That is what you want.

People talking about respecting a guild and other crap based on what they have done in a game is really just stupid. Cool they did the hard mode pixel boss that no one else has done. They added new pixels to their characters. Awesome. In the grand scope of things, in another year when a new expansion is out, no one will care. It's just a game. If you really respect someone for being good at a game, you have issues. Respect someone who has actually done something in the world.<br />
<br />
Also to the people saying, &quot;Yeah WoW is so easy.&quot; It is. Three hard fights in an expansion don't make the whole game hard. Yeah, I've never done Alagon and Yogg with 0 keepers, but I've done Mimiron on hard mode and it's far from hard. Anything that actually was hard has been nerfed to make it easier. Yogg, Mimirion, I'm not sure if Alagon got nerfed yet, but he probably will. This game is geared for the masses that usually fail. I played in pre-BC and the worst thing that has normally happened would just be a retarded Hunter. Now days when I invite anyone to a PuG there is a good chance they will just fail at their class.<br />
<br />
Point being, this game is getting dumb down for the kids who can't figure out how to play. I myself have moved on and am waiting for Aion to come out. <br />

Go read my posts again. I said it could be cool with some more variation in boss scripts, not a self learning human killing machine. Thats all. And yes, it could be nice for bosses having 3 random yells they yell at beginning. Nothing of that is impossible.<br />
<br />
Way to misjudge my posts, smartass :)<br />
<br />
God, even in such games as TCoS and Darkfall (Which failed big time and should still be in beta, I know and I agree) the AI of normal mobs is more advanced then wows raid bosses. Go check some other games then wow before you go with &quot;That technology is far away&quot;.<br />
<br />
Just to prove you wrong, even MGT Priest boss adds act smarter then rest of bosses, and actually react on what player is doing/casting. See, so much for &quot;far away technology&quot;.<br />
<br />
But well, its just me thinking it could be cool with more bosses who react on what is going on around them, I guess.</div></div><hr />

Ahh so once again i'm to blame for you failing to say what you wanted. Grow up and admit your mistakes. I didn't use game instead of gaming company, it is just you can not follow context and the discussion and assumed wrong. My use of game wasn't inccorect because the company couldn't supply the amount need for the game, hence the game can't support it. Logic isn't your strong suit.<br />

<br />
Your summary is out of order and arranged to have your replies be in an order that makes you look better. I never said you said it would fix wow, nor that they should do it. You are adding things to what I said. What I did say is that it wouldn't fix something be repeative to have human controlled bosses in instances. <br />
<br />
I never asked you how they could do it. I know how they could do it, which is why I know it to be a bad idea that wouldn't work in a game with a large player base which is what I originally mentioned. Note how that no where asks you how it can be done. You wanted smarter bosses that aren't scripted so it won't be the same thing over and over again. I mentioned that is only possible with human controlled bosses and you ran with that. Its how discussions evolve. But it turned out you had nothing good to say about the issue so now you are relegated to twisting facts to save face.<br />
<br />
<br />
So stop trolling and go argue with your own ideas. Have fun.<br />

I'm not trolling, i'm trying to discuss. If anyone here is trolling it has been you and synchmaster2.</div></div><hr />

Look not only at this achievement, but their past exploits as well. Consider also that the EU/USA had more then a week's head start over China when Ulduar hit. Stars has remained largely unknown, choosing not to put themselves in everyones face and exploit themselves and their talents for a few measly bucks. <br />
<br />
What makes stars truly great however, is their humility and willingness to share and remain humble. It's an honorable thing to make light of your heard-earned work (strategies) and give them to your peers (the WoW community). Stars have done this, and that is noble indeed.<br />
<br />
European mega-guilds should learn from Stars that there's more to life then flashy techno-embedded victory extravaganzas...<br />

I said it could be cool with some more variation in boss scripts, not a self learning human killing machine. Thats all. And yes, it could be nice for bosses having 3 random yells they yell at beginning. Nothing of that is impossible.<br />
<br />
<br />
Cool for the first 5 times you run the instance. The once you've seen all the random messages possible for the 100th time it is the same old crap. So no you wouldn't be changing anything. You aren't creating any variation in bosses that hasn't any been done and isn't already in the game.<br />
<br />
The problem you fail to recongize is that anything that is scripted become old. You are complaining that things are old and the same after running something for a while. Essentially you are a for the moment player. When you or synchmaster2 play aion for a year+ and another game is coming out I can bet the same arguments will be used as to why aion sucks and this new game is better.<br />
<br />
There is nothing you can do to counter scripted things being the same thing experinced other then having human controlled bosses. And that means no selecting 3 of 10 scripts to use, 3 of 10 abilities to use, no just damaging healers instead of removing them right away. It means actual human controlled boss that is as random as pvp against another human player. And that would never work in a game with a large player base for instances.<br />
<br />
Instances will always get boring after you run them so many times. That doesn't mean a game sucks, is easy or anything. It just means you've been playing a game for a while and if you find things boring at that point. Leave. Its that simple. Yet you are still playing, and still caring enough about the game to post here on one of that games fansites.<br />

The fact is you discussed the idea and suggested several ways why human controlled bosses would lessen the repetitive nature of running content. You taking only your responses to a few of the things and claiming all my comments were responding to only those responses.<br />
<br />
Read your own post history and you will see this discussion is much more then you asking about why only low population would work for an instance boss to be human controlled. Which has nothing to do with you stating you've seen in on the ptr since that came both later and isn't relevant to the discussion since it was about content being boring after being run for the 100th time.</div></div><hr />

Nice dodge. Once again, go prove your statement about me arranging my summary to make my posts make sense. <br />

And actually no, you started to discuss it, I however asked why would games with human controlled bosses have low population, not how would they manage it:<br />
<br />
<br />
And why would game with human controlled bosses have little player base? Each time I seen Gm controlling a boss, it was epic fight, Id love such a game where bosses act smart.<br />
Your answer:<br />
<br />
And how do you propose a Game Company afford to pay and hire a person to be the boss for each and every instance run 24 hours a day, 7 days a week for 11 million subscribers. <br />
<br />
I never said anything about human control, just pretending to act smart. Go check out spellborn, mobs there act pretty natural.</div></div><hr />

<br />
First, pull this tactic out of your head is already crazy.<br />
Second, execute it perfectly is NUTS.<br />
Third, Noticeable knowledge from leaders about all classes (E.g: Rogues going HAT mainly because of group performance in single target but still adding to that FoK with other rogues in group is just insane crit amounts per sec)<br />
Forth, what the Stars guy said... 16k-18k damage from Drain Soul ticks is not fun neither for warlocks nor for other classes -_-.<br />
<br />
Hardest fight until now. And after this victory from Stars I must say Hard Modes were a great tool used by Blizz. People can make encounters easy or REALLY HARD. Ulduar is the best raid ever made in my opinion.<br />

What the hell do you think GM controlled means? That is saying something about human control, not just pretending to act smart. And the only way something can pretend to act smart the way you want is by human control. Just because you add 2 more possibilities does not mean its no longer act from a dumb script.<br />
<br />
Because the boss suddenly yells something different when you've faced him for the 20th time doesn't it is any different then if he yelled the same thing. It is still from a script, acting &quot;dumb&quot; to use your terms.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If WoW were real, bosses would realize they have been killed 5000 times before and would try to negotiate or run away instead of fighting. People get sicking of killing the same boss, it doesn't matter if they have new abilities. But WoW requires bosses to be the same and to continue to be killed so they can drop loot. This was obvious a few months after TBC, when the first round of item buffs happened because people complained that they would quit unless raiding was both challenging and dropped good loot. If you want a different game, WoW is not going to change.<br />
<br />
I doubt Aion will be what you're looking for either.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This is so impressive, but I don't understand how this can be considered even remotely fun. Why on earth anyone would go through this incredible amount of work for a single fight in a video game is far beyond me. But again, the theorycrafting and execution is unbelievable.<br />
Why play WoW at all? The reasons are the same. Asian cultures are just more used to things which require group effort, instead of solo content, so they can continue to have fun if their effort helps them achieve their goal.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Again, for the dumb people in the back of the class. You (a human) will always be able to tell that a boss (a script) is fake. No computer controlled mob will ever &quot;pretend to act smart&quot; in a convincing way, because computer AI is no where close to that, and may never be. No random yells, no &quot;smarter&quot; AI, nothing will ever change that.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
And no, only because its from script, doesn't means it gotta act dumb. You can script mobs to react in a way which looks good enough to look real, as in many single games, and which comes in few new MMOs.<br />
<br />
<br />
No. Because it's from a script means that it can't ever have even close to human &quot;intelligence&quot;. The reason it &quot;good enough to look real&quot; in single player games is that you play those games a couple of times. Play any single player game 20 times and tell me how &quot;good enough&quot; the AI seems. It won't. You will be able to predict the AIs moves far in advance, in any single player game, the 20th time you have seen it.<br />
<br />
Well. I will. You I am not so sure about any more.</div></div><hr />

So do I, after I played Beta, it looked like a wow Clone, with just more fun PvP. Same quests, same combat, even thou I found graphic and small effects more pleasant then WoWs, but no wonder, WoW is quite old now.. <br />
<br />
However I got my hopes up on Mortal Online. It's soon done, and to judge by material released so far, they aim to create a game where you can explore the world and its PvP opportunities.<br />
<br />
Bosses in MO are one time only, and anyone can access em at same time, no instances. Once boss is dead, it is dead for ever, and its just wait short time till new appears. Game focus more on exploring, PvP and socializing (There are no hordes / alliances, so think before acting), rather then PvE combat.<br />
<br />
----<br />
<br />
And as for jontaxe, dude, cba arguing if you dont see my point. I didnt say AI should act so smart that you could not tell difference, I mean that it should act smart enough to not make you bored, as every single trash mob in WoW do. Sure after 1000th time you can predict most outcome even with smartest mbos, but its better then just same &quot;Charge towards player and die&quot; over and over.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesebrezen</div><div class="date">2009-07-08, 10:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think Stars shows the difference between the Asian and Western Meaning of MMO:<br />
<br />
Western: I've the biggest Epeen, the rest sucks. If someones better flame him to make my Epeen bigger<br />
<br />
Asian: We play together, we share our achievements, we have fun together, even if it's solely grinding (as in most asian mmo's). (Well, let's not count that one guy who killed his friend for stealing an item on a MMO)<br />
<br />
I'm happy that Starts got the 1st World Kill on that both, and neither EU or Us, since that would've just been a fight over epeen once again. <br />
You even the some hatred against Stars with their 250+ member in guild.<br />
But thats just the result of their understanding of an MMO. After all they play together and have fun together, so they don't just need their group of elitist around them, but care of the rest of the community on their server.<br />
<br />
<br />
So Short: Congratulations Stars and thanks for sharing the tactic.</div></div><hr />

Pointless discussion btw, difficulty is a personal thing. Hard for you doesn't make it hard for everyone. Easy for you doesn't make it easy for everyone.

that is how you beat a fight with your brain. I remember reading an interview a while back, some guy who left nihilum (is that how it's spelt?) for sk-gaming and he said the philosophy in nihilum was to just brute force everything until they beat it and I think it's pretty cool that this boss required all these intricate strats and a certain raid stack.<br />
<br />
still though, this fight goes against everything blizzard claims they want raiding to be, although I suppose this is the hardest of the hard modes so it has to be a bit silly.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Before Ulduar was coming out and we had finished Naxx months back, just waiting for something challenging they decide to make a whole instance normal, while you can chose to do em again on hardmode. The same encounter, just that theres a few changes to it. I know I play wow mostly because of raiding, the fun side of it. Not just to get some pixels. And what I find most fun is awesome encounters, that are hard and you spend a long time wiping on. And when you finally down it, the awesome feeling you get is hard to describe. I dont feel the same way about these new hardmodes, some of the encounters were ok on normal, they werent really hard, more like borderline easy. And then when you've done these easy fights, you can chose to do em again, but harder! It may just be me, but I dont see the fun in that. At all.<br />
<br />
And no, I'm not saying that Blizzard should change the game just for me, I'm saying that I see where those people are coming from. And I also know a lot of other people who think like this. But sadly, the majority of WoW players are infact the ones that think ulduar normal is hard.<br />

You're wrong on so many levels.<br />
<br />
I did do the original ulduar on both the ptr and parts of ulduar on live before it got nerfed, and nope, wasnt that hard. But I agree, it was fun without tactics and all. But that was only on the ptr, since you had all the strategies from scratch when it went live (except a few). So sir, I believe you're a failure.<br />

There was a guild named Stars on the Tunare server in EQ. My guild Pia Fidelis raced them to spawns all the time when it was really late (because they were in Asia of course!). Wonder if it's the same guild for the most part?</div></div><hr />

Leave the mages at home and bring lots of warlocks. Too bad about their &quot;human resource&quot; issue, more mages should reroll warlock before the next difficult encounter so these guilds will have a larger pool to choose from. We mages are silly for not switching already after Muru and KJ showed us the light.</div></div><hr />

for those hearing of Stars for the first time, they are one of the best PVE guild in the world for long..<br />

25/09/2006 CN 1st, World 7th, KT, NAXX<br />
12/05/2008 CN 1st, World 7th, Muru, Sunwell<br />
16/05/2009 TW 1st, World 2nd, Mimiron HM<br />
10/06/2009 TW 1st, World 3rd, Algalon<br />
<br />
Bear in mind, TW realm delays a few days after EU/US and it's only worse in CN realm..<br />
<br />
and now you all know this:<br />
08/07/2009 TW 1st, World 1st, Alone in the darkness<br />
<br />
It's indeed very hard or to some extent pointless to call one certain guild as the 'world best', but for the dedication Stars shown on Mimiron HM and Yogg+0..and for their fair-play spirit to share the experience with the rest of community (the same day as their kill)...this guild is definately respectable and well worth a huge round of applause from us all..<br />
<br />
The drama between Netease and The9 has caused CNWOW being offline for a month or so, and as far as I know..still no one can tell how long they'll have to wait...for the time being..the total population of active wow player is basically...halved...lol</div></div><hr />

<br />
Makes not much sense. I think what counts is how many people live in that country vs. what they do. So think about olympics - for me the medal &quot;value&quot; makes more sense if we compare it with the country's population (e.g. China can have much more &quot;olympicon&quot; candidates to choose from than US or e.g. UK). So with that relative value it already makes sense. <br />
<br />
50% of WOW players are in Asia, so just expect more world firsts from China and rest.<br />
<br />
Oh and congratulations on this job well done - would be interested to know how much time was spent on it by the guild untill kill was done?!</div></div><hr />

Anyway, the souldrain is bound to be nerfed - a 4x multiplier is quite ridiculous, specially taking into consideration that other &quot;execute&quot; type of skills have a 35% bonus or so. Not even ice lance multi is that high (3x agains frozen targets). While in itself it may seem okish, fact is that turns out to be a hard to balance.<br />
<br />
Expect it to turn into a 2x multi or less (and maybe higher base dmg).</div></div><hr />

But, i dont think that they posted it because they are nice to others, its just to avoid the problems we got earlier with exodus. <br />
STARS has always been one of the world best guilds (they get the patches later then us/eu, if it was the same day/week then they got more world first kills). <br />
To me, it is strange that there isnt any other guild on the world who found out the right strategy to do this, but all on all, STARS did farway the most tries.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
That's because most theorycrafting is based on overpowering fights. Burning something to shorten a difficult phase, out-spamming heavy raid damage, etc. Every fight has mechanics that you must follow, but those are often only viewed as obstacles in the way of &quot;pew more, heal more&quot;.<br />
<br />
When you start the out think a fight, things get interesting. Some members of your raid may need to die for the encounter to be pulled off (and no one may tell you this, aka Steelbreaker's debuff won't be so obvious). There was no obvious ranged tank (aka getting in melee range is impossible or will fuck you up like Mimi or High King).<br />
<br />
What EJ had said was impossible was only impossible because the fatal flaw of the site of to view everything as Patchwerk with, at best, trivial mechanics that a trained monkey could do. Not to say focusing on dps under ideal conditions doesn't have it's merits, but Yogg + 0 obviously isn't ideal conditions. The tank requirements are impossible, the dps requirements on the adds are likewise impossible.<br />
<br />
I haven't done Yogg 0 yet (and neither have you) but it's certainly safe to say it's the most difficult fight conceived. Blizzard probably didn't expect the encounter to be done before any kind of substantial nerf (hell, the fight may as well have been designed as impossible). I remember doing M'uru. For those of you new to raiding, M'uru was formerly the hardest boss yet conceived. But now all I can think of M'uru as a Patchwerk. The dps was high, the healing was high, and the tank damage was insane. There really wasn't the same level of strategy.</div></div><hr />

The game is easy if you want it to be easy and the game is hard if you want it to be hard; just like any other game out there. Every game out there has its own difficulty lvs (which are normally: easy, normal, hard, and godmode) why cant WoW? Blizz even reward better to those who do those hardmodes. By some of you guy's logic every game out there is easy.Why? because I can just put in in easy mode and kill every boss/encounter. so plz stop QQing.<br />

Sorry, but I dont consider a game hard only because they added few pain in ass modes to some bosses. Truly stupid logic. Game is more then a boss fight, you know.<br />

Firefighter doesn't need the gear. just push decent dps and you down it.<br />
On the other side, Freya 3 elder NEEDS THE GEAR BADLY !<br />
If you have people with lower hp than 25k in the raid, they will die.<br />
If your dps sucks on adds, you will get overrun.<br />
I can tell you that Firefighter is by faaar easier than 3 elder Freya in 25 man.<br />
In 10 man 3 elder Freya is easier because you outgear the encounter by far and you just zerg everything, where 10 man Firefighter is still challenging because gear doesn't mean anything if you're stupid.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That doesn't make WoW a hard game, no. That doesn't make WoW an easy game either. That makes WoW a game in which you are constantly fighting the bosses that match your (or actually your guild's) ability (PvE wise, but of course in PvP, on tournament realms where you don't have to level a new char every time your class becomes crap, I believe not many people have the right to say it's easy).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Dude the game can be as hard as you want it to be, questing/grinding is easy and takes no skill so why don't you try naked aoe grinding as a mage or fighting elites or doing quests above your level. Whenever i get bored of easy, no skill 2-3-4-4 questing/grinding. I do something that makes it more interesting/challenging for me.<br />
<br />
Same thing with instances etc.<br />
<br />
The fact remains they have made WoW easy so everyone can enjoy it and not have to spend a lot of time/effort to actually enjoy and do something cool in the game. But the cool thing about the game is you can ramp up the difficulty to as hard as you want it. <br />
<br />
Stop complaining about everyone having welfare epics, the only way it concerns these people it seems is they cant wave their epeen or be special in a video game by having omgpurplez. Sad. If you think getting epics is too easy make it harder.<br />
<br />
Dude there's so much shit you can do and so many ways you can play this game, it's mind boggling.<br />
Its just like other games where unlocking hard mode makes the enemies tougher, more numerous etc, but in this game you unlock the hard modes for yourself. <br />
<br />
So next time you think its too easy, stop whining and do something about it .</div></div><hr />

i don't think it was based solely on sarth3d, drood were just too good can you imagine how good you could be if not that nerf? and the problem with drain is not it's damage but the fact lock does not need to face it's target.<br />

albeit they nerfed voids hp coz of sarth3d;)</div></div><hr />
