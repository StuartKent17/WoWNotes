I'm just very serious when it comes to security and had no plan to hide the problem. (Even if I'm probably overreacting)<br />
<br />
Oh god, MMO-Champion got hacked<br />
Yay! It finally happened! MMO-Champion got hacked! But don't worry too much, the title is mostly here to scare you and make sure you will read the rest. The site got indirectly affected by a very nasty virus called Gumblar, the site is cached in various ways and it means that most users are potentially safe but I strongly suggest that you read the entire post. <br />
<br />
Gumblar, AKA Troj/JSRedir-R, is a botnet driven virus which attacks both websites and normal computers. Sounds scary, and to anyone who owns their own website it is, but to anyone else it's mostly harmless. <br />
<br />
How does it work?<br />
The virus is split into two parts. There's a javascript version, which infects websites, and the actual virus itself which infects computers. Whenever a browser executes the javascript on a website, it runs a Java applet and (through a Java exploit or two) installs the virus onto your computer. The virus, once warm and snug on a computer, looks for any FTP details you may have stored (In dreamweaver, filezilla, pretty much any FTP application) and makes a copy of them.<br />
<br />
For every FTP it manages to get, it attempts to make a connection and then infects the website with the javascript. It does this by opening .js/.html/.php files and attaching a unique version of itself to a position inside the file, usually at the end. This new code is unique per website, not per file, so removing it isn't as daunting as it sounds.<br />
<br />
In addition to spreading itself to every website it can get its claws on, the virus also reprises its role as a traditional Trojan and attempts to install other spyware onto your computer, including redirecting popular websites (such as Google) to its own unsafe alternative.<br />
<br />
How do I know if I have it? How do I get rid of it?<br />
Most modern anti-viruses should pick up the Gumblar virus. Personally I'd suggest downloading and installing Malwarebytes (http://www.malwarebytes.org) and doing a complete system scan. Make absolute sure your anti-virus is up to date before scanning, and make sure it's on a full/intensive scan, take no risks with a quick sweep.<br />
<br />
For webmasters, there's a lovely tool called Unmask Parasites (http://www.unmaskparasites.com) for checking if your website is safe or not. However, if you suspect you may have been infected but this tool returns nothing, you may be best suited to manually look through the files. Open up a few random .js files, and look at the end for a line or two of code that you don't recognise. Open up some .html files for a &amp;lt;script&amp;gt; tag that shouldn't be there. If you find it, take your website down immediately and start removing it. If you have backups, make sure they're clean and restore them. Otherwise, you can manually fix the files. Automated tools do not work so well for this as it's unique code for every website.<br />
<br />
As always, it is recommended you change any private details (such as passwords) after you have confirmed you are safe. While World of Warcraft/Battlenet accounts are not affected by this virus, it is still strongly advised you change your password for it regardless.<br />
<br />
My epics are safe?<br />
Gumblar is a botnet driven virus, which means the infection process is entirely automated by other infected machines, no human intervention. As it was not designed to look for World of Warcraft details, it is not particularly interested in looking for them. This doesn't mean you can slack and use this as an excuse to never change your password though. It's always a good time to change your password!<br />
<br />
Technical details<br />
For more details about Gumblar, see this Wikipedia article (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gumblar) or this Unmask Parasites (http://blog.unmaskparasites.com/2009/05/07/gumblar-cn-exploit-12-facts-about-this-injected-script/) article. For a technical summary of Gumblar, there's a nice article on iss.net (http://www.iss.net/threats/gumblar.html) about it.</div></div><hr />

Downloaded Malwarebytes as I've had some problems with the Jawaw applet lately, kept getting errors from it. I read somewhere that it's just a bug they need to fix but right now I'm getting a bit paranoid so I need to check.</div></div><hr />

I can almost guarantee that it isn't. There was at most a 30 minute period where we had compromising javascript, and it absolutely does not effect your World of Warcraft account.<br />

Most specifically the Adobe flash, and adobe acrobat. Near and around 90% of current day virus infections on the internet occur through those bits of software.</div></div><hr />

Can't give you a time, don't tell them but it's very likely that 90% of the users had no way to be infected because of how we cache files. All the JS files are on Limelight and our caching settings are set to &quot;cache indefinitely&quot;. Basically, only people who downloaded the JS files (= didn't have them cached), on a few Limelight servers, over a fairly small period, got infected. And for most of them it's just a matter of cleaning up a spyware.</div></div><hr />

Kind of a stupid statement. I've played WoW consistently on both Mac and PC, if anything the Mac client can squeeze a bit more out of the same hardware than the Windows client. Neither of them is hugely superior at any rate.</div></div><hr />

Glad that you where able to identify and fix the problem fast tho.<br />
<br />
For the people that are freaked out (Well, you should be a little) there are some alternatives next to AMB that is linked on the front-page.<br />
<br />
Spybot Search And Destroy should, once updated, be able to target and delete any infections that you may have.<br />
<br />
Download it from:<br />
http://www.safer-networking.org/en/download/index.html<br />
<br />
If a full scan with that doesn't give you any results (Or at least related to this specific case) your pretty safe.<br />
And its not as bloated as full-blown virus-scanner+guardians etc, which might be what your looking for.</div></div><hr />

Unless you block _ALL_ javascript apps it didnt.<br />
NoScript basically gives you the option to only allow parts of sites you flag as safe, if one of those gets infected it does nothing, since you already allowed it.<br />
So no, the chances of NosSript saving you from an infection related to this are rather slim.<br />
<br />
<br />

Regarding the website/ftp part of the users/infection:<br />
Since the files got changed with the code would the change show up as an new timestamp on the last edit of that file?</div></div><hr />

Alrighty then, thank you. I just checked my website and it's still there, so that's good. I'll have to ftp in and see if there is anything strange in there and keep an eye on the site for a few days.<br />
<br />
I was at the site here, then went to the store to get a couple of things, so I guess that it's possible that something could have happened in the short time that I was gone. Not sure how long after I visited the site that you had this problem, but I may have been here in that time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;tricking a user into visiting a specially crafted web page or opening a malicious PICT file.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;User interaction is required in that a target must open a malicious file or visit a malicious page.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;local attacker can elevate their privileges during an initial installation or update of iTunes for Windows.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The flaw is caused by an integer overflow error in ColorSync when processing certain images with an embedded color profile, which could be exploited by attackers to potentially execute arbitrary code via a specially crafted web page.&quot;<br />
<br />
You have to open an infected QuickTime .SMIL file. (back in 2007)<br />
<br />
&quot;To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must persuade a user into using QuickTime to open a specially crafted QuickTime movie file.&quot;<br />
<br />
Try not to open random files from sources you don't trust and you'll be fine. Also, most of these were fixed in under a week. I'm fairly confident that there is some form of Mac related &quot;virus&quot; out there, just be careful in what you install or open.<br />
<br />
With that said, there is absolutely nothing wrong with using Windows. Use whichever one you prefer and be smart and safe on either.<br />
<br />
Also, try not to spread mis-information about either OS, there is no point as the only person your choice of OS affects is you.<br />
<br />
<br />
All this is nearly the same on PC... you have to actively do something (or passively ignore it) to get infected.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chaoslux</div><div class="date">2010-05-21, 09:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Technical details<br />
For more details about Gumblar, see this Wikipedia article (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gumblar) or this Unmask Parasites (http://blog.unmaskparasites.com/2009/05/07/gumblar-cn-exploit-12-facts-about-this-injected-script/) article. For a technical summary of Gumblar, there's a nice article on iss.net (http://www.iss.net/threats/gumblar.html) about it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ironically, when i tried to read the article at UnmaskParasites, AVG popped up saying &quot;The website you tried to open has been blocked and detected to contain a Trojan/JS.Downloader (probably Gumblar :p) and AVG will not let you risk your computer life&quot;<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Wait wait wait, are you telling me that all I have to do to allow an attacker to gain full access to a Mac is visit a website (such as a previously safe one that recently got infected itself)? Are you really trying to say that an exploit that loads itself just by going to a webpage isn't a big deal? Excluding local networks, is there really a way to get a virus WITHOUT user interaction of some sort? I'm pretty sure viruses don't just install themselves on isolated box's.<br />
<br />
Edit: Yes I know your overall message was to choose an OS based on whichever you prefer, but it sounds like your trying to downplay very serious vulnerabilities. Also, about exploits being patched within a week, that is generally true AFTER the exploit is made known. Whenever some Russian 16 year old finds a way to cause Facebook to give ring 4 access, he isn't going to tell security companies, he is going to start making the biggest botnet he can before they even realize a botnet is being made.</div></div><hr />

In many cases, people with NoScript would already have added MMOChampion to their whitelists, so the purpose is kind of defeated. With FTP access, the Javascript isn't going to be coming from any other domain (which wouldn't be on the whitelist) since complete file access to the httpdocs of the infected website is gained.</div></div><hr />

I'm no expert but I would say yes, especially the backdoor it allows hackers to get acces to your computer.<br />
You only risk having to reinstall the google and adode programs you have installed.</div></div><hr />

At what time was the infection active on MmoChamp ?<br />
<br />
<br />
It started at 14:30 EST, MMO-Champion wasn't the cause of your computer going crazy. We took down the site around 16:00 EST, and went back online at 17:30EST. <br />
<br />
Technically, people who visited people within that hour and a half could have been infected, but as I said in an earlier comment it only concerns people who didn't get cached versions of the safe files, that's not a lot of people. Also, as far as I know you also need Java on your computer to be infected but that's something I'd rather leave out of the front page news. More people running around with up to date antiviruses isn't a bad thing ^^</div></div><hr />

Make absolute sure your anti-virus is up to date before scanning, and make sure it's on a full/intensive scan, take no risks with a quick sweep.<br />

You are only vulnerable to this attack if you are running an outdated version of Adobe Reader on your computer.<br />

<br />
Visitors to an infected site will be redirected to an alternative site containing further malware, which was once (redacted), but has now switched to a variety of domains. The site sends the visitor an infected PDF that is opened by the visitor's browser or Acrobat Reader. The PDF will then exploit a known vulnerability in Acrobat to gain access to the user's computer. <br />
<br />
If you have Adobe Reader (any version) installed on your PC, please launch it, go to the Help dropdown, and continue to select &quot;Check for Updates&quot; and install what it finds until there are no more updates to install. This will also protect you against the majority of drive-by parasites that are on other sites.</div></div><hr />

Incorrect. The first variants of the virus were believed to have been spread via a PDF file. The latest (2010) variation utilizes Javascript to display a Java application with malicious code.<br />

This happened to a lot of people. Use a virus scan to get rid of it.<br />
I used Microsoft Security Essentials and ESET Smart Security to get rid of what I had.</div></div><hr />

I went to it a few hours ago and avg blocked it, having a lot of ftp details on this laptop I was most annoyed and instantly disconnected my network connection and scanned. AVG appeared to have done its work and everything came back clean though.</div></div><hr />

i'm sorry that your small brain couldn't comprehend the nicely detailed and informative post about the situation. Yes, He could have gotten to the point in one or two paragraphs, but then, we wouldn't have all of the information that we need. i, for one, am extremely grateful for the &quot;long-winded&quot; post.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">parody</div><div class="date">2010-05-25, 05:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Gumblar was named for the first website to host the scripting and associated malware. <br />
<br />
The methods involved to exploit your browsers get updated regularly with the latest exploits. The bot included with the infection can vary on the end host that the exploit includes in its payload.<br />
<br />
I've reviewed many infected sites in my lab and the malware downloaded can be a many as 10 variants of keyloggers and banking trojans. While the malware commonly included with the gumblar infection are not targetting WoW logins, they may be capable of capturing the keystrokes for logging in. <br />
<br />
Many of the suggested AV solutions in this thread are good for cleaning up any infection, if you feel like your AV has not done a good enough job when cleaning up, backup your personal data and re-install your operating system. Once your system has been compromised it can be very hard to nail down exactly what has been changed, updated and installed by the infection. <br />
<br />
Many malware will download other malware binaries as required or instructed by their C&amp;C host. ( gumblar.cn was the first C&amp;C host - hence the name ).<br />
<br />
PM me here if you have questions or @lordparody on twitter. <br />
I am an ISS Threat Analyst and was involved in the original review of the gumblar infections.</div></div><hr />
