Enchanting<br />
Some of these enchants were already changed in a previous patch, I didn't merge the list with the old one to prevent any confusion. If an enchantment is in both list, this one is the most recent and will most likely be on live servers (But keep in mind that anything can change on PTRs, that's what happened with some of these enchants)<br />

Featured Addons – Issue 2 - ClassTimer (By Trell (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?action=profile;u=5774))<br />
Time for another featured addon - and this is truly one that I couldn't ever live without now. It's called ClassTimer.<br />
<br />
ClassTimer will give you timer bars for your relevant skills - for example, Polymorph for a mage, Nightfall for a Warlock, Cyclone for a Druid. This probably isn't making much sense, so let me get to the screenshots, so you can see what I mean.<br />
<br />
Bear in mind that these were taken from my Shaman (Resto) - so the abilities you see on the timer bars here are not necessarily the same ones you would see on your class. However, we will come to that in a bit. As usual, please click any of the links for a full size image.<br />
<br />
Timer Bars<br />
So, this picture (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/january/f_classtimertm_4ca0cdf.jpg) is of the natty timer bars in action, so to speak. It's worth noting at this point that any bar created that is for a skill with charges will also show the number of charges remaining (for example, in this image you can see that I have 3 Charges on my Water Shield remaining).<br />
<br />
You'll notice a 'Forethought Talisman' timer bar on my own timers too - this is a Custom bar, but we'll come to that later in the feature. Here's an example (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/january/f_classtimertm_9a1abd8.jpg) of how the timer bars appear on your targets.<br />
<br />
Config<br />
To get to the configuration screen, simply type '/classtimer' into your textbox. You'll get this screen (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/january/f_classtimercm_0a8a9ca.jpg) come up. Now, you'll notice there is a box on the top of the config screen, named 'Lock'. In this screenshot, the bars are locked, but if you untick the box, you can move them around to wherever you like. I have the following bars enabled: Player bar - this is obviously timer bars for yourself, Target bar - timers for your target, and Focus bar - timers for my current focus.<br />
<br />
You'll also see in the screenshot that you can select whether or not to show your Class skills, one by one. Clicking across all the tabs will show you all your Class skills, and you won't see skills that aren't available to your class.<br />
<br />
General Bar Settings<br />
In this screenshot (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/january/f_classtimergm_eaa65a9.jpg), you'll see the General Bar Settings. I'm only going to show you the option for the Player bar - but the other bars have exactly the same settings/options associated with them. So, ticking enable buffs/debuffs does exactly that. With just enable buffs ticked, you won't see any debuffs on your timer bars.<br />
<br />
The 'Grow Up' tickbox will make your bars grow upwards - example (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/january/f_classtimertm_4ca0cdf.jpg). In the previous image, the bottom bar is where my timerbars are positioned, and 'growing up' ensures that subsequent timer bars that spawn will be above the first bar. Without 'Grow Up' ticked, they would spawn downwards, if that makes any sense <br />
<br />
Use Clicks, Show Only Icons, and Reversed will all do exactly as they say - purely aesthetic changes, although if you like keeping clutter on your UI to a minimum, you could have only the icons and time left showing, saving a fair amount of space.<br />
<br />
Frame Attributes - I don't think this screenshot (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/january/f_classtimerfm_93949ec.jpg) needs any explanation - simple attributes for the 'look' of your timer bars. Width, Height, Scale, Spacing.<br />
<br />
Texts - This option screen (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/january/f_classtimertm_95af082.jpg) is where you can change the font, and size of the text on the actual bars.<br />
<br />
Textures - These are the options for 'prettyfying' your timer bars (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/january/f_classtimertm_8976ec4.jpg). The texture itself is 'Hal S' - from Hals UI (http://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info7975-HalsUIv8.html).<br />
<br />
Custom Timers<br />
So finally, we can get on to the topic of Custom Timers (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/january/f_classtimercm_b45360b.jpg). Now, I like to see the amount of time I have on every single proc that I get from items or enchants. Thankfully, ClassTimer allows you to add as many as you like. All you need to do is click the Timers menu option, then click on the Extras tab, and type the spell name into the box, then click Okay (the Okay button will not appear until you have actually typed something in the textbox).<br />
<br />
However, it does have to be the exact spell name, or the buff/debuff gained/lost when the item or enchant procs. As you can see, I added Forethought Talisman (Trinket proc). You can add as many of these as you like - for example, my Warrior alt has a Sword that has a chance to cast a small Fireball at the target, and put a dot on. I added the spell name exactly as it appeared on the mob as a debuff - and now ClassTimer tracks that too.<br />
<br />
All in all, this addon is very nice - although it may not be to everyones taste <br />
<br />

Dark Legacy #172 - The Shoveltusk Problem (http://www.darklegacycomics.com/172.html) is out! Also, Teh Gladiators (http://www.tehgladiators.com/?p=56) now update on Monday and I will most likely start posting it along with the weekly Dark Legacy.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Peacemoon</div><div class="date">2009-01-12, 12:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Cheers for the info about class timer,let me add one: power aura classic<br />
<br />
power aura classic is very good for alerting you of those pesky short duration buffs you get from fighting also.<br />
<br />
Currently when I get &quot;Surge of Light&quot; a big yellow symbol plays over my character, so I know I have a free flash heal available (and a helpful counter I positioned)<br />
<br />
With holy concentration, I have 2 arcane intellect &quot;eye's&quot; orbiting around my character so I know my next GHeal will be free, and again a helpful timer.<br />
<br />
However power aura classic does take some time to tinker and play around with, so give yourself a good hour to get to grips with it<br />
<br />
There is much more you can do with it then what i've suggested (say, counting combo points) but take my advice and don't go over the top, otherwise you have so many graphical effects showing short term buffs and debuffs, you are back where you started. One or two, and keep them noticable.</div></div><hr />

If you're talking about ClassTimer, the first screenshot is of my own unit frames and ClassTimer bars. ClassTimer is not a unit frame addon ;)<br />
<br />
The unit frame addon I'm currently using is Pitbull though, if you'd like to go check that out ;)</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">darkwarrior42</div><div class="date">2009-01-12, 01:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Trell, is there a way to get Classtimer to track buffs on party members that are neither your target or your focus? For instance, when I cast Sacred Shield on my party members, I would like to see exactly how long each party member's shield has left. <br />
<br />
The only reason I ask is because I couldn't figure out how to make Class Timer do this, and wound up downloading Yatba instead. I like Class Timer better in almost every respect, but I find that specific functionality to useful to run without.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trell</div><div class="date">2009-01-12, 01:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Unfortunately not, unless someone else knows a way to do it. The only options I use are for Focus, Target and Self.</div></div><hr />

The amount of money simply WASTED by me considering these changes is... horrific.<br />
So I want my mats back!<br />
<br />
<br />
Seriously though, healthy changes. The market for northrend greens is so bizzare at the moment due to the distribution of enchanting mats. One greater essence is like 20-25G, and when you have an enchant that currently need 15 it feels like shooting yourself in the leg. I welcome these changes wholeheartedly.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you're encountering this problem, or you just want the same type of addon with a bit of a different flavor, try RoguePowerBars. Yes, they were originally designed for Rogues, but you can add whatever personal buffs or target debuffs you want manually. Also, you can have it track debuffs applied by someone else (for the kitty's mangle problem).</div></div><hr />

<br />
The engineering Scrapbot can now Repair. <br />
Nitro Boosts cooldown is down to 3 minutes from 5 minutes. <br />
The gnomish lightning device isn't instant but can be cast while moving and has a 1 minute cooldown. <br />
Hyperspeed accelerators give 10 seconds of 340 haste on a 1 minute cooldown. <br />
Theres a new schematic for a 32 slot engineering bag on dalaran vendor, think it was called Titanium Toolbox. <br />
And non engineering related... The Arcanite Ripper now actually looks like a guitar instead of the arcanite reaper</div></div><hr />

Get Spellreminder (http://wow.curse.com/downloads/wow-addons/details/spell-reminder.aspx) and give that a go. I use it to track both Sacred Shield and Beacon of Light on my pally when raiding. It works a treat for me.<br />
<br />
If you don't trust curse get it from wowace (http://www.wowace.com/projects/spell-reminder/) instead.</div></div><hr />

Fur lining and the ability to make Heavy Borean Leather are at the moment the only benefits from the profession that was a must in SWP?<br />

gg.<br />
<br />
Yeah, you might have noticed that Leatherworking (or any other profession) being a must is exactly what they're trying to avoid. I'm truly sorry that your profession isn't an absolute requirement for raiding anymore... ::)<br />
<br />
Anyway, so far it seems like they're managing pretty well with the profession balancing, except engineering. I dropped that for Alchemy, after 2 years of it I rather had enough of not being able to make anything but toys that no one will buy or use.</div></div><hr />

Drums weren't an absolute requirement for raiding but anyone who took leatherworking for drum use wasn't screwing themselves out of anything significant.<br />
<br />
Oh me oh my, whatever shall a warrior without blacksmithing do!<br />
<br />
Blizzard said they were trying to avoid professions having things that people &quot;had&quot; to have but if you had to have drums then you have to have the fur lining, the cloak embroidery and so on.<br />
<br />
Blizzard went to the trouble of making new drums and adding a debuff to stop people chainging them, so why remove them?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also Blacksmithing and Jewelcrafting have wtf powerful gems and sockets.<br />
While Leatherworkers get &quot;only&quot; the Fur linings (which are brilliant for fur tanks, don't get me wrong).<br />
<br />
Jewelcrafter-only gems give a lot less stats (especially when the epic gems are released) than Blacksmith sockets or Enchanter ring enchants. Engineering and Tailoring doesn't give anything extra at all (that isn't highly bothersome to keep track of or really situational).<br />
There's a lot of stuff missing to professions.</div></div><hr />

Spellweave -&gt; used to require Nexus, now requires Azure Dragonshrine in Dragonblight<br />
Ebonweave -&gt; Used to requre Altar of something (in icecrown), now requires Maw of Neltharion (Obsidian dragonshrine in Dragonblight)<br />
Moonshroud -&gt; actually not changed, shouldn't have mentioned it LAWL!<br />
