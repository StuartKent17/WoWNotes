I sort of agree with you, though he looks badass. I'm thinking it will take much longer to clear Ulduar than most people think, with not being able to come up with complete strats and timers due to the way they're giving limited access to Ulduar content.

<br />
Would seriously be crap if it didn't heal over time, and it would be crap to if it does heal over time, but got sorta nerfed because it heals by Corruptions damage.<br />

Cuz druids got shit tons of changes right?<br />
<br />
saying arms warriors are &quot;unplayable&quot; is a pretty extreme statement. Plenty of arms warriors are doing pretty dam good in pvp. Its just not a super PvE spec right now. Not every spec is good at everything.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
The change to BL/Hero makes sense and is actually a good change.<br />
<br />
Think about it this way.<br />
<br />
Pvp - Because the debuff is removed upon Death (Which is far to likely as a Shaman) you will be able to use BL/Hero even more. <br />
<br />
Pve - Again, as the debuff is removed upon Death, raids will be able to re-engage a boss sooner without having to wait on the actual CD of BL/Hero. (That is if you don't have two shaman's, which is more likely in 5-10man than 25man, but still useful.)<br />
<br />
<br />
Would a 5min CD and 5min Debuff be better? Sure, but it seems like they want to steer away from raids getting two BL/Hero for a boss (Thad anyone?) while being able to recover and restart sooner.<br />
<br />
<br />
As this is the first day for all this, it could easily be changed, but it's not a horrible change or nerf really.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I guess it means you can have BL/Hero on every attempt with only 1 shaman in the raid, and the debuff wears off on death, so that means you can cast it once per fight.</div></div><hr />

Common, you get a new 2-pointer in Elemental which is going to compete with all your most important talents for 2 points! And you'll still have to waste 2~3 points in tier 1~5 just to reach it! Isn't that great?<br />

It's actually doing very well. The patch on their test server right now brought most of the changes the player base wanted. The game had its fair share of hiccups the first few months, because of a very rushed release date. It's very fun to play right now. PvP is definitely more fun than WoW currently. PvE there's no comparison, WoW is the blatant winner. God forbid another game doesn't have the 11 million subscription base Blizzard has.</div></div><hr />

it will never have remotely the same success as WoW. To say there are doing a better job at class balance between pvp and pve is stupid, since the pve in WAR is nothing more then a waste of your time. its easy to balance something no one actually does or cares about. <br />

Stop being so defensive. Yes there's no PvE to really balance around, that doesn't make it any less true that the PvP is playing quite nicely at the moment. No, it's never going to reach WoW's subscription numbers. It's a niche game, they should be ecstatic if they ever hit a million in the next year or so.</div></div><hr />

if you were being brought purely for your solo DPS, your raid is already retarded. You bring buffs, you bring another replenishment. And hopefully the people you raid with kinda like you. <br />

Your DPS will not be nerfed soooo badly that your raid buffs (THE ONLY REASON TO BRING A RET PALLY ANYWAY) will be overlooked, casuing you to be replaced by another mage/lock/rogue.</div></div><hr />

You don't really believe this &quot;24 classes&quot;-shit, do you ?<br />
I would say in war they got 4 - 6 classes with skilltrees which are a joke. Not much to balance there.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gestalt</div><div class="date">2009-02-24, 09:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Are you kidding me?! Im a DK Frost tank and i dont use HC its freakin worthless outside of pvp or daily grinding. and Frost Aura used to bring some utility with us to raids, cause gods know people are leary of DK's anyway so i cant pug outta my friends who know im a good one. And HB at bottom means im giving up Threat gen else where Jesus Blizz, if these changes go through im gonna shelf my favorite toon. F this crap<br />
<br />
<br />
The overall impact of the changes is a solid net-gain for tanking specs, which generally have to go deeper into their tree of choice than DPS specs (for expertise and Tank buttons, if for no other reason). In-tree synergy is stronger across the board, cross-tree synergy is somewhat reduced. You'll have to go deeper into Frost than you may have been doing, but you'll be doing substantially more damage (thanks to the new BotN and Glacier Rot), taking a fair bit less (now that Unbreakable Armor is flat damage reduction), and have a LOT more flexibility in your utility speccing. The Blood changes grant more linear damage increases, better bang out of previously &quot;meh&quot; talents, etc. Ditto Unholy. <br />
<br />
Know who this nerfs? 31/40 DW and its cousins, i.e. Proc specs and diseaseless specs. They're going to be SCREAMING because the HB/Garg spec is no longer possible and cross-tree proc chaining is dead. Shocking as it may be, that build style was never intended. From day one the DK trees were designed around the intent of deep-tree speccing and these changes only reinforce that. DK's that are at least 51 deep are getting buffed. DK's that are 41 or less are, more or less, getting nerfed. <br />
<br />
Don't forget that this is also coming along with Dual Speccing and that you will be able (if you're prepared) to swap specs during a raid. You can bring an AoE/Small hits build and a Boss/Big Hits build, or a Physical and Mixed build, etc. This more directly effects DK's than other tanks, as we have the broadest potential variety in our tank specs. <br />
<br />
Don't quit. 3.1 is a great time to be a DK.<br />
<br />
The nerf that's going to sting me the hardest isn't technically a DK nerf. The changes to Blessing of Sanctuary are going to hit me HARD. Sitting around 70% avoidance in raid buffs, BoSanc meant I could throw on a 1.5 1-hander and never main-hand white swing (they were *all* rune strikes). That's definitely going the way of the dodo. I'll adjust, and the gains more than make up for the losses.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gonard</div><div class="date">2009-02-24, 09:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i already posted this many times but it has too be said yet again. Those are not the changes shaman need. No where near. I do not care what anyone says shaman need to be able too tank. Remove the Elemental Earth and Fire totem, return Rockbiter back to the way it was Patch 1.6 return Shield specialization the way it was Patch 1.9 Return the defense of shaman back to the way it was with 150 additional Defense which was removed. Restore shamans resistances to normal not as high as it is now. <br />
<br />
<br />
Restore shamans taunts back to the way they were. without diminishing returns. Aka Back on Earth shocks. Remove the Base Percentage of mana from shaman spells. Remove Global cool downs. increase 2 handed weapons damage by 75% of what it is now. Restore the proc rate of windfury back to the way it was at 40% from patch 1.6. <br />
<br />
Increase shamans armor back to the equivalent to warriors armor -10% as it was patch 1.10. Return toughness back to +10% Armor increase the way it is suppose to be. Increase the shamans natural health To equal to any class melee. Tanking Aka Druids bear level and warriors DPs and tanking level. Remove intellect from Ancestral knowledge replace with Stamina. Change Anticipation to 20 defense.<br />
<br />
You don't need Snare reductions if they MISS YOU OR RESIST there spell or ranged attacks. move Stormstrike back to 41 point talent tree. This goes without saying change Windfury BACK to the old animation back to Nature spell attack. and WHY? Because paladins use Holy attacks and shaman us Nature attacks because there the only stats that have penetration to them that most people don't wear resist for.<br />
<br />
Particularly holy which there is no gear to protect against holy attacks. Hunters use Nature attacks but shaman are the ones who got nerfed from this. The mechanics DONT work they have never worked change it back. There was never a need to change this. Make sure Stormstrike is 2 attacks and adds the debuff of 20% Nature spell damage So windfury WORKS AS INTENDED! i cannot expand on that anymore.<br />
<br />
Remove improved StormStrike it as a dumb idea before and still is. Remove mental dexterity. Shaman who are enhancement should NEVER be stacking intellect. It is possible to give it to a Elemental or restoration shaman but at this current point it is not necessary at all. Remove weapon mastery and Unleashed rage an increase shamans base melee damage as it should. This is why When a Elemental shaman gets silenced they are forced to melee. By putting the abilities to deal melee damage ONLY in Enh nerfs Elemental to be completely dependant on Spell casting which is NOT how the elemental spec works.<br />
<br />
<br />
Remove lava lash Makes absolutely no sense. Add a form of raptor strike and move it to level 35 trainable talent. Remove Dual wield from 41 point talent to 21 point talent in enhancement. Restore shield specialization back in 1 point talent of Enhancement.<br />
<br />
Remove mental quickness and Static Shock. Both unnecessary. Add 41 Dual wield specialization that increases weapon damage in the off hand by 25%. Change windfury totem back to 2 additional attacks but lower the attack power to 650 attack power and windfury weapon back to 1200 attack power. Rockbiter back to 1400 attack power and 500 Threat. Then add 36 talent improved 2 handed use. that increases 2 handed weapon damage. This prevents nerfing the damage.<br />
<br />
Remove the damage reduction from shamanistic rage. Apply to base class status. Again if you do not make these changes you will lose more players playing the shaman class.</div></div><hr />

The system could run you fast at the &quot;station&quot; on previous boss instead. Wtb one in Naxx also :D<br />
<br />
Given that the files also list a 'StormwindWing' , I think it's more likely we'll get further proof of how the Old God's tentacles have spread throughout Azeroth... Perhaps it emerges that an old tram used to link Ulduar with Stormwind, and this tram is rediscovered. Perhaps Yogg Saron has spread his influence from beneath Stormwind (could this explain why Varian is so irrational in his desire to destroy the Horde- Yogg Saron's influence to divide the Horde and Alliance?), perhaps Yogg is planning to invade Stormwind with his Faceless Ones and they've built an underground tram to ferry Dark Iron troops to SW etc etc etc. <br />
<br />
The lore possibilities are endless, and I really hope some of the above come to pass- it would make Ulduar fit far more into the story of WOTLK than just &quot;Here's something to keep you busy for a few months until we've finished designing the Icecrown raid&quot;. The fact that there are also LichKing wings and a WyrmrestTemple file is also really exciting- might we find out more about whether Yogg is influencing Arthas? What is the link between Ulduar/Yogg and Wyrmrest?<br />

* Prospector Khazgorm, found in Bael Modan in southern Barrens, now sells the recipe for Dig Rat Stew to the Alliance.<br />

Side note I know, but what about Hordies that want the Alli exclusive recipes? ( Roasted Moongraze Tenderloin, Kaldorei Spider Kabob, Tasty Lion Steak) We get the shaft? o.O<br />
Same as all the other merchant-bought Horde recipes, you can buy them on neutral AH (or in your own AH by people with an entrepreneur mind). The problem with Dig Rat Stew was that even horde could only get it through a lvl 19 quest, which meant that it sold for 1k gold at alliance AH.<br />
I don't know if there is any quest-reward alliance recipe that would be equivalent to that.</div></div><hr />

Actually he listed the 3 alliance only cooking recipes: Roasted Moongraze Tenderloin, Kaldorei Spider Kabob, Tasty Lion Steak. So yes i am happy i don't have to level a new toon to 19 every time i want one or re make a DK just to get the recipe, I do think that the horde should get the same think for those recipes.</div></div><hr />

TAKE BACK EVERY CHANGE THAT NERFED SOMETHING OP, MAKE IT ALL OP AGAIN, I WILL BE HAPPY, PLZ AND THX Nothing about the shaman class was ever overpowered. Warlocks were overpowered Rogues were Warriors were. Shaman were never overpowered. Add we can take a long history of how paladins were overpowered. From bata to now. So try to actually learn the class before talking about it like you know the class.<br />
<br />
ill even expand on this. A class that is overpowered wears green or blue gear at high levels an can beat other classes effortlessly without more than its natural buffs. The only class that have never been overpowered in this case is Priest and Shaman. They are the only ones. Every other class got OP. Rogues Hunters Warlocks Mages Druids &amp; Warriors.

yeah then enjoy playing a broken class in PvP. And lets see how long you will enjoy the class on a PvP server which i might add is now dead for horde sides. The only people playing are alliance shaman. Because the rest of the horde side refuse to play something that is broken and does not get the issues it has had for 4 years addressed. The only reason you accept it is because you don't know the issues. And neither does the development. i have been posting them for years. Talking to many people. Testing them hour after hour for years and years. I know. If you disagree and you play a shaman you should be completely embarrassed over your comment.</div></div><hr />

He was talking about 25-man content. Thanks God you cleared naxx 10, 10 man content beeing so easy that a fucking retarded monkey could achieve it.<br />

Because 10 mans are the focus of raiding Balance right? You clearing 1 wing of naxx 25 man, and sartherion with no drakes, in no way puts a bad tint on your skill and expertise.<br />
<br />
And im sorry Mr pro 10 man, you have done all the easy fights, but not the ones that require any difficulty, like sartherion with drakes.<br />
<br />
im also sorry that you think 2.6k DPS is acceptable, when myself, and most other DPS specs with gear as good as mine, can do 4k on a target dummy with no raid buffs.<br />

<br />
obviously they changed instant poison at least to be PPM.. and buffs increase frequency rather than 'chance'</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tyvlen</div><div class="date">2009-02-24, 10:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The overall impact of the changes is a solid net-gain for tanking specs, which generally have to go deeper into their tree of choice than DPS specs (for expertise and Tank buttons, if for no other reason). In-tree synergy is stronger across the board, cross-tree synergy is somewhat reduced. You'll have to go deeper into Frost than you may have been doing, but you'll be doing substantially more damage (thanks to the new BotN and Glacier Rot), taking a fair bit less (now that Unbreakable Armor is flat damage reduction), and have a LOT more flexibility in your utility speccing. The Blood changes grant more linear damage increases, better bang out of previously &quot;meh&quot; talents, etc. Ditto Unholy. <br />
<br />
Know who this nerfs? 31/40 DW and its cousins, i.e. Proc specs and diseaseless specs. They're going to be SCREAMING because the HB/Garg spec is no longer possible and cross-tree proc chaining is dead. Shocking as it may be, that build style was never intended. From day one the DK trees were designed around the intent of deep-tree speccing and these changes only reinforce that. DK's that are at least 51 deep are getting buffed. DK's that are 41 or less are, more or less, getting nerfed. <br />
<br />
<br />
Don't quit. 3.1 is a great time to be a DK.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I dont know where your looking from, but Howling Blast is great for Threat and is getting a huge nerf here. im already 51 in Frost, but thats not the point, the fact of the matter is, i used pestilence and blood boil for threat as well, now their halfing that threat gen, nerfing dmg of HB so that its less threat gen, im not lacking in threat, but it seems they're going to make you work extra hard for it. and yes this is a huge nerf to DK tanks, im still not sure on the whole Unbreakable armor thing, as it was one of my extra evasion buttons i loved the parry, its gone now too. these are nerfs not buffs</div></div><hr />

'The Argent Tournament' ?<br />

<br />
<br />
Vehicle Tournament as far as I'm aware.<br />
<br />
For whoever asked about it being on the Long Strange Trip meta : No. It's not a holiday. &gt;_&gt; Speaking of holidays, Noblegarden has a whole crapton of achieves now too.<br />
<br />
Edit - In patch 3.1, a new world event titled “The Argent Tournament” will be coming to Northrend! This tournament will be live on the 3.1 PTR and open for testing, though certain aspects are still in development. Players will find a host of new features here, including:<br />
<br />
* The ability to prove your worth to a capital city of your choosing through our new mounted combat system (still in development)<br />
* New daily quests to construct the great Argent Crusade coliseum for glorious battles to come<br />
* All new rewards - new items, titles, banners, tabards, pets, mounts, and more<br />
* All new achievements<br />
* Many more festivities, and more to come in future content updates!<br />
<br />
<br />
Players will find the Argent Tournament in Icecrown. Speaking to any Northrend flight master will get you on track to prove your worth to the Argent Crusade, your faction’s leaders, and all denizens of Azeroth!<br />

Have to correct this...<br />

Improved Devotion Aura now increases the amount healed on any target affected by ANY of your Auras by 2%/4%/6%.</div></div><hr />

That could be fun. From what I could see on the PTR there wasn't a meta in place for it as of yet (as far as I could tell between crashes, whee!). As long as Blizz doesn't decide to attach it to the LTS meta and stick it in a month that's already passed, cause that would be totally bogus.

I've heard this bandied about a lot, but are there actually any new achieves there?

Yeah, it's gone from the two achieves tied to it on live to a good 6-10. I can get up screenshots in a second here. The calendar is also showing Noblegarden as lasting a week now. Not sure if that varies from the Live servers atm, as I never really paid attention. Though it was just a Sunday thing.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cyraneth</div><div class="date">2009-02-24, 01:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">[Shaman]<br />
The ghostwolfs. Get rid of them. With the increase in armor &amp; defense the problems of the abilities shaman handling 2 or more mobs or players on them will vanish. Come up with something better. Like a Cleave effect. Separate The taunt ability of parry for shaman from the taunt itself. Shaman are suppose to be able to handle mass mobs. Add a button to turn on and off Taunts.<br />
<br />
Restore Earthbind, Frostband, &amp; Frost shock back to 75% snare and Not 50% Those abilities were put there at 75 for the specific purpose to prevent mobs and other classes (especially Mages &amp; Hunters) from getting distance on a shaman once a shaman gets close to them to lay one blow on them. Changing the talent to 50% allowed other classes to get range on the shaman because shamans snares are NOT 85% like rogues Immobilization's like casters and Stuns like Melees. <br />
<br />
Change shocks back to the way they were patch 1.3-1.12 Change them back to 4 second silence and remove Windshock. Grounding totem needs to be back to the way it was Patch 1.6 It absorbs 1 damaging spell or with a 50% chance to absorb 2. Note that the amount of spells casters cast now are many. <br />
<br />
Thus they can cast up to 4 spells per 2 seconds. This includes pets attacking players. If a felhound is casting a mana burn it must be absorbed by the totem. But if a Mages pet is also casting on the shaman the shamans totem must absorb that as well. So you have little choice but to increase the number of absorbed spells the totem received to prevent increasing the amount of times shocks can be landed on an opponent.<br />
<br />
The only totems that needed to be combined were the elemental totems. Because there are 3 freaking totems. That do NOT protect against Shadow and Arcane damage. Which should have been added to the game by level 35-50 to reduce the damage taken. <br />
<br />
Also Add gear for enhancement.Play the class an learn it. you will find the primary stat you should need for Enhancement is Only strength &amp; Stamina. Changing this to adding intellect or agility brakes the game function. And is stupid. We are NOT hunters. We are close range fighters. So adding ranged spells would be in all sense dumb. Move malmstrom weapon to 46 point talent. And that should fix all the current issues with the class and then you can start working on improving the class. Anyone who disagrees with this doesn't know anything about shaman. and any CM/GM who disagrees should be sacked.<br />
<br />
This is HOW THE CLASS WORKS! i cant make it any clearer than that. Ive been playing sense 6 months after release. I know my class.<br />
<br />
<br />
Seems like someone woke up after a 2-year long nap and thought the Shaman was still a tank class. They went away from that already at the end of Vanilla WoW. They wanted to differentiate the Paladin and Shaman class, so the Paladin got the tank shtick and the Shaman got the caster shtick, meaning the Paladin isn't a DpS caster and the Shaman ISN'T A TANK!<br />
<br />
The quoted poster might wish the Shaman became a tanking class again, but that's just not going to happen. Almost 18 months after the decision was made to make the Paladin the tank and the Shaman the non-tank, they've developed both classes immensely. It's very, very unlikely they'll undo all this development for the sake of a minority of Shaman players. If you really want to tank, play one of the 4 tanking classes: Death Knight, Druid, Paladin, or Warrior.</div></div><hr />

You bring buffs, you bring another replenishment. And hopefully the people you raid with kinda like you. <br />
<br />
Your DPS will not be nerfed soooo badly that your raid buffs (THE ONLY REASON TO BRING A RET PALLY ANYWAY) will be overlooked, casuing you to be replaced by another mage/lock/rogue.<br />
<br />
<br />
*Ahem* other classes with more DPS (they're pure dps classes huh? and some of them don't stop getting buffs) getting replenishment...<br />
<br />
Kings as base skill...<br />
<br />
Mana regen nerf (and spiritual atunment on paladins also)...<br />
<br />
Ret paladin DPS lower when not fighting undead/demons, that's why Blizzard said that they will need to buff it for Ulduar, since from what they told us, it's going really down in there...<br />
<br />
1st solution: enable exorcism on all targets with isn't that much DPS increase alone (with will lead to OOM since it isn't part of their basic rotation for not going OOM and with the nerfs to mana regen, will really @%$# ret paladins instead of increasing DPS).<br />
<br />
2nd solution: Nerf PVE talents (Righteous Vengeance, that was alread nerfed for PvP and became a PvE oriented talent) and nerf the other source of good damage (fanaticism).<br />
<br />
So, you need a good increase. To achieve that, you decrease it???<br />
<br />
Yes, it's not complete... that's the only hope for ret and arms warriors...<br />
<br />
Also, some retarded changes for DKs (mostly for Blood DK Tanks). Remove expertise from the physical spec, nice. Hope that Armor Penetration get a huge buff and T8 get some good chunk of expertise.<br />
<br />
Btw, are those blacksmith DPS plans? They look like TANK plans, even with crit... way too much stamina instead of strengh...</div></div><hr />

We don't know if it will be a healer mace.<br />
<br />
First of all, despite 4 classes being able to use Atiesh, each version was different stat wise.<br />
<br />
Secondly, with stats like Spell power which covers offensive and healing spells, it's not that hard to setup an item so that it can be both/either.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think it's highly likely that this will be a 'Hard Mode reward'- i.e. the shards will only drop from Hard mode versions of the encounters in Ulduar. That way there's a very tangible way of differentiating between 'leet' raiders and us mere mortals. That would make sense going forward into WOTLK- nobody wants every Johnny Raider running around with Frostmourne (as an example), so make it (or the shards of it) drop only in super-duper-ultra Hard Mode. Non hardcore raiders still get to see the content, they just don't get the absolute tip top gear.</div></div><hr />
