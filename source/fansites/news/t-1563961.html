Warlords of Draenor Features<br />
The OP appears to be a copy/paste from a forum reply on MMO-Champion (http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/1543050-quot-Promised-content-quot?p=27890428&amp;viewfull=1#post27890428), which is unfortunate as almost everything listed is just incorrect, if not intentionally misleading. Reading it I'm tempted to say it's a well crafted troll because ... I'll say: because of the outlandishness of some of the claims, but the fact that it has so many upvotes here tells me that either people didn't read it, or they're agreeing with something that promotes their general feeling without counting on any of the specific points being made.<br />
<br />
Being wary of a feature or direction is absolutely warranted, being unhappy or even upset about something is something we want to know about, providing feedback and telling us how you feel about something is critical to us so we can create an excellent gaming experience, but it's so absolutely important that everyone be curious, and research, and want to learn, and become knowledgeable, and use that knowledge to empower what they themselves think and say. I see a lot of people here are being critical of the points listed, which restores some of me, but so many are assuming the things they're told are true, and that's a poisonous way to ... hell, to go through life, let alone how to feel about a video game.<br />
<br />
Simply repeating what someone else said is so very easy, and especially in this case, a good way to undermine your own voice. Have a voice, be critical, but do it because you have something to say. That is what is helpful, and that is what we want to hear.<br />
<br />
For those in the thread attempting to inform people of what is accurate, we appreciate your effort. We'll try to step it up to help you out.<br />
<br />
Sorry Bashiok, but OP is right about a number of things, including the massive amounts of cuts to content on launch, low number of dungeons, and extreme dumbing down of PVE. Look at the forest from outside of the trees. You and the rest of the devs.<br />
Massive cuts of what? Faction hubs being in a different place? There are 7 dungeons + an updated max level UBRS. What does extreme dumbing down mean? This kind of response is the exact point of my previous reply.<br />
<br />
Ability pruning for one.<br />
After 10 years of adding more and more abilities, there's a point when we need to take a critical look at all that we have wrought. We can't just constantly add more and more and more abilities to the game forever and expect it to hold up under the weight of itself. Our intent as a company is always to design simple systems with lots of fun gameplay depth. Easy to learn difficult to master is our motto. Having tons of abilities does not necessarily make a game deep or fun, just complex. We've posted these exact points many times. If you disagree with Blizzard's core design principles, or any specific changes being made, we'd be happy to hear specific feedback, but saying a game is going to be bad because there are less class abilities is not particularly helpful, or even accurate.<br />
<br />
This thread is getting a lot of attention, which is unfortunate, as it's chock full of misinformation. Let me clarify what I can:<br />
<br />
-Black Temple and Frostwolf keep no longer hub cities, just quest locations you visit once.<br />
They won't be hub cities, true. They're a bit more than &quot;just quest locations you visit once,&quot; though.<br />
<br />
-New faction cities are copy pastes of the 4.1 krasarang wilds faction bases in ashran, an island in nowhere<br />
Even in their current state in Beta, this is false. They don't look anything like the Krasarang bases. Also, they're nowhere near complete in the current build. They'll look closer to what we're aiming for in the next one.<br />
<br />
-Garrisons only in one zone now, no longer customization, no longer lets you name npcs, no longer has skill boosts, is just a daily quest hub phased to you.<br />
True, false, true, false, extremely false.<br />
<br />
-average class goes from 40 spells to 7<br />
I'd double check your math. We pruned some abilities, but in even the most extreme cases it wasnâ€™t nearly that many.<br />
<br />
-no new skeletons or animations, literally every creature in the expansion is a remodelled creature.<br />
False. Even the new character models are getting re-done animations.<br />
<br />
-portions of entire zones are copy pasted from the BC devset<br />
False. Everything has been built from scratch.<br />
<br />
-the rest are not flying compatible and have 2d jpg mountains -now you know why shamans had far sight and hunters had eagle vision removed.<br />
False. Every zone is built to be capable of flying, and I have no idea where you're getting &quot;2d jpg mountains&quot; from. Also, Far Sight and Eagle Eye were not removed.<br />
<br />
-now only 4 dungeons from level 90-100<br />
There are 4 dungeons from 90-99, and 4 more that open at level 100.<br />
<br />
-client code for garrison cash shop functionality discovered, quickly removed along with tweet mentioning it from cory stockton<br />
This never happened and such functionality is not planned, please don't spread false rumors.<br />
<br />
-less raid content at launch than any expansion<br />
False. The first tier of Warlords raiding contains 17 bosses.<br />
<br />
-less dungeons than cataclysm had in PATCHES<br />
False. Cataclysm added 3 brand new dungeons in 4.3, and 2 updated dungeons in 4.2. Warlords is launching with 7 new dungeons and 1 updated dungeon.<br />
<br />
-no flying<br />
True, at least at launch.<br />
<br />
-story is a barely canon side timeline alternate dimension just to give another enemy to fight while trying to lure in veterans with nostalgia and a 'veterans first!&quot; beta access program<br />
Story opinions are subjective, but Iâ€™m sorry to hear youâ€™re not as excited about it as we are. We've had tons of requests over the years for veteran perks.<br />
<br />
-almost all CC removed in pvp. totally removed in pve<br />
False and completely false.<br />
<br />
-adding healing and tanking npcs in quests<br />
I don't know what this is referring to. Maybe the occasional quests where you rescue someone and they help you fight for a brief time? Is that a bad thing?<br />
<br />
-Heirloom and tabard storage tab just cut until &quot;later&quot;<br />
True, though they havenâ€™t been cut, merely delayed.<br />
<br />
-replacing quests with &quot;dynamic, interactive world experiences&quot; that appear once and when you do them disappear leaving huge swathes of zones empty.<br />
Questing hasn't been &quot;replaced&quot;, and the &quot;appear once and then disappear&quot; bit is just false. Maybe youâ€™ve just encountered an unfinished zone in Beta?<br />
<br />
-new models have a single face and the cosmetic choices in almost every model but undead simply adds a new texture to said single face.<br />
False. Have you seen our recent ArtCraft on the topic?<br />
<br />
-homogenized healing to the point that its all just different colours now<br />
False, but if you have specific feedback on why you feel that way, we'd love to hear it.<br />
<br />
-guild levleing removed<br />
True. We think this is a good thing.<br />
<br />
-talents auto fill per spec to avoid confusion.<br />
False and I have no idea why you'd think this was the case.<br />
<br />
-80% of announcements from blizzcon for the expansion are confirmed cut or extremely truncated in some way.<br />
We've made some cuts since Blizzcon, yes, but not nearly that many. We try to be as open as possible about what weâ€™re dreaming up when we first announce an expansion, but a lot of things change and evolve from those basic concepts as development ramps up.<br />
<br />
Regarding Twitter: it's a medium we're still kind of trying to figure out how to utilize most effectively. It's an extremely powerful way to talk to and engage with the community, but it's not great for everything, and we've certainly made some missteps. We're learning, though. <br />
<br />
This feedback is what really discourages me about the direction WoD is heading. &quot;Story opinions are subjective&quot; is not a helpful thing to tell players who are dissatisfied with the way you're telling a story. It more or less brushes them off and tells them that their opinions are worth less than other players.<br />
Definitely not my intention, and I apologize for being unclear if you've taken it that way. I only called it subjective because, while I would call it false, opinions don't really lend themselves well to true/false answers. I'm excited about the WoD storyline, but that may not be the case for everyone (and feedback on why you're not is very useful!)<br />
<br />
But really, it's indicative of an even larger problem: you say you like feedback, but you don't respond to it unless it's positive. When something is brought up that the playerbase doesn't like, you don't talk about it and then sit back and wait for us to accept it.<br />
<br />
It's like what you want to say is &quot;we love feedback, but only if it validates our current ideas about where we'd like to go.&quot;<br />
One extremely important thing I want to get across here: when we're not talking about something publicly, that means we're talking about it internally. We're discussing the feedback and trying to determine what, if any, action needs to be taken. And until we have a solid answer, we don't want to tease people with a &quot;we read this, but don't have anything to share just yet&quot; response. Aside from the fact that it would slow us down dramatically (we read a LOT of feedback every day), we just don't think a non-answer is a great one.<br />
<br />
That said, we're always aiming to improve how we communicate, and definitely get the message that we can do better. We'll keep aiming to improve. <br />
<br />

Targeted Feedback Request: Quest Bottlenecks<br />
Beta is a crucial time for players to make their voices heard and give feedback to help make Warcraft the best game possible. While all constructive feedback is appreciated, one specific type of feedback that is uniquely valuable to us are examples of things that slow you down while questing out in the world: there's a lot of words to describe these types of situations, but perhaps the best word is &quot;bottlenecks&quot;. <br />
<br />
Bottlenecks are basically the term we use to describe situations that stop players from questing at their normal pace. Players tend to progress through zones and quests at different rates, but if a quest target (object, drop rate, or mob spawning rate) is too rare, it can really slow players down. The fastest players will run into this first, and they might get through without too much of a reduction in their speed, but just like a traffic jam on a highway more and more people will pileup behind them.<br />
<br />
This type of testing is super important for you folks to look for while leveling through zones in the beta. While my Quality Assurance (QA) team works to find and report issues like this in our testing, we're not able to easily replicate the large numbers of players hitting quests and zones at the same time.<br />
<br />
In an effort to keep things organized, I've made one thread for each Draenor Questing zone. Please click on the appropriate link below and post in that thread with any examples of situations where you were slowed down by questing due to a bottleneck of some kind.<br />

Beta EU Character Copy<br />
EU character copies are coming. We're hoping to have them functional in the next major build.<br />
<br />
To give a little insight: the beta realms are located in one of our North American datacenters. European characters are, obviously, located in European datacenters. For a number of obscure technical reasons, getting those datacenters to securely communicate with each other to transfer character data has been a much larger challenge than we expected.<br />
<br />
We think we've got it solved, though, so (fingers crossed) you should be able to copy your characters soon! (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/329331-when-will-be-eu-character-copy/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/13661596077?page=1#10))<br />

Stat Squish Status<br />
Just a quick update here: all old world content should now be properly scaled. <br />
<br />
If you want, go on some transmog runs, go do old content like you do on live, etc. In general, everything should be similar or easier than it used to be. Please report any issues you encounter here.<br />
<br />
Known problems:<br />
Damage reflect effects like Reliquary's Aura of Desire will cause excessive backlash damage. Boss fights that rely on healing NPCs (e.g. Valithria, Sinestra) will be very difficult to complete due to the bonus vs. lower-level targets not applying to healing. <br />
<br />
These two problems should both be fixed next build. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/317916-stat-squish-status/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/13019692478?page=1#2))<br />
<br />
&quot;Premade Groups&quot; / Group Finder Feedback<br />
There's a known (major) issue with the tool currently, where the server handling the group matchmaking can crash and fail to recover, breaking the tool for everyone. It should be fixed next build, but I'll provide an update if anything changes before then. (Blue Tracker[/b] (]Classes<br />
Whichever dev thought giving Hunter/MagesRogue huge raid utility while taking away Tranq/HTT/Devo/etc from hybirds is making a mistake. #WoD<br />
Do you disagree with the reasoning, or the strength of the relevant cooldowns? (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/492740713797275648))<br />
I think it is neutering hybrids too much. Example:Why bring a moonkin over another pure if they are even remotely on par w/ dmg?<br />
Hybrids and pures will do the same damage, and bring the same utility. That's the goal for Warlords. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/492741585876959232))<br />
Roar/HotW/Vortex isnt in the same ballpark as Smokebomb, Raid raid movement, Amp Magic, etc.<br />
[Roar+NV/HotW+Vortex/Typhoon] vs. [Smoke Bomb] seems like a fair choice to us. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/492745079140790272))<br />
Roar/Vortex/Typhoon are extremely situational(eg AE DeathGrip). Amp Magic/Smokebomb are used(required) on almost every fight.<br />
NV is useful in every single encounter. Roar is useful in 90+% of encounters. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/492748241167843328))<br />
You think NV is going to be as strong as Amp Magic? I don't think it will be.<br />
Depends on what you stack it with. NV plus Ysera's Gift, or the constant healing of Dream of Cenarius... It adds up. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/492750580654174208))<br />
Small heals dont have the same weight as bulk heals (in most situations). I just feel hybrid cds should be stronger.<br />
For sustained, they may, in Warlords' healing world. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/492753692504772609))<br />

You miss the point, Blood no longer has any choice to it. F/U/D on DS, B on Pes, RP on DC. Thats it.<br />

You guys got &quot;a little&quot; carried away. WoW with Diablo III skills is not a good way to go... Sadly<br />

A nerf to Necrotic Plague doesn't fix the problem of what makes it so attractive. Sorry folks, number tuning isn't going to solve this.<br />

Does the druid claws use the ZG tiger shapeshift graphic? That would be awesome. <br />
No, though both of the ZG Tigons had some sweet looking animations that we wished we could use, but they just weren't... (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/492498891472789504))<br />

Nice, really excited about lunar inspiration and the kiting cat aspect. Opens up a whole new gameplay for feral.<br />
Yeah, Moonfire in Cat Form is actually pretty neat too, I'd say, but it just doesn't have that 'new shininess' to it. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/492500066716753920))<br />

How about Teroclaw and Teroclaw Chick (Mainly the chick!) as Birds of Prey?<br />
Yes! Though considering their story, maybe closer to Carrion birds or... dare I say... raptors? (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/492495895846715392))<br />

wait, where IS ice block. That's one of the iconic spells.<br />
I'm guessing you took Evanesce. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/492115029123035136))<br />
If one takes Evanesce, does one become unable to benefit from Glyph of Regenerative ice?<br />
No, it should work with Evanesce instead (likely at a reduced amount). Not sure if it does, yet. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/492115647791263744))<br />
<br />
are you happy with how prismatic crystal/frost bomb/frozen orb/ice lances interact right now? Crazy combos ensured!<br />
Tentatively. It'd be weird if they didn't interact. Helps make up for the fact that Squirt can't hit the Crystal. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/492396987342278656))<br />
also favoring frost bomb being the best 75 talent when used properly, high skillcap with brain freeze, FoF and squirt timings.<br />
Why would that favor Frost Bomb? All 3 talents on that row do cleave. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/492400273222955008))<br />

1.5s GCD for MW monks, makes me feel so slow, can you explain why? i understand haste will reduce GCD but still.@Celestalon<br />
It's important that haste remain a valuable stat, and so its effects need to be attractive. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/492214029398458368))<br />
Renewing Mist and Uplift are inefficient and weak on 5 targets, when compared single target heals, is this intended?<br />
You're probably looking at the version with the bug where they scale from AP, not SP. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/492224590458802176))<br />

How will a protection paladin deal &quot;slightly less damage &quot;than retribution in WoD when it doesnt have a burst CD ?<br />
They can talent into some cooldowns. And a cooldown alone doesn't make up the difference between a tank and a DPS. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/492210283331325952))<br />

Install time long enough to explain why Void Shift is going away? &gt;.&gt;Please don't take it!<br />
Simply because it was underused, and we are cutting down on cooldowns, and Priests already had enough. Bloat. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/492505356845604864))<br />

Thoughts about Sub Rogue dot snapshotting? Given how it calculates the dot, effects still snapshot trinkets/procs.<br />
Can you clarify what you're talking about? (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/492394085253001216))<br />
Crimson Tempest in particular, when using, appears to still snapshot effects for the duration like on live.<br />
Well, that's not so much snapshotting as the basic design of the skill. There's nothing to be dynamic there. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/492400120617381890))<br />
<br />
Sub will end up using its own version of Affdots due to snapshot synergy with the blade twisting passive on Sinister Calling<br />
It's something that we're concerned about and keeping an eye on. Our hope is that an addon will be pointless, and that all... (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/492496887157489664))<br />

Do you think that lava burst w/ improved lightning shield will be enough to account for no rolling thunder procs thru overload?<br />
No, all the Multistrikes triggering it will. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/492147370306461696))<br />
<br />
Currently see no changes for Shaman mobility in this build, getting worried, anything planned?<br />
Surge and Echo procing at the same time is fine, they don't conflict. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/492512836220776448))<br />
That and Molten Earth can be maintained via Earth Shock alone, which I don't think many are considering.<br />
Yep, Molten Earth is effectively a large buff to mobile damage as well. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/492513430939508737))<br />

So how do we math out on the fly just what sort of procs are needed to eat the debuff and make it worth the cast?<br />
It may sound complex from that description, but there's no &quot;on the fly&quot; math needed, generally. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/492534747537502208))<br />
Either it's better than Soul Fire (damage numbers make that obvious, 0 or 1 stacks), or it's not (only use for burst) (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/492534986319208449))<br />

What about S15 closure? it's been extension of Grevious and feels like it has been a 50 week season since virtually nothing changed<br />
Nothing to share about the end of season 15 but there won't be another season before Warlords. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/492711633949425664))<br />
Holinka last question.. Not a single person likes the Prideful Serpent. Would you ask the Devs to do a color swap for us? Please?<br />

Lore<br />
With so many portals in WoD's story, why don't the Iron Horde just use them to invade Azeroth without the Dark Portal?<br />
They don't have Khadgar. And after the Tanaan intro, they don't have Gul'dan either. (DaveKosak (https://twitter.com/DaveKosak/status/492722474635640833))<br />
<br />
How hard lore wise is it to open a portal from Azeroth to Draenor post expansion launch?<br />
Lore-wise, extremely hard! For gameplay, there are a few in-game. Khadgar mentions how difficult it is. (DaveKosak (https://twitter.com/DaveKosak/status/492723310044532736))<br />
<br />
Is there any in-game lore behind &quot;Claws of Shirvallah&quot;? And if so are these &quot;renegades&quot; inherently evil?<br />
Almost no in-game lore. What do you guys think? Should we create a faction of crazy cat people? (DaveKosak (https://twitter.com/DaveKosak/status/492723513954816000))<br />
<br />
Beyond The Dark Portal, Turalyon and co went to Blade's Edge Mountains(BEM). In WoD BEM's don't exist to my knowledge. Wut?<br />
Blade's Edge was formed when parts of Frostfire crashed into the main continental plate when Draenor exploded. (DaveKosak (https://twitter.com/DaveKosak/status/492722160192864257))<br />
But this was before the explosion, correct me if I'm wrong. <br />
Oh I see what you mean. Same area. You can see a hint of Blade's Edge in the rocks of Frostfire. We just didn't use the name. (DaveKosak (https://twitter.com/DaveKosak/status/492724427964956673))<br />

Oh I would not only ban them from the forums, I would refuse to refund them, ban their ip from all game servers &amp; ban their account(s) in the process. We don't need these kind of people in any game. Weither it is SWTOR, Rift, GW2, WoW, Wildstar or even Final Fantasy. <br />

People should start to respect the devs &amp; understand that as time goes on development takes longer &amp; to be up to a quality standard that those devs preferences.

TBC had 11 leveling instances, WotLK had 10 I think, Cataclysm had 7 but that was for 5 levels. I don't get this when the game is about playing with other players..<br />
<br />
Maybe, just maybe, they want players out in the world instead of in instances?<br />
<br />
I know that the people not caring about questing won't change, but I'd dare wager that's one major argument. Or they just don't have the time to add more dungeons for the leveling content. God knows they seem to have a lot on their plates. <br />
<br />
Hopefully this expansion will see them adding more dungeons not just for max level but for the 90-100 experience as well as patches come out.</div></div><hr />

....Speaking of morans<br />
<br />
This is a perfect example of back feedback or the type of responses blizzard shouldn't entertain for a second. Yes, you may have valid concerns and your input could be very valuable. But instead of providing valuable feedback your only concern is a rage bloated complaint which contains little actual content. It's not about what is right or wrong, its about a personal dislike for Blizzard and dislike for change.<br />
<br />
Apologies for being rude there, but I've little to zero patience for this.</div></div><hr />

What bothers me the most is how even the most bitter and hateful &quot;players&quot; seem to get access, even when they're almost dead set on not playing the game once released...they don't do testing, they're just there to complain and tell everyone that will listen how WRONGED they've been. <br />
Another thing they shouldn't do is give access to people that aren't even subscribed.<br />
<br />
I agree though, they should keep it on the down low so that they wouldn't need to waste time babysitting crybabies. Hell, why not gather data on the most valuable beta players that give tons of GOOD feedback, and let those have a standing invitation for any beta? That'd be entirely cool with me.</div></div><hr />

I agree with you. I was too busy playing wow to spend time reading about the next expansion during BC and LK. But then, BC ended with Sunwell and the implementation of the badge of justice system to gear up, which were cool new things to do in-game. And LK ended with the ICC 5-mans (halion - nahh - he wasn't great). The content drought plus the massive amount of info are combining to stir up the Angry.</div></div><hr />

It is a bit strange. Obviously there are some good beta testers, who are trying lots of classes and trying the zones / testing out PvP, but there seems to be a large number of &quot;testers&quot; that are as you listed above, or they are so tied into their single class that all they do is scream about nerfs to &quot;their&quot; class and how other class is being buffed, or worse you get the closet developer type, who doesn't want to complain about problems, they want to come up with all their own fixes. You see lots of &quot;my idea for level 45 talent&quot; threads, and if a dev doesn't immediately take their ideas and implement them, Blizzard isn't &quot;listening to feedback&quot;.<br />
<br />
Who knows, maybe there is just a high percentage of WoW players who are just a-holes, so any sort of beta is going to get them in there just by default. Personally, I think when they read a forum post that is by someone in beta that is clearly and intentionally spreading falsehoods, they should remove their beta access without a second thought.</div></div><hr />

I'm a noted complainer and SJ enthusiast but I HATE the desire for feminine shapeshifts-- 1) I don't trust Blizzard to get it right and 2) you're shapeshifting into an animal or demon, what do you want, big boobs and eyelashes? If anything I'd like to see a single androgynous form from the get-go like the new Arakkoa, but where we've had a masculine form for years, just keep it-- it's a sexless battle form with big shoulders and no weak points (breasts/genitals). Also, tauren cat form isn't a lion, it's a &quot;panther&quot; like the others, but it has a mane because male AND female tauren HAVE MANES.<br />
<br />
If blizzard is going to do the work to create additional female forms of anything, it should be of NPC races (or they should be androgynous from the beginning, very GJ on the Arakkoa) so that we don't have this mysterious lack of women.<br />

Nothing in this game have ever been hard to master in this game at al and on that same note the ability pruning will ofcourse not make it harder to master it,<br />

Yeah, Bashiok and Muffinius tried that. It went over like a lead balloon; a lot of people probably listened to them and unsubbed.

Actually, don't fully blame the people that do LFR on the prune. For example, one of the biggest &quot;Get rid of mana tide totem because it's a boring ability&quot; people is a heroic raider. <br />

It took 340 replies before anyone from blizzard commented on it, with most of those agreeing with outright lies. It took another hundred before Lore took the time to point by point disprove almost everything the troll was saying. That's not giving attention to a troll, its just making sure people don't spread the troll's misinformation and making sure that their player base knows what is actually happening.</div></div><hr />

If they said nothing, the people like Tent27 above me would criticise them for not replying. The WoW player base is full of dejected people who criticise everything. Sometimes it's deserved, but mostly it's because they're a bunch of whiny, anonymous douche-bags who wouldn't be happy even if WoD was the best ever expansion (I don't think it will be, but it's more to do with over familiarity than anything else these days).</div></div><hr />

Are you kidding? It's during levelling from 90-100. What is wrong with that? Or do you just want to hop on the bank wagon and sound cool? 4 dungeons over a 10 level spread compares favorably with any major mmo on the market. And after level 99, a bunch more + raids open up.<br />

WoD will have the fewest leveling dungeons out of every iteration of the game. MoP had 6. Cata, 7. Wrath, BC, Vanilla had more.<br />
<br />
WoD will not be the first to add dungeons after release, and if they actually do add dungeons later (which is questionable given their track record with this expansion), they would still have fewer dungeons unless they added 2 or more per patch, MoP being the only exception.</div></div><hr />

I'm not going to defend the number, but I'm just going to say that maybe they realize that creating leveling dungeons isn't a very good use of time?

Let's agree to disagree.<br />
<br />
You want Blizzard resources and time spent on 90-99 content. I prefer to see it spent on level 100 content. <br />
<br />
Also, if you haven't figured out by now that you are on the verge of getting more &quot;relevant&quot; dungeon content than ever before via &quot;old dungeon scaling&quot;, then you haven't been paying attention. Think they revamped BFD just for fun? No. Between the leaks, hints, and videos showing the tech in action - its pretty obvious that the big unannounced feature will be dungeon scaling so that you'll soon have more to do than you can handle.</div></div><hr />

Oh yeah, we can disagree. And I hope you're right and that dungeon scaling is going to be the big feature of WoD. That would be awesome. But for now it's not and it's hard to believe they are going to give us more dungeon-ing when they've been taking it away for a few xpacks now.<br />
<br />
As far as blizz devoting resources to 90-99 content. I want them to devote resources to the game. The entire game. This whole notion that if they skimp on the leveling content and other stuff we'll see a lot better end-game content is misguided. We are not getting as much end-game content as we used to. It seems to me (and a lot of people) that their excuse for doing less and less is that they don't want to take time away from other stuff. Is the team smaller? Is the team just not as good? Are they getting too much pressure from above to release and don't have the time? Somehow Blizz is not able to do as much as they used to with the resources they have. We get lots of mounts, and pets, and various levels of the same raid....but not as many dungeons, raids, bosses, etc etc. So it seems as though not spending more resources on other stuff to focus on end-game isn't paying off. IMO</div></div><hr />

Ever since they introduced RDF, dungeon running has become a viable method of leveling when they aren't neutering dungeon XP like in Pandaria. I never level my characters exclusively through questing, and I doubt many people do. Questing just doesn't compare to running dungeons in terms of gameplay. Even before the advent of RDF, Vanilla, BC, and Wrath had many more leveling dungeons than WoD will. <br />
<br />
There's really no legitimate reason for so few leveling dungeons in WoD considering how many dungeons most iterations of WoW have had over the years. This is why people suspect, rightly or wrongly, that Blizz wants to phase out 5 mans or devote very little time to them.<br />
<br />
I honestly don't see how Blizz can be defended on this. 4 leveling dungeons for 10 levels? That's half of what Wrath and BC offered if a little less.<br />
<br />
edit: More leveling dungeons = more level 100 dungeons because they'll be heroics.</div></div><hr />

I have no source for this, but I have a feeling they are trying to change things up to give the illusion that there is more to do at max level. So the &quot;normal&quot; level 100 dungeons will be for &quot;leveling&quot; your newly dinged level 100 character, because Heroics will be much too difficult for 100s in greens, which is why they are requiring players to pass a proving ground. <br />
<br />
While I agree with your edit about heroics, I think they want to have players feel like there's more to do at max level than just start running recycled content (which is how many see heroics). Again, I have no source for that, just a feeling. <br />
<br />
But when it comes to hyperbola of &quot;I honestly don't see how Blizz can be defended on this&quot;, I think you are doing what a lot people do, you are mistaking how you play the game for how 7+ million other people play. You want more leveling dungeons, and that's fine, but that doesn't mean everyone else does. That's not defending Blizzard, that's simply stating a possibility.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The fact that it is 10 levels really doesnÂ´t matter. it is still going to take the same number of hours ( or dungeon runs) to go from 90-100 as it did to go from 85-90... you will just be dinging faster.<br />
<br />
I do agree though, They do so much Â´repeatÂ´ content already, I donÂ´t know why they donÂ´t have ALL of the dungeons be 90-99, then another normal version at 100, then another heroic version. The work to create a dungeon is 90% graphics, and leveling dungeons are always very undertuned anyway ( they donÂ´t need micro-balancing)..</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's one thing to demand more leveling dungeons if they've been keeping parity with past expansions (which they haven't) but entirely something different when they announce a record low number. I'm going to state that it is COMPLETELY outside the realm of possibility that a sizable number of actual players would not be happy with more dungeons. If we have seen a reduction in the amount of leveling through dungeons it is only because Blizzard could be pushing players in a given direction through reduced dungeon numbers and neutered XP gains.<br />
<br />
Five mans bring real gameplay to the game while not bringing the insane time sinks, stress, and performance hits that raids do. There is almost no interaction with other people in questing, there is very little group content, and most of the time you can quest while slapping your willy to BBW porn videos. Scenarios could theoretically offer 5 man style gameplay, as 3 players would permit one person or each role, but they are not set up like that.<br />
<br />
Essentially, questing is a single player experience. 5 mans bring interaction into the game without, as I already said, the baggage that comes with real raiding, therefore, we should have as much 5 man content as possible.</div></div><hr />

Yes, of course, without considering the opportunity cost, most if not all players would like more dungeons. Unfortunately, we don't live in a world with infinite resources. <br />
<br />
If the choice is &quot;more leveling dungeons&quot; v. &quot;more content to do once you hit max level&quot;, I bet most players would favor the latter.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard has taken on considerably more staff for this expansion. They've realized, or want us to think they realize, that WoW is the company's bread and butter, their meat and potatoes. With their additional staff, they should be able to offer both. It's because they have more staff that we're not supposed to be in this false choice scenario any longer. <br />
<br />
There's no good reason for fewer dungeons while having more staff than the previous expansion.</div></div><hr />

Unless they realize that not as many people considering leveling dungeons important as you do. Again, you're problem appears to be that you can't fathom that a large portion of the player base might not share your opinion of what is important. I'm sure they know a lot more about what their player base likes than you or I do. So rather than just assuming that Blizzard as just a-holes and they are intentionally doing this to hurt you, maybe ask yourself what other reasons exist for not making more leveling dungeons.<br />
<br />
I realized a long time ago that what I consider important in WoW is not what everyone wants, so I don't get mad when Blizzard doesn't do everything I want. This is why I don't just play WoW, I play other games as well to fill those niches. If WoW does enough of what I like, I renew my sub and I play until it no longer scratches that itch. Once the game doesn't do enough to keep me interested, I cancel my sub and move on. Personally, for me WoD is doing a lot more right than wrong, so I'm willing to give it a shot. If it doesn't succeed, I'll cancel my sub and not play anymore.</div></div><hr />

I'm assuming, and rightfully so, that Blizzard pursues agendas, and they are not always on the level regarding that.<br />
<br />
Your argument could be applied to anything in this game. The same has been said of the hub issue, of garrisons, of Tanaan, races, everything. &quot;Things don't matter to some people&quot;. It's just excuse making on Blizzard's behalf.<br />
<br />
They've had all this time to work on the expansion, more than the others based on how long we're going to be in SoO. More staff on top of that. Despite all this, it is objective fact that this expansion will contain less of certain kinds of content, at least up front, than previous expansions. It is questionable that they will add what they say they will add later, based on how much trouble they have delivering so far.</div></div><hr />

But I suppose GW2 is hard to master, right?<br />
<br />
It's pretty obvious that not everyone is capable of playing this game, or other games, to the full potential. Sitting e-peening and saying that it's not hard to do that doesn't change facts, that only a VERY few actually manage it.<br />
<br />
This game offers challenges, anyone disputing that is either bitter about not being able to handle them, or trying to spread shit on account of trashing this game. I remember pretty strongly learning how to play my class properly, it didn't come automatically like some would like to pretend.<br />
<br />
Of course, the challenge still doesn't involve more than using a keyboard and a mouse, so in THAT sense it might lack challenge but then again...all games are like that.<br />

They know they're shitting out a sub-par product for $10 more but they can never say it so they have to rabidly defend feeble attempts such as the troll thread to prevent their last players from leaving in droves. Must suck to work there right now.<br />
<br />
Please quit the game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
He didn't explain shit about the most important fact. That they tried to hide the leak on the garrison cash shop. All he said was basically &quot;nuh uh&quot;. That's not explaining, and it did happen.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Siddown</div><div class="date">2014-08-02, 04:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Your argument could be applied to anything in this game. The same has been said of the hub issue, of garrisons, of Tanaan, races, everything. &quot;Things don't matter to some people&quot;. It's just excuse making on Blizzard's behalf.<br />
<br />
I'm hardly making excuses, just raising possibilities. Back at one of the first Blizcons (or maybe the first one), they put out a video that was called something to the effect of &quot;If we listened to the forums&quot; and it was what MC would have looked like if they took all the advice of the forums. The video showed just how silly all the requests coming from players were, and basically it hammered home what would happen to the game if they listed exclusively to the forums.<br />
<br />
All I'm saying is, just because you scream loudly on a non-official forum, it doesn't mean our views represent a large proportion of the actual player bases. I'm not going to argue if they could have done more work or not, all I am saying is that leveling dungeons might not be as important to everyone else as it is to you. If you want to get faux angry about it, or worse, get really angry about it, that's entirely up to you. <br />
<br />
You call that &quot;pursing an agenda&quot;, I call that building software. It's harder than you think.</div></div><hr />

Not for me, I rarely touch dungeons whilst levelling, but I know plenty of people like to level that way. I don't really see any of the other complaints as actually being problematic. I couldn't give a shit where the faction base is, for instance.<br />
<br />
Not nearly as concerning as the use of &quot;whilst&quot; it turns out</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, because this game isn't just about instances.</div></div><hr />

&gt;Implying people will do anything other than quest and power level to 100 before running any instances</div></div><hr />

<br />
Slamming through instances with a guild group can be fun and effective for leveling. Especially when its really all the same quests as always, kill, fetch, escort.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
TL:DR - I'm ignoring everything and will experience the game myself</div></div><hr />
