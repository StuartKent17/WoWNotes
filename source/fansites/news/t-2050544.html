I think it's pretty damned fantastic if they've FINALLY abandoned the &quot;quicker expansions!!&quot;-mentality forced upon them by players with the mentality of fat kids eating cake. <br />
<br />
<br />

I don't know, MoP was pretty damned tight up until SoO lasting 14 months... and it still had a pretty damned fine retention power.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've heard that before, I'll believe it when I see it.<br />
In WoD the idea was to rush expansions to not have content drought (1 year expansions). But legion turned to be pretty big and they don't want to cut content from it to close the content drought gap in WoD. This time around content patches are in priority and next expansion not so much.</div></div><hr />

Being cynical to the point where nothing they say gets you excited is not something to aspire to in my book. <br />

Well the trailer showing demons rushing towards the instance is a pretty good indicator. They've done re-works before with bosses in the same places but still different you know.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaleredar</div><div class="date">2016-08-17, 08:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Content droughts don't crop up at the beginning of expansions, they crop up at the end... <br />
<br />
<br />
Cataclysm had three raids out the gate with a bunch of challenging heroic dungeons, which was then followed up by the two troll heroics and then firelands shortly afterwards. But then Dragon Soul slogged on forever.<br />
<br />
Mists of Pandaria started with three raids as well and had a bunch of daily quest activities to do, followed by a massive Throne of Thunder patch with even more dailies. And then the patch that was just the barrens event and Siege of Orgrimmar dragged on forever. <br />
<br />
<br />
Far be it from me to tell Blizzard how to plan their content, but I'd think it'd always do them well to err on the side of delaying the initial content patches after launch (especially because they can hotfix in balance changes now) to help meter out the inevitable content droughts at the end of the expansion. <br />
<br />
The perfect example is Ulduar. Ulduar was only out for 14 weeks when ToC was released. Not only did lots of people not get to progress adequately in Ulduar, but that truncated amount of time both extended the amount of time we were in TOC AND in ICC. Now, luckily, ICC was a well recieved raid and everyone loved the Lich king, but the point still stands.</div></div><hr />

They've done many wrongs, but people seem to forget the other expansions (MoP in particular) because they can't see further than beyond their noses (WoD). <br />
<br />
I'm all for being skeptical, but people on MMO-C are not displaying a HEALTHY dose of skepticism. More like a mob mentality to latch onto anything negative (or even just POSSIBLY negative) and cirklejerk around it.</div></div><hr />

They didn't promise anything. They said that it's important, which implies that they're going to try to make sure it's not a problem. <br />

Probably something that uses assets from Maw of Souls or Hall of Valor. It's suppose to tie up loose ends in Stormheim before we actually go into Nighthold. I'd assume the raid would only be four bosses max, but it could be something akin to Throne of Four Winds, or an Onyxia style one and done.<br />
<br />
As far as Karazhan goes it's obvious not going to be exactly the same. Probably think ZG in terms of how they are probably going to change it.<br />
<br />
There are 12 encounters in current Karazhan, although they didn't outright say they would be the same 9 encounters. I'd assume they would remove chess, animal bosses, but not sure who they would remove as another boss if they stuck to the original 12 encounters (Nightbane?).</div></div><hr />

<br />
it didn't change, it's the exact same release schedule as WoD, you get EN first (Highmaul), then after months, you get NH (Blackrock Foundry) only this time we will be getting a 5 man dungeon (kara) and a small raid before Highmaul is released to tie up a storyline. Sounds like buckets of content to me, they just are delaying NH liket hey did BRF in WOD...they actually released BRF too soon, so this seems like a good plan, a 5 man plus a small raid to keep peeps busy before NH is released.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The trash mobs and channelers right before Mag are all categorized as &quot;boss level&quot; mobs by their level identifier. I think it's actually closer to 20 mobs in that place categorized like that. The ones in old Kara are obviously all bosses though with the exception of the beast things on the first floor that are loosely defined as bosses.</div></div><hr />

I'm not saying everything Blizzard does is great, there has been lots of decisions that I def. don't agree with and the content draughts in the past are still a close memory. But we haven't seen anything apart from this trailer so far and have no idea what the instance actually looks like. Can't we just wait and see? Maybe it's gonna be really good. <br />

Maybe it's gonna be bad and just rehashed and barely updated. Possible, but if that's the case I'll be annoyed at that after I've first cleared it myself and not months in advance.</div></div><hr />

I don't get this BRF was released too soon....Highmaul was seven fricken bosses...HFC was released too soon yes...but not BRF.

<br />
that's not my opinion, sorry. That's what THEY said about WoD's release structure, that it was released a bit too soon. I personally felt it was right on time, but they didn't have content for shit so holding would've been suicide. At least this time they can hold off with more stuff for us to do. Either way, the delayed release is the same, that was the point of the reply.<br />

could be adjusted? Who knows, but they did it in MoP with MSV and HoF....so this isn't exactly new things we are experienced, i'm surprised people are still surprised at this point that content gets released like this.</div></div><hr />

<br />
because emerald nightmare and nighthold are all part of the same &quot;tier&quot; of content, only difference is we won't be having this fucked up &quot;one instance drops worse loot than the other&quot; situation again, while the overall ilvl of EN may be lower than NH, they all have the same &quot;POTENTIAL&quot; ilvl across all difficulties.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Is it canon that we have already rummaged through Kara? If so, why/how<br />
is Moroes still alive? We killed him. Even Undead can die, and its not like<br />
there would be anyone around to revive him.<br />
<br />
Karazhan is a very messed up place, even without the Sargeras influence. Hell Moroes was killed by the Sargeras controlled Medivh along with the cook in one of the books. But the magic of that place brought him back to life to serve, not to mention that time flows differently there. You get glimpses of the past and the future. Though with the Legion barging in we might be seeing echo versions of the bosses. Spirits, undead, who knows I am hyped so long as they fix Chess.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Tier is an entire raid cycle, example, 5.0 MSV/HOF/TOES were one tier, 4.0 BWD/TO4W/BOT were a tier. In WoD, the first tier was HM and BRF, despite people thinking BRF was seperate. Obviously they won't open both EN and NH at the same time since that would make EN redundant. The 7.1 raid will be a filler with gear between EN and NH ilvl, it will still be considered the same raid tier though.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Ensuring there is always content in the live game while working on the expansions is important.&quot;<br />

i can not comprehend how it took them 8 years to realize this. yeah the reader of mmo champion can be entertained by beta updates for the 15 months they ignored the live game but everyone else just unsubbed<br />

Until it happens, it's nothing but pandering talk. Like you say, they've been saying the same crap for YEARS yet the only thing we've seen from them is drought after drought with content that barely lasts 2 months let alone 5. <br />
<br />
Their last comment of &quot;Don't worry, we got you.&quot; in regards to end of expansion &quot;There won't be a content drought&quot; made me laugh, because it is, besides the modern lingo, the exact thing they've been saying since WotLK, yet we have seen, time and time again, massive droughts. <br />

For a game of WoW's size Blizzard is honestly trying their hardest. If you don't like where the game has gone or is going then just unsubscribe and don't come back. Otherwise just be happy with what you are getting and play the game like its meant to be played. I, for one, am excited about getting a revamped Karazhan. I never played BC while it was current but just running it for the pets and mount lets me see why its such a beloved raid. I love everything about Legion that we are getting, the demon hunters, artifact weapons, more lore and story on Illidan who is my favorite character in the game. As far as the &quot;This time there won't be a content drought.&quot;, from what I understand they have completely scrapped the idea of releasing a new expansion every year because they realized that it doesn't help with live content because live content doesn't get any attention compared to the expansion they are working on. So all I can say about it is we will have to wait and see but I honestly think they will do it this time just by looking at what's to come in patch 7.1.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That undead guy is Moroes, Medivhs gentlemens gentlemen (or Butler in the US)<br />
<br />
He was killed by Medivh when Sargeras took full control over him towards the end of the Last Guardian novel. By BC, Moroes is forced to live forever in undeath, even if he is killed (as seen in WoD where he shows up in your inn or tarven to hand out dailies). The master could be Medivh, who hasn't been seen since WC3</div></div><hr />

That's not how it works. You can't throw more people at a project and expect things to be done faster or get more content out of it. In fact having to communicate between individuals and teams is the biggest botteneck when it comes to realising a product in development.<br />

While you're right that the Nighthold doesn't launch at the same time as Nightmare, it's not going to be spaced out that far either. Nighthold is in the 7.0 launch, but simply unlocks at another time.</div></div><hr />

Not in terms of a &quot;content drought&quot;, in terms of actual content delivered throughout the expansion and RETENTION rate as a result. People act as if WoD has snuffed out all the other expansions.<br />
<br />
We already have 7.1 up on the table, before the expansion even launched, and people still find ways to whine... Although from what I've seen, many of those complaining the most about &quot;content droughts&quot; rarely have anything to show for their supposedly quick consumption of content in-game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
SO! My idea! What if, as long as the city is under invasion (could be part of a patch), INSTEAD Gilneas would be used as the alliance capital? I mean, Genn have a huge focus in this expansion. And the city is pretty much unused right now, right? So why not? It would be really cool! They could clean up the city and sorta have it be used as an stand in for the time being.<br />
<br />
Then when the legion is stopped in Stormwind (could be a raid or scenario like the Broken Shore), and then the city would return as the main capital. Then Gilneas could just be used as another city people could use.<br />

I think it would be cool!</div></div><hr />

Idd, it won't be a case of &quot;retune for 110 and go&quot;. I'm sure we'll see new models, new mechanics (let's face it, they're horribly outdated in the raid) and all that jazz. They said in the interview today with Slootbag that Karazhan is important for storytelling in Legion, and they'd better do the legacy of that raid justice.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's clear that they were developing this content patch at the same time as the new expansion. Hence why it will be going on the PTR right when Legion releases.<br />
<br />
The optimistic side of me thinks they've already got a head start developing the future patches to be released throughout Legion's life cycle so they won't be caught with their trousers down when the community is burnt out on the current content. <br />
<br />
It's the only explanation as to why we had HFC for 14 months.</div></div><hr />

It's certainly more promising than empty words because we have something to go on that's tangible. I see it as a way of showcasing that they're already working on it. Whether or not that means it's released on time or with everything is always up in the air, but it's like seeing the Ulduar patch before WotLK is even released.</div></div><hr />

What the hell?! Is this a joke? It's not a content patch if it's content we already have... I would have bet money that Kara would have been different somehow. This is stupid.<br />
<br />
And yet we had Patch 4.1 that turned Zul Gurub and Zul Aman both raids into 5 mans and they were accepted as content and this no different.. Or would you rather that they make Patch 7.1 a S.E.L.F.I.E 2.0 patch instead?<br />
<br />

<br />
At least it's more than the selfie camera!<br />

Very true indeed, they could of done that instead at least this time it is something more than what 6.1 was which is not really that hard when you think about it.. :D</div></div><hr />

When did they rush an expansion? They've all been two years. One right after the other and many of them have had very long content delays. What the hell are they talking about?<br />
<br />
So should we assume from this that the next expansion will be three years from now or more? That's the only logical conclusion to this truly weird claim. <br />
<br />
All anyone can conclude is that in recent years they take a long time to create any content and they will continue to be slow to produce content. I find it hard to believe that we won't continue to have year long content droughts. The only difference is we will, in the future, have fewer expansions.</div></div><hr />

Fourth. Wrath, Cata, MoP and WoD. Vanilla and BC droughts weren't super bad.<br />
<br />
there were actually no droughts during vanilla and TBC. Hell there were shit tons of ppl never stepped in to Naxxaramas or Sunwell. İf anything they could have easyly delayed Tbc and Wrath roughly 3 more months.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JuanFiles</div><div class="date">2016-08-18, 01:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So quick Lore question :<br />
<br />
Is it canon that we have already rummaged through Kara? If so, why/how<br />
is Moroes still alive? We killed him. Even Undead can die, and its not like<br />
there would be anyone around to revive him.<br />
<br />
<br />
In Warlods of Draenor, Moroes appear in our garrison Inn as a quest giver. He does complain of the mess we did last time we went into Karazhan and how long it took him to clean up the mess and he is still cleaning... So he asks us to get him some acid he needs to make a super cleaner.<br />
<br />
So, it seems to me that the events that happened in Kara are, in fact, cannon. He aknowledges we were in there, we did stumble tru the tower and did a mess. As of him being alive.. Well... He is an undead and his spirit is anchored to Karazhan, just like many others. So if you want an explanation, i think is pretty simple. Even tho we defeated him, that dosent mean he wasnt able to stand up again after, lets say, some recovery time :P <br />
<br />
Now id like to say, to all those people bitching about &quot;re-used&quot; content, that many of us been asking for this very thing... that's it... a reazon to go back to Karazhan. The revamp of the Deadmines was one of the best, the dungeon didn't change, just the story did move foward. Scholomance revamp was a failure cause they did cut so much of it that it did not feel the same at all. Perhaps Scholo was not the best choice to revamp. Scarlet Monstery was neither a success, but is not as bad as Scholo.<br />
<br />
Also don't forget we are not losing the original Karazhan, it is still there. This new dungeon will contain new bosses im sure, with obvious come backs as Moroes, and i'm willing to bet, there wont be a chess event (lulz) and Hopefuly Malchezaar too will be back, but not as final boss. I'd like to see someone bigger that is behind this, a bigger demon that is right now giving orders to Malchezaar, that would be amazing! Anyway lets wait and see. After all, this is NOT a revamp, is a new dungeon, inside the tower we do love. And the old thing, will still be there!</div></div><hr />

Naxx at the end of Vanilla and Sunwell at the end of Tbc still end up with many ppl not even stepping in to them. Cata, MoP and WoD had the most significant droughts overall. And they were also around time when Blizz said focus switched on to faster expansions and still failed to deliver 3 expansion in a row. That was my point. Even if you conseder Naxx and Sunwell as droughts , this makes the failure 10 years straight</div></div><hr />

I think Vanilla is the only one that didn't have a content drought because they released TBC so quickly. I think a few months after KT died.<br />
<br />
Black temple was then out for 9 months before Sunwell came along. So Blizzard haven't released 1 expac without a content drought, on the other hand if the raid is good I don't really mind it.<br />
<br />
I don't mind a raid/patch to last 9 months so long as there's still things to do.<br />
