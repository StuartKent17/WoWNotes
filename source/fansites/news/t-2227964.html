Legion PvP Season 3 Ending June 13!<br />
Tomb of Sargeras and Class Mounts (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/6265-Patch-7-2-PTR-Build-23436-Class-Mount-Models) will be coming soon, as well as the new PvP season!<br />
The time is nearly at hand to bring Legion PvP Season 3 to a close for all Arena and Battleground competitors.<br />
<br />
Season 3 – End of Season Rewards<br />
If you participated in Season 3, to ensure you receive the rewards that you’re due, please keep the following in mind:<br />
<br />
<br />
Refrain from transferring your character(s) to another realm or faction until after Legion Season 3 has ended.<br />
Legion Season 3 titles and mounts will be awarded approximately two weeks after the season ends.<br />
<br />
<br />
Faction-Based Rewards<br />
Don’t forget—end-of-season rewards are based on your faction. If you transfer your character to the other faction, you must have 150 wins after your transfer to receive the reward.<br />
<br />
When the dust settles, where will you stand this season?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah forgot we in 3rd now, they shortened them up quite a bit. Point still stands. 2nd season ended/3rd started with 7.2 so you really can't go by shit of a PvP season start or end. Could drop 7.2.5 same day, maybe not, maybe ToS same day, maybe not, really all up in the air.<br />
<br />
I really think it will be staggered but not sure which will come first, I think ToS then a few weeks to 7.2.5, not on a release build on ptr yet, and that usually sits for a week or two before live.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I mean yea 7.2.5 could be the 20th, but then I'd assume TOS will be July 11th, It would really be stupid on Blizzards part to release TOS normal/heroic on the 27th and they won't release 7.2.5 with all the class changes the same day as the raid...they didnt do it with NH and they wont do it with TOS. So my guess is to save themselves from working overtime during the 4th of july week they will just push TOS to the 11th, which would overall make much more sense...</div></div><hr />

Mythic will be unlocked the week after as well as LFR giving them 2 weeks of &quot;hotfixing&quot; before the Mythic Race begins which is exactly what they did for NH and 7.1.5.</div></div><hr />

7.1.5 was released on Jan 10th.<br />
Nighthold was released on Jan 17th ... 1 week after.<br />
Mythic/LFR was released on Jan 24th<br />
<br />
So 1 week for normal/heroic, 2 weeks for Mythic/LFR.</div></div><hr />

HFC launched on the 23rd of June (Mythic on the 30th). People used the exact same argument back then.</div></div><hr />

It will completely screw up the hotfixing but they won't care. They need Tomb out before the end of the quarter to boost their revenue/played hours number in the Shareholder's announcement.<br />
<br />
So, they will do the same as always: Rush out unfinished, untested content that will then not be hotfixed because of the holiday.<br />
<br />
The whole crap about releasing a major class-changing patch a week before Raid release is infuriating. Some of the classes will be majorly overhauled, so you need to &quot;learn&quot; a new playstyle and possibly even switch specs while progressing...</div></div><hr />

Yes, if you look at the sets under collections in-game, you'll see the appearance says &quot;Season 3 and 4&quot;. Plus, the appearance comes from Tomb of Sargeras which isn't even out yet, so it wouldn't make sense for them to pick a different appearance.</div></div><hr />

Untested? They've been doing tests on ToS and 7.2.5 for quite a while now. That is why it is called the &quot;PTR&quot; Public Test Realm &lt;----since you seem to be a noob and don't know that they spend months testing before any release.<br />

lol!!! That is because of X-mas and new years, dude. You trying to compare December to July? You can't look at one patch that was released in Dec and then assume that they will follow the same formula in July. lol<br />

Why do Americans think that because of a singular day holiday it's going to compound into extreme effort on Blizzards part? It's the 4th of July. A holiday only the United States celebrates for only a single day. I'd be more worried about Thanksgiving or Christmas changing when 7.2.5 is released long before the 4th.<br />

Considering the raid is the only worthwhile piece of story content we'll be getting in the entirety of 7.2&amp;7.2.5, I'd say yeah. It is about the only exciting thing. Oh and the Chromie scenario they could have released a month ago so everyone could stop being woefully bored.<br />

You should do some counseling for your anger issues.<br />

<br />
American's think that because it's a very popular week to take off for vacation in America, and last I checked Blizzard is an American company. Yes they released mythic HFC close to the 4th of July and it was an absolute headache for them. I wouldn't be surprised if it came out before, nor would I be surprised if it came out after.<br />
