<br />
No it isn't. Since it's an on-use affect, I doubt it would count to your mount collection. Plus there is absolutely no reason why a guild would let anybody other than a caster get this.<br />
<br />
Also, if this is unfair, then I demand that Paladins and Warlocks have their mounts made available to everybody.</div></div><hr />

It felt pretty lame as a caster to never have even a chance at Shadowmourne either. This makes up for having--up until this point--nothing.</div></div><hr />

Get in a good guild put in the solid effort and you get one easy 1EE-12 of players don't kid yourself, so far every caster that can log on has the first stage of this quest, sorry either you suck or the ppl you raid with suck and can't kill firelands trash.

<br />
Well technically didn't those that got shadowmourne get a chance at a mount, funky tabard, portal , and other vanity items? Sure some guilds might not let them keep all the items, some guilds did, some got to pick at least one.<br />
<br />
Folks that get this legendary don't get all those vanity items shadowmourne folks got!<br />
<br />
I won't ever get this staff so it makes no odds to me, I actually think it's a nice thing that they are giving even more awesomeness to a legendary than what we have had before.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think it's 280% normally what &quot;Very Fast&quot; stands for, 310% normally is &quot;Extremely Fast&quot; most people got 'Breaking the Sound Barrier (310% Speed)' which counts for all flying mounts now, mount is probably standard epic speed (280%)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Warriors http://images1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb38634/common/skins/common/blank.gif (http://www.wowwiki.com/index.php?title=Patch_1.6.0&amp;action=edit&amp;section=18) <br />

<br />
Except the mount was a reward from something that was BoE. Guilds often split the things between them. The wielder did not get to keep everything in most cases. But for the staff, the mounts can only be used by the wielder. So don't call people &quot;fuckin dumbasses&quot; if you don't know what you are talking about.</div></div><hr />

Find it funny that people are complaining about it being an edit of the standard drake. Before today it didn't even have an on-use mount, now it has one it's not good enough!!!<br />
Oh and so what if it's got a nice looking mount that only some people can get. My main's a Paladin, we can get a class unique mount for like 10g now. Druids can now train swift flight form, but having to do a huge questline and no doubt spend a lot of gold on this legendary is unfair. <br />
Special things like this add flavor to the game I think.</div></div><hr />

This isnt the final legendary. Its not even the final one this xpac. Relax, take your head out of your ass, and most importantly learn to use your brain. The next legendary will surely be at least as cool as this one and likely even cooler. Look forward to that instead of ruining the experience people like myself who have played almost 6 years and finally are about to get a legrndary.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I 100% agree. I got the Glaive set in BC, and now they are useless other than something cool to look at. It's a smack in the face to all those who had to work so hard and wait so long for their legendary weapon, to just be useless then next expansion, now everyone who gets this staff gets to have a permanent item in the dragon mount.

<br />
Right. Farming a boss that was part of natural progression and hoping for a drop is totally comparable to the &quot;hard work&quot; and effort that goes into making legendaries now a days.<br />

Well, my issue with it is that the mount aspect of the staff really isn't interesting or neat at all, imo. It's a pretty cool looking mount, but we have SO many mounts in WoW right now I just don't see a reason to give us another one, especially one that isn't 100% original( say what you will, it is still an reskin). My initial reaction was, &quot;Really? Another mount?&quot; Feels like yet another cop out and an aversion from using resources.<br />

Patch 4.2 introduces an epic quest that will challenge those daring enough to complete the legendary staff Dragonwrath, Tarecgosa's Rest. The great staff duplicates destructive magics, and also bestows upon its wielder the ability to transform into a member of the Blue Dragonflight. Those who complete the staff won’t be the only ones to receive a reward, though. As this task requires the dedication of an entire guild, upon completion of the staff all guild members will receive a unique non-combat pet to call their own. this msg board wont let me post a link, but go look it up, that's a direct quote.</div></div><hr />

To be fair they did get a mount from the end of the Shadowmourne quest, but its BoE, and a ground mount, and looks dumb especially if your a DK.</div></div><hr />

Its a Staff, that has a on use effect to be a mount. It almost certainly will not go into our mount spellbook, as that would &quot;spend&quot; the item, much like a normal mount and we would have to lose it from our inventory. To use the mount we would have to have the Staff equipped. So I imagine you'll not be seeing too many of them come 4.3, or as soon as the Staff loses its BiS status. Stop crying. There are mounts available to most classes in the game that aren't available to everybody. Get the fuck over it.</div></div><hr />

Atiesh, Greatstaff of the Guardian: Creates a portal to Karazhan for the group... (not interesting anymore, but for those who had it in TBC, nice trick...)<br />
<br />
Dragonwarth Tarecgosa's Rest: Transforms you in a cool mount...<br />
<br />
Interesting trend of adding a effect that would keep the caster legendaries &quot;useful&quot; even after the weapon itself is no longer useful anymore due to be lower ilvl/older content...<br />
<br />
Don't remember any other with that &quot;perk&quot;... the closest thing to that would be the Shadowmourne rewards... that are Bind on Use...<br />

Well technically didn't those that got shadowmourne get a chance at a mount, funky tabard, portal , and other vanity items? Sure some guilds might not let them keep all the items, some guilds did, some got to pick at least one.<br />
<br />
Folks that get this legendary don't get all those vanity items shadowmourne folks got!<br />
<br />
I won't ever get this staff so it makes no odds to me, I actually think it's a nice thing that they are giving even more awesomeness to a legendary than what we have had before.<br />

There is alread a nice pet that you get after completing the staff (and also the guild).</div></div><hr />

I'm just tired of this superficial crap. TDB used to be funny. Anyway, that's my own opinion, so don't cry too much.<br />
<br />
On the staff turning players into mounts, well, that was coming, wasn't it? They started the trend of offering more than just stats and damage in vanilla with Mediev's staff, stoped in TBC and the begining of WotLK, came back to it with Shadowmourne, and now elevated the rewards again. I believe they gave the staff this bonus instead of offering Shadowmourne style of bonuses because the guy making the effort of gathering the mats and spending allot of money didn't actually get 100% for his work. You had people who wanted the tabard, mount, then you had people that wanted to sell those for impossible amounts, and in the meantime this created allot of useless, unwanted drama in many guilds. This was a very elegant way of stopping all that BS from happening. And for the people that are crying because they don't get yet another re-skin of the bronze drake, tough luck, better quickly re-roll to get a re-skin right? Jesus Christ.<br />

It's most likely not going to count as a mount collection. Not only that, but for you &quot;mount collectors&quot; out there that are complaining about the fairness, you know that getting to the final stage of this legendary is not going to be fast or easy, right? It's going to take months of grinding/wiping in Firelands. Go find other easier mounts to get (unless you have them all, then find something else to ride because this mount isn't nearly as cool as some of the mounts already out).<br />
<br />
Pretty sick of hearing melee dps complaining about the &quot;fairness&quot; of this weapon too. You've already had shadowmourne, thunderfury, and glaives. This is the first caster legendary. Let us have our moment. If you want to look at an orange piece in your weapon slot so badly, just go run TK. Problem solved.<br />

I know a ton of people that still have level 70 legendaries. and i know someone that used the legendary from Ulduar all of wrath for healing because it was still the best. also for those QQin about the mount only going to casters look at other mounts that only certain classes can get. paladins can get 2 charger mounts, their mount and the one from the argent dawn. locks have their own mount and druids turn into a damn bird yet no one is crying about that.</div></div><hr />

The long time players know that this is not the first nor the last legendary so they just go about raiding as usual. The noobs on the other hand wine constantly about how they are not getting it despite the fact that if they did their research they would know that they had a chance for a legendary in the past and now it's casters turn. So next time you hear someone wine about how they are not getting the legendary, you will know that obviously that person is a noob if they do not know the history of something as common knowledge as the legendaries.</div></div><hr />

Thats a little different actually the mount came from the Gift box you get in the end of the chain and the items were BOE<br />
<br />
and some guilds actually distributed those items in the guild or even put them on the AH &gt;_&gt;<br />
you really needed to get lucky with a generous guild if you were allowed to keep all the items. <br />
<br />
With the staff its build in so the one that wields it will get the mount too.<br />
but i like the pet edition however does this mean that only the guildies that are present get the pet or the whole Guild?<br />
what i am asking basically does the pet get added to the guild vendor?<br />
<br />
I don't really mind it but I just hope for the next legendaries they keep something similar up.</div></div><hr />

Never going to happen, because Blizzard hates druids and they will never have a legendary based on one spec.</div></div><hr />

Now whole guild puts effort into getting one, but only the wielder gets to use a mount. Like the weapon itself isn't rewarding enough.</div></div><hr />

3 specs. kitty and bear are 2 different specs, and with reforging, it's viable for both.</div></div><hr />
