<br />
You're right no movie ever releases a teaser</div></div><hr />

<br />
So what you are saying is showing more than one trailer is somehow paradoxically less footage?<br />
<br />
Also teaser trailers aren't new things.<br />
<br />
Afraid*</div></div><hr />

And how did he mount while moving? Only mages can do that, in fact didn't they hotfix it so even mages can't now? Someone should report King Laine.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's called a teaser - Like how Star wars had about 3 teasers before the full trailer. Get with the times dude and learn to spell - can't even troll correctly.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jester Joe</div><div class="date">2015-11-03, 04:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">trailer for a trailer...really? is this movie really that bad they are affraid to show more than 15 sec of it?<br />
<br />
And here I thought this would at least end the complaints about how the armor looks from unfinished images...<br />
<br />
If they're &quot;so afraid&quot; to show it, why would they even have the trailer being released on Friday? It's just a different way for them to advertise that the trailer is coming out Friday while giving a slight taste of what to expect. Sure, it's funny to laugh at it being a trailer for a trailer, but leaping from that to bashing is equally silly.</div></div><hr />

Literally every fucking film released these days does the same. You're either a troll or an idiot.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yep, it's now the industry standard. Normally we get an announcement the day before the teaser that it's coming, even</div></div><hr />

<br />
teaser trailers are pretty common<br />
<br />
I'm not really a warcraft fan so I haven't been excited about a movie about it. However, I thought this teaser was pretty good.</div></div><hr />

Ya it looks like it than after that they go to War &amp; than we know how it ends. I'm thinking Varian's Mother survives with everyone that escapes Stormwind.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
So, I guess the places we see are Hinterlands, 3 Stormwinds, then Arathi, Blasted Lands, Dun Morogh, Swamp of Sorrows, and then I'm lost.<br />
<br />
We will prbly not see Hinderlands until a 2nd movie that is 2nd War.</div></div><hr />

That's not a bad thing lol, it is still orcs vs humans after all why not make it look like the best film of that type? could do a hell of a lot worse.<br />

The First War was only Humans, Some Elves &amp; maybe some Dwarves Vs the Orcs &amp; some Ogres. This isn't a WoW movie, it is Orcs Vs Humans Warcraft 1.</div></div><hr />

But look at that building :( It screams CGI. So fake. I wouldn't be surprised if not a single piece of the set was actually build and everything you see is green screen stuff. You can just see the characters being pasted into it. The lighting, the shadows, it all just looks... off...<br />

All but the undead predate the Orc's arrival, but they weren't big world players. The Undead were created by the Legion who weren't interested in Azeroth until the Orcs came through the Dark Portal.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Based on the looks of him, I'd wager that the character on right is actually Antonidas and not Khadgar. He didn't have a role in the original game, but could be something changed for the movie.<br />
<br />
Also for the ones complaining about the CGI quality, remember that things like this can change still before the release. See for example the Guardians of the Galaxy trailer http://imgur.com/a/jMj5h#0</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's the lighting on the people compared to the backdrop. As someone who does some Photoshop work, I recognized it immediately.<br />
<br />
Look at the direction of the light on the castle behind them. It's (the sun) coming from the upper right, behind the camera. It should be hitting the king in the face as he's looking upward.<br />
<br />
Now look at the people. They have a sheen of light behind them, and it looks like it's hitting them more from behind and to the right, placing the light source in front of the camera (though still high off screen). This would suggest that the primary light source on most of the people is actually coming from the opposite direction. This is especially noticeable on the front right soldier, who's helmet is actually shaded in the direction (front right) that the sun should be hitting him.<br />
<br />
I don't do any work in visual effects, but I would assumed that making sure the light matches up would be a 101 class on the subject. Kind of surprised that they'd screw something like that up, as the human eye will immediately perceive it as &quot;fake&quot; or &quot;wrong&quot;, even if you can't figure out why. The best guess I could make is that perhaps when they shot the scene they were planning on a different backdrop, of that that it was changed during the course of production and they couldn't go back and re-shoot. Perhaps the CGI guys felt that the castle backdrop simply looked better with light shining on it despite the fact that it wouldn't match up with the people in front of it.</div></div><hr />

The irony of course is that full CGI is what most people really wanted. It's understandable. One of the two ways you solve the problem of making CGI creatures and scenery look realistic is to make everything CGI, including the humans, so there's no noticeable compositing. Which is the problem with a couple of these scenes.<br />
<br />
So, what's really funny, and this is something I actually kind of feared might happen, is that I think the full CGI scenes with orcs actually look more realistic than the ones with people in them. But apart from the sloppy compositing in the scenes with Stormwind Keep, which is much less noticeable in motion, I think everything actually looks really solid. And there's still a shitload of post production time that should allow them to clean up some of those rough edges.</div></div><hr />

There will be some warlocks (Gul'dan for example) and mages (Khadgar, Medivh). Night elves and tauren are still at Kalimdor when this takes place so no druids. Keep in mind that lore-wise there are fewer mages and warlocks then there are ordinary soldiers, so don't expect that there will be mages as much as footmen.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That archmage, his clothes look very similar to those of Antonidas :p<br />
<br />
From his wiki:<br />
<br />
''Before the Second War, leaders of each of the Azerothian nations met in Lordaeron to discuss the threat of the orc invasion. Archmage Antonidas attended the summit on behalf of the Council of Six, pledging loyalty to the Alliance on Dalaran's behalf. He also monitored the progress of the young but extremely talented mage Khadgar, who had served as Medivh's apprentice during the first war. In the aftermath of the Second War, Antonidas promoted Khadgar to the rank of archmage and placed him in a position of authority over the mission to enter the Dark Portal and investigate Draenor.''<br />
<br />
Meaning he was in Lordaeron prior to the orc invasion, the timing lines up perfectly, my money is on him being Antonidas for sure.</div></div><hr />

I never expected there to be more mages than foot soldiers, but at least you answered me rationally, instead of just reminding me it's a teaser - because that explains everything, of course. I'm just saying I realized what's missing for me - spell casters are my favorite class, magic is one of the defining features of the franchise, and we haven't seen much of it yet - but, oh, that's explained by &quot;It's a teaser&quot;. Well, why didn't you tell me! Of course, mages can't be in teasers!<br />

<br />
I'm excited for this movie, as long as I have fun watching it, its a success for me. And usually you don't build grandiose sets like the one they built for Stormwind unless you had plans to use it for more than 1 movie. So I'd imagine they will plow ahead with a sequel if they even break even on this one. Which I think they will.<br />
<br />
The Blizzard PR machine is hard to underestimate, they have many avenues and resources for this. Plus this movie internationally will do well given the fanbase of all their games is global.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They are actually goingin the right direction. Of course they are in fact parallel, but there is this thing going on in our perception of vision called perspective that actually makes parallels ultimately seem to intersect in one point.<br />
<br />
The reason the scene looks so bad (yes it does nobody can deny it) is the weird shadows under the people sitting on the benches. They are floating above the scene on a different Photoshop layer, instead of sitting on a bench that is placed on the pavement.<br />

I am pretty sure that will be fixed though, because it really does look atrocious right now and considering the names being signed under this project, this will surely not go through.</div></div><hr />

They are actually goingin the right direction. Of course they are in fact parallel, but there is this thing going on in our perception of vision called perspective that actually makes parallels ultimately seem to intersect in one point.<br />
<br />
The reason the scene looks so bad (yes it does nobody can deny it) is the weird shadows under the people sitting on the benches. They are floating above the scene on a different Photoshop layer, instead of sitting on a bench that is placed on the pavement.<br />

I think most of this is post rendering for the trailer, I can't imagine it will look like this on big screen theatres.</div></div><hr />

I was flashing back to something more like the Dungeons and Dragons movie. Really hoping they do the story justice and it's not just a loose chain of action sequences and cheesy special effects. <br />
<br />
The hype is real :/</div></div><hr />

<br />
From his wiki:<br />
<br />
''Before the Second War, leaders of each of the Azerothian nations met in Lordaeron to discuss the threat of the orc invasion. Archmage Antonidas attended the summit on behalf of the Council of Six, pledging loyalty to the Alliance on Dalaran's behalf. He also monitored the progress of the young but extremely talented mage Khadgar, who had served as Medivh's apprentice during the first war. In the aftermath of the Second War, Antonidas promoted Khadgar to the rank of archmage and placed him in a position of authority over the mission to enter the Dark Portal and investigate Draenor.''<br />
<br />
Meaning he was in Lordaeron prior to the orc invasion, the timing lines up perfectly, my money is on him being Antonidas for sure.<br />
<br />
I disagree. All my money is on that being Medivh. Also; this image is from Stormwind, not Lordaeron and the movie is about the first war, while the summit happens afterwards! =)</div></div><hr />
