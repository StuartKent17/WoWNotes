Trinkets guide on PvPScene.com<br />
Hey, it's still moving ! There is an obvious lack in news but I heard that quality is better than quantity. This time we've got a user submitted article with a nice Trinket guide (http://www.pvpscene.com/index.php?topic=1142.0)<br />

Blue posts<br />
I guess the 2.3 patch and season 3 deployment killed the enthusiasm of our loved blue posters, however there is something that might make a few hunters happy.<br />
Hunters/Ghost Wolves<br />
Even if players weren't supposed to tame Grimtotem Spirit Guides in the first place, the devs agreed that this is a fun use of an in-game mechanics and they therefore have no plans to &quot;fix&quot; the issue. (Source (http://forums.wow-europe.com/thread.html?topicId=1782078645&amp;postId=18049985401&amp;sid=1#3))<br />
<br />
Heroic Mechanar<br />
The Charged Fist on the Tempest-Forge Destroyers can do a lot of damage, but this is a nice challenge for the group and there are no plans to change them for the moment. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=3168364719&amp;postId=32336825690&amp;sid=1#115))<br />
<br />
Quests<br />
Building money at low level isn't viewed as an issue, don't expect any addition of daily quests or anything helping grinding gold at &quot;low&quot; levels. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=3168405277&amp;postId=32333431881&amp;sid=1#3))<br />

New feature on Wowhead : In game item links<br />
Wowhead (http://www.wowhead.com) is everywhere ! Even in game actually. You can now get a line of code to copy in game by clicking the &quot;Get in-game item link&quot; next to each item on the site. Just paste it in any frame window, and you will be able to link the item to your friends by shift clicking it like any other item links ! <br />
Note: This won't work on items never dropped on your server, you will eventually get disconnected if you keep trying to link an item never &quot;seen&quot; by the server.<br />

<br />
The trinket guide for healing trinkets was quite ridiculous... I don't know about other classes, but for healers it was not even close to helpful/resourceful. In fact if indeed it is ordered from best/worst then it is blatently wrong.</div></div><hr />
