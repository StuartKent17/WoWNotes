WoW Token Coming Soon – Additional Details<br />
The WoW Token (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/122284-wow-token) is going live in the US sometime soon (https://twitter.com/Bashiok/status/580159505553461248) at a $20 price point. <br />
The recently announced WoW Token is currently in testing on the PTR, and is slated for launch some time after the March 24 release of Patch 6.1.2. In the meantime, we wanted to share some additional details about the Token, including regional pricing information and more on our global rollout plans.<br />
<br />
WoW Token Rollout<br />
<br />
We’ll begin rolling out the WoW Token in the weeks following Patch 6.1.2’s release, starting with the Americas game region (including realms serving North America, Oceania, and Latin America) and then expanding to other game regions in the weeks after that. Launching the Token once Patch 6.1.2 has been live for a while will help us ensure the foundation for the feature is solid, and kicking things off with a single region is the best way for us to ensure everything’s going smoothly before launching worldwide. We’ll provide further updates on timing as we get closer to the Token’s launch in each region.<br />
<br />
Region-wide Exchange<br />
<br />
As discussed in our original announcement (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/4749-Introducing-the-WoW-Token), each game region (Americas, Europe, Korea, Taiwan, and China) will have its own shared WoW Token exchange. When the rollout begins in the Americas game region, players in North America, Latin America, and Oceania will all be able to purchase a WoW Token from the in-game Shop. In the Americas game region, the price of a Token will be $20 USD (or roughly equivalent in each local currency). We’ll share additional regional pricing details as we get closer to launch.<br />
<br />
Once purchased, a Token can then be put up for sale in a region-wide exchange via a new Game Time tab in the Auction House. (Note that while you’ll see the new Game Time tab in that auction house with the launch of Patch 6.1.2, it won’t be active until the WoW Token launches in your region.) While the rest of the Auction House will remain realm-based, a region-wide WoW Token exchange will provide the largest possible pool of prospective buyers and ensures everyone has access to a vibrant, active Token marketplace. In the Americas, Europe, Korea, and Taiwan, players who purchase a WoW Token from the Auction House will be able to redeem it for 30 days of game time.<br />
<br />
Going for Gold<br />
<br />
Because the Token exchange has to start somewhere, we will be setting the initial gold value of the WoW Token ourselves. The starting gold value in each region will be based on several factors, including regional in-game economies, but ultimately our goal is to select a fair and reasonable starting price. After that, the Token’s gold value will be determined dynamically based primarily on player supply and demand. Simply put, if more WoW Tokens are being listed than are being purchased, the price will automatically drift downward over time. If people are purchasing Tokens from the Auction House faster than they’re being put up for sale, then prices will go up accordingly. As a reminder, to help make sure players can trade WoW Tokens confidently, once a Token sells, the seller will receive the amount of gold they were quoted at the time they listed their Token.<br />
<br />
We know a lot of you are excited to exchange a WoW Token or two, and we’re looking forward to making the feature available in the near future. We’ll provide additional updates on the rollout of the WoW Token feature soon.<br />
<br />
<br />
Patch 6.1.2 Notes<br />
Introducing the WoW Token<br />
Coming soon to an Azeroth near you: the WoW Token, a new in-game item that allows players to simply and securely exchange gold and game time between each other.<br />
<br />
Players will be able to purchase a WoW Token through the in-game Shop for real money, and then sell it on the Auction House for gold at the current market price. When a player buys a WoW Token from the Auction House for gold, the Token becomes Soulbound, and the player can then redeem it for 30 days of game time.<br />
<br />
<br />
The WoW Token feature will be enabled at a future date. Patch 6.1.2 adds in the framework needed for the WoW Token feature in the game client and is not active at this time. Check out WoW Token Coming Soon – Additional Details for more details on how the feature works.<br />

Response to Player Feedback<br />
I don't know if anyone else feels this way but to me it kinda feels like blizzard doesn't really know what they are doing anymore ...<br />
<br />
They implement something and a minority of people complain about how it works and they change it without taking into consideration the number of subscriptions compared to the number of people complaining its almost as if they're saying&quot;yeah what we did there was bad so lets change it because 2% are unhappy about it&quot; and the majority of us are sitting here like &quot;it wasn't that bad now its horrible&quot; or &quot; yeah it needed changing but not like that&quot; how is this fair to most of us when 2% get what they want and were just suppose to suck it up and accept it because we love playing WoW Blizzard keeps going back on their ideas like they don't have good ideas to start with.<br />
Believe it or not, decisions aren't just made based on posts/player opinion alone. While these can factor into decisions made, we also take a look at player behavior in the game since not everyone takes to the forums or Twitter to express how they are approaching things. Comments here can be helpful for the sake that someone may feel strongly enough about 'x' item/issue, but it doesn't account for everything.<br />
<br />
Design is just as much art as it is science and what people may enjoy/like one day may change the next. Being human animals as we are, we can get complacent or bored with &quot;sameness&quot;. It's not always easily predictable what the outcome of a change may be, though we try to anticipate as much as possible. <br />
<br />
It's not merely a &quot;knowing or not knowing&quot; issue. We have to take into account past experiences as well as sometimes take some (strategic) risks in shaping and molding the game toward its next evolution. With so many many people playing, it's not possible to please everyone at all times, but we do what we can to entertain people as much as we can with the game. We want people to have fun (despite claims to the contrary.) It's just discerning what that means and it will never mean the same thing to everyone. <br />
<br />
We have tons of ideas. It's never an issue of having them. It's usually an issue of picking and choosing which ones will work best. Sometimes we miss the mark – we're human after all – but we do our best to make sure those times are the exceptions rather than the rule.<br />
<br />
Ghostcrawler may have known what he was doing. This new batch of dev's do not.<br />
There is always this strange idea that there are a &quot;new batch of devs&quot; when that's just not true. We're very fortunate to have many veteran developers who have been with us for years as well as newer developers (new to Blizzard at least) who bring new ideas to the table. All in all though, it's a collaborative process not even just among the World of Warcraft team, but across the company with so many of us also being players.<br />
<br />
I know people bring up Ghostcrawler on a regular basis and I and many others here are still friends with him and keep in touch. He was a great part of the team while he was here, but he wasn't solely responsible for development. Like any job, people sometimes move on. That's all there is ever really to say about it. <br />
<br />
I know there are people that are going to have feedback about specific items they care about in regard to ongoing development, and muddling those thoughts into this thread isn't the best way to convey them. It's too easy for your thoughts to get lost in everyone else's. If there's an item you wish to share constructive feedback on (with specifics), we can always read and carry them on for you. <br />
<br />
As was quoted, we listen and it still stands, we're going to do our best to make the best choices we can for the future of the game as a whole.<br />
<br />
Offhandedly dismissing concerns about what players consider 'fun' is standard Blizzard protocol, but doesn't make for good community relations.<br />
At no point have I &quot;offhandedly&quot; or otherwise dismissed concerns. My job (every week) is to convey concerns and constructive feedback that are being bubbled up by the community. <br />
<br />
The thing is, even if people have other reasons for logging in (seeing friends etc), that means there is something tacitly fun about that interaction that draws them back. At no point did I say those people are finding all aspects of the game fun, but there must be some aspect of it (even if it's social interaction or &quot;collecting&quot;) that they are enjoying and finding compelling.<br />
<br />
Again, we read the posts, but posts only reflect one part of the overall interactions people are having with the game. Sometimes those agree and sometimes they don't. We take all things into account and make changes when they seem to be the most appropriate. There is no &quot;all or nothing&quot;, that's why there are so many different aspects to the game. Different people enjoy different content types. Some dabble in everything, some only have one aspect they focus on. That doesn't negate the value of the game and it's offerings as a whole.<br />
<br />
How much weight is given to in-game behavior? I ask this solely from the perspective that if there is no other choice, or the other choices are worse than the one being acted upon, that particular behavior is valueless when deciding which way a particular decision should go. <br />
You're correct that in-game behavior can only show one part of the whole. The next part is, &quot;why&quot;. Again, it can be pretty evident by various factors including what people say along with what they do. In-game behavior can have a lot of weight, but that's not a simple, &quot;they're all doing it so it must be OK.&quot; Sometimes what is occurring isn't what the outcome was intended to be, thus we make changes and adjust. <br />
<br />
Very few things are cut and dry unless it's an outright exploit or abuse of the game mechanics. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/365610-does-blizzard-know-what-they-are-doing/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/16717542094?page=13#259))<br />

Why would you pay $20 for a monthly sub fee when you can pay just a month of subbing for $15?<br />

IS it because they think it will hit the gold sellers harder?<br />

Is it simply because they want those that buy it to pay more for a month if all there going to do it sell it for gold?</div></div><hr />

<br />
You wouldn't. If you want the game time, you pay gold to buy one from someone else who paid $20. If you want gold, you pay the $20 so you can sell the token for someone else to buy and use.</div></div><hr />

Nobody is going to be paying $20 for a monthly sub fee.<br />

Read the FAQ they posted weeks ago.<br />
<br />
http://us.battle.net/wow/en/blog/18141101/introducing-the-wow-token-3-2-2015<br />
<br />
Q: Is there a deposit? Does the Auction House take a cut of the Token seller’s gold?<br />
A: There’s no deposit, and the Auction House does not take a cut of the gold for WoW Token sales. The standard deposit is designed to dissuade players from spamming the auction house with items that aren’t selling, and the standard cut is designed to dissuade players from buying and reselling items for minuscule markups. These issues don’t apply to the WoW Token, so there’s no need for a deposit or cut.</div></div><hr />

You have the option of paying for gold obtained by other players, in a non-EULA breaking manner. What's the problem with that?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why would you pay $20 for a monthly sub fee when you can pay just a month of subbing for $15?<br />
<br />
IS it because they think it will hit the gold sellers harder?<br />
<br />
Is it simply because they want those that buy it to pay more for a month if all there going to do it sell it for gold?<br />
<br />
its easy. its another cashcow system for blizz. each token someone buys gets them 20 bucks. the one who use the token, spend them not 15 dollars for the sub. they earned 5 dollars. as there are plenty of people, that want to change some rl money for ingame gold in a secure way, blizz will make 5 dollars with each of them. if there are 1 million transactions in a half year, blizz get 5 millions for doing nothing. thats the only real reason why the token exists. blizz want the money that otherwise is going to china.</div></div><hr />

Don't think I mentioned any shady websites or giving away CC I'm talking about game time.<br />
<br />
There's bunch of people on each server and/or friendly guildies from which you can get game time for gold, they will have cheaper price because they do not give $20 for it but $14.99, also have yet to hear of anyone getting in trouble over this.</div></div><hr />

You mean if they ever catch you. I know people who have been buying gold for years and nothing has ever been done to them. IF the gold cost isn't somewhere near $15 a month in the current market, why the hell would they stop from going to a third party and skipping blizzard all together? <br />

man, you are doing a lot of extra work for a couple dollars. Getting and loading a throw-away CC? This is fast, easy and direct with no complications. I guess if you are poor you can nickle-and-dime and get a better value.. but for most people it is just really easy to do it through Blizzard.<br />
<br />
People value their time and value a stable system. By your lines of thinking, why aren´t you playing free2play games, why are you paying Blizzard a premium to use their game when a ton of AAA games are now free? Not everyone needs to nickle-and-dime every dollar they spend, and most people will pay a premium just to have it done quickly and legaly.<br />
<br />
Also, it is right in front of your face, no need to go get a throw-away CC.. that is just silly.. if that takes you 15 minutes to do, just with minimum wage you have already cost youself $3 or $4.</div></div><hr />

<br />
True, but at the same time it is infact pay to win, as you pay dollars to Blizzard to get gold and that gold then can buy you best items in the game=pay to win. Whether you buy the items directly or indirectly from Blizzard is semantics, as the end result is the same; you can get the best item through a shortcut by spending real currency, instead of playing the game properly.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is a key issue, people have been buying gold with impunity for years and years, I can't remember the last time I heard of someone being banned for it. Selling it, yes. Buying it, no. <br />
<br />
IF Blizzard cracks down and starts banning gold buyers...we'll see. If they don't, they won't sell very many, because the gold sellers are going to aim for that spot where a month of game time is cheaper through them, than through Blizzard.</div></div><hr />

Argument? Not only that you need medication but you lack adequate IQ to be able to make conversation witj.... Kid and his millions of gold, I have about 2million, spent millions on game-time over the years ( havent bought it with cash for 5 years + ), few million on mounts and gave away about 2million to friends and guild members...<br />

If the tokens trade at 20k gold then it will be a very attractive offer that will take custom away from gold sellers and keep it in the game, and best of all it makes gold buying totally legit, in game and absolutely within the EULA. Superb move, Blizzard.<br />
<br />
The token exchange is not an original by Blizzard, I'm not giving them that credit. But what this does, and it's the long term genious that you have to admire, is that this move sets up the downfall of professional Gold farmers / sellers. Which has a knock on effect to the custom (and turnover) of professional run botting companies (OK, we all know there's pretty much the one). This is a good thing for the WoW community.<br />
<br />
As for the detractors, the people complaning of &quot;Blizzard selling gold&quot; or &quot;the price is too high&quot;. Well, what would you prefer? You buy gold from a third party website with artificial inflation, gold farmed via illegitimate practices or taken from stolen accounts? The price is too high? Then you can't afford it, end of; it's not for you.<br />
<br />
A slight problem I forsee, is that professional criminals come along with their stolen credit card networks and buy up Tokens, sell for Gold en masse and this is their new revenue of 'gold farming'. If that sounds far fetched then you don't know about a recent exploit that saw the generation of thousands of accounts (thousands, accounts) with stolen/fake CCs. As long as Blizzard have some kind of protection for buyers (giving gold) for Tokens purchased on illegitimate cards and protection for sellers receiving illegitimately generated Gold for their Tokens then all is well. Otherwise it could be a big can of worms.<br />
<br />
With the security and protection (for buyer/seller) in place however, it is an absolute win/win for Blizzard and their customers.</div></div><hr />

It is within EULA since they want it to be and it suits them. Before that ( we have option to buy game-time as a gift for years now ) it wasnt. Mechanics were there they just didnt want to allow it. Now they do and charge it 20$... Idiotic move....<br />

It wont and it will never do such a thing. Gold sellers have options and ways to farm millions of gold, normal players doesnt so gold seller will be cheaper and he can sell you game-time as a gift.

<br />
This is true. Buying the &quot;best&quot; gear off of the AH doesn't kill Blackhand for you. It just gives you a couple of pieces of really good gear that may or may not be itemized well for your spec. It's not &quot;Pay-to-Win&quot;. Most people that raid aren't going to buy more than one or two items from the auction house, if that. Not a full set of gear.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am trying to figure out one thing, say 10000 people buy a token to put up for sale, before people get gold they need to be &quot;upon a successful sale&quot;, so you need 10000 people to purchase tokens, but you could be number 300 and number 8888 in que of where your token is to be sold, is this correct?<br />
<br />
If so, I wonder if Blizzard will ever resort to fake accounts purchasing tokens so that more people will continuously purchase tokens with real gold. As I have a feeling it could take months and months before say even 4000 token are purchased by real people. Then again Blizz won't care how long it takes to sell all these tokens as they already received their money.<br />

I am not saying they are going to do it, but I know lots of silly sites use fake accounts where they usually win the &quot;monthly&quot; prizes etc have some fake person saying omg I won the reward etc etc.</div></div><hr />

You're paying for gold from other players, so there's no inflation. If anything it should spread gold out more evenly. Selling gold is nothing new, there's always that one dude in guild who's fucking amazing at it, you buy him a month of wow time, he gives you 30k</div></div><hr />

If someone wins over you because he has 2-3 items of a slightly higher item level... I would reevaluate my skill levels if I were you.<br />
<br />
What does it being limited to 3 items have to do with anything? It's fucking gear you're buying with real life money. They might as well just put the fucking gear on the in game shop to save time. It's the exact same thing. <br />
<br />
Luck? How is &quot;the person with the most money wins the auction&quot; luck?<br />
<br />
You do realize a bunch of boes are bis right? Of course not cause you have no fucking clue what you're even talking about. Even ONE piece of gear is considered pay to win. It's buying an in game advantage with real money. That's the definition, and it meets it. Unless you're trying to say gear gives no advantage, if you think that you're retarded. <br />
<br />
It's pay to win, get over it. Blizzard is selling bis gear right in the store and fanboys are defending it. I remember when it was mounts the fanboys said &quot;It's just cosmetic, I don't care. If they start selling bis gear I'm out&quot; yet here we are, watching you guys defend some more. Pathetic.</div></div><hr />

They did already say they were going to look at the BoEs and BMAH in the future, with respect to Tokens.

<br />
The bmah was selling mythic gear for a raid that WASN'T EVEN OUT YET. A lot of the crafted gear was bis for some classes. I still have the dmf trinket upgraded to 4/4, have a look at the burning candle. A lot of the mythic boe bracers are bis for a lot of classes.

<br />
Despite this not being true in terms of gear available, gold is also use to buy runs to get access to the higher end, BiS gear - has been since vanilla, and has never slacked off. You can buy literally anything in the game- titles, mounts, pvp ranking, achievements - for the right amount of gold, or in some cases, hard cash through paypal. <br />
<br />
This is also going fuxor up the economies on most servers for a while, this will be a sudden influx of gold, and prices will rise on a lot of items. If I'm an AH Master, with all this new gold floating around, what do you think I'm going to do - lower the price on my spectral tiger - or raise it to siphon off more of this new freely available gold? <br />
<br />
We've watched this happen in real life, the last decade, as the Fed pumped more money into the economy, and eroded the value of the dollar. <br />
<br />
This is not a trivial thing to do. This is a major turning point for the game, I don't know what will happen exactly, but I'm predicting a bumpy ride in the WoW economy for a while. Will it ever stabilize? Probably - but it will be a much different market by then. This is going to have a profound effect on the game, just watch.<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
you do know you get instant pay the market value when you put it up right?<br />
<br />
No, you don't. Go on the PTR and try the process, you can &quot;buy&quot; a token from the store, you get a token. You auction it, and the screen tells you the current price, and a &quot;sell&quot; button, and an estimate of how long it should take to sell. It said 30 minutes for my test token, but it sold in 2 minutes. (200g on the PTR). <br />
<br />
You don't get the money right away, you get it on the sale of the token, and they're giving you an estimate of how long. Now, if Blizzard is going to tweak things in the game behind the scenes so people don't wait more than say 12 hours, I wouldn't be surprised - there's no indication of how many tokens are available, just the price, and a &quot;buy&quot; button. <br />
<br />
I also wouldn't be surprised if there's a hard limit for available tokens, and they'll just automatically send the gold via the system - there's no name on your receipt in the mailbox when you sell one, you have no way of knowing who bought it - or if Blizzard's system gave you the gold and erased the token, because of a backlog of tokens.<br />
<br />
They've thought this through. They can control the supply and price at any point in either transaction, with no data available to the player.</div></div><hr />

As WoW always was. This only gives people who want to buy gold the chance to do so while taking gold out of the economy. With something of such a high value, gold might actually get some value back.<br />
<br />
push the button in your brain..<br />
<br />
you buy the tokens for real money and sell this on the ah..<br />
<br />
you earn ingame money (gold)..<br />
<br />
you buy from this gold all the updated items with high item level..<br />
<br />
THIS IS PAY TO WIN!<br />
<br />
gratz blizzard! another dark moment in this expansion..<br />
<br />
Do you always have to type like you're writing some obnoxious poem or are some tinfoil conspsiricy nut on those stupid new age sites? Pay to win what exactly, crafted items? oooh, the winning! Dem five mans are not prepared. <br />
<br />
If you think people will &quot;win&quot; against you because they've got three crafted items and an item from the BMAH, I'd reevalute how you play. If you don't like the game, vote with your wallet or voice your concerns on the official forums, rather than again, stalking a news site for it like an obsessed ex boyfriend.<br />
<br />
<br />
WRONG.<br />
<br />
The bmah was selling mythic gear for a raid that WASN'T EVEN OUT YET. A lot of the crafted gear was bis for some classes. I still have the dmf trinket upgraded to 4/4, have a look at the burning candle. A lot of the mythic boe bracers are bis for a lot of classes. If you don't know what you're talking about don't bother posting and embarrassing yourself.<br />
<br />
And as you can see that was a lie. Since they are going through with this and the boes and bmah still exist. If they remove them before tokens go live I'll apologize, but we both know I won't be eating crow here. As of right now it's pay to win. I'm not holding my breath that the next tier will change any of it.<br />
<br />
Having a trinket or a pair of mythic bracers isn't going to make you &quot;win&quot; anything if the rest of your gear is shite and you're crap. And adding tokens doesn't mean they're not going to be removing boe from the BMAH, the two things aren't mutually inclusive. Even boosts are going to be waiting for next teir, in which case you're /definitely/ not winning anything aside from a mount because the gear will be obsolete. I don't know about your server, but I certainly don't see people advertising mythic boosts.</div></div><hr />

It's been that way for a while bruh. I don't know whats so new or shocking about it. People have millions of gold and you have an issue with people spending 20 dollars to get 20k gold or some unknown amount? That's a far cry.</div></div><hr />

It's fucking gear you're buying with real life money. They might as well just put the fucking gear on the in game shop to save time. It's the exact same thing. <br />
<br />
Luck? How is &quot;the person with the most money wins the auction&quot; luck?<br />
<br />
You do realize a bunch of boes are bis right? Of course not cause you have no fucking clue what you're even talking about. Even ONE piece of gear is considered pay to win. It's buying an in game advantage with real money. That's the definition, and it meets it. Unless you're trying to say gear gives no advantage, if you think that you're retarded. <br />
<br />
It's pay to win, get over it. Blizzard is selling bis gear right in the store and fanboys are defending it. I remember when it was mounts the fanboys said &quot;It's just cosmetic, I don't care. If they start selling bis gear I'm out&quot; yet here we are, watching you guys defend some more. Pathetic.<br />
<br />
And here I was under the impression that the thing you're buying is an item of fluctuating value,that someone will have to purchase. No gold generated, but yeah. Totally comparable to BiS items being directly sold (and generated) in the shop.<br />
<br />
I wonder if there's people sitting with like 50 guardian cubs they can't get rid off.</div></div><hr />

Exactly - BLizzard is adding more and more things into the game that requires gold rather than actual gameplay. You might not be able to get the very best... (btw - you can get some mythic gear tho) but gold will be used to skip the boring stuff...<br />
<br />
Oh wait... thats what F2P games do...<br />
<br />
So why is BLizzard charging players 15$ for subs then?..</div></div><hr />

Extra gold isn't much of an advantage..........You dont win arena matches with gold, you don't kill raid bosses with gold.............I don't understand how you can consider this pay to win.</div></div><hr />

Here is an interesting fact. Few years back we were talking about how mounts were ok to pay real life money for in WOW. Now... we are talking about if it's ok to buy Mythic level gear for real money. And fact is that ppl CAN buy some Mythic gear for real life money now. <br />
<br />
See where we are heading? <br />
<br />
Some ppl realised that few years back when it started... but this is not where the monetisation will end in WOW. You can be sure of that. <br />
<br />
The only thing we can do is to walk away.. or get dragged in even further. <br />
<br />
I'm leaving and never looking back. I'm going to play good games that are not both sub and pay to win.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You are making it sound like anyone is going to be able to buy a full set of gear within hours of selling tokens.<br />
<br />
First off, the only people that this really affects are people going for the world firsts...which is like &lt; 0.01% of the population. Past that, what do you care how other people get their gear? What does it matter if someone spends an insane amount of money to get gear and clear a raid...how exactly does that affect how much fun YOU have playing the game? (Not to mention, this already happens now, albeit illegally).<br />
<br />
So, lets just say the new token sells for 20k, which seems like a high estimate. Those BMAH Mythics, when they are at their most useful, sell for well over 100k, (I'll just use 100k for easy math). In this case it would cost someone ~$100 to get a single piece of gear, estimating VERY conservatively. Not that it wouldn't happen, but it seems rather unlikely people are going to start shelling out almost $2000 for a set of gear that is only useful for one tier. Not to mention, the BMAH itself basically limits this abuse anyway, since there is only usually what...one piece of mythic gear on there at a time? <br />
<br />
Each tier of raid generally has 1-3 pieces of BoE gear that drop in raid that any one class can use and, as far as the crafted items go, most people who are THIS concerned about getting an 'edge' are more than likely going to have these already, due to numerous alts and guildmates.<br />
<br />
Even still, even if they buy their 3 crafted items this way, that only gives them 7 pieces of gear...with the possibility of 1 more each week (from the BMAH, WITH luck)...and that's only ONE person! It's not like there's an unlimited supply of Mythic BoE gear on the AH, especially not in the first few weeks when it would actually be the most advantageous.<br />
<br />
Now, since you are saying that buying even ONE piece of gear is pay-to-win, I ask you: Unless you are going for World First kills, who cares? What exactly is 'winning' in this game? What can another person do, if they buy gear, that could somehow prevent you from having fun? If you join a pug, clear a raid, get a couple pieces of gear, have a good time, and then later on you find out that a person in your raid was wearing a piece of gear that he bought, does this somehow retroactively take away the fun you had? Is it because they didn't have to 'work' as hard for their gear and just knowing this fact makes you angry? If a single piece of gear costs anywhere near $100, I can almost guarantee they worked harder for that piece of gear than you did.<br />
<br />
If there were things in game that could only be gotten by the first people that get there (other than world firsts, which I don't really count) which then prevented other people from getting them then sure, this would be unfair. But the fact that people 'buying' gear doesn't stop 99.99999% of the players from achieving what they would normally achieve anyway, it should in no way have a direct affect on another person.<br />
<br />
Setting all this aside, if it really is THAT big of a deal, it could be easily fixed by limiting people to only being able to sell one coin each month, preventing them from being able to even buy a single piece of gear.</div></div><hr />

While these can factor into decisions made, we also take a look at player behavior in the game since not everyone takes to the forums or Twitter to express how they are approaching things. Comments here can be helpful for the sake that someone may feel strongly enough about 'x' item/issue, but it doesn't account for everything.<br />
<br />
Design is just as much art as it is science and what people may enjoy/like one day may change the next. Being human animals as we are, we can get complacent or bored with &quot;sameness&quot;. It's not always easily predictable what the outcome of a change may be, though we try to anticipate as much as possible.<br />
<br />
It's not merely a &quot;knowing or not knowing&quot; issue. We have to take into account past experiences as well as sometimes take some (strategic) risks in shaping and molding the game toward its next evolution. With so many many people playing, it's not possible to please everyone at all times, but we do what we can to entertain people as much as we can with the game. We want people to have fun (despite claims to the contrary.) It's just discerning what that means and it will never mean the same thing to everyone.<br />
<br />
We have tons of ideas. It's never an issue of having them. It's usually an issue of picking and choosing which ones will work best. Sometimes we miss the mark – we're human after all – but we do our best to make sure those times are the exceptions rather than the rule.<br />
.<br />
<br />
<br />
This just shows the developers of Blizzard just don't fucking listen to playtesters in their beta and alpha builds anymore or even remotely try to make the game fun. &quot;oh the game isn't fun&quot;, well we just human. No shit sherlock!! excusable if you didn't playtest but what about the full year of fucking playtesting you shits done in the 13 months before release?<br />
<br />
Case in point - give a sample of playtesters of 10 characters each and their job was to do garrison daily chores every day and tell them when it stops being fun (this is how you playtest give an edge case scenario), they would of found it unfun in under a month of course doing this would of took zero effort and 100% of thinking which the developers DO NOT have, so full of fucking ideas, zero fucking clue how to implement them.</div></div><hr />

I believe there will be lots buying the token to sell. I am just curious if my token is in a que of say 5000 of 7000 tokens, how long will it take for my token to be bought. It could be year, we have no clue, but Blizz will already have made their money from it, it won't matter to them if it sits for 10 months etc. I am not sure if there will be a charge back waiting game that you can't list your token on the AH from at least 30 days from the day you purchased just to make sure you don't do a charge back etc.<br />
<br />
from what i understand blizzard will only set batch of intiial tokens and then let market decide prices meaning - if you want to sell you token fast put lowest price on AH - supply &amp; demand will decide with time - too many tokens in ah means low prices cause you will be undercutting each other only to sell token :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
You realize there is no undercutting possible with the tokens, right? You can decide when to sell, but not for how much. You only get the amount shown at the time you list your token. When you decide to list your token, it will go into a FIFO queue and you will get your gold once your token reaches the front of the line and sells.<br />
<br />
Supply and demand will set the prices due to the ratio of new tokens listed versus tokens being bought, but it won't be subject to undercutting.</div></div><hr />

I don't think it'll be bad. I sold a couple credd in Wildstar and they sold within 12 hours, usually within an hour. Seemed to depend what time I listed them. Same thing with REX in Rift. List in prime time it goes quick. List in off peak and it might take a day. WoW will likely have similar results, possibly better.</div></div><hr />
