Recruit a Friend Active Until Level 85<br />
It looks like the RAF update (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/275115-recruit-a-friend-updates-coming-soon/) will be increasing the maximum level that it provides extra experience and levels from 80 to 85! Keep in mind this works for currently active RAF accounts, but no return date for the program has been announced yet.<br />

http://blue.mmo-champion.com/public/style_images/master/tracker/flags/us-en.png Connected Realms Update<br />
As previously announced, we’ve been working toward connecting realms to increase the number of players on low-population realms, and since then have completed several connections.

Ability Balance in PvP and PvE<br />
PvP is an intrinsic part of World of Warcraft. Just the fact that players have to choose one of two factions that are at war with one another is proof enough of that.<br />
<br />
Nevertheless, if you follow WoW since the very beginning, you can see the evolution that PvP went through until now.<br />
Initially, there wasn’t even any instanced PvP content at all. Battlegrounds were introduced a few months after the game was launched and Arenas only came with the first expansion.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile you had a lot of PvE content being pushed out, new raids, new dungeons, new items, new quests… but this is beside the point, it’s not fair to compare the amount of PvE to PvP content, they’re two completely different beasts.<br />
<br />
PvE players will never be happy if we let content stagnate, that’s just the nature of PvE Content. It needs constant and regular updates. Players also expect to progress, and it’s even more complex than that, because they also expect content to remain challenging. (Players’ experience rises, and the new content’s difficulty has to match it)<br />
<br />
PvP players on the other hand are much more likely to be happy with less content updates and less changes, as they tend to focus on balance and gameplay mechanics.<br />
<br />
With this in mind and given that there are many more players interested on the PvE than the on the PvP side of WoW, I think it comes as no surprise that PvE uses a lot more resources than PvP does.<br />
<br />
Things can get even more complicated when you start to look at what drives players and what their motivations are, for example, item upgrades and character power progression are concepts that pose a challenge to PvP balance, but whether you like it or not, it became one of the main drives for a lot of PvP players, so PvE and PvP are actually tangled with each other on many aspects.<br />
<br />
You can try to make a distinction and say that those are actually “PvE players” that enjoy PvP as a way to progress their characters, but does that really matter? Maybe it does, but the fact is, there are more players interested into PvP than the “hardcore” PvP crowd.<br />
WoW is a game where PvE and PvP are supposed to be mixed, the open world is the best example of that, it’s neither exclusively PvE nor PvP, it’s both at the same time. That was the essence of PvP in WoW, to let players fight each other whenever they go face to face in the open world, and ideally that should feel seamless. I know it’s not really seamless at the moment (especially with the controversy about world-PvP), but maybe we can do something about that in the future.<br />
<br />
The topic being discussed is a very hard problem to solve and I really appreciate your thoughts on it, I know how frustrating it can be when certain things occasionally affect PvP. I’ve always been into both arenas and raiding, and I try my best to have an unbiased view on the subject, I think a lot of you do too, and we just have to realize that there is no easy and perfect solution for this, what you can expect though is that we will do our very best (and your feedback really helps) to make both PvE and PvP coexist &quot;peacefully&quot; at the same time in the same game. <br />

Character / Items<br />
I'm not sure about that. It's hard to see the effect of a single piece of gear on performance. Upgrade is upgrade.<br />
Weapons and trinkets are easily felt IMO. Chests and helms less so. Bracers are hard to feel even though I know they contribute. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/386571758704148480))<br />
My psych classes told me a diverse reward structure is what you should go for,if you want a game to be engaging<br />
We have not been super successful there. WoW has lots of reward types but many players care far more for power than anything else. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/386970595184746496))<br />

How do you feel warforged worked out this tier combined with upgrades? made the 25 man race to easy and the 10man to hard.<br />
Weapon or trinket drops probably had a much larger effect than the warforged ilevels. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/387965683016794112))<br />
<br />
Is there a specific reason why Bindings of Immerseus is giving Spirit instead of Hit and giving Non-Mages/Locks an advantage?<br />
The Spirit was aimed at healers. There wasn't an elegant way to make it &quot;non-hit Spirit.&quot; (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/391325686691926016))<br />

Sorry, full regem-reenchant-reforge every upgrade is so tedious and expensive that I don't bother anymore. And I feel bad.<br />
We agree that we have let post loot modification get a bit out of control. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/390930522559373312))<br />

I realize you probably won't respond to this but any news on this mount (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTDWi8G3pj0&amp;feature=player_embedded)? I'm dying for it.<br />

OpenRaid Updated<br />
Our friends over at OpenRaid have released some nice updates (http://openraid.org/main/news/90) to their site today:<br />
<br />
<br />
QuickRaid Revamp - Now you can create groups for things like Flex raids that are going on now rather than scheduling something in the future or relying on a crowded chat to find people. You can also quickly check experience and gear based on data from the armory without individually looking everyone up.<br />
Repeatable Events - If you have a weekly run, such as ICC, Ulduar, or Elegon, you can now quickly copy this week's event and invite everyone that came, making for easier weekly runs.<br />
Dual-Spec Roster Sign-Ups - You can now sign up for events as multiple specs<br />
OpenRaid Addon (http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/openraid) - The addon has been updated to make it a quick copy and paste to invite your group, with more updates coming.<br />
<br />

It does when you're on a low population server where meta gems cost 1k+ and normal gems 300-500G, if you get upgrades on a constant basis it stacks up fast (or if you're an altoholic).</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. Transfer, I did.<br />
2. If you're too cheap to transfer take the time to level alts as profession mules. Everyone I know has alts with all professions maxed.<br />
3. Farm. It's insanely easy to make money in this game to afford whatever ridiculous prices the AH is putting up.<br />
4. Join a guild where you can make friends and they'll help you out with gems and enchants.<br />
<br />
Or you can go with the 5th option which I posted a picture of earlier.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For me, it is not only that, it is also remember to do it after a raid if what you need isn´t on the AH. One time I stuck a green gem in a slot just because the blue version wasn´t available. A month later, I finally noticed I still had the green gem. Other times I just log off after a raid and forget completely the next time I log in. I don´t think we need to remove reforging or gems however, since they allow some customization. Enchanting would be the one I would look at since most of the time there is no choice or gameplay involved with it.<br />

I will be so happy when OpenRaid finally kills off oqueue. oQueue is so useful and a needed part of the game now.. but wow, what a piece of crap it is. Hopefully soon there will be another alternative for heroic scenarios and RBGs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It actually seems like the reverse will happen, though. OpenRaid has been around for so long (I was using it back in Cata), and has always been for scheduled raids. That's its strong point. The chatroom capability had the added benefit of ad-hoc groups, but few really tended to use it in that method.<br />
<br />
oQueue on the other hand, is best for ad-hoc groups and raids. I could create a post, and within minutes form a group... whereas advertising in the OpenRaid chatroom for same group I'd wait for a very long time, and creating a post on the OpenRaid scheduler would limit me to the next 15 minute window (and if I didn't have a group by that time, I'd have to reschedule all over... or make the post for longer out and deal with over-booking.) Now if OpenRaid somehow absorbed that ad-hoc in-game scheduling function, then I could see them taking over.<br />
<br />
Or if Blizz took the Looking For Group channel, re-enabled it for Global use across the entire server (like it used to be up until partway through BC), then also enabled it somehow for Global use across the entire region. But without the chat spam that would then result. In other words, implementing something looking very much like OQ inside the game core itself.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I actually agree completely. Especially with the mage class which has a completely different stat priority for each spec (fire wants crit, arcane wants mastery, frost wants haste). So if you want to change specs you have to replace pretty much every gem, enchant, and reforge you have, but this means replacing one piece of gear could completely wreck havoc on your stats such as hit cap and could cause you to need to replace 3-8 gems or more as well as enchants and reforges.<br />
<br />
Also why does Aggramar get paired with a realm that has an even lower population V_V our realm is dead.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Boohoo. You should feel bad that you're too cheap and lazy to spend 10 or 15 minutes and a couple hundred gold optimizing your gear.<br />
<br />
Also if you're completely regemming/reforging after an upgrade you more than likely were doing it wrong to begin with.</div></div><hr />

Or you can go with the option of giving feedback on something you find not fun? He's right that customization options that were added in for the sake of being fun and giving options have just become extremely tedious over time, mostly because changing one piece of gear affects your rating caps and could mean having to re-gem / reforge literally every single piece of equipment just for a bracer upgrade. Only to do it again next week when you get a new belt.</div></div><hr />

snip<br />
<br />
this is why this site needs like buttons. If you really cared about that you wouldn't bother upgrading/enchanting/gemming/reforging anything that isnt absolute best in slot. And if youre guild requires you to do that to keep your raid spot and you dont like it, youre probably holding them back in other ways.</div></div><hr />

Yeah I agree we should obviously do away with gems and reforging because it's too time consuming to run yourself through a website optimizer and click three buttons on an addon.</div></div><hr />

Like if I'm making cookies, and I put salt in instead of sugar. I know how to fix that next time (pay more attention, label them properly), but that doesn't mean it's easy to replace all the salt in the cookies I already made with sugar.</div></div><hr />

<br />
More telling, reforging, regemming, and upgrading is so unfun that people made an addon so you only had to click three buttons and have it done for you, and people use it. They would vastly prefer hitting three buttons to actually having to go through all of it.</div></div><hr />

Look at classes like shamans, if you're ele and have an enh offspec you need to get a whole set of gear! And you're complaining about having to switch some gems around to use your offspec? Honestly this is just getting sad now. This entitled attitude is becoming sickening, people complaining about bosses not falling over for hitting them once, crying for nerfs,about having too many buttons to push, about having to optimize gear, about all the loot you need not dropping the first fucking week. This is an mmo, it's a time sink. They're literally built upon grinding. It seems a ton of people won't be satisfied till you walk into a raid press one of the two buttons you only have available and the boss drops dead and gives you full BIS that's already gemmed chanted and forged. Then what? Then what are you going to do? You'll come on here asking for that second button to be removed. If you want instant gratification quit this game and go masturbate.</div></div><hr />

2. If you're too cheap to transfer take the time to level alts as profession mules. Everyone I know has alts with all professions maxed.<br />
3. Farm. It's insanely easy to make money in this game to afford whatever ridiculous prices the AH is putting up.<br />
4. Join a guild where you can make friends and they'll help you out with gems and enchants.<br />

Or you can go with the 5th option which I posted a picture of earlier.<br />

Totally happy about this. Looks like I'll be going back to the site. I couldn't get rep off the chat and that was driving me up the wall.<br />
<br />
Hopefully Blizzard goes back to it's roots for PvP.<br />
I wasn't around for Vanilla but it just seems like the moment they introduced arenas PvP went to absolute crap. Maybe they'll focus on ladders less (not remove it entirely - just less) and return to what MMORPG PvP is/was supposed to be.<br />
(Large world PvP, grind based rewards that become a hell of a lot easier for skilled players, battlegrounds and faction importance. Ladders just promote people to exploit class imbalances and game mechanics (or worse) so they can get that 1% reward easy or at all.)<br />
<br />
Excited to see what comes out of this.</div></div><hr />

As someone already told you, think about Warriors, Paladins, Druids, etc., not only do they have to change reforges and gems, but also complete sets of gear which needs to drop first. Playing a Fury warrior who off-tanks at least once or twice a week, I can tell you if I could get only the expenses of a mage, I would would be in heaven. <br />
<br />
That said, it doesn't bother me, it's pretty cheap regardless, if you have to spend 2k on gems &amp; reforges you make that 2k back in 2 days.</div></div><hr />

Now if OpenRaid somehow absorbed that ad-hoc in-game scheduling function...<br />
The QuickRaid function (which has been around since the start) was revamped and relaunched to help with this issue. We're hoping that the changes will ease the formation of PUGs in chat. When you have tested the feature and have any suggestions or problems, Let us know! http://openraid.org/queue#queue_feedback_</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Toiran</div><div class="date">2013-11-04, 06:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So It looks like we will see reforging reworked next xpac, I don't really mind it, transmog costs me more, and I have plenty of gold for it but I know a lot of players poor as shit. - As a warrior building a tanking set, it cost me around the price of 6 full reforges for one tank weapon enchant, if you changed that to dancing steel, it's about the price of 20 full reforges.<br />
<br />
Personally, they should just remove hit and expertise caps, or rework them into something else or one stat or something, because that's pretty much the only thing upgrades can screw up otherwise its plain sailing and you just reforge to best secondary stat you can.<br />
<br />
They have a good point about PvP, some games will have like two battlegrounds or similar, and thats it, for ever, and it will be a pure pvp game, because the fun is in strat, balance and so on, not having a shiny new area to do the exact same in, we only have a few basic battlegrounds that copy each others concept like capture the flag and first to resources and then a mix of capture the flag and resources etc. I can't say much on the topic as I don't really pvp much, I should get into it...I used to love the 19 twink bracket years ago though, that was fun when you had full twinks vs twinks, felt sorry for the guys in levelling gear coming into a twink battle, they stood no chance.<br />
<br />
Subject of xpac, I think we actually might be surprised this year, WoD is nowhere near a confirmation, so I still think it's pretty much open still.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Evolution is certainly not the word I would use to describe PvP, like at all. Devolution would probably be more correct. And just stop being shit devs and seperate mechanics for PvE and PvP already.</div></div><hr />

true, and the speed for the European realms is dreadful. At least there are more frequent updates for the US realms. Or so it feels like.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Luckily, it's been Blizzard's philosophy for some time, that when people go to extreme lengths to automatize a process, like addons or macros, then it's probably no good design and should be looked at.</div></div><hr />
