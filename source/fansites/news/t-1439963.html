Armory Stats - Battleground Popularity<br />
Today we are taking a look at the number of battles for each battleground that took place in the last month. To find these numbers, we compared the number of battles a character had in a December snapshot of data to the number of battles they had in a January snapshot of data. <br />
<br />
These numbers come from a character's statistics pane, so any bugs with character statistics will have skewed the results. This means that there isn't any way for us to verify how accurate these numbers are, so do not take them as fact. <br />
<br />
The data used today is a sample made up of ~6.9 million level 90 characters. The sample is slightly biased, as players who are not in a guild are less likely to appear in our sample. <br />

http://blue.mmo-champion.com/public/style_images/master/tracker/flags/gb-en.png Connected Realms Update - 15/01<br />
The following connection will need a little more time, and has been re-scheduled:<br />
<br />
English Realms<br />
<br />
(PvP) Bloodfeather and Kor’gall/Burning Steppes/Executus<br />
<br />
<br />
The following realms are scheduled to be connected next:<br />
<br />
English Realms<br />
<br />
(PvP) Balnazzar and Shattered Halls/Ahn'Qiraj/Trollbane/Talnivarr/Chromaggus/Boulderfist/Daggerspine<br />
(RP PvP) Ravenholdt and Scarshield Legion/The Venture Co/Sporeggar<br />
<br />
<br />
German Realms<br />
<br />
(PvE) Shattrath and Garrosh/Nozdormu<br />
<br />
<br />
I've updated the original post, all realm connections went through except Bloodfeather and Kor’gall/Burning Steppes/Executus, which needs a little more time. We'll let you know when that's back on the schedule<br />
<br />
If you are on a full realm, and not getting connected, will you receive more char slots then? Or will Blizzard sort this in another way, like merging a dead and a full realm? Seeing as, if you are on a realm getting connected you would be able to play with 22 chars at least (in cases with only two realms being connected), having them all in the same guild etc. <br />
There aren't any plans to give a bunch of extra character slots to folks on non-connected realms to my knowledge, no. In the situation you mentioned with connected realms, the limit per realm is still the same, it's just those characters have a bit more freedom with how they interact with guilds or characters on a different realm (the one they're connected to). <br />
<br />
Full realms will not be connected with any other realms, that would just make queues worse.<br />
<br />

PvP Gear in WoD<br />
What matters is that the gear takes the same amount of time (mean, median, and mode), and therefore effort, to acquire regardless of what you do to get it; an instance is an instance is an instance, and what you do in that instance doesn't mean a god-damned thing. Using strict Item Level parity as the benchmark is how you get from here to there.<br />
Of course it matters what you do.<br />
<br />
How do you reconcile time investment in the two tasks when they don't require the same of you to complete? How are small group sports analogous to large-team puzzle solving? How is spending a week or weeks wiping on a boss comparable to a matchmade PvP game where you're going against human opponents of similar skill?<br />
<br />
Both require mastery of your class and coordination, but you can't cross out the type and manner of gameplay as common denominators and say it doesn't matter. Of course it does.

Login Screen Music<br />
So I was listening to the login music from the past expansions and it seems to me that Blizz uses it as a overture to all the music to the current and the last expansion. Anybody else notice this or am I just nerd raging for no point <br />
In interviews in the past, Russell Brower has discussed how he likes to keep the original idea of the login music (the theming and key elements) and build on it with each new expansion. There's an expectation of hearing a certain style of music that says to people that they're logging in to World of Warcraft. It evokes emotions in many people and so he's said he doesn't want to take that away but instead, enhance and add to it with each of the expansions. If you sit and listen to the whole thing, you'll find that you've ended up on a journey of sorts through World of Warcraft history. It tells you about where you've been and where you are now or are going to depending on where you are in your gameplay. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/289254-login-music/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/11224123022?page=1#5))<br />

A Day in the Life of Blizzard<br />
Would a fly-on-the-wall developer meeting series be possible? Let us see one of the fabled sit downs, if it is very clearly stated that what is being discussed is just ideas maybe the community could handle it. <br />
I can see how something like that would be cool. In reality though experiments like the recent &quot;WoW Source&quot; interviews would be closer to the final product than our weekly CM meetings with the developers. There's a certain production value and level of professionalism we want to achieve with any official Blizzard video, and not only are our meetings very informal, they're meant to accomplish something a little different than any public-facing interview. It's not really in anyone's best interest for us to repurpose those meetings for public consumption.<br />
<br />
Nah. I've seen people throw darts to make important decisions before. At least, that's what I hope they're doing. If they're actually thinking about it, we're all in big trouble with the major rework going into WOD. <br />
<br />
It's funny to hear blizzard (a multi-billion dollar company) talking about resources. But then again they are so stingy they can't hire a few programmers to fix bugs that have been around since vanilla, and they just recycle content over and over (see hearthstone, diablo 3 etc). <br />
<br />
Aka - We only NET about 95 Million dollars per month...Clearly we don't have enough resources for ANYTHING like this... <br />
Reality is often quite a bit more complicated than these clever little narratives devoid of facts people like to conjure up. I wish we could get together and chat about that in greater detail some day. I'm sure the three of you would exercise patience and understanding should the opportunity arise.<br />
<br />
Would be awesome to get a real glimpse of what it's like behind the scenes, but I wouldn't believe it. <br />
Sadly, there's quite a bit that can't be shared and/or you would find terribly boring. I've been neck deep in spreadsheets and planning documents as are many others. &quot;Behind the scenes&quot; would involve a lot of photos of people staring at computer screens, sounds of frantic typing, email notifications flickering across the screen, instant messages, and meetings involving spreadsheets and planning documents. There's a lot of work that goes on and not as much shenanigans as some would like to hope for, but as Zarhym said, we do try to give more glimpses into individuals and what they do at Blizzard when we can. We'll keep working toward that end as much as possible for you.

Was the Elemental Focus buff not actually added? The tool-tip in game still shows 15% instead of 20%<br />
The Elemental and Death Knight buffs won't show up in tooltips until the next patch, unfortunately. It is live though. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/420677996886777856))<br />
Weird question: Why does it show up in the Aspect of the Hawk-Tooltip? Normally it needs a patch to update it!<br />
Difference in how they're built under the hood, whether they're built to be extensible by other spells or not. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/420709137165479936))<br />
<br />
With the &quot;ability bloat&quot; being removed. Can we expect major / minor rotation changes for classes in WOD?<br />
Some specs may see no rotation changes, others may see significant rotation changes. I wouldn't expect any 'overhauls' though. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/420622256557924353))<br />
&quot;mages will no longer be able to assign anything to the 3 key as they no longer need that many bindings.&quot;<br />
Perhaps I'm odd, but if I were limited to two keybinds, they'd be 2 and 3. Button 1 is always some utility/movement button. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/420623574152396800))<br />

Am I wrong in thinking those dk buffs favor unholy over frost?<br />
Slightly, which helps balance them better. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/420457008295206912))<br />
<br />
Many DKs don't seem to enjoy the awkwardness of Plague Leech. Is it here to stay? many seem to want it to go the way of the dodo<br />
We recognize that some people find it awkward to use, and some don't. That's fine for an optional talent. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/420438971613581313))<br />
<br />
To confirm: Icy Talons was buffed because Frost AoE is in a good place and to keep parity b/w DW &amp; 2h?<br />
That's a decent summary; yeah. It was a knob that affects both DW and 2H fairly evenly, and results in them being closer. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/420368307984666624))<br />

No, Moonkins are performing pretty well right now. Not amazing single target, but still quite good in most situations. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/420370559944245248))<br />

Aye, the hunter buff is just across the board for all hunters. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/420360900529250304))<br />
So, five out of six tiers in a row for Hawk buffs. Think there might be a bit bigger of an underlying problem, perhaps?<br />
We use Hawk as a buff knob because it's a safe, consistent way to do it, without any unintended sideeffects on rotations. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/420372643699630080))<br />
I think you mean you use Hawk because hunters do not, dare I say it?, scale well with gear and fall behind as each tier goes on.<br />
Buffing Hawk is a buff to Hunter scaling rate. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/420427637513654272))<br />

ret still need cast time for rep and TE, does this really balance in PVP for a melee class?<br />

I like all these dps buffsbut can you nerf disc priests while you're at it?<br />
We discussed this heavily. We prefer not to make nerfs that aren't bugfixes this far into a tier; bad for guilds close to a kill. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/420365175804293120))<br />
Can we take this to mean that, at SOME point we will get a disc rebalancing? Even if it's not now?<br />
Yes. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/420435645253681153))<br />
<br />
did you forget shadow priest on that list?<br />
Didn't forget Shadow; they're not underperforming. Their performance varies significantly between fights, but overall good. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/420360606294630401))<br />
hrm, do you think a single target buff would make them too strong on some fights?<br />
Yes, Shadow's pure single target is lower than others, but they still end up doing quite well on average. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/420363254221656064))<br />

http://blue.mmo-champion.com/public/style_images/master/tracker/flags/us-en.png Free Character Migrations Available<br />
Update - While Free Character Migrations opened this morning as planned, the page to initiate a transfer is currently and inexplicably inoperable, displaying a maintenance message. We're continuing to investigate the cause, but don't have a current estimate for when the FCMs will be available. We'll provide an update and re-post the announcement on the front page of the site once they are, though.<br />
<br />
If you're on one of the source realms listed below, you can move your characters to one of the designated destination realms and avoid the queues -- for free!<br />
<br />
By initiating one of these transfers, you will be moving your character to a new realm and home. This is a one-time, one-way move. If you wish to move your character elsewhere, you will need to use the paid transfer service.<br />

Bleeding Hollow =&gt; Korgath<br />
Darkspear =&gt; Korgath<br />
<br />
<br />
Please be aware that, due to the unpredictable nature of free transfers, we may close down any Free Character Migrations at any time and without warning if the target realm becomes full. If you plan to move with friends or your guild, we suggest that you coordinate the effort to reduce the chance of any stragglers being left behind.<br />
<br />
Early closures aside, this set of Free Character Migrations will end on Wednesday, January 22.<br />

<br />
That's kinda a good thing. This has been what has kept hunters consistent for many tiers. Every other class needs all sorts of specific spell retooling and remodeling so that they can compete at all levels, where hunters are scaled properly entirely based off this one buff. It's a very easy fix to all problems hunter related.<br />
<br />
It does pose as a problem when it continually scales up the value of Agility/AP on gear though, at this rate it won't be long before you skip socket bonuses to get agi no matter what.</div></div><hr />

WSG = has always been about the luck of the draw(as alliance i always seemed to loose cause horde always had 2 FC, 4 healers and 4 OP dps)<br />
AB = was also horrible as alliance when not in a premade cause no one cares about defending a base/flag<br />
EotS = See AB<br />
IoC = i always liked the complexion of this one cause there is not really 1 way to win. you dont need all people in the BG to pay attention.<br />
SotA = to many 20 minute draws.<br />
Twin peak = WSG 2.0<br />
Battle of Gilneas = same problem as AB. alliance rarely able to cap 2 flag and defend.<br />
Silvershard Mines = like this one aswell. because you have a decent chance of making a comeback of you just push hard enough. and it's always fun to piss of some horde by changing the track last second.<br />
Temple of Kotmogu = it's different, and i like different in this case. i personally don't get this one enough when i sign up for a random BG. it's fast paced and you can either have a close battle or get a easy quick win/loose.<br />
Deepwind Gorge = never done this one cause i simply don't have the time to pvp that much the last few months.<br />
i gave my vote to temple of kotmogu, but Silvershard is a good 2nd choice and Isle is my 3rd favorite.</div></div><hr />

Buffing Hawk is a buff to Hunter scaling rate. (Source)&quot;<br />
<br />
Thank you for finally giving me an official source to link to when I get asked why I'm lagging behind in recount. All I have to say: Sorry guys! Please have patience with me until Blizzard decides to buff Hawk, then I'll be able to catch up with you. Inconvinient, I know, I know...<br />
<br />
Buffing Hawk might be an easy fix, but it is frustrating to know that I can play as good as I can and I'll still get left behind because of this issue. And that IS a problem, not only for a single player but also for a raid-team.</div></div><hr />

As for the Battegrounds, in Classic it would have been Alterac Valley no question, it was literally like being a unit in a Warcraft III game.

&quot;Blizzard employs X artists. If some of those work on Silvermoon, then something else isn't going to get made.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Even hiring more artists still makes the choice between working on something old or something new.&quot;<br />

<br />
So basically everyone(mostly blizz, but who pays them yadayada) is paying for this crap, but you have to pay a second time to actually get it.<br />
<br />
Optional mounts versus better things for everyone does not seem like a good way to stop the erosion of subs.<br />

Bunch of whiners is what they are. I haven't played a single AV game in the past... well, a pretty damn long time that was decided because of &quot;Alliance-favoring imbalance.&quot; The horde barely even try in Alterac Valley anymore. Same goes for Isle of Conquest.</div></div><hr />

Alterac Valley is plenty of fun for Alliance. I enjoy making the horde squirm. Hell, you can pretty easily force a turtle and grind them down into dust. It's quite enjoyable.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Strand of the Ancient: same case as AV, npc's and tower's got weaker over time, the map is more of a rush than it is fighting back, currently having the wall's is a disadvantage and the match is just not fun, it was not even that good to begin with but grew worse over time since it was simply just auto scaled with level's rather than taking a look and re-balancing it.<br />
<br />
Arathi Basin: a very well made map that goes back all the way to the first battleground's. it has been popular since due to the difference between all bases where each base grants a minor advantage and something negative, like the mine's grant you the possibility to capture it but the enemy cant see whether or not you are there even after capturing it so it put's extra pressure on other bases. the blacksmith serves as a spotter/tactic, where you can spot from a distance and guide your team or simply use as a shortcut. the lumber mill server's as a flight post where you can levitate/slow fall quickly toward's nearby bases should they weaken or be in trouble.<br />
<br />
Warsong Gulch: perhaps the most interesting yet balanced fight you can have, it offers the possibility for a team to go all out in a center/base fight or to ninja a flag or tank it through, due to its simplicity it offers a wide area of tactic's<br />
<br />
silvershard mines: an interesting map that display's a lot of options for tactic's however the minecart bug that occurs if you flip a switch just when it is turning still occurs from time to time when it turns the other way around and goes back all the way rather than towards a deposit.<br />
<br />
Temple of kotmungu: a great map indeed, the creativity is unique and remind's of the first pvp map's if you compare the re-play ability or tactics you can play in them.<br />
<br />
<br />
note: all in all i gotta say the map's added during mists of pandaria remind me of the creativity of the old first battleground map's they are fun to play and can be replayed without getting you bored with multiple tactics. on the other hand they are still letting AV/SotA die by simply auto balancing and nerfing thing's rather than thinking of those who play for the skill and fun it require's, the fight's have turned into a rush for time rather than a long battle as the map's appeal to and worked the best with, so many map's yet no long map's that last hour's you can join or leave during the fight's. think back on the epic battles from alterac that all remember, there are even some who play on fake server's to achieve/obtain that old feeling again where gear was not everything and npc's where not as similar to critter's as they are now but where you had to think once in awhile if you would encounter 5-10 npc's with aoe slowly taking them down risking your life or wait for backup. now you can aoe or kill them one by one without loosing any health... bring back skill and effort</div></div><hr />

&quot;Blizzard employs X artists. If some of those work on Silvermoon, then something else isn't going to get made.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Even hiring more artists still makes the choice between working on something old or something new.&quot;<br />

So basically everyone(mostly blizz, but who pays them yadayada) is paying for this crap, but you have to pay a second time to actually get it.<br />
<br />
Optional mounts versus better things for everyone does not seem like a good way to stop the erosion of subs.<br />
<br />
Thoughts?<br />
<br />
That's exactly how it looks for me. 100 devs get transferred to WoW; expansion gets postponed; ingame shop and a new mount in it are implemented as a priority. You might not want to purchase the mount but some of your money (not much but still) has gone towards it anyways. Blizzard is a marketing genius.</div></div><hr />

It doesn't ask wich is the BG you win easier, more probably a lot of veterans are voting, since the vanilla bgs are winning, and AV, especially some time ago, was by far the more enjoyable and complete pvp experience in WoW.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's showing on the launcher as available in game now; I reckon it got pulled due to some kind of store bug rather than early release, and the knock-on effect is that sales are driven up because people think they're getting something when they shouldn't.</div></div><hr />

i gotta agree with you there that i c ant see why AV is winning, it is easy free honor for player's who dont wish to play pvpsince the entire team rushes to the boss and kill's.<br />
<br />
i could however understand if they meant the vanilla version and how challenging it could be with worthy reward's. hard work through many day's just to get some reward's as well as the fights that lasted multiple hours and team efforts that went into collecting and improving your allies like buff's npc spawns npc rescue and so on that could not just be beaten by a single player but required multiple player's since they posed a great threat especially the giant's. all mechanics still exist but where killed by changing the game into &quot;time rush&quot; rather than &quot;raid vs raid&quot; world fight, in fact they could remove every mechanic except tower's and boss and nobody would really notice anything, honestly i am wondering who went and took a dump on AV that was so well designed yet it became degraded to being the lowest desired battleground except for honor farming...</div></div><hr />

I see there is a lot of Alliance over here...<br />
<br />
<br />
Nah, I'm horde and I always loved AV. The problem about AV is that one side needs coordination while the other can just PVE-Rush and win...this is why it's not balanced. It's a great battleground and much more interesting than the others...it just needs to be fixed.<br />
<br />
I think most of the votes go for the great battle AV can be....not for the PVE-Rush AV usually is(cause PVE-Rush is the best option for alliance and horde players behave like lemmings following bots to their final defeat over and over again).<br />
<br />
Same with isle of conquest. As long as one side has an advantage by just going PVE while the other side needs to enforce PvP to win, the game is not balanced. The horde would have equal chances on both battlegrounds if they would all go for the pvp...unfortunately half of them believe they got a serious chance with a PVE-rush too...and lose. This is not horde-specific tho...if the horde would have the PVE-rush advantage on both battlegrounds then the alliance would screw it up just like that too. Hoping that PvP will happen if only one faction has to enforce pvp(to have a serious chance to win) just doesn't work....</div></div><hr />

It also seems quite balanced in terms of defence boredom, i.e. its unlikely you will become bored defending one point because its most likely will be attacked just now. That isnt true for other base-BGs like ab and eye.<br />
From the flag games WSG is my favorite, twin peaks quite less, former seems a bit more balanced and joyful.<br />
MoPBGs probably silvershard mines, but I think there could be more things in that BG - there are so much unused space and different hidden paths, but there's no point because its all bout the meat battle near the carts. Still fine though.<br />

Classic isn't always better. This is especially the case in World of Warcraft, I really like most of the newer battlegrounds. Twin Peaks is a lot better than Warsong Gulch, Battle for Gilneas is a lot more fun than Arathi Basin. Temple of Kotmogu is really awesome as well, a lot of action all the time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Arathi basin is Awesome and the best king of the hill<br />
<br />
Av and isle of conquest I never play those pve zerg faceroll matchs. AV used to be cool LONG LONG AGO. except now its a run to the boss pve race crap often you don't even pvp sometimes you 20vs 1 stupid alliance/horde who didn't join the boss killing train. if teams focus too much on defending they become super long turtles with too little honor per hour gains although can be fun if you are ranged.<br />
<br />
Strand and eyes of the storm: mixed feeling since people can't seem to figure it out and some matches are pretty fun. eyes might have too many objectives.<br />
<br />
Gilneas: the three base king of the hill imo isn't quite nearly as epic as its 5 base equivalent because there is almost not enough objectives to take care of. however its pretty similar and still good.<br />
<br />
The other 2 new bgs are alright in my book a moving king of the hill and a king of the hill with flag(gold) a la eots though I like it more I think.<br />
<br />
Temple of kotmogu is awesome! closest thing to a death match! give more!</div></div><hr />

Fun fact: Silvershard Mines is based off the Payload game type in Team Fortress 2. It's even called &quot;Payload&quot; on the BG list!</div></div><hr />

<br />
But Warsong Gulch has always been my favourite as its capture the flag at its best,&quot;will i make it home,will i get to the flag,will i get camped in my own base&quot; its all fun.<br />
<br />
Worst battleground has got to be Silvershard mines,that bg is so retarded its unreal,and being a stealther i can do fuck all to capture a mine cart by hiding so its useless. A close second is Temple of Kotmogu as horde just seem to grab every orb and sit in the middle n alliance are like,&quot;wtf we do im stupeeeeeeed&quot;.<br />
<br />
Also just to touch on a note that has severely pissed me off lately,those fucking russian teams that are obviously premades that win EVERY FUCKING GAME that they are in,cant they stay in their own battlegroup instead of being grouped with us in western europe,english v english,german v german etc because lets face it they are tough as fucking nails to beat!</div></div><hr />

Except for Isle of Conquest, I've never lost to a Russian team. Seeing as you're saying that stealth classes can't do much in Silvershard Mines, I'd say it's a case of learn to play.</div></div><hr />

Wsg is probably next on that list even though it is amlost the opposite! my verdict is still out on the Pandaren Bg's but i prefer Deepwind to the others which tend to feel a bit one sided.</div></div><hr />

Clearly its a case of learn your facts before you try to say something smart,as everybody (but you) knows you cant capture towers or carts or anything else for that matter in stealth....idiot.</div></div><hr />
