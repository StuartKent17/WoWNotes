Activision Blizzard Earnings Call<br />
The quarterly Activision Blizzard earnings call was today:<br />
<br />
<br />
Activision Blizzard had 447 million Monthly Active Users (MAUs) in the quarter<br />
Blizzard had its highest annual MAUs in 2016 at 36 million, up 37% from 2015 and up 87% since 2014. <br />
Blizzard achieved record fourth-quarter MAUsA of 41 million. <br />
Overwatch became Blizzard’s fastest game ever to reach over 25 million players globally. <br />
Overwatch broke the previous launch year record for unit sales set by Diablo III in 2012 and received 55 “Game of the Year” awards. <br />
Overwatch had its second and third seasonal events, Halloween Terror and Winter Wonderland, each one driving new records for engagement with the game. <br />
World of Warcraft MAUs grew 10% in 2016 and over 20% year-over-year in the fourth quarter on the back of the successful third-quarter launch of Legion. <br />
World of Warcraft saw an increase in total play time for the quarter, surpassing the Q3 expansion launch quarter and all non-launch quarters in the last four years. <br />
Hearthstone had its highest annual MAUs in 2016, growing more than 20%.<br />
Blizzard’s fourth-quarter play time surpassed the previous record set in the third quarter. <br />
Blizzard had record levels of quarterly and full-year in-game revenues, driven by World of Warcraft in-game content and continued strength of Overwatch customization items. <br />
Activision Blizzard revenues from in-game content reached a record $3.6 billion in 2016, more than double the $1.6 billion in 2015. Excluding King, revenues from in-game content grew 30% year-over-year. <br />

Patch 7.1.5 Hotfixes - February 9<br />
Dungeons and Raids<br />
<br />
The Nighthold<br />
<br />
Star Augur Etraeus<br />
The following abilities’ damage have been lowered by 33%, and scale up to 1.5x their new values for Raid Finder, Normal, and Heroic difficulties:<br />
<br />
Coronal Ejection<br />
Shatter<br />
Fel Impact<br />
Comet Impact<br />
Iceburst<br />
Felburst<br />
<br />
Developers’ notes: These changes are aimed at reducing the difficulty of the Star Augur Etraeus encounter for smaller raid groups, which may have fewer tools to deal with the damage output of these mechanics, without significantly changing anything for large groups.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Holiday<br />
<br />
All versions of &quot;Crushing the Crown&quot; should now grant the achievement &quot;Dangerous Love.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Player versus Player<br />
<br />
Monk<br />
<br />
(Hotfix in testing) Incendiary Brew will no longer be removed after a Breath of Fire cast.<br />
(Hotfix in testing) Dragonfire Brew's area of effect now matches Breath of Fire.<br />
(Hotfix in testing) Double Barrel now gains the benefit of the Smashed artifact trait.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Developer Communication Improvements<br />
We've been working extremely hard to improve communication. I'm sorry that you're not seeing all of it, so here's a short off-the-top-of-my-head rundown of what we've done in just the past month:<br />
<br />
1) Increased Blizzard presence on the PTR forums at least 10-fold compared to 7.1.5<br />
2) Added the Class Development forum to discuss changes that aren't necessarily tied to the PTR<br />
3) More than tripled the frequency of responses via WarcraftDevs compared to the 7.1.5 timeframe<br />
4) Re-introduced the PTR Patch Notes<br />
5) Started posting PTR Development Notes to give insight into what each build is bringing<br />
6) Made significant changes to Community team structure, and formed a team dedicated entirely to developer communications (on the PTR and Class Development forums, that's Kaivax and me)<br />
7) Revamped several of our internal feedback delivery processes to make sure that when you post something, the developers see it<br />
8) Significantly increased the rate of communication between our Community and development teams, so that CM's can be much more informed on the changes to the game (and take on more of the burden of communication ourselves)<br />
<br />
On the list to still do in the next month or so:<br />
1) Significantly increase CM presence on the forums, now that we're more able to answer questions ourselves<br />
2) Begin posting more direct requests for feedback, as 7.2 development has begun to reach a state where we're testing more than just stability (I'll be posting a thread asking for 7.2 Artifact Trait feedback later today)<br />
3) Dramatically increase the rate of live developer Q&amp;As as we get closer to 7.2 release (similar to what we did leading up to Legion launch)<br />
4) Explore new methods for communication, especially for complicated topics like Class Balance or often-overlooked topics like RP, both of which don't fit well into a standard live Q&amp;A<br />
5) Improve our internal knowledge tracking resources so that everyone posting in blue text is on the same page (this sounds a hell of a lot easier than it actually is at a company the size of Blizzard)<br />
<br />
Again, I'm really sorry and disappointed that the work we're doing isn't always coming across to you. I'm confident that things will continue to improve, especially as we grow more accustomed to our new processes. A huge part of this is also identifying pain points - you're absolutely right that there are several specs that deserve answers, and we haven't been doing enough to say &quot;yes, that's an issue, we'll talk about it&quot; or &quot;no, we disagree, for these reasons.&quot;<br />
<br />
I just wanted you to be aware that this is absolutely a priority for us, for the WoW development team, and for Blizzard as a whole. We've been working our butts off to make it happen. I'm sorry it hasn't happened as quickly as all of us may have liked, or possibly in the way that everyone was expecting, but I do think we've improved fairly dramatically since 7.1.5, and we will continue to do so.<br />
<br />
After over a year of feedback from people talking about how much people dislike Vulnerable, we should never see a tweet like this one from Muffinus:<br />
To clarify this - Muffinus is a great guy who does a lot of really important work on WoW, but is not on the class design team. What you saw in that tweet was him just trying to find out what the issue was so that he, as a swell dude who wants to help, could ask the class devs about it. It was very much not &quot;the guy who makes Hunters didn't know what Hunters were upset about.&quot;<br />
<br />
Also a quick suggestion to add to new patch notes: Stealth Changes. NEVER DO THIS. EVER. We will find them and call you guys (the devs) out on them. Please do document ALL changes, even if it's a 0.01% change; at least put them in an &quot;extened patch notes&quot; that are readily available.<br />
This is absolutely, categorically, unfailingly and without exception, NEVER intentional. Most commonly, it happens because something simply got missed (see my previous note about revamping internal communication processes). Other times, it happens because a simple bugfix has unforeseen consequences.<br />
<br />
I just wanted to be clear that &quot;lets nerf this spec and just not tell them&quot; is not a strategy we employ. As you said, even if we wanted to, it wouldn't work anyway.<br />
<br />
Can Healers please receive dev attention?<br />
<br />
Everything we see, everything we read, all feedback, all dev posts, it is always about DPS.<br />
<br />
Why do the devs ignore Healer feedback and focus only on DPS?<br />
You totally read my mind. I've lately been asking this same question.<br />
<br />
The answer seems to be kind of simple: with activities like healing or maintaining aggro or crowd control, a spec either has the capacity to do enough, or it doesn't. There's a sort of binary &quot;working or not working&quot; aspect to it. Yes, healing is much more complicated than activating a taunt every time it's up, but in general, you don't see many healers pointing at healing meters and feeling bad. They have the capacity to do enough healing. Also, there's constantly a cap on how much effective healing you can do.<br />
<br />
But there are some concerns, and we're keeping an eye out for them here and elsewhere. I've observed discussion among our class designers about all six healing specs at some point over the last month, and of course, it was abundant during development of patch 7.1.5 (November and December).<br />
<br />
Here are some threads in this forum that we've been following:<br />

Class Changes in Patch 7.2<br />
We're planning to have relatively minimal changes to core class design in 7.2. This is for two primary reasons:<br />
<br />
<br />
The 7.2 changes and additions to Artifact Traits will have a lot of impact on classes, and so we'd like to keep core functionality relatively stable We just made a very significant amount of changes to most specs in 7.1.5, and don't want to pile another heap of changes on the community just yet.<br />
<br />
That's not to say that there won't be any class changes in 7.2, just that it's not a major focus of the patch the same way it was in 7.1.5. As someone mentioned above, our strategy for Legion is to keep those sorts of heavy class changes to 7.x.5-level patches.<br />
<br />
I should add, however, that we're already getting fairly deep into discussions on what might happen in one such future patch, so please keep the feedback coming. Kaivax alluded to some of those discussions regarding Unholy in an earlier post, for example.<br />
<br />
I also wanted to address this specifically, since it's the sort of thing that hasn't really been visible outside of here at the office:<br />
<br />
Their class team egos are way too large to realize that they aren't all knowing and haven't created the perfect classes that exactly fit the class fantasy and play perfectly.<br />
We have conversations literally every day about things that could have or should have been done differently, and things to want to change in the future. Just because we're overall happy with class balance as a nebulous concept at the moment doesn't mean we don't recognize that there are still issues to address.<br />
<br />
Does this mean no tuning changes are imminent? If so that's heartbreaking to some classes like mages. We need to know soon so the rerolls can commence.<br />
Tuning changes are done primarily via hotfix these days (excepting the ones that need to be done after core mechanical changes are made). So no, that's not what that means.<br />
<br />
I already gave up on expecting a major revision to Hunters this expansion.<br />
We are not planning to completely re-design Hunters this expansion.<br />
<br />
We are, however, regularly discussing the feedback we're seeing on things like Vulnerable with the intention of finding ways to improve the situation.<br />

Talent Choices<br />
In my opinion talents from the tree should provide interesting choices. I don't really see how Rune of power, Incanter's flow, Erosion, Lonely Winter, Bone chilling and Arctic Gale are supposed to be fun or interesting.<br />
<br />
In most cases you just pick these talents to improve a different talent: for example you always pick Rune of power together with Overpowered.<br />
<br />
Why not just buff spells or talents that are used with flat damage talents, remove those talents and replace them with actual spells or effects that are fun to play with?<br />
I'd actually argue that the Mirror Image/Rune of Power/Incanter's Flow row fits in line pretty well with how talent rows (at least those focused on throughput) should work. You've got:<br />
<br />
One option that's tough to use but highly effective when used well (Rune of Power) One that's pretty straightforward but still allows for a little bit of optimization (Incanter's Flow) And one that's very simple and reliable, even if it doesn't always have the same maximum potential as the other options (Mirror Image).<br />
<br />
Not all rows are designed that way - sometimes it's a choice between single target and AoE, sometimes it's a choice between different types of movement, and sometimes we mix several types of options together to try to create tough choices - but in general, we like that sort of interaction.<br />
<br />
One thing we haven't always gotten across clearly is that we don't expect all types of players to enjoy all types of talents. If you're a top-tier Mage running Mythic Nighthold, and can use Rune of Power effectively (finding opportune moments to drop it and saving procs, cooldowns, etc for those moments), it's okay if you're using it on every encounter.<br />
<br />
We try to make sure there's at least some variation in the tree somewhere (e.g. maybe you prefer Arcane Orb instead of Overpowered on a fight like Skorpyron), but it's okay if you settle on a set of talents you feel are the &quot;best.&quot; Chances are high that they're not the best for everyone, and that's the sort of character customization that systems like the talent tree can do well.<br />
<br />
I agree with variation and I think mostly it works fairly well, however....<br />
<br />
What about where a talent is still mandatory, and you won't ever see anyone Raiding using anything else* Isn't that a case of a design flaw, and something that you'd think would of been corrected by now by adjusting the other two talents (I say adjust, rather than just nerf the current best one, so its useless, and the others become good by comparison)<br />
<br />
I'll throw an easy example out there, Marksman Hunter, Lone Wolf...<br />
I wouldn't necessarily call it a design flaw. There's a few talents that we don't expect people to take in PvE, but are very popular in PvP (Mistwalk comes to mind, although it might be TOO strong in PvP at the moment). There's some talents that a top-tier Mythic raider might find mandatory, but a more average player might be better served taking something easier to use. Rune of Power is a good example there, I think.<br />
<br />
That said, when nearly everyone (in all aspects of gameplay, not just raiding) is taking a talent, then yeah, there's probably something wrong there. Occasionally it's that one talent is too good, and occasionally it's that the others are too weak. Those are -- usually -- the places we look at when making talent changes.<br />
<br />
Lone Wolf is kind of a unique snowflake. Early on in Legion development, we actually removed pets from Marksmanship Hunters entirely. We got a lot of feedback from players excited to have the &quot;pet-free&quot; playstyle, but there were some who still wanted to be able to play Marksmanship with a pet. There were also some secondary concerns about the leveling process; at lower levels, a Hunter without a pet is just at too much of a disadvantage.<br />
<br />
We still wanted Marksmanship's &quot;default&quot; playstyle at 110 to be petless, so we brought Lone Wolf back in as a talent, and tuned it to be slightly above average in its row. Players who really wanted to play Marksmanship with a pet could opt into it, but most would lean toward the pet-free playstyle, without feeling like they were &quot;nerfing&quot; themselves for it.

Unholy Deathknight Feedback<br />
Also remove the rune cost from Army of the Dead so we can use our 10 minute DPS cooldown without gimping our rotation, thanks.<br />
<br />
This would be amazing; also that cd needs to be a 5 minute not 10. Putting your idea in OP.<br />
These threads have been read and re-read many times, and I've observed a lot of developer discussion about Unholy, and the suggestion above sticks out as one that really doesn't fit with the rest of the feedback.<br />
<br />
Army of the Dead is intended to be the most cool moment for an Unholy Death Knight. It's supposed to be powerful (and it is) and put on a big show where the UDK shines (and it does). Its cooldown and cost provides a lot of that.<br />
<br />
I just wanted you to know-- with concerns like Gargoyle feeling too weak or Virulent Plague not doing enough, there are discussions here and potential for something that we might address --but AotD seems too fun to make it less of a big deal for the player.<br />

Retribution Paladin Feedback<br />
Just wanted to thank you for the productive discussion and useful feedback here.<br />
<br />
Something to remember is that we really like the unique mechanics of Retribution. We think the spec provides a lot of flavor and makes for good stories. There's nothing quite like the strong emotional reactions people have to situations where Ret shines in a way that no other spec would have. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/798147-retribution-paladin-discussion/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20752765359?page=6#104))<br />
<br />
Retribution paladin descent in PVE<br />
Just wanted to note, since I've seen a lot of discussion about the Retribution passive lately: we consider that to mostly be a fun extra perk for flavor, and not a core part of the Retribution toolkit. By that I mean we wouldn't, for example, say: &quot;when everyone's alive Retribution is low, but sometimes people die, so Ret is fine.&quot;<br />
<br />
Just wanted to give some clarity there! (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/798164-retribution-paladin-descent-in-pve/) / Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/17614942998?page=1#6))<br />

You actually cherrypicked your data pretty hard.<br />
<br />
It having higher activity than all of Mop/wod except for launch means even during mop ToT and SoO launch which were pretty active times -- Legion Q4 is beating it. So no, legion is doing very well. But you can claim it's dying, like im sure you have been since cata.<br />

Legion is doing fine: it's profitable. You can't read this as a player, this information is for investors. <br />
<br />
<br />
last year 4th quarter was WoD and horrifically low numbers<br />
<br />
They're in the black, not red. That's the story here. Investors will know their money isn't at great risk, like if the game had lost 20% from last year. <br />
<br />
<br />
Legion only increased active players by 20% over an incredibly low activity period. Normal xpacs increase activity by 100-200%, sometimes more.<br />
<br />
They don't really care about active players, as long as they're profiting.<br />
<br />
<br />
Legion experienced massive drop off within a month as most returning players hated the reboots except for World Quests. RNG everything pissed everyone off and the death of the primary pvp reward system chased away tons and tons more. <br />
<br />
None of this matters to investors. This is about the price and value of Blizzard stock, not the content of the games.<br />
<br />
<br />
Legion costs more than MoP yet contains less content by almost 50%. Legion has extra grinds but not content. Legion is where they made everything take longer to get.<br />
<br />
The investors have no fucks to give for &quot;the grind&quot;. <br />
<br />
<br />
Why can't wow just put out MoP level content every xpac instead of rebooting systems?<br />
<br />
This is an excellent question for Ion and Brack, as they're the ones who decide that, you should try and ask it the next time there's a Q&amp;A by either of them. In an investors call, it's irrelevant. <br />
<br />
Again - this report was not for you, the players. It's for people who invested money in their stock, and want to know how healthy the company is, so they can either sell their stocks, or buy them. They don't care about the content, they care about sales and profit. According to this report, Blizzard will have a semi-strong 2017, mostly from Overwatch, and consistent sales from the Blizzard online-stores. <br />
<br />
Bitching about quests and legendaries and grinding doesn't belong here.</div></div><hr />

There isn't. FF14 can hold a sub because Square Enix are funding it and it comes off of a well known franchise. Wildstar was the only other game that at launch required a sub and well that tanked hard. Hell FF11 is still using the sub model and the biggest server has 2k players.</div></div><hr />

Yeah forgot about those 2. My point is the only other titan that has a sub is FF14 because it can. It comes off of a well known franchise and basically takes over as the MMO for Final Fantasy from 11 which was popular back then.<br />

also where did you get this &quot;mop has double the content&quot; allmost like mop is a finished expansion, and legion is not even half way trhoug hits life cycle yet.... and based on what blizz has said and shown is to come, we will habve about the same if not more raids then was in mop, aswell as the same if not more dungeons, and MUCH more world content and pvp content<br />
<br />
MoP actually had more than double. Go read up on it. Buncha comparisons already out there or you can easily compare number of raids, dungeons, scenarios, pet battles were added, faction hubs instead of re-using a city, flying as a feature instead of extreme late game useless unlock, 3 different isles added, more leveling zones, brawlers guild addition, addition of treasure and rare hunting, new class, new race, 3 new bg's, 2 new arenas, BIS pvp gear from pvp instead of pve, tons of alt shortcuts, reforging, legendary quests for everyone, spectacular visual effects on the legendary cloaks, tons of weapons for everyone instead of tiny amount of color swaps and appearances of the same weapon, etc etc<br />
<br />
Just cuz you wanna flap your gums and say legion has tons of content doesn't make it so. Legion has about half of MoP and a lot of grinds that make it longer to get virtually everything, especially RNG. Thus the large amount of burnout and people quitting. They wasted a ton of dev time on the systems reboots, similar to how they wasted a ton of time on graphics/engine reboot for WoD. <br />
<br />
Hopefully the next xpac actually delivers on content instead of mega grinds they HOPE you call content even though they are flat repetition of the same content over and over.</div></div><hr />

MoP had 6 dungeons in the entire expansion (unless you count the remakes of low level dungeons)<br />
Legion has 11<br />
<br />
How is flying considered content? How is number of zones really content? What matters is the content in the zones. Legion has a lot of alt shortcuts. Now with 7.1.5 it is easier than any expansion to get to a decent level of gear (and that includes AP now too). Reforging was cata... basically most of your post is bullshit...</div></div><hr />

I'm not, and none of my friends are. If Blizzard claims this it must be true, right?<br />
I tried killing the world boss in Aszuna yesterday, and I couldn't. No groups were up and the one I made consisted of 3 people after 10 mins of waiting. This was in prime time of gaming, around 18:00 in-game time.<br />
Zones are as deserted as, well, a desert. Orgrimmar is overpopulated with peole though, which is nice, albeit it's people from different servers crammed in one city.<br />
<br />
If people are in-game more now than at launch, where the hell are they? Idling in Silvermoon? 90% Alliance?</div></div><hr />

<br />
And yet, I an go on at roughly 8pm server time, and get a group in under 2min for the World Boss. I've also done it in past weeks at 11am, on a weekday. If you can't find them in the group finder, get close enough for the world quest to show up, and a small green eye icon will appear next to the objective to help you find a group (and this gave me 2 groups for Levantus, which I couldn't find any searching manually in the Premade Group Finder).<br />
<br />
Zones appearing &quot;deserted&quot; would you being bounced to a lower-activity world shard, due to the last one being &quot;at capacity&quot;. Any time I am out doing world quests, at least 3-5 people in any given quest spot, more at the flight paths and towns (and I don't mean capitals). Dalaran always has people swarming through it, of both factions. My order hall is packed with Paladins at all hours of the day and night.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Pets, brawlers, legendary chain..most of that is still around or in a different form. It's still neglactable content. It's not like you were farming pets, brawlers and your legendary chain all the time. The Legion legendary weapons actually have more models and skins combined than any raidtier did in the past. Artifacts won't beat an expansion worth of weapon drops but they're still more interesting than just equipping a new weapon every now and then(which most people transmogged anyway)<br />
<br />
I agree on the reforging and pvp gear, that added alot more gameplay depth and choice. Normalised pvp is boring af. I'll play a different game if I want balanced pvp.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's the only takeaway from this thing. MAUs is a nice number to boast for every other Blizzard title, where you don't pay after getting the game (or at all). For WoW, the only metric of success is subs. If the game can keep more people for a longer period of time, it's a success. If it grabs loads of players but falls off (like WoD), the hype was successful.<br />
<br />
<br />
The only numbers they gave were an increase in players from 2015 to 2016. No shit. WoD launched with a gigantic comeback of subs only to drop off rapidly after launch. The 6.1 Twitter patch didn't exactly mend any wounds. Keeping players online for longer isn't a metric to gauge the games success. It only adds to the idea that the grind feels forced. Monthly active users is nice, but ultimately feels more like there are more people playing for a smaller amount of time.<br />
<br />
<br />
WoW isn't dying by any means, but it's being cut up piece by piece slowly. It's still by magnitudes the biggest MMO and will stay that way for years. Growing from 2015 to 2016 means it's probably over 5 mil subs(I don't have the last numbers they published available), maybe even 6+mil which I suppose we will see if will last (aka will they post MAUs in the next one if MAUs tank?).</div></div><hr />

yes.. .but the game is still allmost 13 years old... how many other games are 13 years old and anything as successful?<br />
For Christ's sake, I know the knee-jerk reaction is to be as positive as possible and make WoW seem like the best thing from sliced bread but, they don't need you to enact typical fan PR spin.<br />

<br />
Thats bullshit.<br />
<br />
Even when subs were at their lowest during WoD, profits were up due to microtransactions. <br />
<br />
In fact, they even mention that in game transactions are massive.<br />
<br />
<br />
Activision Blizzard revenues from in-game content reached a record $3.6 billion in 2016, more than double the $1.6 billion in 2015<br />
<br />
Subs, havent been tied to good earnings in a very long time so just stop that nonsense.<br />
<br />
The fact theyve changed the reporting metric and are using lots of inclusive reporting language is fairly telling.<br />

<br />
MoP actually had more than double. Go read up on it. Buncha comparisons already out there or you can easily compare number of raids, dungeons, scenarios, pet battles were added, faction hubs instead of re-using a city, flying as a feature instead of extreme late game useless unlock, 3 different isles added, more leveling zones, brawlers guild addition, addition of treasure and rare hunting, new class, new race, 3 new bg's, 2 new arenas, BIS pvp gear from pvp instead of pve, tons of alt shortcuts, reforging, legendary quests for everyone, spectacular visual effects on the legendary cloaks, tons of weapons for everyone instead of tiny amount of color swaps and appearances of the same weapon, etc etc<br />
<br />
Just cuz you wanna flap your gums and say legion has tons of content doesn't make it so. Legion has about half of MoP and a lot of grinds that make it longer to get virtually everything, especially RNG. Thus the large amount of burnout and people quitting. They wasted a ton of dev time on the systems reboots, similar to how they wasted a ton of time on graphics/engine reboot for WoD. <br />
<br />
Hopefully the next xpac actually delivers on content instead of mega grinds they HOPE you call content even though they are flat repetition of the same content over and over.<br />
<br />
again... mop is a finished fucking expansion... legion isnt even half way done yet... comparing an expansion that had allmost 3 years in it, to one that isnt even 1 year old yet.... holy shit...</div></div><hr />

I had both ends of this experience yesterday over the course of about an hour. I went to fight the world boss in Azuna on one toon, got in a group of 40 instantly and finished in a few minutes. About 45 minutes later I went out on an alt and could not find a group at all. I waited about an hour for the next wave of people to start up questing and finished up with no problem. I think you were probably in the same timeframe of early afternoon when people were still getting home from school/work.</div></div><hr />

<br />
last year 4th quarter was WoD and horrifically low numbers<br />
<br />
Legion only increased active players by 20% over an incredibly low activity period. Normal xpacs increase activity by 100-200%, sometimes more.<br />
<br />
Legion experienced massive drop off within a month as most returning players hated the reboots except for World Quests. RNG everything pissed everyone off and the death of the primary pvp reward system chased away tons and tons more. <br />
<br />
Legion costs more than MoP yet contains less content by almost 50%. Legion has extra grinds but not content. Legion is where they made everything take longer to get.<br />
<br />
Why can't wow just put out MoP level content every xpac instead of rebooting systems?<br />
<br />
Are you kidding me? MoP levels of content? Did you not forget the year long drought of content from SoO release to the next xpac? Where were you doing that time? There is so much to do in Legion, it's silly. There are three raids out already, THREE. That's the entire total of raids that was in the entirety of WoD and that's two less than Mists. So I don't know what you are saying there is not enough content. You must be playing the wrong game.</div></div><hr />

It's not dead, it's just not as popular as it's once been and just been normalized 1 - 2 million players is very healthy for an MMORPG you don't want too many but your correct Overwatch is the new cash cow for Blizzard.<br />

<br />
No, this is a launch quarter of 2nd launch quarter just because Legion has been released just outside of the previous quarter (for cunning and not so cunning reasons) in Q3 (which was their target) to show that 4th quarter has massive success. I don't particular like the game now because it's now official became a job but all that really matters that the game is making money.<br />

To some people it matters especially census people, the ones who want to come back and since this is MMORPG it's heavily relied upon as most of the excellent content is reserved for the end game which requires a huge amount of subs. To many people it's dodging the bullet, how come they hastily revealed the exact numbers of Overwatch but used percentages to gauge the activity of WOW, it might to some people say &quot;wow has become really popular&quot; and come back only to be disappointed as the game is normalized back to a 1 - 2 million unique players consistently which is a lot but not enough for the enormous amount of servers (which is why raid finder, dungeon finder and so forth were really needed as cross over helps people to play with each other on dead servers which in turns has its ups and downs).<br />

They don't release sub numbers because regardless of any change the game is never going back to the highest statistical popularity the game had (which can be debated for a variety of objective &amp; subjective reasons), but that doesn't mean the game is not popular anymore &amp; certainly not the argument vomited ad nauseam that the game is dead. If the game was really dead the business model would no longer be profitable as not enough players would be putting forth the time and paycheck towards it. However, if Blizzard released sub numbers again all you would see is the forums flooded with face palming &quot;The sky is falling!&quot; posts because the game is no longer at 10 million+ subs. The game is better off not posting subs just for that reason alone. I'd rather have players that are clearly over the game to stay away as opposed to sticking around to just to qq over sub numbers. The game needs less toxicity in the community, not more.<br />
<br />
In the end, the game will still function in a group environment without 5, 6, 8, 10, or 12 million subs. Dungeon ques won't spontaneously rocket to 3 hour wait times, raid finder will still work, you will still see groups for current and previous content pop up for raids and dungeons, and people will still pvp (though maybe not so much in arena so long as high end brackets are plagued with cheaters and kick bots). Group content isn't breaking down anytime soon.</div></div><hr />

It's like all of those trickshot videos where they don't show the probably hundreds of takes and only the show the one that made it.<br />
<br />
This data is vague as hell and really only states that Blizzard made a fuckton of money yet people are coming up with these crazy theories out of it like they actually have a clue. I feel like I'm watching a kid try to shove a cube into a circle slot.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">longevity</div><div class="date">2017-02-11, 07:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">yeah the subs have been going down since legion release alarmingly quick<br />
<br />
they just boosted for the 1st time with the nighthold LFR unlock<br />
<br />
prior to nighthold they were equal or lower than WoD<br />
<br />
i'm not trying to insult wow or say it sucks. I'm AM trying to say that the Legion design direction, which involves quite a few grind an reward reboots, is not retaining players or bringing big numbers back to wow.<br />
<br />
WoW does not have the A team anymore. They all quit bliz or went to other bliz projects. WoW is a firm B or C team nowadays. Salty veterans are generally the complete burnouts who get no joy from wow and are phoning it in. Doesn't make them bad people. Hardly anyone can do wow dev for 10+ years without some form of burnout and fading of passion. <br />
<br />
The passionate ones have no desire to get on the old ship. They want to be on the new dreadnought.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm gonna say this and many people gonna hate me for this but the Dungeon Queues, Raid Finder and any help in search for group even though it broke down the social aspect of the game actually saved it from going under, the support and option to play solo or multi-player in the MMORPG is the one of the best aspects of WOW, everything else not so especially the story !!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
And most people stay away from crazy ex-girlfriends or boyfriends. Guess some people are just obsessed with chasing crazy, am I right?<br />
<br />
<br />
But our new gf Hearthstone has some of the best aspect of our old crazy gf and just reminds how good and fun the game was back then !!.</div></div><hr />

Anyway, as other people pointed out, played time is the highest since MoP ToT, so not dead at all. Also I'd suggest to read about the sharding tech they implied and why, you'll be surprised (one of the reasons legion had the smoothest launch)<br />
<br />
You can have half of the number of people putting in 2 times the amount of timed play. It's not hard to see that with how much grind there is in the game now. AP and Mythic + would be the main source of time played.<br />
<br />
Why Blizzard implemented it is not for the reasons they claim, it was their intention all a long to force people into CRZ and Sharding is just the same tech that creates new CRZ zones ( and a poorly designed one at that as it doesn't take faction, server type and world location into account). Please, if you believe anything that comes out of Blizzard mouth please stop, they lie on all things and will continue to do so. I don't disagree that Sharding works for the Launch of an expansion but CRZ and Sharding need to be turned off afterwards, and it's one the main reasons why i stopped playing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Means Legion is dead as well, if its only grown 10% from over WoD levels and looking at how many dead servers there is combined with the always on Cross Realm Zones being forced it's clear that WoW is at or under WoD levels for player numbers. And the main focus on Overwatch and the fact that WoW only made 20% of the overall profit for Blizzard isn't a good sign. ( 60% from Non World of Warcraft and 20% from non PC ) holy shit that is bad news. I think WoW is under WoD levels of player numbers.<br />
<br />
Looks like Overwatch is the new cash cow for Blizzard, no wonder why all of a sudden the WoW team is trying to start up communication on their own forums. Too little too late.<br />
<br />
No, it actually just means you do not read the numbers correctly. <br />
Most part of 2016 was the tail of WoD, not Legion. The numbers show that that after Legion was released the MAU rised so much that it could compensate for the low numbers from January to August 2016 and still grow 10% on an annual basis. 10% is the overall rise of 2016 over 2015, not the rise of Legion over WoD, as you mistakenly say. In fact, 4th quarter of 2016 is 20% higher than 4th quarter of 2015 (which was WoD during a phase that was more active than the first half of 2016).</div></div><hr />

As I said, go look up how and why sharding exists and works the way it works. If you have any proof of blizzard lying, please share.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
4th quarter of 2016 is the launch QUARTER for LEGION. Legion came out the end of August in 2016 30th of August, which is one month away from the end of the 3rd quarter which they were aiming for.<br />
<br />
It's just to show that WOW expansions still have life in them but outside of the launch Quarter which the 4th quarter is regardless of how you will justify it isn't (3rd quarter is July August September ( legion came out in 30th of August start of September source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_of_Warcraft:_Legion) and the 4th quarter is October November and December) So Legion was just outside the 4th quarter but still QUALIFIES as a launch quarter as 3 months count So SEPTEMBER OCTOBER NOVEMBER)<br />
<br />
It's a lot of fudging the figures on Blizzard part to show that WOW is still a viable product but the ends justifies the means that WOW is still profitable even though it isn't doing as well as they say it should and they don't mention anything else besides the rise in MAUs which was generated from other products who wanted to try the flagship franchise.<br />
<br />
No one is talking about WOW now, unfortunate but I think the whole the series need a reboot and a reset and it's long overdue and it seems that way with experimenting Diablo III abilities in Legion right now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
All this really says is that they averaged MAUs over the year in 2016. Any time they average in subs from a launch the numbers are going to look great. No kidding. <br />
<br />
The game isn't dying, but at a personal level all my friends have stopped playing, raid guilds on my server are struggling to keep their ranks filled, and queue times are through the roof for everything. That tells me that at least on my server the game isn't healthy. It's inevitable for a game this old. People rush back for an expansion hoping to recapture that old feeling and then realize it simply isn't there. WoW stays on top because people are invested in their toons, friends, and guilds.</div></div><hr />

I think people that used to raid don't have the time and patience anymore. I raided on and off for 10 years. I can't do it anymore. just isn't interesting now. lfr is fine. see the content but I don't care about gear anymore.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Activision's November release, call of duty infinite warfare, is a high-quality, innovative game that paired with modern warfare remastered offers a tremendous amount of value and game play variety. However, sales underperformed our expectations, and it is clear that for a portion of our audience, the space setting just didn't resonate. We had a passionate, experienced studio deeply committed to this direction, and despite the risks we saw, we believe it is important to consider the passions of our game teams in deciding what content to create. While it wasn't the success we planned, it allows us to protect a core tenet of our culture that Bobby discussed. [...] In 2017, Activision will take Call of Duty back to its roots, and traditional combat will once again take center stage.</div></div><hr />

Less, FFXIV:ARR reborn is beating it due to being lorewise and classwise respectable to it's roots, where as WOW is not. It's a hodgepodge mess that needed to be cleaned up.<br />
<br />
They missed that chance in Cataclysm and the game is suffering because of it.<br />
