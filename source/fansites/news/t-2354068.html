Lightsabers Return to Azeroth<br />
A recent hotfix gives many of the Orgrimmar and Stormwind guards red and blue lightsabers, or as close as you can get in WoW! <br />

<br />
WoW Alpha Update<br />
A entry for version 8.0.1.25703 of wow_alpha was added to the launcher. This is probably just another step towards a beta next year.<br />

<br />
This Week in WoW History<br />
We're taking a look back at old MMO-Champion posts and World of Warcraft news that occurred during this time in previous years.<br />
<br />
War Games<br />
The start of Arena Season 9 brought the War Games feature to WoW. This new Arena and Battleground mode is a custom game which allows players to battle it out against another group. During these skirmishes no achievements, rankings, or stats are recorder, because they are meant to just be a fun feature allowing players to challenge and fight against each other. Perhaps the most common format to rise is the 5v5 1v1s, where two teams of five people take turns dueling until there is only one team standing.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Blizzard World of Color<br />
The 2011 Blizzard holiday party was hosted at California Adventure, and the company delivered a special surprise. A Blizzard themed light show featured clips from Starcraft II, Diablo III, and World of Warcraft. Each show had a small comic bit followed by a trailer projected on the famous World of Color water fountain.<br />
<br />

<br />
Reaper of Souls<br />
Closed beta for Diablo III: Reaper of Souls opened, allowing players to opt into beta testing through their Battle.Net page for a chance at an invite. This was the first expansion pack for Diablo III, which was revealed at Gamescom in 2013. <br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Highmaul Mythic Race<br />
Imperator Mar’gok managed to live 5 days before being defeated by Paragon. Imperator Mar’gok’s secret phase brought back Cho’gall, who was defeated in the Bastion of Twilight during the Cataclysm.<br />
<br />
<br />
https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2017/december/thumb/mhighmaul.png (https://www.mmo-champion.com/content/4582-Paragon-Mythic-Highmaul-World-First) <br />
<br />
Legion PvP Overhaul<br />
Legion brought numerous changes to the PvP system, in an attempt to make it feel more rewarding. The most notable change was the addition of Honor Levels and Honor Talents. This new talent tree can be unlocked through doing PvP content that rewards Honor. These talents are only usable in PvP combat, however after unlocking all of them players could still advance their Honor Level to gain additional Prestige Levels unlocking cosmetic rewards. Along with the new system, two new arena maps were also introduced into the map pool. <br />

in Hm butcher, tectus, and brackenspore were basicly optional bosses. Only kargath ,twin ogron and ko'ragh were required to do to acces the final boss.</div></div><hr />

I disagree. As someone who never really enjoyed PVP, the Prestige system's rewards has gotten me to start doingm ore than just PVP WQs...lately I've done more PVP than PvE content and I'm enjoying it more than I had in the past.</div></div><hr />

It did, but the post probably meant first new raid with the new system. The SoO change was obviously well after progression occurred.</div></div><hr />

The cooldown is definitely too long, but on the bright side the auction house will probably be flooded with them by the time the holiday is over.</div></div><hr />

Everyone is having the issue trying to tag Grumpus. It's people all trying to get a tag in since Blizzard didn't have the foresight to see something like this happen, which should be surprising but it is Blizzard after all.</div></div><hr />

meanwhile, it feels unrewarding for everyone who actually liked PvP, which is why PvP participation is down to like a third of what it was in WoD.</div></div><hr />

I completely agree. And judging by the stats we have available, so do many players who formerly PvPed.</div></div><hr />

Yep. Which is why it's absolute bullshit that they did that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Then you should of specified it was a single arcane mage doing it and not &quot;110s&quot; since you made it sound like the fustercluck thats been going on with multiple realms. And its a dude being a dick. If you feel like it's harassment though, feel free to report it in-game as such.</div></div><hr />
