Hunter Pets now inherit 60% of the Hunter's Attack Power (up from 33%). The buff doesn't seem to affect basic attacks,intended?<br />
Yes. Basic attacks' damage are based on the master's AP. (Odd, I know.) (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/528236097994625024))<br />

PvP<br />
can you please explain why the candles would be removed from ruins of lordaeron especially in a LAN setting? MAP placement not rel?<br />
We removed some candles that people complained about getting stuck on frequently. Is that what you mean? (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/527631178300272640))<br />
why remove map based skill? Why create turret classes? Is there a serious pvp meta response?<br />
I don't agree that janky collision is map based skill. They were just annoying. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/527663294304497664))<br />
<br />
please don't force us into randoms for maximum honor. 6.0.2 was great because we got to choose BGs we liked w/o missing add. honor<br />
If specific battlegrounds give as much honor as random battlegrounds, we end up with queue time problems. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/527872232312172544))<br />

Garrisons<br />
Quick question that is VERY important. Can you have a level 3 plot on a level 2 Garrison if you have mats and blueprints? Thanks!<br />
Nope, level 3 plots require level 3 garrison, just like needing a castle to build a gryphon roost in Warcraft. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/528219848355348481))<br />

I can really relate with Hordies being sad about their art. I am actually not that happy about human stuff either, but it stands out a lot less than Garrosh furnishings do. Even the old orc art stood out less (it was also more awesome, but that's moresubjective), so there can be no doubt which race is calling the shots in the Horde one. Same with the alliance one but just not as obvious. <br />

I would love to know that too. Does anybody know?

I know the 500k damage one only works out in the world and not in raids. I didn't get around to testing the Rune of Power, but I would imagine it is the same for it, only out in the world.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As far as I got in beta the Rune of Power from the Mage Tower did not activate in dungeons and raids. The Workshop items, however, were on a case-by-case basis. Sticky Grenade Launcher, Pneumatic Power Gauntlet, GG-117 Micro-Jetpack and Robo-Rooster could be used in dungeons while all of the others could not. XD-57 &quot;Bullseye&quot; Guided Rocket and &quot;Skyterror&quot; Personal Delivery System could not because they would clearly break the dungeon/raid's walls and layouts just by using them and N.U.K.U.L.A.R. Target Painter could not because you could kill a boss ridiculously fast with a group full of people wielding them. I am not 100% sure if Sentry Turret Dispensor could be used in dungeons.<br />
<br />
Also, the Spires of Arak vendor items only work in Spires of Arak. You keep the buff if you leave Spires but they only function in that zone.</div></div><hr />

I didn't get around to testing the Rune of Power, but I would imagine it is the same for it, only out in the world.<br />

Thank you chaud. :)</div></div><hr />

Initially I was sad you couldn't name your own followers, but since there are so many of them I'm not that concerned; just will be a little low on variety for the bodyguards. :)<br />

You can get randomized followers with the Inn, where you select one of their abilities/traits.<br />
Simply build the Inn, and you can select between 3 new followers with the ability/trait you want once a week.</div></div><hr />

I want to like it I really do but this is the first expac that honestly seems to scream MEH! at me. Maybe after all these years I am simply burnt out.. Logged in twice in the last 4 months and even then I wondered why I did. Let's see what the future brings... Blizzcon might just have that golden moment that makes me want to re sub. I honestly truly hope it does.</div></div><hr />
