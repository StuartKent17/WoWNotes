Rise of Azshara PTR Progress<br />
A few minutes ago, we made the Rise of Azshara PTR available for download and install. This is so that initial testers will be completely ready to log in when the test realms are made public.<br />
<br />
We are not at that point yet, and we don’t know how long it’s going to take to complete our checks and configuration. It looks like at least a few hours.<br />
<br />
We’ll post here confirming when the PTR is playable and the PTR discussion subforums are open.<br />

<br />
Jaina<br />
<br />
Howling Winds duration increased to 10 minutes (was 2 minutes) on all difficulties.<br />
Gathering Blizzard's progress is now reset at the start of the second intermission on Mythic difficulty.<br />
Ice Block health lowered by 25% on Mythic difficulty.<br />
Shattering Lance charge up time increased to 9 seconds (was 8 seconds) on Mythic difficulty.<br />

Stormwall Blockade<br />

<br />
<br />

<br />
Fixed a bug that prevented players from looting the Gordok Tribute chest in Dire Maul.<br />
<br />
<br />
The MOTHERLODE!!<br />
<br />
Mogul Razdunk<br />

<br />
Items<br />
<br />
Heart of Azeroth<br />
<br />
Fixed an issue that caused Meticulous Scheming to trigger less frequently than intended.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Player versus Player<br />
<br />
Resolved an issue that prevented the intended 50% reduction to Azerite Traits in PvP from being applied to Traits found on Engineering helms.<br />
The effectiveness of Ward of Envelopment (https://www.wowdb.com/items/165569-ward-of-envelopment) and Mirror of Entwined Fate (https://www.wowdb.com/items/165578-mirror-of-entwined-fate) in PvP has been reduced by 50% for player characters who are not in a healing specialization.<br />
The effectiveness of Diamond-Laced Refracting Prism (https://www.wowdb.com/items/165573-diamond-laced-refracting-prism) in PvP has been reduced by 50% for player characters who are not in a tank specialization.<br />
<br />
Developers’ notes: The above trinkets are balanced for healers and tanks in PvP, and their current tuning slows down the pacing of Arena combat unacceptably when used by nonstandard roles. Reducing their effectiveness in PvP, for those roles only, will allow them to remain a formidable option.<br />
