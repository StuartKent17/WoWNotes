(http://www.heroesnexus.com/news/1590-greymane-out-hero-spotlight-what-hero-comes-next)<br />
<br />
Legion - Tyrande, Malfurion, and Elothir<br />
We found some interesting references to Tyrande, Malfurion, and Elothir. Unfortunately there isn't much more than what is below yet. Keep in mind that this is just a reference in an alpha build of Legion, not something final or officially announced. Spoilers below!<br />
<br />
The vision is chaotic, unfocused. I need to concentrate.<br />
I will need to focus on the vision to understand its message. Guard me while I do this, $n.<br />
Yes, Tyrande.<br />
Do not let anything disturb my meditation. I must see through the chaos.<br />
I see... swirling red mist. Gnashing teeth.<br />
That is Malfurion's voice! He is livid and... in terrible agony.<br />
Such malevolent laughter... who could be so cruel?<br />
I only pray that we are not too late.<br />
The corruption is getting worse. There is something across the bridge... Is that the Archdruid Elothir?<br />
By Elune... what happened, Elothir? Have you seen my husband?<br />
The Nightmare... claims me. Malfurion calls out in the darkness. I cannot see him...<br />
You must help me find him! Is there anything I can do?<br />
You may not, but perhaps... your mother moon can.<br />
I will petition Elune. The Nightmare taint cannot be removed.... but perhaps we can hold it back.<br />
Long enough... to seek him out... *Elothir groans* The trees whisper nonsense. I can almost understand...<br />
Hold yourself on the edge of madness, Elothir! Mother moon will hold you as long as she can.<br />
He approaches the heart of corruption! Quickly, Tyrande, to Shala'nir! There is no time!<br />
I will go to him! Elothir?<br />
The madness... claims me...<br />
Elothir's form is unresponsive. The Nightmare has taken hold.<br />
Elothir's inert form stares blankly into the distance.<br />
Elothir appears completely unaware of his surroundings.<br />
There is no time to lose. Elothir is beyond our reach now. Come with me.<br />
Shala'nir is just ahead. When we arrive, you will search the buildings to the left. I will search those to the right. Shout if you find him.<br />
I am coming Malfurion!<br />
I hear a struggle by the gazebo! Malfurion?! Answer me!<br />
Hah! Claim him if you can, Night Elf!<br />
<br />

Ghostcrawler Tweets<br />
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br />
Besides, how many people actually have &quot;the Insane&quot; in WoW? Pretty small percent, and that's pure dedication.<br />
That one is, but I'd argue the prestige is pretty small. Now imagine it granted a legendary.... (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/685657650869088256))<br />
<br />
Well, he also conceded that maybe it's not feasible.<br />
Yeah. I think there is an expectation that only a few people can wield say Excalibur, but maybe not in an MMO (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/685657938963218432))<br />

From my understanding of the order halls, you will have just a few champions you can send out to the world, but when they find something, you will have to go there to finish the quest. Also you will meet fellow class players in the halls. A much better concept than garrisons imo.</div></div><hr />

And that's basically it, no mines and herb gardens, no AH / transmog access, no profession buildings, no more farming bones for 15 minutes in Ashran to deck out your char in blue gear. Earning gold will probably be a lot more restrictive in order halls than in garrisons (This one is mainly speculation at this point). You'll have plenty more reason to leave the Class order hall compared to Garrisons. They said they wanted the order halls to be somewhere you'd visit once, maybe twice a day. Restricting normal activities in the hall to missions largely accomplishes that.</div></div><hr />

Take a look at the datamined info on Order Hall missions located here: http://legion.wowhead.com/missions=4. You will see that the rewards are actually just items that begin quests for you. Followers will only be acting as scouts in legion, funneling info to you so that you can go out into the world and take care of business.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, it's called Stormrage. In this novel, Malfurion and Thura kill Xavius. The events are canon (https://twitter.com/MickyNeilson/status/632316670023892992).</div></div><hr />

<br />
So i have to do a garrison mission to get a quest for myself? I didn't enjoy that with WoD garrisons and i find it just as dumb for Legion.<br />
<br />
Why do i need to send someone out to do a pre-quest so i can go do a quest? How about i just go do the whole thing at once instead?<br />

Except i'm pretty sure you have to go back to the Order Hall any time you want to move into a new quest zone and upgrade/modify your Artifact and don't forget that the mission you just sent your &quot;champion&quot;, yeah he finished and now you have to go back to pick up the quest they have for you. <br />
<br />
They may INTEND for us to spend less time there, but we won't. We'll be there a LOT.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not seeing the Order Hall as some sort of garrison like feature. Granted they will still have quest and dailies attached to them, there will be some mission, but it won't be through a slot machine interface, we won't have a garden and a mine, profession will not be part of the hall experience. Not sure how this is going to be anything like the garrison, maybe in very very small aspect, but not even close to the same. They sure, as hell are not going to be some sort of face book mini game. <br />
<br />
I think, you are ones of those that like to read more into things than is actually there. Hype of WoD went in the same manor, so many went completely over the top the other way in seeing more than was actually there and when many of them actually went through the content they were deflated at what they experienced. I new exactly what WoD was and what it was going to offer earlier on, but many just kept buying and selling the hype. You are trying do the reverse here by making more out of something that is not, which is par for the course on these boards.</div></div><hr />

Coupled with the fact that im sure they will make traveling to the Order Halls a pain in the ass(time sink/no order halls hearthstone).....most likely have to travel to Dalaran, than take a portal would be my guess.</div></div><hr />
