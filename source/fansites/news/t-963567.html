The amount of users and posts keeps increasing at a very fast pace and we reached the point where we need some help before the trolls take over and play Whack-a-Mod in the new Darkmoon Faire. I know it sounds fun, but I'm going to assume we don't want that. <br />

<br />
Read this if you plan to apply<br />
<br />
Please please please, do not apply if you're just super bored at the end of August before you go back to school/work. I'm not asking for a life-long commitment, but more than 2 weeks would be nice. <br />
Do not apply if you only want to wave your banhammer at random people. Moderators are expected to post on the forums they moderate regularly, contribute, keep the sticky posts clean and updated, etc ... <br />
You will be expected to be on IRC most of the time to communicate with the rest of the team. This is very important, and you're not getting promoted before you come and say hi. (We can tell you how that works, it's pretty easy)<br />
If you apply to moderate a class forum, you will be expected to know how your class works. <br />
<br />
<br />
I can do that! What do you need from me?<br />
<br />
You will need a certain level of activity on forums over the past x days to be eligible to apply on a forum. I'm not going to go into details, but it will make the selection process much easier on our side if we can easily spot who is active and who isn't. <br />
A reasonable amount of free time, but probably less than you think. If you're already an active poster (and if we don't screw up, you are) it will probably just 10 more minutes to your daily forum routine. <br />
Don't be stupid. Realistically, it will be easy to figure that out by going through your post history, but if you got infracted 5 times over the past month, you're probably out. <br />
<br />
<br />
How do I apply?<br />
<br />
Fill this very simple form (http://www.mmo-champion.com/modapply.php). <br />
Your application will be listed and admins will review it. It should be slightly faster than in the past, since most of the data we used to gather on applicants is now obtained automatically. (Yes, we're going to stalk your forum life)<br />
You will get a PM from our lovely Scrapbot if you're refused or accepted. If you're accepted, more instructions will follow, and cake. <br />
<br />
<br />
Important<br />
<br />
There is a 14 days waiting period before you can reapply after your application got rejected/accepted. <br />
One of the &quot;base&quot; requirements to be eligible to moderate a forum is to have 100 posts in the past 90 days in that forum. A little over 1 post/day for a moderator doesn't seem excessive, and is required to have credible moderators. <br />
The post limit might change in the future for some forums, the current limits are just a test and we'll see how things go. <br />
Do not apply to another forum just because you're not eligible for the one you wanted in the first place. That's dumb, especially since limits might change soon. (Within a week)<br />
It doesn't mean you'll get recruited on that, if we only see shitty posts in your history you're going to get refused so fast that it will feel like a saturday night with me. <br />
The moderator application process will always be active from now on, don't rush your application thinking it will be your only chance, we'll now recruit very regularly. <br />
Past infractions won't block you from applying or being a mod if they're small infractions. Obviously, if you did something incredibly stupid your chances to be a mod will be greatly lowered. <br />

Transmogrification Questions<br />
Q: If you have armor and weapons on you person that are no longer available in the game can you use those skins?<br />
A: Yes, you can -- assuming they fulfill the other criteria for eligibility.<br />
<br />
Q: If I have a weapon that equips on the hip and I mog it to one that equips on the back, will it continue to equip on the hip (like the original) or will it switch to the back (like the one I used to mog with)?<br />
A: The way a weapon sheathes is tied to its artwork, so the weapon will appear sheathed in whatever fashion the source item for Transmogrification did. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/191995/so-lets-talk-dress-up-part-2) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/3053678021?page=9#170))<br />
<br />
Q: Will Main Hand only weaponry be 'Mog&quot;ifiable to the offhand slot?<br />
A: Mainhand can only be applied to mainhand, and offhand can only be applied to offhand. This is partially due to the restrictions on certain types of weapon art.<br />
<br />
Again, these are our first tentative steps with Transmogrification, and there's room for modifying the rules later on after the system is introduced, and we see how things shake out. Heck, the rules aren't even quite set in stone right now, and might change further before the system is introduced. <br />
<br />
Q: If WoW was designed to not be &quot;silly&quot; why have the items in the game in the first place?<br />
A: World of Warcraft has a design aesthetic that limits silliness, not omits it utterly. We all like a laugh now and then. That's why we have so many fun novelty items, easter eggs and humorous quests. Still, with a handful of exceptions, there's been a pretty firm line drawn between what amounts to a novelty item (which we anticipate players showing off occasionally for a laugh, or to enjoy on a temporary basis), and items that we intend players to use in their day to day activities.<br />
<br />
It's that handful of exceptions that are the sticking point. It's the items like frying pans, cleavers and rolling pins that we're not sure we want players running around with on a constant basis. The jury is still out on that.<br />
<br />
I'm sure that there will be those that still find ways to make the most ridiculous outfits possible despite any precautions we take. We can't possibly anticipate every permutation of gear combinations that people will come up with, but we can strive to design the system so that there are fewer completely ridiculous looking characters running around. Yes, that's partially subjective. Yes, we also have a design aesthetic that, even with the introduction of the Transmogrifier, we still want to adhere to. No, I don't care if you personally think that any given tier set looks &quot;silly&quot;; that's not what's at issue. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/191485/so-lets-talk-dress-up) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/3053678021?page=9#170))<br />
<br />
Transmogrification of White and Grey Quality Items<br />
We're still discussing exactly what will or won't be available for transmogrification. So far, as others here have said, if it has stats and isn't a &quot;silly&quot; item such as a fish weapon, to my knowledge it will likely be available to transmogrify. However, as I said, nothing is finalized yet and things are subject to change before and after the feature has been released. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/192023/transmog-grey-and-white-armour-as-well) / Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/2569297684?page=2#27))<br />
<br />
So, about that button to disable transmogrification<br />
The Transmogrify feature will allow players to customize the look of their character within reason. We've already stated that it's likely certain items will not be available to transmogrify, including fish as weapons, and other items such as frying pans, for this very reason. As you know, armor types will also be locked, preventing tanks in cloth dresses for example.<br />
<br />
The rules will be tweaked as time goes on, but we're keen to keep the outlandish outfits to a minimum. What players wear while socialising in cities is up to them, exactly the same as now.

<br />
Turning transmog off could help alot in random bg's too, it would help me decide wether or not I should rush in and try to win 2v1 to cap a flag or if I can kill 2 attackers by myself, or wether or not I should waste my time trying to heal PvE geared morons that will just die in seconds anyway. I don't see why they would stop us from having the option to turn it off.<br />

Yes. We're not stupid; we can tell who spams pointless things for post count just because we announce recruitment.<br />

But the good news is that since the app will be up indefinitely, you can start participating more often and apply when you meet the requirements. :)</div></div><hr />

Thank you, that's what I was pretty sure of. I think any moderator applications will probably wait until around next summer, by which time I will probably have a good number of posts and a good amount of free time :)<br />
<br />
Edit: Also, another query, how can I track my posts in the Fun Stuff forum? That's the forum I post most in and what I would consider first for a moderator opportunity.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The pvp'ers that are crying about this are the ones that actively seek out lower geared players for easy kills instead of actually challenging themselves.<br />
<br />
yeh we all do it, if we see some PvE nabbins runnin around we kill on sight but who cares if we cant tell anymore makes pvp more interesting instead of watching wuss's leg it from people who actually have PVP gear, hey it might even mean some people will focus on killing healers now instead of trying to nuke little jimmy firelands.<br />
<br />
if your really desperate for easy kills because your too stupid to kill someone at the same gear level as you then look at their healthbars, if they have really low hp they are pve geared if they are at around 140k-150k hp they are pvp geared simples.<br />
most tanks are obvious they either have a shield are bear form or have bone armor. so if they are a tank and only 140k hp they are likely pve geared<br />
not sure if that pally is a tank or healer look at their mana if its around 100k hes a healer if its around 20-30k hes a tank.<br />

You can use the advanced search:<br />
<br />
http://www.mmo-champion.com/search.php?search_type=1<br />
<br />
Put your username, select 'fun stuff' (or whatever individual forum you'd like to check), 3 months and newer, Posts, then look at the results. You'll have to actually go through to find the last page of results to find the exact number, though; the initial &quot;Results 1 to X of 120&quot; only counts the first 5 pages of results.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You really have no idea what you're talking about, at all. There is a difference between actively seeking out scrubs and knowing what you're playing against.<br />
Also, why would anyone just stop to look at their HP ? it's not like it makes a difference, people in 358 blues and people in full epics have maybe 10k difference in HP wich can obviously change depending on buffs, so that isn't reliable. Like I said in my first post, I want to know just by looking at somebody wether or not I should waste my time and mana healing somebody, or if it possible to kill 1-2 people while defending or if I should call it out. But I guess you think stopping to look at your UI and see how much health somebody has or to inspect a team mate in the middle of a huge fight is the 1337 thing to do in PvP. Go back to staring at your UI for hours while you kill your scipted bosses.</div></div><hr />

Having character ideas stripped from us because of some people's selfish prejudices against how far originality can go. Indiana Jones raided many places in in his epic Leather Jacket, his trusty hat while wielding his trademark whip. Same thing with Lara croft with her tight outfits and her guns. All those characters had to be invented by someone, no? If they can do it, I see no reason why a gnome wearing bunny ears, a pink robe and an egg basket can't put a dent in Lord Rhyolith's Obsidian coat proven he is skilled. Very farfeteched, but not any less true.<br />
<br />
At the very very least give us the option to transmogrify in or out of legendaries. Most people will use legendary pieces of armor, aka tier sets anyway, they are just more options.</div></div><hr />

Sure some will love it and spend hours farming old content for gear (proved by people still farming BT for Warglaives of Azzinoth) but most don't care for looks, and some may see it as a downside (e.g. cant show off their full t13 set because the season 2 skin-wearer is getting all the attention etc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The pvp'ers that are crying about this are the ones that actively seek out lower geared players for easy kills instead of actually challenging themselves.<br />
<br />
yeh we all do it, if we see some PvE nabbins runnin around we kill on sight but who cares if we cant tell anymore makes pvp more interesting instead of watching wuss's leg it from people who actually have PVP gear, hey it might even mean some people will focus on killing healers now instead of trying to nuke little jimmy firelands.<br />
<br />
if your really desperate for easy kills because your too stupid to kill someone at the same gear level as you then look at their healthbars, if they have really low hp they are pve geared if they are at around 140k-150k hp they are pvp geared simples.<br />
Going to go out on a limb here and guess that your PVP experience is even more limited than mine. As of Cata you cannot estimate how much PVE gear someone is wearing from max health (in fact, current-tier heroic PVE gear has /more/ Stamina than current-season PVP gear). If they have low health they are undergeared, whether PVE or PVP. PVPers are unhappy because the skill cap includes recognizing what your opponents are wearing. In a lot of comps there is a correct choice of target to tunnel, and in those comps the other players are now free to swap in PVE gear in any slot because the resilience would be less useful against smart teams. Currently it is not feasible to use 4T12 in PVP because you can't hide the fact that you (un)do more damage and take more damage.<br />
<br />
The simple solution is to disable changing any item with resilience, or copying from any item with resilience. If they want to allow PVPers to rock some old sets they could allow PVE&lt;-&gt;PVE and PVP&lt;-&gt;PVP, but not PVE&lt;-&gt;PVP, although that would be a lot more work to implement. Another simple solution would be to disable all active transmogs in BGs and Arenas, or at the very least all rated PVP.</div></div><hr />

Just come to terms with the fact that you will have to work harder and be more strategic, or else the ironic criticism of PvE'ers having it easy will fall on deaf gears given that you'd still be (as always), homing in on the lower-geared targets. If anything, PvE'ers are already oe step ahead; the volcanoes on hc Ragnaros proc on RNG, and therefore can't be anticipated but still must be dealt with, yet PvP'ers (for now, relish it while it lasts) are still able to get an approximation of how easy/hard someone will be to kill by looking at their gear, and thusly act on it with the very &quot;skilled&quot; 3+ vs 1 as is so often seen.</div></div><hr />

This transmogrify feature seems really boring... I don´t have time to play 24/7 so I play on raid nights and some occassional arena.. I don´t have time to farm gear as well, especially for crap I have already owned before. It´s no fun not being able to use other classes armors or different armor types, wich would let everyone create really fun and unique sets... And they won´t even implement inks for armors. I wish they would spend time working on the actual problems this game has and creating great raids like Ulduar. Instead we get a pile of troll manure expansion, TOC v2 (FL), bug fixes and class balance are in the toilet and a bunch of useless crap. This game is going down the shitter at ever increasing speed.<br />
<br />
Old sets are easily farmable, since it's old content. Also, you can only try it once per week if they're from raids. No problem, it's as casual as something can be before they just mail everything to you.<br />
<br />
And with all this crap features/patch, they at least did something right in not allowing other classes armors and inks. No reason for you to wear a priest tier on your DK. Also no reason to let ppl ruin stuff allowing them to color it with whatever comes to their minds. Other games allowed it, other games suffered.<br />
<br />
No reason to make something stupid, more stupid.<br />
<br />

<br />
You really have no idea what you're talking about, at all. There is a difference between actively seeking out scrubs and knowing what you're playing against.<br />
Also, why would anyone just stop to look at their HP ? it's not like it makes a difference, people in 358 blues and people in full epics have maybe 10k difference in HP wich can obviously change depending on buffs, so that isn't reliable. Like I said in my first post, I want to know just by looking at somebody wether or not I should waste my time and mana healing somebody, or if it possible to kill 1-2 people while defending or if I should call it out. But I guess you think stopping to look at your UI and see how much health somebody has or to inspect a team mate in the middle of a huge fight is the 1337 thing to do in PvP. Go back to staring at your UI for hours while you kill your scipted bosses.<br />
<br />
Yeah... because pvp is so not scripted... all the actions are the same, all the focus player X or Y are not the same, all the addons telling you what to do, what to interrupt, etc. are not the same...<br />
<br />
I can just go and try to deal with a tank and not their healer, because pvp isn't like scripted like pve... lol<br />
<br />
The only pvp that is not scripted is noob pvp where ppl do random things, use the wrong skills at the wrong time, etc. All the actions in a decent pvp fight is just following the &quot;what should I do against...&quot; &quot;rule book&quot;. The only thing diferent between pvp and pve (other than gear/stats you need) is that you will never get a chance to get a &quot;Donald&quot; playing the raid boss (so, a noob) while on pvp that feared mage class coming at you can just be a noob trying to &quot;pivipi&quot; or a guy that knows what he is doing.<br />
<br />
And not checking your oponent's health? Never? Really? Tunnel vision ftw... something even a nameplate (with addons to put it the way they look best for you) can do to keep your tunnel vision going...<br />
<br />
To think that most &quot;skilled players&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;pivipi&quot;) fail so hard at &quot;scripted bosses&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Are you serious? There is things you have to do against certain comps or classes, but that doesn't change the fact they can easily avoid or change what you have to do, there is no script. You must be a terrible player if you think there is a set way to do things. You need an addon to tell you to interupt? LOL. Also, why don't you atleast learn to play before replying, you don't even realise that there is no difference between PvE and PvP HP, unless ofcourse somebody is a tank. There is also very little difference between the 358 blues and full epic gear, because of buffs, looking at a persons HP tells you nothing, if you don't even know that, you shouldn't be telling people to &quot;look at their HP to see how good their gear is... DERP&quot;<br />
<br />
The sad thing is, it's the only thing you kids can say against having an option to turn it off, it's pathetic. You should just admit that some people have lifes and don't care if you managed to waste part of yours farming old gear. You just want to force people to look at the crap you're wearing so you can feel special for once in your life.</div></div><hr />

It's not going to happen. What a player decides to wear its up to him not you, where is the problem with that? <br />
As for PvP, well it's finally getting to a point where it might actually become interesting. If I might bring real life into this discussion; Sometimes your enemy also disguises as civilians and you have to handle that too, it's not always uniforms vs. uniforms, combat is a dirty game. If anything I think, transmogrification might make PvP more interesting just because of the fact you wont exactly know what the players your facing gear is.</div></div><hr />

Ofcorse they shouldn't have the option to not see it. That foolish<br />
<br />
&quot;The gear now looks this way, but I dont want to see it that way, wahhhh&quot;<br />
<br />
That is just a self absorbed sense of entitlement, and no it is NOT a legitimate argument.<br />
<br />
Fear of chage is something that stifles growth ruins progress in the industry. Wasting development time on an &quot;opt out&quot; function is useless. <br />
If they begin developing opt out for one thing, the vocal whiney minority will cry for it for every feature implemented into the game. Getting new and better gear ? wahhh i want to opt out but still feel entitled to have good stats.<br />
<br />
Maybe I want an option that makes it so you can't see my gear at all ? It's MY gear, YOU shouldn't be able to see it if I don't want you too !<br />
Maybe I'm ENTITLED to have my own gear be private, I earned it, it's mine, You should have no right to see personal things about my character.<br />
<br />
Sound foolish ? of corse it does, it IS foolish<br />
<br />
Just like the percieved right of some people to be able to opt out of seeign what gear you want to be seen.<br />

<br />
&quot;The gear now looks this way, but I dont want to see it that way, wahhhh&quot;<br />
<br />
That is just a self absorbed sense of entitlement, and no it is NOT a legitimate argument.<br />
<br />
Fear of chage is something that stifles growth ruins progress in the industry. Wasting development time on an &quot;opt out&quot; function is useless. <br />
If they begin developing opt out for one thing, the vocal whiney minority will cry for it for every feature implemented into the game. Getting new and better gear ? wahhh i want to opt out but still feel entitled to have good stats.<br />
<br />
Maybe I want an option that makes it so you can't see my gear at all ? It's MY gear, YOU shouldn't be able to see it if I don't want you too !<br />
Maybe I'm ENTITLED to have my own gear be private, I earned it, it's mine, You should have no right to see personal things about my character.<br />
<br />
Sound foolish ? of corse it does, it IS foolish<br />
<br />
Just like the percieved right of some people to be able to opt out of seeign what gear you want to be seen.<br />
<br />
It's foolish.<br />
<br />
Cool, another idiot that can't read. There is no false sense on entitlement, it's simply a fact that there should be an option to see original gear or the transmogged gear. Don't even bother to start talking about spending time developing things, you clearly have no idea about games development, otherwise you would realise that it would literally take one person 5 minutes to implement it. Really? &quot;Maybe I want an option that makes it so you can't see my gear at all&quot; Are you honestly that stupid? There is a huge difference between asking to see original gear for legitimate purposes and asking for an option to turn all gear off, I can't even explain just how idiotic that post is.</div></div><hr />

It shouldn't; try clearing your cookies or going there in a new browser tab/window.<br />

So I guess my bunch of infractions and two forum bans rules me out? :( <br />

It won't prevent you from applying; whether they keep us from accepting depends when they were and how severe. There's no hard rule against past infractions, but we're also probably not going to accept someone who's just a huge troll constantly.<br />

here's my question then, what would you want me to do in order to be considered ? :) ( as in where/who should i post/pm)<br />

I can read, I simply whole heartedly do not agree with you. There should not be an option to see non transmogrified gear. Any arguments for optiong out have been flimsy at best, mostly a slew of peope what like to kill the poorly geared. <br />
<br />
Yes, this is all about entitlement, no use arguing otherwise. It's an argument of, it has been this way, I'm used to it, I pay you, give me what I want.<br />
<br />
I am infact, quite farmiliar with game development. Saying something &quot;will literally take one person 5 minutes&quot; however only shows your own complete ignorance to how development actually works and that you have no grasp of the reality associated with the business.<br />

We have not been able to see most druid gear since release. We have not been able to tell if a feral druid is wearing PvE gear PvP gear or a tutu...this simply causes this effect on other classes. I have never been able to have the option to see what a druid is wearing in pvp.<br />
<br />
Not a big deal.</div></div><hr />

The reason why, is full sets. Not all classes were designed where you can equip just one or two things and make it look like it even almost belongs together. My questions are: Are enchants tied to current weapons art, if so will enchants show at all? Do I need two of the same weapon to have one in each hand?<br />

Hardcore PvP players may hate this, but I doubt that Blizz is doing anything at all for those specific players. Anyway, if you think that's bad, think about where you could change out more than one set. Is that an option? Can i have 2 that are tied to two other looks? lol Blizz should have went with color change only, and left it at that imho. Will be fun none the less, if they actually complete all the hurdles it will require.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Every reply to my post so far has made me facepalm, hard.<br />
<br />
Oh but it does. If i go change my priests t12 to look like t6, I want you to see me in t6 not in t12, how hard is it to understand that. If there is an option for you to see me as t12 whilst transmogrified in t6, that makes no sense what so ever. It's the charm of the feature really to pick outfits you want others to see you in, else I can just go modify game files and look like t6 only for myself but that's just crap.<br />
<br />
We finally get the option to modify out looks a bit more extensively. It's my character, my 13EUR/month, so if you see me, you better see what I want you to see, not what you want to see - it is that simple. <br />
<br />
You don't go round your city and demand people to change clothes just because you want to see them in different ones do you?<br />
<br />
You can also still see real gear by inspecting or looking it up on the armory if that bothers you that much, I don't see a problem here really. It's just a problem with general gankers that they wouldn't be able to distinguish between and easy kill and a hard kill. And I too share the fear that there will be stupid outfits in the end like pink skirt tanking taurens and similar stuff, but I still have hope that Blizzard will be monitoring items and transmogrification closely and ban certain problematic items as soon as they appear.</div></div><hr />

Unless they hop out of form there is no way for you to tell how well geared they are from looking at their character. This helps to level that playing field by stopping you judging any character by their appearance and forces you into thinking more about the class / spec (e.g. frost mages have an elemental beside them).</div></div><hr />

That shows my ignorance to games development? It's funny then how I am a games developer and I have worked on many AAA titles, so I think I know what i am talking about, unlike you, you're just another one of those kids that goes round the internet talking like they know what they are talking about. You think a simple check box that turns off transmog would take more than 5mins to code? HAHA. Every single peice of transmogged gear will need to send a specific packet of information to the world server, to tell it that the art id has now changed, from then on it will send that same ID to every other persons client around the person with the transmogged gear, otherwise we couldn't see the change, they could just see that you want it turned off and send the original ID, takes 5 mins to code that, or they could make your client reset the ID has you recive it, again taking 5 mins to code.<br />
<br />
You say arguments for a option to turn it off are flimsy at best? My argument is that in random bg's I want to know who is worth healing and who isn't, some kid in bad PvE gear isn't worth my time or mana. I want to know if I can defend a flag against 2-3 people by myself or if I should call it out, if I can see their bad gear, I know I can, that way i don't need to get others who are defending other flags to come and help me. And I may just not like the older gear, maybe I just want to see the new gear because it looks better to me.

<br />
Not at all, it has a lot of restrictions. So if you want plate to look like mail; That's not happening whatsoever <br />
<br />
So if you want Plate to look like cloth, you are unable to do so in addition the thing you are trying to ''trans'' must also have stats to be valid as well <br />
<br />
Anything else is similar like Mail to cloth - Leather to Plate</div></div><hr />

You will have to adapt and your argument is the exact opposite of ours, you want us to see in non-mogged gear just so because you want it easy, OK I want you to see me in mogged gear so you wont have it easy, reason enough for you? Your post are also self centered a lot, what you want and what you can get are two different things, just because you might not like something, someone else might adore it, it's a MMO after all. <br />
<br />
Thousand people - Thousand different tastes <br />
<br />
So far the only one complaining are ignorant PvPers who as I wrote above are looking for easy kills, well now they will have to adapt to this feature and live with it or quit the game, besides there's tons of vanity trinkets that change the visuals of characters why don't you go on a crusade against those?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
If you are healing in a BG and you have two DPS with you who are both in PvE gear, are you not going to heal them? What do you think is going to happen? The opposing faction will kill them and you. Why not take the opportunity to highlight your awesome healing abilities by keeping two players with subpar gear alive against much better geared opponents?<br />
<br />
The bottom line is that I will be mogging my chars into appearances that I want other people to see. I also gave my characters certain appearances and I named them certain names for other people to see. I don't want my character to look a certain way just to me. I want my character to look that way to the whole of Azeroth. This is a role-playing game after all.<br />
<br />
No shit, have you never heard of exaggeration? Although at most it could 1-2 hours to make, it wouldn't me a big thing, it would be very simple. And actually I am a 3D artist, I mainly do modeling and texturing work. I am also pretty good with animation, but I only do that when I am really needed to.<br />
<br />
I don't know how many times I have to explain this before somebody with an IQ over 80 comes along and understands it, but again, transmog is there so you can look how YOU want. Wanting other people too see the gear you managed to 5 shot an old boss for is not what the transmog is there for. And no, this game is not a role playing game, AT ALL. Infact, RP is for sad little people who have no life and live in a basement, so they pretend to be some orc or space cow in a video game. That is the reason most people don't do it or care about it, wich means this game certainly isn't about RP. Not to mention the fact that it is an OPTION, therefore if you insist on pretending to be some person in a video game, the other people there can keep transmogg turned on, that is the whole point.<br />
<br />
Still no valid reason to not have an option to turn it off.</div></div><hr />

Exactly, by that line of thinking one could say, the game is not PvP, it's PvE. The argument is moot. Players will have the same opportunities as other players. Other good players will be dealing with the exact same things, in mostly the same ways.</div></div><hr />
