Battle of Dazar’alor<br />
<br />
Stormwall Blockade<br />
<br />
The interval between spawns of Energized Storms has been reduced by 25% on all non-Mythic difficulties.<br />
Developers’ notes: This reverts one of the changes made yesterday. In combination with the health reduction to Laminaria and the Energized Storm, this additional change excessively reduced the difficulty of what was meant to be a challenging encounter deep in Battle of Dazar’alor, so we’re rolling it back. All other changes from yesterday remain.<br />

Items<br />
<br />
Heart of Azeroth<br />
<br />
Fixed a bug that caused Bonded Souls to target pets. It will now only select the nearest friendly player while it is active.<br />
Monk<br />
<br />
Fury of Xuen can now stack up to 100 times (was 67).<br />
Developers’ notes: In a hotfix made yesterday, the per-stack percentage went from 1.5 to 1%. We want the total chance to still be able to stack up to 100%.<br />

World<br />
<br />
Sylvanas has dispatched additional Horde guard support near the Banshee's Wail and Warfront staging areas of the Port of Zandalar. The scamps with scrolls that were previously found in the Warfront area have been relocated to other parts of the Grand Bazaar.<br />
Fixed a bug at some Guard Posts that caused NPC guards to ignore nearby players who need killin’.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i ohnestly think this is the best of all the hotixes,<br />
<br />
like come on a raid group of 30 storming your docks, and 3-4 guards just dont even attack them, even when your mowed down in front of them.<br />
<br />
the issue was not that the guards werent there,<br />
its that they were treating hostile targets as neutrals.<br />
<br />
might have something to do with people being Exalted with Zandalari from Vanilla?</div></div><hr />

I wouldn't call the 8th boss in a 9 boss raid an early roadblock though. :P</div></div><hr />

think he means this early into a raid tier (77 days, more or less), not that early into a raid lockout</div></div><hr />

<br />
That doesn't even make any sense. Its the second to last boss in the tier, thats never &quot;early&quot;, entirely independent of how fast anyone progresses to it.</div></div><hr />

The issue was that most of the guards weren't really there. They were just phased window dressing to make the place seem more alive. Most of them are orcs and undead anyway at the docks, so rep wouldn't have anything to do with it. At least it's being addressed.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zequill</div><div class="date">2019-01-31, 06:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">One of the issue with Stormwall Blockade is that when you kill an adds, it reapply the debuff to spawn it to a random people. If you kill the adds before it reach the boss, you are just wasting your dps. You need to keep some dps (melee are perfect there) on the boss at all time except if an adds is casting on boss. If not, you will be overwhelmed when the boss cast a new debuff, making 2 adds spawn at the same time (look like at least 2 minutes in phase 2)</div></div><hr />

maybe thats something to do with Alliance being on the defensive? as horde started the war....<br />
<br />
i mean god damn, you just sacked our entire city, and killed its king.<br />
<br />
and you dont think they would increase security....</div></div><hr />

/r/competitivewow considers normal Blockade to be harder than mythic Champion of the Light.<br />
<br />
Seems like a little much.</div></div><hr />

Game mechanics &gt; lore.</div></div><hr />

<br />
but as i was saying, yes they put more guards there cause at any given time we had 40+ alliance camping the docks, <br />
<br />
but on a lore side, Alliance killed their king, Sylvannas wants to show the Zandalari her support. isnt that a good way by throwing More Soldiers into the Capital to defend it,<br />
<br />
not like the undead have a capital to defend anymore..... Lol</div></div><hr />
