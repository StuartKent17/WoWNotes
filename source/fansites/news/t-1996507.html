<br />
Legion - Respect Cost Removed<br />
The costs to change specs and talents are changing in the next Legion build:<br />
<br />
<br />
Changing specs in Legion will no longer cost gold! <br />
Changing talents will be free in a city or your Order Hall.<br />
Changing talents out in the field will require a reagent crafted by Inscription with a cost aimed at groups. <br />
Currently, talent changes are free and instant out of combat, which isn't restrictive enough. <br />
In the current build the system that is going away worked like this:<br />
<br />
You could change from any spec to your primary spec for free, with your primary spec set at a class trainer.<br />
Your first respec was free, with a cooldown of less than 24 hours to reset the cost to free again. <br />
After that, respecs were &lt;span class=&quot;money-gold&quot; alt=&quot;g&quot;&gt;19&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;money-gold&quot; alt=&quot;g&quot;&gt;39&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;money-gold&quot; alt=&quot;g&quot;&gt;58&lt;/span&gt;, and capping at &lt;span class=&quot;money-gold&quot; alt=&quot;g&quot;&gt;78&lt;/span&gt;, with a 24 hour cooldown to drop one cost level each time you changed specs. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
We've definitely heard much feedback to this effect, and this is something we'd been discussing quite a bit internally as well over the past couple of weeks. In an upcoming build (hopefully the next one; if not, then the one after), the respec cost is gone, and players can freely switch between all specializations with the normal restrictions of cast-time, needing to be out of combat, and so forth.<br />
<br />
Ultimately, the intent behind the respec cost (which isn't really a new concept, dating back to 2004 class trainers) was to help reinforce a bit of spec identity through declaring a &quot;primary&quot; spec to which you could always return for free, and to serve as a mild gold sink. But in practice, changing specialization is a pretty significant transformation in terms of action bars, optimal gear in some cases, artifacts, and so forth, and already not something that people were taking lightly. I suspect the cost will not be missed.<br />
<br />
An area that has appeared to need a bit more friction, however, is actually talent changes. Especially with no reagent cost at all now, it can be all too easy to activate AoE talents before larger packs of enemies in a dungeon, and then switch back to single-target talents before a lieutenant or a boss. Or someone might switch to a passive movement-speed talent when traversing an area, and then back to something functional before entering combat. At that point, we're often hardly talking about a meaningful choice at all, but rather a nuisance of extra button-presses or UI navigation before you can use your desired talents.<br />
<br />
And so, alongside removing the respec cost, that same upcoming build will also restrict the ability to change talents when away from a safe area (defined as an area that provides the Rested state). We currently plan to give Scribes a recipe to craft a consumable Tome that can be dropped in order to allow all nearby players to retalent freely for a time - particularly useful for group play.<br />
<br />
A couple of clarifications, one of which will probably be a relief and the other likely less so: The Inscription consumable as currently planned would be something that anyone could drop, not a profession-requiring item like a Jeeves. But, in terms of the materials required, we're thinking of something that's more aimed at groups, and probably not the sort of thing an individual is likely to carry a stack of and use freely.<br />
<br />
This is clearly more restrictive than the way it works in Warlords. Why would we ever add restrictions to something like this? Do we just sit around and amuse ourselves by thinking of things to take away from players? (We don't.)<br />
<br />
Ultimately, for a choice to be meaningful there has to be some associated cost or trade-off in the process. Do you want to eat your cake, or do you want to save it for another time? If you could do both, that wouldn't be much of a choice. <br />
<br />
When it comes to talents, which serve the primary purpose of customization and differentiation, consider two extremes in terms of how they could be handled. Please, take a moment to think through the following scenarios:<br />
<br />
First, what if you could switch talents freely, at any time, including while in combat? You'd effectively no longer have a talent system - you'd have a spellbook with another 21 active and passive abilities in it, with keybinds to swap between them as needed. Every player of a given spec would have identical capabilities, with some cumbersome interface management required to swap among them on the fly.<br />
<br />
Second, what if you could literally never switch talents, short of making a brand new character? Choosing a talent would be a far, far weightier choice than any decision you currently make in the game (other than choosing your starting class, I suppose). Some favored cookie-cutter specs would emerge, but with 2187 different permutations of talents, there'd be significantly more variety among players. But some niche talents would likely go almost entirely unused (though players who did choose them would be invaluable when those situations arose). And feeling like you'd made a mistake, and were stuck with one or more talents that you didn't like at all, might completely sour your enjoyment of a character.<br />
<br />
Anyway, we are of course doing neither of those things, but there's a full spectrum of choice that lies in between. We've generally moved away from the second scenario and closer to the first over time (years and years back, respecs were so expensive in relative terms that players often waited for class changes to automatically refund their talents rather than spend the gold to move a point around). Other than the combat restrictions, the live game is not terribly far off from the first scenario. <br />
<br />
There's still a fair bit of thought that goes into which talents to select for a raid encounter, where you're in combat for several minutes in a row and facing a variety of threats, and you may have to weigh whether you want better AoE damage for minions in the first phase, or better single-target burst later in the fight; whether you want a passive movement-speed increase for higher overall uptime, or an on-demand active movement ability in case you get targeted by a specific troublesome ability; and so forth. <br />
<br />
But most other content, whether it's a single quest boss out in the world, or a dungeon that breaks down to a series of sub-1-minute combats, don't offer nearly that much variety. And so you take the AoE talent for the AoE pack, and the single-target talent for the lone boss, to the point that you might as well just have both of them all the time, which might be powerful, but wouldn't be a choice.<br />
<br />
I am actually relieved to hear that a scribe is not a necessity. But what I would like to know is if PvP is being kept in mind. For example, I might throw on my PvP gear to do a battleground. Let's say that takes me 15 minutes. After that, I'm being called to a raid. I need to change out my talents - twice because as we all know, there are certain talents that are better for PvP and certain talents that are better for PvE. I'm not really going to use spring blossoms in PvP due to movement but I might in PvE depending on the encounter. <br />
In this case, if you're returning to any safe area (your Class Order Hall, Dalaran, Stormwind, or whatever) in between activities, you could change talents freely with no cooldown, cost, or other restriction. The Inscription consumable would only come into play if you wanted to change talent out on the fly, in the field.<br />

Blue Posts<br />
Character Skin Color Options<br />
I've had plenty of friends who would like a more diverse style of skin choices for many races, humans included. I don't see this as far-fetched feedback by any means. <br />
<br />
One of the earliest ideas in RPGs was to create a character modeled after yourself in a fantasy world, where you can go on these spectacular adventures that aren't possible in the real world - the current choices can be limiting in this sense in various situations. Many people who are asking for these additions, among others, simply want a more customizable experience, and there is no harm in that.<br />
<br />
Anyways, I've passed this feedback along to the Development team. Let's keep the conversation civil and we will keep this thread open for more feedback and discussion!

Legion Beta Server Issues<br />
Dalaran Underbelly Disabled<br />
In order to address issues with Dalaran NPCs suddenly disappearing, we've decided to disable the Underbelly subzone for the time being. Players with characters saved in that zone will be ported out upon initial login. We're currently investigating permanent solutions to dissapearing NPCs and should have the issue resolved in an upcoming patch.<br />
<br />
Due to this change, Subtlety Rogue artifact acquisition questlines will be roadblocked for now. If you experience any other roadblocked questlines with this change, please let us know in your comments below. <br />
<br />
Thanks for your patience everyone! (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/412062-dalaran-underbelly-disabled/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/20743526335?page=1#1))<br />
<br />
World Server Down<br />
We are working on fixing this right now. Server team is doing battle with an issue impacting Dalaran which is causing it to crash, reboot, crash. Hoping to fix it soon™<br />
<br />
Our success in fixing some of the underlying phasing issues seems to uncovered this bug that was previously hidden. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/412092-world-server-down/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/20743934189?page=1#17))<br />
<br />
Server Lag<br />
Yes, we are attempting to slay these lag inducing bugs now as well.<br />
<br />
Had a quick question if you don't mind Yad, after I finished my Helheim quests on my DH and we got beamed up I dc'ed and cant log back in at all just to that one char. I managed to log in once and my screen is white and it says I'm stunned cant do anything and it dc'ed again. Was wondering if that's happening to everyone or any chance I can get a teleport for my char Laeroth. Thank you!<br />
Happening to many right now. Something else we are working on... It has been a busy day, hehe. <br />
<br />
TLDR there are many issues affecting servers which are being fixed right now in parallel. As a result we are frequently restarting servers to pickup changes. Some of these changes are leading to new or previously unknown issues that we then have to fix. Currently playing whack-a-bug. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/412074-is-the-server-laggy-or-is-it-me/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/20743854181?page=1#6))<br />
<br />
Phasing Issues<br />
We've had team members looking at the underlying causes of the phasing issues over the weekend and today. The good news is that as we've been digging in to find the root of the problem we've fixed dozens of issues in the system. While we're not confident that we've fixed the root cause once and for all yet we've seen this issue improving throughout the day on the Beta realms from some of the changes we've been making.<br />
<br />
We are still on this and it is a very high priority for us and this experience with the launch of Beta has been extremely valuable to us not only for exposing this issue but also the myriad of other load driven problems that have been uncovered thanks to the high volume of players.<br />
<br />
We hope to have this resolved soon so people can get back to testing out the content itself rather than being gated by disconnects and phase issues. We've been actively applying fixes for both to the server and clients throughout the day.

<br />
I'd say changing talents needs some sort of cooldown (30 minutes, charges, 1 minute grace period if you make the wrong switch) while in a dungeon or raid, but it'd need to reset when you reach a boss. Adapting to boss fights is fine I believe, but not feeling like you have to jump constantly between an AoE and ST talent in a Mythic+ dungeon because it happens to alternate between AoE:able trash and big champions or cleave situations. Make a call whether ST or AoE will benefit you the most throughout the run.<br />
<br />
So perhaps, you're free to switch talents when you enter a dungeon or raid, then you're on a cooldown and in an hour you can change talents twice (2 charges a 30min), resets when entering a boss room area.<br />
<br />
Works for shorter runs, and shouldn't be too cumbersone in 2-3 hour raid nights either. Make your choices from the content ahead and try to anticipate what you need during the time talent switch is on CD.</div></div><hr />

As pointed out when things are that easy to switch it no longer becomes a meaningful choice. With the talent switch cost removed I imagine you could set up an aoe and a single target spec, should you so wish.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mmoc7a6bdbfc72</div><div class="date">2016-05-17, 07:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh dear, they make changing specs - which most people do infrequently - easier and free, but changing talents, which most people do frequently particularly in raids, more difficult and expensive<br />
<br />
The talent tiers - at least for warlocks - are clearly designed to compel talent changes to be far more frequent, because they are more situationally mutually exclusive than ever before.<br />
<br />
Many of them are clearly designed to be &quot;you can have an AOE talent, or single target..but not both&quot;. The warlock tier talents for mobility or survivability are mutually exclusive, and almost all the single target/aoe enhancing ones are.<br />
<br />
It's not good for overall gameplay at all when adapting to different situational requirements becomes frustrating and annoying. Trust me, they aren't going to design raids with less variety between bosses just to save people switching talents. Quite the opposite<br />
<br />
<br />
This absolutely reeks of the usual cheap trick tactics of associating mat costs with frequent necessities simply to keep people grinding day in day out at the same content just to farm the mats. Or the gold to pay for the reagents<br />
<br />
Exactly the same reasons you have flasks and potions. Particularly potions. <br />
<br />
So now you will need a &quot;potion&quot; to change talents. <br />
<br />
It will be particularly mendacious if there happen to be any classes who don't have their AOE and ST talents in mutually exclusive positions.<br />
<br />
Congrats to Blizz on a truly awful idea.<br />
<br />
I read the announce and my heart sank. <br />
<br />
&quot;An area that has appeared to need a bit more friction, however, is actually talent changes.

&quot;<br />
<br />
Can anyone tell me why being able to adapt to situations as required in a simple and easy way is bad? Wow, how awful, a player who needs to do AOE can activate AOE talents. Let's make that process annoying and frustrating.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I'd guess that outside of progression raiding, most players will simply pick a compromise talent choice and pick a ST talent here, an AOE target there, and accept a &quot;jack of all trades, master of none&quot; approach rather that tit about with having to carry bagfulls of reagents or grind away earning gold to pay for them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Maybe you should read the posts you are responding to, it was explained in full detail why being able to switch all the time basically made the entire system pointless and you might as well give players everything at once. Its not to remove &quot;fun&quot;, its to make decisions matter. Respeccing talents every 30 seconds (trash -&gt; boss -&gt; trash -&gt; boss) is not something I would consider fun myself, but some people are weird about what they like, I suppose.</div></div><hr />

The philosophy also makes me wonder. A spec is supposed to be a significant choice. Making that free is odd. Talents are more finetuning for a spec. With the proposed changes spec identity, one of the pillars of Legion considering the Artifacts, will take a major hit for the pure dps classes. <br />
<br />
Honestly I'd rather have it reversed: respecs costing a group token and talents free with current restrictions.<br />
<br />
As a raider I just see it as a gold sink either way. You have to optimize for fights anyway so whatever form it takes to change, it will happen for every boss. As a pure dps I can optimize my 3 specs for different scenarios. Switching specs is enough to optimize, the whole point they're seemingly trying to prevent. This restriction will just be a slight frustration for hybrid dps, healers and tanks who are limited to optimization through their talents.</div></div><hr />

I'm sorry, but as a guy who likes to both DPS and heal (And I'm sure everyone else out there who has a Warrior, Death Knight, Paladin, Druid, Shaman, Monk or Priest) we change specs more than talents. Making a gold cost would make me think twice about offering to change rolls in a raid, as I'm sure a vast many would have as well.<br />
<br />
Changing talents on a fight-by-fight basis for min-maxing might be desired, but it's not as big a changer as having to wait an extra half-hour to find a healer because the guy who already changed from heals to DPS doesn't want to have to change back for an hour before 'Bob' comes back. If you have to, either buy the inscription item or just get a summon (Warlock/Summon stone) once you hearth/portal out and change.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Switching specs will be far less effective if you have to level up 3 artifact weapons first. Staying in your current spec and changing a talent to go from ST -&gt; AoE or something is a far easier move, even if you only deliver 99% instead of the potential 100% - assuming you had the Artifact on the same level, which you might not.<br />
<br />
Back in the &quot;good old days&quot; you had to go see a trainer to respec. I thought people liked that time. ;)<br />
Going to a major city or using a item doesn't seem impossible, we'll have to see how much these items cost. They could always re-tune the item to be cheap enough to not be too punishing, but still retain a feeling of meaningful decision, and not respeccing between trash and boss etc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because it's even less fun to face a &quot;meaningful decision&quot; which amounts to accepting being crap at some situations and/or carrying a bagful of reagents you have to grind the mats or gold for.<br />
<br />
The result will be people will use a talent calculator and stay with a &quot;best all round spec&quot; permanently, or they will accept that maximum performance just means an extra layer of boredom grinding and humping around a bag full of reagents into raids.<br />
<br />
I think it's a truly awful idea. And it runs entirely contrary to the years of crap we've had from Blizz about how talents shouldn't be mandatory blah blah blah<br />
<br />
This is little different to the sheer tedium warlocks used to have of farming bags full of soulshards before every raid as their abilities burnt them<br />
<br />
Either that or pre-raid you will tell your DPS/healers to have a split between them so that half concentrate on say AOE to burn the trash down (then the other half can feel bad during that), whilst the ones that concentrate on ST can make the AOE'ers feel bad on mini-bosses<br />
<br />
I must say I had my suspiscions aroused when I saw the talent trees, they are clearly designed to make people want to change talents more often than they do now.<br />
<br />
And here we go - attach a grinding requirement to do that. &quot;It keeps world content meaningful&quot; as the Blizz jargon goes.</div></div><hr />

You're talking about changing your primary spec. I haven't seen the problem you describe since we got dual-spec, because a (say) a warrior can have a tank and DPS spec and freely switch between them<br />
<br />
They only needed to visit a trainer if they wanted to change the primary spec to a different one. Since we have dual spec characters, once you chose your two hardly anyone ever did that since most did not want three.<br />
<br />
Like I said, they are making something most people don't do at all, or only very rarely, easier and cheaper, whilst making something most people want and need to do very often more annoying and expensive<br />
<br />
And it is all about increasing the grinding requirements.<br />

Precisely, the new talents tiers are very obviously designed to make it much more necessary to switch talents, and more of them, more often.<br />
<br />
Just looking at me (affliction lock) I can see how the new talent trees would mean a lot more switching in raids than the current one. The AOE and ST enhancers are all mutually exclusive. As are the movement-survivability ones now that they took away teleport/burning rush/damage shield ones from baseline and made them talents. And so on.</div></div><hr />

Maybe instead of making it so restricted (going to a safe zone or needing expensive reagents), they could add a cooldown per tier long enough to stop people abusing it in the way they described, and short enough to not be too much of a nuisance.</div></div><hr />

This is true for me as well. With my hybrid classes, I have either Heal/DPS or Tank/DPS combinations (sometimes even Tank/Heal), and I switch between specs often, but don't switch much between talents. With pure DPS, I have dualspec, but tend to stick to my favorite spec, because I only have optimised gear for my main spec, and also the most gaming experience. <br />
<br />
For me, costs for switching specs are detrimental, because I already am fixated on my main spec with better gear (and in Legion also with the Artifact weapon). I don't mind reagent costs for switching talents, especially when they are designed this way, so a whole group benefits from one consumable. Raiding guilds already have an infrastructure for such things, so they will not be affected that much.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think Blizzard was faced with the decision of either increasing the price for respeccing, or removing it entirely.

Making talent hoices &quot;meaningful&quot;? Now that's rich, after such a long time just needing the apropiate reagent to change them around (easy, cheap, needs out of combat). I'm personally disgusted with the anounced changes 'cuz I change talents a lot (rogue here); set the optimal ones for each raid encounter (not too many changes really), change the survival one for outdoor/soloing old content, many changes (including glyphs, not important as they're going away) while soloing Pandaria 25h raids on a boss per boss basis...hell, I even take Shuriken toss in the drake event in DS before Ultraxion just to make it quiker (could do with class trinket and the 20y Eviscerate but bite me...) and I could go on quite a bit more about this.<br />
So, forcing me to a safe zone or using some item aimed at &quot;groups&quot; in terms of time/reagents (think feasts in WotLK or cauldron in...was it Cata? yeah we grinded for it with the whole raid xD) instead of just out of combat and having a stock of vanishing powder/tome of the clear mind to do it sounds like they are taking away part of my freedom...kinda.<br />
Now, in terms of making your choices meaningful (more) I can somewhat see why they're doing something like that, and obviously I get most of the implications making them instant &amp; free (just one I just thought of; if it was so, everyone would expect everyone to change on the fly between trash, boss, whatever, always getting the best talents for a given moment in the dungeon, raid, everywhere and ppl thad won't, like me, too lazy changing from one trash to another will be seen as inferior or similar, gimping the group and kicked out...). <br />
End result, I'm not convinced but hey, it's their game and we are still playing for a reason so let's just hope they do it in a way that won't make us change our own way of playing the game (not talking classes here, in any way).</div></div><hr />

You don't understand why it is a stupid idea, some specs have very situational talents that are incredibly powerful in that situation.<br />
<br />
Like Unholy Death Knights and Epidemic, that means a trip to a Main City or Class Hall in the middle of the raid. &quot;Oh look lets hold up the raid for 5 minutes while one guy has to derp around&quot; so basically limiting things to free changes subsidizes Inscriptionists or makes warlocks a must have for every raid team.

<br />
<br />
This is why people are bitching. Because of the major inconvenience to simply swap a talent. Nobody cares if there's a minor gold cost like 10g for a new kind of tome required to swap talents. People were bitching at the concept of it costing them thousands upon thousands of gold to swap specs, when often that's at the request of someone else, not their own choice. A lot of those people didn't actually go and sit in beta and work out how much it cost to swap, like mmo-champion has only just posted. Especially since when mmo-champ first reported on the fact it's going to cost an increasing amount of gold per swap, they didn't give even a single BALLPARK figure, and people feared for the worst.<br />
<br />
I understand that they want to deter people from swapping between every single pull, and fair enough, but a better way to do that would be to make it so you have to be out of combat for 30 seconds before being able to change talents. Nobody's going to make a group sit there and wait 30 seconds before the next pull just to save 15 seconds on that pack of mobs in a dungeon. But if you genuinely wanted to change talents for a difficult boss or something, you're going to have to either drop this new inscription-made table that'll probably set you back a fairly hefty amount to buy to be able to use on a whim, or hearth and get summoned back, because there's no other way to do it. And if nobody in the group happens to have the table on them at the time, and you don't have a warlock in the group, then you're completely SoL. That's absolutely retarded. That's not a deterrent, that's a punishment.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well to be fair, some people enjoyed the old talent system more, and one of the advantages of the new talent system was that it allowed you to basicly make different &quot;loadouts&quot; for different fights/situations, despite being more simplistic overall.<br />
<br />
If it becomes something you can't really change &quot;on demand&quot;, it will just become forgetable for most people, something you change very infrequently if the meta changes (for more dedicated players) or if you feel bored / want to try something different.<br />
<br />
It's just another layer of choice/variety being hampered. Instead of talents, they become simply more abilities in your spellbook that you can maybe change later after the raid. It's pretty sour for someone who liked the old system.</div></div><hr />

At first i thought its april fools joke but then i realized its not april. So now i will have to beg scribe to make me tome each time i trying to change talent? Im mythic raider and im not changing talents to have &quot;all abilities available and a lengthy spellbook&quot; /facepalm what a nonsense, im changing talents to utilize my spec as much as possible. That means example when we are proceeding from single target boss fight mechanic into a trash before next boss, im changing my talents to AOE so we can clear trash as fast as possible. And who cares if u can re talent before every pull. Unless you could re talent in the middle of the fight, really WHO CARES? Talents will be swapped before every boss anyway, but now before i know which talents i should pick, for like every other pull on same boss on progress i have to drop this item so i can test which talents are the best. There is theory crafting, but many times talents which seem the best at the time, are not actually the best, and only way to find out is to test it yourself. Who is even coming up with those ideas. I bet its the same person who made Garrison :O</div></div><hr />

Like Unholy Death Knights and Epidemic, that means a trip to a Main City or Class Hall in the middle of the raid. &quot;Oh look lets hold up the raid for 5 minutes while one guy has to derp around&quot; so basically limiting things to free changes subsidizes Inscriptionists or makes warlocks a must have for every raid team. If they are going to make a cost to switch around talents go back to Tomes of the Mind so I can buy 3 stacks and not have to worry about it.<br />

There will be a consumable item which can be crafted by scribes and used by anyone to allow people to change talents in an instance, working for a whole group. There are your tomes.</div></div><hr />

Changing specs in Legion will no longer cost gold!<br />
Changing talents will be free in a city or your Order Hall.<br />
Changing talents out in the field will require a reagent crafted by Inscription with a cost aimed at groups.<br />
Currently, talent changes are free and instant out of combat, which isn't restrictive enough.<br />
In the current build the system that is going away worked like this:<br />
You could change from any spec to your primary spec for free, with your primary spec set at a class trainer.<br />
Your first respec was free, with a cooldown of less than 24 hours to reset the cost to free again.<br />
After that, respecs were 19, 39, 58, and capping at 78, with a 24 hour cooldown to drop one cost level each time you changed specs.<br />
<br />

doesn't the bolded part basically say that the cost is going away? yet i still see people on beta forums raging about it?</div></div><hr />

No they're implementing a new cost, you need to be in a safe zone (IE City, Order Hall) or have a scribe drop an item on the ground that you stand near and can use to swap talents...in order to swap talents. You cannot just do it anywhere OOC (Unless near a said scribe dropped tome, no idea if it will be group restricted either IE need to be in group to use a-la portals) So any scribe will have to bring a metric buttload of them for raid since we can't rely on supplying our own means of doing talent swaps anymore, or you have to let people hearth out before bosses(or certain trash packs if its near the start of the xpac/is especially difficult trash) if you have no scribe/ran out of tomes to drop on the ground.</div></div><hr />

Well because for some classes you respecc allot, for example i main a warrior so lets see how that is in HFC.<br />
<br />
1. Boss i have to start as a Fury with full AoE talentes, after that i respecc to Arms for Reaver (if i know he is down in 1 Phase, or single target Fury if he is going to air phase). <br />
Then again respecc to Fury with full AoE for trash and Komrog - Arms for Council after that and so on and so on. And ofc all the later harder trash packs where you adapt your talents for just 2 or 3 packs of mobs and change back after that. And how will that look in progress when you have a harder time in those situations?<br />
By the sounds of it, i cant farm enough gold to use 30 or more of these Inscription thingis per raid.<br />
<br />
Its just that i as a raider want to be suited perfectly for each given situation. With that new systen i would either need a Mage to make me a portal every 5 minutes and a WL to summon me back or i could pick a build where im an allrounder, some AoE, some single target but not really good in neither. Both options sound really really really fun right? Not really. <br />
<br />
The way it was worked perfectly it least in regards to raiding, they could have just made the dual spec to tripple spec (quadro spec for druids) and it would be even better.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Except that everyone can drop it. <br />
<br />
They way I see it the main difference between wod and legion is gold cost for changing talents.<br />
<br />
In wod you can freely switch between two preferred specs, and they can even be the same spec with two different talent setups. You talents can be changed with a regent that you can get from a vendor or a scribe. <br />
<br />
In legion you'll be able to switch between all you different specialisations (two for DH, four for druids, and three for the rest). Your talents can be changed for free in cities or with an item you get from a scribe. <br />
<br />
The difference is the price of the talent tome. No one know this price yet, and it may turn out cheaper for a full raid group taking gold inflation into account. <br />
<br />
The place it does make a small difference is soloing content. Leveling, farming and/or old content. If you are so in to min/max that you change talents between pulls in that environment, then there is something to complain about.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">teverin</div><div class="date">2016-05-17, 01:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">They should just adopt the system Guild Wars 2 has. You can change spec/talents whenever you want (except in certain pvp activities and in combat). It just makes things more fluid and you feel as if you have more control over how your character plays. <br />
<br />
They throw in these bullshit scenarios like...First, what if you could switch talents freely, at any time, including while in combat? or Second, what if you could literally never switch talents, short of making a brand new character? <br />
<br />
So once they establish that they are doing us a favor by picking middle ground, they don't give any thought into something other than giving it a cost. There are games out there (GW2) that do not have costs and it still feels meaningful when you change something.<br />
<br />
If anything should be free to change it should be talents. I would think that going into a group or raid you would have who is playing what spec all figured out and if need be you can go to a city to change for free OR pay on the spot. But talents, which are much more dynamic and can change per fight should be something more accessible.</div></div><hr />

I assume you are in a hardcore raiding guild if you need to min/max so much. In that case you are not the only one needing to change talents, and therefor you would only need to buy around one of those tomes, as the rest of the raid also can bring some.</div></div><hr />

I don't think I heard anyone complain about 'I have to buy potions for every pull to maximize my usefulness to the raid, they are giving alchemists too much power'. Or swapping gems in and out if one stat is better for AoE than another. The thing is just that it is something that you got used to do for 'free' (since tomes are so easy to buy) to something that costs something. In the end, hardcore raiders will stack up on tomes and still change, less hardcore raiders will not bother to swap. People did not swap specs or talents all the time before the tome system and just played a spec that could adapt best to most situations.</div></div><hr />

May be the inscription item will be more costly, so what, go make some gold or add inscription as a trade skill and make your own. Trade skills no longer make a significant impact or group/raid content anyhow. <br />

People are such babies, no one has all the information yet somehow a majority of folks are screaming the sky is falling already. Same people who complained about the incremental cost of respecing, which was to be capped at 78g and had a 24-hour decay. <br />
<br />
If you think you need to min-max on trash for raids or 5-mans then you seriously need to reevaluate your group/raid skill level. <br />
<br />
This is the new plan, do you think that they will make the new inscription item so rare or hard to get that the alternative for raids will be, people hearthing back to town and being summoned constantly? Now I know you all feel blizzard is a bunch of idiots, but come on they are not that stupid. They know currently it looks like that is the best option we would come up with to circumvent their design intent, which will break the goal. Which means they will have to stop it by either making summons in raid zones not work, or they will need to make the inscription items fairly simple to make (like feasts). <br />
<br />
Come on folks, at least try to be adults here, explain why you feel this should not go live and keep the sky is falling, blizzard is stupid, this is the dimmest idea ever posts for another time.</div></div><hr />

What restrictions? It's just like now where you need an item to change talents. Only that Scribes make it instead of it being from a vendor, and when you're in cities it's free.</div></div><hr />

Because the numbers were crunched and X is better than the Y I already have by 5%? Come on.<br />
<br />
So, yeah, I'm all in favor of having a certain &quot;lock&quot; in place on talents to make you embrace your decision more and also not be beholden to these know-it-alls who tell you to spec otherwise at every turn.</div></div><hr />

I have never, in my time playing this game, read or heard a convincing argument as to why this would be a good idea.</div></div><hr />

What, locking down classes to certain roles again? Do you even RPG bro? Warriors should tank, clerics should heal, and warlocks should DPS, I don't seem to understand what is wrong with making WoW back into an actual RPG. Classes should fulfil certain roles within a group, and one class being able to fill every role breaks down group forming, group reliance, and eventually the game's community. <br />
<br />
MMORPGs became incredibly popular because they forced players into certain roles that generally required other's roles as well to be successful, and in this genre that is in fact a very good thing. Being able to switch roles on the fly may seem like a quality of life improvement, but it actually breaks down the gameplay aspect of the MMORPG.</div></div><hr />

There are plenty of high fantasy MMOs out there (Everquest, EQ2, Vanguard) WoW has never and will never be one of them.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">luckydan79</div><div class="date">2016-05-18, 02:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well because for some classes you respecc allot, for example i main a warrior so lets see how that is in HFC.<br />
<br />
1. Boss i have to start as a Fury with full AoE talentes, after that i respecc to Arms for Reaver (if i know he is down in 1 Phase, or single target Fury if he is going to air phase). <br />
Then again respecc to Fury with full AoE for trash and Komrog - Arms for Council after that and so on and so on. And ofc all the later harder trash packs where you adapt your talents for just 2 or 3 packs of mobs and change back after that. And how will that look in progress when you have a harder time in those situations?<br />
By the sounds of it, i cant farm enough gold to use 30 or more of these Inscription thingis per raid.<br />
<br />
Its just that i as a raider want to be suited perfectly for each given situation. With that new systen i would either need a Mage to make me a portal every 5 minutes and a WL to summon me back or i could pick a build where im an allrounder, some AoE, some single target but not really good in neither. Both options sound really really really fun right? Not really. <br />
<br />
The way it was worked perfectly it least in regards to raiding, they could have just made the dual spec to tripple spec (quadro spec for druids) and it would be even better.<br />
<br />
It means by your description that the game is badly designed now, changing specs at will is now just silly and stupid and loses the individuality of classes, in other-words they have TOO MANY FUCKING SPECS!!!! and really need to tone them down but don't expect much change from WOD to Legion people it's gonna be the same day in and day out. <br />
<br />
Talents are silly as well... They should be more selective passives which powers up respective abilities... instead of letting you select which spells your gonna use, they said that back in MOP you shouldn't need to select talents but now the design has changed, they might as well change the name of the game World of Diablocraft. Designing the game around raiding and PVP there isn't gonna be much of a change from WOD and they haven't learnt what they have done wrong in that game at all.<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
I have never, in my time playing this game, read or heard a convincing argument as to why this would be a good idea.<br />
<br />
It's only a good idea if classes are well designed, they actually gone back and truncated all the abilities instead of inspired to have more.<br />
<br />
They were going the right idea by adding a little edge so healers can DPS and so forth but reverted back to the FFXIV model where changing weapons means changing a whole class. They might as well congeal all the specs into one and use the artifact weapons to power up certain abilities.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Verris</div><div class="date">2016-05-18, 12:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think if they just made it so you couldn't buy talent tomes from vendors but instead have a scribe make them, then that would make inscription good and would allow people to buy the tomes at a decent cost 10 gold each imo.<br />
<br />
This 'talent feast' idea however, is terribly wonky.<br />
Let's say you killed boss 1, and now are trying boss 2, you drop your talent feast for the 7-8 people that want to use it for boss 2, fair enough. Let's say you wipe, and 2-3 people want to change talents, do you drop a feast for only 2-3 people? 1-2 people the next attempt?...<br />
<br />
I don't think this change is thought out enough. Then again, it could be a talent feast is very cheap, well that would mean we're back to the same system now, where you have someone in the raid dropping it before every pull (like with the current food feast), negating the change to begin with and making it all frivolous and stupid.<br />
<br />
If switching talents cost 10 gold and you could do it with your own tome for only yourself, I would be totally fine with that since you want to think a little about what you want to change, but having to ask for the raid leader to drop it 5-6 times during the week in raids is just frustrating, I can only imagine hearing someone ask for it after every freaking pull, or people running with god awful talents because they never had the convenience outside the 'safe zone' to experiment with other stuff.<br />
<br />
This change creates something superficial and takes out so much depth.</div></div><hr />
