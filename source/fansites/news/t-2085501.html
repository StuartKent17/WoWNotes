<br />
The BlizzCon 2016 online merchandise sale for attendees and Virtual Ticket holders is now scheduled to kick off October 12!<br />
<br />
While you wait for the store to open, check out the preview below for a sneak peek at just a sample of what’s coming to the store.<br />
<br />
If you’d like to participate in this year’s BlizzCon sale, simply order a BlizzCon 2016 Virtual Ticket (https://us.battle.net/shop/en/product/blizzcon-virtual-ticket). Once you purchase your Virtual Ticket, your Battle.net account will automatically be flagged to purchase BlizzCon items from the Blizzard Gear Store during the sale, from October 12 to November 6.<br />
<br />
If you’re attending the show in person, you should have already received a code to redeem this year’s digital bonuses—including a Virtual Ticket and access to the BlizzCon merch sale—on one Battle.net account. These codes were emailed directly to ticket buyers, so if you received a ticket through a friend or family member, check with them for your code.<br />
<br />
<br />
Patch 7.1 Reputation Changes<br />
Reputation will not be made account-wide, no, but we will be easing a couple of linked features with 7.1.<br />
<br />
First, Court of Stars and The Arcway will now unlock account-wide once each individual dungeon is completed once on an account.<br />
<br />
Second, World Quests will no longer have the &quot;friendly&quot; reputation unlock requirement for secondary/alt characters. Once you hit 110 on an alt, you will immediately receive a quest to speak with Khadgar to receive your Flight Master's Whistle and unlock World Quests, as long as you've already unlocked World Quests on your main.<br />
<br />
Hope this answers your concerns!<br />
<br />

Hunter Feedback<br />
Popping in to say we've been reading all the feedback here, and we have really appreciated everything posted so far.<br />
<br />
We've already made some changes based off feedback we've received in this thread and others, and we will continue to iterate and tune classes as needed. I don't have any direct updates on what changes will be coming when for Hunters, but the class is definitely on our radar.

Hi, is Fury of the Eagle meant to be on the GCD? It was off GCD initially, but there has been no official response post hotfix<br />
Yes. Fury of the Eagle (a standard damage ability) bypassing the GCD was incorrect, and we hotfixed it to be on the GCD as intended. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/781977927265103872))<br />

I will never understand why pople buy toys and &quot;dust covers&quot;. They should collect homeless people and spend the money on them... far more remunerative in the long term.<br />
You should know most of those toys end up in trash containers after you die by your grandchildren cleaning up after you.</div></div><hr />

I just leveled a rogue from 100 to 110 on the PTR. At 100 all I did was go around tanaan jungle and opening treasure chests, mostly for gear, though I was getting 30k XP per chest/treasure, so it was fast. 101 to 107 was class hall, profession and one zone worth of quests (the naga/blue dragon zone). 107 to 110 was highmountain. I never touched stormheim or the druid zone (val'something?). <br />
<br />
It wasn't slow at all, but there should be a couple reps I haven't even touched, so it's definitely something that might be happening to a lot of people.</div></div><hr />

It's all a matter of how you level. As some people said before, doing Dungeons is a slow way that still gets you there. Personally I started in Highmountain with my druid twink. Between doing dungeons for quests, following a few inscription quest lines and pushing the EXP-Champion missions, I was at 109.5 by the time I was done there. 4 Reputations to go. <br />
...and I still had fun! I'm weird.</div></div><hr />

Doing an entire instance still gives ~20% xp while rested. Coupled with the fact that my alt is a tank and I get insta-queue, it's still a pretty good way of levelling casually an alt. The only problem is (was) the rep grind after hitting 110.</div></div><hr />

I feel that it could have been made better.. <br />

<br />
Because the spirits respawning was a terrible decision and served to just make wiping a frustrating experience. There's a clear cut difference between content that increases the skill requirement, and content that doesn't really increase the skill requirement, but is frustrating or overly punishing for no good reason. This is more of a QoL change than anything; the difficulty of Arcway was never pinned on the spirits respawning. But having to clear shit you cleared already after wiping is NOT fun. It's just a waste of time.<br />
<br />
<br />
What do they mean by sealing the Dreamway portals. Why would you want to do that?<br />
<br />
quests in feralas involve sealing the portal from the other side. People who have done this quest can in theory unseal the portal again from the dreamway side but due to a phasing bug only some druids were able to do this. Unless you were a druid specifically affected by this bug then it shouldn't even matter to you...</div></div><hr />

<br />
People already answered you, but yeah, that's not the situation for everyone. Dungeons + any dungeon quests you may happen to find + class hall player XP mission rewards can enable you to hit 110 well before you reach friendly in all of the zones. Hell, in the beta, I hit 110 before ever setting foot in Stormheim. (I made sure that didn't happen in live, since I knew better.) Especially on alts, where you probably aren't going to be playing it nonstop as you level, meaning more time for class hall XP missions, it can be quite helpful.<br />
---<br />
I wonder if the removal of the rep requirement will be retroactive. Right now I've only bothered to level one alt, but it's possible I may do a few more before 7.1 hits. If I already have a character sitting at 110, still on the Uniting the Isles quest, will I be able to move past it without having to finish it? Or should I wait until 7.1? I wish they would have specifically addressed this.</div></div><hr />

Previous expac rep should be made account wide, or at least the rewards from them.<br />
<br />
I grinded out a lot of factions, and i have a tabard fetish. And this expac i switched classes, so now i can't mog any of the rep reward stuff i've collected over the years, namely tabards. <br />

It's a nonsense rule for factions that are no longer relevant to the current expac.</div></div><hr />
