<br />
The goal is to combine new gameplay with most fun parts of the past. <br />
The plan is to get people back into the world, instead of having players roam around Stormwind and Orgrimmar all the time once they reach max level. <br />
Developers want you to do what you want to do to progress your character. They really want you to feel like you have a menu of content where you can pick whatever you want to do, and you shouldn't feel forced to do something to progress your character. For example, daily quests will reward you with valor points but it will still be faster if you raid of course. <br />
Character builds are going to be entirely revamped. Talents were still too cookie cutter, so the developers want to give players more choices in their talents.<br />

Creatures of Pandaria<br />
<br />
The Jinyu are fish-like creatures and will be in a wide number of zones. <br />
The Hozu are a monkey-like race, they stand up on their legs and can walk around. They play tons of pranks on the local pandarens and are also in a lot of zones. <br />
Verming are ... new kobolds, they kinda look like evil bunnies. <br />
Mantid: Whole raids and dungeons around this race. Insect race that has been there since the beginning of ages. They have been seperated by a giant wall. They are starting to go crazy and are going through the wall<br />
Mogu: Ancient race, original race on pandaria. The mogu want the island back from the pandaren, they are really mad. You will see them in dungeons.<br />
Sha: Manifestation of the evil energies that flow through the earth. If there is any sort of battle these guys pop up. <br />

The Jade Forest<br />
<br />
This is where Alliance and Horde will be landing. The horde is washing up on the north side, the alliance on the south side. There will be one unified start zone and Alliance/Horde will end up meeting up in the middle.<br />
Lush rainforests and stone spires<br />
The Alliance will try to become friend with the Hozu, and the Horde with the Jinyu and will try to turn them against each other. <br />
Temple of the Jade Serpent will be the dungeon of this zone. It will be your 85-86 Dungeon, it has been taken over by Sha<br />
<br />

Monk Equipment<br />
<br />
Leather Armor (Agility or Intellect)<br />
They hit a lot with hands and feet<br />
They will need weapons for some finishers: Staves, Fist Weapons<br />
They will also be able to use 1H Axe and maces, swords<br />
Healers will get off-hands, they don't want healers to use shields. <br />
<br />
<br />
Monk Resources<br />
<br />
Chi (energy) slowly regenerates and is only used for your Jab and Roll abilities.<br />
Jab generates Light and Dark force, which are used for everything else. Some finishing move uses dark force, some use the light force.<br />
No auto attack! Devs want you to have this street fighter feel where you punch a lot<br />
<br />

<br />
Cataclysm Talents<br />
<br />
Pro - The level 10 specs were really nice and gave you a role early in the game, definitely a keeper.<br />
Pro - Removing junk from the talent trees was also a very good move.<br />
Pro - Having some kind of choices for optional skills/subspecs worked out pretty well.<br />
Con - You had a risk of &quot;skipping&quot; important talents<br />
Con - There wasn't enough junk removed<br />
Con - There wasn't enough choices, you might have a different final talent point than another combat rogue but it just wasn't enough. The cookie cutter build still persists.<br />
Con - No enough customization, no true hybridization (Using a little bit of 2 different trees)<br />
Con - Players got grumpy<br />
<br />
<br />
Talent System 2.0<br />
<br />
The talent system is gone! Ok, not really, but it's greatly changed.<br />
You now have your class abilities, your spec abilities, and your talents.<br />
You still choose your spec at level 10, and you get a spec ability at level 10. You will get additional spec abilities later. There are anything that you really need to function, they will just be given to you to make sure you have all the tools you need to have. <br />
<br />
<br />
Example - Prot Paladin<br />
<br />
LVL 10 - Avenger's Shield<br />
LVL 20 - Hammer of the Righteous (Prot and Ret)<br />
LVL 30 - Judgement of the Just (Passive)<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Talents<br />
<br />
There is not talent points or ranks.<br />
There is one talent pree per class.<br />
You earn talents every 15 levels.<br />
You get to choose 1 out of 3 every time you get a new point, you can only pick one of them and can't go back to get the other ones.<br />
There will be no mandatory talent. There won't be any cookie cutter build or anything, it will depend on what kind of optional ability you want.<br />
You can now change talents as easily as you change glyphs. <br />
More info in the Talent Tree Panel at 2:15<br />

<br />
PvE Scenarios<br />
<br />
PvE Scenarios are a way to give new interesting content that doesn't make sense in a dungeon content. <br />
Scenarios are more about reusing parts of the world in interesting new ways, and introducing new types of PvE gameplay that we've never seen before like PvE battlegrounds.<br />
They are short instances for a few players, the amount of players can vary depending on the scenario, some of them can be for 3 players.<br />
You don't need the typical tank/heal/dps setup, you will just be able to enter and play your role no matter what it is.<br />
It will be a staged experience where you will try to accomplish some greater goal<br />
For example, a scenario might require you to kill 25 kobolds in stage 1, then find and return 4 goldshire children, and then kill the boss. <br />
Developers would like to do PvE battlegrounds, where you will have to slay 50 alliance/horde soldiers, destroy 6 towers and the barracks, and then defeat the enemy General. <br />
They could replace group quests.<br />
It uses the same queue system as the dungeon finder<br />
Since there is no role requirements, queues should be instant.<br />

<br />
<br />
Questing<br />
<br />
Increased focus on max level content, it will reward you with Valor Points. <br />
Incentives for dungeons/raiders to run quests and do outdoor/daily kind of stuff. For example finishing a quest might give you a buff for the day, and maybe that buff will let you roll on a loot that only appears to people with that buff.<br />
More quest choices, and a lot less linear<br />
No flying until max level, it's much easier to keep people on the ground and create interesting quests when you know people won't just fly away and drop on the boss.<br />
Faction improvements, there will be group of factions and they will let you work for all factions from that group to get your rewards. This way you don't have to grind a single faction anymore.<br />

<br />
Major Class Changes<br />
Resilience<br />
<br />
Devs like the way Resilience works in PvP, and how it gives a nice goal for players looking to progress/upgrade their gear in PvP<br />
Resilience is a pretty huge barrier for people who want to start PvPing.<br />
Resilience will become a base stat, and will increase a little every time you level. <br />
<br />
<br />
Ranged Weapons<br />
<br />
Hunter minimum range is gone!<br />
Hunter melee weapon is gone!<br />
Ranged slot for all other characters are gone.<br />
Relics are gone.<br />
Rogues and warriors can now throw their melee weapon<br />
Wands become main hand weapons<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/iwarlocks.gif Warlock<br />
<br />
Unique resource for each spec. <br />
Affliction will keep Soul Shards, they are currently not interesting enough but devs have cool ideas for them.<br />
Demonology will get Demonic Fury, you build up Demonic Fury and you metamorphosize when you max your Demonic Fury. More skills will be added to Demon Form, etc ...<br />
Destruction will get Infernal Embers. The destruction warlock who keeps getting casting fire spells get hotter and hotter and will eventually deal insane amount of damage, you can build it up pretty quickly and unleash your big spell.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ishamans.gif Shaman<br />
<br />
Buff totems are gone. It just wasn't very interesting to be the buff bitch of the group.<br />
All totems are now utility<br />
New totem examples:<br />
Earthgrab totem - roots<br />
Repulsion totem - repels<br />
Bulwark Totem - absorbs<br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/idruids.gif Druid <br />
<br />
They always felt like they had 4 specs, so now they do. <br />
Feral - Cat (melee dps)<br />
Guardian - bear (tanking)<br />
Some overlap between the two<br />
All druids can still go cat or bear form.<br />
<br />
<br />
All classes<br />
<br />
Spell books cleaned up, got rid of more junk, the goal is to clean up action bars a little more without removing the fun things.<br />
Rotations will be improved<br />
Spells will be automatically learned, you won't have to go to your trainer anymore. <br />
You will get a new spell at level 87, level 90 new talent point.<br />
Talent trees should be fun, and you should have more choice than just a cookie cutter build.<br />
<br />
<br />

I don't have high hopes for this expansion, especially since they will be changing the classes so damn much again. 4 expansions, 4 new paladin classes that you have to relearn how to play.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not necessarily. No central villain does not necessary preclude raiding. It just redefines what it is we're raiding, why we're raiding, etc. Instead of steadily progressing through the enemy's lieutenants, we might end up doing more &quot;war against the opposing faction&quot; style stuff.</div></div><hr />

...<br />
<br />
I'am sure they reduced the number of talents with cata because there was too much talents. They don't know what to do whith WoW anymore...<br />

I sense a lot of the 'features' in this xpac will be direct responses to other MMOs. I dunno.. this whole 'no bad guy' approach.. not sure it will work. We'll see. Perhaps they've realised the bad guy was only ever seen by 5% of the player base and no one really cared about the lich king or deathwing for the majority of the expansion.I'm surprised they didn't drop any hints of another xpac to follow soon after this one. It's gotta be on the cards.</div></div><hr />

They really want you to feel like you have a menu of content where you can pick whatever you want to do, and you shouldn't feel forced to do something to progress your character. I read this and thought, finally they are going to expand the game and make it fun again. They're going to get creative and give us something original.Then I read this:<br />
For example, daily quests will reward you with valor points but it will still be faster if you raid of course.And I realized that they are fresh out of creativity. They think all they have to do is make the game easier and easier. That could be great for a lot of people, but there are a lot of us that can already get the best rewards without your easy mode access to the same stuff. Anything new and inventive for us? No? So why are you calling this an expansion?Oh, a new class and race. Whooptie Fricken Doo</div></div><hr />

I couldn't stand the constant time-management it took to raid, especially when they lost their luster for me. This new PuG system may alleviate that though with Raid finder.

You can now change talents as easily as you change glyphs. go on blizz.. so far you gave me like 10 reasons to stop palying and 1 to play (if nicely designed zones can count for reason to keep playing lol) earning talent point every 2 levels is already boring as cfuck... why do we even keep levels in the game? leveling will feel even more like a chore than anything else...You will care only about getting 15 levels not every single one of them.

<br />
All major talents are yours automatically, and the rest (only one every 15 levels - so a total of SIX, and the same for all 3 specs) are going to be unrelated to spec, and therefore pure utility. The glyph system is now more spec-specific than is the freaking talent system, and both of them, combined, have no depth at all.<br />

In all honestly, I can't see it being worse than it is now, but I have a hard time believing that they will make the talents interesting enough while not being mandatory, because in all honestly, talents become a lot more interesting the more needed they are. Sort of inversely proportionate in a sense.</div></div><hr />

But thinking it over...it looks like they're giving us different brands/types of cookie instead of asking us to make our own. Okay, they've simplified it, and those talent points are probably going to be utility, but then isn't that pretty much what we've been asking for? We don't know the specifics yet, say one of the utilities is a bloodlust ability, but on the same line is an ability that can battle rez? or perform a powerful raid wide heal? Obviously these are just speculative examples, so for now, I don't think we should judge too harshly, or too kindly, it's interesting, but lets wait for more details before outright condemnation.</div></div><hr />

Asia theme with Mantids as enemies, jade-based zone and the Scenarios which sound pretty much like the missions in Guild Wars.<br />
<br />
Just some days ago I thought about returning to WoW, just to have a look.But by now it seems they only put their spare resources on WoW.<br />
I got the feeling, Blizzard does not want to create anything great, storywise. <br />
<br />
I find, WoW costs quite too much for what it delivers.<br />
If Blizzard decides to copy Guild Wars,they really should change their paying system to that of Guild Wars, too<br />
(just taking money for the expansions, delivering content for free). <br />
<br />

Addition: Wow, now Blizzard copies Pokemon!</div></div><hr />

That sounds tedious, to be honest. One reason: It doesn't seem to take into account maxed players going back to finish lowbie quests (for achievement, giggles, whatever). The only way for my sister, Alayea, to do that in many instances - where the mob must be hurt but not killed - was stripping off all her gear and auto-attacking barehanded.</div></div><hr />

holy hahahahahahaha batman<br />
now you not only don't need to raid to get raid gear, you dont' even have to do anything with other people to get it.simply amazingSWTOR's subscription numbers keep getting higher and higher with every panel<br />
<br />
Blizzard said that valour points will be nothing but a consolation prize from 4.3, so the gear basically won't be bad, but it won't be as good as the gear you can get from raiding. So, if raiding (even normal-mode) still gets you the best gear available, why are you whining? Other than for the sake of trying to whine.<br />
<br />
Goes for the rest of you whining about this crap, too. Valour is just consolation. It will not make you the best, it is not giving away the best gear. It's giving away decent gear you can use in the current tier of raiding, but will quickly replace once you step in. Stop whining over every single detail you see, ffs.<br />
<br />
But who am I kidding. You're all going to whine over everything, regardless of what it might be.</div></div><hr />

That sounds tedious, to be honest. One reason: It doesn't seem to take into account maxed players going back to finish lowbie quests (for achievement, giggles, whatever). The only way for my sister, Alayea, to do that in many instances - where the mob must be hurt but not killed - was stripping off all her gear and auto-attacking barehanded.<br />

yeah it seems like they are trying to put in stuff from GW2 and SWTOR, but it just looks like they are doing it all wrong.

I realize that it's kinda weird to get epic gear for not doing raids (or heroics, though I don't exactly agree with that either), but dailies always eventually got you to gear that you could use for pve. Reputation was mainly from dailies, and you get epics from that, as well as firelands dailies where you get epic gear after weeks of boredom. Unless they make it so you get a lot of VP per daily, then it shouldn't actually be much different And also, if you are 5 VP away from buying your upgraded chestpiece, but really don't want to do a raid or entire dungeon to get enough to push you over, wouldn't you want some way to get a few VP?</div></div><hr />

Absolutely none. Everyone looks up the spec that they are supposed to use, and they use it. There is no reason to do anything else. If they are doing these new talent systems like I assume they are doing them, you are going to have to make a meaningful choice when you pick talents. That's what talents are all about, after all, not just there so that everyone plays exactly the same. Call me a fanboi but they are doing the exact things you are asking them to do, then you spit in their faces as usual.</div></div><hr />

I currently play the game at times, and even though its still going through its entire rebuild, the gameplay is so much fun. 1 character learn every class possible, and mix abilites into the class you play mainly :) I am not an altoholic, so even getting to do every profession and gathering profession is a huge plus then what WoW allows me to do on 1 single character:)</div></div><hr />

I'm for one glad that content is being diversified, though the idea is great the execution is what really matters so will have to see on that count. I mean ingame pokemon nice touch, might not be your thing but pokemon has a huge following and it's a simple combat system etc so not too much development time for extra entertainment. A potential fixed talent system that blizzard still hasn't gotten right, if anything the original system was better then current one atleast was when only went to 60 so didn't have so many points to deal with.</div></div><hr />

There is one talent pree per class. You earn talents every 15 levels. You get to choose 1 out of 3 every time you get a new point, you can only pick one of them and can't go back to get the other ones. There will be no mandatory talent. There won't be any cookie cutter build or anything, it will depend on what kind of optional ability you want. You can now change talents as easily as you change glyphs. It's about time; they should have done this 6 years ago. The talent system was always a pointless headache, devoid of any real choices.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Exactly! That's not something I would ever have expected from Blizzard 10 - or even 5 - years ago. The free D3/mount/etc. just shows how desperate they are to sleaze a year's worth of sub fees out of customers upfront, and then be able to claim a certain number of subs for a full year's worth of earnings reports.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Evenios</div><div class="date">2011-10-21, 09:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think it will be very cool the pet system seems rather interesting and yes yes one could make the arugment that oh my gosh its catering to kids, its like pokemon blah blah blah. So what? Nothing wrong with being a kid at heart and i think if your not amused sometimes by shiney new things then you just have lost the excitement in your life. I think anything that adds new content to the game is good as long as its interesting and the landscapes seem nice and the new features seem cool. I LOVE the idea of PVE content where you dont have to wait in long lines for the right &quot;class'. I hope down the road they will open this up more too. I think it will be a fun addon and maybe after the breaking of the world we need something a bit more peaceful. I am sure they will be an end boss and a host of cool baddies to fight and i think people need to just be happy and not worry so much!</div></div><hr />

So far Mists of Pandaria seems to just be adding different types of content for all the different types of players. Sorry that it's not PVE raid only content. I'm for one glad that content is being diversified, though the idea is great the execution is what really matters so will have to see on that count. I mean ingame pokemon nice touch, might not be your thing but pokemon has a huge following and it's a simple combat system etc so not too much development time for extra entertainment. A potential fixed talent system that blizzard still hasn't gotten right, if anything the original system was better then current one atleast was when only went to 60 so didn't have so many points to deal with.</div></div><hr />
