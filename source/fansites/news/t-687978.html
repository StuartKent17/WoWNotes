I did my best to make it a lot better for the end-user, if you have any constructive feedback about the tournament I'd love to hear it. <br />

If you just want to troll about something, I suggest that you just find a gnome or a death knight tank in-game.</div></div><hr />

I checked all my folders multiple times. I've been basically spamming F5 for about 10-15 minutes. And yes I used a hotmail account for the paypal purchase. I'm getting pissed...I want to see this shit and I paid. And &quot;To ensure delivery of the email, add mlgpro.com to your contacts list.&quot; <br />
...mlgpro.com is not an email address...how can I add it? And this is the link from MMO front page.</div></div><hr />

Try requesting the code a 2nd time, apparently it works. We're working to see if we can get that resolved. (But it's not really an issue on our side and it mostly depends on Hotmail)</div></div><hr />

Email them from the email you bought the HD stream with and ask for a 2nd key and they will send it apparently.<br />
<br />
Why is there only 4 teams? this All-star tournament seems good but tommorow will be pretty boring watching only 4 teams and last time I bought a HD pass it lagged like shit so I'll pass this time, my internet fails with streams.<br />
<br />
Stream works fine in my Firefox you probably need the newest version or you have changed some settings but it has always worked here, never tried IE.</div></div><hr />

I don't care about watching this tournament live or anything, so now I have to sit here as this useless crap loads every single time I refresh the page or otherwise return. Can't you just provide a link? Do you get a kick-back each time those ads appear? Can't you hide it on a 2nd page or behind a spoiler tag so it only loads for the people who want it to? Did you not say in the previous post that:<br />
<br />
A new MLG WoW tournament is coming this week-end! The stream on the site should be slightly less intrusive than the previous ones and I'll try to make sure the tournaments are once again an enjoyable experience for everyone on the site.<br />
If you tried making it less intrusive, you failed. It is just as intrusive as all the others.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And no offence, but I think MMO champion is partners with the MLG so that is why they have the stream here, and it's a WOW site and guess what, the stream is WOW PVP so if you don't like it, disable flash or just stay away for 2 days but whinging about some stream isn't going to fix or change anything, accept it and move on.<br />
<br />
And iirc the stream used to be at the very top of the page so you saw it first and had to scroll down to see the news and now it's further down so I guess this is what he means with less intrusive aka less a pain in the arse, and if they put the stream on page 2 who the hell will see it?</div></div><hr />

Too bad its over. The &quot;clicky cheat still works&quot;, but you can't go full screen this way, at least the sound is perfect.<br />
<br />
I am just wondering why won't you leave the sound as it is in the HD steam ? Anyone who doesn't wanna pay 10$ will still be able to at least listen to the games without a headache caused by this low quality sound.</div></div><hr />

How about don't autoload the stream on the front page of the site? Put a &quot;click here to open streams&quot; button in, perhaps, or put it on a separate page altogether. As-is when trying to load MMO-Champion for the WoW news I get forced into a long load and huge memory resource jump on my PC while it loads streams I wasn't interested in seeing before news I was interested in seeing.<br />
<br />
Last time these went up someone posted exactly what to put into AdBlock to block these streams, but I've since reinstalled everything and that's not in my filter list anymore.<br />
<br />
Edit: Looks like those of you with ABP can just add a filter for ||live.mlgpro.com^ and you're set. Front page is all news again. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
thank y ou very much for that, was going to fiddlw tih ABP to get rid of this load of shite.<br />
<br />
Seriously, just... add it on a seperate pae, or make it so it doesn't auto load. after 6pm thrusday - monday I hae like NO bandwidth and a lot of other people ave to use the net too, it's not very nice =/ my net gets hogged by stuff like this and then I get it in the neck. I'm not even interested in whatever it is. So yeah, it's annoying = / can you just not.. make half a news post and then like... a cut? And under the cut goes to the full post with stream. IDK if you can get that onf orums, I hate forums but... <br />
<br />
I shouldn't have to be using an adblocker, to get rid of ome intrusive, bandwidth stealing stuff when I just came to look somethjing up quick. <br />
<br />
Seriously, pepole wouldnt' be pissed if you just made it so it didn't auto load and stuff.<br />
<br />
Or, just add a splash page, warning people about it and either give them a link to the forums to bypass it, or make a sepeerate thread with the stream and direct link it on the splash page. It would make a lot of people happy &lt;3. It gives people the options to not even have to use ABP, which, we shouldnt' have to be doign to visit a site.<br />
<br />
There's LOADS of alternative options. For mine, it's giong to be ABP and just stay from the site for like a week or however long it goes on for... but I'm sure we'll see yet another stream auto loading on our main page soon anyway.</div></div><hr />

MMO champ are partners or whatever with MLG so it makes sense to have the stream on the frontpage don't you think? it's retarded not to isn't it? and why not, because a few babies with shit PC's QQ because it takes an extra few seconds to load the page? maybe if you didn't QQ you would have more time to do what you wanted but instead you have free time to QQ yet not enough time to wait, the fuck? if it loads fast enough for you to come here and whine then you can go to other topics and do what you want to do so what is your problem?<br />
<br />
Anyway, the stream is down so what the fuck? was watching it, then it froze and now says no stream available, gay.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jin84</div><div class="date">2010-01-09, 11:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's a form of advertising. Hosting MMO-C on a webserver isn't free hosting for you to QQ about. MLG is paying for some of the hosting costs, that's why their adverts are plastered all over the main page. If it wasn't on the main page, I wouldn't have enjoyed the few hours long event on the free stream.<br />

HD froze for only a few minutes. Anyway, the day's event is over.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Actually, MLG owns this site. So the logic is more along the lines of &quot;despite the constant complaints when this thing is up, we have no say in the matter so we can't really change it&quot;.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I just ABP'd the shit out of it so there's just a black square on the frontpage. Kinda sucks that this site isn't worth visiting once in a while thanks to this stupid &quot;coverage&quot;.</div></div><hr />

If the webmaster was not interested in feedback, then they should not have said:<br />
<br />
<br />
I did my best to make it a lot better for the end-user, if you have any constructive feedback about the tournament I'd love to hear it.<br />
<br />
My constructive feedback is to not post streams on the front page. Not that it matters anymore, as now I installed AdBlock so the streams won't ever appear anymore. Unfortunately for MMO-Champ, that also means none of their other advertising will ever appear again for me to click on and help support the costs of running the servers. So in the process of putting streams on the front page that only X% of people care about seeing (in the hopes of getting more ad revenue or being forced to), they have cost themselves all the future potential revenue by annoying me to the point of downloading AdBlock. All of this could have been avoided by moving the streams to behind spoiler tags (the ones where you have to push the button before it would appear), putting the streams on a different page altogether, or otherwise simply providing a link.<br />
<br />
But, whatever. AdBlock is up and this page loads faster with less system resources, as it should have in the beginning.</div></div><hr />

Maybe it's my internet browser, but whatever you did kicks ass, awesome formatting and I hope you do it again for MLG streams in the future.<br />
<br />
On a side note, to the people having problems with the stream, I'm curious if you're a continuing customer from a previous stream because this *always* seems to happen. Is there some universal setting you need on your browser/firewall so that you can view it properly? It's seem as though there are many who need a quasi-guide of some sort.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chimpzilla</div><div class="date">2010-01-10, 02:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Is there a particular reason you have to post the Stream along with it's memory-hogging loading on the front page? I don't care about watching this tournament live or anything, so now I have to sit here as this useless crap loads every single time I refresh the page or otherwise return. Can't you just provide a link? Do you get a kick-back each time those ads appear? Can't you hide it on a 2nd page or behind a spoiler tag so it only loads for the people who want it to? Did you not say in the previous post that:If you tried making it less intrusive, you failed. It is just as intrusive as all the others.<br />
<br />
<br />
Can't you people just deal with it for a weekend. Did you ever consider that maybe stuff like this is what pays for this site to stay up and run so well. I'm pretty happy that the ads on the site remain fairly non intrusive. You can also easily block it yourself if you really wanted.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It no longer blocks the newest news&amp;posts thing and the &quot;No thanks&quot; is no longer a popup that annoys the hell out of everyone that isn't interested.<br />
<br />
Well done.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also, the video quality is so fucking crappy that it's not even fun. I'm not going to pay 10$ to watch arena matches that lasts for one day with a very low play/pause ratio. I mean, the pauses are 2x the length of the matches...</div></div><hr />

(Which honestly, MMOC is promoted as a WoW news site not a WoW video portal/tube and its simply MLGC being 'in your face', whether they host it or not. Auto load content like that is simply bad design and might as well be a 4000x4000 flash ad with sound spamming me 'BUY THIS' - at least they could have made it on demand. Notice in the past all video content posted is on demand except this coverage.. wouldn't surprise me if Boub has no choice about this.)</div></div><hr />
