The Scroll of Resurrection Retires<br />
The time has come to bid adieu to the Scroll of Resurrection. It’s served its divine purpose, but like most scrolls, it only has so many charges before it loses its magic and crumbles into ethereal dust. For those who’d still like a chance to use the scroll, you have until February 18 before players are no longer able to send invitations. For those who have an invitation outstanding, that’s still good for 30 days from the time it was sent, after which point the invitation will expire and the benefits can no longer be claimed.<br />
<br />

Yup it would appear Blizzard are going all out for the hard sell of returning players buying WoD with the free level 90 as the only way they can return to the game. Makes sense I suppose from their perspective.</div></div><hr />

Now there's wishful thinking. As far as I know, &quot;Friends &amp; Family Alpha&quot; hasn't even begun (or the news about it hasn't leaked yet), and you still got closed beta testing to do (which takes several months), AND releasing the 6.0 patch to live servers (which is likely to release about a month before the expansion pack, per usual).<br />
<br />
You're looking at 6 months MINIMUM before Warlords of Draenor is released. I'd estimate closer to October/November.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The source is in History. Just looking back at the latest expansion pack (Mists of Pandaria);<br />
<br />
Announced at Blizzcon 2011 (October 21st 2011), released on September 25th 2012. Almost a full year from announcement, to release.<br />
<br />
Warlords of Draenor was announced on November 8th 2013. Now you tell me; What assumption/conclusion would one draw from this? If WoD takes as long to develop as Mists of Pandaria did, your looking at ~11 months from announcement to release. Which would be... Around October.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mileskg21</div><div class="date">2014-02-16, 06:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">they are further along with WoD than they were with MoP when they announced it</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Saber256</div><div class="date">2014-02-16, 06:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">they are further along with WoD than they were with MoP when they announced it<br />
<br />
While this is true, MoP beta was released March 21st, 2012. If WoD Beta is not released sooner than that, we could potentially see a Sept release date for WoD. Beta for an expac is not going to be less then 6 months...</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">darkthunder</div><div class="date">2014-02-16, 06:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">they are further along with WoD than they were with MoP when they announced it<br />
<br />
So they claim. We shall see. Most expansions took them 15-16 months from announcement to release, with Mists being &quot;considerably&quot; faster at 11 months. If they keep the same pace for WoD, that puts a release in October. If they are faster (around 9 months), that puts the release in August. My assumption is, certainly no release before Summer, or during the Summer months.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shudder</div><div class="date">2014-02-16, 06:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's funny because a lot of people expected the beta to start or be announced right after Blizzcon. And that we'd have a spring release. Because they said they were further along, wanted faster expacs, didn't want another DS 9 month drought and when asked about a summer release they said they wanted it before that. Now here we are, 3 months later and not one peep about beta even starting. And the icing on the pathetic cake is it's not even that much of an expansion, more like a content patch we have to pay for. No new professions, no new classes, no new races. Something like what 5 new dungeons? And it's taking them this long? How sad is this?</div></div><hr />

In all seriousness, I think I would of liked if the old mounts got a upgrade and you could of done a quest or something to obtain them after the Scroll is gone. <br />
Would be great for other people to get the mount, in which I already got them. I have the Spectral Wyvern for Horde and I have the Spectral Gryphon for Alliance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In December/January I was saying the same thing. November basically. BUT, SoO will a be year at the end of August (and Blizz admitted that a year of ICC was a mistake on their part, so why would they compound that with well over a year of SoO?) and MoP will be 2 at the end of Sept. It's hard to believe that WoD will come out after those two milestones have gone by. I've also bought into the argument that WoD likely won't need as long of a beta since there's no new race/class to balance, meaning your minimum of 6 months could be (and likely is) arguably less. <br />
<br />
If they'd just announce the beta already (I'm assuming pre-orders and paid 90s hinges on that) we could all speculate with a lot more verve! ;)</div></div><hr />

See, this doesn't tell us anything though. What matters is the % of completion when they make the announcement, and none of us has a clue on that. I can tell you, 2 days before your birthday, that I'm knitting you a scarf. When I hand you the scarf at your party can you guess how long it took me to knit it? Maybe I started it the day before I told you, maybe weeks before, maybe months before. You have no idea.</div></div><hr />

I've given up on them doing anything interesting on anniversaries anymore. Pets or mounts are a fun way to look back and say, &quot;I was there for this!&quot; - their FOSes and whatever else they've done lately - I forget, an XP bonus or something? - are not.</div></div><hr />

<br />
One thing you are forgetting is they are also implementing the Item squish, which means they need to make sure that someone in level 90 gear can still solo lower level raids and such. I imagine there has to be a lot of balancing and tuning needed to implement it well over the course of 90+ levels...</div></div><hr />

As far as I know, &quot;Friends &amp; Family Alpha&quot; hasn't even begun (or the news about it hasn't leaked yet), and you still got closed beta testing to do (which takes several months), AND releasing the 6.0 patch to live servers (which is likely to release about a month before the expansion pack, per usual).<br />
<br />
You're looking at 6 months MINIMUM before Warlords of Draenor is released. I'd estimate closer to October/November.<br />
<br />
They don't do F&amp;F alpha anymore. Didn't with MoP either. WoD will release 4-6 months from the beta being available unless something really odd happens. Thus, as it has been for months, the question is when beta starts.</div></div><hr />

But the people who weren't willing to come back for a free 80 (when it was max or close to max level) aren't going to come back for a level 90 that they have to pay for, while at the same time you're &quot;losing&quot; potential returning players who might have been tempted by a free SoR 90. <br />
<br />
The only way it would make sense is if they didn't want someone to be able to get an SoR, get a free level 80/90, then upgrade to WoD and get a &quot;free&quot; level 90 as well. Because if they're selling 90's in the store they'd want that player to pay for his second raised character.... are subscription numbers really so great that they can be that greedy about things? Who gives a shit if someone gets an &quot;extra&quot; level 80/90 as long as it increases the number of subscriptions and active players?</div></div><hr />

<br />
All they are doing is replacing the free 80 with a free 90 which applies to everyone, not just veterans. Nothing about that has to do with a reasoning of making the second character cost and being greedy.</div></div><hr />

The patch was never about the boost. Notice it's not even mentioned in the patch notes. The new PvP season and getting ready for the preorders and the pre-expansion patch is why they are doing 5.4.7</div></div><hr />

What about Blizzcon 2014? No announced dates yet, but surely with the 20th/10th anniversaries they have to have one, right? Blizz basically looses a month in preparation for the show since they run it themselves, so how does that play into the speculation? I don't see them having one in August if they're working so hard on WoD, and Oct/Nov is possible but only if WoD has been released by then (the stage being set for announcement of the next expansion maybe?). Do you think they'll have Blizzcon this year? If so, how is that playing into your timeline?<br />
I doubt there will be a Blizzcon. There's nothing to announce and even the milestone anniversaries most likely wouldn't justify holding one.<br />

I wish there was just a little bit more to this patch for the PvE side. Guess we'll see what comes up in the future though.<br />

Just because something is included in the PTR does not mean that is the main focus of the patch. Or that it is even something that is intended to go live with the patch. The PTR is Blizzard's test server. They put things in there all the time that either never actually go live, or aren't going in with the rest of the patch that is on the PTR. In this case, I fully understand that tech necessary to make the level 90 boost work is included so that it is ready when they decide to make it active. But that in no way means it is the main point of the patch. <br />
<br />
My point was that the level 90 boosts are not mentioned at all in the official patch notes, so there is no way to think that it is the main point of the patch. If that was intended to be the main point of this patch, do you not think that feature would be at least mentioned? The main reason for the patch is the new PvP season. Blizzard is just using this opportunity to get everything for the level 90 boost ready, and there is no reason to expect it to go live with the patch. It will almost certainly be turned on a later date.</div></div><hr />

An April beta is possible but unlikely I think. Probably be around May/June. I was laughing at the June/July release and &quot;new Blizzard&quot;. Blizzard is evolving but in the wrong direction. They are getting more and more greedy and we get less and less content. Blizzard has been saying for years that expansions are going to be released more quickly and they never are.

Look at the patch notes again dude, it mentions character upgrades multiple times meaning it features the level 90 boost. Plus its on the PTR, a feature that big would only be released once the patch is up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You are the one that needs to read more carefully. There are stings datamined from the patch that are obviously part of the upgrade feature. But the actual patch notes do not say anything about it. Even the news post these comments are attached to says that it may not be going live with the patch. <br />
<br />
PTR Patch Notes (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/blog/12592415/547-ptr-patch-notes-february-11-2-11-2014)<br />
<br />
I never said that the setup necessary for the level 90 boost was not included. Just that the boost itself is a separate feature not directly related to the patch, will very likely not be enabled at the same time the patch goes live on Tuesday, and was never meant to be a &quot;main point&quot; of this patch. Blizzard is using it to put in behind-the-scenes tech that will be necessary for them to activate the feature at a later date. But there is absolutely no reason at this time to believe that we will be seeing this live any time soon and certainly not on Tuesday.</div></div><hr />

You do realize that Blizz has said they &quot;want&quot; to make an expac a year since 2007 right? And it has never happened, won't happen this time. What on gods green earth makes you think it would release this summer? All the content they have released showing us how far along they are? The beta that hasn't happened yet? The character models that are 30% done the garrisons which are, at best, halfway done?<br />
<br />
His opinion is valid so why do you have to take the low road and be a jerk in every one of your replies? Please tell me you aren't basing your opinion on what Blizzard hasn't shown us. For all we know, everything is done and they are simply prepping for beta.<br />
<br />
<br />
If Boub is correct and we see the beta pop in Feb/March, release could be anywhere from June (assuming they do get the expansion out quicker) to September (assuming a full 6 month beta). I'd lean more toward a June/July/early August release but you never know.</div></div><hr />

This made me laugh way too hard, and then I cried a little. As milking as much money out of the playerbase as they can, seems to be their #1 priority these days.</div></div><hr />

Some time later....<br />

&quot;We will add another PvP season, that literally adds nothing new to the game&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
Some minor tweaks that could have been hotfixed/server restart day, PvP season ending... and new one starting - big frikkin deal......<br />
<br />
In the 9+ years of this game I don't think I've ever seen such an underwhelming patch. More content, more often? lol... such bs. Ever start to feel you are being milked/taken the piss out of?<br />
<br />
From a development PoV even the 90 char boost is already in game with the scroll of resurrection coding. All they are doing is adding some minor bells &amp; whistles and increasing the level from 80 to 90 to SoR and making this the 'level 90 boost' feature - you think it is just a coincidence that SoR is 'retiring'? It is being re-purposed to make moolah.<br />
<br />
We're a casual 25m guild on a low pop realm, 11/14hc, Just soon as we clear 14/14hc (I don't want to let my in game friends down), I think I'll be cancelling my sub until WoD, if I do even actually come back.</div></div><hr />

I'm just guessing, but i think this patch was so underwhelming because they are focusing so much on get the possible beta pushed out and WoD released asap:).</div></div><hr />

And that we'd have a spring release. Because they said they were further along, wanted faster expacs, didn't want another DS 9 month drought and when asked about a summer release they said they wanted it before that. Now here we are, 3 months later and not one peep about beta even starting. And the icing on the pathetic cake is it's not even that much of an expansion, more like a content patch we have to pay for. No new professions, no new classes, no new races. Something like what 5 new dungeons? And it's taking them this long? How sad is this?<br />
<br />
Perhaps its time to move on to a real MMO? Blizzards own developers are disgusted with what they did to the genre. Try FFXIV. Extremely successful, has most of the crutches and training wheels wow provides, but the group content is much more difficult and much better tuned. (which is saying quite a bit)<br />
<br />
Should hold you over until Pantheon: Rise of the Fallen, the first true MMO since Everquest/FFXI. Cant come soon enough.<br />
