Though, it will probably be a lot cheaper, but thats a good thing. I hope beasts in Tanaan will drop savage blood or something, because if you are farming just for Felblood, no one will ever have savage making the prices skyrocket. Just thought of that. Hopefully blood will drop from beasts or skinning.</div></div><hr />

Raid tokens are different and I would fully expect teem to change so that example doesn't realyl work. But when the first 4 stages of crafting have been one item from &quot;tough&quot; elites, why change it for the last upgrade?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because it always happens, there's always been a new crafting reagent for every new tier. The most recent was MoP, which had a different crafting reagant every tier, if you've forgotten. HM and BRF are both Tier 17 and the crafted items appropriate for that use Savage Blood. Hellfire Citadel is tier 18, so it's felblood. If there's a tier 19 in WoD, it'll be Shadowblood, or Iron Blood or whatever. This isn't a new thing. WoTLK had Frozen Orb, Runed Orb, Crusader Orb and Primordial Saronite. Cataclysm had some stuff with Essence of Destruction being the final one. Mists was Primal Spirit/Blood Spirit for Preraid/T1, Haunting Spirit for T2 and Spirit of War/Balanced Trillium for T3.</div></div><hr />

Yes and no. The first patch notes they nerfed us hard. Now they are realizing that the nerfs were too much and reverting them. It looks like buffs, but in reality, all those abilities are 5%weaker than they are on live.</div></div><hr />

Different mechanic. They've never added a new crafting reagent like this, mid expansion, that I can recall. Bonus roll currency is a completely different issue.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thats not how that works. Its 20 yards around the activater. So some respected melee in your guild.</div></div><hr />

why should last 2 upgrades cost nothing because people have 3+ months to farm savage bloods? <br />

Because they don't want people strutting around with their 715 (higher than heroic) gear on day 1 of 6.2? It's a pretty common exercise really.</div></div><hr />

<br />
basically this is due to gems being a static upgrade, while warforged is an exponential<br />
<br />
just doing some simplified math (stats x 0.06) on mythic legs shows that you get 24 int + 32 secondaries. Which is roughly 80 points, thus higher than what you'd get from an epic gem, imagine this compared to a blue gem, it would be almost twice as good, thus people would not really enjoy getting sockets as much, for the expensive items I would say gems and warforged is pretty much the same, but for cheaper items like shoulders, wrists and such sockets is a bit above, while for items like trinkets and weapons wf will be better. Obviously getting both would be the best, but getting both is not something you reliably can get on every piece.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Mandatory barns for all professions on one or more toons unless you have a ton of gold, just like it's been since the start of the expansion. At least if you want to make money.<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyone know how this Felblood will work? Do you get it from any Elite Mobs like Savage Blood? or do you have to catch new Tanaan Mobs for it? Can you buy it with Primal Spirit? Any clues? I would like to be prepared as good as i can.<br />
<br />
<br />
I think it's pretty safe to assume it's from Tanaan, considering it's fel blood and Tanaan is very fel corrupted. Primal Spirits, I've got no diea.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A small note about the old upgrades - I wasn't playing so I'm not sure if this is already true on the live servers, but savage blood at the trader is now 25 primal spirits, down from 50, and the essences, like the Truesteel essence, instead of saying &quot;Will upgrade from level 640 to 655, is now a flat &quot;Will raise weapon ilvl up 15 levels, up to 685&quot;. Which makes alts and catch up easier. So now you don't need different levels of essences, just the one. Same for the armor, too. <br />
<br />
It's stuff like that, that trigger interest for me.</div></div><hr />

Where will the &quot;new&quot; ilevels be around with the new raid gear? I'd think around 680 for lfr and 690 normal 700 heroic 710 mythic? Seems a little weak to me tho, but was just by looking at the legendary rings. Hopefully higher so it actually feels like you're progressing.<br />
<br />
We don't know lfr yet for sure, but we do know its 695 for normal, 710 for heroic, and 725 for mythic. Seems to reason that lfr is 680, though id prefer it being 675.</div></div><hr />
