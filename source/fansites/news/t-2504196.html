Queen Azshara Hotfixes this Week<br />
We’re working on the following hotfixes today. We intend to apply to these changes to the Queen Azshara encounter with weekly maintenance in each region:<br />
<br />
<br />
When either Aethenel or Cyranus is slain on Normal, Heroic, or Mythic difficulty, there is now a 3-second delay before the other one gains the Torment buff.<br />
Azshara’s Indomitable is now summoned 10 seconds later than previously observed on Mythic difficulty.<br />
Tidemistresses have 5% less health on Mythic difficulty.<br />
Ancient Wards now energize slightly slower for smaller raid sizes on Normal and Heroic difficulties.<br />
Fixed an issue that allowed Arcane Vulnerability to apply when the victim wasn’t in line of sight of Queen Azshara.<br />
<br />
<br />
We’ll update this post if there are any further changes, and when the hotfixes go live.<br />
<br />
<br />
Season 3 Artifact Knowledge<br />
<br />
Is this being cut off soon?<br />
Or are you leaving it on indefinitely?<br />
<br />
No to both questions. <br />
<br />
As things currently stand, Artifact Knowledge will continue to increase each week until the week of October 1.</div></div><hr />

Artifact Knowledge is what the catch-up mechanic for artifact-type equipment is known as. So it applies equally to the Heart of Azeroth, not just the Legion weapons.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Lovely and confusion. But then again, Azerite Power = Artifact Power, so they might as well re-use the naming :P</div></div><hr />

Heart of Azeroth is an artifact quality item. So it makes sense.</div></div><hr />

Alts are alts for a reason. <br />
<br />

Yah, but all the resources, time etc is kinda wasted when you will get to 58+ with 1 Ap emissary in 2 months. It's probably way more efficient to do M10 on them every week than to do any emissary with AP or IE. ilvl value decays slower than AP.</div></div><hr />

You guys are slow as hell getting them up on Tuesday's these days. The old owners used to have them up by like 930am.</div></div><hr />

I didnt farm any ap at all on these guys. As i said i couldnt care less about ap. All gear, all progression simply everything will be lost in the next xpac, let alone the next patch.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Of course, I am sure everyone is aware of that or they wouldn't play. All I am saying is that if you like to maximize your time (which is valuable, it is finite) it is obviously better to wait for AP to drop before maximizing the performance of your alts.</div></div><hr />
