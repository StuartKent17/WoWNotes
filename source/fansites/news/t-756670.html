Downranking<br />
The problem with downranking that we hated, and the reason we killed it, wasn't because players were being clever by using cheaper heals when they needed a smaller heal. That's good gameplay and the kind of thing the new model should reward. The part of downranking that was broken, was that the coefficients matter so much more than the base points that you could maintain mana forever by casting a heal that was only slightly less effective. That wasn't gaming the numbers. That was breaking them. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26725672943/lvl85-h-paladin-numbers-abilities-thread/))<br />

Healing as ... retribution<br />
I said holy gear in a ret spec. And why would the heals be small? In a raid environment, the ret spec could have as much as 2000 more sp than a similarly geared holy paladin because of Sheath of Light and various buffs to AP. This alone would show how little scaling of healing spells the holy tree provides. <br />
We'll look into it and make sure it's not viable. We've certainly had cases in the past where the conversion factors that let Ret not be terrible at healing look really attractive to someone actually wearing healing gear.

Heroic Leap<br />
This ability has a lot of history because we tried it once before. For the Cataclysm version, we received a lot of feedback originally that Heroic Leap just didn't distinguish itself enough from Charge etc. any more. This is a world with Juggernaut and Warbringer after all. We discussed that feedback and understood where warriors were coming from, so we redesigned it so that players could choose where they would leap to. We think the current implementation has lot of different uses. No, it can't get you over canyons or up to ledges, but how often will those case legitimately arise? The potential exploits were the ability that unfettered would be enormous, and reducing those is what let us offer Heoic Leap as it is in the first place. It's a useful ability now. We can experiment with visual effect and height and that sort of thing. I understand from reading this thread that there are players who would design a different ability were they in our shoes. That's fine. This is a subjective business. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26560867318/new-warrior-discussion-build-12857/))<br />

Slam<br />
Slam is a controversial ability for sure, but we know there are Arms warriors who considered the height of skill of their class to be when they had to line up the Slam swing time in between their Mortal Strikes. It's not for everyone, for sure, but with Improved Slam and Bloodsurge and being able to move, it really isn't asking too much of you. Yeah you'll screw it up sometimes, but it won't be a catastrophic dps loss when you do.<br />
<br />
We've seen just a ton of feedback in the past few weeks on lots of different abilities for different classes that essentially comes down to &quot;X is too hard to use.&quot; We think overall that WoW's combat is pretty forgiving. We really don't think this is the time where we need to be making everything much harder to screw up. Simple is good. Confusing is bad. But abilities or rotations that are challenging are good for the game to a point. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26560867318/new-warrior-discussion-build-12857/))<br />

Partly... they get rid of it on every slot EXCEPT for weapons. Because they would otherwise have to put a shitload of Int on those, which would result in too big manapools.<br />
AND they want casters to enjoy a weapon-upgrade nearly as much as melee... not *meh, 50 SP more*, but more like &quot;woohoo, new weapon!&quot;, which is why they said they'd put quite a lot of SP on our weapons.</div></div><hr />

The high amounts of spellpower on weapons does not come from the item stats budged, its a substitute for weapon dps (you might notice that caster-weapons have far lower weapon dps).<br />
<br />
For melee dps, the weapon is the most important slot because of the weapons dps. It makes it very important for a melee to have an up to date weapon since a good weapon increases damage more than updating any other slot of gear could.<br />
<br />
weapon-dps substitute spellpower is there to make sure casters also get a big increase in damage by switching to a higher level weapon. The weapon's item level is supposed to increase the players action's raw power. If it was int instead of spellpower, it would also greatly increase mana and thus make it crucial for healers to have the highest level weapon available.</div></div><hr />

Strength one handers are for Frost DKs and Fury Warriors who specced into Single minded fury instead of titan's grip. Blizzard confirmed this months ago.<br />

Got into the Beta and the controls and UI really ruined it for me. Graphics look really nice, especially the characters, but the game is extremly confusing for new players. You get little to no guidance and navigating the world is a lot of guesswork...<br />

Tried to start 2 characters and then decided this sh*t is not worth my time and uninstalled the game.</div></div><hr />

My brother is in the beta and it's not that you get 8 hours a week to level. You get 8 hours to level a job of your choice and gain xp. But then you can switch a job. For every hour you put into your new job, you get 30 minutes back from your first job. So after 8 hours of job 1, then switch to mining for 8 hours, you get 4 hours more of your original job to play. If you played non-stop and kept switching jobs, you would be able to level one to max.<br />
<br />
I don't know if that's exactly how it works, but it's something like that.</div></div><hr />

You get 8 hours of 100% exp, every hour after that reduces the amount of exp you gain until the percent is 0. No that is not 8 hours straight, the way it is, is that its actually a exp cap. Say there was no restrictions and you can gain say 15k exp in an 8 hour period grind fest, the way you gain exp in FFXIV is say you constantly kill stuff none stop you will see a reduced exp gain since your killing fast getting closer to the cap. If you say kill something every 5 to 10 mins you will get more exp then if you killed none stop. So once you reach the 8 hour exp cap you will start to get a reduced base exp for every hour.<br />
<br />
Now to counter this after the 8 hour exp cap is reached you switch class to something and start lvling, you will gain 30 mins of surplus exp for every hour cap reached on another job. So say you reach the 8 hour exp cap on Lancer then switch to Pugilist and reach the 8 hour exp cap on that you will then receive a 4 hour surplus bonus to Lancer. After that say you switch to Gladiator get to the 8 hour exp cap, you will then have a 4 hour surplus bonus that you can use for either Lancer or Pugilist. The exp cap timer does not tick unless you are in combat, if you are just running around exploring the time does not reduce at all. So the MMO Report is incorrect when it says you only get 15 hours a week of exp, you get 225 hours a week of exp that's 15 hours per class and there are 15 classes. Now SE has stated they have a plan for those who reach the exp cap on all 15 classes within a week but have yet to say what it is.<br />
<br />
So just because you reach the exp cap on 1 class doesn't mean you cant do anything cause you will have 14 other classes to play with.</div></div><hr />

megiechan being forced to switch classes does not in any way make it ok. It is not a &quot;counter&quot;. It's a terrible PoS system that will crash and burn the title. Imagine if Blizzard forced you to log into other classes after X hours per week. People choose a class and like a class and stick with a class, switching to their alts when they are done with their main, because they choose to...not the game.<br />

How does high weapon damage equate to a lot of burst? And replacing level 80 gear at max level 83 is a good thing. It means that we'll actually need to do heroics before even attempting raids. No leveling to cap in old gear and facerolling the raid content only to be bored for 6 months. WotLK was a massive mistake.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Agreed, for the first part anyway.<br />
<br />
Old gear is old, and should be replaced ASAP. It's had its time and place.<br />
<br />
Also, as you can see from the massive stamina upgrades in all item types, I really doubt that people would die in seconds a la WOTLK style.<br />
If a level 83 blue chest has 401 stamina, imagine how much would the first pvp tier chest have?</div></div><hr />

Get over it. A waste of legendary ? You used it for a while in ICC and topped metters with it, right ? Also Arena +2k2 facerolling, maybe ? How is that a waste ?

Uh, no, that is not how it works at all. Where you people get this &quot;get an hour back after 30 minutes&quot; or &quot;30 minutes back after an hour&quot; bit are completely wrong.<br />
<br />
Square-Enix has decided a baseline of experience you are determined to achieve. That amount is *BASED* on their average amount of experience gained across 8 hours of combat playtime. Once that is achieved, you then progress towards 0% experience based on an additional 7 hours of gameplay. It isn't 15 realtime hours; people that level slowly (aka molasses) will do it in more time, but the normal play that plays one class they like will find themselves with nothing to do within 2 days of the week. The &quot;time&quot; that people report getting back some time to experience is randomly decided when they log off or on after a day -- some people in beta are getting maybe 30 minutes worth of more, some get surplus immediately when they begin trying to experience again.<br />
<br />
Anyone justifying this type of fatigue system is a moron. It is a PUNISHMENT for playing a class that you like. It isn't to &quot;level the playing field between hardcore and casual players&quot; and any idiot seriously believing that lie should contact me as I have a fucking condo on Mars I want to sell you (great view, I swear). The sad thing is, SE FanTards will suck on the company's nutsack and swallow down any bullshit story they're told and believe it. Hint: Instead of giving a boost to casuals to suit their playstyle, they decided to punish everyone. And yeah, the whole Guildeve (questing) system they put into play that they stated the game was to revolve around -- you get 8 quests per 48 hours. Then you go grind. Oh sure, you can basically leech some points and cash from &quot;helping&quot; someone else do their quests after you're finished (basically, leeching a chance at a holiday mount in the old WoW system after your daily run is done), and the SE FanTards are fine with a system that promotes complete douchebaggery.<br />
<br />
The system is nothing more than an utter cockblock to players because SE has zero endgame due to the game being in testing for less than 3 months. Yes, less than 3 months. They KNOW there will be nothing to do, yet they need money, so they decided on this method opposed to saying &quot;Level cap is 15 starting off. We'll raise it by 5 every 2 weeks after that until we reach the intended level of 50.&quot;<br />
<br />
But hey, fatigue system aside, it's 2010 and the company can't even program a serious Mouse + Keyboard control scheme. That's the biggest telling of how they'll handle everything else.</div></div><hr />

Also, I wouldn't unequip a weaponthat provides almost 600 strength (considering Cata sockets) for one that provides like 200.

I don't get this preoccupation of &quot;EPIX MUST BE SPECIAL!&quot; Because what? Bigger epeen? I mean really why does it matter? In WotLK The Black Heart a NONE heroic drop is one of the best trinkets before ICC. I've seen tanks get called noobs/scrubs/ect because &quot;zomg its lvl 200!&quot; so now some fantastic stuff is going to be blue and you're going to get &quot;WTT GTFO SCRUB ITS BLUE!&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
Heroics being heroics, all the (good) loot from those will probably be &quot;requires lvl85&quot;, and be about as good as entry-level epics. And raids being raids, most loot in those will be epics, but little better than blues. <br />
<br />
But, there will only be about 10 raid boss encounters at launch by the looks of things. Wrath meanwhile had 15 bosses in Naxx, and then 3 more in the form of OS, Maly and VoA. Most of those were faceroll. What's more, there were 2 sets of lock-out timers for 10 and 25, which there won't be this time. Anyway, the point is that there'll probably be less loot per week this time. So the loot from 5-man hc's will be more important.<br />
<br />
Based on the professions and current loot lists: (subject to change, etc)<br />
Current BiS gear lvl : 260 - 284<br />
lvl 80 greens/ blues: 298 - 308<br />
lvl 81 : 316<br />
lvl 82 : 325<br />
lvl 83 : 333<br />

<br />
142 weapon dps, a 600 damage higher topend, and 178 mastery/haste instead of 114 crit/haste in the hammers favor, while Shadowmourne has about 400 more strength with the Chaos Bane proc and 3 +67 strength gems . And while 800 attack power sounds like a lot, it does not beat the raw 142 weapon dps/600 higher topend. Hammer is better, take off your color coded glasses of &quot;Blue = shit&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Tried to start 2 characters and then decided this sh*t is not worth my time and uninstalled the game.<br />

No offense mate, really, but you're probably just so accustomed to Warcraft holding your hand every step of the way that having to think about what you need to do next seems tedious. Anybody who's played Warcraft for a long time without already having played games like EQ or FFXI are going to have a pretty steep learning curve whenever they transition to a real MMORPG.</div></div><hr />

<br />
On everything except weapons. Was mentioned in blue posts multiple times. You're supposed to get your biggest DPS boost from weapons anyways, so it makes sense. :)<br />
<br />
And I've read many opinions and descriptions on the FFXIV experience system, and the only thing that I can cohesively glean from it is that it's dragging up by the nose and smacking in the face anyone who would devote hours of play to a single type of class/character.... which is pretty much anyone who would play FFXIV.<br />
<br />
So I really gotta wonder why people allow companies to abuse their trust and patronage like this.</div></div><hr />

Gemming is still in cataclysm.<br />
<br />
The items listed are level 83 leveling stuff. Not a lot of level 76, 77 or 78 gear had sockets. Very few quest rewards in wrath had sockets.</div></div><hr />

If I look at those stats I become seriously depressed. Not because of the high numbers, but because they are sooo boring. I miss items with a wide variety of stats like hit, crit, haste and armor penetration.<br />
<br />
Especially the tank trinket,... come on how is just 252 dodge rating exciting? Looking at these items and stats I don't feel at all like &quot;yes, I want to upgrade my items!&quot;, or &quot;yes, I want to farm instances for these items!&quot; (a feeling which I had when TBC and Wotlk came out).</div></div><hr />

<br />
What I found exciting is essence of gossamer. A bunch of stamina and a fun proc effect. Same with the Black Heart, etc. Or nice Use: effects, like the Corroded Skeleton Key. Now &quot;just&quot; 252 dodge rating isn't really that exciting. And remember, while the number looks high, it probably is no more than about 3-5% dodge *at most* at level 85.</div></div><hr />

However these would potentially be awesome +Hit caster cloaks for both Moonkin and Elemental shammies. Even the +mana feature on the trinkets is hard to pigeonhole as healer in Cata it seems, since mana will be more of an issue for offensive specs as well.<br />
<br />
So yeah, apart from actual Cloth items, I don't think you can take +spirit to mean 'healer'?<br />
<br />
Edit: Same applies to rings.<br />
<br />
I tought they were making spirit once again main mana ressource and were getting rid of mana per 5 rule, except for procs or on use. They have also removed any talent that made spirit worth for casters...and this will make me get rid of all my lock epics from lvl81.<br />

But it's a lvl83 trinket, and blue for what it matters...meaning epic one is probably have more dodge rating and probably +stam or on use/proc effect.</div></div><hr />

<br />
blizz said healers will have way more mana problems than dps who use mana. all dps specs that use mana have talents to keep their mana up while dpsing<br />
<br />
Blizzard has said time and time again that offensive casters should NOT be worrying about mana. They have said that if they are worrying about mana then they will make adjustments to the classes themselves. They have no intention for casters to use mana regeneration type items.</div></div><hr />
