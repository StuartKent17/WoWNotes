The launch of Rise of Azshara will mark the end of Battle for Azeroth Season 2. On launch day (date to-be-announced soon), both PvP and Mythic Keystone competition will close, and a two-week off-season for those activities will begin.<br />
<br />
During the off-season, Mythic Keystone dungeons will still be playable using Season 2 affixes and rewards, but their seasonal achievements will no longer be available. Additionally, it will still be possible to queue for Rated PvP and earn based on your Season 2 rating, but seasonal rewards and titles will no longer be earnable. The end-of-season rankings will close when Rise of Azshara goes live.<br />
<br />
As always, we ask that competitive players refrain from transferring character(s) to another realm or faction until after BFA Season 3 has begun.<br />
<br />
BFA Season 3 will begin two weeks after the content update, along with the opening of Azshara’s Eternal Palace, the new Operation: Mechagon dungeon, a new seasonal affix for Mythic Keystone dungeons, and the availability of higher item-level Azerite gear.<br />
<br />
Additionally, Battle of Dazar’alor and Crucible of the Storm raid achievements such as Ahead of the Curve and Cutting Edge will be obtainable throughout the off-season. You can continue to earn both of them right up until Azshara’s Eternal Palace opens.<br />
<br />
Now get out there and fight to the finish!</div></div><hr />

Not sure how much clearer this can be.<br />
<br />
Additionally, Battle of Dazar’alor and Crucible of the Storm raid achievements such as Ahead of the Curve and Cutting Edge will be obtainable throughout the off-season. You can continue to earn both of them right up until Azshara’s Eternal Palace opens.<br />
<br />
When the new raid opens, they will no longer be obtainable. UNTIL the new raid opens, they will still be obtainable. Which is not only expected, but the exact same way Cutting Edge and Ahead of the Curve have always been.<br />
<br />

What's the confusion?The confusion is from ToV, which was pretty much the same thing as CoS, being handled differently and Helya's Cutting Edge being available throughout Nighthold. <br />
<br />
There's also Hall of Fame, which currently has 10 Alliance Uu'nat kills. There's zero chance of that number reaching 100 unless there are absolutely crushing nerfs being released within next week or two.<br />
<br />
Also, that statement doesn't explicitly says that CoS CE will be gone. &quot;You can continue to earn both until Eternal Palace opens&quot; could mean that both will be removed or just BDA. It is not clear.</div></div><hr />

They should have pulled a Helya and made it available until 8.3, at or least 8.2.5. Unless the place gets hit by truly absurd nerfbats (and I mean things like 30% less boss HP and damage), I don't see more than 150, maybe 200 guilds killing the boss.</div></div><hr />

Sure, the ratio is probably less skewed the lower you go, but still, even 4:1 means well over 400 kills just to fill the Hall of Fame. From less than one hundred at the moment. It's either Sunwell 2.0 scenario (massive nerfs), keeping the achievement active throught Eternal Palace or completely shitting on their new &quot;feature&quot;... and Alliance guilds.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This was realistically never the case for active players. The only reason you ever ran older raids was to equip new players (and at this point you would still just run Dazar'alor since thats on farm), or to do attunments - again for new players. Active players will eventually just deck out on a raid and have no reason to go back - this was the same in all history of WoW.<br />
<br />
You may get gear faster now and replace old raid gear more quickly, however the 6 months a typical tier lasts would be plenty to get a full set of gear from any raid, even if you cut the drop chance in half from live today.<br />
<br />
Afterall, I did Uldir for months and months, why should I even want to do it even longer, instead of doing the new raid?<br />
After 6 months of Dazar'alor, that place is really &quot;done&quot; and relatively boring. I rather spent future raid hours in Azsharas Palace instead of going back to this &quot;done&quot; raid again and again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
THey're comparing Nighthold with Azshara though. That's the big problem. Azshara's palace is the ToS of BFA which means that it's still the right position to remove the achievements of Cutting Edge/AotC for said raid</div></div><hr />

Looking at my server and extrapolating from there, nobody cares. Out of 20 guilds that finished BODA only 1 even killed a boss in mythic COS and even they went back last week to refarming BODA for mounts instead of attempting Uunat. <br />

The raid is just flat too hard.<br />

A mount or some sweet drop would help, but at the end of the day stupid hard raids isn't something even serious raiders want.</div></div><hr />

The Essences coming with 8.2 will buff everyone, so that should at least give them 2 weeks or so in which they can try doing them with quite significant character buffs. Just need to work on getting a bunch of early essences fast.</div></div><hr />

This is not true.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
People do want challenging raids. CoS was just horribly timed. Usually after progression (most) guilds do a casual 1 night raid schedule for X number of months until the next raid. Adding in a 2 boss filler raid that was so extremely difficult so soon after Mythic Jaina progress was the mistake. That is how you get player burn out. Add in the fact that most of the gear is awful and as you said, no mount. There is very little incentive forcing your raid team to clear CoS so near to the launch of Palace.<br />
<br />
<br />
If CoS was a real raid tier with 8+ bosses and Uu'nat as the final boss, guilds would have been pushing it as usual.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KaPe</div><div class="date">2019-06-06, 01:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is not true.<br />

<br />
If CoS was a real raid tier with 8+ bosses and Uu'nat as the final boss, guilds would have been pushing it as usual.This doesn't negate his point. It's too hard for the time it was released in. It provides a challenge to fully geared characters, without any way to nerf itself over time. The rewards are largely sidegrades and will be made useless once 8.2 raid goes live. First boss is just slightly easier than Jaina and second one is far more challenging.<br />
<br />
It really is the repeat of ToV, except I really don't see the reason of removing Cutting Edge. Nighthold had its' own &quot;essences&quot; in the form of additional artifact traits. Somehow, this didn't require removing of Helya's achievement and she was still harder than half of mythic Nighthold.<br />
<br />
Either way, it's a baffling decision. Essences must be overpowered as hell if they're supposed to result in few hundred of Uu'nat kills in merely two weeks. Not including the time it takes to farm them. Or being unable to get the ones people might prefer, because they're gated in some way. Or not having rank 3 for maximum effect. Or the boss having instant wipe mechanics that aren't completely trivialized by somewhat higher dps. <br />
<br />
Also, why even introduce Hall of Fame if you're not going to care about the Alliance side? Why create a raid that's becoming obsolete after mere 3 months? What a joke.</div></div><hr />

Yes and no. It won't release July 4, Blizz avoid releasing stuff around their holidays. But 25th June for 8.2 and 9th July for S3 are very, very likely.</div></div><hr />

Nah, old raid, throw it in the bin!<br />
<br />
Why would I want to? at least in my case, I was in uldir for months and got tired of it, then BOD came and I loved it and yesterday we killed jaina in HC (yes I know me and my guildmates are bad), I'm still not Tired of BOD, but I guess in 3 weeks I'll start craving for that sweet new raid.<br />
<br />
I like that my guild doesn't have to farm 2 or 3 raids to go to another one just because there are 2 new undergeared guys, specially farming raids we've spend months on.<br />
<br />
I understand why people like it the way you do, But I certainly don't, I dont want to grind a raid that I've spend months on again and again and again.</div></div><hr />

Last wave of nerfs few weeks ago made Jaina much easier and she drops a mount, I wouldn't expect any guild progressing Jaina or one that killed her skip BODA for COS for any reason. <br />
<br />
COS had potential if it either: <br />
- was released earlier and was tuned around lower ilvl so guilds could slightly outgear it over time while bleeding edge ones would beat it for bragging rights early on (atm it was released tuned around full max BODA mythic gear) <br />
- was released as an easier &quot;filler&quot; raid giving something to do for the guilds stuck at Jaina, giving extra gear boost (that required the raid to be easier than Jaina, yes Method would kill it in a day but for every &quot;Method&quot; out there there's 100 guilds that raid 2 times a week don't use alts and have less skill / coordination, still they wanna enjoy content) <br />
- had unique rewards like TOV transmog sets <br />
<br />
COS adds to long list of BFA content that fell flat and ended up being a waste of dev resources. Island expeditions are also on that list, yet they keep adding them every patch, and buffing the AP from them in a desperate attempt to make more people actually participate in these. Compare that to Legion and how many people enjoyed for example Mage Tower challenges for weapon skins.</div></div><hr />

I’ll give an example on how that works and gives incentives to keep going. Since there’s so little that interests me in BfA I’ve been spending non raid nights elsewhere. ESO specifically. There the entire world scales. You can literally start questing in whatever zone you wish. On top of that so do all of the instances. And the gear they provide. Yesterday I ran 2 old vet trials just for the fun of it. And it’s still challenging even though they’re old trials. And I got some really good gear out of my efforts. I can also stash what that character couldn’t use for another character similar to how Diablo works. The gear isn’t linear. I can choose the set in game that I want for that toon and and do as I please. There really isn’t a BIS, if there is the difference is so minimal no one actually cares. And while not recommended a low level could have joined us if we’d been running normal. Only vet mode is locked to level cap. <br />
<br />
Blizzard started on this path with level scaling. Where they failed was limiting it so much. Time walking raids prove they can do it, they just didn’t bother to make the rewards relevant. There’s so many raids in the game that could be made relevant again if they only wanted to try. It would up so many options for people. Because here’s the kicker on what such a system does. We ran old trials last night. I’ve run the new one that’s only 2 weeks old last weekend, but we weren’t pigeon holed into only running that. We still wanted to run the old one. Aside from mount &amp; Transmog WoW’s old content just fades into oblivion once it’s replaced. That’s the difference with a linear &amp; non linear system. And non linear is so much more motivating to go run something old since the rewards are still relevant.</div></div><hr />

You are talking about something a bit different, I certainly would not mind if all the dungeons and raids scaled every season so you always have a big closet to choose what to take today. But that's different from what the guy I quoted said, that to raid in BOD you MUST raid and get gear first in Uldir, that's underwhelming for me, specially because in my guild we are changing constantly.<br />
<br />
About all world scaling, I love it, but at the same time miss to go back to a zone and explode everything because I'm more powerful now, I have mixed feelings that are resolved with how they have the system today, it could be better tho.</div></div><hr />
