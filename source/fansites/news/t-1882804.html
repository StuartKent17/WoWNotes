<br />
The Grammy Award–winning rock band—and the biggest band on Facebook, with 63 million fans and counting—will be taking the stage the evening of Saturday, November 7, to provide an epic send-off for everyone at this year’s convention. Even if you didn’t score tickets to the show, Blizzard gamers and Linkin Park fans around the world can still get a front-row seat from home with the BlizzCon Virtual Ticket (http://bit.ly/BlizzconVT).<br />
<br />
BlizzCon is the biggest Blizzard party of the year, packed with in-depth developer panels, intense eSports tournaments, the legendary Friday night contests—this year hosted by Wil Wheaton—and what’s sure to be an epic finale from Linkin Park. The Virtual Ticket lets you watch it all online, live and in high definition. Order a Virtual Ticket and you’ll also receive a treasure trove of in-game goodies (http://us.battle.net/blizzcon/en/blog/19888091/blizzcon-2015-in-game-goodies-round-up-9-21-2015) for World of Warcraft, StarCraft II, Diablo III, Hearthstone, and Heroes of the Storm.<br />
<br />
Check out the press release (http://blizzard.gamespress.com/LINKIN-PARK-TO-BRING-DOWN-THE-HOUSE-AT-BLIZZCON-2015) for more information on this year’s closing concert featuring Linkin Park. We’ll see you at the show!</div></div><hr />

I think you completely misinterpreted the intention of my post. I'm simply pointing out to Blizzcon attendees that there are plenty of other things to do at Blizzcon, i.e.: everything besides this little concert. And with such a large and diverse playerbase, not everyone is going to like the band. In short, people should stop bitching.</div></div><hr />

Honestly MMO champion, kind of done reading the comments about the live band every year. They could just ....y'know, not bother. Get some no namers to do it for 1/100th the price.</div></div><hr />

IKR! Hard to believe that every one of those bands in the 2001 concert eventually became a headliner. Slipknot's #3 (Chris Fehn) Climbed up on the scaffolding and dove into the crowd during their set, he landed right in front of a buddy and I.<br />
<br />

Last time I heared something about LP was that they said they dont like playing their old songs (first album) because they feel like they moved on and don't cater to those fans. (something like that).<br />

Regardless, only their first album was really good, the rest was just bad imo.</div></div><hr />

It isn't everywhere. I believe drugs should be legal, all of them. Nobody has the right to tell you what you can and cannot do to your own body. But that's another discussion. They're a rock band full of little snitching bitches. Tack that on to how much of a joke they were before that, then you can guess why everyone in game is laughing at this announcement.

This. And Velvet Revolver. He got TWO solid shots at the brass ring, and screwed them both up. Most musicians get one shot, if they're lucky. He's just one of those addicts who can't stay clean, no clue why - and both bands bent over backwards to try and make it work with him. I don't hate the guy, I feel for him, it's sad what's happened. He's an amazing frontman when he's sober, too. <br />
<br />
As for Linkin Park, not my kind of band, kind of dated, but they were probably cheap enough for Blizzard to afford. I'm sure plenty will enjoy them. Definitely better than Van Halen. I'd prefer Tenacious D back, that was the best closing ceremony they've done. <br />
<br />
I get that some of the devs are rock/metal fans, but would it kill them to book a non-hard rock/metal act? Someone who could use a break in front of an audience like that? Someone new?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Each album has changed from the previous, but there has always been good songs on their releases. Minutes to midnight has bleed it out, living things has burn it down. I haven't listened to hunting party yet, but I am sure there is some good sound in there as well. As previously stated Linkin Park has always stated (back when Meteora came out) that their sound will always change, so this shouldn't shock people. <br />
<br />
What I find funny is all the people that constantly log in only to express their hate, regardless of who it was. Blink 182/Foo Fighters were terrible, Metallica has regressed so far that this is the only venue they could get, and now Linkin Park hasn't been relevant since 2001<br />
<br />
Strangely though, they sell way too many albums for a band that isn't relevant: 220,000 albums of Living Things in the first week, and Hunting Party came out. Revolver ranked The Hunting Party as the fourth best album of 2014.<br />
<br />
Sad that people will hate on anything...</div></div><hr />

Why not have an orchestra there playing some music from their games instead? It would actually make sense and their music is top notch anyways. <br />

I just had to laugh at loud at this. Yes, pot is illegal, but in the backstage world, it kinda does make them a bunch of pussies, especially considering the air at any concert is at least 50% pot, has been for decades. The idea of *any* band being good samaritan hallway monitors who go around reporting infractions is hilarious - you don't know that world, if you think bands do that - or should. <br />
<br />
I've worked in the music industry for years. Reporting another band for pot smoking backstage? Pussy move, period - and one that will block them from support slots at festivals and tours. It's so laughable I kind of have to doubt it actually happened, or it was something else going on, the two bands were fighting over groupies or catering and they were trying to stab the other band in the back. Or it's fiction. <br />
<br />
And, because I have a feeling you're going to be pendantic about it, yes, it's a dumb reason to hate the band, or their appearance.</div></div><hr />

Mainly those who are around 20-25 which probably is the biggest player base. <br />
<br />
They did the same with Metallica and Blink 182. <br />
<br />
I don't care much for Linkin Park so I'll just turn of the stream when they start. An advice for those who attend Blizzcon, go play Overwatch or what everis popular this year. It is usually a lot les crowded at those areas when the band plays.</div></div><hr />

I just had to laugh at loud at this. Yes, pot is illegal, but in the backstage world, it kinda does make them a bunch of pussies, especially considering the air at any concert is at least 50% pot, has been for decades. The idea of *any* band being good samaritan hallway monitors who go around reporting infractions is hilarious - you don't know that world, if you think bands do that - or should. <br />
<br />
I've worked in the music industry for years. Reporting another band for pot smoking backstage? Pussy move, period - and one that will block them from support slots at festivals and tours. It's so laughable I kind of have to doubt it actually happened, or it was something else going on, the two bands were fighting over groupies or catering and they were trying to stab the other band in the back. Or it's fiction. <br />
<br />
And, because I have a feeling you're going to be pendantic about it, yes, it's a dumb reason to hate the band, or their appearance.<br />

Well, not really. I've been LP fan since 2001 and visited 3 of their live performances in Russia (2007, 2009 and 2012). I prefer MtM and all other later stuff than Meteora/HT. Those two first albums didn't age well.<br />
I went to Blizzcon last year and I wasn't exactly happy with Metallica (not my type of band), but I'm sad I couldn't go this year due to how expensive trip to US is now for a Russian.<br />

Minutes to midnight has bleed it out, living things has burn it down. I haven't listened to hunting party yet, but I am sure there is some good sound in there as well. As previously stated Linkin Park has always stated (back when Meteora came out) that their sound will always change, so this shouldn't shock people. <br />
<br />
<br />
The thing is, on Hybrid Theory and Meteora they had a truly unique sound. It was rough, honest, and they weren't afraid to sound &quot;ugly&quot;. After Meteora they started to &quot;clean up&quot; their sound, essentially moving in a much more mainstream direction and their music became flat for those who wanted something that stood out. They tried to appeal more to the masses by becoming more generic and obviously succeeded as their popularity grew. <br />
<br />
In my eyes there were sell-outs musically and even though I understand what they're saying about their music always changing, it's kind of a bullshit statement. Sure, Living Things was more electronically focused and a little more &quot;gritty&quot;, but the essence is still the same, it's bland. As long as you keep your essence, what makes you unique, changing your music won't alienate your fans. Just look at Devin Townsend and compare Accelerated Evolution, Ghost and Epicloud. All three albums are vastly different from eachother, yet he never gives up what makes him unique musically. Linkin Park gave up what made them unique, which is why their fanbase is split between Pre-MtM and Post-MtM.</div></div><hr />

Who attends or watches BlizzCon from home for the closing concert? It's always the least interesting aspect of the whole event. I can't stand Link Park and consider them to be yesterday's news, but Blizzard have to try and cater to everyone who might attend his convention, and with something as diverse as music taste, people are bound to hate their choice. I can't stand that 90% of the gameplay videos I see only have some nonsense trance or dub step music in them, but that's me. Different strokes...<br />
<br />
I doubt one person going to Blizzcon said, &quot;Gee, I hope they get Linkin Park! They'll be great with [SJW scum bag] Whil Wheaton.&quot;<br />

Valve got Deadmau5 to perform in the TI, and make some tracks for Dota. Blizzard-Activision has more money than Valve, yet it can't afford to spend their money on a decent host and band.</div></div><hr />

Yeah Heard the first 2 albums then kinda stopped following music in general. I feel like I am so out f the scene. Still, it's nice to see them hanging around, even if it's just for that &quot;yeah I heard them in my college years&quot; feeling.

While I'd prefer electronica over hard rock, it's worth noting that many people watching / attending TI5 were annoyed or indifferent towards that performance. It felt anti-climactic. Deadmau5 is over rated anyway, most of his compositions lack melody, opinions are opinions.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm 28 and I like dubstep. I also like a lot of other music. I am glad I haven't become cynical or overly critcal towards my music. I still like and enjoy many bands that I enjoyed 10+ years ago. I think people tend to join the bandwagon and if a band become hated or &quot;sold out&quot; and unpopular, they shift into that perspective. I mean there are some genres I don't like, but for the most part, I like a lot of different styles of music.<br />
<br />
As someone who isn't that overly critcal toward music, the amount of cynicism or criticism towards a lot of bands/genres gets grating. Just shut up and enjoy :cool:</div></div><hr />

<br />
Once upon a time LP was good. I liked their first CD, then they released a remix album, and I hate remix albums. Then they started wearing baseball caps and 'updated' their sound to fit another crowd. They haven't been good since.</div></div><hr />

Well, they still have a spot in my heart. Actually, they're sort of legendary in my country (excluding most of the new songs, sadly). <br />
And yet people complain and hate on this info, I could expect that but damn... I wonder what do people NOT hate these days. Or what do people listen to if EVERYTHING proposed is hated.</div></div><hr />

it's sort of an allegory for wow...<br />
<br />
It's sort of an allegory for all existence. All things decay in time, some just take longer, eventually everything that any one of us has ever done will all be reduced to nothing, so it's redundant to say it applies to any one thing specifically.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's superb! Hat's off!<br />
<br />
So many whiners in this thread, so much angst to try and state their music is better or more relevant, whatever that means. Seriously? It's doesn't matter. <br />
<br />
Blizz decides, it's their show. Also, I buy the virtual ticket and like most of the bands that play but I have never watched one. <br />
<br />
Still debating if I will pay this year though, for the first time there seems hardly any Wow content and it's the only Blizz game I really like and was there on day one. Sad it's fallen so far out of favor, but it's not free to play with a huge store full of things to buy like all their newer products. Which I am not interested in.</div></div><hr />

Wow, that's not an ignorant statement at all to label an entire fanbase just because you don't like the band.</div></div><hr />
