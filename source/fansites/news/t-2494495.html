Developers' note: These can have a much higher uptime in PvP combat compared to the rest of the game resulting in a larger than intended amount of healing. As a result, we’re further reducing their effect in PvP. These changes were intended to be included in the Rise of Azshara content update notes and have been live since its release.<br />

I gave up after 3 hours of running around, finding a total of 2 normal rares + 1 commander rare, but my progress was still at 1/3. Proceeded to abandon the quest instead of spending any more time hunting rares. So either increase rare respawn times in Naz or reduce the amount needed to kill to 1.<br />
<br />
Then there was also some black market quest. During that time I spent looking for rares, I also tried to complete this. The quest text is very vague, only telling me to keep my eyes open in Naz. But I didn't find a single item for that quest, so that one also was abandoned. I assume that would have needed the treasure digging skill, but I have no idea how to get that.<br />
<br />
Also why are the hotfix lists bigger than BC release patch notes? :rolleyes: Seems like no testing has been done at all. Maybe time to hire some game testers? I've encountered a lot of bugs that are still not fixed.</div></div><hr />

Literally everyone but you. And since you commenting on it your &quot;not caring&quot; is a bit suspect. And you also seem to confuse &quot;difficulty&quot; with being tedious. Its not difficult to sit on a starfish spawn for an hour, its just a massive waste of time. If you find that difficult then you probably should have stayed on Hello Kitty MMO</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hmmmmmm.<br />
<br />
You complain on MMOChamp that the game is too hard because spawns don't happen fast enough, and you ask for a nerf. Then I suggest that leaving some quests as something you complete over time, perhaps while working on other content, is not so bad. And you somehow just managed to twist that in your head to suggest that I'm the one who has a distorted view of difficulty lol. Damn, that is some kind of special. <br />
<br />
But yea, just keep asking for nerfs. I mean hey, it's GREAT for the game. Subs are at an all time high. There has been an abundance of positive energy around the game of late. And of course, Classic looks like it'll be a giant flop with no interest ... since it is almost exclusively composed of quests that take time to complete ... some even over the course of more than one day ( gasp ... yes it is true ) ... AND with people competing for spawns!<br />
<br />
That all said, and just to clarify my original comment for you. It comes from a point of frustration with people such as yourself that run around complaining about something as benign as the starfish quest being too hard. Why do I care? Because I used to love WoW, and I've watched you destroy it. I've watched subs continue to decline and I've watched sentiment turn against the game as the entire system of world questing, difficulty, and danger were relegated to something on par with clicker heroes. <br />
<br />
So yes, we may be talking about a simple starfish gather quest here, but assume that I'm using this as a proxy for how you and your crew have now almost destroyed what was once a great game ... just because you find it too hard not to collect your starfish in a few minutes. Today it is Starfish. Previously it was shared spawns. At one time it was the dungeons being too hard for you in Cata. And of course, you demanded a LF system to make dungeons and raiding simpler ... with the list going on. All of which, cumulatively, have been terrible for the health of the game.<br />
<br />
So instead of racing to forums to complain about difficulty, why not get on with your questing, and pick up your Starfish as you see them. Nobody is getting a better deal on them than you. And there is nothing that will break in your life if it takes you a few days to get them. No need to camp spawn points my friend, just grab em as you see em.<br />
<br />
Cheers and have a great day.</div></div><hr />

You seem to be confusing tedium with difficulty. This patch isn't difficult. It's just tedious and not fun. I'm sorry you feel the need to defend such a massive waste of time in a video game that's supposed to be fun. Me, I've got better things to do that sit on a freaking starfish spawn waiting around because due to phasing issues running around ends up being even more enraging.<br />
<br />
Edit: Know what this patch feels like? It feels like it went live so they could PTR it since they lost all of the PTR data. That's what this patch feels like. This year is the 15th anniversary of this game, and for the first time a major content patch that we waited seemingly forever for, just makes me dread logging in.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's going to look like I'm defending here, and I am a little... but really, we're arguing over a quest that awards 75 faction as if it's make or break... In a week that 75 faction will be meaningless. If you see a quest that's too tedious and all you're going to get from it is a measly 75 faction, maybe just skip it?<br />
<br />
And if you're a real pro user, send some feedback in game. &quot;Hey devs, it would take hours to find 10 starfish, maybe a click 10 starfish quest isn't a very good idea, eh?&quot; When they see less than 1% of the player base is doing that daily, they'll figure out there's something wrong. I wouldn't be surprised if they nerfed it to collect 3 starfish or something eventually or maybe double or triple the spawn rate (though not sure that would really help in this case).</div></div><hr />
