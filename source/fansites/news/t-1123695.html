MMO-Champion Charity Livestream Marathon<br />
Nik and Kevin have started their charity livestream marathon. They will be leveling a Pandaren Monk from 1 to max level on the beta realm of Mekkatorque while trying to raise money in the name of MMO-Champion for the Save the Children charity started by Athene (Operation Sharecraft). <br />

Dragon Soul Difficulty Change<br />
At the completion of scheduled server maintenance during the week of April 30, the “Power of the Aspects” spell will grow more powerful, reducing the health and damage dealt of all enemies in the Dragon Soul raid by 20%. This spell will grow progressively stronger over time to reduce the difficulty and make the encounters more accessible. The spell will affect both normal and Heroic difficulties, but it will not affect the Raid Finder difficulty.<br />
<br />
Don’t need the help of the Dragon Aspects? The spell can be disabled by talking to Lord Afrasastrasz at the beginning of Dragon Soul.<br />
<br />
We hope you continue to enjoy Dragon Soul, and that these changes encourage you to attempt a higher difficulty, or just keep pushing to down that next boss.<br />
<br />
<br />
Annual Pass Beta Invite Update<br />
We want to confirm that, at this time, all World of Warcraft Annual Pass subscribers have been invited to the Mists of Pandaria beta test, with two groups of exceptions. One exception group are those who purchased an Annual Pass on or after April 18, and will receive their invite in a future wave. The second exception is a small list of remaining accounts from previous waves that encountered an error, and will be properly flagged for beta access as soon as we can resolve the issue.<br />
<br />
If you haven't yet purchased an Annual Pass, you still have time to guarantee your spot in the beta by signing up for a year agreement (link) before the offer expires on April 30. Those taking advantage of the Annual Pass receive Diablo III for free, access to the Mists of Pandaria beta, and the exclusive Tyrael's Charger flying mount for your World of Warcraft characters. <br />

Blue Posts<br />
Account-Wide Achievements<br />
Our intent is that most achievement rewards (mounts etc.) should be at the account level. I can't promise that because it's not in and working yet, but that's the intent.<br />
<br />
There are probably going to be enough account-level achievement questions that we should put a blog together to explain it all. We'll see if we can find time to do that. <br />
<br />
The word 'most' seems prevalent in any discussion involving the account-wide achievements. Is there a specific sort of achievement that should be character-only?<br />
We aren't planning (for now) to have any character only achievements, but there will probably be some account only achievements. These would be things like level a Horde and Alliance character to 90, which wouldn't make sense for one character. Technically, an account-only achievement is different from account-wide, hence the &quot;most.&quot; Maybe it's too technical a point to bother with though. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/221810-account-wide-achievements-are-a-let-down/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/4768327680?page=4#76))<br />
<br />
Ranged Weapons in MoP<br />
There are two issues here getting muddled together:<br />
<br />
Ranged weapons will have the stat budgets of two-handed weapons. You can treat them as two-handed weapons in most respects. That work hasn't been done yet.<br />
<br />
Ranged weapons are not going to be compensated for the loss of stats from no longer having a melee weapon equipped simultaneously. This is because all ranged-weapon slot type things have gone away, so everyone is affected evenly. However, we also want your damage when you log in for the first time to be about the same as it is now, so overall your damage will be compensated in a sense. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/221812-hunter-ranged-weapons/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/4768327799#20))<br />

<br />
a) Should sell max level food and water<br />

<br />
Isn't vendor price 25% of actual price? That would put it around 60K retail. I'm sure there will probably be some kind of faction discount tho.<br />
<br />
<br />
Er no... Why would they do that and remove HgwT?<br />
<br />
Because summoning stones/lock stones still exist. It's not about removing the concept of summoning from the game, it's just to prevent the kind of abuse like summoning an entire 40 man raid around the known universe endlessly griefing (since 40 people x 40 summons = trivialized travel/security). In Wrath, doing For the Alliance/Horde took planning, false raids, double agents, monitoring Trade...it was a lot of fun on balanced population servers. In Cata is pretty much a game of exploits when factions can wholesale teleport into each others throne rooms and kill the king before anyone else can even react.<br />
<br />
Summoning 1-2 people would be a useful tool or addition.</div></div><hr />

totally agree - large mounts are dumb, annoying at best. As for the other two &quot;new&quot; mounts, the ckicken is the same as the belf mount (same animations, movements, and skeleton) and the scorpion, is well, the scorpion in a different colour :/</div></div><hr />

All that still doesn't/wouldn't make it worth the thousands upon thousands of gold. The WOTLK vendor mount might not be up to date with items, but no one seems to care about the reagents all that junk. They use it for the repair which will be just fine come Mists. If people want food/water, stock up from the closest town/city etc which people currently do. Unless you can buy some pretty cool stuff from it, I think it's a silly gold sink.</div></div><hr />

Damn i have to save up for this and the jc mount. I don't have anywhere that amount. Im presuming jc mount will be 125k and yak would be 25k. I just re subbed gotta to buy the yak fast otherwise the price will inflate. I really thought the yak would be available by other means like raids drops etc but this is much better...i quiet like grinding. I did grind for jeeves and scepter mount from archaeology - they were worth the effort. The crane would be cool and if i can get it will be used for everyday use; the yak is just too big like the elephants. My faveourite mounts currently is the raven lord, any bears and scepter. No i havne't got raven lord...yet.<br />
<br />
I hope the jc mounts are obtainable via archaeology and only to jc's; im still pisted that my alchemist couldn't open canopic jars and learning archaeology not on my main is obsurd. Since my main does have all the other minor professions (for the achievement). Plus archaeololgy on a druid makes it a little easier - insta flying and hearthstone to nighhaven.</div></div><hr />

Scorpion mount = Finally i've always wanted a scorpion mount on my alliance they are so badass,tis like a clash of the titans charge.<br />

Also if i might make a suggestion,give the scorpion some attacks like a claw attack or cleave or a tail stinger,or even a charge attack,i mean its basically a massive war weapon only being used to ferry around people to which lets be honest i couldnt drive round all day with that poisonous stinger luring over my head could you?</div></div><hr />

Damn i have to save up for this and the jc mount. I don't have anywhere that amount. Im presuming jc mount will be 125k and yak would be 25k. I just re subbed gotta to buy the yak fast otherwise the price will inflate. I really thought the yak would be available by other means like raids drops etc but this is much better...i quiet like grinding. I did grind for jeeves and scepter mount from archaeology - they were worth the effort. The crane would be cool and if i can get it will be used for everyday use; the yak is just too big like the elephants. My faveourite mounts currently is the raven lord, any bears and scepter. No i havne't got raven lord...yet.<br />
<br />
I hope the jc mounts are obtainable via archaeology and only to jc's; im still pisted that my alchemist couldn't open canopic jars and learning archaeology not on my main is obsurd. Since my main does have all the other minor professions (for the achievement). Plus archaeololgy on a druid makes it a little easier - insta flying and hearthstone to nighhaven.<br />

Which is why that's the VENDOR price, aka the price you SELL it to the vendor for. The mount will probably be 100,000g+.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's the sell price, mate. Typically a sell price is 25% of the purchase price. That implies the mount is gonna be 60,000 gold to learn.</div></div><hr />

It's not about removing the concept of summoning from the game, it's just to prevent the kind of abuse like summoning an entire 40 man raid around the known universe endlessly griefing (since 40 people x 40 summons = trivialized travel/security). In Wrath, doing For the Alliance/Horde took planning, false raids, double agents, monitoring Trade...it was a lot of fun on balanced population servers. In Cata is pretty much a game of exploits when factions can wholesale teleport into each others throne rooms and kill the king before anyone else can even react.<br />
<br />
Summoning 1-2 people would be a useful tool or addition.<br />

So much for bringing the player not the class, eh?</div></div><hr />

It's been fairly non-existent so far, perhaps a lot of horde who've complained about how the Alliance never stop complaining find themselves in an odd spot right now :)<br />

Besides, I imagine if they make this faction neutral a lion mount will also appear somewhere down the line, patience is all we need.</div></div><hr />

THAT'S the big victory Metzen is promising the Alliance. We get to keep our Golden King mounts alliance only!<br />

This is how I feel. I've always loved the wolf mount, and it's the only one Alliance can't get!! On the other hand, I think the only original Alliance mount Horde can't get is the mechanostrider... but who wants that thing anyway??<br />
<br />
Ok, I was wrong. I put it all out in a Word document, and it turns out Alliance can't get two of their mounts whereas Horde can't have four of ours (I went ahead and added Draenei/Blood Elves and Goblins/Worgens to the list). <br />
<br />
Orc – wolf (n/a)<br />
Troll – raptor (ZG)<br />
Tauren – kodo (Brewmaster)<br />
Blood Elf – bird (MGT)<br />
Undead – skeletal horse (Strath)<br />
Goblin – car (n/a)<br />
<br />
Night Elf – cat (ZG)<br />
Human – horse (n/a)<br />
Draenei – elekk (n/a)<br />
Dwarf – ram (Brewmaster)<br />

Worgen – mountain horse (n/a)</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">boomkings</div><div class="date">2012-04-28, 03:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Possible sources for this mount:<br />
Faction vendor (likely requiring exalted with one of the MoP factions)<br />
Guild achievement reward (requiring purchase from the guild vendor)<br />
Craftable mount from a profession (think Vial of the Sands)<br />
Right now it doesn't look like it could be a personal achievement reward. Those rewards don't carry sellback prices. Definitely not of 15k anyways.<br />
<br />
I don't feel it's likely this is going to be a craftable mount. We've encountered this kind of mount before ( Reins of the Traveler's Tundra Mammoth) so it's not on par with the Vial of the Sands.<br />
<br />
It's almost certainly going to be a purchasable mount through a faction vendor</div></div><hr />

Horde actually got access to atleast 2 or 3/4 If Paladin horses and a Zheevra (It's more or less a horse with horns) So I'd say they only really miss the Elekk and the Mechanostrider.<br />

Take it, I'd make that trade for that beautiful scorpion in a heart beat. Then again, I'd also like being able to ride a wolf. Then I could pretend I was riding one of my failed druid brethren who got trapped in wolf form. <br />
<br />
On topic however, nice daily blink. I'm hoping I can farm enough gold in the first month or so of launch to buy the yak/jc mount and earn enough leftover to buy any rep mounts I'll need to grind for. I don't want to have to be like in cata, waiting a year after launch to have enough gold to finally get that sandstone drake.</div></div><hr />

Looks pretty nice. I've saved tons of gold from Cata so I'm sure cost won't be an issue. Is this available to get on the beta yet... where's the vendor?</div></div><hr />

In Cata is pretty much a game of exploits when factions can wholesale teleport into each others throne rooms and kill the king before anyone else can even react..<br />
<br />
You must have been on one unique server.....because on many servers I play on wasn't anything like that in wrath.</div></div><hr />

Some items and pets are stated as being bound to your battle.net account, but otherwise I'd imagine they meant specific to the wow account.</div></div><hr />
