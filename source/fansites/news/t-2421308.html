World First Level 120 - Gingi of Method<br />
Gingi, a balance druid from Method, was the first person to reach level 120 worldwide. He managed this feat in less than 5 hours and leveled with two other people. Congrats to him on his accomplishment. Check out his Twitch (https://www.twitch.tv/gingitv) to see his stream of the achievement!<br />

There are plenty of ways to verify who got it first, thats why things like wowprogress exist and other tracking websites. Regardless, he got to 120 in 4 hours, which no one in sight was even close to, the closest at that time were people at 117-118.</div></div><hr />

I'd like to see someone do this and actually do it by themselves and earn it. Not abuse some bug, or mechanic, or multi-class set up to burn everything in every zone down as fast as possible.</div></div><hr />

Partying in a MASSIVELY MULTIPLAYER game, the nerve of that man. He should be ashamed.<br />

I've asked this before, and don't think I've ever got an answer, so I'll try again. I too am always skeptical of &quot;world firsts&quot; without actual Blizzard verification. What ways are there to verify? I checked wowprogress, and don't see anything under characters submenus that tells us. <br />
<br />
I get that some here may not understand this due to the majority of gamers not living in the real world, but just stating he &quot;must&quot; be world first because he got it in 4 hours, and that he's from Method, doesn't mean anything.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Could there be an add on that constantly does a /who 120 search until it gets a ping? You'd just need one person per realm doing it to scan as a whole.<br />
<br />
Just a thought.</div></div><hr />

stating &quot;he levelled in 5 hours!!!!1!1!!&quot; is BS. But that gets clicks more than<br />
<br />
&quot;a group of 3 levelled one of the 3 characters in 5 hours, after many hours of planning and strategizing in alpha/beta&quot;<br />
<br />
I levelled to 120 in 12 hours total having zero preknowledge of what would be the most efficient levelling path (or caring). I'm sure they spent more than 8 hours figuring out their route or strategy, so who actually leveled faster?<br />
<br />
<br />
also, if they didn't actually do the zones: grats, now you have to spend more time doing them as 120 is way harder than 100-119 scaling wise and you're undergeared. but hey if people are willing to carry you to 120 like this gearing with dungeon spam and rep spam is trivial</div></div><hr />
