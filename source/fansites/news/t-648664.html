Hodir - Flash Freeze Hotfix<br />
A hotfix for this issue has been deployed. Hodir Hard Mode raiders rejoice! The casting of Flash Freeze will no longer interfere with the hard mode reward timer in this encounter. <br />
<br />
Recent In-Game Fixes - 05/14<br />
5/14/09<br />
The chance for the Lightning Overload talent to be triggered is being increased from 7/13/20% to 11/22/33%.<br />
We have decreased or removed the stealth detection from numerous items. Please visit this link for more information: http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=17163476972&amp;sid=1 (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/15/17163476972-changes-to-items-with-stealth-detection.html)<br />
Wild Growth can no longer proc Revitalize if you don’t have talent points spent in Revitalize.<br />
In the Yogg Saron encounter, Paladin Judgement spells will no longer cause diminish power from Crusher Tentacles to cease channeling.<br />
The vehicles in the Flame Leviathan encounter will now respawn faster.<br />
Hodir will no longer shatter his Rare Cache of Winter if defeated while casting a spell, like Flash Freeze.<br />
<br />
Armor Penetration Potential Changes<br />
We are now considering capping armor penetration at 100%. Armor could no longer go negative. We're not sure if we would do this in a hotfix or in 3.1.2. We just wanted to let anyone know who is furiously trying to acquire every armor pen item in the game.<br />
<br />
Note that there is not a not a cap on the amount of armor that can be reduced in WoW at the moment. Also note that capping armor penetration at 100% does not mean that you can always reduce every target's armor to 0%. The tooltip says &quot;up to&quot; for a reason.<br />
<br />
Yes, we understand this stat can be a little confusing.</div></div><hr />

he means it by, other classes finding it harder to detect them, therefore a buff to rogues as they can run around more with less chance of getting caught</div></div><hr />

If Hodir had started casting and was then defeated, he continued to cast anyway.<br />
this caused people who had beat hardmode to &quot;fail&quot; since he used a spell after he was defeated, sorta like it locked him in combat until the cast finished.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
To make this clearer:<br />
<br />
2:58- Hodir begins casting flash freeze.<br />
2:59- Raid &quot;defeats&quot; Hodir. Casting continues.<br />
3:00- The rare cache is shattered.<br />
3:07- Hodir finishes casting, leaves combat. Massive QQ and bitchfest at the bug begins.<br />
<br />
They fixed it so that he won't shatter the cache if you down him mid flash freeze.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Plus, doesn't forcing a target into the negatives require a lot of ArPen on your gear PLUS a double proc of Mjolnir Runestone AND Grim Toll?<br />
<br />
wtb removal of arena, pst, paying well</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rukh</div><div class="date">2009-05-15, 08:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Basically the Armor penetration mechanic is the most effed mechanic you ever did see, and it seems obvious to me if you're going to make a stat that is about bypassing armor, you might think to cap it at 100% penetration, but whatever.<br />
<br />
Basically what would happen is that if you managed to build enough armor penetration (and yes I think it took dual procs) armor would actually act as a damage magnifier instead of reduction. i.e. the more armor the opponent had the more damage you would do to them.</div></div><hr />

No more MOTHERFU**ing engeneering stealth detection rogues on arenas!! Finaly, Blizz catch a thing! I dont want change my profession only for this sh*ty goggles, but i want play fair arenas. Every 1 should have same posibilaties and its not fair then i got sapped and its GG where not all about your skill and just 1 item making game. <br />
Thank you Blizz thank you very mutch. Atlast &quot;Hands&quot; time has begun.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Balbaroy</div><div class="date">2009-05-15, 03:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey blizzard, instead of removing stealth on these items, how about addressing the insane amount of advantage opening with a rogue gives? In arenas right now it's whoever opens first = good game pretty much. That's not skill. I play with a rogue in 2v2 and when we face any team with a rogue, no one wants to come out of stealth like at all costs. It will be me and the other healer hitting each other with our maces like retards while the two rogues creep around trying to find each other for like 10 minutes. Change rogues!</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Not only that it's stupid, the main problem is that it continues to increase in usefulness exponentially the more you stack it due to the way armor works. It's better to stop it now before things could get ugly in future tiers.<br />
<br />
Exponential damage growth = bad</div></div><hr />

I wonder what sort of rewards they might add in the future for 150+ seals, since they are &quot;rebalancing&quot; the price against future rewards....<br />

Next all classes will get the same skills/stats and equipment will be only for looks. All professions will get their unique stuff (like epic gems, extra sockets or better enchants) removed...<br />

Are you actually suggesting removing stealth?<br />
If so, I am quite flabbergastered, sir.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">georgie123</div><div class="date">2009-05-18, 03:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">By removing the stealth detection, non-human/nelf rogues will have their chances to detect the human/nelf rogues drasticly decreased (if they dont have the goggles).<br />
So basically, the &quot;GG&quot; is now just gonna go to humans and night elves completely, whilst wearing higher quality heads, to effectively rape you non-rogues harder.</div></div><hr />
