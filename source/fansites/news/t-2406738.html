Developer Interview - Battle for Azeroth<br />
Forbes (https://www.forbes.com/sites/hnewman/2018/06/25/world-of-warcraft-game-director-talks-mythic-plus-azerite-drops-and-discord/#78bcf49a7864) posted part one of its two part interview earlier with Game Director Ion Hazzikostas about mythic plus, Azerite drops and more in Battle for Azeroth.<br />
<br />
<br />
Mythic Plus dungeons are designed and balanced with the idea that you can't swap gear during a run in Battle for Azeroth.<br />
Once you get past Normal and Heroic dungeons, sources of Azerite armor aren't infinitely repeatable. <br />
You can get Azerite Armor from an emissary cache, but not from a random world quest.<br />
You can get Azerite Armor from your weekly PvP reward, weekly Mythic+ reward, or from the Conquest system, but not just at the end of a match or Mythic+ dungeon.<br />
As it stands now, Mythic+ quality Azerite gear from your weekly cache will be associated with thresholds where new affixes are added (4, 7, 10). The level of Mythic+ completed in the week will determine which threshold of Azerite Armor you could get.<br />
As the expansion progresses, the ceiling of Mythic+ rewards will probably move from 10 to 15 much like in Legion. 10 will likely be harder in the beginning of the expansion as people learn the new dungeons.<br />
The team is trying to think how to better implement new dungeons to Mythic+ over the course of the expansion so issues like Seat of the Triumvirate being a harder/unpopular key doesn't happen.<br />
The team aims to have BfA dungeons retain the same difficulty of Legion dungeons. <br />
The team keeps affixes like Teeming and Bolstering in mind when designing the BfA dungeons.<br />
The 200 friend limit is a Battle.net limitation and the feedback asking to increase it has been heard, but communities should help in the meantime.<br />
The team looks at current chat systems when designing their own. Classic WoW was influenced by AOL Instant Messenger and others.<br />
Adding in game features like in-game voice chat is more of a convenience and not trying to compete with outside programs like Discord. <br />
In-game voice chat helps when doing world quests or other group content where you don't necessarily want to send Discord info or other chat program information.<br />
<br />

<br />
No, they didn't. They restricted the use of an addon that was automating the process, which now forces you to actually interact with the game systems.<br />
<br />
On topic, glad to hear there's multiple sources of gaining azerite armor rather than just luck of the draw at the end of a dungeon.</div></div><hr />

Means that you will get azerite pieces at end of matches and m+ dungeons.<br />

<br />
Same as with the Character limit, make it so it's a Payable option (like early access), where you can pay a small sum to increase the friends limit by 25/50 or increase the Character cap on your Account.<br />
This way not everyone will make 200 Characters/500 Friends, but those who wish do have the option to do so. Quality of life improvements are very popular and even if they increase the cap at a later date, those who paid for it had the benefit of earlier access.<br />
A lot of games (MMO's) have a model like this, where you can pay for convenience but it's not mandatory.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's great but all the tuning in the world won't balance classes in Mythic plus with this change, some classes e.g fire mage need completely different item sets to be competitive on aoe and single target while others e.g windwalker monks do not. Why would anyone bring a spec that has to choose to be good at either aoe or single target over one that can do both. <br />
<br />
While this should only impact people at the top end it won't. Everyone who has played any competitive game for long enough knows that what ever the pros do will be copied by a big enough portion of the player base that it will negatively impact everyone.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's probably not going to be enough to gear up with, given that loot in the chest can roll for any slot. Which in turn means that you can't really get around raiding if you're looking for the best gear. And since Azerite gear from raids is fixed in item level the chance that someone who's mainly doing LFR content is going to have a mythic Azerite piece is pretty damn slim.<br />
<br />
Good stuff.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hell no. You pay $60 for the game, plus $15 a month now you want more micro-transactions for a bigger friends list/charcter limit.<br />
<br />
Thats shit games that dont have a sub do to monetize. the whole point of a sub is to not have to deal with shit like that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Item Level is one thing, you could get high item level pieces from the M+ chest in Legion as well, but no set pieces.<br />
So in BfA you can get high item level Azerite pieces from the Chest, but not the actual raid Azerite pieces, which have other bonuses on them.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
What? No. They literally just listed several ways each week to get azerite armor. Emissary caches, end of a Mythic+ dungeon or PvP match, the Conquest system rewards and then of course the weekly M+ and PvP rewards,<br />
<br />
'You can get Azerite Armor from an emissary cache, but not from a random world quest.<br />
You can get Azerite Armor from your weekly PvP reward, weekly Mythic+ reward, or from the Conquest system, but not just at the end of a match or Mythic+ dungeon.'<br />
<br />
If you choose not to do any of that then that's on you, but there are plenty of ways to obtain new azerite armor each week.</div></div><hr />

No, if you were not lazy like me and use no add-ons this would not effect you in any way, I just laugh at changes like this because if you use the base UI shit like this will never effect you.</div></div><hr />

I know some of you're thinking &quot;it's too many, other mmos don't allow that many&quot;. WoW is like what *15* years old now, many of us have played for that long and have hit the 50 max level characters several times. All we're asking for is a *paid* option to increase the character limit on your account. You collect pets, mounts, do this and that. When I'm not raiding with my guild I level my characters. I've done that in all mmos I've played and I don't plan to stop.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What is with people and trying to suggest every fix or new feature in WoW should become a mirco-transation so that Blizzard would do it? I get the idea of cosmetic items, pets and mounts being sold as a extra thing (although it's definitely arguable that Blizzard price them far to high) but I've been hearing people suggest Allied Races, Communities, Voice Chat, Gear and now fixing the friends list limit should also all be paid for on top of a $60 dollar game plus monthly subscription. Bloody ridiculous.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes they actually did. They removed addon ability, yes. But they also removed all current standard interface option for grouping. You can't right click to find a group in BfA.<br />
<br />
You can't even copy paste the name of the quest yourself to make the group. You have to type the whole quest name to create or search a group. And that also limits you to your language pool, something addon had no problem with, screwing europe even more.<br />
<br />
Their choice is hilariously stupid. They basically blocked the ability for random people to meet and quest together... Which in a MMORPG is retarded beyond belief.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They just said you can get azerite gear from different sources, ilevel (raw int) and the special raid traits still should make the raid pieces desirable. What I noticed at least for cloth is that Longstrider trait is only available on 3 pieces outside of raid - i expect the trait will most likely be on all 4 azerite pieces from Uldir.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To clarify. No you cannot get azerite gear from mythic+ dungeon chests at the end of the dungeon. they cannot drop for you from completing a M+ dungeon.<br />
<br />
I and many others in my community have been doing lots of M+ and are 100% sure they can't be looted from the chests.</div></div><hr />

Does it mean I can't farm Azerite Armor ? That I need to pray and hope to get the right piece on my weekly cache ? Is that legion legendary unbalanced abysmal low drop rate again ?<br />

I was under the impression that Azerite Armor would replace Artefact Weapons, Legendaries, raid Tier Set and compensate the fact that most classes have been pruned from end of Legion to BFA.

You are correct, yes. You cannot farm gear, you just need to do as many Emissaries as you can and push your key to 10 and pray you get a good trait.</div></div><hr />

Currently there are about maybe 10-12 azerite pieces of gear in total from all m+ and 4 from Uldir, in total 16. So realistically in 16 weeks you can have all possible azerite armor.<br />
<br />
or you can end up with 16 usless pieces from weekly chests :) since azerite is not guaranteed - meaning it will be like 2-3 % drop chance considering how big loot tables in mythic + are.<br />
<br />
gl farming that :)</div></div><hr />

+1 The spec binded Azerite armor is even more RETARDED than the Artifact weapons was. Everyone was happy when devs told the Heart of Azeroth will not be spec specific. But this thing with armors is just a joke.... They're realy stupid I think.</div></div><hr />

That's good on one hand, because it increases replayability. And horrible on the other hand because it's the same RNG issue again.</div></div><hr />

Azerite is part of the normal loot tables. It is more like trinkets or tier sets.</div></div><hr />
