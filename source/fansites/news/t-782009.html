<br />
Q. In what regions is the Cataclysm pre-sale available? What day/time is Cataclysm launching in my region?<br />
A. The pre-sale is available in the following regions, with realms scheduled to launch at the following times:<br />
<br />
Americas, Australia, New Zealand, and Southeast Asia - December 7 at 12:01 a.m. PST Europe and Russia - December 7 at 12:01 a.m. CET<br />
<br />
Q. When will my credit card (or other payment method) be charged?<br />
A. You will be charged on the day that you place your pre-order for World of Warcraft: Cataclysm.<br />
<br />
Q. Why do I need to log in to the game once after I’ve upgraded?<br />
A. The first time you log in after pre-ordering, your account will become eligible to begin receiving the Cataclysm data when it’s available. The data will automatically download in the background while you play World of Warcraft or while you have the Launcher window open.<br />
<br />
Q. Can I pre-order a physical copy of Cataclysm and have it shipped?<br />
A. Not from Blizzard Entertainment, but many retailers offer pre-orders of physical boxes and Collector’s Editions.<br />
<br />
Q. Will a digital version of the Collector's Edition, with the exclusive pet, be available?<br />
A. No. The World of Warcraft: Cataclysm Collector's Edition is exclusive to physical retail copies. The digital version consists of the standard edition. <br />
<br />
<br />
Patch 4.0.3 / The Shattering Date<br />
<br />
Even though we have a set December 7 release date for Cataclysm, we still want to avoid giving out specific dates for upcoming events and patches in the event we need to shift our scheduling around at all to meet production needs.<br />
<br />
I'll try my best here to give you useful information without it feeling like a non-answer. :)<br />
<br />
Be patient! If you're really hoping to roll brand new characters once the shattering of Azeroth takes place, I'd strongly recommend just waiting. You'll get a sense soon enough for how events will unfold from now until December 7. I suggest you stick to your main characters for now. Very soon the pre-Cataclysm events will begin and they'll continually ramp up in severity and things to do over time, leading up to the shattering (patch 4.0.3a). You're going to want to participate in these events, as they'll only be around for a short time and will not return once Deathwing is unleashed. <br />
<br />
[...] One thing we'll be clarifying a bit better next week is the distinction between what is in patch 4.0.3 versus when the shattering takes place.<br />
<br />
Patch 4.0.3 will implement virtually all of the content necessary to make the changes to Azeroth, but those changes will actually take place in patch 4.0.3a, which is scheduled to be released shortly after patch 4.0.3.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Expertise Cap<br />
Due to recalibrating expertise for Cataclysm, level 80-83 creatures (which includes bosses) dodge and parry less, so you need less expertise, 23, to be exact. Sorry we didn't announce this. I would classify it as an unintended consequence (though not unknown) and not a desired change on our part.<br />
<br />
At level 85, you will need 26 again.<br />
<br />
<br />

Current class balance<br />
At 85 on the current beta build, Fury is high. Ret, Feral and the DKs are either close or slightly high. Rogues and Enhance might be a little low. This is how things look this AM and after a few more raid tests and balance tweaks, we might feel differently.<br />
<br />
We know not everyone is able to beta raid test, but it is very useful to compare our internal tests and estimations to what players are actually able to accomplish. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/27401648942/enhancement-shaman-future/))<br />
<br />
Unique Buffs<br />
Nobody brings unique buffs anymore. It isn't a tenable design when you have 30 different specs and raid groups that are sized 10 and 25 to have 30 very valuable unique buffs. I further question how fun it is to know that you probably only got brought because you make everyone else functional. <br />
<br />
[...] A raid leader should bring you because you perform well, contribute to guild progression and are a pleasant person to play with. If your dps is dreadfully low, then it's understandable if a progression-focused leader feels like he or she can't afford a spot for you. The only PvE specs we felt were dreadfully low in the previous expansion were Arms warrior, Frost mage, Subtlety rogue and BM hunter. If we can fix those for Cataclysm then we'll be in pretty good shape and the onus will be on you to be a capable enough raider that folks want to raid with you.

<br />
Insane of the Membrane breaking in 4.0.3<br />
Most of those changes are specific to when the world actually changes (mounts, feats, quests, etc). That's technically patch 4.0.3a. We'll have more information on the distinctions between patches 4.0.3 and 4.0.3a to announce next week.

Shield of the Righteous changes in latest build<br />
We changed Shield Slam and Shield of the Righteous to do more base damage and scale less with AP. This was to fix a problem where numbers became absurdly large with a lot of AP, especially under the effects of Vengeance, dwarfing the damage done by druid or DK tanks. With these changes, a tank in heroic dungeon blues should deal the same damage with no Vengeance, but Vengeance will have less of an impact.<br />
<br />
The coefficient for Shield of the Righteous was lowered from 120% to 60% at 3 Holy Power. The coefficient for Shield Slam was lowered from 75% to 60%. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/27401648032/beta-build-13221/))<br />
<br />
Word of Glory<br />
We buffed Word of Glory base points for Holy paladins. We nerfed the Ret and Prot talents to keep it about the same for them. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/27401648032/beta-build-13221/))<br />

Vanish Bug<br />
The only live Vanish bug we know of had to do with pets and guardians still being able to target you. We have fixed that on our end. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/27387875193/vanish-nerf/))<br />

Enhancement<br />
We are seeing Enhancement at about the same dps they were at before at level 80, and are competitive with e.g. Fury warriors, Ret paladins and Unholy DKs at 85 as far as PvE dps goes. As always, it depends a lot on the encounter and the individual behind the keyboard.<br />
<br />
If you find that is not the case for you, let us know, but it would be helpful to provide something more than anecdotal information. <br />
<br />
[...] From a quick glimpse at some of these parses, the priority of abilities seems fine but the numbers are lower than some of the other ones we've seen. That suggests it could be a gear issue. Mastery is pretty good for Enhancement shaman, and some chose to reforge and regem for it. I didn't go inspect all of you to know if you tried that or not.<br />
<br />
We'll keep looking into the issue though.<br />
<br />
I am looking at an Al'Akir parse right at this moment with an Enh shaman tied with Frost DKs, Fury and Ret. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/27387877196/enhancement-love/))<br />
<br />
Enhancement and Lava Burst<br />
We don't intended for Enhance to use Lava Burst rotationally. If you hard cast a Lava Burst when you're out of range, no problem. The value of Lava Burst to score a crit will also go down as your natural crit rate rises (at 85; I assume your crit rate is probably pretty high at 80).

<br />
A large assortment of all-new daily quests and rewards are now available in Hyjal, where players can help the Guardian (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/4070/)s of Hyjal push back the allies of Ragnaros and establish a forward operating base in the Firelands (http://db.mmo-champion.com/a/5802/)! In order to partake in the Regrowth (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/8936/) and Molten Front daily quests, players must have at least completed Mount Hyjal up to and including the quest Aessina's Miracle (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/25372/). Once this quest has been completed, players should speak with Matoclaw in the Sanctuary of Malorne to take part in the Regrowth (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/8936/) efforts.<br />
<br />
<br />
New Quest Chain (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/90106/): Elemental Bonds<br />

Battle-hardened veterans of the Horde and Alliance now have an opportunity to strike at Ragnaros the Firelord and his loyal servants by venturing into their domain via Sulfuron Spire in Mount Hyjal.<br />
<br />
<br />
New Legendary Item: Dragonwrath, Tarecgosa's Rest (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/94019/)<br />
<br />
Steadfast raiders have an opportunity to embark on a series of quests to create an all-new legendary caster staff. In order to begin the process of assembling the staff, players must first kill a Molten Lord in the Firelands (http://db.mmo-champion.com/a/5802/), or have completed any of the achievements Bastion of Twilight, Blackwing Descent (http://db.mmo-champion.com/a/4842/), or Throne of the Four Winds (http://db.mmo-champion.com/a/4851/). Once any of these achievements have been unlocked, players can accept the quest A Legendary Engagement (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/29132/) from Ziradormi in Grommash Hold in Orgrimmar (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/12812/), or Coridormi atop the Wizard's Sanctum in Stormwind (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/12774/) (players who have already completed any of these achievements are immediately eligible for this quest). Players who become eligible for the quest series by killing a Molten Lord in the Firelands (http://db.mmo-champion.com/a/5802/) will automatically receive the quest Your Time Has Come (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/29453/), leading them to the start of the questline. The legendary item questline is only available to druids, mages, priests, shaman, and warlocks.<br />
<br />
<br />
New User Interface Feature: Dungeon Journal<br />
<br />
A host of dungeon information is now built into the user interface via the all-new Dungeon Journal. This feature can be accessed via a new button in the Navigation tray from anywhere in the world. Boss background story, encounter details, abilities, and loot can be viewed with the Dungeon Journal for all bosses which have been integrated into the new system (this includes bosses for all Cataclysm dungeons and raids). Additional dungeons are planned to be incorporated in future updates.<br />
<br />
<br />
Achievements<br />
<br />
Bear-ly Made It (http://db.mmo-champion.com/a/5858/) (new achievement): Save all four prisoners before they are sacrificed in Zul'Aman (http://db.mmo-champion.com/a/691/) on Heroic difficulty.<br />
<br />
<br />
Classes: General<br />
<br />
All healing critical strikes now heal for 2 times a normal heal (+100%), up from 1.5 times a normal heal (+50%).<br />
Players are once again free to dance in combat (without causing graphic errors). Other animations, such as attacks, will take precedence over dancing. The dance animation will be suppressed until the higher priority animation is complete. Fun has been unnerfed.<br />
<br />
<br />
Buff (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/64036/)s<br />
<br />
All class abilities which place a buff on friendly targets no longer generate any threat. This goes for raid-wide buffs like Mark of the Wild (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/1126/) and Power Word: Fortitude (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/21562/), as well as triggered effects such as Blessed Resilience (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/33143/) or Fingers of Frost (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/83074/), and single-target buffs like Dark Intent (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/80398/) and Hysteria (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/55975/). The exception is buffs which directly cause healing or damage, such as Thorns (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/467/) or Renew (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/139/). Abilities such as these still generate normal threat.<br />
<br />
<br />
Crowd Control<br />
<br />
Many crowd control abilities no longer cause creatures to attack players when they are cast. The creature will not attack the player when the crowd control wears off, and nearby creatures will not become hostile to the player either. However, if a visible player gets too close to the target creature, the creature will remember and attack the player when the crowd control effect wears off. The intent is to make it easier for dungeon groups to manage crowd control assignments and pulling packs of hostile NPCs. The abilities affected by this change are: Hibernate (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/2637/), Entangling Roots (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/339/), Wyvern Sting (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/24131/) (will still cause hostility when it begins to deal damage), Freezing Trap (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/60192/), Polymorph (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/61780/), Repentance, Shackle Undead (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/9484/), Blind (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/2094/), Hex (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/51514/), Bind Elemental (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/76780/), Banish (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/710/), Seduction (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/6358/).<br />
<br />
<br />
Pets<br />
<br />
The Aggressive pet stance has been removed and replaced with the Assist stance. This stance will cause the player's pet to attack the player's target. The pet will not change targets unless the master attacks a new target for a few seconds.<br />
The Defensive pet stance will now only cause the player's pet to attack enemies which attack the pet or the master.<br />
<br />
<br />
Spell Interrupt (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/61381/)s<br />
<br />
When interrupted while casting a single-school spell such as Mind Flay (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/15407/) or Frostbolt (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/116/), players will now be able to cast dual-school spells such as Mind Spike (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/73510/) (Frost and Shadow schools) or Frostfire Bolt (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/44614/) (Frost and Fire schools). However, being interrupted while casting a dual-school spell will still interrupt all respective schools as intended.<br />
<br />
<br />
Stats (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/13824/)<br />
<br />
Death knights, paladins, and warriors no longer receive any bonus to their chance to dodge from Agility. Their base chance to dodge is now a fixed 5%.<br />
Death knights, paladins, and warriors now receive 27% of their Strength bonuses as parry rating, up from 25%. This conversion still only applies to Strength above and beyond their base Strength.<br />
<br />
<br />
General Class Bug Fixes<br />
<br />
Players should no longer incorrectly receive a message stating they interrupted a spell cast when they did not.<br />
Action bars will no longer briefly disappear when characters that have a stance bar enter a vehicle.<br />

Rather than placing a 15% maximum health floor on Death Strike (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/45470/) healing while in Frost or Unholy Presence (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/48265/), it causes the next Death Strike (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/45470/) within 15 seconds after killing a foe that yields experience or Honor Points (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/43308/) to heal for at least 20% of the death knight's maximum health (still requires Frost or Unholy Presence (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/48265/)).<br />

<br />
Druids now gain 1 attack power per point of Strength, down from 2. They continue to gain 2 attack power per point of Agility while in Cat Form (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/768/) or Bear Form (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/5487/). In addition, Cat Form (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/768/)'s scaling rate from gear upgrades was slower than other classes, which was causing them to fall behind in damage with higher item levels. To counter the Strength change and improve scaling, the following changes have been made. All numbers cited are for level-85 druids.<br />
Ferocious Bite (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/22568/) damage has been increased by 15%. In addition, its base cost has been reduced to 25 energy and it can use up to 25 energy, for up to a 100% damage increase.<br />
Mangle (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/33876/) (Cat) damage at level 80 and above has been increased to 540% weapon damage, up from 460%, and bonus damage has been lowered to 302.<br />
Rake (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/1822/) initial damage on hit now deals the same damage as each periodic tick (and is treated the same for all combat calculations). Periodic damage now gains 14.7% of attack power per tick, up from 12.6%, and base damage per tick has been lowered from 557 to 56. There is a known issue with Rake (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/1822/)'s tooltip being incorrect from this change will be corrected in a future patch.<br />
Ravage damage at level 80 and above has been increased to 950% weapon damage, up from 850%, and bonus damage has been lowered to 532.<br />
Savage Roar (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/52610/) now grants 80% increased damage to melee auto attacks, up from 50%. The Glyph of Savage Roar (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/64307/) remains an unchanged bonus of 5% to that total.<br />
Shred (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/5221/) damage at level 80 and above has been increased to 540% weapon damage, up from 450%, and bonus damage has been lowered to 302.<br />
Entangling Roots (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/339/) and the equivalent spell triggered by Nature's Grasp (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/16689/) no longer deal damage.<br />
Innervate (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/29166/) now grants an ally target 5% of his or her maximum mana over 10 seconds, but still grants 20% of the druid's maximum mana over 10 seconds when self-cast.<br />
Omen of Clarity (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/16864/) clearcasting buff from now lasts 15 seconds, up from 8 seconds.<br />

Fungal Growth (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/81291/) spell visual effect has been updated to be less visually intrusive and more aesthetic.<br />
Lunar Shower (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/33605/) has been redesigned. When casting Moonfire (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/8921/), the druid gains Lunar Shower (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/33605/). Lunar Shower (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/33605/) increases the direct damage done by Moonfire (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/8921/) by 15/30/45%, and reduces the mana cost by 10/20/30%. This effect stacks up to 3 times and lasts 3 seconds. While under the effects of Lunar Shower (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/33605/), Moonfire (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/8921/) generates 8 Solar Energy, and Sunfire (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/93402/) generates 8 Lunar Energy. The amount of Lunar/Solar Energy gained does not change based on the number of points spent in the talent, or stacks of Lunar Shower (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/33605/). Those druids who wish to delay transition in or out of an Eclipse (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/93333/) state should now cast the one of their two basic attacks which will not move the Eclipse (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/93333/) bar (either Starfire (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/2912/) or Wrath (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/5176/)).<br />
Solar Beam has a new spell effect.<br />
Wild Mushroom: Detonate (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/88751/) can now also trigger Earth and Moon (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/48506/), in addition to Starfire (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/2912/) and Wrath (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/5176/).<br />
<br />
<br />
Feral<br />
<br />
Bear damage abilities were scaling too fast with higher gear levels compared to other tanks, so the following balance changes have been made. All the numbers cited are for level 85 characters; numbers will be lower for lower-level characters.<br />
Faerie Fire (Feral) (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/60089/) base damage has been raised to 2950, up from 679. Attack power scaling has been decreased to 10.8%, down from 15%.<br />

Mangle (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/33876/) (Bear) weapon damage percent has been decreased to 190%, down from 260%. Bonus damage has been increased to 3306, down from 754.<br />
Swipe (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/62078/) base damage has been increased to 929, up from 215. Attack power scaling has been decreased to 12.3%, down from 17.1%.<br />
Thrash (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/77758/) initial base damage has been increased to 1042, up from 339. Initial damage attack power scaling has been decreased to 9.82%, down from 19.2%. Periodic base damage has been increased to 581, up from 189. Periodic damage attack power scaling has been decreased to 1.67%, down from 3.26%. In addition, a bug was corrected where armor decreased the periodic damage done by this ability.<br />
Lacerate (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/33745/) initial base damage has been increased to 3608, up from 2089. Initial damage attack power scaling has been decreased to 5.52%, down from 7.66%. Periodic base damage has been increased to 69, up from 16. Periodic damage attack power scaling has been decreased to 0.369%, down from 0.512%.<br />

<br />
<br />
Restoration<br />
<br />
Symbiosis (Mastery) has been removed and replaced with Harmony (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/77495/). Harmony (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/77495/) increases direct healing by an additional 10%, and casting direct healing spells grants an additional 10% bonus to periodic healing for 10 seconds. Each point of mastery increases each bonus by an additional 1.25%. Healing Touch (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/5185/), Nourish (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/50464/), Swiftmend (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/18562/), and the initial heal from Regrowth (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/8936/) are considered direct healing spells for the purposes of this Mastery. All other healing from druid spells is considered periodic.<br />

Glyph of Ferocious Bite (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/67600/) has been redesigned. It now causes Ferocious Bite (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/22568/) to heal the caster for 1% of maximum health for each 10 energy used.<br />
Glyph of Innervate (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/56947/) now causes the druid to gain 10% of his or her maximum mana over 10 seconds when Innervate (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/29166/) is used on a friendly target, in addition to Innervate (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/29166/)'s base effect.<br />
<br />
<br />
Set Bonuses<br />
<br />
The 4-piece Balance druid tier 11 PvE set bonus, Astral Alignment (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/90164/), now provides a total of 15% critical strike chance with 3 charges, decreasing by 5% per charge, instead of 99% decreasing by 33% per charge. This change was made because the set bonus proved so valuable it was not possible to upgrade out of the set into tier 12. To compensate, changes have been made to Starfire (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/2912/) and Wrath (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/5176/) (listed at the top of the druid class section).<br />
The 2-piece Restoration druid tier 11 PvE set bonus has been redesigned to work with the new Restoration druid mastery. Druids with this bonus now receive the bonus to Spirit while the Harmony (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/77495/) mastery bonus to periodic healing is active.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Marksmanship<br />

<br />
<br />
Survival<br />
<br />
Black Arrow (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/3674/) damage done has been increased by roughly 40%.<br />
<br />
<br />
Pets<br />
<br />
10 new rare tamable beasts have been added, each of which provides a unique taming challenge. Will you be the first hunter to tame Deth'tilac, the rarest and most powerful of them all? Players will need to progress through the Hyjal Regrowth (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/8936/) and Molten Front daily questing areas in order to unlock access to the full gamut of taming challenges.<br />
Intervene (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/53476/) (Pet Tenacity (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/59911/)) has been redesigned. The pet runs at high speed toward a group member, reducing the damage done by the next melee or ranged attack made against them equal to 50% of the pet's total health.<br />

Arcane Blast damage done has been reduced by 5%.<br />
Pyroblast (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/11366/) cast when Hot Streak (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/44445/) is not active was doing slightly less damage than the Hot Streak (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/44445/) version. Its damage has been increased so that both versions of Pyroblast (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/11366/) now do the same amount of damage.<br />
Spellsteal (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/30449/) mana cost has been increased by 100%.<br />
<br />
<br />
Fire<br />
<br />
When Impact (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/12355/) spreads Living Bomb (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/44461/), it will only be spread to two additional targets. The net effect is that if the mage's most recent Living Bomb (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/44461/) target is the same as their Impact (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/12355/) target, that target will no longer lose the Living Bomb (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/44461/) effect. If Living Bomb (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/44461/) is active on multiple targets when the Impact (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/12355/) effect is cast, Living Bomb (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/44461/) will remain active on the most recent Living Bomb (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/44461/) target, and will be added to two other nearby targets.<br />
<br />
<br />
Frost<br />
<br />
Deep Freeze (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/71757/) and Ring of Frost will cause diminishing returns on each other, in addition to the spells they normally share diminishing returns with.<br />

Seal of Righteousness (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/20154/) now can be activated by any melee ability, not just single target melee abilities. This adds Hammer of the Righteous (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/53595/) (the physical component) and Divine Storm (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/53385/) to the list of abilities that can activate this seal. In addition, Seal of Righteousness (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/20154/) procs can now be critical effects.<br />

<br />
Holy<br />
<br />
Beacon of Light (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/53652/) can no longer be dispelled. In addition, it now transfers 100% of the heal from Holy Light (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/635/), but still 50% of the heal from other spells.<br />
Denounce (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/85510/) has been redesigned. It still reduces the mana cost of Exorcism (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/879/). However, it no longer has a chance on Holy Shock of making Exorcism (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/879/) free and instant. Instead, it has a 50/100% chance to prevent the Exorcism (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/879/) target from causing critical effects for the next 6 seconds. This effect can be dispelled.<br />
Holy Shock (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/25914/) mana cost has been decreased to 7% of base mana, down from 8%.<br />
Illuminated Healing (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/76669/) (Mastery) has been adjusted slightly so that if a paladin refreshes an existing copy of his or her own Illuminated Healing (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/76669/) on a target, the new absorption amount will be added into the old absorption amount and the duration will be reset. The total absorption created can never exceed 1/3 of the casting paladin's health.<br />
Infusion of Light (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/54149/) can now lower the cast time of Flash of Light (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/19750/) by 0.75/1.5 seconds, in addition to Holy Light (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/635/) and Divine Light (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/82326/). In addition, the old Denounce (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/85510/) spell overlay effect has been transferred to Infusion of Light (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/54149/) since Denounce (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/85510/) is no longer a proc.<br />
Speed of Light (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/85499/) now increases movement speed when Holy Radiance (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/82327/) or Divine Protection (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/498/) are cast. In addition, this talent now reduces the cooldown of Holy Radiance (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/82327/) by 13/26/40 seconds, up from 10/20/30.<br />
Walk in the Light (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/85102/) now improves Word of Glory (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/85673/) healing by 30%, in addition to its current effects.<br />

Hammer of the Righteous (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/53595/) mana cost has been lowered to 10%, down from 12% to match Crusader Strike (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/35395/).<br />
Holy Shield (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/20925/) has been redesigned. This talent is now an activated ability off the global cooldown. It grants 20% increased block amount to a paladin's shield blocks for 10 seconds, with a 30-second cooldown.<br />
Judgements of the Wise (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/31878/) now procs on attempt rather than on strike, which means judgements that miss can still grant mana. This is to help ensure Protection paladins are not starved for mana if they aren't capped on hit rating.<br />

Selfless Healer (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/85804/) can no longer be dispelled and cannot be stolen via Spellsteal (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/30449/); and, in addition to its current effects, it lowers the cooldown of Word of Glory (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/85673/) by 5/10 seconds.<br />

Warrior Bug Fixes<br />
<br />
It is no longer possible in some encounters to use Charge (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/61685/) when closer than its minimum range.<br />
<br />
<br />
Currency<br />
Conquest &amp; Honor Points (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/43308/)<br />
<br />
All existing Conquest Points in the Currency tab have been converted to Honor Points (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/43308/). Any points above the Honor Point cap must be spent within the next week before Season 10 starts. Once Season 10 begins, all Honor Points (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/43308/) exceeding the 4,000 point cap will be converted into gold at a rate of 35 silver per point and mailed to characters.<br />
The minimum cap on Conquest Points earned per week from Arenas is now 1350 at 1500 or less Arena rating. The maximum cap is now 2700 at 3000 or more Arena rating. The cap continues to scale non-linearly between those two points. For comparison, during season 9 the cap ranged between 1343 and 3000.<br />
The game now separately tracks different Conquest Point caps for Battlegrounds and Arenas. Battleground ratings receive a bonus of 22.2% to the cap they generate, meaning the cap from Battleground rating now ranges between 1650 and 3300. Players may earn a total number of Conquest Points per week equal to the higher of these two caps, but once players have reached the cap for either Arenas or Battlegrounds, they can no longer earn Conquest Points from that source. Conquest Points from Battleground holidays only count toward the total Conquest Point cap.<br />
<br />
Example: During the first week of Season 10 everyone starts with a rating below 1500. Therefore, the cap from Rated Battlegrounds will be 1650 and the cap from Arena rating will be 1350. In the first week, the character wins enough Arena matches to reach the 1350 point cap. After that point, Arena wins will no longer grant Conquest points for the week. However, the character can still earn up to 300 additional points, but can only earn those points from either Rated Battlegrounds, or from the Conquest Point bonus for holiday and/or daily random Battlegrounds. The following week the cap will be recalculated based on the character's ratings, and it is possible Arena rating could now generate the higher cap. The second week, the character's cap from Arena rating is 1800, and the cap from Rated Battlegrounds is 1650. The character has a total cap of 1800 Conquest points for the week. Up to 1650 points can be earned from Rated Battlegrounds, but the last 150 must come from a different source.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Valor &amp; Justice Points<br />
<br />
All existing Valor Points in the Currency tab have been converted to Justice Points. Any points above the Justice Point cap will be converted into gold at a rate of 47 silver per point and mailed to characters.<br />
The maximum number of Valor Points which can be earned in a week from any and all applicable dungeons and raids is now 980, down from 1250.<br />
<br />
The maximum number of Valor Points awarded for completing Rise of the Zandalari dungeons remains at 980.<br />
The maximum number of Valor Points awarded for completing Heroic dungeons remains at 490.<br />
The number of Valor Points awarded for killing a boss in the Firelands (http://db.mmo-champion.com/a/5802/) is 120 in 10-player mode, and 140 in 25-player mode.<br />
The number of Valor Points awarded for killing Occu'thar in Baradin Hold is 120 in 10-player mode, and 140 in 25-player mode.<br />

Dungeons &amp; Raids<br />
<br />
Raid Profiles have been added which allow players to save the raid window user interface layout based on type of content (i.e. 10-player raids, 25-player raids, Battlegrounds, etc.) for future use.<br />

This feature is available for 5-player content as well when Use Raid-Style Party Frames is selected in the Interface options.<br />

<br />
PvP Items &amp; Rewards<br />
<br />
Applicable Season 9 items now cost Honor Points (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/43308/).<br />
Gladiator Weapons<br />
<br />
Season 10 Conquest Point weapons will only be purchasable once a required minimum sum of Conquest Points has been reached during the current season. For example, Ruthless Gladiator's Pike (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/70225/) costs 3400 Conquest Points to purchase. However, players must first earn a total of 7800 Conquest Points during Season 10 before they are able to purchase it.<br />
Season 9 Honor Point weapons will only be purchasable once a required minimum sum of Honor Points (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/43308/) has been reached during the current season. For example, Vicious Gladiator's Pike (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/67451/) costs 3400 Honor Points (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/43308/) to purchase. However, players must first earn a total of 7250 Honor Points (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/43308/) during Season 10 before they are able to purchase it.<br />
Once the minimum sum of points required to purchase weapons is reached, all available weapons can be purchased for their listed costs. The point requirement is not reset once a purchase is made.<br />
Weapon tooltips from the vendor will let players know how many more Conquest or Honor Points (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/43308/) must be earned in the current season before the item can be purchased.<br />
<br />
Rated Battleground Rewards<br />
<br />
New PvP ground mounts, the Vicious War Wolf (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/100333/) (Horde) and Vicious War Steed (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/100332/) (Alliance), will be awarded to players for completing achievements to win 75, 150, and 300 Rated Battlegrounds respectively, rather than for being in the top .5% of the ladder at the end of each season as with Arenas. This award system is to better compliment the spirit of Battlegrounds. One account-bound mount will be awarded for each achievement unlocked, allowing players who obtain 150 and 300 Rated Battleground wins to earn this mount a second and third time. The additional mounts earned can then be sent to alt characters, given they're account-bound. These mounts are awarded as soon as an associated achievement is unlocked and do not correspond with end-of-season rewards.<br />
<br />
Set Bonuses<br />
<br />
The 2-piece resilience bonus from Cataclysm PvP sets no longer stacks. If a player wears 2 pieces each from 2 different Cataclysm sets, the player will only receive the 400 resilience rating bonus once. This change does not apply to PvP sets from prior expansions.<br />

Reforged off all the exp I could, problem is, since i use glyph of seal of truth for the 10 free expertise, i only use 2 gear pieces with expertise, and reforging them both i go down to 21, nothing i can do about it..

Maybe if you fail at the rotation or have crappy gear or something...I was doing about 4k-8k in heroics and raids on my Shaman (depending on the fight and whatnot) before patch and her gear was mostly 232 and a few 251s. Now I'm doing around 4-8k. <br />
<br />
At first I noticed a change in numbers, but that was mostly due to &quot;not having the hang of it&quot; and not reforging correctly (Mastery &gt; Crit/Haste) and I had not changed my gems from haste to agility, but that was a player error. Now I'm at about almost the same DPS with a few more upgrades and I enjoy Enhance even more than ever- it feels cleaner. Besides that, this content was tuned with 85 in mind, not 80, and we have not even gotten Unleashed Elements yet. I don't think Enhancement needs much more work, maybe a little more tweaking but it's not as bad as you say.<br />
<br />
Btw, as a Disc Priest I do 2-3k smiting. Is your DPS really that low or are you just immensely exaggerating?<br />

I thought my post was an obvious example of sarcasm. Of course we do better than disc priests smiting. I can easily do 10-11k dps, but compared to other dps classes that is insanely low. Most are hitting 15-16k without a problem. I know this is 80 and we're tuned to 85 and all that, but when Fury (or was it Arms) warrior dropped immensely after 4.0.1 hit, they shortly got hotfixed and are topping DPS meters again. Mages and few other classes were buffed/nerfed. But Enhancement shamans are just... there, untouched. Unless we really improve come 85 they need to fix it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have a feeling that they tweaked the numbers with balance at 85 in mind. The only changes reverted in the beta are the nerfs to mage damage, whereas most other changes on live were also and still are implemented there.<br />
<br />
Thing is, Enhancement is missing a key ability they can't learn yet. So is Arms, for example. Both specs are suffering right now. (The silver lining is that this puts those specs no worse off -- just similarly stagnant.) Fury, on the other hand, is not missing a key ability in their rotation and a result their damage is once again great (though somewhat humorously back to being a bit overpowered; blizz just can't get it right).<br />
<br />
I suppose that just means that Blizz is okay implementing temporary hotfixes to nerf the end-of-wrath OP specs to reasonable levels, but sees no incentive to buff classes that are 'fine' in Cata. Even if that's because of an ability you only get in Cata.</div></div><hr />

<br />
With the amount of fixes between cata beta's start (public wise) and now, is no one worried about how Blizzard go about testing and coming up with these &quot;estimate&quot; numbers?!<br />
<br />
in the past they've admitted they've failed (miserably without fixing it and just waiting until the &quot;next expansion&quot;, and even in whole talent trees (retribution paladins, for example) and they're still make weird mistakes. I really hope they adapt with their testing abilities, and the numbers they generate are you know tested properly.<br />

4.0.1 definately wasn't. what was worse is they removed the feedback ability from the PTR almost 2 weeks before it went live.</div></div><hr />

Frost DK made me LOL. I pull 23k DPS on an Unholy DK and 30k DPS on a Fury Warrior(which are severely overpowered); Enhancement is nowhere near those two. I know Frost Death Knights suck, but I don't know how Retribution Paladins are doing. Anyway, adding 30k DPS Fury Warriors in that sentence is the fallacy. Fix Shamans ya' morons.</div></div><hr />

Pre-sale at 7 December?!?!<br />
Pre-sale would be before that for me...<br />
Thats just a normal sale to me!<br />
<br />
That's not what it says. It says the accounts will be enabled one minute past midnight on December 7th.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'd prefer to just digitally download the game so I can play right from the time they turn the servers on, and then apply the pet with a code later once the game gets there in the mail. I could then give the extra physical copy of the game to a friend of mine that isn't quite as hardcore about wow as I am.

<br />
When you download this digital version, can you &quot;store it&quot; somehow, on a physicall support ? I mean does this digital version comes as a single file you can burn on any DVD ? Also do you get a Key ?<br />
<br />
My concern is that, say if I buy another computer, well I have Vanilla, BC and WOTKL on physical supports so Installing is easy, but what would happen with Cataclysm ? Would you need to download it again, using the key you received when you bought it maybe ? Or maybe you can just... somehow... copy/paste the whole WOW file on your original comp ?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mosene</div><div class="date">2010-10-29, 05:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Maybe if you fail at the rotation or have crappy gear or something...I was doing about 4k-8k in heroics and raids on my Shaman (depending on the fight and whatnot) before patch and her gear was mostly 232 and a few 251s. Now I'm doing around 4-8k. <br />
<br />
At first I noticed a change in numbers, but that was mostly due to &quot;not having the hang of it&quot; and not reforging correctly (Mastery &gt; Crit/Haste) and I had not changed my gems from haste to agility, but that was a player error. Now I'm at about almost the same DPS with a few more upgrades and I enjoy Enhance even more than ever- it feels cleaner. Besides that, this content was tuned with 85 in mind, not 80, and we have not even gotten Unleashed Elements yet. I don't think Enhancement needs much more work, maybe a little more tweaking but it's not as bad as you say.<br />
<br />
Btw, as a Disc Priest I do 2-3k smiting. Is your DPS really that low or are you just immensely exaggerating?<br />
<br />
Sidenote: Yay, I get to reforge another 3 expertise off my Shaman's gear!<br />
<br />
Maybe you someday learn to play and don't challenge players that have been playing enhancement shaman more than 4 years already. The burst in pvp is random so it is not reliable and in pve if you ever done heroic ICC you would see that the enhancement shamans are 5-6k dps behind other hybrid classes. So please do not claim that the old enhancement shaman players don't know to play (I bet you like it now just because you had a hard time before 4.0.1 to do some nice dmg because you failed the priority list)</div></div><hr />

If all the previous WoW Collector's Editions were an indicator (with the exception of TBC perhaps, where they messed this up in Europe), the game key included in the box will upgrade your account straightaway to a Collector's Edition account; there will not be any separate code really.</div></div><hr />

His replies have been withouth thought, care or consideration. His arragant attitude, i'll informaed comments and lack of empathy is outstadning.<br />
All i read from him is that we Enhancement do not know what we are doing.... <br />
He's ignored some extremely dedicated, knowledgeable beta testers (and others) - and blamed us for being inept (where ave we heard that before!)<br />
<br />
Truth be told, they have ignored 90% of the shaman feedback, suggestions and requests...once again done little to address huge concerns like the totems system, lack of &quot;o shite button&quot; and burst. Now they are ignoring clear, obvious and documented facts in parses and saying its going to be alright at 85<br />
<br />
Good job swifty showed the great burst potential on his latest video... oh wait, he was unable to find an enhance!!<br />
Obvioulsy swifty showed pvp burst.... stated he was worried that warriors had too much dps...... <br />
<br />
And dont enhance scale badly??<br />
Warriors scale well?<br />
....so... wha's he saying... in greens/blues we are both comparable at 85....<br />
wish i could believe were fine at 85... must admit i am a little dubious that when we are in epics we are going to be coparable to dps warriors</div></div><hr />

Shaman dps as high as fury, feral, ret dps? no way... when you look at the source, ghostcrawler says, that he saw enh shamans increasing their dps for 2k on festergut? wtf? post that shaman, because that cant be... I've been pulling 17,5k on 3.3.5, and now, after 4.0.1 im cant do more than 15,7k...<br />
<br />
it can be true, that on lower gear levels enh shaman gained some dps. But in high end gear levels enh shamans lost 1-3k dps on encounters...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Q. In what regions is the Cataclysm pre-sale available? What day/time is Cataclysm launching in my region?<br />
A. The pre-sale is available in the following regions, with realms scheduled to launch at the following times:<br />
<br />
Americas , Australia, New Zealand, and Southeast Asia - December 7 at 12:01 a.m. PST Europe and Russia - December 7 at 12:01 a.m. CET<br />
<br />

<br />
In the screenshot above from the original post it says &quot;Play Cataclysm at midnight on December 7th (EST).&quot;<br />
<br />
Is there some way to get a confirmation on which one is correct?<br />
<br />
The reason it's an issue for me is that I already have the Collector's Edition pre-ordered and paid in full, but if I can get the game pre-installed and be playing at midnight eastern time (my time zone), I'll just buy the regular version online and pick up my Collector's Edition the following day or whatever. If I have to wait until midnight PST (3 a.m. my time) then I'll just go pick up my Collector's Edition at midnight from Gamestop and not have to worry about missing out on play time.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's a lot more probable if they (for the first time ever) don't stagger the release based on time zones. WotLK launch was fine, but there was a stagger. Login servers especially are going to be raped if the whole US is trying to log on at 3 a.m. EST.</div></div><hr />
