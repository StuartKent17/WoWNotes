Good allies are hard to find, but don’t worry—we’ve got you covered in Battle for Azeroth. Meet two new Allied Races that will become available over the course of your adventures in the new expansion, the Dark Iron dwarves and Mag’har orcs, and learn a bit about the racial traits currently in development.<br />
<br />
Alliance: Dark Iron Dwarves<br />
Known for their fiery tempers and fierce determination, Dark Iron dwarves have a turbulent history with the other clans. A failed coup in Ironforge ignited the War of the Three Hammers, and many of the Dark Iron once fought in the service of Ragnaros the Firelord. Though one faction is pledged to Queen-Regent Moira Thaurissan, others refuse to stand alongside their kin. The Alliance seeks a united Dark Iron clan to harness the power of Azerite and aid their struggle against the Horde.<br />

Horde: Mag’har Orc<br />
For untold generations, the orc clans of Draenor battled one another in endless war. But when Gul'dan offered them the blood of his demonic masters, the disparate tribes of Mag'har—the orcish word for &quot;uncorrupted&quot;—refused the dark bargain and banded together to drive out the Burning Legion. United under the leadership of Grommash Hellscream, the Mag'har pledged to one day repay Azeroth's heroes for aiding their cause. As war against the Alliance intensifies, the Horde must call upon the might of the Mag'har to seize victory.<br />

Volunteer Guard Dayvgd<br />
Volunteer Guard Day (http://www.wowdb.com/world-events/635-volunteer-guard-day) allows you to help defend your faction's city and take on the appearance of a guard.<br />
<br />
<br />
Approach any guard in your faction's city and /salute them<br />
<br />
Alliance: Stormwind, Ironforge, Darnassus, The Exodar, Stormshield<br />
Horde: Orgrimmar, Thunder Bluff, Undercity, Silvermoon, or Warspear<br />
<br />
You will take on the appearance of the guard you interacted with, along with a 24H Volunteer City Guard (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/231193-volunteer-city-guard) buff.<br />
While you have the buff, City Invaders will spawn when you are in town and attack you. Defeat them to increase your kill count.<br />
Killing 10 attackers adds the &quot;Defender of X&quot; to your buff, 50 for &quot;Heroic Defender&quot;, and 250 for &quot;Mythic Defender&quot;. This doesn't appear to have any actual effect.<br />
This buff persists through death and changing of zones, but will be lost when entering an instance.<br />
You can get the buff back again by saluting a guard. Losing the buff will not reset your kill counter.<br />
<br />

It's kinda an old part of their culture.<br />
<br />
There were Dark Dwarves before Ragnaros was summoned. The Dark Iron clan actually diverged from the great, original Ironforge Clan. They already made contact with the humans and their Holy Light.<br />
<br />
They were named Dark Dwarves because of the skin color and their existence in the shadow of the mountains of Khaz Modan, not because they were evil or dabbed in dark arts.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You're assuming they're called Dark Iron because they're evil (which they are not all like that) but they didn't always serve Ragnaros and they're called Dark Iron because they are masters of dark iron ore which is mined deep from within the core of Azeroth. While mining that deep they ended up breaching into Ragnaros' lair (think of a rip off of what happened to the dwarfs in Lord of the Rings when they woke up the balrog). So they can wield the light just like ANYONE in Azeroth can if they choose to do so. You can even get a Night Elf Paladin as a follower in the Paladin Class Hall which is a race/class combo not even available to players because it's typically not something Night Elfs do but it is possible.<br />
<br />
Also Dark Iron dwarfs have been Paladins since the game released and lore wise were able to be Paladins before they served Ragnaros.</div></div><hr />

I'm not even a big fan of alliance in a general sense, but even I recognize how utterly and completely badass a Dark Iron Deathknight would be. I mean...this character already looks good as it is. Add deathknight to that? Pfffff....I might actually play a dwarf for the first time ever. <br />

<br />
Blizzard doesn't use traditional DnD rules for paladins requiring lawful good alignment. In the Warcraft universe, a paladin is only required to have strong conviction in a faith, regardless of what that faiths alignment may be.</div></div><hr />

If it works anything like the Eagle Network we will be able to fly much faster but will go to every flight path under the sun, fly over our intended destination for a round trip of the fp's we have gathered on Kul'Tiras and then make our way back to where we wanted to go.....faster to run.</div></div><hr />

The &quot;dark&quot; in their name is not mean &quot;evil&quot;, like &quot;dark side of the Force&quot;, but most probably because their culture heavily deals with.... *drums roll*... the dark iron metal that exists in Azeroth only around where those dwarves live.</div></div><hr />

HA. Blizzard has shown that they don't care about lore nearly as much as people want to believe. Just look at all of their retcons. <br />

<br />
&quot;in an expansion we can't fly&quot;<br />
<br />
The past 2 expansions have worked exactly as such:<br />
<br />
- No flying until a post-launch patch unlocks the requirements (achievements/reputations)<br />
- Once completed, unlock is account-wide<br />
<br />
Not being able to fly, is a temporary thing. It's not permanent.</div></div><hr />

They really have to change the DK starting experience. Make it about current DKs raising current fallen, rather than the Lich King narrative. DKs haven't had new races available to them in way too long.<br />

I think it just means Mag'har are incredibly retarded, I mean they are stupid enough to let Grommash lead them after he threatened half of them with death if they didn't join the iron horde and then killed a bunch of the ones that refused to join. The fact that the Frost wolves, Draenei, Shadowmoon, etc... Let the guy that lead the rapes/killings of their people build up another massive group of orcs shows that they all have IQs under 40. Probably even lower if the Frost wolves joined them.</div></div><hr />

Have you been living under a rock for the past decade? Blizzard has always had a bias for the Horde. In fact, they've had their heads stuck up the Horde's ass for so long that they perpetually smell like Thrall's smelly Green Jesus turds!<br />
Now you know how us Alliance players have felt for so long. Deal with it, snowflake!</div></div><hr />

Secondly I picked one racial that was laughable when really like McNeil says &quot; their racials pale in comparison to that of the dark iron dwarves&quot; I mean pet health increase? really? when pets no longer take aoe dmg, and most classes with pets will be able to summon a &quot;tank&quot; pet. Its not only useless to the pet classes, which correct me if I am wrong the Mag'har only have 1 maybe 2 classes that count (hunter,mage)but to most classes of Mag'har orcs. Thirdly DI get an empower and dispel in one racial, while our new orc friends have theirs not only split up but the dispel is lacking as-Savage Blood: Poisons, diseases, and curses affect Mag’har orcs for a shorter duration. Only &quot;shortens&quot; the duration of SOME debuffs...but does not remove debuffs.</div></div><hr />

And what exactly stops Alliance from taking the AU Draenei in now?<br />
Also, why would Draenor orcs join a war on another world when they pledged lasting peace with the Draenei after the events of HFC? Now they're fine with killing them again? Why are they only aiding Horde if both Horde and Alliance helped them there?<br />
How the fuck are any of Blizzard writers still employed?</div></div><hr />

Give me a break. After they shoved Green Jesus down our throats for years and the way Horde fantards constantly ridiculed Alliance players at Blizzcon ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGsNsSX-iO0 ) on top of the horribly skewed imbalances between the factions. I'm glad Blizzard are doing everything they can to take a shit on the Horde and make the Alliance look more favorable.<br />
Oh yeah! Alliance has such OP racials! So tell me why are so many of the top raiding guilds on WoWProgress on the Horde? Hell, Method used to be an Alliance guild years ago until they all faction changed.<br />
Fuck the Horde!</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Loeko</div><div class="date">2018-04-29, 10:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Funny, when it comes to PvP, it's the complete opposite but not that you care, eh. This &quot;Alliance/Horde is better and I don't like it&quot; comments war is completely stupid. Yes, there are only 20% Alliance guilds in the raid world top 100. Yes, there are more than 50% humans in the top 100 PvP. The Horde has OP dps racials and Alliance has OP utilities so yes, Alliance racials are not the best for raiding but the fact is that there is nothing stopping you from reaching the top world, the same way some Horde players manage to reach world top PvP without the human racials.<br />
<br />
The fact is that for 99.999% of the players, racials won't change a thing in PvE. The only reason to complain about the Horde racials being OP is if you're aiming for a first world kill and that only concerns a couple of hundred players. Outside of that, you won't have any problem finishing all the mythic content. It's not like you can't kill Argus Mythic because you're Alliance... But somehow, it became a trend to just whine after the Horde racials when for most of the people complaining, getting these actual racials wouldn't change a damn thing when you see the content they do.<br />
<br />
IMHO, the Alliance racials actually have a lot more impact in the game (and I play a human ret) has their utilities shine a lot more in PvP and have much more influence of fights outcomes. That is more likely to be experienced by a higher number of players (both ranked or casual) than just the few hundreds who feel like it's better to be Horde if they want to beat Method.</div></div><hr />

Right, because we weren't force fed Bolvar and Tyrion and other loladins in, for example, WOTLK. Right.<br />
<br />
<br />

They've been doing exactly that since at least BC, silly. And it went into full swing with the introduction of EMFH, which managed to single-handedly ruin the PVP balance for several expansions.<br />
<br />
<br />

Aside from the Throne of Thunder episode where beastslayer reigned supreme, the reason Horde had more PVE guilds is purely related to player population and has nothing to do with the racials. OTOH, PVP racials completely skewed the balance in favor of Alliance for several expansions, and we still see its effects to this day.<br />

I saw somewhere that more than 60% of all lf draenei characters are paladins. That says everything.<br />
<br />
Highmountain tauren have good warrior racials, but i think that no class of them has success as the paladins had on Lf draenei.<br />
<br />
Void elves and nightborne are better for casters and these had a lot of success.<br />
<br />
I guess the class blizzard wanted to focus for maghar was hunter. Time will tell which class will be more popular. And i also agree that maghar racials are bad. They should have something related to the iron horde, as they all passed through that phase</div></div><hr />

Lightforged Draenei very recently held the title for Worst Racials in an Allied Race, so maybe the pendulum swings back and forth...?<br />

I guess you never played the &quot;The Lost Vikings&quot; which was developed in 1992. It was the game that started the company (Silicon &amp; Synapse later Chaos Studios) that came to be named Blizzard Entertainment. I played &quot;The Lost Vikings&quot; and it was a favorite of mine. When I first played WOW I noticed that the dwarves reminded me of the Vikings with the humor and appearances. I believe Blizzard has a soft heart for dwarves.</div></div><hr />

It's not about beliefs. One has to look at PVP ladders back in EMFH times (from patch 3.0.2 until legion prepatch - that's from 2009 until 2016) to confirm the hypothesis of it being OP. And that's just one example, I won't elaborate on other things like stoneform and shadowmeld who were very powerful as well (FD/shadowmeld and shadowmeld/flightform say hi).</div></div><hr />
