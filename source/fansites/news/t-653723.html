The rusted and ironbound proto-drake rewards for the normal and heroic Glory of the Ulduar Raider meta achievements will be removed at a future date. We currently do not have an exact date they will be taken out, but it is possible they will be removed when patch 3.2 comes out or at some point after that. When we do decide to remove these mounts we will provide about 1 month of warning so players will have time to make some final attempts.<br />
<br />
These mounts are designed similar to the Arena Gladiator mounts as rewards for the top tier of raiders and we will remove the rewards once we have introduced enough new and more powerful equipment to make the completion of these achievements easier than originally intended. Since these rewards are designed for such high-end game play, we currently plan to continue removing any similar rewards we make available in the future. <br />
<br />
Argent Crusader's Coliseum<br />
The time to strike at the heart of the Scourge is drawing close. Clouds blanket the skies of Azeroth and heroes gather beneath battle-worn banners in preparation for the coming storm. They say even the darkest cloud has a silver lining. It is this hope that drives the men and women of the Argent Crusade: hope that the Light will see them through these trying times, hope that good will triumph over evil, hope that a hero blessed by the Light will come forth to put an end to the Lich King's dark reign.<br />
<br />
So the Argent Crusade has sent out the call, a call to arms for all heroes far and wide, to meet at the very doorstep of the Lich King's domain and to prove their might in a tournament the likes of which Azeroth has never seen. Of course, a tournament such as this needs a fitting stage. A place where potential candidates are tested to the limits of exhaustion. A place where heroes... become champions. A place called the Crusaders' Coliseum. <br />
<br />
Prove Your Might<br />
The Crusaders' Coliseum, a new raid set to open its doors once World of Warcraft's next content patch is released, will see you and your friends facing off against a series of increasingly challenging bosses, terrible monsters the Argent Crusade brought in from all over Northrend. Although the challenge is great, you will find that the prizes the Argent Crusade has to offer will make it all well worth your while.<br />
<br />
The setup for the Crusaders' Coliseum is surprisingly straightforward. If you are familiar with the Ring of Blood quest line, you already have a vague idea of how the Crusaders' Coliseum plays out in principle. After you and your friends enter the coliseum, you will face the first of several bosses; once you've defeated a boss, you will move on to the next one. You must master the encounters one by one, until you finally face the raid's final challenge. Sound simple? That's because there is a twist.<br />
<br />
In the &quot;Heroic&quot; version of the Crusaders' Coliseum, you and your raid only have a limited number of attempts for each raid lockout period, and each time your raid wipes, one of your attempts will be used up. To embark on the epic Trial of the Grand Crusader, you must first prove your worth by clearing either the 10 or 25 player version of the Crusaders' Coliseum's normal mode. After you have dealt the killing blow to the coliseum's final heroic mode boss will you be able to collect the Crusaders' Tribute, and the fewer attempts you needed to complete the Trial of the Grand Crusader, the better your reward will be.<br />
<br />
Meet (some of) the Bosses<br />
Beasts: Your first challenge will pit you against a group of terrifying beasts the Argent Crusade captured in Northrend, including (but not limited to) a magnataur and not one, but two jormungar wyrms.<br />
Scourge: Some call the lieutenants of the Lich King fearsome creatures made of pure nightmare, which is doubtlessly a fitting description. How the Argent Crusade managed to capture these fiends remains a mystery; what's less mystifying is your fate should you fail to overcome this challenge.<br />

Seems similarly fair to me. Blizzard is going to have to figure out something different at some point, because I can't use 4 mounts at once and the old ones are just turning into old-tier raid trash of a different variety, but at least they're phasing out rewards that are of no function.</div></div><hr />

All of 33 guilds have earned this achievement to date world wide. It is clearly an easy achievement to get thanks to over nerfing the content.<br />

At least this time people will have less reason to go &quot;zomg you didn't tell me ahead of time so I could actually put effort into hardmodes!!!!&quot; like they did when 3.1 launched. They still will...but now blues can kindly point them to a post from a month back.</div></div><hr />

Crusader's Coliseum? Meh. WotLK version of Hyjal. Unconfirmed if there will be or won't be any trash, but it's the same concept. Same patch that epic gems debuted, same patch where Arena totally took the turn for the worst. Anyone else getting deja vu?</div></div><hr />

Except the ZG mounts aren't and weren't measurements of skill like the ones they're removing. I took 2 characters to exalted with Zandalar during vanilla and saw a total of 3 tiger mounts drop. In a raid group of 20 they were virtually impossible to obtain - unlike these ones which are rewarded to every single member of the raid.</div></div><hr />

I had a feeling about the mechanics ahead of time, just because of the way that it seemed to be going. When you think of the word &quot;coliseum&quot;, you think of the ancient Roman and Greek days. The days of warriors fight other warriors, and beasts inside an open air coliseum, with hundreds and thousands of spectators in attendance. <br />
<br />
Also, as you quested throughout both BC and WotLK, you came across the Ring of Blood and the Ampitheater of Anguish. I am sure alot of us liked that set up. So, why not apply it on a larger scale. <br />
<br />
Thank you, Blizzard! I like this change!</div></div><hr />

<br />
They can easily change the achievement to limit the itemlevel with which we can get the achievement. &quot;but the talent tree will change anyway&quot; you say? They can save that talent tree, make it so that we can choose between a couple of talent trees, for example: Glory of the raider talent tree and glory of the ulduar raider talent tree (hell, they can even get the vanilla WOW tree and TBC tree since they introduce an option to block the XP you gain). That way people can choose their challenge and not be dictated their pleasures.<br />

But nah, I doubt this will happen. Blizzard is just to stuck-up about what kind of game they want to force onto their player base, eradicating all the freedom and options of the game in the process.<br />

The Glory rewards are meant for HARDCORE players only. It's that simple. Are you also seriously suggesting the Blizz set aside an entire talent tree just for the achievements? Seriously?<br />

Just kidding, I couldn't resist that one.<br />
<br />
I see the reasoning behind this and it's okay with me. I also think the new instances sound like a lot of fun and fit in well with the Coliseum theme. As far as Ulduar being over-nerfed, I have to disagree. The only boss that might be true for is Flame Leviathan. The next 5 are fine but the keepers are still very difficult. My guild has downed them all in 10 man but has managed only Thorim so far in 25. The achievement to get the drake rewards is extremely hard and I salute anyone who manages it.</div></div><hr />

Why? ZG mounts are random drops, they are not guaranteed like the Drake or Arena rewards. Every player has a 0.001% chance of getting a ZG mount when they kill the bosses that drop them.</div></div><hr />

Not exactly. Remember, they did refer to the Ring of Blood / Ampitheather of Anguish for the premise for the Crusader's Coliseum. There would be no mob encounters in between the boss encounters. Just strictly boss encounters.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Like, after a few bouts the Lich King turns up with Dark Knight (aka Kael'thas) and he blasts apart the arena and takes the control away from the Argent Dawn. To be fighting monsters captured by your allies in return for them giving you gear is totally not epic and feels really 'safe' rather than scary. <br />
<br />
There'd better be some lore in this patch! At the moment it just feels like an idea someone had in the last few months, not way back in WOTLK development, like you'd expect raids to be.</div></div><hr />

In the &quot;Heroic&quot; version of the Crusaders' Coliseum, you and your raid only have a limited number of attempts for each raid lockout period, and each time your raid wipes, one of your attempts will be used up. To embark on the epic Trial of the Grand Crusader, you must first prove your worth by clearing either the 10 or 25 player version of the Crusaders' Coliseum's normal mod pallies e. After you have dealt the killing blow to the coliseum's final heroic mode boss will you be able to collect the Crusaders' Tribute, and the fewer attempts you needed to complete the Trial of the Grand Crusader, the better your reward will be.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
What will constitute a raid wipe? Sounds like a stupid question but does that mean every time the boss is reset? Because bosses reset randomly - KT has done it on me a few times. If not and it just needs everyone to die; does this mean that a rogue vanishing or a hunter feigning death or a Pally's divine intervention will avoid the a raid wipe and therefore not lose group's attempt?</div></div><hr />

After all, if this whole thing is just 5 bosses (or a rotating cast of 5 bosses total) and its supposed to be its own tier, then that's it, right? Or is this supposed to be a ZA-style content patch where everything is sidegrades?<br />
<br />
Regardless, I know I cannot be the only one who thinks this is incredibly lame, especially as a follow-up to Ulduar. We've had a recycled Naxx, fresh new Ulduar, and now recycled 5-man quests? GC has said Diablo 3 and Starcraft 2 weren't a drain on Blizzard resources, but seriously? Very lame.</div></div><hr />

Also, judging by the way bliz has been thinking lately, there won't be trash, if there is, very minimal. Remember, Bliz wants you to have a life and still geared to the teeth.

You seem to laboring under the delusion that someone has announced that there will be exactly 5 bosses and they won't change between the instances. I will bet all my level 80s that there isn't going to be a standard 5. I mean, think logically.

A lot of the BC assets were already existing in the source code during Vanilla - just like there's some Emerald Dream assets still in there - while they had to make Wrath from scratch while releasing content for BC.<br />
I also wouldn't call it &quot;laziness&quot;, but it's not just for lore that the majority of Wrath's raiding content on release was recycled when they had to build the rest of the world from the ground-up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Like, after a few bouts the Lich King turns up with Dark Knight (aka Kael'thas) and he blasts apart the arena and takes the control away from the Argent Dawn. To be fighting monsters captured by your allies in return for them giving you gear is totally not epic and feels really 'safe' rather than scary. <br />
<br />
There'd better be some lore in this patch! At the moment it just feels like an idea someone had in the last few months, not way back in WOTLK development, like you'd expect raids to be. <br />
<br />
It WAS an idea they had in the past few months...the initial plan for the &quot;secret&quot; 3.2 raid and how it was changed goes as follows:<br />
<br />
Blizzard, in their infinite wisdom, decides that they want ANOTHER TROLL INSTANCE. This one will be slightly unique because there will be some type of snow troll...god...thing.<br />
<br />
Players, upon hearing they're keeping one of the raids a secret in the progression path, along with the ominous temple in Zul' Drak, discover their plan<br />
<br />
The players begin to complain, and moan, and beg blizzard to NOT MAKE ANOTHER TROLL INSTANCE !!!!!111!!!1!ELEVEN!!1<br />
<br />
Blizzard goes, &quot;well crap, our very intelligent fallback seems to be something that will fail miserably, maybe we should change what it will be&quot;<br />
<br />
for once, blizzard changes something based on feedback, but then they realize they have no fresh ideas for content.<br />
<br />
one employee goes, &quot;well people seemed to like the ring of blood for leveling, maybe we do something like that?&quot;<br />
<br />
everybody agrees because of how quick it would be to create, and how they could develop generic fights with no significance to the lore that can be pushed out so they can keep collecting monies until they release Icecrown.<br />
<br />
At this point, one of the employees realized &quot;well if we just randomly throw it in, people will suspect we changed it&quot;<br />
<br />
Another came up with the idea &quot;hey, we'll introduce it in 3.1, where you have to help build the thing, then we will look like we planned it all along MUAHAHAHA&quot;<br />
<br />
And thus, the Coliseum raid was created.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In all fairness though I do think this new raid content is possibly one of the biggest clutching at straws blizz has ever produced to delay the release of what I believe will be the last patch of meaning, after icecrown I think we can all expect a few more patches of Arena content and more epic nerf's to classes that the developers struggle to beat in PvP with their rogues. Then there will be the invasion of the trolls that has yet to appear on northrend. If they wanted to spice things up why not have a murlock raid and how come there isn't a gnome bashing raid for people to really vent their frustrations in.<br />
<br />
Back to the colluseum though, if the line &quot;not 1 but 2 jormunger worms&quot; doesn't smack of desperation i don't know what does. there is a lot of opportunity for some quite intresting fights in their, like chariot combat but I don't think blizz have thought of that and it does appear to me to be a case of throwing the christians to the lions, if it does turn out to be something special I will show my arse in Tesco's window.</div></div><hr />

And I could care less about drakes, the protodrakes are hideous (model is too big and it's just damn ugly). I'll take my windrider anyday. ;D</div></div><hr />

Don't nerf mimiron any further, remove drakes in 3.2.<br />

Not to say the way they are presenting it isn't dumb but the idea could actually have some cool things come along with it--if put together well..<br />
<br />
rankings.... maybe pull old bosses from old raids.. lil C-thun action or rag.. just random things like that would make things interesting..<br />
<br />
I mean for the ppl that actually does arena this is most likely not going to be of any interest.. but for the ppl who despise pvp.. they will have fun with this.. Well if it was actually cool fights and not 2 EPIC WYRMS (so we do agree on that part).</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't. Sure if they pay back money to those who us who now can't get it then fine. Otherwise leave it alone.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Wow, aren't you an elitist prick. I know adults with lives who have been playing Lich king since it was released, who haven't even reach level 80 yet. Not because they are morons, but because they have lives and can't just grind around the clock.<br />
<br />
If 5 million people had that achievement you could possibly call it easy.</div></div><hr />
