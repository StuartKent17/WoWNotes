<br />
This is why leveling is a thing. While lvling you have plenty of time to find out if the class suits you. Instead of realizing that they made a mistake of boosting a class they dont know anything about, they demand the game to adapt to them. And this is the everlasting circle that keeps the game from staying true to the character progression and MMO aspect of the game where things should be intended to take some time.<br />
<br />
Before the flame, this isnt a fact, this is just my opinion. :)<br />

Most likely badly worded, as in there will be 3 tiers, divided into 4 raids, where two are available in 7.0.</div></div><hr />

That way of doing it works better with the wardrobe, given how the hiding would for the most part, if not entirely done on a per-outfit basis.<br />

So far Knowledge seems to only affect your character's other specs rather than alts, so I was starting to get worried about my stable of characters I'll be leaving until later in the expansion.<br />
<br />
Now I'm just hoping the Order Hall Campaigns aren't too long for alts, depending on how exactly those are progressed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Seriously though, the future content sounds exciting but i'm not going to get hyped for it until it's OFFICIALLY announced.<br />
<br />
Any news for mages with Ice Barrier? Any glyphs or something that change the colour of it for other specs(fire&amp;arcane)?<br />
<br />
If anything, they should remove Ice Barrier from these specs. All mages having access to Barrier+Block+Cauterize (with speed proc in Legion) and blink+ice floes is a big fucking joke.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Another stat squish is coming in the next expansion.&quot;<br />

8.0, after legion.</div></div><hr />

If more dungeons will be added in patches or not is not something they are talking about right now. They aren't willing to say that no more are coming and they aren't willing to rule it out.<br />

Dungeons will be released throughout the patch cycle.<br />

FFXIV:ARR are getting more content patches and updates then wow is having at this point of time which is very sad indeed (cause this is blizz's cash cow but overwatch may take that mantle now). i still hate the &quot;class halls&quot; *cough* garrison 2.0 *cough*. im still very unsure about where i stand on the expac of legion. love some stuff hate more of it tho</div></div><hr />

Well they never were good at giving coherent and sensible answers to anything :D So why should they start now, they said both. So they have an excuse when they don't do new dungeons and get praised by the white knights if they do. Win-Win-Lies :)</div></div><hr />

Well, there's one thing the german Fansite Vanion asked, answered &quot;Das Konzept der titangeschmiedeten Items, soll auch in World Quests weiter beibehalten werden. So kann dort eine Belohnung unter Umständen sogar auf 885 angehoben werden.&quot;<br />

<br />
So World Quest rewards scale with itemlevel AND can proc titanforged? So if a already am at ~850 iLevel, the reward would be ~850 + possible titanforge, so a 925 item from a world quest (best case)?</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;In Legion, professions are geared more towards the players that really love getting invested in professions.&quot;<br />
<br />
Blizzard never was good as balancing things they only go from one extreme to the other.<br />
In WoD everybody could farm everything, so now you mostly farm for yourself.<br />
<br />
Instead of: Trading is a vital part of professions. Find someone who really loves gathering but hates crafting, and have him supply you while you supply him with crafting items or a share of the revenue. And the 1 gathering 1 crafting profession being a midway, they make it the only way.</div></div><hr />

The question would be if it has a cap. I instantly stop playing wow if every idiot can obtain ilvl 900 from the get go doing nothing other than a 5 min world quest.</div></div><hr />

<br />
as far as we know, since they don't talk about this major thing ever, there is no cap. A mythic iLevel 900 item could roll to be a 975 item for all we know. And people on the beta got 885 items from the world quests... so with the rewards scaling to current ilevel I would say: Hello Insane ItemLevels. I bet someone will get an item with an itemlevel over 1000 before the second tier launches, if world quests scale endlessly...</div></div><hr />

<br />
My hype was justified, I like the things they are doing with patches, and I hope it will be as good as they say it is, to me the most important thing in game is having to be doing something, it seems they really got that memo, and patches will bring in new things to do in between the new raid patches, like dungeons.

A mythic iLevel 900 item could roll to be a 975 item for all we know. And people on the beta got 885 items from the world quests... so with the rewards scaling to current ilevel I would say: Hello Insane ItemLevels. I bet someone will get an item with an itemlevel over 1000 before the second tier launches, if world quests scale endlessly...<br />
<br />
Of course there is a cap on how high it can scale.. Are you retarded?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Any proof? In the interview with Vanion titanforged could go up to +80 ilevels. There is no definite cap mentioned for World Quests, all we know is:<br />
&quot;The quests currently list rewards like &quot;item level 810+&quot; with the item level being determined by your current item level.&quot; (so if you are at iLevel 900, you get around iLevel 900 rewards)<br />
&quot;The rewards offered by world quests will keep scaling up with your item level, up to heroic dungeons, then mythic dungeons, but beyond that we will have to see.&quot;<br />
So they don't know yet if they need a cap(!)<br />
<br />
So +80 iLevels on currently an uncapped reward structure.</div></div><hr />

I am a bit annoyed at this as well. My plan was to focus myhtic+ dungeons and only raid casually in normal/heroic if I felt like it.

I personally don't mind not being able to buy gear with VP/JP, but I am annoyed that Raiding will be mandatory to even remotely be competitive in the Mythic + scene, something which will be content for the entire expansion.

<br />
Yay, just one more raid than WoD and one less raid than MoP, both expansions known for their gigantic content droughts which resulted in a wide player exodus.<br />
<br />
Glad to see our $14.99 per month subscription fee as well as the shitloads Blizzard makes from expansion sales and price-gouging players with expensive microtransactions like $30 realm transfers, $60 level boosts and $20 mounts are going somewhere, eh!<br />
<br />
<br />
There are solid plans for at least three content patches in Legion already.<br />
<br />
<br />
Improved social features won't be in at release, but hopefully soon afterwards.<br />
<br />
Sorry, but if you define a content patch as being 6.1, I'm not excited for that at all. I don't want the ability to duckface and pout in front of a selfie cam, communicate in emojis, take heavily narcissistic pictures of my Blood Elf Paladin's butt, or to put my pics on Instagram and Pinterest to be actual features in the game, thank you very much!<br />
<br />
Blizzard, why not give us improved social features that we actually wanted and which you promised FOUR YEARS AGO, like... erm.... Appear Offline mode on Battle.net? (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/blog/10015474/)<br />
<br />
<br />
The devs recognize that BRF came out too quickly and release pacing in Warlords wasn't great. There is a plan in place to make it better in Legion.<br />
<br />
It's not the pacing that was bad. It's the abhorrent lack of content. It's at the point where I wish everybody would have abandoned the game, supported a much more community focused MMO like Wildstar, and actually forced an apology from Blizzard over this. But you know, Blizzard never apologises!<br />
<br />
<br />
Another stat squish is coming in the expansion after Legion.<br />
<br />
Yay, another band-aid fix that will undoubtedly break the old content in the game! I can't wait to get one hit killed by over-tuned mobs, or for the greens that drop in Hyjal to be much better in stats than ilvl 725 Mythic HFC epics!<br />
<br />
And I'm pretty sure the Stat Squish took the devs so much work that we lost at least two raid tiers and Farahlon in Warlords...<br />
<br />
<br />
Dungeons will be released throughout the patch cycle.<br />
<br />
This is the only good news that I've found in this entire wall of text. Mists and Warlords had an abhorrent lack of instanced dungeon content, and no, I don't count the unrewarding, undertuned, mechanic-free slogfests that Scenarios were. If some of that effort went into new dungeons, Mists would have been a far better expansion pack.<br />
<br />
<br />
There is still room for improvement as far as having both tanks actively doing something rather than swapping back and forth.<br />
<br />
Six expansion packs later and they JUST realised this? Perhaps designing all your encounters around requiring two tanks wasn't such a good idea?<br />
<br />
<br />
The team won't say how many raid tiers are planned for Legion, but they weren't happy with how patches worked out for Warlords.<br />
<br />
Yay, another contradictory statement. That is unless the summary at the top of the page is BS...<br />
<br />
<br />
There are no plans to scale Wintergrasp and Tol Barad. There are problems just beyond scaling, such as how instanced world PvP works. The team would rather spend time trying something new rather than revisiting the past.<br />
<br />
And this kind of thinking, as well as the general inaccessibility of old content is why everybody's demanding legacy servers.</div></div><hr />

I assume he means people being able to buy boosts and the likes, and even if gold was very easy to get in Wod, you do have a massive advantage if you can dish out goldcaps whenever you feel like it. <br />
<br />
I still like the system how it is now, though. I don't see a good reason to change or expand it. Maybe extending the functionality to things like realm transfer or name changes, but that should be it.</div></div><hr />

Well most specs have had a lot of their utility gutted and their rotations simplified to an alarming extent.

<br />
A full set or several pieces, either way it's still pay-for-advantage.<br />
<br />
And in Legion PvP, ilvl = power.<br />
<br />
This is assuming the person who buys the gear is actually good and the mythic items in question are more than just boots, bracers, gloves and belts. It could just as well be bought by Johnny Goldfarmer who has a mountain of Garrison gold and likes shiny things even though he's behind the tank on damage in normal difficulty. <br />

Wildstar used backwards methodology in regards to their attunement chain for the sake of beating their chests about how hardcore it was. In reality, they were a mess of half-baked ideas which became more of a pain in the ass clusterfuck than an experience where the end ultimately did not justify the means. It didn't feel like I accomplished anything other than wasting way more time than I should have all for the sake of Carbine's inflated sense of #hardcore which did not rely on player skill but rather a stacked deck of bullshit 'I win' gimmicks, quests which made no sense, and mandatory downtime. <br />

Blizzard at least put effort in to their attunement chains. Some were incredibly long such as the Scepter of the Shifting Sands and others were short such as the one for Karazhan but all felt rewarding and kept you engaged since they were also interesting.</div></div><hr />

They're quite asinine for putting them back in. They're going to get the data back and realize all the dungeons have quick queue times and people wanting to do the attuned dungeons will be sitting in queue forever. I guarantee you they'll be removed quickly.<br />
<br />
They implied that the Suramar dungeons will be adjusted to a higher base ilvl than the others because of the attunement hurdle.<br />
<br />
What players want is typically everything handed to them with as little effort as possible. Blizz is right not to give them this all the time.</div></div><hr />

The problem is half the PVPer's want a good skill based match.<br />
The other half wants to farm powerful PVP gear so they can out gear 99% of the PVE population(and noob PVPers) and just destroy them in fights with gear alone.<br />
<br />
So taking away the extreme gear advantage has made a decent amount of the PVP'ers upset.<br />

The changes will make it better, more equalized, playing field - and that scares the scrubs who needed the gear advantage to be 'good'.</div></div><hr />

5mans being relevant throughout the expansion with ever-increasing challenges, <br />
world quests always having a possibility of an upgrade so they remain relevant, <br />

and factions that has rep rewards relevant to artifact and GEAR progression, not just toys<br />
And 3 god damn raid tiers again like it should be.<br />
<br />
So happy with what I'm reading here. It looks like they've learned their lessons from WoD, and whom to listen to. Players that wants everything served within an hour, or those that'll actually stay for more than a month. Frankly the only thing I'm a bit concerned about is that the 110 factions doesn't really seem to have any daily or weekly quests to flesh them out further, but I might have to dig deeper on Wowhead to be sure.<br />

And it doesn't matter that Maria Sharapova was doping because she's bad and keeps losing anyway.<br />
<br />
and the mythic items in question are more than just boots, bracers, gloves and belts. It could just as well be bought by Johnny Goldfarmer who has a mountain of Garrison gold and likes shiny things even though he's behind the tank on damage in normal difficulty. <br />
<br />
If anything, if you're worried about pay-for-advantage in PvP then you should be more concerned about whether or not Champion's Honor tokens return.<br />
Getting epics from gold obtained from Garrison is playing the game. Buying epics from gold bought with real money is a pay-for-advantage game.</div></div><hr />

The system in place of legion, gear&gt;skill. <br />
It will be like being a &quot;pvp season's/tier&quot; behind - the whole expansion, with no catchup mechanic. Unless you raid.<br />

And the first people that get the best pvp gear quickly will most certainly keep you from being able to get it regardless of how good you think you are.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The hell are you talking about? The issues with PvP in legion are many. For instance there will now be a gear gap between PvPers and PvErs with PvE being the best gear. They are adding no new PvP content outside of a PvP talent system which is being used as an excuse to remove skills from PvE, and so far is a bunch of must haves with useless talents sprinkled in. World PvP is going to be in its worst state its ever been with the coming expansion too. <br />
<br />
PvP in legion isnt good for anyone. Its nothing but dozens of steps back. I mean shit, what extreme gear advantage are you talking about in WoD? It takes what, a week to gear up for PvP? By which time the gap is almost none-existant aside from the easily reached conquest gear people? While in Legion there will be a gap in PvP that can only be bridged by mythic raiding and never resetting your talents to get the only rewards blizz sees fit to throw pvpers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So all of our Metamorphosis forms will look the same? At least in regards to horns and tattoos. That's a shame, but a graphical limitation that's fairly reasonable I suppose. What I really want to know is if skin colour will change in the form. My planned Demon Hunter has grayish skin, and the default Night Elf Metamorph form has purple skin. The contrast would drive me crazy if it doesn't change with my customization options..<br />
<br />
I've noticed the same issue with the Glide wings. They're purplish-red, which would just look out of place on my character. Ah well. I could always go purple, but I vastly prefer grey and silver Night Elves.<br />

<br />
So they give players who like Dungeons and Challenging Dungeons content. Those who prefer 5 man content above Raids (or can't commit to raids) yet those who wish to be competitive (ranking-wise) will have to Raid to get the Tier set bonusses and Trinkets. Reminds me of HFC where the Blademaster Trinket was mandatory to even be remotely competitive.<br />
So on the one end you give those who like that kind of content a chance to do it, yet on the other hand Raiders will again have an advantage just because they can play with 10 + people.<br />
Give a hand, but the wrist is broken ...<br />
<br />
You can play with 10+ people too. Jesus this is why WoW is its in the state it's in. No matter what they do someone is unhappy. Blizzard should just make the game they want to make and quit trying to appease everyone. Shit man vanilla and tbc were the biggest growth periods of WoW ever and that was when Blizzars didn't cater to everyone and their mom. And this isn't a casual or hardcore debate. That horse is dead and beaten. This is a thing where everyone feels like they deserve everything because they pay their monthly fee too. Which is bullshit.

They stated quite clearly that because Mythic+ is new and experimental they're just being cautious and are waiting to see how things play out. They did not say &quot;no, Mythic+ can never ever ever have tier or the best trinkets.&quot;<br />
<br />
For what it's worth, both systems are capable of complementing each other, so it's not like, for example, putting tier in LFR, where the content is an absurd step down in difficulty for a real guild but they need the set bonuses enough to feel compelled to do it. Loads of people in our guild are excited about doing Mythic+ on off-nights.</div></div><hr />

That is an interesting change from the default.<br />
You can only equip one legendary item at the start of the expansion. This limit will be increased as time goes on.<br />
The first tier is balanced around most players not having a legendary item.<br />
Some level of bad luck streak protection also applies to legendary items.<br />
Guess initially legendaries will turn into a min-max sort of thing until later in the expansion. <br />
If an item that drops via personal loot is the same or lower item level than what you have equipped, it will be eligible to be traded to other members in the raid.<br />
Well that was something that has been asked about since the features implementation.<br />
Holy will probably remain the main healing spec, with Discipline main healing up to base level Mythic dungeons and playing more of a support role in higher end content.<br />
Interesting the devs are coming outright with a stance about how they are going to balance the two specs. I dont expect many disc players to be happy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm not disagreeing that making a sequel is not particularly tied to a movie making a &quot;profit&quot; (however that is defined). Someone asked the question about why revenues had to be so much higher than what the movie cost. A lot of people apparently do not understand the relationship between ticket sales, expenses not associated with the filming and production of the movie, and what constitutes a profit. So a link to start them on the path to get informed. I'm not sure what your point is really.</div></div><hr />

Players will come to understand his father's more aggressive approach. He is a character the team really wants to build out.<br />

This is a surprise to literally nobody that is capable of critical thought and has realized since Cata what Blizzard's long game with Anduin was.

Not if it doesn't make a good chunk of profit it won't. Do you really think it's gonna make another $150-200m in the US? No way in hell. <br />

To be honest I can't really remember what it was WoW used from FF14, I know it was some minor things from early on during FF14s re-release. I assume people would say the artifact weapon chains are like the special weapon quests that FF had, but that shit isn't even close to the same and FF14s quests are N O T H I N G compared to Everquest's epic weapon quests from back in the day.</div></div><hr />

I didn't say the costs were different, I said the level of promotion was.

Maybe not in the initial weekend, but over time, it will easily profit. Once it hits iTunes, streaming, and disks, it will make another mountain of money, and then cable rights will be another mountain. Anyone who has a piece of this movie will make their money back and much, much more. <br />

One of the costs of promotion for this movie are the free WoW accounts. That has to be paid for. The showcases they made at the conventions were a good chunk of money. <br />
<br />
Money was spent - it's 2016, it's not just spent on TV and magazine ads anymore - newspaper ads for a movie like this are a complete waste - the audience that it's aiming for don't read newspapers.</div></div><hr />

I assume they keep the various ilvls for different bosses in. This is going to be annoying when ie. a trinket drops with higher ilvl but worse proc for your spec. They need to equalize the ilvls again if they don't want daily whine posts on the forums about this once raiding starts.<br />

<br />
More likely you'll be forced into cookie cutter builds like before. &quot;This set of talents is most often uses on bosses&quot; to make progression faster. I suspect only Mythic guilds during progression will hearth back for talent changes.<br />
<br />
So you won't, practically speaking, get &quot;interesting&quot; choices. You're going to get cookie cutter choices. It'll be &quot;enough&quot; of a hassle to not be worth caring about anymore unless it's worth an effort to change it (unlikely).<br />
<br />
Their point about Battlegrounds is right though -- but it's exactly why I went cookie cutter and never care anymore about &quot;options&quot; because I don't have options. I can't play fluidly and go &quot;this situation calls for this now, I should change&quot;. Instead I'm stuck.<br />
Much like I'm stuck if I can tank but and forced DPS but our tank just dropped. It's a great big &quot;fuck you&quot; that the dev's still haven't thought about.<br />

It's already made double what it cost to produce, and there is still plenty of time left. I think it's fair to say we'll be getting an Extended Edition, and a sequel. My guess is on Warcraft 2 hitting 2020.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, dont understand why the news is saying that they need to earn 500 million dollars to break even? The production cost of this movie was 160$ millions.</div></div><hr />

I don't understand how people still don't know this or even come up with the obvious explanation themself.<br />
<br />
The proceeds of ticket sales/revenue don't go all to the producer himself.<br />
<br />
Rule of thumb is only half goes to the producer on launch and it only drops over time.<br />
<br />
On top of that production cost for movies usually exclude any possible marketing by the producer himself.</div></div><hr />

That isn't how it works, box office is 290~ million, that has to be split up by various people actual theaters need their cut, the advertising etc. <br />
<br />
I don't know if the 500 million figure is correct but even if it was a 50/50 split they would still need 320 million to break even.</div></div><hr />

What they're saying is that the solution to content droughts isn't to add more content, but to split up the already tiny amount of existing content into more patches.</div></div><hr />

I suspect only Mythic guilds during progression will hearth back for talent changes.<br />
<br />
So you won't, practically speaking, get &quot;interesting&quot; choices. You're going to get cookie cutter choices. It'll be &quot;enough&quot; of a hassle to not be worth caring about anymore unless it's worth an effort to change it (unlikely).<br />
<br />
Their point about Battlegrounds is right though -- but it's exactly why I went cookie cutter and never care anymore about &quot;options&quot; because I don't have options. I can't play fluidly and go &quot;this situation calls for this now, I should change&quot;. Instead I'm stuck.<br />
Much like I'm stuck if I can tank but and forced DPS but our tank just dropped. It's a great big &quot;fuck you&quot; that the dev's still haven't thought about.<br />
<br />
But hey! At least casual play is still being discouraged!<br />
<br />
Yeah it's a real shame. what's even more nasty that you are not even stuck with it, you are actually able to swap talents for optimized play, its just inconvenient and a chore. Give's me the constant unpleasant feeling of &quot;i could do better in this situation, it would just cost me too much pointless and tedious effort, so i just underperform&quot;.<br />
<br />
I understand their point that its also not the best thing in the world to swap back talents back and forth all the time but well, players accepted it and got used to it.<br />
<br />
Me personally i only a single spec of my class, so i use the dual spec to swap between a cookie cutter single target talent build and cookie cutter multitarget talent build which i adjust in certain situations. Whenever i am in wrong spec for the wrong situation (because i forgot to switch or got into combat before being able to) it just feels like i totally fuck up.<br />
<br />
Yesterday i got a bad/unlucky first try on a mythic blackhand pug and got instantly kicked from group. In this game i got the feeling i need to perform as good as possible in so many situations, the game basically offers me ways to do so and then gates them behind inconvience and chores.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
This is very unlikey. The reason why i know this is because the beta at the moment has multiple profession quests that send you into Karazhan to kill bosses (like a skinning quest sends you into kill and skin Netherspite) so I cant see them adding these quests just to change the whole dungeon in a later patch. They have even said in this interview they dont want to redo old content.<br />
<br />
The crypt however has been altered drastically. If you look at this picture:<br />

<br />
.... you can see how the stairs that lead down to the crypt have been removed and there are green objects there. Also, the doorway has been blocked off with a gate, obviously to stop people going down and seeing what is down there or what changes they have done in that area so yeah, defo something exciting going on down there :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
Watched Final-Boss's video on Holy, and Disc and I just laughed hard at how HORRIBLE Disc spec was. Also the PROC for holy's Tuur-something Artifact thing was horribly low. But man DISC look likes an AFK spec now. Loved my druid restro spec :)<br />
<br />
Final Boss do shamans soon please :) I want to tell my friend he should main a druid not a sham-wow.<br />
<br />
The team talks about doing a MOBA style battleground at least several times a year. There is a learning curve for players that aren't familiar with all of the aspects of MOBA games, such as lanes and turrets. The team still isn't comfortable having so many aspects to a battleground, which is why all of the battlegrounds after Alterac Valley have had simple and focused goals<br />
<br />
TRUE, but people love that one, and winterlands? Wrath place cause of the siege and weirdness.</div></div><hr />

Your petty cynical hyperbolic wall of whining wasn't a coherent argument either.</div></div><hr />
