Kul Tiras was founded by fearless explorers who sailed uncharted waters in search of adventure. As a key member of the Alliance of Lordaeron, the Kul Tiran navy dominated the seas of Azeroth with its legendary fleet. But after years of turmoil and hardship, the kingdom grew isolated and vulnerable to dark influences. Thanks to the help of brave heroes, House Proudmoore has been restored and Kul Tiras is poised to fight alongside the valiant Alliance once more.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The Zandalari are a proud people whose origins date back to the early days of Azeroth's history. Their fierce warriors ride dinosaurs into battle, and they possess one of the most formidable naval fleets in the known world. But enemy attacks on their borders—as well as unrest within the king's council—have threatened the kingdom's foundations. By returning stability to Zandalar, the heroes of the Horde can gain a powerful new ally.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, that's a reasonable idea. It would've been a lot less jarring if they'd mentioned it beforehand though. Given the amount of water elementals the Kul'tirans have in Stormsong Valley and the fact that Jaina is the most prominent Kul'tiran NPC, it seems more than a bit strange.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
There are loads of Zandalari priests. Talanji, for one. Troll mages are pretty standard. There are also loads of rogues within the city of Zuldazar. The casteless have to do something, after all. Monks don't make sense to me either, though.</div></div><hr />

Well, no, but weren't Orcs allowed to become magi because a Forsaken gave one a library card? Seems like the bar is pretty low to study the arcane especially considering they still have good, old fashioned &quot;human potential&quot;.</div></div><hr />

If Jaina can become a mage... why couldn't Kul Tirans equally become mages? Her existence literally proves they have the ability to be mages.</div></div><hr />

<br />
She didn't return home because of the situation with her father. <br />
<br />
She left to study magic in the EK because there was no magical institute available in KT so it made more sense for her to go to Dalaran. This was also to bring her closer to Arthas to basically arrange a political marriage between the Kul'Tirans and Lordaeron. <br />
<br />
Kul'Tiras literally has no mage academy. You could make a case for there possibly being other KT mages, but they might have died in the sacking of Dalaran by Arthas or all went with Jaina and lost their lives in Theramoore. <br />
<br />
The tide sages are being cast as shaman rather than mages. The idea being that they interact with the elements directly rather than through arcane manipulation. <br />
<br />
Pretty much all the choices they have for Kul'Tiran classes make sense in the specific confines of the lore. Doubly so for things like Druids which were written in specifically for BfA and don't forget that when we set up the portals in Boralus that the mages remark about how they are setting them up in a tide sage sanctuary with great magic potential that hasn't been used for years.</div></div><hr />

The only other option for me now is Hunter and mail transmogs are...not as good as Plate to put it simply.<br />
<br />
Think i will skip this race and wait for the next.And to rub salt in the wound, the fucking TROLLS get to be paladins.TROLLS!</div></div><hr />

If Jaina can become a mage... why couldn't Kul Tirans equally become mages? Her existence literally proves they have the ability to be mages<br />
<br />
I see your point, but if they could handle a growing mage in Kul'Tiras, then she wouldn't have had to go to school in Dal. Maybe that's what they're getting across.</div></div><hr />

They have the tidesage school but for the most part tidesages seem to be more of a cross between shadow priests and resto shaman with some extra flavor abilities thrown in to complete the theme. ( Like how most necromancer npcs throw shadowbolts and druids of the fang have lightning bolt.) <br />
<br />
I imagine the reason there are no kul tiran warlocks is because, much like they don't have an academy for arcane classes to learn there is also the fact that the &quot;witches&quot; on kul tiras are druidic in nature. Though I would have LOVED glyphs for demonology to get to turn their summoned demons into the wicker beasts and for affliction to get the blue death magic effects. :( <br />
<br />
And finally I imagine they don't have paladins because... Well, the silver hand was a creation of lordaeron and with the kul tirans worshipping the sea over the light it would have made any cultural spread there difficult. They do have their sea templar in shrine of the storms but those could also be seen as like... Plate wearing enhancement shaman with swords I guess? Speaking of.... With kul tirans getting shaman can shaman have swords? Please? Cutlasses are like the kul tiran's THING. I promise not to dual wield lightsabers spamming lightning bolt and finding peoples lack of faith disturbing... often.</div></div><hr />

Well no offense here but Mag'har orcs also got no Mage academy and they don't have any mage lore characters but For Kul Tiran, there's Dazar'alor raid boss on the horde side who are Kul Tiran fire mage named Manceroy Flamefist so I think it's weird that Kul Tiran don't get a mage as a playable class.<br />

Having one exceptional character is more believable than having an entire nation practicing something unusual. Paladins, traditionally, are associated with full plate knights who in addition to martial prowess, wield the light. You have to admit that this does not fit the imagery when thinking of tribal Zandalari trolls. While I think most people appreciate that they worship the light in one form or another; being associated with the identity reserved for paladins is a far stretch. I know most people will respond with the example of the Tauren, but once again, theirs is not the best example of the paladin class. Perhaps a twist on another class would have been more warranted. For instance; light modifiers to shaman abilities in the same fashion that druid shape shifting abilities are modified for the different races.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I honestly expected both Zandalari and Kul Tiran to not be able to be monks given that Kul Tirans are pretty isolationist and Zandalari have had really bad terms with Pandaria for a long, long time. Let alone that monks are built around agility over brute strength, which goes against the traditional Zandalari way.<br />
<br />
I do like the irony of Zandalari now opening up to the practice, though. It's interesting. Either way, them hating monks makes sense, but monks hating them... that doesn't really make sense at all. Pandaria has always been about being open minded and peace loving. They welcome the chance to uplift the Zandalari.<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
On a different note I honestly expected Kul Tirans to be able to be mages since their leader is now also a mage, but to be honest... it does fit.<br />
<br />
What I didn't expect were for them to be able to be priests. That, on the other hand, is a surprise. I can only assume that priests and shaman are both different types of tidesages, in a sense. They always did kind of seem like a mix between the two, after all.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
I'm hoping any extra ally Paladin goes to night elves. They've been foreshadowing those for awhile now.<br />
<br />
Well sort of. But I mean, the only thing that came of it was a single living night elf who decided to become one... and an undead who who randomly decided to become one (still don't get that one), let alone the fact that he was able to be sticking around to aid the Silver Hand as a ghost to begin with... if ghosts can join the Silver Hand, maybe they should have recruited Uther? I'm just sayin'.<br />
<br />
But I digress. It would be an interesting development for them, and I'd fully endorse it, but there is only a small amount of foreshadowing. There are plenty of unusual class combos that have been introduced over time, and I'd love to see more of them come to life. Night elven paladins are a part of that, as are draenei rogues. Gnome hunters were, too. :p I'm kind of surprised we don't have lightforged monks now that I think about it.</div></div><hr />

Actually she did leave to study..... Her family especially her dad was disappointed she decided to be a mage and left for the Kirin Tor..... and become and student of Archmage whats his face. Also if you want in game story characters to directly translate to player classes then tidesages are shamans. But as we all know characters dont fit neatly into player classes.<br />

If Jaina can become a mage... why couldn't Kul Tirans equally become mages? Her existence literally proves they have the ability to be mages.<br />
<br />
Jaina became a mage because she left Kul Tiras and went and learned mainland magic. A decision her family wasnt happy about. As far as tide sages they are sea priests as described in game and by blizzard and more akin to shamans for player classes or shamans mixed with a priest.<br />
But in game characters never match player classes anyway.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Welcome to MMO-champion. I'm sure you're totally a new poster and not an alternate account of someone who doesn't or can't post about this.<br />
<br />
I want to comment a few things here:<br />
<br />
1. &quot;Traditionally&quot; is the key word here, as paladins are defined by being warriors with holy magic that typically champion the weak or otherwise are virtuous or stoic in some way. You assuming that it can't apply to trolls is ridiculous, because &quot;they are too savage and don't wear enough armor&quot;, when neither is true at all of the Zandalari. You've been spending too much time with the jungle trolls I think, but it's forgivable.<br />
<br />
2. Worshiping &quot;the Light&quot; is not a requirement of paladins. It used to be considered one indirectly, until blood elves came along. And even then, it was never explored beyond that. What they need is a source of holy magical power. Every race that is a paladin right now has one. Be it from the Light, the Naaru, the Sun, the loa, Elune... oh wait, I am foreshadowing. Better not do that. :p The only paladin order I don't yet fully understand yet are the Dark Iron, but hey, that's a different story.<br />
<br />
3. In general, you seem to think that if paladins don't fit this obsessively arbitrary notion that paladins have to fit the &quot;knights in shining armor&quot; theme, they can't be paladins. Fortunately that is not true, as it would make this game very boring, indeed. My advice is to broaden your very limited amount of imagination in this fantastic fantasy game. Though, if you prefer, you could always just sit in classic... where paladin are and may always be exactly just that narrow stereotype you are claiming them to be. At least, until you run into a dark iron using paladin abilities or a Zandalari telling you a story about freethinkers</div></div><hr />

Kul Tirans represent a more spiritual rather than intelligent race. Which is why they can be Shamans and Druids and not Mages and Warlocks (Jaina is an exception). They are sort of like Pagan humans from back in the day.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Weriik</div><div class="date">2018-11-03, 01:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The only real outlier is Kul'Tiran mage in my opinion. While previous posts mention they have no magical academy or anything of the sort I remember quite a few pirates in BFA that were using fire magic and such, that one boss in Tol Dagor and the escaped convict WQ enemy in Tiragarde Sound off the top of my head. Monks make sense for them, specifically brewmasters. If Pandaren were to point out that drunken brawling is actually an incredibly strong martial art style I'm sure plenty of Kul Tirans would jump on the chance to learn more about it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Zandalari Paladins make sense, with the term paladin being rather loose. Yes they don't really match the idea of what your typical paladin in WoW is, but neither did Tauaren. A paladin is essentially a plate wearing or warrior priest that is dedicated to some form of higher power or religion and is granted power from it. <br />
<br />
As for Zandalari monks, the only thing preventing Zandalari from becoming them would be stubbornness or clinging to old hatreds. Remember that the Isle of Thunder fiasco was part of Zul's group, and I don't think the current Zandalari want anything more than to get away from everything related to him. Pandaren themselves wouldn't hold onto the old hatreds, and would be more than willing to teach if Zandalari would listen. Remember that the August Celestials are very similar to the Loa's themselves, and Zandalari at their core are a very natural and spiritual race - a category monks fall into. A Zandalari monk dedicating himself to the teachings of Xuen or Yu'lon isn't really that different from another dedicating themselves to one of the traditional Loa, both Loa and the Celestials are pretty much the same thing in different flavours with them being Wild Gods anyways. <br />
<br />
What I mean to say overall is that there are a lot of similarities, and religious/mindset classes fit perfectly with Zandalari if you keep the Loa focus/Loa are a source of power for them.</div></div><hr />

:thinking<br />
Actually, Jaina is a &quot;human&quot;. The 'Kul'Tiras' race does not denote &quot;came from Kul'Tiras&quot;, but actually a different race entirely. Also, I'm sure Kul'Tiras doesn't have mage schools, otherwise Jaina wouldn't have to go to Dalaran to learn magic.<br />
<br />
The closest thing Kul'Tiras have are the Tidesages, but they act more like priests/shamans than actual mages.</div></div><hr />

I was looking forward to making a Paladin to be honest. I am completely stupefied as to why Blizzard continues to have class/race limitations in the modern game. We continue to see NPCs break these rules, but we are still limited to them. Class/Race limitations are something that should have been phased out long ago. Gone are the days that we accept the &quot;lore&quot; limitations of it all.<br />
<br />
When a Night Elf Priest can become a paladin (and her dead ancestors can as well), we really need to see player options change. If there was going to be a race that couldn't be something it should have been Void Elves and Priests. Because a void elf using the light actually would have made sense. But what is stopping ANY race from dedicating themselves to the light?</div></div><hr />

Jaina was trained in Dalaran. Maybe next expansion, now that they've come to accept Jaina, arcane magic will become more accepted in Kul Tiras. As for paladins, they don't seem to care about the Light these days, they revere the sea.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Paladin class is new to even humans. Turalyon started the whole paladin thing in WC1. It isn't a fundamental human class by any stretch. Priests from Kul Tiras are tide sages, their religion revolves around the sea and not the light. <br />
<br />
Furthermore, there are Zandalari paladins as far back as vanilla.<br />
<br />
Kul Tiras doesn't even have an apostrophe in it, are you surprised you're confused about all this when you're not even sure of the name of the expac continent you've spent the last couple months in?</div></div><hr />

If Jaina can become a mage... why couldn't Kul Tirans equally become mages? Her existence literally proves they have the ability to be mages.<br />

Um yeah. I have been to Stormsong Valley. They are tidesages, they use WATER MAGIC. Their entire culture is about the sea and interacting with it.<br />
<br />
Of course EVERY race can &quot;become a mage&quot;, but ... and I can't believe I have to repeat this.. it is not a part of THEIR CULTURE. There are night elf paladins in the game (garrison follower for example), by your logic it must be &quot;stupid&quot; that Night Elves can't be paladins?<br />

<br />

<br />
Derp.<br />
<br />
Since you mentioned tidesage, I will just leave this here.<br />
Some might say Jaina is only Kul Tiran mage out there but there are other KT mages out there as well. There's a KT fire mage boss coming in the next raid.<br />
<br />
&quot;Manceroy Flamefist: Fire mage who uses the power of fire to attack his enemies&quot; (https://www.wowhead.com/guides/battle-of-dazaralor-raid-overview#flamefist-and-the-illuminated-details-abilities)<br />
<br />
Then what about tidesages? They are the religious organization in Kul Tiras where Kul Tiran people worshipped the sea and Tidemother instead of the light. Some might say they are a priest-shaman hybrid but I don't think so and here's why<br />
<br />
In my opinion the tidesages are just priest in name. They are just shaman wearing cloth gears and acting like a Priest organization. Why?<br />
<br />
- They worship the sea and the Tidemother not the light.<br />
<br />
- Do you ever see them use light-related spell like other priest?: No.<br />
<br />
- They have power to control the water and the wind, they can blessed their allies using water magic and which class actually do that?: Of course shaman.<br />
<br />
- Some of them can use the void magic they must be priest!: No those who wielding the void magic are get their void power from allied themselves with N'zoth and Queen Azshara.<br />
<br />
- They also use &quot;Anchor&quot; to binding others to the area around the Anchor, this could be their own version of shaman totem.<br />
<br />
- Since I don't see anyone mention this anywhere I will just bring it up here: The portal room in Boralus is describe as a place where the tidesage used to conduct their ritual and from that there's is a large amount of energy lingering there enough for making it to be a portal room(presume to be arcane). The portal trainer in the room is presume to be a tidesage (https://www.wowhead.com/npc=144310/yvia-wavebound). So I presume it safe to say that the tidesages are actually mage-shaman hybrid not priest-shaman hybrid.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now that you said tidesage is their culture, Kul Tiran can keep their shaman and swap priest out and bring mage in.</div></div><hr />

If you ask me, the reason priests are included has nothing to do with the Light, it's entirely the Void. There is no shortage of tentacle worship on Kul Tiras.<br />

Besides, I don't think swapping things out is really going to make people happy; it'll just shift these threads from talking about mages to talking about priests.</div></div><hr />

The tentacle things is from the Tidemother which they are worshipped(which I'm also forgot to mentioned).
