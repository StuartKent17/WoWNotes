Warlords of Draenor - Iron Docks<br />
Today we are taking a look at the Iron Docks, a dungeon located in Gorgrond.<br />

Warlords of Draenor - Dev Interviews<br />
GAME (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0Xk8VTtUyo) recently had the chance to interview Tom Chilton at Gamescom. <br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;object width=&quot;900&quot; height=&quot;70&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;movie&quot; value=&quot;//www.youtube.com/v/H0Xk8VTtUyo?version=3&amp;amp;hl=en_US&amp;amp;rel=0&quot;&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;allowFullScreen&quot; value=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;allowscriptaccess&quot; value=&quot;always&quot;&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;embed src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/v/H0Xk8VTtUyo?version=3&amp;amp;hl=en_US&amp;amp;rel=0&quot; type=&quot;application/x-shockwave-flash&quot; width=&quot;900&quot; height=&quot;70&quot; allowscriptaccess=&quot;always&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
Retaining the soul of the character with the new character models is very important, so players should feel that the new model looks like a higher quality version of the older one. Players have helped to address areas in which the models fell short of that goal during the design process.<br />
The more human like races have more player sensitivity to changes, as players are more in tune with how their character looked before. Other races, such as Tauren, are a little harder to spot changes on. <br />
Garrisons were originally called Frontier Forts when the team was brainstorming. Eventually the idea was refined to the Garrisons we see today, which finally answer the question of what players would actually do with player housing.<br />
For the most part, players have accepted the stat squish.<br />
The number of abilities classes have has gotten out of control, as most classes had enough abilities at WoW's launch, but more and more have been added since then. We finally reached the point where pruning had to be done.<br />
The design of the Arms Warrior lost its way over the years, moving away from what Arms felt like when WoW was launched. The changes in Warlords should solve this and bring back the identity of the spec.<br />
Tol Barad went the wrong direction after Wintergrasp, as it focused more on battleground like gameplay instead of the World PvP aspect. Wintergrasp did feel like an epic battle though. <br />

Classes<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ipaladins.gif Paladin (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/273-Paladin) / Skills (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/paladin) / WoD Talent Calculator (http://beta.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#I))<br />
Any chance for a on-screen visual for empowered divine storm? (Alike to what we have with exorcism etc.), would be lovely.<br />
Yep, Empowered Divine Storm is getting a spell alert. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/500075790873018369))<br />
<br />
Clemency is pretty mandatory for Paladins. Any plans to chance the other two talents, to be more an option for Paladin?<br />
Unbreakable Spirit is a great option if you're worried about survival, which seems to be a big Ret complaint. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/500433600102137857))<br />
<br />
Achievements<br />
If no &quot;real&quot; scenarios 100, why add achievement to do 1000 scenarios in WoD, seems like overkill to go spam 90 scens<br />
Agreed. Those were created long ago before we decided to focus on using scenarios as epic storytelling moments. Will fix. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/500091460083933187))<br />
<br />
Brawler's Guild<br />
Will we see new Brawler's Guild at launch or later in the expansion?<br />
Updated at launch, hopefully expanded later in the expansion. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/500072918924001281))<br />
<br />
PvE<br />
I'm really happy with the somewhat slower raid release schedule. I'm hoping the &quot;several weeks&quot; turns into, like, 8. Better for me! <br />
I like the number 8. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/500321330323922945))<br />
But seriously, probably in that ballpark. 4 weeks for MSV -&gt; Heart of Fear was too fast. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/500321613955334144))<br />
<br />
Will Challenge Mode bosses drop loot? Or will they be rewards at the end? (Figuring out database tech)<br />
Neither. Daily quest to do a specific CM dungeon of the day, like the daily CM quest that gives a bunch of Valor in Vale currently (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/500321885825953792))<br />
So GOLD isn't required to get the LFR level gear?<br />
Correct, it's literally just to complete a harder-than-Heroic dungeon. Speedrun is for cosmetic rewards. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/500322208216920064))<br />
<br />
Sort of confused on CM gear rewards now. Can you clarify the different ways to get different gear? Daily? Getting all Gold? Mix?<br />
Daily CM quest for a shot at LFR quality loot with stats. Then all Bronze/Silver/Gold for title/mount/transmog like in Mists. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/500328114015051777))<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
Why not make the crowd cheer in arenas when someone gets below 20 percent? And add some random yells from the audience. <br />
We would like to do some more atmospheric things like this...but you may notice, that right now, there are no crowds. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/500061696611090432))<br />
<br />
Please make skirmishes available for lvl 19s, a community that have been wanting them back for years and was so excited for WOD.<br />
Understand the requests. Looking into it. No guarantees until it's in the game for sure. May be issues at these late stages. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/500333174795157505))<br />
<br />
Alliance is being destroyed in Ashran right now.<br />
It's rough on beta as there's really no population control going on. But I've seen it swing both ways. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/500407009833799681))<br />
<br />
What happens to Spirit of Conquest enchants, etc. in WoD? Will still be able to be purchased? Maybe with honor like other items?<br />
We're going to incorporate them into the Garrison enchant transmog system. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/500749838980775937))<br />
with 2200 requirements still?<br />
Yes still a rating requirement. Not final on the exact rating yet. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/500751945800630273))<br />
<br />
Lore<br />
Am I the only one who noticed Kargoth's wrong hand being ripped off in the Lords of War?<br />
Shattered Hand generally replace their left hands. The original Warlords key art was mirrored. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/500063582516551682))<br />
<br />
So.. we haven't seen Naga yet in Draenor. Will we, or how did they get to Outlands?<br />
No naga in Warlords. They came to Outland with Illidan and Lady Vashj, and weren't here in this time. (DaveKosak (https://twitter.com/DaveKosak/status/500334258481676288))<br />
<br />
World<br />
I don't understand why don't they make every FP conneect to every other FP. All problems solved with a straight line,<br />
There's a custom path that the gryphon/whatever takes from each point to each other one. Has to be manually created. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/501092051799138304))<br />
I thought these were being rethought from the ground up? Seems like the same issues they've always had.<br />
Not sure what 'rethinking' you're referring to. Flight paths are still flight paths. Just need to be more efficient (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/501093547206914048))<br />
These problems have persisted for years. Wonder if FPs were put aside for a bit a better way could be found.<br />
It comes down to what you want flight paths to do, from a game design point of view. Point is not just fast travel. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/501096007946366977))<br />
<br />
Garrisons<br />
---recruitment felt like the big draw of the Inn to me.<br />
Epic dungeon quests with unique rewards a la WOTLK dungeon dailies, from awesome visitors like Gamon, Budd, Lunk, Oralius, etc. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/500326612995301376))<br />
<br />
can you add a garrison follower to spires of arrak inn or was one recently added?<br />
Several spires followers still to come. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/500423025267707904))<br />
<br />
Misc<br />
So, any chance Reshad is this expansion's &quot;Lorewalker Cho&quot;?<br />
Cho was definitely an inspiration. Reshad probably won't be quite as involved, though. (_DonAdams (https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/500750640554180609))<br />
That being said, I would love to see Reshad come back. He was fun to write and his voice actor is legendary. (_DonAdams (https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/500751036127010816))<br />

Computers - Setup of the Month<br />
Each month or every 2 months, depending on the hardware evolutions, we will post a couple of hardware setups for those of you who are thinking of upgrading their computer!<br />
<br />
This month<br />
The current SSD prices (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2014/august/ssdgraph.gif) are trending slightly downward over the past few months, with most SSDs under $0.50 per gigabyte when on sale. <br />
<br />
The Devil's Canyon CPUs (http://www.anandtech.com/show/8227/devils-canyon-review-intel-core-i7-4790k-and-i5-4690k) are here and they offer somewhat better overclocking performance and lower temperatures. Depending on how much you want to overclock, you may need to spend a bit more for a better CPU cooler like the NH-D14 (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002VKVZ1A?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mmochamp-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002VKVZ1A). <br />
<br />
Unless you are doing a lot of video rendering or streaming, you do not need the 4790K and should spend that money elsewhere.<br />
<br />
Make sure to keep your AMD (http://sites.amd.com/us/game/downloads/Pages/downloads.aspx) and Nvidia (http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us) drivers up to date.<br />

Ghostcrawler on WoW<br />
Ghostcrawler took the time to talk about WoW at the end of last week on the LoL forums (http://www.reignofgaming.net/redtracker/topic/116689-what-did-ghostcrawler-to-wow) and Twitter (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/with_replies).<br />
For a REALLY long time, you either had to play RMP, or pray you weren't queueing for 3v3 with the good RMPs were. RMP mirror matches were common on both the live game and in tourneys.<br />
Yeah, I agree this is another good example. At the time it felt like the choice was between PvP dominated by rogue-mage-priest or more diverse comps. The rogue-mage-priest ecosystem did have a lot of depth and a lot of what Riot calls counterplay. But if you mained a hunter or paladin, you felt shut out, and leveling viable alts was a much steeper proposition back then. We made the call to open up more Arena comps, but that did come with the added &quot;bonus&quot; of a lot of disruption and instability. Giving more CC and other PvP cooldowns to other classes did create some burst comps that lacked a lot of the depth and finesse of the RMP monoculture. (Trying to balance abilities for both PvP and PvE didn't help at all.) It took several expansions before this felt better once again.<br />
<br />
Was there a specific wow example that you think changed the balance too much? Whether you meant to shift the game that way or not, it seems like the playerbase thinks this has happened.<br />
There were a lot of specific class changes where players were convinced they were weaker than we thought they were, or others where players just had a different vision for the class than the developers did, which is always a tough path to navigate.<br />
<br />
If I had to point to one controversial change, I'd say that in vanilla and BC to a lesser extent, there were many specs that weren't really viable for PvE or PvP. We felt like they needed to be viable in order to justify being in the game, and we were reasonably successful in getting all of them much more competitive. I'll be honest that there were times when there was still one dominant PvP spec, one dominant PvE spec and one more-or-less dead spec per class, but we did get a lot closer than ever before, especially in the most recent expansion. (And that was the team that accomplished that -- I take very little credit.)<br />
<br />
So why was this direction controversial? One, it was just flat out harder to balance since there were more variables. It led to all sorts of religious debates such as whether pure classes &quot;deserved&quot; to do more damage than hybrids. In order to guarantee that a particular class or spec wasn't mandatory for raiding or Arenas, we had to share utility among more classes. (One example is shaman were no longer the only ones to bring Bloodlust.) This did homogenize classes, and some players were understandably not excited about that direction. I'm not sure of a better approach though. Maybe WoW should just have had 10 classes and not the 30 that different specs brought. Maybe some specs should have just stayed dead. I still think about this a lot.<br />
<br />
I was the lead systems designer on WoW. I managed about half the design department. My team was responsible for class design, combat, item design, encounters, and many of the features in the game like Dungeon Finder, Transmog and Achievements. As one of the leads on the team, I helped set the vision for the game as well. I was not the lead of WoW overall. I had much less to do with say world design, lore, quest design or anything business related. I didn't do very much implementation myself, because I didn't have the bandwidth to do it right, and because there were designers more qualified to do that. I was ultimately responsible for balance and that includes PvP, but I didn't make every change myself, and mostly I focused on removing barriers so other designers could do their jobs. I make that distinction because I don't mind being blamed for anything, but it does a disservice to a very large team to imagine one dude sitting on a throne spewing out edicts. Blizzard, like Riot, was very consensus based and focused on alignment.<br />
<br />
Did I and my team make mistakes? Sure. Every game designer does. I'm pretty honest about admitting them, though it's tacky to throw colleagues under the bus, so I tend to stay away from areas where I had limited influence. I'm pretty happy with the work we did overall, and very proud of the team we were able to build.<br />
<br />
Why am I spending all this effort to explain my role on another game? Because I don't want you or any other player to worry what my work on League means for the future of the game. While I think there are contributions I can make, I'm not interested in overhauling League by any stretch, and Riot would never let me get away with making dramatically bad choices that negatively affected our flagship, our only, product.<br />
<br />
So, if I may, here are some distinctions between truth and rumor, offered in the spirit of getting to know me better.<br />
<br />
1) I'm not super interested in compromising LoL design in the name of accessibility. Yes, League is obnoxiously hard to learn if you don't have a friend showing you the ropes. That sucks, but it's not worth stripping away the depth or potential for mastery for our core audience -- you guys -- in order to attract new players. That's not an approach every game can or should take, but it's the right call for League.<br />
<br />
2) I never played a Frost mage in WoW, or any caster really. I played healers and melee. Frost was hard to balance in WoW because of the kit of control plus burst, and I'm fine taking flak for that. But it wasn't because I wanted to dominate in PvP with my character. I would have been fired for that. It was hard in general to balance combat and rewards for a game with both PvE and PvP components. It's very nice to be on a game that is emphatically competitive, team-based PvP.<br />
<br />
5) I care enormously about player feedback and trust. That is why I spend so much time reading forums, Reddit and Twitter (@occupygstreet). In fact, that is one of the things I love about Riot and why I wanted to come work here. Anyone from my WoW days will tell you, I hope, that even if they disagreed with a design, they appreciated the effort I made to explain our reasoning and hear out their concerns. And this is the TLDR really. I have always been very vocal in my communication with players. I didn't intend to be the spokesperson for WoW, but my name was recognizable by a lot of players, and when they wanted to complain about something, they wanted to focus on a name. Again, I can take it. But that doesn't mean I called every shot on WoW and neither do I for League.<br />
<br />
6) I do like ponies, gin and long walks on the beach. That part is true.<br />
<br />
Do you ever regret opening the game up to be more casual? Instead of taking the kind of direction you are with league?<br />
Different approaches work for different products, and I don't want to second guess the WoW team. Let's just say that after working on Age of Empires and World of Warcraft for a total of 16 years, it's really refreshing to work on a game where I don't have to worry whether someone's grandmother can pick it up or not.<br />
<br />
Would like to see GC's grandmother (or mother or father or brother etc) kill Heroic 25m Siegecrafter Blackfuse!<br />
Blackfuse is not the standard by which most of the game is designed. It's memorable in fact because it's so much harder than 99% of what you do in the game. Very few players even try (though it is a great fight). You don't wipe 100 times leveling up. Few players quit running dungeons because they're too hard. In much of the game, death is unlikely and not much of an obstacle when it does happen. That's just the way the game was designed and the way nearly all players experience it. I'm not even commenting on whether I agree with that philosophy or not, but it was the philosophy.<br />
<br />
Regardless of whether anyone's grandmother can beat Blackfuse or attain Challenger tier is really besides the point. The points (and these are facts, because I was on the staff of both dev teams) are:<br />
<br />
1) WoW spends a lot of effort to make sure almost any player can pick up the game, learn the ropes, level to 90 and even raid if that's their interest. LoL spends almost no effort making sure almost any player can pick up the game. It does expend some effort to make sure that players who self-identify as gamers can pick up the game.<br />
<br />
2) As a result of these efforts and different definitions of potential audience, WoW has a much broader audience than LoL. That's fine. Different strategies work for different games.<br />
<br />
My point was that I spent a lot of development time on both Age of Empires and WoW trying to make the games approachable to a wide audience without compromising the game design. I don't have to do that anymore, which is s nice change of pace.<br />
<br />
It sounds kind of spiteful to say &quot;a grandma can pick it up.&quot; Just throwing that out there<br />
I meant no offense, but I chose that verbiage because &quot;casual&quot; is a very overloaded term. For some players it means that they play say League, but only once a month or so. For other people, casual means they play Candy Crush. For others it means, IDK, that you're unskilled at the games you play with no motivation to get better.<br />
<br />
I figured &quot;grandma&quot; would communicate the kind of non-traditional gamer that doesn't usually show up in your League matches. To be fair, they don't show up in WoW that much either, but we would use that term when discussing whether some UI or teaching element was obvious enough.<br />
<br />
WoW players seem to think I am dissing WoW. I'm not. I love WoW. But difficulty and accessibility are not the same thing. We spent a lot of effort on AoE and WoW making them accessible for almost any gamer. That was the direction of both games. League is targeted at core gamers and it's really nice to be able to spend all our effort on making the game engaging for them. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/502667921722978304))<br />
No, you aren't dissing WoW. Instead you are being contemptuous of a large portion of WoW subscribers.<br />
Contempt wasn't what I had in mind. They are just different games. I'm not advocating for WoW to abandon non-hardcore players. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/502678689239539713))<br />
of course that risks LoL putting off core gamers such as myself that dislike the environment Riot has established in LoL<br />
The best way to play almost any game, including League, is with friends. I really believe that. If your friends are toxic, well... (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/502671040477425665))<br />
and - I dunno. Coming from the console dev world, WoW fails pretty hard on the accessibility front, imo. (pedrothedagger (https://twitter.com/pedrothedagger/status/502669110681927680))<br />
Yes, but we spent a lot of effort on making it more accessible. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/502671586915516416))<br />
is LoL not something that should be able to be accessible?<br />
Not for a broad audience and not for casual gamers, no. Could it be easier to pick up? Of course. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/502668882797412353))<br />
It's very odd to hear that, because most people (including me) consider LoL very casual.<br />
Games can be played casually without being targeted at casual players. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/502670794804428800))<br />
<br />
Why do you hate my grandma Greg? <br />
It's challenging to be a hardcore gamer and have to constantly put yourself in the mindset of a very casual one. That said, I know some grandmas who raid. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/502664703894896641))<br />
Sounds bitter.<br />
Bitter? No. It's just nice not to have to worry about attracting casual gamers. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/502665182355922944))<br />
I'm open to recruiting any grandma's that can heal heroic thok. just saying.<br />
WoW has very hard content. That's not the same as being accessible to a broad audience. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/502667346012819456))<br />
<br />
I love WoW but if not for heroic raiding, I likely would have left a long time ago.<br />
I'm a heroic (mythic) raider. That's how I fell in love with WoW. But they can't sustain the game alone. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/502671835465789440))<br />

There's a widespread misunderstanding that most people even want to be &quot;brought up.&quot; Everyone has the tools and capability to do anything. How many do it? (Bashiok (https://twitter.com/Bashiok/status/502673030569807873))<br />
We thought in Cata that we could entice players to rise to the occasion to do harder content. But, you know, some players just said that's not why they play the game. More power to them. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/502677672179531776))<br />
<br />
I'd like to know what Blizzard considers to be the big barriers.<br />
Well *I* consider the biggest barrier being it's a 3D WASD game with a movable camera. (Bashiok (https://twitter.com/Bashiok/status/502677255915835392))<br />
I agree. So does a lot of data. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/502677926807371776))<br />
<br />
Man, I always supported you with WoW changes and felt really bad when you left, but that WoW comment... ouch. <br />
We updated Elwynn Forest twice while I was there to make the game accessible. It was a lot of work. There are very hardcore aspects of WoW but there are also casual ones. Catering to both (or all) is a big challenge. That's all I meant. I earned a reputation for &quot;dumbing the game down&quot; which is bizarre to me. I was countering that supposition. No offense intended.(Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/502706798936465408))<br />
<br />
I'm reading a lot of comments confusing accessibility with difficulty. Learning to play WoW is accessibility. Raiding is difficulty. WoW's intent when I was there (I can't speak for it now) was to appeal to a wide audience. Developing for a wide audience is very hard. Ulduar (my favorite raid) had two raid sizes (and optional hard modes). After that we added more difficulty tiers to broaden raiding appeal. <br />
Is that something you didn't want to do?<br />
You can argue it exposed more players to the fun of raiding, but might have diminished the psychological reward of doing so. Raids also self nerf over time as players gear up, and we did across the board nerfs as well. So dedicated players would eventually get to see the content. The change was more about whether players deserved to see new content when it was new vs several patches later. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/502722226622574592))<br />
Adding multiple tiers per raid is more work. Appealing to a broad audience is more work. For once in my career, I don't have to do that. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/502714933642268672))<br />
People struggled through bad design and confused it with mastery of difficulty.<br />
There also was very little concept of damage meters or optimal rotations in Molten Core. The audience matured. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/502715230770978816))<br />
<br />
What by your experience are the constant things that come up that make learning a game hard?<br />
1) Identifying the goal, 2) Understanding the controls, 3) Realizing where the fun is going to be. I mention that third point because too many tutorials strip away too much fun out of fear of burdening a new player.<br />
Hand held guidance vs joy of discovery and freedom. Can`t have both.<br />
Yes, but you can make the hand held guided part fun. Maybe you can see a dragon even if you have no business fighting one yet. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/502721490539008000))<br />
<br />
Explained another way, when you see a big drop off in players after only a few minutes then they are probably very confused. Players can't usually tell if a game will be fun that quickly, but if they have no idea what's going on, then they may quit. You see this a lot when casual players can't mouse look, a skill second nature to many core gamers. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/502725895598383104))<br />
<br />
Look, you can play a very demanding game casually or invest many hours in a simple iPhone game. WoW appeals / tries to appeal to many gamers who don't fit the traditional gamer mold. League doesn't go after those gamers. Simple as that. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/502727420781551618))<br />
I can mouse look, play WoW, and adventure games. Dont consider myself (hard)core gamer. Core/casual split seems so limiting<br />
It is very limiting. However, when even game developers watch a brand new player struggle with controls it's eye opening. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/502872123468025857))<br />
<br />
Can you talk one feature you like paper but did not went well in WoW? And one community complain announced b like when tested<br />
Reforging sounded great on paper but just became extra work solved by a website for most players. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/502721294560165888))</div></div><hr />

Well it was still a team effort and a number of the things some tie to GC are coming out of the mouths of the developers still at Blizzard or is seen from the games direction in certain areas. CG does talk about his job of making the game more accessible while saying it is no trivial task that did consume even more development time as well as more thinking outside of the box to appeal to such a wide player base. <br />
<br />
There was a number of things that was even done in Cata, but was met with bad design choices like removing max level normal mode dungeons which was a choice of trying to combat the queue issues for those that did them. It wasnt to make the game more hardcore, but the developers did think the playerbase as a whole could do it. The developers wasnt trying to exclude anyone. If they did then GCs pep talk would have been a short GTFO losers, but it wasnt.<br />
<br />
I certainly didnt see any 6 month delay excuse due to new staff on the MoP team with GC there. The team right now cannot even get their stories straight.</div></div><hr />

oh thats Cute. you do understand hes working on LoL right? game thats LITERALLY more Casual then WoW with nearly 99.999% of players being out of the Hardcore brackets and everyone watching the &quot;pro&quot; games on streams and the LCS (or region League of your choice)? like he's catering to a Far more casual fan base that is FAR more vocal to a company that listens to them. so maybe like know what your talking about before posting?</div></div><hr />

And also how hypersensitive gamers on forums are. And how political and poorly defined &quot;casual&quot; is. He's totally right, WoW has difficult content but also a long generous learning curve, LoL is a far less complex game (mechanically) but has no learning curve at all, you're just dropped into the game versus hardcore players the moment you log in and expected to somehow know how everyone plays the game.<br />

10/10 Joke/Bait<br />
<br />
League is a MOBA, by the very definition of the genre it is easy. It is basically WoWs PvP with less buttons to push and it even GUIDES YOU on what gear you should pick up. LoL is, in more than one sense of the word, easier than WoW on any level.</div></div><hr />

I'm dumbfounded by his remark as I have never heard players complain about retouching.<br />

While I can't stand LoL, my experience is many wow players like to play it and some of the hardcore wow players follow Lol top teams.<br />

<br />
I'm the last person to jump to his defense (I spent quite a while think he was an overbearing asshole), but I agree with him completely in this regard. <br />
<br />
I'm one of those people who never quite made the jump from 2D console games to 3D games. I can't tell you how many games I've quit in the first 15 minutes because I simply cannot seem to get the hang of the controls. Though, admittedly, that &quot;3D game with mouselook&quot; thing is harder for me than most people--I get motion sickness. <br />
<br />
My one and only experience with Halo was running into walls while alternatively staring at the ceiling or my feet. <br />
<br />
Ironically, in that regard I found WoW to be one if the easiest games to pick up and learn. But I do distinctly remember weaving around like a drunk with the camera bobbing around all over the place. It wasn't until I realized you don't have to use WASD to move and that you can move and steer with the mouse that I learned to play. You gain abilities at a slow enough pace that you aren't overwhelmed (unlike Magicka that lost me right after the tutorial). It holds your hand enough that you can learn what you're expected to do even if you haven't quite figured out how to move. <br />
<br />
Then, when you get to max level, it drops you off the deep end. Movement, positioning, optimal rotations, stay out of the bad, min-maxing. It's a different game and there's no tutorial. That's where it fails. Oh and contrary to their assertions, proving grounds (current ones at least) does nothing more than test your abilities. It doesn't teach squat.<br />
<br />
I doubt I'll ever be great at movement or positioning though. I am however a Wrath-baby, and I got spoiled. Thanks to the overgearing (from using 25 man gear in 10) and the zone debuff I managed 10/12 Heroic ICC. And stupid me, I thought that was the way the game was supposed to be. Then Cataclysm came out and I ended up spending 3 hours wiping in Heroics because har har &quot;Heroics should be hard.&quot; Like I said I'm not a GC fan.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Krommm</div><div class="date">2014-08-25, 02:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think my only disagreement with GC here this time is that LoL is one of the most casual games ever created. You can play games all day in League sure, but the same applies to WoW, Farmville, Hearthstone, ARPGs (D3/PoE/TL etc), Pacman, Tetris, etc.<br />
<br />
I would argue that it is easier to become great at WoW than it is to become excellent at LoL. WoW content starts off easy, then throws players into much tougher content. (arguably easy or moderately challenging for those of us who aren't bad or new to the genre.) <br />
<br />
LoL is a mixed bag even if you discount ranked games. There is a very brief tutorial, the controls are simple, but you will get completely wrecked until you learn item choices, team synergies, champion strengths/weaknesses, general champion gameplay, and mostly get some experience. You'll get matched against professional hardcore players and the most terrible of teammates/opponents.<br />
<br />
Both games are difficult when matched against equal or better opponents. Or in the case of WoW PvE, some of the heroic content can be challenging as well. Neither game does well on the accessibility and teaching front. Part of the issue stems from the majority of players not caring if their performance dictates victory or defeat.<br />
<br />
At any rate it sure seemed like Riot really wanted to attract casual gamers with 4 hero abilities, 2 picked universal spells, mouse clicking/camera movement and the recall button being the only keys available in playing the game. The fights are flashy and for many it is easy to watch. Disregarding WoW's PvP imbalances, the UI is really poor for PvP formats and is really awful to watch. (Imbalance + Skill Bloat + Poor easy to read UI = Very few tournaments)<br />

Anyways, I'd rather he just tell us what he did if he is going to prattle on. &quot;I made people's jobs easier, was in charge of balance and features, but also had no bearing on how good or bad things turned out.&quot;<br />

Note: I don't think LoL or WoW are hardcore at all. For the most part they are largely casual, which is why I can't take GC's comment seriously about not having &quot;to have to worry about attracting casual gamers.&quot; I also don't blame him for any imbalances, just his staunch defending of some poor decisions as he seemed to bear the &quot;messenger&quot; role well.</div></div><hr />

That's because you are connecting a casual gamer with a skill level, when it's being used in it's original and intended form, being, time.<br />

Casual = Time, Accessibility = Low(er) skill levels.</div></div><hr />

As an older player whose rl friends have mostly left the game for various reasons (mostly rl stuff) i find myself &quot;casual&quot; in that i don have a ton of time to spend in game anymore, my times are erratic, and I'm relying more and more on group finder tools. I get that people like a challenge, but I'm starting to realize the other perspective, the &quot;i don't have 3 hours to wipe on shattered halls for loot.<br />
<br />
I am skilled. On any class on the game, in all three roles. But my opinion is the polar opposite of yours. And that's okay, because that's all they are. Opinions.  <br />
<br />
Gc expressing his opinion is fine, but i do find it disappointing that he is so disdainful of some players who used to contribute to his paycheck.</div></div><hr />

GS doesn't even have to talk about WoW or hold these Q&amp;A's, he's doing this because he wants to. People have opinions and not everyone is gonna agree with everyone...that's life.

<br />
I don't know for you, but it's the community that taught be end-game in WOW. If I didn't join a friendly guild, I would have probably ended up thinking the game was over.<br />
<br />
And now with the guild invite spam stuff, you're most likely to join a guild who just cares about your money income than to teach you how to play.<br />

Right now, if you level in dungeons, people are so impatient towards new players it's unbearable.. you try to learn how to play and people kick you out and call you names.</div></div><hr />

Its kind of hilarious how little people know, i mean look at the numbers (facts) there's what , 32 MILLION active monthly players (and these are a little old, if anything there's more now) and now look at the ranked stats! Yeah! Rating and competition! Oh shit suddenly 90% of the ranked players are where? That's right.. IN THE BOTTOM! There are 5(6) tiers and the overwhelming majority is bronze/silver where people run around like they have downs, so where does your argument hold water? <br />
You cant say League is a easy game when nearly everyone who play the game ACTUALLY SUCK AT IT! lol , im sry if i come off rude but it's just hilarious: D Ghostcrawler used the word casual in a different way , as in how easy it is to get into the game not how much skill you need or don't need.<br />
I have done heroic raiding and it is a lot easier then League, whenever i play WoW for a while and go back to league it seems like i need to have abnormally fast reflexes, suddenly you have LESS than half a second to react to something or you're dead(which isnt even a big deal in WoW), but in WoW , you have so much more time to react to things. Even with this said keep in mind i have little to no experience in PvP , the balance is horrible and the game just was not designed with that in mind so obviously i don't have any input about how +2700 rating games are being played at , it's hard no doubt but this was a discussion about how hard it is to get into the game. PS: please don't talk about the number of buttons to press in WoW compared to League , thats not relevant when you can play high end PvE with the same amount of buttons lol..</div></div><hr />

What isn't there to understand? He wants to only cater to 1% of wows playerbase and is just short of saying fu to the rest of them.

Ghostcrawler is right about wow ... it is made for casuals, 90% of it in may optinion is made for casuals, the 10% is the heroic content that ... guess what, only a small percentage of players clear it.<br />
So yes wow is made that even a gandma can clear it (LFR ?) ... LoL and Dota are unforgiven, you will get stomped, you will be called a noob if you are one, if you rage and leave you will be punished ...</div></div><hr />

Quantity over Quality of players is just too bad.<br />
<br />
I'm not a hardcore player (never cleared the original Naxx, Didn't kill clear Sunwell)but I wouldn't be butthurt if I didn't see some content because I (or the group)wasn't good enough for it. That's how it is in life. It appears a lot of people feel they deserve 100% of the content even when they can't handle the hurdles to get there. Just go watch some youtube videos if you want it that bad.<br />
<br />
It's really too bad they got bought out by Activision... There was a sense of accomplishment before when you killed bosses, not only for loot but for pushing back the baddie of the expac (or die-a lot trying) now well you've seen the fight 3 times by the time you get to an actual 'difficult' encounter.<br />
<br />
I'm sad to say though that I've invested so much time in WoW that I will probably end up buying WoD.. I got too many commitments IRL to go and learn a new MMO. At least I managed to kick D3 in the ass</div></div><hr />

I got the feeling that he wasn't real thrilled with the idea of trying to balance both PvE and PvP with the same skill set. I also got a strange feeling that at a certain point they just went too far with trying to spread the utility and basically went to the point of no return where they just had to keep going with it. You can see in his talk about Frost Mages, that the spec just had too much stuff going for it, and frankly I think its not the only spec that falls into that category.<br />
<br />
As I said when it was first announced though, we will eventually figure out just why he ( and Pardo as well) left. I think its becoming very apparent that he was just tired of beating his head against the wall when it came to certain aspects of developing the game. I'm directing that more at his bosses and coworkers than I am the players.<br />

Frankly I blame Blizzard far more for the current design than anything asked for by players. The everyday player didn't ask that every ounce of meaningful content be routed through raids, Blizzard just chose that route because it was cheaper and easier to do.

Not everybody is good at Math, not everybody is good at art, not everybody can run at olympic levels, no matter how hard they try.<br />
And not everybody can do heroic raids. I was in a family guild with really nice but really bad people. We had people that died every time for example with Imperial Vizier Zor'loks spiral thingy.

And it was like that in every encounter. The bad thing was.. they really loved raiding.<br />
So don't tell me everybody can do anything. They couldn't, no matter how often we tried and no matter how easy we made it for them. And that was on normal.<br />
There are a lot of players that are not good at the raid dancing game. Oh dancing makes me remember Heigan. In all Naxx we didn't have a single run where everybody survived.

Do you agree though that they should be handed out epics and the gratification of having killed an expansion end boss OR rather that they should acknowledge their shortcomings, decide that either they'll only see content they can handle or move to another game without bitching at blizz about difficulty and not seeing content (which is what happened over time and made the game what it is today unfortunately)<br />
<br />
The kind of 'bad' you're describing makes me think they're here and contributing at pull then at some point they're just dead meatsacks enjoying the show in 1080p<br />

Holy shit. Did you just compare doing heroic raids to becoming an olympic athlete or the president? I get your point but come on... You don't need exceptional genes to raid in WoW, it's a videogame.<br />
<br />
You have to understand that no one was able to kill raid bosses straight from the get go. You also have to understand that raiding isn't (or wasn't... :S) only about killing the boss. Maybe I am a minority but I could wipe hundreds of times on a boss and still have fun as long as there was reasonable progress.<br />
I've also raided with people who were really, and I mean really, bad. But I have still seen them become better. I get that not everyone wants to put in that much time and effort to become better at some videogame but then this game just might not be for you...<br />

I don't see the problem anyway. You say they were bad at it, you wiped a lot but they still loved raiding. So, just let them do their thing then? And if you didn't enjoy playing with them you could have gone and played with other people.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Indirectly though, complaining about attunements , raid size etc you are asking for the company to make it easier for you.<br />
<br />
My guild was cooperating with another guild, back in the BC, to kill Maggy and Gruul. We weren't on the forums complaining.<br />
<br />
In my opinion, there must be a content designed just for the top in every MMO. If you want to experience it, become a top player, if not just sit back and enjoy the remaining content<br />
<br />
Oh we did the same thing, well actually we ended up getting Gruul down with 20 people on our own but that was later in the expansion. I have, nor do I think most people have a huge issue with there being that content they may not get a chance to see. However the problem is, that the game became so much about raiding, and gearing through raiding that people just didn't have much remaining content to enjoy. Its the one of the reasons that dailies get a bad wrap, they aren't bad, unless thats really all you have to do every day.<br />
<br />
This is the reason so many players asked for a 10 man format. They weren't asking to see or experience every single thing that the big guilds were doing, they just wanted something to do group wise as well. I sure as heck don't recall anyone in our guild complaining about the 10 man gear being lower level than the 25 man in Wrath, we were just happy to have something fun to do.<br />
<br />
As far as the attunements, those were removed as much because they were hindering new players from moving up even in hardcore guilds. Shoot for us, they were more annoying than hard, and it was actually the larger more progressed guilds that did the complaining about those, simply because it became such a pita to get new recruits.<br />
<br />
I think far to often though that Blizzard made design and philosophy changes based on the ideas of gaining new players and more profit and I think in some cases we as a player base allowed them to point the finger at us and blame us for decisions they wanted to make. Certainly players wanted every spec to be viable, and a huge portion of us wanted smaller group content made available, but I certainly don't recall anyone asking for instance for the initial Wrath heroics to be so easy, or Naxx to be as much as a walk in the park as it was ( we were actually disappointed with it as we cleared it in the first night. We were expecting something like Kara which took us a couple months to get down)</div></div><hr />

I remember the fountain was plain until the first guild got him down and that was quite a ways into the expac. I logged in one day and went to the fountain and there were statues around it and a plaque I could click and see Arthas taken down by Fordring. That satisfied my curiosity since my guild was stuck on Sindy and never got to the LK until cataclysm when we had more gear. I had gotten to see the lore.</div></div><hr />

We did too if you were referring to the Kara one, but the ones after that required you to down the content first ( TK and SSC) before you could move on. I could definitely remember a ton of complaints on the WoW forums from &quot; top guilds&quot; who were tired of needing to go back and clear those places just to be able to move people into current content as replacements. You saw many of the same complaints back in Vanilla as well in regards to that content.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shudder</div><div class="date">2014-08-25, 01:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That part annoys me. No not everyone has the capability to do anything. Yes that is something you tell your young child &quot;You can be president one day&quot; but in fact he won't.<br />
Not everybody is good at Math, not everybody is good at art, not everybody can run at olympic levels, no matter how hard they try.<br />
And not everybody can do heroic raids. I was in a family guild with really nice but really bad people. We had people that died every time for example with Imperial Vizier Zor'loks spiral thingy. We tried and tried and told them different tactics and said that they should do nothing at all on the second platform but try to survive the spiral running but they still died every single time.<br />
And it was like that in every encounter. The bad thing was.. they really loved raiding.<br />
So don't tell me everybody can do anything. They couldn't, no matter how often we tried and no matter how easy we made it for them. And that was on normal.<br />
There are a lot of players that are not good at the raid dancing game. Oh dancing makes me remember Heigan. In all Naxx we didn't have a single run where everybody survived. Usually it was me and 2 others that killed him in the end, everyone else was dead. Even after months they still died there.<br />
<br />
So they should make everyone president.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The kind of 'bad' you're describing makes me think they're here and contributing at pull then at some point they're just dead meatsacks enjoying the show in 1080p<br />
LFR is already like the special olympics these days and there are still wipes that happen there<br />
<br />
In the end that just happened. We managed to get by through Wrath and Cata normals but the MoP normals were to hard for our raidgroup and we disbanded the raid altogether.<br />
But still it was not a matter of them not trying or anything, we tried and tried and tried, they were just not able to manage the gameplay.<br />
<br />
So in a way yes, i think everybody should be president. Easymodes makes it possible for bad players to see the content. Bashioks comment goes in the direction that one hard mode and nothing else is enough since everybody could do it if they really want. And that is not the case in my experience. Some people just can't.</div></div><hr />

A good example: The changes made to the raiding model in Cataclysm, which GC often tried to justify.

Not only were we told that 10 = 25, but loot, achievements and lockouts were shared. That was just daft. You could not even fit all of WoW's classes into a 10 man raid, let alone include all player abilities, which limited boss raid design.

<br />
Fine, but that wasnt the attitude he expressed. He said it was challenging to have to generate the additional incremental guidance features that eased players into all of the games mechanics... Creating accessibility. He didnt say the mechanics of any of these games being mentioned were harder than the others, just that it was nice to have less in-game training to factor in. Its not hard to guess why... From the production side of things it slows the pace of dev with all the manpower that must be devoted to designing, coding, doing the graphics, etc. for all that obligatory learning content. If you can write that off for the players (of any skill level) to just figure out on their own over time, it removes a big resource drain. There might even be some changes that get sidelined because the overhead cost of accessibility is just too high.<br />
<br />
That really has nothing to do with hating anybody. Early on in wow, there was less accessibility investment and players just had to go to 3rd party stuff (elitistjerks, wowwiki, blogs, etc.) for most of the intermediate+ info. A lot more is baked in now, and more ingame assistance is getting added all the time. So he didnt enjoy managin all that overhead... So what?</div></div><hr />

IDK, watching 25 man raids get much better gear and that quicker was always disheartening. 10 != 25, but heroic should == heroic. Clearly Blizzard agrees with you though, so now we're stuck with 20 man Mythic. Thanks for that. :(<br />

Nobody I know has any interest in raiding heroic in WoD. It's Mythic or nothing. New video card not included.</div></div><hr />

League is a MOBA, by the very definition of the genre it is easy. It is basically WoWs PvP with less buttons to push and it even GUIDES YOU on what gear you should pick up. LoL is, in more than one sense of the word, easier than WoW on any level.<br />

Here's the thing.<br />
<br />
Resources are limited. Blizz will probably stick to x months of development of an expansion before moving on to the next.<br />
With that in mind. We're either going to get great varied content with a progression curve meaning some will never experience part of it or content that's 80% re-used (assets/art/textures/environments) with tweaks (some new spells and mostly new numbers) in 4-5 installments (1 for each difficulty level) and given the time taken to make those they'll give us some silly time sinks in between to do (dailies, farming, garrisons).<br />
<br />
So basically the game becomes 'repeat the same raids on various difficulty' or 1 long beautiful raid with various non raid content equally as engaging (think class epic quests of vanilla)<br />
<br />
People just need to recognize this is not the game for them when they've banged their head against it for long enough</div></div><hr />

I still think it's strange that in single player games no one is starting by default on easy ('cause why would i make it more difficult than nessesary) and then complain that is was no fun since it was so easy and refuse to play the other difficulties because they are the same content.<br />
No you start on normal or hard, depending on your taste and ignore the easymode.<br />
But in multiplayer games somehow it's unreasonable to ignore LFR because it would give a small gear-powerbonus to normal. It's somehow a &quot;we want it more difficult but we want the hard difficulty as easy as possible&quot;. I don't get it.<br />
<br />
And i don't think that balancing a dungeon to 4 or 5 difficulties is that much effort, in the end it's just adjustments in their database and a bit of testing.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">voskopoula</div><div class="date">2014-08-26, 06:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Some people here are throwing things like &quot;LoL is more casual then WoW&quot; ... now, I don't play LoL, I play Dota2, but the games are similar and both of them are harder to master by far then WoW ... in wow you can get away with anything ... in LoL or Dota you make a mistake it costs your team, make another and it costs your game.<br />
<br />
Ghostcrawler is right about wow ... it is made for casuals, 90% of it in may optinion is made for casuals, the 10% is the heroic content that ... guess what, only a small percentage of players clear it.<br />
So yes wow is made that even a gandma can clear it (LFR ?) ... LoL and Dota are unforgiven, you will get stomped, you will be called a noob if you are one, if you rage and leave you will be punished ...<br />
<br />
<br />
So let me get it straight, you consider skill to avoid making 1 small 10pixel move that will give the opponent the ability to take an advantage on an online game that a possible lag spike will ruin it anyway? And you consider a game more skillfull if you have to coordinate with 4 other players than a game that can go up to 24 other players in demands of coordination? You also consider a game more skillful if it's about players cursing other players and accusing them for small mistakes of 10 pixels because as you all think 10 pixels show the skill or not of a player?<br />
<br />
There are raid fights in WoW that are so sadistic that you gonna feel despair (blackfuse heroic 25 belt, Garrosh 1st intermission 25man, Garrosh 3rd phase without monk :P ) and so on. Lei shen hc. Yes WoW has a broad range of players but what the hell, LoL and Dota2 are also played from loads of kids that play them because they are free 2 play and i doubt the kids next door can beat me in LoL or any fps game or in wow skill. So let's put everything in perspective, GC is a whore and he is sucking his client (LoL) and his clientelle that thinks they are important and more hardcore (lol) because they play intense 30 minutes of not moving 10 pixels in a wrong way.<br />
If you think you can master a class in wow you are dreaming, being in the top 30% of WoW is way more deep and harder to achieve than being in the top 30% of LoL where you just need games over games along just 4 more other persons that can take and withstand your curses and shit. and you theirs :P.</div></div><hr />
