Healing and Mana Efficiency in Cataclysm<br />
If you use your efficient heal 100% of the time, then sometimes people will die for want of a quick or big heal. If you use your quick or big heal 100% of the time, then sometimes you will run out of mana. If you use the right heal for the job, you will be awesome and get fat purps. <br />
<br />
[...] We want the choice that downranking provided (don't use a big heal when a small one will do) without all the problems of gaming the coefficients of the lower level spells.<br />
<br />
[...] Prior to LK, healers wouldn't use their quick / big heal every GCD. They would even stop heals to avoid wasting mana. We're not really trying to bring back cancel macros in a big way, but we would like for the best healers to be the ones who know when to use the right spell at the right time.

Tanking Threat<br />
I would be very curious to see those numbers. You're making a jump from &quot;Sometimes AE pull off of me&quot; to &quot;AE will always pull off of me,&quot; and that's just not what we're seeing. I totally buy that a warrior may work harder to generate as much, or less, AE threat as a paladin. We've acknowledged that is a problem. But that is the comparison I would make, not the comparison between &quot;Sometimes I have to do stuff to maintain threat&quot; and &quot;Under no circumstances should I ever have threat problems.&quot;<br />
<br />
It isn't the goal that dps can never pull off of you under any situation. If that was the goal, we're wasting an awful lot of the game space on all of these +threat and -threat talents and abilities, when we could just institute a rule that mobs will never retarget off of their initial target (which would hopefully be the tank). I don't think that would make tanking more fun, though it would definitely make it easier.<br />
<br />
The threat-related goals still remain:<br />
<br />
1) All -- Get threat to scale better at higher dps levels.<br />
2) Paladin -- Nerf the threat capacity of HoR and SoC.<br />
3) Druid -- Something to do on AE packs besides Swipe.<br />
4) DK -- More burst threat, which the Icy Touch change should accomplish.<br />
5) Warrior -- As I've said, we're pretty happy with, minus points 1 and 2 above.<br />
6) I'll add that if taunts retain the ability to miss at all, it should be something you can gear your way out of. It's also possible we'll just make them always hit. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/23425588028-do-warriors-really-need-another-cleave.html))<br />

Having one of each tank at 80 and in t9 or better (Yay free T9 I won't lie :D) Honestly I feel this list is spot on. Warriors and DKs IMO remain the most fun/challenging (if you even can use that word. lol) of the 4 tanks Druids, being a one button spam fest on AoE Mobs make them very boring and Pallies are just the I really don't want to put any effort but still look good tanking class of the game. Personally I'm hoping they can make all tanks as interactive and fun as the Warrior is to play. That's just my opinion at least :)<br />

<br />
I am a Palatank myself and I'm getting pretty annoyed with Warriors complaining that Paladins can keep AoE TPS up more easily. In my experiences, the tank that gets initial aggro on a pack, will usually keep most of that aggro, independant of which classes tank. So indeed, Paladins have an easier AoE spell rotation, but it's not even close to being so that as soon as the Palatank starts AoE'ing, he pulls all aggro and the other tank(s) can just stand and watch. Paladins indeed do some higher TPS but I've never experienced that I pull all the mobs away from the Warrior and leave him behind with nothing.<br />
<br />
Another point I don't like in this discussion, is that Warriors seem to forget all the nice abilities they have that Paladins don't have. I'm talking about stuff like Charge, Intervene and Shield Bash, which I really miss on my Paladin. I have a Warrior tank as well and I'm in love with these spells. The way WoW is designed, is that some classes just are better at some things than other classes. Paladins are better at tanking trash, Warriors have more utility skills to save healers from getting hit.<br />
<br />
But the most important thing in this discussion: Why the hell are we discussing the ability to tank TRASH?<br />

I would but I highly Disagree with you. I've literally had mobs torn off me by Pally tanks in AoE Packs, Yeah i manage to keep like two But the Pally tears the rest off of me without even trying. Which is fine really but having an 80 Prot Pally as well, the class is to easy, Paladins don't take nearly the effort other tank classes take, and are so automatic, personally I find them a bore. Honestly everything they want to nerf needs to be nerfed. paladins need to be more than a &quot;barely pay attention and still tank like a pro&quot; class. as I said this is again my opinion (from experience.) Paladin is the Lazy man's Tank.</div></div><hr />

Actually considering it, since there are many good points raised. I do think the last thing Blizzard wants to do is take away Paladin tank's ability to tank in the first place, though. I really do hope so.<br />
<br />
People still do seem to miss that Paladins are &quot;easy&quot; because they don't have the options other tanks do. And if they were given them people would complain about Paladins being able to do X and Y at the same time.<br />
<br />
There's, like, no real way to win here. As far as NERFING goes, anyway.<br />
<br />
Buffing other classes? I'm pretty sure everyone would be down with that.</div></div><hr />

Because it's a part of the game, whether you like it or not. Druids, for example, have very little utility when trying to pick up multiple adds at once, especially when Challenging Roar is on cooldown. So they are trying to fix it. Sounds reasonable to me.</div></div><hr />

While you're at it, please also tell them to give bears a way to interrupt casters (preferably even 1-2 sec silence) with an ability with less than a minute CD. Tanking multiple casters is a pain in the (admittedly fat and hairy) butt as a bear, e.g. the ramp in PoS *shudders*, especially when compared to the shield-bashing/spell-reflecting/heroic throwing/shockwaving/concussion blowing machine that is the warrior... Just change Bash from being a stun with 1 min CD to an interrupt with 10 or 15 sec CD and I'm happy. :)</div></div><hr />

Some tanks pick of Seal of Cleavmand for it's splash damage. For tanks it turns Autoattack into a Swipe that does crap damage, but great threat. And only hit's four enemies. Aside, it's an easy way to get threat and hold it. if you're a tank, like Swipespam or Thunderclap.<br />

Honestly I think you guys should keep bash the way it is, and get a new ability that works like Shield bash. Also Think DKs should get a stun, that is not connected to the Ghoul, for tanking, nut I can also see why that would be really hard to implement without screwing PvP balance.</div></div><hr />

Yeah but hopefully you see why that's broken with HoR and Consecrate, plus the fact you don't even have tp press a button to essential do what a Warriors have to tab Cleave to do. Like I've said the biggest down fall to teh Pally that will result in you guys getting nerfed (probably repeatedly) is how automatic the class is and how they can do so much with little to no interaction.</div></div><hr />

I agree that the 96969 rotation is really basic and easy. The solution to this is not nerfing the Paladin's ability to AoE tank and then think the problem is solved. This way Paladins are still easy to tank with, but just less useful than they are now. The power of the Pala atm lies in it's ability to maintain AoE threat more easily, the power of the Warrior lies in their extra 'toolkit'.<br />
<br />
So basically, imo if they want to nerf the Paladin's relative ease of maintaining AoE TPS, Blizzard should give them some utility spells in return. I would love to have something like Shield Bash to be able to pull ranged mobs to me, because Avenger's Shield is needed during the initial pull (sort of like Shockwave) and stunning+silencing the target with Hammer of Justice doesn't quite pull ranged mobs either.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Most Paladin abilities are designed that way, unfortunately. And I don't thin Blizzard wants the 51 point talent in the Protection tree to be a X Strike Ability with no bells or whistles, like Crusader Strike is. Damage is one thing, but tanking utility is another.<br />
<br />
But that's something you'll never hear people admit. An ability works too well and they DON'T WANT TO HURT IT.<br />
<br />
Addendum:<br />
<br />
<br />
you don't have to be compensated for being nerfed. and no one said you were LOSING your ability to aoe tank. having such high aoe threat that you pull of any other tank you run with in a raid and let the other guy effectively take a nap while you hold the mobs however, is rediculous. it would be brought IN LINE with other tanks.<br />
<br />
you aren't three either. you don't needa be given a new sippie cup to focus on after mommy takes your binkie away. <br />
<br />
So, there you go. The wisdom of WoW's forums.<br />

Tanking multiple casters is a pain in the (admittedly fat and hairy) butt as a bear, e.g. the ramp in PoS *shudders*, especially when compared to the shield-bashing/spell-reflecting/heroic throwing/shockwaving/concussion blowing machine that is the warrior... Just change Bash from being a stun with 1 min CD to an interrupt with 10 or 15 sec CD and I'm happy. :)<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh please this. This is the one thing I hate about tanking on my Druid. Even on &quot;easy&quot; H-OK and those damned Spellflingers. I interrupt the first one of those empowered Shadow Bolts that do 75% of base health as damage, and just pray that one of the DPS has the brains to focus on them for the next minute until my interrupt is up. Even better, since Bash is a stun, not a silence, they just stand in the middle of room aggroing pats. <br />
<br />
Those are least trivial to take down though, and can often be LOSed. The casters in H-PoS and H-HoR are the real problems. My kingdom for an interrupt on a reasonable cooldown.</div></div><hr />

I've literally had mobs torn off me by Pally tanks in AoE Packs, Yeah i manage to keep like two But the Pally tears the rest off of me without even trying. Which is fine really but having an 80 Prot Pally as well, the class is to easy, Paladins don't take nearly the effort other tank classes take, and are so automatic, personally I find them a bore. Honestly everything they want to nerf needs to be nerfed. paladins need to be more than a &quot;barely pay attention and still tank like a pro&quot; class. as I said this is again my opinion (from experience.) Paladin is the Lazy man's Tank.<br />

I doubt this was intended. Without this mechanic a Paladin does need to tab target packs.<br />
<br />
I do find it slightly hilarious that the core complaint is that Paladin's actually work. We are a tank class that actually has a core rotation, like a dps class. We don't have to wrestle with our class to get it to work. But, I think a lot of non-paladins think our tanking ability beings and ends with the 6969 and it doesn't. The skill comes into play in utilizing our small but potential tookit. Finding the right time to use a hand spell or divine sacrifice is a must.<br />
<br />
But, I do like the fact that paladins work. That I can spare time to look at the raid, worry about positioning, shout commands over vent, etc. I think warriors would benefit a lot by having their core mechanics revamped a bit, to me they feel broken. I am envious of a warriors incredibly deep toolbox however...and critical block.<br />
<br />
<br />
I feel the exact opposite, I hate that Pallies have a stuck rotation it feels too easy to me like I don't have to try (I have an 80 Prot pally). Being able to do everything you posted in your last paragraph plus always having something that has to be done, makes tanking feel more rewarding and satisfying to me. Paladin's don't fill me with that same reward. I feel like, I chose to put the game on easy (the game is not hard but you know what I mean.) rather than try to actually force myself to be more competent. If they changed the Warrior to be more like the pally I for one would quit tanking. If I wanted easy threat, automatic debuffs and an automatic class i would play my Paladin and not complain about how mind numbingly easy a prot pally is compared to every other tank.<br />
<br />
Now I'm not saying Pallies are not good at tanking, I'm saying they are too automatic and too easy, and generate to much threat that it becomes a Oh wow my fav show is on, let me watch that while I raid, barely pay attention and still look like a pro. (If other people can't do this playing a Prot Pally, I may have just spent to many years playing on two screens multi-tasking.) Where as with a Warrior, DK,and Druid I have to actually pay attention to teh game fully.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mordras</div><div class="date">2010-03-08, 07:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Some tanks pick of Seal of Cleavmand for it's splash damage. For tanks it turns Autoattack into a Swipe that does crap damage, but great threat. And only hit's four enemies. Aside, it's an easy way to get threat and hold it. if you're a tank, like Swipespam or Thunderclap.<br />
<br />
There are actually two components to this seal. It does X holy damage to your target and will &quot;cleave&quot; that Holy damage to 2 other targets. Auto Attack and Shield of Righteousness both will do the cleave portion. Hammer of the Righteous does not do the cleave however it does apply the Holy damage to each of the targets that the hammer hits. Also adding Reckoning to your build will increase your auto attack by a large amount and thus increasing the effectiveness of this seal quite a bit.<br />
<br />
It may seem like &quot;crap damage&quot; on the surface but it quickly adds up. When I first read about this dramatically increasing DPS for a tank I was skeptical until I tried it. On trash my DPS went from around on average 2200 DPS to 3200 DPS. <br />
<br />
While this is nice it really is out of control. When 3 of the 5 main abilities in the tanking rotation are doing AoE damage and two of those are on a 6 second cooldown something is wrong. Personally I think Blizzard should just make Seal of Command only usable when wielding a 2HD weapon. They might even need to tone down the damage HotR is doing as well because even before I used SoC I felt maintaining threat on trash was trivial.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I agree that they should probably just remove SoC from our toolkit, since it just makes AoE tanking entirely too simple. I'm nervous about them nerfing HotR, however, since unless they did it in a rather elegant fashion that only affected the AoE portion of the ability, that could really hurt our single-target threat (given that in 2xT10 and in fairly good gear, HotR hits harder than anything else we have by a substantial amount), and I'm not convinced that's actually necessary. It could just be my experience, but I haven't noticed that paladins have any great lead on the other tanks in terms of sustained single-target TPS.</div></div><hr />

<br />
dunno about now, but certainly when I was tanking ulduar trash on my druid pre-TOC, keeping AoE agro was pretty hard. swipe was doing on average 3-4k TPS if lucky, whereas AoE was doing 10-12k TPS. I'm sure it's even worse now.<br />
<br />
Oh, and it's just incredibly boring.<br />
<br />
bottom line, take away HoR hitting like a friggin truck and doing stupidly high thread on 4 targets at once, and buff up consecrate - give it a SNAP agro with a DoT component like it has now. perhaps something like the way wild growth works...?</div></div><hr />

Off course it adds quickly. That's how tanking works.<br />

Also, No tank takes Reckoning. None that I know of, anyway, thanks to be far too over capped in various mit stats for Reckoning to proc ever.</div></div><hr />

Reckoning was great for paladins tanking Anub with all their stacked block rating but in general I find prot pally talents are stretched too thin to have room for something like Reckoning.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To each their own really, that's why the tanks most likely have different Playstyes, but fact still remains, Playing a Prot Paladin is putting the game to easy in terms of tanking. Some people prefer to play their games on easy, some prefer to play their games on &quot;Hard.&quot; Personally I have no problems watching the the fight with an FCFS rotation, I don't spend the entire fight watching my hotbars. Warriors have to know when to use key abilities far more than paladins do. Personally, I like having something to do every single GCD and not be a set rotation, it personally puts me into the fight encounter more. Paladins take me out of the encounter because I don't have to put as much concentration into the game. I also have fantastic Raid communication, perhaps I'm just better at multi-tasking so I find the Warriors play-style fun and more appealing. But at the end of the day you and every Prot Pally should know that Warrior that just MTed did far more work than you did, and did it just as well, without having to put it on easy mode. That to me is the most insulting part of the prot Pally and why i refuse to play mine anymore.</div></div><hr />

This can work both ways though. Sometimes being in that 'zen' left me free to focus on other things in the fight, other times it put me to sleep and I missed cooldowns.</div></div><hr />

Warrior tanks, you're doing it wrong.<br />
<br />
Don't tell me how hard it is. Your opinion doesn't matter. I tank with a Warrior tank, and his Shockwaves regularly crit for 10k. His Thunderclaps hit as hard as my Consecrations do throughout their entire tick. His Shield Slams crit for 12k with Shield Block up, and his Revenge already hits as much as my Hammer or Shield.<br />

And you have no idea what you're talking about! Congrats!<br />
<br />
No tanks have hard rotations. None of them. It's about leading the raid, watching your CDs, and using your tank utility.<br />
<br />
During any given fight, I'm putting Hands on people for any number of things from removing stacks to removing snares, popping Divine Sacrifice/Guardian (which has saved my raid multiple times), keeping Sacred Shield up to let Holy Paladins use it on other people, and even watching my other tank in case he needs extra mitigation/a quick heal.<br />
<br />
So no, Paladin tanks aren't easy mode. You're just a bad one, but think you're a good Warrior tank because you're clicking Heroic Strike a lot. Bye.</div></div><hr />

I like play my pally tank not because he is easy,I still have dumb ass dps pull aggro before me and I have to work my ass to get aggro back,i like the mana aspect because Rage seems limiting to me,I like the idea of of a holy warrior going into battles to crusade for his righteous ideals.warriors are just so dry when it comes to their abilities and game play.Fury is fun but tanking for me is just tedious and doesn't feel as epic as warriors.<br />

<br />
So the fact that you have time, while tanking, to do part of the healer's job doesn't say to you that maybe the tanking itself is relatively easy? I'm not saying it isn't great that you do all the extra stuff, but the fact that you have time too seems to indicate that the actual &quot;get and keep threat&quot; part of your job isn't taxing you much. Maybe the reason that your Warrior is keeping up with you so well it that he's putting out pure TPS abilities while you're busy casting heals, Sacred Shielding, HoFing, blah blah blah. <br />
<br />
Again, Not saying you're doing it wrong, it's nice that you can do all this extra stuff for your raid. Most tanks, however, don't have that kind of utility. So they spend all their GCDs on Threat generating abilities. And you keep up with them. Think about it.</div></div><hr />

Most Hilarious post today. You sir have no idea what YOU are talking about when it comes to Warriors.. I was waiting for that one Self Righteous Paladin tank that really believes his class is hard. I was in shock you didn't rear you head in sooner. I dunno have you ever thought the fact that you can do all this stuff that say your healers are doing may not be intended.. and this proves that your class is so easy that in order to fill gaps you do jobs not intended for your spec. YOU sir just proved my point more so that Prot Paladins are easy mode. <br />
<br />
I mean I'm sorry my Demo Shout isn't automatuc and I have to reapply it myself, I'm sorry that my Shield Block ability is on a longer cd and not just one of my random rotation Buttons (and guess what Prot Paladins have a rotation, you're the one who has no idea what they are talking about, Guess what so do DKs to an extent.) I'm sorry I have to judge when to use my Last Stand because mine doesn't automatically save me from death. I'm sorry my Cleave isn't on my auto-attack. I'm sorry I have to use a lot more judgment, when to use certain tools, I'm sorry I have to actually watch interuptable attacks, I'm sorry I have to watch for Buffs on the Mob that need to be removed (Mind you those last two things usually you can have someone else in the raid do and just worry about TPS and positioning, but smetimes you are SoL and end up doing one or the other.). I'm sorry my class takes far more attention to do my classes spec correctly and you get to Lolligag and do things your spec is not supposed to be doing. I'm also sorry that you've brainwashed yourself into thinking your spec of class is hard. Bye.</div></div><hr />

I'll start by saying I don't think Paladins are difficult to tank with. But to get to your points:<br />
[1] A retri paladin will do this, and yours is AoE. Try putting a -AP debuff on 10 mobs as a paladin.<br />
[2] Your shield block works differently. Yours can be used to absorb bursts. Paladin's still have their version from back when crushing blows were a big deal.<br />
[3] You don't see this as a bonus? I do.<br />
[4] Back in TBC I used to create macro's for my warrior. I just macro'd 1 active ability with an on-next-swing attack. That doesn't work no more?<br />
[5] You have certain tools. Paladins would love to have them.<br />
[6] No raid relies on a tank to do the interrupting. But Paladins would love to be able to do this.<br />
[7] Same as #6. You're just showing how superior warriors are. You can tank ánd do this kind of stuff.<br />
[8] Really? You're assuming Paladins just use their 969 rotation and that's it, while Warriors are supposed to do a million different things. Paladins can say the same thing. Paladins need to watch people to get cleansed, remove slows, reduce their threat, give them a shield, change aura's, LoH someone etc.<br />
<br />
Paladins aren't hard to play. Warriors aren't hard to play either.</div></div><hr />

I think this is the problem Sageth: Those are not the jobs of any tank. Your jobs are:<br />
- keep yourself alive (through the use of your emergency cooldowns)<br />
- keep the raid alive (by, and only by, generating threat on the targets assigned to you)<br />
No tanks are meant to remove anything via cleanse or hand of freedom, reduce threat via hand of salvation, or heal somebody via lay on hands.<br />
<br />
Utility is meant to be left to the dps and healers, your sole job is to tank.<br />
<br />
The only exception to this that I'm aware of is self-cleansing when tanking steelbreaker but, again, this is using your own abilities to keep yourself alive. If you have time between keeping threat and paying attention to the other enemy targets to dispell or heal either you outgear the encounter or something is very, very wrong.<br />
<br />
... or perhaps we're all looking at this the wrong way. Maybe that's the paladin tank's utility: keeping threat is made easier than for other tanking classes (the existence of the 9696 macro cannot be denied) in order for them to provide more raid help while keeping aggro.

<br />
I disagree with your statement. I am a pally healer - and here is what I notice with several fights in ICC healing tanks of all classes.<br />

Paladins: The funnest to heal - but perhaps only because we generally do better with undead. In fights like Rotface - a paladin tank must be ready to cleanse and pick up the Big Ooze - to put that duty onto someone else like the pally healer would be silly -- they cannot judge if the OT is ready for the slime to be dispelled. Also, using Hand of Freedom during this fight allows the Pally tank to walk through the slime without the movement debuff -- which is very nice. Throwing out hands to others is a way for a pally tank to be responsible for his control over raid threat (especially using Hand of Salvation). It would be silly not to use all of your utility spells if you are a skilled enough player to do so. <br />
<br />
Warriors: By far have the worst track record in staying alive. I can sit there and crit you for 25-27k per second and you'll still die. Why? I don't know, I'm a healer, not a tank. <br />
<br />
Druids: The easiest to heal by far. There is just something about barkskin and the 40 billion other cooldowns that make me, a tank healer, all tingly inside. I've never had issues with a druid tank holding aggro or dying via random damage spikes. <br />
<br />
DK's: A very unique choice - I've seen some horrible DK tanks, and some beyond excellent ones. It's all about skill imo. <br />
<br />
Either way - tanking isn't difficult - that's why there aren't many tanks -- it gets too boring. There are some terrible tanks out there that don't know how to hold aggro - however, if you are popping your cooldowns intelligently and using the fight dynamics correctly - you should have no issues no matter what class you are. <br />
<br />
Arguably certain classes have an upper hand in tanking - but overall you all do the same thing. <br />
<br />
Quit your bitchin and do your job. ^_^</div></div><hr />

DLC is great as usual<br />
<br />
<br />
We get it. Every god damn time a DLC comic is released, the comment page is filled with, &quot;DLC is win again, DLC is great as usual, DLC is awesome as usual.&quot;<br />
<br />
WE GET IT! ARGH! Seriously, why not only comment when it is bad, and comment on how they could have made it better by your standards or something. Or just not talk about it at all and comment on the damn WoW changes.<br />
<br />
OT: I don't care if it is unstable atm, RELEASE! I want to go into RS already!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Claiming a warrior tank is harder because he has to interrupt is the same as saying a paladin tank is harder because he has to cleanse. Both are usually done by others. Both make the tanks a bit more unique.</div></div><hr />
