Cross Faction / Faction Change ETA<br />
We have not announced a date on which this feature will go live. Please keep an eye out for announcements about this on our homepage and amongst the stickies atop this forum that will appear as and when have more to share.

+Hit and dispelling bosses<br />
There is one legit case where it can be useful for a healer to have hit, and that is trying to dispel against a boss. I mention this because we don't like the idea at all and have plans to change it. It's not fun when you try to dispel say Fusion Punch, miss, and wipe.<br />
<br />
In the meantime, be aware that dispels can miss in PvE against targets higher level than you (which is inconveniently, bosses). (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/19109952722-is-hit-for-dps-only.html))<br />

Mage DPS in PvE<br />
Mages aren't going to be top dps on every encounter, but they're usually up there. We're not at all worried about a Sunwell situations where mages were routinely replaced with warlocks (which let's not forget was partially because warlocks buffed Shadow damage instead of damage). I think this particular card is being overplayed. <br />
<br />
[...] We would like to get Arcane back up there. The Living Bomb change is just going to be another reason not to play Arcane -- we get that.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure it's possible to get Arcane to within 5% or 1% of Fire, but if we get it close enough then players who just really love Arcane will still be able to play it without feeling they are making a bad mistake. Frost is even more challenging to get up there, but we aren't giving up on the idea.<br />
<br />
It is a nice goal in rainbow unicorn land to may Frost, Fire and Arcane do identical dps in all situations, but we try and be realistic about our chances for that. Especially among pure classes (but even between say warrior trees) one spec will likely win. That's cool. It doesn't mean the &quot;loser&quot; has to be way, way behind.

Using Hand of Reckoning on Taunt immune bosses<br />
We call it &quot;paladin slapping&quot; and it's particularly funny when a group of paladins get together and slap around a boss in rotation. But no, it is not intended.<br />

Power Word: Barrier (Group PW: Shield)<br />
We still like the idea of PW:Barrier. It wasn't that the spell was inherently unbalanceable. We just thought we would have to devote a lot of effort to making it work, and given that we were in the middle of a patch with lots of changes, we thought we should focus on more critical matters.

Totem-stomping: Mouseover macros<br />
At this time, we don't have a problem with mouseover macros. They require some player attention to look out for totems and target them. That's a lot more investment than the macros that just have pets kill totems whenever they appear.<br />
<br />
We're not trying to prevent killing totems from being a viable strategy. We just don't want it to be too automated either.<br />
<br />
We will revisit this philosophy depending upon what kinds of macros crafty players come up with. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/17223043118-design-intent-on-totemstomping-macros.html))<br />

A way to balance would be to stray from that and go pure pvp in 1 tree and make it painfully obvious, trying to get classes to do massive dps in pve will have a trickle down effect for pvp. The exception of course is healers need a dps and healing spec (imho) for pvp so they have to make talents in the healing side that only affects pvp, or pve. Classes with 3 different trees Druid/Paladin would have to have the most work done on them because you can't just chop talents out though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Arcane seems to suffer not because of poor design, but due to difficulty with attractive loot. The t8.5 set bonus is quite lackluster if you aren't fire, for example.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I haven't raided as a mage since TBC, so I'm just wondering, is what I hear really true? Do mages really do such subpar damage compared to other pure DPS classes, or is this actually, like the Blizzard dude said, people overplaying their hand - particularly in light of the LB changes. Cos you know, as soon as the patch was applied, I saw a lot of posts saying &quot;this is exactly what we need, mages are in a good place atm&quot;, since the hotfix, all I see are &quot;Mages are Blizzard's joke to WoW&quot; and &quot;just roll a warlock, they're like mages but good&quot;. What's the actual lowdown here?<br />
<br />
Clearly Paladin slapping is an unintended bonus, and it's right they should fix that.<br />
<br />
Power Word: Barrier - I really like this concept, and am very interested to see how they expect to go about implementing it. An actual PW:S on all the people in a group within range of your target, same absorption, Weakened Soul and all, or actually a slightly different effect? Cooldown / mana cost?! Very exciting.<br />
<br />
Mouseover is a world away from /tar grounding totem /cast whatever. Really no comparison.<br />

<br />
<br />
What does that have to do with mages wanting to be competitive with other pures? Right now mages are the lowest of the pure dps classes and getting beat by some hybrids, the LB change that happened in 3.2(and then was nerfed 12 hours later) actually made us competitive with hunters/locks/rogues but now we are back to doing the same dps as 3.1<br />
Thats all we want but it probably won't happen any time soon.</div></div><hr />

Well, we wanted similar single target DPS, but the hotfix put us exactly where we were pre-3.2. Living Bomb is highly situational. Its great for things like Mimiron P4, but doesn't do us any good in fights like XT. <br />
<br />

What's the actual lowdown here?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Well, cutting a long story short, mages are currently lower than any other pure and behind some hybrids (DK and droods), with the exception of some &quot;gimnicky&quot; fights, with specific buffs to casters. Also, the only competitive PVE setup is a TTW fire one (think a 20+51 Ar/Fi setup or similar). At WoTLK launch it was not the situation: arcane and FFB setups were more than competitive, and mages were at the top. But - obviously - things have changed considerably since then (not for frost PVE - it has been dead since inception).<br />
<br />
Coupled with this, (raiding) mages still are considered as having the lowest survivability of all DPS classes, and certainly have the lowest sustainability (a mage without mana is.. aah). <br />
<br />
Taking into consideration the casual orientation and the somewhat successful &quot;bring the player not the class&quot; mantra of Blizzard all this could be seen as a lesser issue. But mages are a bit sensitive to all this, because they have had deep problems with Blizzard since TBC launch. With reason, one may add, because the lack of knowledge of the actual game (and even the theorycrafting) shown by the then lead designer was just appalling. All these issues resulted a rather publicized series of interviews with the top guilds leaders clearly stating that mages were the most useless class in WoW (in TBC). In a way, even Blizzard aknowledged their mistake (hence the &quot;sunwelled&quot; reference), but GC has shown an uncharacteristic ... ignorance.. in his post.<br />
<br />
Now, what is the gibe with locks? <br />
<br />
For starters, it is not restricted to locks, the comparison extends to all pures (and not only). But locks are indeed referred the most - the easy explanation is that they are the most similar class - ranged DPS caster. Another reason is that locks were an OP class in TBC - destro locks were a broken class/spec throughout TBC, specially in the later stages. So yes, mages were being replaced specifically by destro locks.<br />
<br />
Now, my personal opinion is that Blizzard has failed to design locks as originally intended. It also seems that locks have a &quot;population&quot; problem compared to mages at the same power levels - I'd put it to more people enjoying mages playstyle than locks (which I personally find a bit boring, but ofc it depends on taste) - which seems that leds to devs to compensate in order to achieve pop balance. Yes, it is something they state they don't do, but lies, buffs and nerfs are the tricks of the trade :).</div></div><hr />
