SKY IS FALLING. NO WAIT I DIDN'T SEE ALL THE CHANGES. <br />
<br />
Thunderstomp is now a pet talent available to any Tenacity pet. Now your bears, crocs or ESPECIALLY CRABS can join in the AE tanking fun. <br />
<br />
Assume the gorilla pet will be about as useful in PvP as the pets with stuns, of which there are several. Most of those have cooldowns in the 60 sec range. Pummel could probably be less than that.<br />

Nothin' says style like a candy apple red mechanostrider with a bitchin' flame job.<br />
<br />
As for the arena I'm still not sure where they're going with it. It needs to be constructed so I find it unlikely that it'll be a once a year event. Possibly something similar to Darkmoon Fair (noticed that under world event achievements) where it's open once a month. Wait and see I guess, skimming through the blue posts about it make me think it'll be similar to the Darkmoon Fair.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They're officially not trying to make weapons look like anything good anymore. They're done. No effort. Not even an attempt now. They just draw some crap and make it a weapon. &quot;Hey look! I drew a figure 8! Lets make it a sword! All the fanbois will fawn over it like its the best thing ever!&quot; Their ideas are corrupt. The end.<br />
<br />
This unimaginative bullshit has to end. This is the biggest game in the world. Why the HELL can't the afford to pay some people who have a CLUE at designing believable weapons??<br />
<br />
<br />
As a game artist i can tell you they do put alot of effort in to the GFX of the weapons. That is besides the fact that some weapons dont look that good for the kind of game this is, on this point i agree with you. Maybe they have some Starcraft designers in the WOW team, and they have been working on SC2 for so long they can only see SciFi.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, people also complained about the Deadly Gladiator looking to plain. While i personally think the Arena PVP gear looks really good (at least for hunters).<br />
Eitherway, Blizzard tries to satisfy 2 kinds of ppl here. Ppl who want to look EPIC! (To boost their ego). And ppl who want to look more realistic (looking at PVP gear).<br />
<br />
But Blizzard does have its own style, and some sets do really look cool, and weird at the same time. I just love the T8 for hunters.<br />
<br />
To quote Blizzard:<br />
Under the current design philosophy, the idea is that in PvE you're killing very rare and challenging creatures of Azeroth, while in PvP you're receiving gear from the crafters (so to speak) of your faction to get you battle-ready. Chances are you're going to be given the gear that'll get the job done rather than the gear that has to be constructed entirely out of the nipples of a 7,000 year-old dragon.</div></div><hr />

This is a good thing, since Furious Howl didnt even work in raid because it didnt stack with other AP increasing buffs (yet it did waste the focus). <br />
Also last 20 sec, 20 CD having it up all the time is nais. Hope this buffs the hunter/pet AP stacking with the Warr/Pala AP buffs, else this ability is just worthless (as it was before). Would be a shame to ditch my demonic looking wolf..</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Um, the interrupt of every class is on a 10 second cooldown, and it's not on the GCD. Warrior Pummel, Rogue Kick, etc are on 10 second cooldowns. It's only the ranged spell locks that CASTERS have that are on a longer cooldown (Warlock, Mage). I assume you play a mage.<br />
<br />
A pet is part of the hunter CLASS, why should it be awful just because it's on a pet bar rather than an action bar (and TBH I use macros for all of my pet skills, so they're on my action bars too)? It's not like hunters are a complete class without their pet.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Are you retarded? YOUR OWN CLASS'S INTERRUPT IS A 4 SECOND SCHOOL LOCKOUT WITH A 10 SECOND COOLDOWN. Hunters were the ONLY non-healing class without any true spell interrupt, this change is great.<br />
<br />
Also, when did I ever insult you until just now when I called you retarded? I said you were a mage, since I assume all mages cry about anyone that gets a similar spell to them on a shorter cooldown. That's not necessarily an &quot;insult,&quot; though I guess you think being a mage period is an insult.</div></div><hr />

<br />
[Venture Co. Libram of Retribution] (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=38362) -&gt; instead of the Goblin Justice buff from before it just adds +81 dam to Divine Storm :(<br />
Swift Retribution -&gt; not tied to Ret aura, even though the talent says it is. (Bug? About to be rolled into Sanctified Retribution? Who knows?)<br />
<br />
Anybody else concerned that a person could take every talent in the Ret tree (even the PVP talents and deflection) and still have enough points left over to get Divine Strength? I know they wanted to slim the trees down, but that's just insane. Especially with Crusade and 2hd Weapon Spec basically being the same talent. Basically. I mean other than the &quot;Lose 3% damage in Ulduar&quot; part of Crusade. Also Conviction (+5% Crit 5pts) and Sanctified Seals (+3% Crit 3 points) being the same thing. That tree needs a sandwich or something.<br />
<br />
As it stands, we have nearly 12-14 points left over after getting all the PvE DPS talents in Ret + Divine Strength (depending on your raid makeup with Imp. BoM). Make the Seal talent from T1 Holy work on SoM or something. Though 10% flat bonus damage isn't really a sexy talent, and it would further exacerbate the &quot;Ret has too much Burst!&quot; complaining. So I don't know.<br />

Well, the weapons can be replaced (Thanks for using the Claymore of Unholy Might btw Blizz.

The only caster item is a sword. That is beyond stupid. They should have made it a dagger so that all casters can use it. I don't like the fact that its going to be only usable by the mage/warlock.

They are designed to allow those that made alts to take an alternative route to gearing those alts then grinding heroics or doing naxx10. This happened all through TBC, so I don't know why people are complaining about it now.</div></div><hr />

You can't have both. If you would notice they lists the races on the mounts. The raptor is for horde. The horse is for alliance. The horse looks like they just gave away the paladin horse to just anyone. Go Blizzard!</div></div><hr />

<br />
What you said was right on. You forgot the part where every single change made to warlocks and priests is a nerf. They could give warlocks and priests touch of death which allowed them to kill one raid boss for free every week and the warlocks and preists would complain that it was on a 1 week cool down and call it a nerf because any touch of death spell should be on a 1 hour cool down.<br />
<br />
Also, any set of gear that the paladins get must be ugly. They could give paladins the best set in the game and call it shaman till the very end then release it as paladin. All the oohs and ahhs from it being shaman would turn in oh that is messed up poor paladins we want T2 back posts. I guess that is what you can expect when some idiot puts a 10+ part video set on youtube called does Blizzard hate paladins and their only real points were the color pink was icky and not allowing paladins to be over powered as compared to other classes sucked.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It is a healing item. Any good dps caster dagger almost always has hit. They made a weapon with a decent amount of hit on it (which is very needed at 200 level) and then made that weapon unusable by balance druids and elemental shamans (the two classes that needed it the most) that is kind of fail.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Not really. Some of the best healing weapons in the game right now are swords. The sword that drops from KT25 is definitely a bis healing weapon for any class.<br />
<br />
<br />

I'm thinking he meant the horse that he CAN get, the forsaken warhorse. He didn't say so, but one can assume he aware he cannot have the Stormwind factioned horse if he's horde.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Actually the 2 best caster weapons in the game don't have hit. And 1 is considered a healing mace. Turning Tide and Torch of Holy Fire. Just because it doesn't have hit on it doesn't mean it can't be a dps caster weapon.<br />
<br />
Also that dagger can be a dps caster item. It would be decent for a SP or Boomkin, or even a Warlock now since they benefit from spirit. As for Elemental shamans it's not so nice.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It would only be fail if the level of effort required to get the items was greater than Naxx. If these are essentially just another set of L80 dailies, then there is no reason for the rewards to be greater. When they introduced Shattered Sun Offensive, it was similar... a few nice blues and epics in the revered and exalted rep levels, but nothing irreplaceable compared drops from the main raids at the time: MH, BT, Sunwell.</div></div><hr />

<br />
if a rogue is chain kicking you, his dps is taking a *HUGE* loss. not so much with the pet. shield (edit: bash) is the same way, but not only that but it requires battle / defensive stance, not their dps stance.<br />

<br />
Hit rating wise, you get the 10M KT dagger, and the 25M Trash dagger, the only stats on there that are redundant are Spirit when given to a shaman, everyone else benefits &quot;fully&quot;. But yes, it does mean you have to raid to get good gear. Crazy, I know.<br />
<br />
And inb4 some kind of comment about elemental shaman and balance druids, I have a 80 Ele Shaman (Tho currently thinking of respeccing to Enh to try it out for once), and I can understand the issues with hit rating on mail caster gear. We get 3 tier items, and 2 pvp items, that's it. There are solutions tho', personally, I looked into various cloth quest rewards and crafts, or instance drops and quest accessories that gave high hit rating. It's possible, and there are again gems and enchants which give hit rating, even tho they can be at times in place of BiS.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What kind of rogue has 100 energy? Oh that's right, none. They all have Vigor, 4 piece PVP, and/or Glyph of Vigor for 130 energy and PVP gloves for a 15 energy kick. That makes it 11.5% of one energy bar, and about a quarter of ONE mutilate, NOT ON THE GCD.<br />
<br />
You're fucking bad if a quarter of a mutilate every 10 seconds in return for locking out heals 50% of the time is a huge DPS loss.<br />
<br />
Hunter pets as survival only have about 16k HP unbuffed, so I don't know wtf you're talking about, but they can be killed just fine if you're not bad, and they don't have passive resists anymore, so they can also be CC'ed (read: kited) just fine.<br />
<br />
Why are you bringing up Shield Bash? It shares a cooldown with pummel, a Warrior would only use it if he's in Battle or Defensive Stance already. Warriors can pummel in Berserker stance.<br />
<br />
(Not even going to get into how Pet Focus regen rate is AT BEST half that of a rogue's default energy regen.)</div></div><hr />
