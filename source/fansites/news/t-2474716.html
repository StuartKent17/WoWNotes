Allied Races<br />
<br />
Regeneratin' no longer benefits from other effects that increase healing.<br />
<br />
<br />
Classes<br />
<br />
Paladin<br />
<br />
Fixed an issue that allowed Consecration and Wake of Ashes’s global cooldowns to be reduced more than intended by haste.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Player versus Player<br />
<br />
Players will now receive 50% more Conquest when participating in Rated Battlegrounds or Arenas until they have completed their 9th weekly “Conquest’s Reward”.<br />
The Tiger's Peak arena has been temporarily closed for repairs and will be returned to the arena map pool in a future update.<br />
Fixed a bug that prevented players from earning achievement Territorial Dominance.<br />
Fixed a bug that prevented eligible players from receiving the achievement The 5-Cap Crew in Arathi Basin.<br />
<br />
<br />
Quests<br />
<br />
Fixed a bug that allowed players to use the Avatar of Kimbul to eliminate members of the opposing faction if they abandoned “Wrath of the Tiger”.<br />
<br />
<br />
Raids and Dungeons<br />
<br />
King Rastakhan<br />
<br />
Fixed a bug that caused Death Rifts to disappear before the end of the encounter in Battle for Dazar’alor.<br />
<br />
Garalon<br />
<br />
Fixed a bug where players could be trapped like a bug after defeating the bug Garalon. It was bugging us.</div></div><hr />
