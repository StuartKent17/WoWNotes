Nomi is not that bad, he had a shitty teacher as a child and then on Horde side he was stuck in a kitchen that was too small with two other cooks. One of whom kept having his ingredients escaping. Running around, screaming, knocking things over. Calling for the guards, I'm a gnome not an ingredient! Shut up and get back in the pan!</div></div><hr />

Hopefully they can hold off on those for another week or two and let the bleeding edge grind it out before bringing this encounter down to earth for the mortal guilds<br />
<br />
Why isn't there a skip in this raid either? Like for the Guldan and Blackhand mounts. Need to farm that mount</div></div><hr />

chinese servers have different gear awards, different raid lockout, etc. they are purposefully left out of the world rankings because of this</div></div><hr />

They're only left off cause you have to add them manually</div></div><hr />

Wasn’t this featured on WoW’s front page for a little before the outcry on how furry it was caused a quick removal? Lol. I think the same thing happened with female Worgen around Cata launch, it was a beautiful piece where she looked like she was gonna eat a blue dragonet. Innocent unless you realized it was probably softcore vore :(<br />
<br />
As a person who draws a lot of WoW fanart shit like this pisses me off.</div></div><hr />

Considering bonus coin rolls on Chinese severs are 100% chance, because gambling is banned it would not be fair at all.</div></div><hr />

China climbed to 8/9 EXTREMELY fast, they're not entirely out of the game.<br />
<br />
And as for the bonus roll thing, no clue, no one has ever proven it. And China isn't as strict on it as people make it out to be. Remember their version of HS sells a small amount of dust with &quot;free&quot; packs.</div></div><hr />

IIRC they removed it because it WAS softcore vore. The artist if I recall had a DeviantArt where he had that dragonet (his fursona or whatever the dragon equivalent is) in various situations that were pretty clearly fetishes. The outcry was due to the fact it was fetish art.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I hope it's a sign of things to come! I've always felt that our pets (within reason) should have the option to function as mounts. Not as part of a collection of course, just the mechanic removing the pet from combat use until you unflag it for mount use ofc.<br />

Man I wish they'd visually update those Barrens lions... My very first one that I've had for a decade now (Sesam) rots away in a stable because I can't stand his pixel face and cardboard claws.<br />

<br />
I have the same problem with my Winter Saber (Frostbite). I refuse to get rid of him as he's my oldest pet, but I can't stand to use him with his painfully out of date model.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also - Tauren can wear clothes?! You mean I've been walking around naked for 10 years for no reason!<br />
<br />
Also: The Sequel - Best puppy is back! I have a reason to log into the game again!!!</div></div><hr />

<br />
In which alternate reality are there bottom tier ? Maybe on heave aoe burst for BM but single target dmg is pretty good, I won't complain, I dont have to top meters... no one can compete with current boomkins anyway<br />
<br />
I'm playing hunter since vanilla and I ALWAYS hoped we could mount our pet someday, but why only HAti ?<br />
<br />
Edit : are people SERIOUSLY complaining about the above image ? Seriously in all seriousness ? Omg.... If you think it's a &quot;sexual&quot; image then you have a BIG problem...<br />
