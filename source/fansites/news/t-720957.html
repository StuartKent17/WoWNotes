Remote Auction House Beta Test in Europe<br />
My plan to send horde of puppies to Blizzard's EU HQ worked and the remote Auction House beta test finally started in Europe. <br />
The World of Warcraft Remote Auction House beta test is now open for business! The Remote Auction House is a new service in development that lets players access the World of Warcraft Auction House from the Armory website (http://eu.wowarmory.com/auctionhouse/) or the Mobile Armory app for iPhone and iPod touch (http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=321057000&amp;mt=8). Players can browse their characters’ local Auction Houses with the same search functionality available in the game, as well as see the real-time status of each of their current bids and auctions.<br />
<br />
As we’d mentioned previously certain features of the Remote Auction House will be premium-based. Once the beta test is complete and the Remote Auction House is live, players will be able to subscribe to a new service called World of Warcraft Remote (http://eu.wowarmory.com/wow-remote.xml), which will allow them to buy items; post items for sale from a character’s bags, bank, or mailbox; collect gold from their bids and auctions; and more. During the beta test, players can try out these features for free, and each World of Warcraft account will be able to perform up to 25 transactions per day. (Please note this limit will be increased at launch.)<br />
<br />
For more information on the Remote Auction House, refer to the FAQ (http://eu.wowarmory.com/faq-auction-house.xml). We hope you enjoy trying out this new service, and we look forward to hearing your feedback in the thread below. <br />

<br />
Im not all too fussed on how the zones look, my main areas are the questing changes, how stats will work in cata and the talent/ability changes. Although i enjoy the lore im not really into that side of things like some others. <br />
<br />
That said, some of the screenshots of areas that used to be horrible look brilliant, which is great. Hopefully they will add quests in places that really lacked them. Also hopefully the quests are gone that involve stupid amounts of travelling for no reason (the level 17-22 stormwind quest that involves you travelling to stonetalon to randomly kill some enemies... i mean wtf?)<br />
<br />
Hopefully the NDA is lifted soon and beta testing/information can begin!</div></div><hr />

Used to be useful (15% damage, removed bleed effects, and i dont know if this ever went live but it was supposed to have a chance to refund energy).

Yea :-\<br />
<br />
I thought they learned from burning crusade, nearly all models were reused from classic.<br />
<br />
They always argue that they have the choice between new models and new raids etc.<br />

I get sent to the mobile armory for some reason and a search in itunes doesnt come up with anything new (mobile armory and authenticator). Seems like i have the same problem when going through the armory... weird.<br />
<br />
<br />
That's because there is no new client, they just activated the AH in the existing Armory app. Tried it this morning on QT realm, working fine, best bit I like is getting all the gold out of my mail from the sales. Don't think I'll be paying for it but nice whilst it's free.</div></div><hr />

It really shouldn't have been implemented at all. Unimaginative and boring (a term Blizzard used a lot during WotLK beta class changes but apparently forgot about HfB).<br />
<br />
I hope it gets replaced with a cooldown burst ability like Killing Spree. Assassination is pretty boring spec in some ways, no fancy cooldowns or anything exciting. Always been my favourite spec though (by a mile), mainly because combat feels slow and subtlety sucks just because it's subtlety.</div></div><hr />

Used to be useful (15% damage, removed bleed effects, and i dont know if this ever went live but it was supposed to have a chance to refund energy). Now its just a 5% damage buff that requires a bleed on the target and has to be refreshed. Thats not that great of a top tier talent lol. Not to mention its in a tree that doesnt even use bleeds lol.<br />
<br />
<br />
Do you have any idea what you're talking about? HfB is an 15% damage buff still. 18% if glyphed.<br />

Do you have any idea what your talking about? Hfb hasnt been 15% for a long time. If your going to try and call someone out, you should at least check the info first. Hfb was nerfed quite a while ago. L2think</div></div><hr />

Then when they added the glyph and reduced it down to 1 stack lasting 60s they made it even better because in season 6, HfB rogue/healer was like e-z mode 2300.<br />
Then people qq'ed about pve talents in pvp and they nerfed the crap out of it.<br />

<br />
<br />
See there's a few problems with Android. Fist of all, while it's true that Android outsold iPhone last quarter, it was by about two percentage points of the market. For one quarter. This means that Android may be (very, very) slowly overtaking iPhone in market share, but remember iPhone already has an entrenched advantage. 2% greater sales in one quarter is hardly &quot;a lot&quot; more popular. Hell, until it happens at least 2 quarters in a row it's not even &quot;trending more popular&quot;. <br />
<br />
Second, and probably more important, Android development is a lot more complicated than iPhone development. There are at least 3 major versions of Android in the wild, and at least one company (HTC) has a customized set of UI libraries. There are tools within Android IDE and store to to make dealing with these inconsistencies easier, but it's still more complicated than the unified environment provided by iPhone.<br />
<br />
Not to say that Blizz shouldn't start releasing Android apps. It is a highly popular platform with a growing market share. As thing stand right now though, if you're only willing to develop for one IPhone remains the better choice. Who knows where things will stand in a year of course.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
It was actually 7% but never mind.<br />
<br />
Also unless the iPhone 4G does something remarkable (video calling doesn't count as it has been done before successfully in the EU and Asia), Android will be going past the iPhone properly by the end of the year due to it having the advantage of more handsets. More handsets = more coverage.<br />
<br />
But meh, I just hope that the iPhone brings a slight bit of competition to Android so Google can keep up the awesome work. 2.2 Froyo looks amazing.</div></div><hr />

i liked HFB. It was a nice boost and easy to keep up. And it gave me something else to do besides spam mut + envenom. <br />
Someone a few posts above me mentioned something about how it sounds like a mastery bonus, and i agree. <br />
