A new virus spawned on the internet a few days ago and seems to be the first trojan capable of hacking a WoW account protected by an Authenticator. It was confirmed by Blizzard a few hours ago. <br />
After looking into this, it has been escalated, but it is a Man in the Middle attack.<br />
<br />
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack<br />
<br />
This is still perpetrated by key loggers, and no method is always 100% secure. <br />
<br />
Basically, what the virus does is fairly simple after you're infected :<br />
The next time you log in World of Warcraft, the game asks for your Authenticator code. <br />
The virus intercepts it, send it to another server, and sends a wrong one to Blizzard = You get an error.<br />
The people behind the virus now have a few seconds/minutes to use the &quot;real&quot; code while it's valid to change your password / empty your account / guild bank. <br />
<br />
How to check if you're infected<br />
Just search for a file named &quot;emcor.dll&quot; on your computer, it is most likely located in &quot;C:\Users\(Your user name)\AppData\Temp&quot; but I suggest that you check everything just to be sure. If you do find the file, delete it and make sure you update your anti-virus to prevent any further problem.<br />
<br />
To be honest, if you found this file your account is probably already compromised. <br />
<br />
What does it mean exactly?<br />
Yes, you can get hacked even if you have an authenticator, the chances are MUCH lower but you're not invulnerable.<br />
It definitely isn't an excuse to not have an authenticator. We're talking about a single virus here and the authenticator will save your ass 99% of the time. <br />
Get a decent anti-virus, buy an authenticator, you'll be safe.<br />

New Icecrown Citadel Quests in Patch 3.3.3 [SPOILER]<br />
Patch 3.3.3 added even more quests to the Icecrown Citadel! They all seem to be part of the same questline and according to the descriptions we can assume it will start from Item #51315 (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/51315/), most likely dropped by the Lich King.<br />
<br />
Quests descriptions aren't available yet, the description text for each quest is a transcript of the sound files. <br />
We can't know for sure how it will drop, the 3 possibilities are: A drop from the Lich King in 25-Man Heroic Mode, drop from the Lich King in 10-Man Heroic Mode, Shadowmourne extra quest rewards. <br />
<br />
Thanks to Tyrsenus and the wonderful users who did most of the work in this forum thread (http://www.mmo-champion.com/general-discussions-22/%28possible-spoilers%29-arthas%27-personal-effects). <br />
<br />
Quest - Quest: Personal Property (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/24914/personal-property/)<br />
Reward - Item #51316 (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/51316//) (Maybe the loot bag for the other items?)<br />
Description<br />
Bring the Sealed Chest to Highlord Darion Mograine in Icecrown Citadel.<br />
<br />
You can detect no hinges or openings on this box. Were it not for the shifting of items inside, it could easily be mistaken for solid metal. If anyone could know the method of its opening, it would be Highlord Mograine.<br />
<br />
Presumably, opening the box will contain five items, which the player will then return to their respective owners:<br />
<br />
Quest - Jaina's Locket (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/24916/jainas-locket/)<br />
Reward - Item #52251 (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/52251//) - Might be tied to Portal: Dalaran (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/73324/portal-dalaran/). (1 min cooldown)<br />
Description<br />
What's this? He... he kept it.. all this time he kept it! &lt;Cries&gt; I knew! &lt;Cries&gt; I sensed a part of him still alive... trapped... struggling. Oh Arthas! Perhaps he might someday remember from what he once was... By the Light may he at last find rest, free from the icy grip of that terrible blade!<br />
<br />
Quest - Muradin's Lament (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/24917/muradins-lament/)<br />
Reward - Item #52251 (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/24917/muradins-lament/) - Possibly a flavor item to transform into a Frostborn - Frostborn Illusion (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/73320/frostborn-illusion/) - Screenshot (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2010/february/frostbornillusion.jpg)<br />
Description<br />
Oh lad, how I missed those endless days in Lordaeron, sharpening your skill with this dull blade. Forging you into a weapon meant to withstand the demands of a great destiny. Heh… You sure put them skills to use, didn't you lad? If only I'd been able to stop you that day, how different things migha' been. If only I'da never discovered that accursed blade. Farewell, Arthas, my brother.<br />
<br />
Quest - Sylvanas' Vengeance (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/24918/sylvanas-vengeance/)<br />
Reward - Item #52253 (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/52253//) - Possibly another flavor item, probably tied to the Lament of the Highborne (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/73331/lament-of-the-highborne/) spell.<br />
Description<br />
So, it is done. I had not dared to trust my senses. Too many times has the Lich King made me to be a fool. Finally, he has been made to pay for the atrocities he imposed upon my people. May Azeroth never fail to remember the horrible price we paid for our weakness, for our pride. But what now, Hero? What of those freed from his grasp but still shackled to their mortal coils? Leave me. I have much to ponder.<br />
<br />
Quest - The Lightbringer's Redemption (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/24919/the-lightbringers-redemption/)<br />
Reward - Item #52252 (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/52252//) - Tabard of the Lightbringer (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/73326/tabard-of-the-lightbringer/) - Screenshot (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2010/february/tabardofthelightbringer.jpg).<br />
Description<br />
Arthas... Alas, hero of Azeroth. You give me a greater gift than you know. Long have I struggled to forgive the prince for his terrible transgressions. My soul has been wracked with unbearable anxiety, dark thoughts, distancing me from the light. I recall clearly... the gleam of pride in his eye as he stood before me, eager to defeat the enemies of the light... eager to defend his people, no matter the cost. It is this memory of Arthas that I choose to keep in my heart. I shall always be in your debt, friend. Thank you.<br />
<br />
Quest - Mograine's Reunion (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/24915/mograines-reunion/)<br />
Reward - Item #52200 (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/52200//) (Mount!)<br />
Description<br />
Alexandros: Darion, my son. At last I am able to lay my eyes upon you again. The Lich King tormented me without end, Darion. Endlessly he sought to break my will, to force me to serve him, to bind me to his blade. Finally, when events demanded his full attention, he left me. The one memory I clung to Darion, the one thought that kept me from giving in, it was your sacrifice, my son. That again saved me from eternal peril.<br />
<br />
Darion: Father, father, I… I feared for your sanity, father, for you, I would give my life a thousand times.<br />
<br />
The reward of this quest is most likely the Crimson Deathcharger (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/73313/crimson-deathcharger/) mount spell added to the game in 3.3.3. <br />
<br />
There is only one mount spell, but there are actually two new deathchargers creatures Azure Deathcharger (http://db.mmo-champion.com/c/39045/azure-deathcharger/) and Crimson Deathcharger (http://db.mmo-champion.com/c/39046/crimson-deathcharger/), we can assume that the color will change depending on the player's faction. <br />

So long as people don't download silly things off of the interwebz and keep a virus-scanner up-to-date (y'know, the basic rules of the Internet) there's really not much to worry about.</div></div><hr />

This was added along with the other quest rewards.<br />

Maybe Jaina's locket gives us a portal?<br />

However, that does not mean there will never been one that targets the Mac. As always, users should be highly suspicious of any attempts by 3rd party software to elevate privileges by throwing up a screen which requires you to re-authenticate as an administrator. Unless you are installing legitimate commercial software or merely changing System Preferences via your own initiation, you are not wise to grant credentials.</div></div><hr />

there are still 4 buffs in the gamefiles wich empowers arthas(blood,unholy,...) so maybe we see some yogghardmode mechanic in a few weeks(months?) at the arthas encounter and rewards you with the chest?</div></div><hr />

And even so, it would require the person to be active at the time you're logging in and they only got a small window to work with.<br />
<br />
So again, keylogger issue - same security measures as usual.<br />
<br />
<br />
I suppose Blizzard's next step to up the security somewhat with regards to the authenticator... if the immediate IP address for logging in don't match for the IP address on authenticator code request should deny access to the account.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As everyone always said... they still need to get your code and do everything in a few seconds... they're better stealing your authenticator personally, lol.<br />

And all that can be fixed really easy by blizzard on their login checking as people alread said.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also known as a replay attack.<br />
<br />
I just learned about this in Cisco. Basically it means that the network that Blizzard/AT&amp;T uses to run WoW on doesn't have their WAN connections secured, or at least not completely secured. This is usually remedied with authentication (pap, chap) being configured between routing devices within their network. Without authentcation/encryption measures in place, a hacker can intercept network traffic and modify it so that the receiving device will send information back to the hacker. <br />
<br />
I'm just going for my vanilla CCNA, so that's all that was covered in the text.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't be surprised if this was an inside job.<br />
<br />
Now I see why my teacher said that CCNA Security certs are in high-demand. Without a doubt, the CCNA security goes in-depth with stuff like this.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
How so?<br />
<br />
Is there even one pro-authenticator individual who's smart enough to grasp how herculean of a task it would be to produce and ship 11,5 million authenticators all over the world? Or that only about 1 million WoW players have smartphones?<br />
<br />
Even if they shipped in Cataclysm boxes, the bulk (75%) of WoW accounts were purcharsed digitally. There simply will never be enough authenticators for all the players in the game for the next 2 years.<br />
<br />
Might as well learn how to keep your computer safe now, which is a skill you'll undoubtedly need long after you stop playing the game, than having little devices hold your hand all the way through life.<br />

<br />
Anyone who thinks they will ever be 100% safe (with or without an authenticator) is misguided. You are never 100% safe from being hacked if you are connected to the internet and your connection works at all.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">andy_mitchelluk</div><div class="date">2010-02-28, 03:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The thing with the authenticator hack though is that the person on the other end has to be constantly watching their computers for someone attempting to log in with an authenticator, then they get like 30 seconds to use your authenticator code.<br />
<br />
The odds of this happening can be quite high but nowhere near as high as you being hacked without an authenticator.<br />
<br />
It still increases your safety at login.<br />
<br />
Just remember to do regular virus scans and grab something like SpyBot (http://www.safer-networking.org/en/mirrors/index.html) and scan on a regular basis with that as well.<br />
<br />
It is ENTIRELY possible to get a trojan/keylogger without your even knowing. You don't always have to click something for it to install as don't forget, hackers are almost always one step ahead of any circumventions made.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The network that WoW runs on is managed by AT&amp;T. I'm just saying it's a possibility. <br />
<br />
A replay attack takes place on a WAN connection, so which WAN connection was compromised, the customer's or AT&amp;T? How many accounts were compromised exactly? <br />

He is at Light's Hammer inside ICC but he's not standing next to Tirion Fordring in the center area. He's standing on the platform to the left, so it is possible to turn in the quest without being a Death Knight, provided being a Death Knight isn't a restriction. <br />

Except, they can't remove the authenticator by just having your new code. There's a serial number that's completely inaccessible without physical access, if you're using the physical authenticator and not the mobile one.<br />
<br />
Here's the thing: if they can't get into the game, THE REAL KICKER is that they won't be able to access Account Management. Leaving basically everything up to the person responsible for planting emcor.dll. As long as he is watching within the time limit of any given code.<br />
<br />
Fact is, the person has to be waiting for the exact 30 seconds to 2 minutes of the moment your code was entered, and then know your BNet name and password along with the code in order to gain access.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Blizzard can be vigilant with updating their encryption, but there's not a whole lot they can do when you let a virus onto your system and that virus reads information from your memory and redirects traffic however it likes.<br />
<br />
It's more like players need to understand that an authenticator is only a part of the solution. People who think 'I have an authenticator, I am invincible&quot; are about as stupid as the people who say &quot;I never go to suspicious sites, I am invincible&quot; or &quot;I have anti virus software, I am invincible.&quot;<br />
<br />
The only way to be safe is to take multiple precautions. Have a firewall, have an updated anti virus, have an authenticator, and pay attention to what you click and where you browse. If you think that only one or two of those things will be enough, well, eventually you'll be wrong.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The hacker does need to be &quot;online&quot; when you try to log in in order to use the authenticator code, but that part can be automated, and for such a sophisticated attack, that's trivial to do. You could even run a sweat shop like most of these gold seller/hackers already do. Joe Chinaman or Joe Russki is sitting at a terminal waiting for the trojan to pass him an account, and when it does, he's logged in automatically, and all he has to do is to quickly get the loot off the account onto a friendly mule. The guy robbing the account doesn't need to even know the account name or password.<br />
<br />
There is no chance of the actual user kicking the hacker off, because the actual user's correct information is never going to get to the Blizzard servers. The user doesn't even know that he's being hacked, per se, only that he can't log on. The server only knows that the user successfully logged on (actually the hacker, but the server doesn't know that).</div></div><hr />

Indeed, even if they hack someone with authenticator, you can just try to log in again, no need to go through authenticator code step, just your normal password and that will result in dc + 24h ban on account, plenty of time to sort things out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Only if you log in from a different PC. If you log in from the infected PC, you never connected to the Blizzard server the first time, and you won't on the second or third try either.<br />
<br />
As far as the server knows, you tried to log in one time, and you succeeded.</div></div><hr />

Then one day I got hacked. Know why? Because I visited a Blizzard fan site, which was linked to by a blue post, from the official blizzard forums. I read a totally legitimate article about the upcoming Wrath of the Lich King expansion, and while I did that, my browser was being exploited by a flash vulnerability through an advertisement embedded in the page.

What you dont understand is that you are indeed connected to Blizzard. The hack just send your code to them and switches it with a fake code which goes to Blizzard. Therefore the fail on login.<br />
<br />
You can pretty much just spam login and they wont be able to do nothing. Even if the same auth code is still valid. Unless, ofcourse wont work if they change your password. Something that is a risk for them seeing as they then use one of the recieved codes and its no longer useable.</div></div><hr />

Yes, if I go bang a random chick without any protection and find out later that it has brought me an STD - then I know very well that I'm an idiot.<br />

That's a very good analogy, but you got the second part a bit wrong.<br />
<br />
You're obviously not an idiot if you use a condom to not get STDs (which btw ain't completely sure either). The alternative is to get a recent medical report verifying that's she's clean, signed by her doctor (and your lawyer, to add an extra dimension of security :P).<br />
But deciding that all that is too much work and just use a condom instead, doesn't make you an idiot in my book.</div></div><hr />

You DO know that you still need your password with your authenticator? If it was required that you need a PIN on top of everything, it would just make things harder for everyone without actually helping anything.<br />
<br />
Problem is not that authenticator is flawed. It's perfect, or at least as perfect as it gets. The users are the problem. I've seem so many people who buy authenticator and assume that now their wow account is perfectly safe and they don't ever need any kind of virus protection or common sense while browsing in the internet.

A new virus spawned on the internet a few days ago and seems to be the first trojan capable of hacking a WoW account protected by an Authenticator. It was confirmed by Blizzard a few hours ago. <br />
After looking into this, it has been escalated, but it is a Man in the Middle attack.<br />
<br />
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack<br />
<br />
This is still perpetrated by key loggers, and no method is always 100% secure. <br />
<br />
Basically, what the virus does is fairly simple after you're infected :<br />
The next time you log in World of Warcraft, the game asks for your Authenticator code. <br />
The virus intercepts it, send it to another server, and sends a wrong one to Blizzard = You get an error.<br />
The people behind the virus now have a few seconds/minutes to use the &quot;real&quot; code while it's valid to change your password / empty your account / guild bank. <br />
<br />
How to check if you're infected<br />
Just search for a file named &quot;emcor.dll&quot; on your computer, it is most likely located in &quot;C:\Users\(Your user name)\AppData\Temp&quot; but I suggest that you check everything just to be sure. If you do find the file, delete it and make sure you update your anti-virus to prevent any further problem.<br />
<br />
To be honest, if you found this file your account is probably already compromised. <br />
<br />
What does it mean exactly?<br />
Yes, you can get hacked even if you have an authenticator, the chances are MUCH lower but you're not invulnerable.<br />
It definitely isn't an excuse to not have an authenticator. We're talking about a single virus here and the authenticator will save your ass 99% of the time. <br />
Get a decent anti-virus, buy an authenticator, you'll be safe.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
It was just a matter of time before Authenticator Protected Accounts got hacked!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Oogzy</div><div class="date">2010-02-28, 06:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You know, this was described terribly compared to how it actually works. He didn't explain what is making it so that they can get past the authenticator and explained it terribly. I'm a fan of Boubouille but I'm going to correct him on a couple things here:<br />
<br />
First off, the exact virus is a .dll file. The name of this file is emcor.dll and it is generally found under &quot;users/username/appdata/temp.&quot; That's where damn near everyone has found it so far. <br />
<br />
Second, this man-in-the-middle attack will tell you that your information is invalid by telling the wow.exe client (not Blizzard) that the information you entered is wrong. As soon as this happens the hacker will have access to your account and will be on at the exact time that you entered it. The only way this works is if he is there at his computer when you enter this for him to get on your account, so the chances of this happening to you are pretty slim. This is a real time attack, not a keylogger. <br />
<br />
Third is that the hack only works while the file is on your computer. As SOON as you remove it, you can access your account again and kick him off, but not before as it attacks your wow.exe and the information you enter at the battle.net website. It does nothing else. It is not a Vasco (company that makes the authenticators) hack at all but a file that attacks wow.exe and your web browser when going to Battle.net.<br />
<br />
I would do a full system scan for emcor.dll to see if you have it. Also if you do have it, I would highly suggest to delete the emcor.dll file and change your password to be on the safe side. I hope Boubouille will look into this more and give people more direct info. Nothing can happen to your account until you actually log in according to how this man-in-the-middle attack works and is probably very similar to the hack that was recently used for over 400 banks recently. It is not a back for Blizzard or for Vasco but a simple man-in-the-middle hack. Because of how this works, there is still absolutely no reason to not get an authenticator. This is a great scare tactic though and will probably get many to not get one, even though it's still by far in your best interest. Especially when Blizzard finds a way to have this file no longer attack their website and the wow.exe. So please don't be foolish enough to think that you don't need an authenticator. You should still get one.</div></div><hr />

No because you and only you knows a PIN, and since the authenticator is a random number generator that changes every 60sec, there is no chance match them up. It works trust me, otherwise the largest 2 factor security company RSA would be out of business.</div></div><hr />

I have a complicated password that I and only I know as well as an authenticator. I type in my password, then the authenticator number.

<br />
The Trojan does not hack your authenticator. The authenticator is not connected to any form of network, the only way it is going to be hacked is by you taking it apart in real life. The weak link in the security system still and always has been you and your actual computer. <br />
<br />
This Virus is not like a keylogger, these hackers have to be doing this in REAL TIME, so already your chance of having this happen to you is decreased exponentially. Also this form of Trojan is extremely dangerous, and has been around for a long time, hackers are just finding new uses for it. This Virus isn't like an automated system that just grabs all your information and tosses into a database of stolen information, this virus is an actual user on the other end, so if your being hacked, any information you are typing in on your computer is deffinitly going to be stolen and used. Hackers take a big risk using this type of virus because it links there computer to you, which on there part is a LOT of risk versus, in many cases very little reward. So hackers using this to find out your blizzard authentication code is probably only a very small part of what there looking to take from you, so be careful!<br />
<br />
So yes as an authenticator user, and simple as a computer user connected to the internet you should always take the best steps to protect your computer and your personal information. As a WoW player the authenticator is still the absolute best way to protect your wow account from being hacked, this Virus should not turn anyone away from increasing there Account Security with authenticator. <br />
<br />
Also if you do not have a virus scan I highly recommend the following, all of the ones linked below offer an incredible Free version, and some of the best paid virus protection available. I personally Use AVG and Spybot.<br />
<br />
AVG AntiVirus (http://free.avg.com/us-en/homepage)<br />
Ad-Aware (http://www.lavasoft.com/)<br />
Spybot S&amp;D (http://www.safer-networking.org/en/spybotsd/index.html)<br />
<br />
<br />
Hope this helps quell some of the major concerns and help get more people virus protected.</div></div><hr />

/facepalm<br />
<br />
A PASSWORD AND A PIN ARE THE SAME THING.<br />
<br />
Unless you hand your password to some one else, you're the only one who knows it. Same for the authenticator, because it's generated in realtime according to an algorithm that's virtually impossible to brute force.<br />
<br />
The whole point of this attack is that it takes that info directly from your client as you enter it. Once your client (your PC) is compromised, there is no way to prevent this attack from occurring until you remove the offending file. By the time you even realize that there might be a problem (because you can't log in) the hacker is potentially on your account, looting it.</div></div><hr />

Get off your high horse and accept the fact that noone is completly secure, even if you're cautios. The fact remains, that an authenticator drasticly increase the effort needed to get controle of your account.<br />
<br />
Blizzard could improve upon their security model as it's clearly not made with this kind of attack in mind. It is possible for them to prevent it, but as with everything else, it only makes it more difficult, not impossible. What I'm thinking of here, is that their communication with the authentication-servers is vunerable and/or they haven't put an effort into masking and encrypting the appropiate data in the RAM.</div></div><hr />

No, wrong. Nothing on your end is getting through to any one but the hacker. The file that's hijacking you is spoofing an error message to your client to tell it that it can't log in. It's not coming from the server, because the server never even got a request. the MitM attack never allowed that login request to go to the server.</div></div><hr />

Pretty sure it's Boub who is wrong(gasp!). :P In that thread Boub linked to WoW-eu forums, a few posts explain what's happening. Type in your info, get the authenticator pop-up(or however it works, I don't have one.). From there, it sends the information to the hacker, who then uses it to get online. They then send send information back to your client, which is incorrect, which displays the error message, and generally crashes the client. Nothing on your end is actually going through to Blizzard, though. Goes to the hacker which goes to Blizz.</div></div><hr />

I put one on my account just out of paranoia, after my mother got her shit hacked into. There's an uprising of account hacks, even for people who HAVE heavy protection on their computers. My mother works with computers for a living, she knows better. I don't think every instance of a hack is about someone downloading stupid shit or logging into bogus sites. That's nonsense that cocky people spit to justify not spending a little extra money to protect themselves. I'll giggle like a rightful bitch when they get hacked too. (Go ahead, jinx yourself and say that it wont happen. Maybe it will, maybe it wont. Why would you even screw with that chance?)<br />

<br />
Consider:<br />
If you are infected, when you start up wow, the real version of wow starts up in the background where you cannot see it and a fake version that gives you error messages when you try and login is shown to you. Every key stroke and mouse move go to both the real and fake one. When you try and log into the real one, the fake one gives you an error message while the real one sends a video feed to the hacker who then does bad things™, all while coming from your IP. As an alternative, the hacker could let you play the game when you log in, but intercept the exit command, and instead goes back to realm select screen. After a certain amount of time (hopefully when your asleep) he logs in and does all those bad things™. <br />
<br />
The best Blizzard can do is limit the amount of damage a hacker can do:<br />
1. Any item you have equipped for 2 or more hours (or gemed/enchanted/ect) cannot be sold or disenchanted.<br />
2. All soul bound equipment that is destroyed can be recovered from any vendor up to 1 week later.<br />
3. Have an option to require entering your authenticator code whenever you make a large transaction (trade/mail money to another character on a different account, or by AH purchases). When you enter your authenticator code you can make additional transactions for up to 15 minutes later (as long as you stay logged in).<br />
4. Guild bank protection. When turned on, money and selected tabs withdraws require approval from another officer (who has been in the guild for a few days). To turn the protection off, the guild leader must either wait 1 day, or get approval from another officer.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
There may be some way for Blizzard to request authenticator passwords AFTER logging in, but after a short delay of some kind. Even if the MitM attack disconnects the user before the nonce is sent, the delay should cause it to reset before the hacker can use it.<br />
<br />
It's still not immune to a hacker emulating the process until the authenticator is requested, and then taking over. But this would require significantly more effort.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dairystyle</div><div class="date">2010-02-28, 07:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I look at an authenticator as an extra layer of security. It's not there to replace the common sense practices but to add to them. If you're stupid online or just lazy, an authenticator will only do so much. If you do what you should already and use an authenticator it reduces more the odds of being hacked.<br />
<br />
It's like being a safe driver. You can use all the rules of the road (or internet &quot;information super highway&quot;) and some moron with a SUV (hacker/malware) can still broadside you and it never be your fault. You didn't run the red lights or drive into the seedy part of town. This guy just had it in for you. Wearing a seatbelt (antivirus, antispyware) helps but having an airbag (or in this case, authenticator for WOW) can save you that much more pain from losing everything.<br />
<br />
Anyone arrogant enough to say &quot;I don't need an authenticator&quot; is being extremely ignorant. Saying others who choose to use more safety as a precaution are just asking for someone to come hacking them and their &quot;safe&quot; practices and make a fool of their bravado.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I wouldn't say I'm ignorant because I don't believe I need an authenticator. I have taken enough precautions to make sure nothing gets access to my system, and if it did, I have more things in place to remove it, including my own knowledge of malware. I'd just rather not spend my money on something that I know will only annoy me. I do, however, believe that others should most definitely be using an authenticator, at least if they don't have the extensive amount of knowledge in this area that others do.</div></div><hr />

Greed and stupidity rule in WoW. You either get the virus from &quot;free gold/lvling&quot; emails, or from random people asking for ALL your account details.<br />
<br />
I had an email from PayPal 3 days ago telling me my account had been hacked and i needed to log in to change my details. As i had not used it in 5 years, it bought up flags. My girlfriend recived an email telling her that her HSBC account had been hacked, and to fill in ALL her personal information (driver licence and passport numbers)... she isnt even with that bank.<br />
<br />
I delete EVERYTHING in my email thats not from my friends. If its so bad, then they can send it to me via the post. I only deal with my bank in a BANK, and if i get threats to close my account, i just go in an take a copy of the email.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Craze</div><div class="date">2010-02-28, 08:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I believe this hack is created as a proof of concept thing and not really a way to obtain accounts simply because the window to use it is to small.<br />
<br />
Lets assume the hacker intercepts the authenticator code. Now he has 30 seconds to use it. <br />
Sure he can log in but what happens to the player?<br />
<br />
If he creates a new code and logs in the hacker will be booted because an account can't be active from 2 different instances of the game.<br />
After entering a new code 3-4 times he realizes something is wrong and goes to change his password. Even if he needs to click the &quot;reset password&quot; button it shouldn't take more than 5 minutes to get that setup and login(booting the other guy on the account). <br />
<br />
So from the moment the hackers gets the login details he has about 30 seconds(password doesn't get changed) to 5 minutes (player resets pass through email). <br />
So that's 5 minutes to find your main characters and the characters on which you have gold. If you're anything like me and have a ton of characters he'll spend a good deal of that time relogging. So overall, while he could get lucky and log your main with all your gold, i think it's save to say that 5 minutes is not a whole lot of time and lots of things can mess it up. Making it overall not a profitable thing to do.<br />
<br />
Of course there's also the ppl that think something is wrong on blizzards end and go do something else and try to login later just to find their account has been emptied. <br />
<br />
So the main difference here is that the hacker has to be online at the same time as you. And because most of us play during peak hours he'll need quite a team to be able to keep up with all the stolen codes. <br />
<br />
Looking at things with this in mind i stand by what i said at the start of this post. Proof of concept hack but it won't be a huge problem because of to much random things. <br />
The only thing that i can see right now that would make authenticators useless would be a program that could break the algorithm after collecting a lot of code from a single user. But i highly doubt we'll ever see this.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not really. As several people pointed out, they've been hacked from going to &quot;safe, secure&quot; sites because the sites were compromised from a flash exploit or through cross-server scripting or any number of other vulnerabilities that no one can anticipate. I'm very cautious about what I do on my system (FF, noscript, adblock, anti virus, anti malware etc) and I'm better secured than the average joe with my internet safety but I'm not about to pretend that more security is redundant or that I'm safe because I don't visit gold farmers or use shady software.<br />
<br />
Hackers are always looking for a loophole or security vulnerability and they aren't exactly the first ones to go telling the vendor about the exploit or notify the anti malware businesses about it. It's only a matter of time before they find a way past your defenses so you must always be building them up, reinforcing and keeping your guard up. It only takes one little tiny chink in the armor for them to pierce your security and take everything.<br />
<br />
And, as it's been repeatedly said, just because it hasn't happened yet doesn't mean it won't happen to you. No one expects to be hacked until they find out it's already happened.</div></div><hr />

<br />
After my account got hacked (Stupid paladin is stupid?) a few weeks ago I couldn't agree more with Ryoushii here. And the only way you'd actually find this out is if those hackers you throw common sense at make you their bitch. Not everyone falls for the obvious scams, but it doesn't make them (said keyloggers, hackers, etcetera) any less threatening. To ruin your day/week all they need is 3 hours at most.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
There is no perfect solution to this, you can only make it more difficult for hackers to get into accounts.<br />

<br />
<br />
These are all good suggestions, honestly. Anything that delays the damage done that's hard-coded into the game can/will lessen the damage done when people are hacked.<br />
<br />

While your suggestions are pretty good, your &quot;live feed view&quot; explanation seems taken from a movie/imagination. I can think of several other ways to make the user get an error message and give the exploiter (the man in the middle) access, and none of them involve fancy graphics and someone looking on &quot;your&quot; screen.<br />
<br />
As said before, this is likely to be a &quot;proof of consept&quot;, and I think more sofisticated attacks are yet to come.</div></div><hr />

As for hacking / cracking and even the groups that upload movies it's more about being the first to do it. A huge part of this community does it just because they like breaking something or competing to release a movie first. It usually doesn't have a lot to do with making money.<br />
It's about thinking outside the box. You have something that is supposed to do this and you want to see if you can make it do something that it isn't supposed to do. You'll find that most hacked accounts get hacked by using very simple tools that have been used for years. Think about phishing sites. The whispers you get ingame that you won a spectral tiger and you get a code to enter on some website. <br />
The chance you'll ever get hacked is relatively small if you can see through whispers and emails like this.<br />
<br />
As for the guy saying that keylogging isn't really hacking. I have to agree to some extend. <br />
Because you're not actually breaking anything. Everything works as it's intended. (yes this means the keylogger as well)<br />
Keyloggers belong in the spyware category together with tracking cookies and such.<br />
Sure you could argue about the deployment of keyloggers but in my experience it's probably save to say that the majority of keyloggers are installed after you consciously downloaded a file that was infected.<br />
<br />
About the people laughing at this saying authenticators do fuck all. They help a lot because they limit the window in which an account can be comprised by a lot. <br />

I would say this is true. Alot of hackers that are good (meaning they are good at what they do. Which might be programing and so on) want to be known as the best. Like wow players they want to have a world first and so on. The same goes for hackers. But also hackers do get jobs for company's they hack and so on. Some times about money some times not. Who can guess. But the person who did this virus is a msart person or they just know how to work with a system to do what they want which is still smart. I would like to talk to them. Since I am taking computer forensics classes.</div></div><hr />

There is no silver bullet when it comes to safety. Redundant and updated security measures are always your best bet. Get an authenticator, get a good antivirus, get a script blocker for your browser, keep everything up to date, and run regular checks.<br />
<br />
But even these things will not make you 100% safe, because no such thing exists. As long as two computers need to communicate information, there will be those diligently searching for new ways to intercept, read, and possibly tamper with that information. The most you can do is minimize your risk.<br />

What &quot;own key&quot; are you talking about?<br />
A user with an authenticator already has 2 &quot;own keys&quot;. 1 is his password and one is the random clock in the authenticator. <br />
The way this hack works is that it just reads keystrokes in real time, changes the code you put in and send that to the server. In which case the server responds with an error telling you the code is wrong.</div></div><hr />

The &quot;own key&quot; is a encryption key defined when the account in created...

<br />
The biggest problem with security is just allowing everyone to login from anywhere on any machine. <br />
If you want to make this more secure you'd need to make either of these things unique. Be it with a token on the machine the user is using or limiting the account to only connect from a certain IP. <br />
Of course this would make things way to complicated.<br />
Encryption wouldn't really help if the attacker can just read your keystrokes. <br />
<br />
What blizzard could do is check if a succesful login occurs from a different IP right after a failed login. This would make things a whole lot more complicated.</div></div><hr />

I'd say pretty much everyone says this....until they get hacked. As has been responded too, tons of software avail and on computers, java, flash, etc... have and probably will again have vulnerabilities that can and will be exploited.<br />
<br />
An authenticator is just another level of protection.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also add to those that say it's unlikely because of a small window of opportunity, and while true, and someone can correct me if I'm wrong here. They may not have to log into WoW, just log into battle.net, or your wow account and do damage that way and then be able to get control of your account. then you won't be able to log back in, but I could be wrong here.</div></div><hr />

Trojan != Virus<br />
<br />
A trojan acts like normal software while allowing unauthorized access to a computer (hence the name Trojan Horse).<br />

A virus is a self-replicating program that corrupts already present files.<br />

A worm is self-sufficient, self-replicating malware.</div></div><hr />

You're very unlikely to be hacked, but you'll never be hackproof as long as you're connected to the internet and using the connection (so sending data to someone or getting data from someone). It's impossible.<br />
No website is 100% safe.<br />
No file is 100% safe.<br />
No password is 100% safe.<br />
No login details are 100% safe.<br />
No antivirus is 100% safe.<br />
No security measures are 100% safe besides unplugging your computer from the internet and never connecting it again.<br />
All you can do is your best to protect yourself and accept that there is always a risk when using the internet.<br />
<br />
*sigh*<br />
<br />
Someone earlier also mentioned some security company that would be out of business if certain security measures weren't 100% reliable. I'd be very surprised if their licensing agreement (the thing you skip and click &quot;I Accept&quot; to) had a disclaimer saying that they were not 100% reliable. If they seriously didn't then somebody would've sued them into oblivion already.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As people have already mentioned rest assured there is no way to be 100% safe from a virus. Currently google chrome is safest browser and firefox without security plugins is probably the most insecure. Just thought id throw that out there.<br />
<br />
Anyway last I tested the keys do not die after 30 seconds. They last about 15minutes. You can generate a new key every 30 seconds and if you use a key then all keys created after it become invalid until you generate another key. Did that make sense?<br />
<br />
Also I would not consider this as a man in the middle attack and I don't think most people would classify this as one either.<br />

The way Boub explained it, the trojan has to send a fake token code to blizz instead of the real one. They don't receive what you typed, but I was under the impression that they did receive SOMETHING.<br />
<br />
If they don't, that seems detectable through Warden or something similar (if they still use Warden), because the WoW client itself would have to be hacked so as not to send out a login request.</div></div><hr />

Ez way to do this is allowing ur login page to send via another channel the info at blizzard that the person failed at login so blizz could authomaticly invalidate the number and disconnect the current session ...<br />

<br />
first of all, english isnt my primary lang. so if something is wrong sorry ;)<br />
<br />
<br />
I have an authenticator and i've used and ARP Poison and MitM attacks on neighborns networks, so i know a bit.<br />
<br />
Ok lets go, when you try to log on your user:pass:numer isnt sended to blizzard, that the reason of the invalid username box, its sended to the attacker who recieves the data in simple text, since he get the user:pass:numer he have 60 segs to log in in your account or the code expires, if this happen and u diddnt try to login again he havent the number again to login, therefore, the attaquer only can steal accounts while hes sit on his pc, if he is recording all text in a database and hes sleeping, when he wake up only have the user n pass, all the codes has expired.<br />
<br />
I was thinking a bit more, he can change your password to evade your login, but he cannot login again after steal you, because when hes gonna login again the randomcode is needed again, because to unlink the authenticator from the account you need the serial number printed in the back of the auth.<br />
<br />
if u guees that you are infected, dont try to login 10 times more, doesnt nothing, tell a friend to login your account asap to disconnect the attacker, and dont try to login again until your desinfected.<br />
<br />
btw, if hes recording wow, im sure 100% that hes recording the rest of websites such gmail, hotmail, anything that have login:user<br />

1. Alice sends a message to Bob, which is intercepted by Mallory:<br />
<br />
Alice &quot;Hi Bob, it's Alice. Give me your key&quot;--&gt; Mallory Bob<br />
<br />
2. Mallory relays this message to Bob; Bob cannot tell it is not really from Alice:<br />
<br />
Alice Mallory &quot;Hi Bob, it's Alice. Give me your key&quot;--&gt; Bob<br />
<br />
3. Bob responds with his encryption key:<br />
<br />
Alice Mallory &lt;--[Bob's_key] Bob<br />
<br />
4. Mallory replaces Bob's key with her own, and relays this to Alice, claiming that it is Bob's key:<br />
<br />
Alice &lt;--[Mallory's_key] Mallory Bob<br />
<br />
5. Alice encrypts a message with what she believes to be Bob's key, thinking that only Bob can read it:<br />
<br />
Alice &quot;Meet me at the bus stop!&quot;[encrypted with Mallory's key]--&gt; Mallory Bob<br />
<br />
6. However, because it was actually encrypted with Mallory's key, Mallory can decrypt it, read it, modify it (if desired), re-encrypt with Bob's key, and forward it to Bob:<br />
<br />
Alice Mallory &quot;Meet me in the windowless van at 22nd Ave!&quot;[encrypted with Bob's key]--&gt; Bob<br />

<br />
<br />
If you have a questionable file, just Google the filename. Generally the first couple of search result summaries can tell you if a file is good or bad. wbemcore.dll is a valid Windows system file.<br />
<br />
Now as for this dll, doesn't it contain somewhere within it the hacker's IP address or a domain name for it to report back to? Either way, it should be pretty easy to get them shut down (well ok, not always easy to do that, but it becomes a possibility anyways), in which case they'd have to move on to another domain or IP address, and all of those already distributed dlls wouldn't work at all anymore since they're trying to report back to an incorrect address. I suppose the alternative would be to have the dll report to an IRC channel on a major network, which could be more difficult to disrupt, but you get one IRCop who loves playing WoW, and hates account hackers and the place would be toast.<br />

Yeah, I'm just thinking out loud here, and I'm sure I've missed some other possibility, but I think it wouldn't be too easy for the malicious people out there to hide themselves completely without embedding a tor/onion connection in the whole thing, which would just needlessly complicate the whole act of ganking some guy's account.</div></div><hr />

1. Any item you have equipped for 2 or more hours (or gemed/enchanted/ect) cannot be sold or disenchanted.<br />
2. All soul bound equipment that is destroyed can be recovered from any vendor up to 1 week later.<br />
3. Have an option to require entering your authenticator code whenever you make a large transaction (trade/mail money to another character on a different account, or by AH purchases). When you enter your authenticator code you can make additional transactions for up to 15 minutes later (as long as you stay logged in).<br />
4. Guild bank protection. When turned on, money and selected tabs withdraws require approval from another officer (who has been in the guild for a few days). To turn the protection off, the guild leader must either wait 1 day, or get approval from another officer.<br />

Hacking into a WoW account won't. However thanks to people who buy gold, WoW accounts have some monetary value so it's &quot;safe.&quot;<br />

Someone already posted this, but here: http://www.worldofraids.com/topic/15642-authenticator-keylogger-source-fake-wowmatrix-website/<br />
<br />
Basically a fake WoWMatrix that google recommends (!), as well as a fake Curse and other specific addon sites. So I believe you still have to download something from these bogus sites to get it. What I don't like is that the first victim's NOD32 and anti spyware didn't pick up on it at all.<br />
<br />
Moral of the story is use your bookmarks and hope the legit sites never get hacked, and if you have to google one then triple check the url, and don't trust the sponsored links.</div></div><hr />

Ouch. Do you think when the majority buys a Mac &quot;hackers&quot; will focus on Mac? Take IE for example its not just because Microsoft tends to slack at security its also because a lot of people are using it as it is the standard windows brower. <br />
<br />
At least Blizzard is being honest. Most of the time they dont say a word about things like that and surely none of their tools can fail. &quot;i got hacked&quot; &quot;well, delete WTF folder and addons&quot;<br />
<br />
Ofc nothing is 100% safe, that must be understand. But i didnt think anyone would bother doing so much for a WoW account. Well i dont know its real worth but i thought the prices dumped because gear is so easy to get and people are richer than ever before.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Making the authenticator secure against man in the middle attacks is trivial. Blizzard hasn't released details of the attack, but it's unlikely to be a real man in the middle attack (given that the authenticator is a 3rd party product designed by people who should know what they're doing - unlike Blizzard). Instead, the attack likely relies on the attacker being able to modify the client endpoint rather than only being able to observe and modify bits on the wire. There is nothing that can be done to stop such an attack on any OS.</div></div><hr />

He got his account reset on friday afternoon.<br />
3 hrs later it was hacked again.<br />
so they didn't say anything to him except he was the first they had ever heard of that lost account with the Authenticator.<br />
yea right, don't want to cause a panic.<br />
<br />
all they did was say change your password and you will be fine.<br />
NO mention of something like this.<br />
Just search for a file named &quot;emcor.dll&quot; on your computer, it is most likely located in &quot;C:\Users\(Your user name)\AppData\Temp&quot; but I suggest that you check everything just to be sure. If you do find the file, delete it and make sure you update your anti-virus to prevent any further problem.<br />

DLLs are also for Linux and Mac, when used in applications written in Mono (C#). <br />
<br />
And file extensions rarely means anything. The reason to use a DLL is you can hook it into the load process of WoW, or load as a global hook on say, keyboard input (think keylogger).<br />
<br />
I probably wouldn't use a .dll for it on Mac, but it's still doable :p<br />
<br />
If anyone one should do it to disguise stupid users who think they're safe since it's a &quot;windows file&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also known as a replay attack.<br />
<br />
I just learned about this in Cisco. Basically it means that the network that Blizzard/AT&amp;T uses to run WoW on doesn't have their WAN connections secured, or at least not completely secured. This is usually remedied with authentication (pap, chap) being configured between routing devices within their network. Without authentication/encryption measures in place, a hacker can intercept network traffic and modify it so that the receiving device will send information back to the hacker. <br />
<br />
I'm just going for my vanilla CCNA, so that's all that was covered in the text.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't be surprised if this was an inside job.<br />
<br />
Now I see why my teacher said that CCNA Security certs are in high-demand. Without a doubt, the CCNA security goes in-depth with stuff like this.<br />

This is wrong in two places. I'm not sure if it's already been said, because I'm responding now before incorrect information becomes a meme (I'm already multiple pages to late sadly). Your CCNA training is narrowly focused on internal Cisco LANs (with good reason, that's what CCNAs mainly deal with). What you're not realizing is that Man-in-the-Middle attacks are a generic computer security term for any attack in which some software stack in between two other software stacks intercepts information. Normally this happens on networks, and normally it is the result of the attack vectors you describe in your post. In this case, the man in the middle is on your own computer. <br />
<br />
Just like networks, software on computers communicates with other software on the same computer through specific channels. WoW sends information to Windows (or MacOS) through these internal communications ports, and this information is in turn sent to the network, video card, etc. Windows send information to WoW through the same channels to give it data about keystrokes, network replies, mouse movements and such. In this case the man in the middle sits on your computer in between the two pieces of software watching the information flow by. It grabs the Authenticator data stream that WoW is sending to Windows intended for the network card, and then falsifies a reply stream saying that the authentication failed. It then takes the Authenticator info that was intended for the Blizzard server and instead sends it to a third party server. <br />
<br />
The second place that you're wrong is implying that this indicated Blizzard's network is inherently insecure. I'm not saying that their network IS secure, don't misunderstand me. I have no idea one way or the other. Even if this particular MITM attack were network based, remember that a good chunk of the authentication interface is going over the Public Internet. Even if Blizzard could be 100% sure of it's own internal network security, there could still be a MITM vector that grabbed data off of the public portion of the exchange medium.<br />
<br />
I hope you don't take this as calling you out or anything. You understand the basics of the most common form of MITM attack, and the way Cisco trains people it's completely understandable that you would not realize the term is more generic than you've been taught. Cisco does an excellent job of certifying people to manage its equipment; but it tends to focus almost entirely on practical, &quot;this is the Cisco way to do this&quot;, information. Often to the exclusion of theoretical knowledge that can be more helpful when you get into the real world and find out that not everyone uses exclusively Cisco gear :-)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
What does it mean exactly?<br />
<br />
* Yes, you can get hacked even if you have an authenticator, the chances are MUCH lower but you're not invulnerable.<br />
* It definitely isn't an excuse to not have an authenticator. We're talking about a single virus here and the authenticator will save your ass 99% of the time.<br />
* Get a decent anti-virus, buy an authenticator, you'll be safe.<br />
<br />
We shouldn't get anything, we trust on it that our account info is safe when we follow Blizz steps...alot of people who got hacked and got everything back just get hacked again.<br />
<br />
Even if you have the best antivirus you are never safe from this if the big boss Blizz won't protect your info...if a perfect antivirus would exist than hackers wouldn't be able to do shit. The reality is that everything is possible to be hacked and there will never ever be an unhackeble system.<br />
<br />
I understand Blizz has trouble dealing with it and i respect that...shit happens. What i don't get is that they got a freaking crappy customer service and they don't give any decent help to people who lost accounts.<br />
<br />
Lets say that out of 10 peeps only 4 know anything about pc's further than booting and installing something. They are screwed as hell.<br />
Basicly what i'm saying is that i don't blame Blizz for people getting hacked but i do blame them for not having any decent support for those who got hacked.<br />
<br />
PS: I don't even play this game for over a year now but i hope whoever does will have his account back one way or another.</div></div><hr />

If they encrypted the entire World of Warcraft session (ala SSH), it still would not prevent key loggers from grabbing the authentication data as it was typed into the keyboard, but they would be unable to interfere with the login session. Without the shared key, a man in the middle would be unable to grab traffic in or out of the WoW client. On the other hand, this would dramatically increase the load on both ends (especially on the servers dealing with billions of transactions ), which is probably why they don't do it. People on borderline hardware have enough trouble with latency and low frame rates.<br />
<br />
Edit to add: This would not help without an Authenticator, as a key logger would still just grab your password as you type it in and send it on to be uses later. Only the time limited nature of Authenticator codes would allow this to function.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
It's not that they're dumb, it's just that they haven't been informed and definitions change over time. The same way someone can use a bruteforcer and say they've &quot;hacked&quot; an account, simply because the term has changed now because of popular use.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, Wow.com has an update on the source of this and a little bit more info:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DrgnDancer</div><div class="date">2010-03-01, 04:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Simple solution: whenever Blizzard receives a failed login request to your authenticator account, it changes your authenticator number.<br />
<br />
That way when the Trojan intercepts your login info and authenticator number, it's useless b/c Blizz trashed that number due to the failed login attempt sent from your computer.<br />
<br />
<br />
I think this won't work. I'm not an expert on the Authenticators but I am pretty sure they work like this:<br />
<br />
1) Authenticators have a near perfect time sync with some outside source. On the phone version, they use the phone's time which is in turn synced with the phone's network and based off GPS time. The dongles, I believe, get GPS time for themselves with small satellite receivers. <br />
<br />
2) The number generated on your screen is a hash, created once every 30 seconds, between the current time and a unique prime number associated with the device or the software on your phone. <br />
<br />
3) The Authentication server knows your unique prime number and has the same time as your device. It generates the same code and compares what you send to what it thinks the code should be.<br />
<br />
The Authenticators are not on any sort of computer network. They aren't talking to Blizzard. Blizzard cannot force them to generate a new code on invalid login attempts. They are simply very stupid little calculators with very accurate clocks. They perform one calculation every 30 seconds &quot;$uniqueprimenumber(RSATransformedBy)time&quot;, then they display the result. While you might be able to do something more complicated with the smart phone versions, the dongles are far more common, and incapable of much more.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard hasn't released details of the attack, but it's unlikely to be a real man in the middle attack (given that the authenticator is a 3rd party product designed by people who should know what they're doing - unlike Blizzard). Instead, the attack likely relies on the attacker being able to modify the client endpoint rather than only being able to observe and modify bits on the wire. There is nothing that can be done to stop such an attack on any OS.<br />
<br />
<br />
It's still a man in the middle. It's just that the &quot;man&quot; is in the &quot;middle&quot; of communication between two pieces of software on the same machine, not two remote machines. The concept is exactly the same, it just works on the operating system's internal communications rather than a network stack. read my comment above.<br />

I'm super new to mac's, is there something I should be looking for here? I know I won't find a .dll so does that mean I'm safe? Sorry for a newbie question :D<br />
<br />
<br />
Yes and no. Yes you are safe from this particular attack. It was written for Windows Clients. No, you are not safe from this attack vector. It is perfectly conceivable that the same thing could be done on a Mac, but no one has. Generally Macs have two security advantages over Windows machines. First they are less of a target, because fewer people use them so Windows is &quot;low hanging fruit&quot;. Second OSX has much better sand-boxing and privilege escalation mechanics than Windows XP. Vista and Windows 7 have gone a long way in this regard, but many (probably most) people still use XP.</div></div><hr />

A MitM attack can be avoided by quite simple measures. For example you could just use the authenticator codes as an encryption key for the login information. This is more or less totally safe against MitM attacks since you have a shared secret key that the attacker have no way of knowing. He can still block the connection, but he can't log in to your account. In fact, they might even be doing this already I dunno.<br />
<br />
However, when the computer has access to your computer he have access to both your password and the authenticator key, the secret key. There is literally no way for blizzard to know that it's not you logging in.</div></div><hr />

As many of the other posters have stated, this issue was one many of us foresaw as a possibility. People who think they are 100% safe are usually the ones most vulnerable due to there false scene of security.<br />
<br />
Things to think about:<br />
<br />
- Authenticator gives you 30 sec window, so if the hacker isn't awake they cant hack your account. Um, if you have a code and 30 sec to use it ... what is stopping them from just logging into the biz website and just turning the authenticator off / changing you password via a script?<br />
<br />
- 30 sec, why not just log in again and boot them off ... wait a sec, if you didn't connect the first time ... how exactly do you think you are going to connect the second time to boot them? Do you think it would be that hard to just have the trojan block all attempts of logging in? Some of you just are not that creative.<br />
<br />
so, how do you 100% prevent getting hacked? You don't ... but there are ways of making it less likely to happen to you.<br />
<br />
- Get Firefox<br />
- Use NoScript http://noscript.net/<br />
- Get Antivirus<br />
- Learn how to use and configure your firewall<br />
- Think before you click<br />
- If your password for WoW is the same as THIS forum or any other website, you are wrong ... fix it. In fact, if any two websites have the same password, you should fix those as well. Use Firefox to auto-complete them and then set a root password to protect your list. This means if someone uses cross site scripting on one site ... they don't get the other sites passwords (or your account password).<br />
- Get a Second Email account ... if your email address for wow login is gofish@gmail.com, making a second one for forum / fan sites like gofish.stuff@gmail.com and then forwarding all email from gofish.stuff to the gofish account. This gives yet another layer of security against hackers getting your info from hacking a fan sight data base.<br />
<br />
Authenticators are not a magic bullet, but they do help. I personalty don't have one and will not be getting one any time soon, but it enforces passwords of regular (non-computer tech savy) users to be unique (not found on other forum sites that could have there DB hacked into) and changed regularly (every 30 sec).<br />
<br />
And if you ever meet someone who thinks they are 100% secure, laugh at them to there face ... NOTHING is 100% secure. Just because you cant think of a way something could be stolen doesn't mean other people lack the creativity and talent to steal it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
/*<br />
After bringing this issue up with some other malware researchers, we found a similar infection (earlier version) from November 26, 2009. This previous version also disabled DEP for Internet Explorer and made connections to a Chinese site.<br />
*/<br />
<br />
I located a copy of this trojan to see what it was doing. As mentioned before, the files are hosted on sites that are designed to look like legitimate sites. In fact, the downloads from these sites include the legitimate versions of the files offered. What someone has done is taken the installer files for these programs and transparently attached a PassWord Stealer (PWS) to them. I found 2 different downloads being offered.<br />
<br />
The first one inside a ZIP file was an executable that installed the malware. It was protected by using an installer program (most likely NullSoft Installer) and encrypted to prevent generic unpacking.<br />
<br />
The second one was packed with a simple Microsoft CAB package installer. This one included the Malware dropper as well as the NullSoft installer packed file.<br />
<br />
Once the program are runs, it creates the &quot;emcor.dll&quot; file in the user's TEMP directory (%TEMP%\emcor.dll) as well as the legitimate program as a temporary file. The real program is run and the user sees the program starting normally. In order to start up with every new program that is launched, the dropper adds the following to the Windows Registry. The emcor.dll file is also marked with the Hidden attribute to prevent it from being seen by the default options of Windows Explorer. The dropper uses a hidden command prompt window to delete itself when done. <br />
<br />
&quot;HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows&quot; == &quot;AppInit_DLLs&quot; = &quot;,%TEMP%\emcor.dll&quot; <br />
<br />
This entry tells Windows to load the emcor.dll into each program started. Below are some of the strings found in memory once emcor.dll is loaded. Mac users do not have to worry in this attack since the DLL file is made for Windows and will not load on a Mac version of the game.<br />

<br />
Based just on some of the calls made in this dll, it seems it was made specifically to detect WOW running and to block the application from ever really talking to Blizzard Servers. Instead, it calls resources inside the game client to display error messages while sending data about your account.<br />
<br />
This does not look to be a hack on the authentication method (TLS/SSL) but rather a hack of the game client on the user's machine. Since the module loads inside wow.exe, it potentially has the ability to control/intercept anything it does.<br />
<br />
Removal:<br />
This trojan virus could easily be turned into a rootkit by hiding its presence, network connections, files, and registry settings. As this point it uses almost no protection for itself to stay alive but this could change at any time. Since this malware does not protect itself, it is easy to remove by deleting the emcor.dll file and/or removing the registry change. Since the file could be loaded and locked by Windows, you could just rename the file and then reboot to disable it. For those that just want to have a program scan and clean your computer, I recommend the following two scanners that will detect and remove this threat. These scanners can be safely run with your current security solution and do not install permanently on your computer.<br />
<br />
ESET Online Scan (http://download.eset.com/special/eos/esetsmartinstaller_enu.exe): This is the easiest/simplest to use. Anything it detects will be removed automatically.<br />
Kaspersky Virus Removal Tool (http://devbuilds.kaspersky-labs.com/devbuilds/AVPTool/): For extreme cases and advanced users. This tool has self protection, anti-rookit/anti-hook technology, and malware discovery with automatic or manual removal methods.<br />
<br />
Mitigating Factors<br />
<br />
If you had a Host Intrusion Prevention System/Software (HIPS), the installation of emcor.dll into the registry could be blocked.<br />
<br />
Some of the better AntiViruses can detect and block the real malicious code, emcor.dll.<br />
<br />
A good firewall would have detected a bad module loaded and prevented network communications when emcor.dll is loaded.<br />
<br />
<br />
The Authenicator code is valid for a few minutes (despite the code changing every 30 seconds) and is only marked invalid once it is actually used on Blizzard's authentication servers. This means in order for this password stealer to work, the data would have to be sent and used within a few minutes. This greatly reduces the chance of success. If someone was to put in their authenticator code three times in a row, the hacker could use the first code to log into the battle.net account and then use the 2 other codes to remove the authenticator. Even with just 1 code, the hacker could have enough time to log in at least once and start mailing items away.<br />

That's right. Norton/Symantec/Insight as of this morning (Mar 1) do not detect any of the samples. I have submitted the samples to all major antivirus companies but it's in a queue for generic submissions.<br />
<br />
It's great to stop the virus as early as possible but since malware authors are encrypting their data, it's hard for scanners to know what happens until after the package in decrypted/unpacked. If anything, the AntiVirus must protect against the malicious code which is only the emcor.dll file.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Non-Free AV:<br />
Norton (http://www.symantec.com/) as of the 2009/2010 version are very good, but still will miss obscure/packed samples more than some other AntiViruses.<br />
<br />
These are usually my top two recommendations:<br />
Kaspersky (http://www.kaspersky.com/) is probably the top detector and protector for systems.<br />
ESET NOD32 (http://www.eset.com/) is probably the smallest, fastest, and most effective at detecting samples that many others miss without false positives.<br />
<br />
Free AV:<br />
Microsoft Security Essentials (http://www.microsoft.com/Security_Essentials/) - Free and Fast<br />
Avast Home Edition (http://www.avast.com/)<br />
Avira AntiVir (http://www.free-av.com/) - Probably can detect as much as NOD32 but generally has more false positives.<br />
<br />
Other Notes:<br />
Some other security solutions may use multiple engines like G-DATA and F-Secure. They might have a 1-2% detection lead because of this but I do not know much about the performance hit. Also, some AntiViruses include better generic system protection when something unknown is run. For example, McAfee Enterprise and Symantec Endpoint Security (not available to the general public) are actually really good but requires an IT person to set it up properly.</div></div><hr />

However, there is no reason such technology can be produced and distributed alot cheaper!<br />

No security is 100% but the idea is to make it so difficult and time consuming that it is not worth the time and effort to bypass the security. The Blizzard authenticator does that for most cases.<br />

After reading your updated post, I see that the methods used to protect against OS vulnerabilities were addressed. However, I still see that it is possible to hijack the data since the device is only verifying a secure connection to the server. If malware is on a system, it can be made to show the user anything or just connect to another server with your provided information. The ZTIC would only be there to confirm data sent to the authentication server was correct. Another security method like this ZTIC is called the YubiKey (http://www.yubico.com).</div></div><hr />

There are a number of viruses that specifically target windows pcs. This is a very small number relative to the total number of viruses that exist.<br />

Yeah, but kernel and BIOS attacks is a completely different league when it comes to computer security and hacking... After a successful attack on that level, there's pretty much little to nothing you can do...<br />
<br />
&quot;IBM expended a lot of effort to figure how to initiate an SSL session within a USB stick, Baentsch said. It takes some processing muscle, and since the USB runs independent of the PC, it does not have access to the computer's processor.<br />
<br />
ZTIC uses a chip from microprocessor designer ARM, and the software has been designed so it can quickly establish a SSL session, Baentsch said. Although it is a memory stick, no data can be stored on it, which also prevents malicious software from infecting it.&quot;<br />

One strength is that it will also discover attacks, and should in theory be able to boot the user (and making it impossible to log in again for a certain time frame).<br />
<br />
However, the costs related to this technology makes it unlikely that Blizzard implements a similar technology for World of Warcraft. It is simply cheaper to deal with hacked accounts (unless 12M players suddenly want to pay $70 to get a safer account).<br />
<br />
edit:<br />
I'll admit I have limited experience with this, and haven't spent enough research to state that this is a foolproof solution. But it seems like one of the stronger options available when it comes to online authentication today, and this is also said to be one of the best options available for online banking services today.</div></div><hr />

The hack in the original post worked just by key logging or monitoring input and blocking the connection to the real authentication server. With the ZTIC, if malicious code was intercepting the connection, the user should stop (hopefully) and wonder why the security token was inactive/invalid!<br />
<br />
Here is IBM's official video on the ZTIC: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPZrkeHMDJ8&amp;fmt=18<br />

In their demo, they are showing how to protect the connection to the secure server and validate the data in the case it was modified. The user is still entering information on the Malware Computer and seeing everything as normal. Hackers in these cases don't want to modify the data, but instead send it somewhere else without using the OTP.</div></div><hr />

Forgive me if I am slow here, but what good is the user name and the static password for the hacker, as long as he cannot use a generated one-time password to actually log in? I still fail to see how this is not strengthening account security drastically...?</div></div><hr />
