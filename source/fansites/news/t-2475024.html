In anticipation of the upcoming 25th anniversary of Warcraft, we’ve partnered with GOG.COM to rerelease the real-time strategy classics that started it all—Warcraft: Orcs &amp; Humans and Warcraft II Battle.net Edition, including both the original Tides of Darkness and the Beyond the Dark Portal expansion. Starting today, players can once again explore these universe-defining games as they become available digitally and DRM-free for the first time ever, exclusively on GOG.COM (https://www.gog.com/game/warcraft_bundle?utm_source=blizzard.com&amp;utm_medium=legacy&amp;utm_campaign=warcraft-blizz)!<br />
<br />
Warcraft: Orcs &amp; Humans takes players back to the original battle for Azeroth, challenging players to pick a side and raise an army of humans or orcs capable of bringing ruin to their enemies. Warcraft II and its expansion take the battle to the high seas with a host of naval units, and introduces more of the races that make up the Alliance and the Horde, bolstering the human and orc forces with elves, trolls, dwarves, and more.<br />

&quot;The maximum amount of Blizzard Balance you can have on your account is $350, or $110 if you don't have an Authenticator linked to your account.&quot;</div></div><hr />

They might have a deal with them to make them compatible with modern PC, it's pretty much their specialty after all.</div></div><hr />

They probably considered that the (huge) rework needed to adapt them to their new requirements (like working through the launcher, using new B.Net function and so on) was too high compared to how much they would make out of it.<br />

<br />
Do you need a Launcher for GOG just like battle.net i just an account and then download it to your PC?<br />
No, that's the whole point of GOG. It's ENTIRELY DRM-free, you just download an .exe installer.<br />
<br />
You CAN use their launcher (Galaxy) if you want, but it's not a requirement.</div></div><hr />

I feel you man. I'm a staunch supporter of GOG precisely because of that. I like that I can just store all my installers somewhere, knowing I can come back in 10 years and they'll still be fully functionnal and without requiring an Internet connection. Click install &amp; play !</div></div><hr />

True Akka, would have been nice to be on the official store. TBH it ended up in the second best place for it. Nothing wrong with GOG :) so a good choice.</div></div><hr />

GoG is glorious and all their games except for very few have ZERO DRM. The few games that do use DRM only do so for multiplyer reasons when accessing dev servers...naturally.<br />
<br />
As a hardcore Steam supporter, GoG is the only other platform I buy PC games on. The great thing about GoG is that you can download the installer and throw it on a thumb drive. Their site used to specialize in old games only. GoG stands for Good Old Games. <br />
<br />
I own 68 GoG games on my account and put many of them on older PCs I have repurposed and turned into retro gaming machines for kids in youth corrections.<br />
It is awesome to see them love and appreciate old school PC games they would never have been exposed to otherwise. My hope is they leave the facility and purchase them and use on their home PCs/laptops. GoG games work well on potatoes. There are a few modern ones that do not like Witcher 3 and what not.</div></div><hr />

By the way, I noticed we still don't have Cyberpunk 2077 pre-order, despite that game is probably only year away. Good to know they don't adapt to bad habits also here (member Fallout 76 that was pre-ordered by stupid people even before E3 and ANY information about it? or now Bloodlines 2, people buy cat in the bag again...).</div></div><hr />

Potentially, GOG actually did all the fixes. If that was the case, then the deal they made might stipulate that in return they remain GOG exclusives.</div></div><hr />

Wait.. Why is it on GOG only? Why isn't it available in b.net?<br />
As they said with the diablo release, there are certain aspects of the game that are simply incompatible with being added to the store or battle.net. GOG (A well known company for hosting older stuff and licensing) has people who -do- this. So they licensed it. The other option is not having it at all.</div></div><hr />

Sounds like a lazy excuse not to optimise your own launcher to include your own product, honestly. But eh, better than nothing I guess.</div></div><hr />

There is no 'optimization'.<br />
<br />
They have three choices.<br />
<br />
1) Don't release the game at all.<br />
2) Completely rebuild the game, as they're doing with WC3 (I can't imagine there is anything fiscally responsible about this. Which goes to show that they actually do give at least a little crap about the community)<br />
3) License it to a 3rd party company that literally -does this specifically- and release it on a different platform. It may not earn them much money, but the cost is virtually nil, and it makes people happy.</div></div><hr />

In anticipation of the upcoming 25th anniversary of Warcraft, we’ve partnered with GOG.COM to rerelease the real-time strategy classics that started it all—Warcraft: Orcs &amp; Humans and Warcraft II Battle.net Edition, including both the original Tides of Darkness and the Beyond the Dark Portal expansion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They have three choices.<br />
<br />
1) Don't release the game at all.<br />
2) Completely rebuild the game, as they're doing with WC3 (I can't imagine there is anything fiscally responsible about this. Which goes to show that they actually do give at least a little crap about the community)<br />
3) License it to a 3rd party company that literally -does this specifically- and release it on a different platform. It may not earn them much money, but the cost is virtually nil, and it makes people happy.<br />
<br />
I don't understand why though. I don't think people need the ability to speak with their battle.net friends in the game, if they just add the games to their shop and launcher without the bnet features. That would be fine as well. I'm more willing to buy it there, rather than on GOG or somewhere else.</div></div><hr />

If you buy Warcraft 2 and install it, you can choose to play it as classic (minus the expansion) or as the b.net version (which is with the expansion)</div></div><hr />

In simple terms, the game itself is not compatible with the setup of battle.net, and the Blizzard Launcher. It's like asking why your CDMA Verizon phone doesn't work with GSM AT&amp;T Service. Yes, they're all 'just phones' but there is a lot of technical stuff in the background that is below user level that makes them incompatible.<br />
<br />
That's why I presented the options above. They can either not make it, rebuild the game (which they won't, which is the same as not make it), or license to a third party.</div></div><hr />

GOG is run by CD Project Red who does the Witcher games. And the GOG launcher is basically only needed to buyu things from. You can run the games without even opening the GOG client.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Now, tbh, that is utter horseshit, unless you only purchased one game.<br />
<br />
I have over 300 games from them, and every single one, and I mean that, every single one, has worked excellently with no glaring issues, and even those issues have been patched regularly. I am also not alone in this by far, GOG is simply, for many, the best retro-gaming company out there by a LONG mile.<br />
<br />
The Diablo game they released last month has already had a multitude of patching done to help it work better on modern systems. GOG works overtime to make sure the games not only work, but work excellently.<br />

It's fantastic. Truly DRM free, optional client, no spam, bloatware or any of that garbage. It's the way things should be done IMO.

I've bought 2 games and neither of them have worked properly. Icewind dale 2 and kill krush and destroy 2. I put in reports for both of those games and never got so much of a peep back. So, call me a liar all you want, but fuck GOG for that.</div></div><hr />

I prefer setting up DOSBox and old Windows games (with dgVoodoo2) myself. Have the original games anyway.<br />
But I know what you mean, we had quite the complaints about how GOG handles updates for certain games like Divinity Original Sin 2, where they constantly removed updates and people had to redownload the whole game. Often they uploaded new versions so often, that you had to start from the beginning, if you didn't download everything within one day. They completely ignored these complaints and are still doing this BS. It's bad when you have to go warez sites to get your updates because GOG is removing them...<br />
In the end they are also just in for the money. Companies realised that people are still interested in old games, because of the success of the abandonware sites. GOG/CD Project saw, that they could make money this way. I don't get the praise for them, as many games could be downloaded for free before because companies didn't care about them anymore. Now they want you to hand over cash for 20+ year old games and it's still just DOSBox emulation.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Where did you contact them? Because everytime I contacted them (Wizards and Warriors mouse issue being the most recent), I had a representative respond to me both times within a 2 hour window. <br />
And define &quot;Not worked properly&quot;, because you have to have certain expectations when utilising what is basically emulation in some cases (DOSBox). Did you report the actual issue and ask to speak to a representative, or did you just file a bug report and nothing else? Because the latter won't get a response (they are actually still a small company).<br />
<br />
Sorry if you had a bad experience, but that is the most extreme example I have heard of in using them for a decade now. Very, very strange indeed.</div></div><hr />
