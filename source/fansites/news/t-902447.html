Classes: General<br />
<br />
All healing critical strikes now heal for 2 times a normal heal (+100%), up from 1.5 times a normal heal (+50%).<br />
<br />
<br />
Buffs<br />
<br />
All class abilities which place a buff on friendly targets no longer generate any threat. This goes for raid-wide buffs like Mark of the Wild and Power Word: Fortitude, as well as triggered effects such as Blessed Resilience or Fingers of Frost, and single-target buffs like Dark Intent and Hysteria. The exception is buffs which directly cause healing or damage, such as Thorns or Renew. Abilities such as these still generate normal threat.<br />
<br />
<br />
Pets<br />
<br />
The Aggressive pet stance has been removed and replaced with the Assist stance. This stance will cause the player's pet to attack the player's target. The pet will not change targets unless the master attacks a new target for a few seconds.<br />
<br />
<br />
Spell Interrupts<br />
<br />
When interrupted while casting a single-school spell such as Mind Flay or Frostbolt, players will now be able to cast dual-school spells such as Mind Spike (Frost and Shadow schools) or Frostfire Bolt (Frost and Fire schools). However, being interrupted while casting a dual-school spell will still interrupt all respective schools as intended.<br />

Lunar Shower has been redesigned. When casting Moonfire, the druid gains Lunar Shower. Lunar Shower increases the direct damage done by Moonfire by 15/30/45%, and reduces the mana cost by 10/20/30%. This effect stacks up to 3 times and lasts 3 seconds. While under the effects of Lunar Shower, Moonfire generates 8 Solar Energy, and Sunfire generates 8 Lunar Energy. The amount of Lunar/Solar Energy gained does not change based on the number of points spent in the talent, or stacks of Lunar Shower. Those druids who wish to delay transition in or out of an Eclipse state should now cast the one of their two basic attacks which will not move the Eclipse bar (either Starfire or Wrath).<br />

Wild Mushroom: Detonate can now also trigger Earth and Moon, in addition to Starfire and Wrath.<br />
<br />
<br />
Restoration<br />

Healing Touch, Nourish, Swiftmend, and the initial heal from Regrowth are considered direct healing spells for the purposes of this Mastery.

<br />
Ardent Defender has a new spell effect.<br />
Hammer of the Righteous mana cost has been lowered to 10%, down from 12% to match Crusader Strike.<br />
Judgements of the Wise now procs on attempt rather than on strike, which means judgements that miss can still grant mana. This is to help ensure Protection paladins are not starved for mana if they aren't capped on hit rating.<br />
<br />

Mana Tide now grants 200% of the caster's Spirit, down from 400%.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Soul Harvest has a new spell effect.<br />
<br />
<br />
Dungeon &amp; Raids<br />
<br />
The Firelands, a new 10- and 25-player raid, is now available for limited testing. Please visit the PTR Discussion forum for the latest raid testing schedule.<br />
<br />
<br />
Guilds<br />
<br />
The daily guild experience cap has been increased by 25%.<br />
The weekly guild reputation cap has been increased by 25%.<br />
The guild experience cap is now removed at level 20, down from level 23.<br />
<br />
<br />
Items<br />
<br />
Darkmoon Card: Hurricane damage done when triggered has been increased by 40%, however, it can no longer deal critical strikes and no longer receives any modifiers to its damage from the equipping player.<br />
<br />
<br />
Set Bonuses<br />
<br />
The 4-piece Elemental shaman PvP set bonus (Gladiator's Thunderfist set) has been redesigned. It now causes Lightning Shield to generate an extra charge, rather than consuming one, when it is triggered by receiving damage, up to a maximum of 3 (9 with the Rolling Thunder talent).<br />
<br />
<br />
Professions<br />
Skinning<br />
<br />
Players can no longer skin corpses already being actively skinned or looted by other players.<br />
<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
Conquest Points<br />
<br />
The minimum cap on Conquest Points earned per week is now 1500 at 1500 or less Battleground rating. The maximum cap remains 3000 at 3000 or more Battleground rating. The cap continues to scale non-linearly between those two points.<br />
The game now separately tracks different Conquest Point caps for Battlegrounds and Arenas. The cap for Arena rating will always be 2/3 of the cap for Battleground rating at any given Arena rating. Players may earn a total number of Conquest Points per week equal to the higher of these two caps, but once players have reached the cap for either Arenas or Battlegrounds, they can no longer earn Conquest Points from that source. Conquest Points from Battleground holidays only count toward the total Conquest Point cap.<br />
<br />
<br />
Quests &amp; Creatures<br />
<br />
There are no longer oddities in the critical strike and dodge chance of lower-level creatures.<br />
<br />
<br />
User Interface<br />
<br />
Raid Profiles are in the process of being implemented and are not fully functional. Raid Profiles will allow players to save the raid window user interface layout based on type of content (i.e. 10-player raids, 25-player raids, Battlegrounds, etc.).</div></div><hr />

Probably for trash pulls.. some people were spamming moonfire at the end of fights because they wanted to start the next fight still in Eclipse. You can´t spam moonfire anymore because of the eclipse change, so Blizzard is basically tell you to cast the ´wrong´spell at the end of the pull to prevent leaving eclipse if that is what you want to do.</div></div><hr />

Nah its a PvP nerf mainly imo cos of noobs QQing abt LSD when its abt the ONLY high power comp a moonkin has for the last hmmmmm......7 seasons. <br />
It just really shows how much other classes whine when they see a non-OP class finally getting OP at sumthing. WELL DONE U WHINERS &gt;.&gt;<br />
<br />
Now go QQ on Mages/Warrs/Frost DKs more so they get further nerfed like moonkins (who DONT EVEN DESERVE TO BE NERFED)</div></div><hr />

Honestly, i think some people have no clue about how things are currently balanced. I have also seen a moonkin state something similar about ´but we are already weak in pve, why nerf us´.. I think bad players just don´t realize they are bad, not their specs.</div></div><hr />

Bad players? Pls go read the druid forums and see how many moonkins are complaining abt our current state then actually go play as one too properly. I think u'll find us much worse than ur so loved Mages. And yes its the spec thats bad when TONS of ppl realise its flaws, not the players noob.</div></div><hr />

Then I go down to check if something happens with Restoration Shamans. Great the homogenization hammer hits shamans once again. Mana tide will be quite bad, therefor no reason to really bring shamans if you have better shamans of the other classes, that heals more.<br />
<br />
However. Paladins seems to have a rough time. Getting mana nerfs is not pretty. They will be COMPLETELY useless in PvP now. And they will certainly feel thenerfs in PvE aswell. But I believe they aren't totally destroyed there since if they heal tank the 2x crit heals will be quite useful if they can manage their mana really well and won't overheal all the time.</div></div><hr />

The change to Lunar Shower makes it sound like a Boomkin can now basically just run around and Moon/Starfire their way back and forth between states all they want. Sounds like a PvP buff to me.<br />
<br />
Ele Shammy buffs were needed.<br />
<br />
Spellsteal nerf was needed.<br />
<br />
Hunter traps scaling was needed.<br />
<br />
Feral buff I'm unsure of. Didn't they just get damage nerfs a couple patches ago? Didn't realize they were that weak.<br />
<br />
Holy Pally mana increases make me a bit sad, but they're not too bad and my spirit holds up so far, so I think I'll be ok.<br />
<br />
Double healing from crits makes me happy in the pants.<br />
<br />
Overall looking like a nice patch, mostly PvP balances, which I don't really care for as I don't PvP, but hey whatever evens things out.</div></div><hr />

What do they need to remove aggressive stance anyway? To keep the priest attacking something when shadow fiend is out? That sounds like aggro to me, which is a highly technical word. (http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_tmvEGRci_6U/Sm4hXI51r4I/AAAAAAAAACw/LqAUbM7nsqg/s320/priestdies.jpg)<br />

Changing defensive stance to assistance stance sounds more sense rather than scraping aggressive stance, you know.<br />

<br />
The mana tide nerf was coming. Guilds were starting to stack Shamans to use it. Thats never a good sign. Hope the nerf is big enough to prevent stacking.<br />
<br />
That doesnt change anything other than screwing 10men(I dont play 10 men anyways), for 25men they can still stack more shamans for more mana. If Bliz really want to fix it, they merely have to apply an exhaust debuff, like bloodlust or heroism.<br />
Sounds like more a pvp nerf to me. (but then, why dont they make spirit link out of arenas and rated bgs)</div></div><hr />

Frost was overtuned in PvP, just because it's ahead of Unholy in PvE doesn't make Frost strong, that's just how weak Unholy is.<br />
<br />
Revert this Obliterate nerf and bring Howling blast down to pre change numbers and you'll reduce the PvP damage output and keep Obliterate where it should be, right now we're risking the return of Shadowfrost.

The crit change doesn't change much for resto druids to be honest, its a nice throughput bonus but it wont change the fact that Haste and even Mastery are better for the simple reason of: crit is very unreliable compared to the other stats</div></div><hr />

not entirely convinced they realize that taking aggressive out is a big disadvantage against stealthed players<br />
<br />
rdruid mastery really didn't need to be reworked (though it was useless in pvp). holy paladin mastery is COMPLETE trash and their changes to it last patch really didn't do anything to fix that. paladins in general are in a pretty sorry state and could use some overhauls.<br />
<br />
balance druids... well, it's obvious they have no idea what they want that spec to do. instead of screwing with solar/lunar energy gains, increase the base damage from all spells, but decrease base mastery significantly while leaving the % gain per mastery point the same. The disparity between eclipse and noneclipse should be noticable, but not utterly gamechanging.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It was actually nice for 2v2 otherwise garbage compared to other bonuses except maybe pallys but even there's is a passive bonus, resto druid mastery required lots of extra casts and mana to get a relatively poor bonus.<br />
<br />
Only two reasons why you would take Mastery over haste, 1. cause your at a breakpoint for haste and don't have enough for the next breakpoint or 2. are doing 10's and still even then you should be reaching for the haste breakpoints if you can<br />
<br />
This change is fine for 10 mans as it doesn't change anything, but great for 25's cause of the extra periodic healing to all targets not just 6 group members. Also its stronger doesn't require as much mana (Great because of the recent mana regen nerfs) and is less gimmicky, meaning your not forced to cast spells in a specific order to get the bonus. Now you just heal like you normally would and get a bonus like every other mastery. Like i said its a bit boring but its a welcome change</div></div><hr />

Is that really the way to compensate the difference between a frost and an unholy? First there was the Ghoul with a dk pet, now theres a DK with a lazy bum ghoul. And there were frost dks making sure that no one else were at the bottom of the meters.<br />
Now that frost dk is quite viable and even more with a nice RNG, our main attack is being nerfed by 9 percentage points. Some might want to do some calcs about that. <br />
Can't really tell how's frost dk in arenas at the moment, but we're really not that overpowered in PvE. Just viable compared to other classes.</div></div><hr />

Having to be ability to steal the buff in the omnitron fight is a big part of that fight. <br />

Maybe change the mechanic of the spell. 6 second CD, but steals all avaliable buffs from a single target(stackable buffs inc) in 1 application. S*** make it a 10sec CD if it can remove all buffs with 1 application.<br />

Pls go read the druid forums and see how many moonkins are complaining abt our current state then actually go play as one too properly. I think u'll find us much worse than ur so loved Mages.

<br />
Sorry, but stateofdps.com (http://stateofdps.com/) somewhat disagrees. No more damage is needed at least.<br />
<br />
Out of all specs in the game, balance druids rank 3.-4. overall depending on which fights one chooses to monitor. Yes, after mages (by a whopping 200 dps on average when leaving Halfus out of the equation), but that's about it.<br />
<br />
18 specs are currently putting out lower numbers than Balance, most of them several thousands of dps behind.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nah mastery is still better, the crit change is a nice bonus but crit is still unreliable compared to haste and mastery. <br />
<br />
Crit will sometimes well give you critical strikes, haste will always give you more ticks, and mastery will always give you bigger ticks/hits<br />
<br />
Crit, at first glance, could be competetive for raw throughput (but still has the disadvantage of uncertainty). - Hamlet<br />

<br />
Having to be ability to steal the buff in the omnitron fight is a big part of that fight. <br />
<br />
Maybe change the mechanic of the spell. 6 second CD, but steals all avaliable buffs from a single target(stackable buffs inc) in 1 application. S*** make it a 10sec CD if it can remove all buffs with 1 application.<br />
<br />
thats just my opinion<br />
<br />
This is a 4.2 change, meaning you'll have all new raid bosses you'll be dealing with. I highly doubt it'll be that serious of an issue when it's a problem with a fight in a previous tier of content. At that point if you're having trouble killing Omnitron, it'll be due to more serious issues than not being able to remove a buff that's caused by players failing to change targets appropriately anyway.</div></div><hr />

I'm not a WoW math genius but wouldn't a weaker Obliterate (leaving Frost damage attacks like Frost Strike and Howling Blast as is) make Mastery again a more preferable stat than Haste and the use of Frost Presence more preferable than the use of Unholy Presence? I have a feeling Blizzard doesn't like the fact that the most optimal PvE damage for all DK damaging specs is achieved by stacking haste and using Unholy Presence.</div></div><hr />

Howling Blast would have been the way to go, not messing with the PVE part of the specc. Go play the game... idiots...<br />

and yeah I tried these classes and found it very easy to get high dps with shit gear. Maybe i am not the beast mage , but it also seems to me that all these stateofdps top mages got buffed with every last caster buff thats available, i guess every other class would do better with troll haste/disc haste/ele shami/lock haste/crit buff from arcane.</div></div><hr />

And how much strength do kats stack at the moment?<br />
<br />
As far as I'm aware, they only have base strength and then stack agility. Or is there some leather gear with strength on that I've missed?<br />
<br />
Thus, the nerf would mean approximately a 200-400 AP reduction.<br />
<br />
Hardly the cause for buffing their abilities so excessively. (Mind you, I'm not saying they don't need a buff.)<br />
<br />
Because from what I've seen, kats are pretty much terrible at DPS, these days. In fact, it's been months since I even saw a feral kat, be it raiding or in random heroics. And according to www.stateofdps.com, they're pretty much ranging from bringing up the rear, to somewhere mid-ish. However, I'm not sure how big a buff this is for them, as their %-of-weapon damage is such a high number.<br />
<br />
But some kind of buff, at least. Let's just hope it's spot on, rather than completely overpowered.</div></div><hr />

/sarcasm<br />
<br />
If raids where stacking shamans for mana tide, they should have figured out a different way to prevent this. Something like a heroism-like debuff maybe?<br />
<br />
This is total BS.<br />
<br />
They nerfed Water Shield regen as well, which is even more BS. They lowered the internal CD, yeah, but they also lowered the amount of mana gained. The net result WOULD be the same, if it wasn't for the fact that improved water shield procs off of crits. With this new water shield you have to have a crit heal every 3.5 seconds to get the same amount of regen as before. You'd need somewhere in the area of 60% crit for this.<br />
<br />
I guess I'll be rerolling in 4.2 if these changes end up going live, because it will be completely impossible to heal properly on my shaman.</div></div><hr />

Purge was already nerfed this expansion.

tbh every pally spec is viable atm<br />
pally healers are great in raids<br />
pally tanks are great<br />

back in tbc the only reason you would ever take a ret pally was if you neeeded some buffs otherwise they were useless. i think pallys just got very used to being buffed in wrath and are not used to it now the nerfs are incoming.</div></div><hr />

they're not getting nerfed more then other classes lol<br />

Tell me where is says that the &quot;shield&quot; scales with the &quot;crit&quot;<br />
<br />
Your direct healing spells also place an absorb shield on your target for 12% of the amount healed lasting 15 sec. Each point of Mastery increases the absorb amount by an additional 1.50%.<br />
<br />
so crits don't count as healing done?<br />
crits STILL make the shield, so bigger heals = bigger shields</div></div><hr />

The mana nerfs are really needed for 4.2. With Heroic 372 Gear Mana is already starting to become pretty easy to manage. Mana Tide Totem was freaking overpowered on a proper geared Shaman. So with 4.2 and all people getting 378 loot and better without nerfing mana costs and regen it would become just like ICC where mana isn't a factor at all. But Bilzzard wants mana to matter for healers.<br />
<br />
And 100% heal crits is pretty huge. This will more than compensate for the mana nerfs.</div></div><hr />

I mean, it was kinda a joke to allow to cap Conquests by loling 30-60 min in arena @ 100 rating.<br />
<br />
You can raid for the Valor cap. Arenas and rated BGs have been accepted to be the PvP equivalent of raids, therefore this change doesn't make sense like that.<br />
To be fair, it was a little too easy to get capped on Conquests though, and I think the change is good, as it'll lead to more good players in BGs, and more players overall in BGs. Net gain: shorter BG queues and more successful BGs. Yay!<br />

Oh and I'd like to point out that most healers (except Resto Shamans) have about 5-15% crit, which means that this 100% buff to crit heals will net them about a 2.5-7.5% bonus to healing. It's not as bad as you people seem to believe, and even if I got the math wrong, it's hardly a big buff - it just makes crits even across the board, and makes crit a more valuable stat for healers.</div></div><hr />

The crit buff will more than make up for the tiny mana increase. <br />
<br />
Also this in turn buffs our mastery (no idea why no one has mentioned this) as we will be landing stupidly massive heals with divine light and then leaving a shield which is going to be big too lol<br />

<br />
As far as I'm aware, they only have base strength and then stack agility. Or is there some leather gear with strength on that I've missed?<br />
<br />
Thus, the nerf would mean approximately a 200-400 AP reduction.<br />
<br />
Hardly the cause for buffing their abilities so excessively. (Mind you, I'm not saying they don't need a buff.)<br />
<br />
Because from what I've seen, kats are pretty much terrible at DPS, these days. In fact, it's been months since I even saw a feral kat, be it raiding or in random heroics. And according to www.stateofdps.com, they're pretty much ranging from bringing up the rear, to somewhere mid-ish. However, I'm not sure how big a buff this is for them, as their %-of-weapon damage is such a high number.<br />
<br />
But some kind of buff, at least. Let's just hope it's spot on, rather than completely overpowered.<br />
<br />
I don't know, but our cat is usually and consistently over 25k dps in every 10 man raid we do and on any boss this far, which is usually number 1 dps or he exchanges 1st/2nd with a hunter. Aside of that, we don't even CC raid trash anymore since he does 80k+ AOE shit on them, healers just spam heal him and everything goes down in few seconds.</div></div><hr />

This goes for raid-wide buffs like Mark of the Wild and Power Word: Fortitude, as well as triggered effects such as Blessed Resilience or Fingers of Frost, and single-target buffs like Dark Intent and Hysteria. The exception is buffs which directly cause healing or damage, such as Thorns or Renew. Abilities such as these still generate normal threat.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ahh... to bad for this change! I use it all the time on my Warrior for doing group line of site pulls. Get 1 CC going to aggro the group, pop Commanding or Battle Shout, then run behind a wall... all the rest come to me no fuss no muss. From the description Battle Shout aggro is gone for sure, but I don't think Commanding will work as it's not actually &quot;Healing&quot; anyone it is only increasing maximum health.<br />
<br />
Though I guess with the 4.2 change of CC no longer causing threat for the other mobs in the group, this change won't have as much impact anyways.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For a class relying on hots, it won't be unreliable at all, or very random for that matter. The crit change will translate into pure throughput for hots, since each tick of a hot is unlikely to overheal. The change will push all healing classes into more reliance on hots and similar spells (like CoH for priest) at the expense of single target heals (which will overheal more).</div></div><hr />

Never they'll think &quot;i am not playing my class really well&quot;.<br />
<br />
Well generalization, he's consistent at around 20-25k pretty much tho. We had another feral dps (semi-geared) join some raids (alt) and he was also pulling numbers that mages, spriests, warlocks can only look at and never achieve. Hunters/Druids are kings of DPS on our raids also Warriors are doing pretty nice damage tho. This is as said 10 men raid scenario, no clue how it is on 25 tho. <br />
<br />
As for state of dps, it's an avg from x players. I've yet to see one arcane mage pull 24k consistent dps as state of dps proclaims on the other hand same goes for warlocks. <br />
<br />
But that's my experience, I'm not calling for a nerf or anything tho, I'm just saying in general feral dps is fine. I guess it depends from player to player but the difference in very good and semi good player isn't that big when you're looking at ferals, or I've yet to see a real bad feral guy play.</div></div><hr />

Spellsteal nerf? FFFFFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU<br />
<br />
I mean really. Anyone spamming spellsteal is nerfing themselves by not casting any offensive spells in its place. Do we really need a handicap on that too?<br />
<br />
The handicap being you get to cast more offensive spells? Aka doing more damage (in most cases) and letting other classes help with purge, dispel etc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
lol what, a 10%( and its not even 10% its a 16th of the damage it does reduced) damage decrease on OB isnt going to make it a dead spec, with the rune changes it became very powerful indeed, you can use alot more OB than you used to it does not make sense to not nerf its damage a tiny bit.<br />
incase you have not noticed frost is blowing unholy out of the water atm in pve and pvp, unholy has become a dead spec for any serious DK<br />
this change is to bring them both to an acceptable level, and tbh i still think frost will be more powerful than unholy.</div></div><hr />

you certainly know maths. i fail to see how 19%=10%. also frost is in a good and balanced position now without the nerf so this is certainly overkill, like they did with unholy. Unholy buff is needed but frost nerf is going overboard, it should be closer to 5% if at all</div></div><hr />
