Blizzard Battle.net - Stay connected with your friends wherever you are<br />
<br />
The Blizzard Battle.net Mobile App lets you stay connected with your friends wherever you are. Chat with friends, see what game they're playing, and add new ones - right from your mobile device.<br />

<br />
See what your friends are playing:<br />
You can see at a glance what all your friends are up to, so you know when to jump into a game – or when to get one going yourself. Never miss an opportunity to play together.<br />
<br />
Add new friends on the go:<br />
All the features for managing and adding friends on the Battle.net Desktop App are now on your phone. Send and receive friend requests, browse friend suggestions, or even scan a QR code to easily add friends in person.<br />

Weekly Bonus Event - Battlegrounds<br />
A new weekly quest and rewards are here—steel yourself for Battleground combat!<br />
<br />
Seven Days on the Battlegrounds<br />
All this week, heading to the Battlegrounds will net you some extra Honor along with bonus loot for completing this week’s quest. To enter the fray, open Group Finder (default hotkey: I) and then select the Player vs. Player tab. Next choose Casual, select Random Battlegrounds, and hit the Join Battle button—you’ll be matched up with other players and sent to one of the 11 battlegrounds.<br />

Weekly Quest<br />
Before you get started, Archmage Timear (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/111246-archmage-timear) near Violet Hold in Dalaran has a quest for you (http://www.wowdb.com/quests/44173-a-call-to-battle).

<br />
A New Event Every Week<br />

A) Apple has an approval process that takes time, they're not neglecting, its just not approved yet<br />
<br />
B) Android holds over 60% of the market share of mobile and tablet OSs, so makes sense to release it there as soon as it was ready.<br />

I realize that's not related to the news post, I'm just salty about it.<br />

<br />
If they can make that optional maybe.<br />
<br />
Hearthstone is a massive game for mobile. Would prefer not to use up the space.<br />
<br />
Hell, just make the battle net messenger app a downloader for any other app and allow the apps to interact. Easiest way to do it imo.</div></div><hr />

Are you EU? They somehow missed the part where these hotfixes took a realm restart to take affect.</div></div><hr />

Apple taking their own sweet time indexing it for search purposes.<br />

From what I'm hearing from Blizzard employees , Blizzard actually published this hours ago. <br />

They need to combine Legion Companion App, WoW Armory app, and the Battle.net app into one. I get some people like only have the App they want to use but I wish I could use the features of all of them in one app.<br />

<br />
I remembered we all asked for armory to add PM since day 1 but they insist to put only guild chat; now suddenly we got it... in another app.<br />
Edit: installed the app and apparently it is not working.<br />
<br />

<br />
Account-wide access to World Quests and treasures in Antoran Wastes is now allowed once &quot;The Assault Begins&quot; chapter of the Argus campaign has been completed.<br />
Account-wide access to Invasion Points and Greater Invasion Points is now allowed once the &quot;Dark Awakenings&quot; chapter of the Argus campaign has been completed.<br />
<br />
Might as well make the Krokul Flute available to alts as well. But I guess it doesnt matter, since they actually want us to grind all alts to exalted for the Permanent Augment Rune.</div></div><hr />

On the other hand it's still a pointless change as you need to do the questchain to unlock the MacAree WQs which aren't unlocked accountwide.

<br />
Simple. They are announcing a new mobile game at Blizzcon this year, which will be the first to come to that new &quot;mobile battle net app&quot;. From now on, this new app is their main app moving forward. Making their other apps compatible (or include them) is either not worth their time or they are working on it.</div></div><hr />

Because you need an internet connection for it to be able to send and receive data like any other app, I Imagine? Airtime being your phone's own internet.</div></div><hr />
