is Ironbound Wraithcharger a WoD exclusive? or will it be obtainable a long while from now? should i be rushing to get asap?<br />

Game Design<br />
could either of you clarify the difference between creative and technical design from your perspectives?<br />
Good question. I can't fit a good answer in a twitter post, so I wrote a quick blog on it: https://t.co/sao6zGnWPk (craig_amai (https://twitter.com/craig_amai/status/640291522651418624))<br />

Ghostcrawler Tweets<br />
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br />
but why did so many feel the need to server transfer? Cause playerbase dropped with cata overtuning. Servers healthy in wotlk<br />
Not my recollection. In NA, PvP players move to Tich and raiders to Mal'ganis. That's where the action was. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/641245470656847872))<br />
In my memory, my server still had an identity (i.e. I knew individual players) in BC but not beyond. YMMV. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/641245670276403201))<br />
<br />
Were you consulted on things that had a dollar or pound/euro value behind them like server transfers, you know what I mean.<br />
Yes. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/641245017919504384))<br />

Road to BlizzCon – Watch the Americas Regionals Live September 12–13<br />
Eight teams have qualified for the 2015 World of Warcraft Arena Americas Regionals tournament—one from Latin America, one from Australia and New Zealand, and six from North America. On September 12 and 13, three of those teams will advance to the WoW Arena World Championship at BlizzCon 2015 . . . and five will be heading back home.<br />
<br />
You’ll be able to watch the carnage unfold live on Twitch.tv/Warcraft on September 12 and 13 at 12 p.m. PT—but in the meantime, let’s meet the contenders who’ve risen through the ranks over the past few months.<br />
<br />
The Teams<br />
<br />
Method<br />
Under their original moniker &quot;Is Butter a Carb,&quot; this was the first North American team to qualify, beating out Luminosity in the Grand Finals of the first North American Online Qualifier Cup back in July. Since then, the group has reunited under the Method banner to prove that their run in Cup 1 was no coincidence and that they deserve a spot in the World Championships at BlizzCon.<br />
<br />
Team Captain: Chanimal – Affliction/Demonology Warlock<br />
Gorecki – Restoration Shaman, Balance Druid, Beast Mastery Hunter, Affliction Warlock<br />
Rositajonez – Frost Mage<br />
Psytrix – Holy Paladin<br />
<br />
<br />
Juveniles<br />
This team claimed victory under the name &quot;Rise of le Sock&quot; in the second North American Online Qualifier Cup, and eliminated many well-known players to get here. As the only team in the Regionals with only three players on their roster—and only one playable composition—they must prove that numbers don’t make might if they want to advance to BlizzCon.<br />
<br />
Team Captain: Roastyz – Subtlety Rogue<br />
Wealthysockx – Frost Mage<br />
Kubzy – Restoration Druid<br />
<br />
<br />
Tempo Storm<br />
The name Tempo Storm has inspired fear in opponents in many eSports events, and the World of Warcraft Arena is no different. Tempo Storm has proven time and again that they’re a force to be reckoned with in online tournaments, but can they hold up under pressure at the Americas Regionals?<br />
<br />
Team Captain: Elite – Holy Paladin<br />
Pikaboo – Subtlety Rogue, Arms Warrior<br />
Jahmilli – Frost Mage, Subtlety/Combat Rogue, Shadow Priest, Enhancement Shaman<br />
Starship – Restoration Druid, Survival/Beast Mastery Hunter<br />
<br />
<br />
Luminosity<br />
Luminosity had a very competitive showing in NA Online Qualifier Cups 1 and 2, but it wasn’t until Cup 3 that they secured their position at Regionals. Now they’re out to prove that those defeats were merely a setback and that they’re destined for the Arena stage at BlizzCon.<br />
<br />
Team Captain: Vanguards – Enhancement Shaman, Retribution Paladin, Mistweaver Monk<br />
Maldiva – Affliction Warlock<br />
Smexxin – Arms/Fury Warrior<br />
Dannycarry – Restoration Druid, Mistweaver Monk<br />
<br />
<br />
Dream Deferred<br />
In the third NA Online Qualifier Cup, this team (previously named &quot;World of Warcats&quot;) showed just how much of a threat they can be right out of the gates, scoring two wins in under 60 seconds. Are the other teams prepared for Dream Deferred’s opening onslaught?<br />
<br />
Team Captain: Blackjeff – Frost/Unholy Death Knight<br />
Beatsbydrake – Affliction/Demonology Warlock<br />
Sychzy – Feral Druid<br />
Vincentwong – Holy Paladin<br />
<br />
<br />
FolloweSports.com<br />
Formerly known as &quot;Carlos’ Bandidos&quot;, this team fought to the bitter end to secure their spot, beating out Dream Team 3–2 in the third-place match at NA Online Cup 3. They’re going to need to keep that same determination and tenacity to fight through the other teams in the Americas Regionals.<br />
<br />
Team Captain: Absterge – Restoration Shaman<br />
Jellybeans – Beast Mastery Hunter<br />
Vosil – Affliction/Demonology Warlock<br />
Walterbare – Feral Druid<br />
<br />
<br />
Hype<br />
Hype (previously &quot;Bang Bang AU&quot;) emerged victorious as the winners of the Australia &amp; New Zealand qualifying tournament in July. Although these players are relatively unknown, they had an extremely solid showing in the qualifiers. How will they stack up against the best teams from the Americas?<br />
<br />
Team Captain: Nyz – Unholy Death Knight<br />
Oyx – Arms Warrior<br />
Ymcmshred – Restoration Druid<br />
Creepinbrah – Restoration Druid<br />
<br />
<br />
Santos Dexterity<br />
Santos Dexterity, originally known as &quot;This is Brasil&quot;, dominated the Copa America, winning four out of five play days and not dropping a single game in the finals stage. Consistency was the name of their game, as they won every single game with their preferred composition of Enhancement Shaman, Affliction Warlock, and Restoration Druid.<br />
<br />
Team Captain: Rynd – Restoration Druid, Restoration Shaman, Holy Paladin<br />
Shapis – Affliction Warlock<br />
Murmindz – Enhancement Shaman, Shadow Priest<br />
Xadin – Arms Warrior<br />
<br />
<br />
The Prizes<br />
The teams at the Americas Regionals will be competing for their share of a massive $100,000 prize pool—the largest of any regional event in World of Warcraft history. Every team will receive a portion of that money, but the amount increases dramatically the further the teams advance through the tournament.<br />
<br />
1st place team: $50,000<br />
2nd place team: $20,000<br />
3rd place team: $10,000<br />
4th place team: $8,000<br />
5th–6th place teams: $4,000<br />
7th–8th place teams: $2,000<br />
<br />
<br />
Of course, that’s not the only prize at stake. The top three teams will also advance to the WoW Arena World Championship at BlizzCon 2015, where they’ll join five more teams from around the world to compete for $250,000 in prize money.<br />
<br />
The Event<br />
The World of Warcraft Arena Americas Regionals will be broadcast live on Twitch.tv/Warcraft starting at 12 p.m. PT on Saturday, September 12 and Sunday, September 13. You won’t want to miss a second of the action.<br />
<br />
Of course, an epic event needs an epic crew, and we’re pulling out all the stops with a collection of some of the best shoutcasters and analysts in the World of Warcraft Arena scene:<br />
<br />
Sid ’Supatease’ Compston<br />
Elliott ‘Venruki’ Venczel<br />
Jared ‘vhell’ Coulston<br />
Josh ‘Lore’ Allen<br />
Jackson ‘Bajheera’ Bliton<br />
<br />
<br />
These guys will be talking spectators through every match, ensuring that you don’t miss any of the high-level strategic play we know we can expect from these amazing teams. We’ll see you there!<br />

3D Printed Weapon - Blackhand's Hammer<br />
Ceravyn shared (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:997957) a 3D Printer Blackhand's Hammer, similar to The Black Hand (http://www.wowdb.com/items/113979-the-black-hand)'s model. <br />

Hey, gratz on the impressive feat with the kill. I have no idea what you're trying to say though. Having opaque anime shit covering 1/8 of the screen is just retarded.</div></div><hr />

Anime stuff in the corner is for % resolve, he uses the image to get the &lt;1 second response directly instead of reading the numbers. <br />
Since resolve changes so quickly I can understand the need for it. Especially as a BM tank where a high resolve based guard is the difference between being indestructible and being a burnt paper bag. <br />
<br />
<br />
I prefer a very clean UI while I'm tanking but I can understand why he'd prefer a giant image for a fight like this. not much going on visually, he just needs a precise timing for his guards/cooldowns.</div></div><hr />

I'm not big into anime but if the UI suits you it suits you, and if you like anime that's cool too. People need to grow up. At least you're passionate about something.</div></div><hr />

Or you know, it could be solid criticism.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Solid would imply that you have a basis for objectivity. Criticism of someone's personal tastes when it neither harms or affects others is completely and absolutely baseless. Even saying that the UI is distracting is kind of pointless considering that this is someone's personalized UI and obviously they are okay with it.<br />
<br />
Don't be rude. :)</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">guardian_titan</div><div class="date">2015-09-12, 04:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Solid (or constructive) criticism is meant to help something get better. You make some chocolate chip cookies and someone suggests to to use a different brand of butter or chocolate chips or to even add some peanut butter chips or drop/raise the cooking temperature is constructive. Telling the person they used a crappy baking sheet that didn't relate at all to the taste of the cookies isn't constructive.<br />
<br />
Everyone plays with their own UI. What works for one person won't work for another. You go into someone's house and compare it to your own. Will they be identical? No. Even if you go into a cookie cutter built house, it won't be identical to the one next to it with furniture alone. Just because something doesn't work for you doesn't mean it doesn't work for others. Not everything has to appeal to you. Not everything should appeal to you. Some players play fine with the default UI. Others can play with minimal (or even no) UI. Others have to have a cluttered one. I like chocolate ice cream. Doesn't mean those who like vanilla are wrong. We just have different tastes.<br />
<br />
The point of the video was to show a solo kill of Ko'ragh (which was quite impressive), not the UI. If you can't get beyond the UI, you have other issues. Learn to look at what's being presented and not focus on things that ultimately don't matter. If you can't look beyond the surface of the video, then I suspect you also judge people based upon something arbitrary like their clothes rather than upon their actions. Don't judge a book by its cover. You have to open the book to read the story.</div></div><hr />

When you're making, in our example, a video that is supposed to appeal to the masses, you need to go to the common denominator.<br />
Whether you think it's justified or not, it seems that quite a few people have issues with how it's presented. You can't expect people not commenting on such a bold thing, and it completely derails the video to &quot;anime sucks/rocks&quot;. It completely misses the intention to show a world first kill.<br />
If the author wants to present his taste in anime above making the video more &quot;mass-friendly&quot;, then he should expect these comments.</div></div><hr />

It's not an anime (that makes me laugh to read it's an anime everywhere :D).<br />

This is fanart based on the character of Flandre Scarlet from the video game Touhou6 (The Embodiment of Scarlet Devil - extra boss).<br />

Mad respect for the solo but your UI makes me want to punch kittens. However, I do realize that if it works for you then it is doing the job. BUT when you produce a video to show the world you may consider a more standard UI.</div></div><hr />

Never have I said his UI shouldn't suit his needs, but if he wants his video to appeal to the masses, then using something less obvious is the better choice, which would easily be possible using video editing. De facto it deterred quite a bit of people, pointing it out is criticism.<br />
<br />
No need to get aggressive about it, I'm just trying to make a solid discussion. calling out people being &quot;insecure&quot; sure as hell doesn't make your opinion stronger.</div></div><hr />

Criticism of someone's personal tastes when it neither harms or affects others is completely and absolutely baseless. Even saying that the UI is distracting is kind of pointless considering that this is someone's personalized UI and obviously they are okay with it.<br />
<br />
Don't be rude. :)<br />
<br />
When their choices are put on display, that's all the excuse or rationalization for having an opinion. Your comments are just as rude as the ones you're accusing.</div></div><hr />

It's a shame some players don't prioritise good looks in the UI though. It is possible to be functional AND presentable. I'm a bit of a neat freak on my UI so everything is themed, matching, and tidy. This is just... all over the place. Why even bother having all that scrolling text when it's going too fast, and far too frequently to be able to read anyway, whilst also focusing on the fight?<br />

I've seen many ugly UIs in my time, and yep, this one takes the cake :P</div></div><hr />

Probably cause it's not enjoyable to watch due to the UI taking up 95% of screen real estate and shit overlapping all over the place.<br />
<br />

I'm sure you'll reply with something like don't watch it then, well he made it public viewing so you gotta expect criticism.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because it is changing from picture to picture frequently. I understand the purpose of it (indicating resolve amount) but it's just such an ugly addition to the already exploded interface. I'm sure it helps him as he is used to it but another player looking at that interface could find a million things that could be put in better places. Personally, I hate having all the extra symbols in the middle of the screen as I feel like it obstructs the field of view needlessly. But I have to agree with others that have posted, of all parts of the interface that resolve signal thing is just disgusting. But really, i've seen a lot of interesting interfaces in boss kill videos but that resolve meter is probably the single worst addon i've ever seen. There has to be something far more visually appealing and less cumbersome that has been developed for resolve.</div></div><hr />

Not really. It's in the center of the screen because that's where your vision is best.<br />
It looks like two of those show the ICD of trinkets (useful to know).<br />
Pretty much everything on there I can see a reason for.<br />
You'll notice the -huge- open bottom left area. There's a reason for that.<br />
<br />
More likely than your theory is: You don't try to solo bosses. Knowing that much information to *you* isn't needed and is not likely to be the make/break for downing a boss.<br />
<br />
So you prefer to spend your time cleaning up your interface -- this person prefers to solo bosses and down them. You two simply have different interests.</div></div><hr />

For a video that's being made public to showcase a 'feat' being accomplished, especially one that's now being promoted on one of (if not the largest) fan site for the game, the video could look presentable. Right now there's so much everything everywhere on the screen that 10 seconds in I nearly forgot what it was I was trying to watch.<br />

<br />
The UI is so god awful and bloated combined with buttons that are nearly as large as the boss, that I immediately lost focus of anything that was trying to be shown in the video. I've seen two year olds draw pictures that look better than that bucket of pig slop someone threw on a monk's FoV. Perhaps next time you make a video you can <br />
<br />
I don't &quot;feel entitled to a &quot;better&quot; ui&quot;. I feel like the point of the video is lost because that UI is so god awful that 10 seconds in you're trying to figure out what it was you were trying to watch in the first place. Was there even a boss in that video? <br />
