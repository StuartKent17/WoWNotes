Additional PvE and PvP content in a future patch<br />
Zarhym posted a very interesting comments about what's coming after Icecrown Citadel. Apparently, Blizzard plans to release a few more things before the big 4.0 patch and the expansion and we might see a few more additions to the game. Don't get your hopes too high, Zarhym also confirmed that Icecrown Citadel would be the last big raid of the expansion. <br />
With that being said, we do have some additional PvE and PvP content and changes we plan to implement prior to the release of the big Cataclysm patch and subsequent retail release of that third expansion. We'll be discussing these new features in more detail in the coming weeks. <br />
<br />
[...] As we stated before releasing Wrath of the Lich King, we still intend for Icecrown Citadel to be the final raid of the expansion in terms of tiered progression. <br />

Can't play without healing debuffs in PvP<br />
I agree it's an issue and we do have some plans. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/23140304646-question-about-cata-re-healing-debuffs.html))<br />
<br />
Bryntroll and other proc weapons<br />
I wouldn't worry so much about how much percentage of your damage the proc is doing. I mentioned that once when comparing various proc weapons and it became adopted as the design goal for all proc weapons. It isn't.<br />
<br />
The only real salient comparison is Bryntroll to other two handed dps weapons of the same ilevel (or Zod's to other bows or Trauma to other healing weapons, etc.) Procs are always going to be more random than pure stats, and we can live with that. If you're very intolerant of RNG mechanics, then proc weapons probably aren't for you. If swapping from Bryntroll to another item on the same tier of content is a significant dps increase (taking class, spec and other gear considerations in mind of course), then there is a problem with the weapon. It's as simple as that. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/23140304204-another-bryntroll-qq-thread-gc-please-read.html))<br />
<br />
Game balance in Cataclysm<br />
However, we're going to back off of talking about Cataclysm for a little bit. We're excited about it, so we've been wanting to share our philosophy, plans and ideas as they relate to class design. However, it may be a little too soon. I think it's clear that some players are mistaking our excitement for Cataclysm as our giving up on Lich King. (&quot;Cataclysm will fix it.&quot;) That's not our intent nor plan, but I can understand how you might draw that conclusion. We'll talk more about the upcoming expansion soon (tm).

<br />
40-players raids<br />
Right now our plan is to look back on 40-player raids fondly as a format by which we were able to evolve and customize what we feel to be the best raid formats for World of Warcraft. I don't believe our developers have ever stated that they'll absolutely never do a 40-player raid again, but we're really happy with the raid variety we have now with 10- and 25-player raids featuring normal and Heroic difficulties.<br />
<br />
The game did rapidly expand from 2004-2006, but I'm not sure it's safe to assume that such a growth in the size of the player base related specifically to what was happening at the endgame. In fact, it had much more to do with the game's overall accessibility, engaging quest experiences, interesting lore, and strong game play mechanics. It was such a growth that ultimately encouraged our desire to make the raiding game more accessible to the new types of people we were introducing to the MMORPG genre.<br />
<br />
So while we haven't rapidly expanded our player base over the last year, we've retained our record subscription numbers after five years since World of Warcraft's release. We feel this in part due to the updates we've made to the endgame. We see a greater percentage of players raiding now than ever before, and not just one or two of the easier raid dungeons as in the original game and first expansion. We're seeing much more casual-oriented players serious about fighting the Lich King, while also seeing some of the most advanced guilds in the world begin to work out the strategies for besting him on Heroic difficulty. Our next step is to go back to the early game in Cataclysm and provide additional updates and improvements to bring it closer in line with our development experience, today's technology, and the type of gamers we want to attract. This is in addition to encouraging existing players to try the game again, but have it feel much more like a new experience.<br />
<br />
As a long story short, we'll continue to iterate upon the raiding game to improve it, but we feel we have a working formula right now. In order to appeal to a wider range of players, sheer numbers and time devoted should not be the primary determining factors of success in this game.

<br />
Is Icecrown Citadel too easy compared to old raids?<br />
Let's keep things in perspective here. There is a very small percentage of players who have defeated every raid boss in this game consistently for five years straight now. That kind of experience is unparalleled. There's also a very thick system of online resources for providing and sharing strategies which were not nearly as robust for the original game as they are today. The community that's grown around this game has somewhat changed the way the game is played. That's okay though. That's natural.<br />
<br />
The fact that at least 25 members of our player base have killed Sindragosa on Heroic difficulty doesn't say much about whether or not the encounter is more complicated than, say, Twin Emperors. In fact, most of the raiders I've talked to who are at, or have killed the Lich King in 25-player mode say that Icecrown Citadel has provided some of the most fun and interesting mechanics this game has yet to offer. Most of the fights today are technically more complex than the fights of old, but the difference is in the tuning and the polish.<br />
<br />
I can think of at least a couple of bosses that took a long time for any guild to kill where bugs were a major factor. As soon as the bugs were fixed, the bosses were defeated. There were also several bosses, take Princess Huhuran for example, which weren't necessarily incredibly challenging from a mechanic perspective. The challenge came in the form of requiring that players farm resistance gear from that same instance for weeks and weeks until they stood a chance. Resistance fights have since more or less disappeared. We want the interesting mechanics of a fight and the fun factor of that fight to be what players remember, not that they had to wait for major bugs to get fixed, or farm enough of a specific type of stat to even stand a chance. Of course there are gear checks still in the game, but they're much more reasonable. They allow you to customize your character to your wishes and prove your talent by successfully performing your class/spec role, while also successfully learning and reacting to the mechanics of each fight. These are areas in which guilds like the one to which you're referring excel to an impressive degree.

Why do I feel a troll raid! After all, troll raids are not &quot;tiered&quot; progression? :D<br />
Maybe something like ZA, only 10man with difficulty level slightly harder than ICC 10 yet still easier than ICC 25?<br />

Dont tell me you didnt either?<br />
Considering the HUGE troll area in Northrend, I think its safe to say if there was another raid released it would be troll oriented.<br />

Still, I wouldn't mind a couple of 5 or 10 mans that open up like the ICC5 areas, heroic-only, which deal with some intermittant 'mopping up' of some stronger minions of Arthas who decided the crown-switch was a good moment to set up shop for themselves somewhere. Possibly not even all of them in Northrend.<br />

ZA is my favourite raid of all time:<br />
- 10 man only (It is more fun to raid with a small group than a big bunch of people)<br />
- Not too big (Doesn't take a whole evening or more to clear)<br />
- Fast-paced (The time run actually forces people to pay attention and move their asses)<br />
- Nice scenery (not as depressing as Karazhan or Naxx)<br />
- Trolls, mon!</div></div><hr />

But now they are saying they miss em or w/e i misread somewhere in this thread the point im getting to is this. At this stage in the game when everyone pretty much knows their class would it really be so bad to release a 40 man raid. I mean just think about how epic the battle would be if you actually had 40 people trying their hardest to kill a boss. <br />
<br />
I mean sure back in vanilla you had slackers, you had people that didnt know their class, didnt do w/e it took to do their best. Now look to today you have people gemming/patching/glyphing for as much dps as they can push, now imagine 40 people doing that and how hard it would be to do a boss like that.<br />
<br />
Sure some if not most guilds nowadays dont have 40 people who can completely be on time every night for a boss/raid thats how come this is a MMO you can ally yourselves with other guilds ive seen it hell ive done it to complete bosses in BC and wotlk you can pull a select group from your friends guild, to help you out and complete a boss.<br />
<br />
Me personally i think it would be nice to see at least 1 if not 2 bosses in cata that would be 40 man capable sure not all but a few would be nice it would return the epicness to the game. Call me a vanilla loving asshat who lives in nastalgia if you want to but in the long run, were the raids in vanilla really so bad?</div></div><hr />

Although I personally haven't killed Arthas yet I have to say that when it comes to raiding difficulty in this expansion I'm hugely disappointed in Blizzard. I understand that they want as many as possible to see their content and that's agreeable but well isn't normal modes there to do that? <br />
And hardmodes was supposed to be hard, or what? It wont be hardmode if they simply slap some extra dmg done from the boss and a larger HP pool.. Added twists and mechanics is needed, which requires us to alter tactic either partly or completely. I'm not a big fan of limited attempts either, to me that only seems like a way to create half-assed content and force it to last longer than it otherwise would've because of the level of difficulty the bosses are on.<br />
<br />
Vodka neither Paragon had &quot;access&quot; to boss kill videos and they sure as hell aint sharing in between, strategics n such for the ICC Hardmodes and I think it's an utter joke, completely BS that 11/12 HM's are down in 25man.. WTH I have to say to that.. Now I'm sure it's going to take a few resets for my guild to clear everything on HM.. But man.. this is silly... So much for giving the hardcores something hard to compete with each other over when it comes to ranking..<br />
<br />
I don't think Blizzard ever is going to openly admit to creating Hardmodes that wasn't hard enough (some of their developers do, as private opinion ofc... yes I know a couple of Blizz employees that actually do important stuff).. Because I tell you all the top raiders I've spoken to are annoyed with how easy stuff is... The boss fights themselves can be nice and fun, we've seen a lot of new stuff in this exp (and that's a good thing) but it's simply under tuned in HM... It makes me almost rip my hair off =| and I got pretty long brown hair!<br />

You haven't even killed Sindragosa Normal and your are complaining about dificulty? <br />
If you remember the race for the so called &quot;hardest&quot; bosses in WoW (talking about naxx 60 and swp), you would remember that Paragon/Vodka like guilds killed them really soon after release, most of them on the same day (taking the artifical blocks in consideration like Sunwell gating system, T3 gear check for the tanks on Four Horseman for no tount resist etc etc)<br />
The encounter that lasted the most is Alone in the Darkness, although there were artificial blocks there as well.</div></div><hr />

Drop gear on levels equal to the ICC 5s, but in a raid environment, and maybe have the final boss or two drop frost emblems.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Gundrak's a pretty big place. Definitely room for a raid there. I'd be disappointed if they didn't use it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Plus! The snake in Dungeon!Gundrak! We need to find out where it goes to! What it belongs to! :O <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, sort of related to 40 mans: Personally, I think 10s are too small and 25s too big; I think it was a good experiment, but after three different trials of implementations ( 10 and 25, 10/25 with Activated Hardmodes, and 10/25 with 'Heroic Mode' ) - I like &quot;hard mode vs. normal&quot; (especially if Hard has more mechanics), but I'd love to just settle on 15-mans or 20-mans; but none of this 25s. Heck, maybe even balance 20s around 20% tanks, 20&amp; healers, and 60% dps (3/3/9 or 4/4/12)? Then, too, endgame raid comp might perpetuate tank/healer vs. dps inequality, but it at least keeps a level of relative equality - you need enough tanks and healers for dps for 5-man work as you do for raids.<br />

I have absolutely NO desire to do 40 man raids. At all. Ever. Trying to get 25 people working together and scheduled together is like herding cats ALREADY. And more is just crazy. If the hardest encounters, or even all raiding, was 40-man only... well. I'm not going to rage quit, but it would certainly be a lot less fun. I can't possibly see the people who would like this being a bigger group than the people who dislike this or see it as insane. Sorry, 40!fans.</div></div><hr />

That combined with the fact that the topmost raid of a whole expansion will be pugable pretty soon is what makes people sad I guess.<br />
<br />
<br />
OH NO SOME FORM EXISTS where semicasuals can kill Arthas, the villain that for some reason most of the playerbase considers to be THE Villain of WoW! THIS IS HORRIBLE! Why do these people get sad? It's not likely that Heroic Arthas will be puggable any time soon, they still have probably a demanding challenge - and so if you have that, who cares if there's also easy mode? It doesn't magically diminish their accomplishments in heroic.</div></div><hr />

But now they are saying they miss em or w/e i misread somewhere in this thread the point im getting to is this. At this stage in the game when everyone pretty much knows their class would it really be so bad to release a 40 man raid. I mean just think about how epic the battle would be if you actually had 40 people trying their hardest to kill a boss. <br />
<br />
I mean sure back in vanilla you had slackers, you had people that didnt know their class, didnt do w/e it took to do their best. Now look to today you have people gemming/patching/glyphing for as much dps as they can push, now imagine 40 people doing that and how hard it would be to do a boss like that.<br />
<br />
Sure some if not most guilds nowadays dont have 40 people who can completely be on time every night for a boss/raid thats how come this is a MMO you can ally yourselves with other guilds ive seen it hell ive done it to complete bosses in BC and wotlk you can pull a select group from your friends guild, to help you out and complete a boss.<br />
<br />
Me personally i think it would be nice to see at least 1 if not 2 bosses in cata that would be 40 man capable sure not all but a few would be nice it would return the epicness to the game. Call me a vanilla loving asshat who lives in nastalgia if you want to but in the long run, were the raids in vanilla really so bad?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Just no....the vast majority of guilds and servers are now set up for 10/25 man raids, which will continue into cata. The organisation needed for a 40man boss (10healers, 5 tanks etc etc) would tear guilds apart, unless it was the eqivalent of a VoA boss which could be easily, easily pugged, and in which case, it would be content which would take an hour each week and wouldn't keep people interested until what seems like Oct/Nov.<br />
<br />
We're a pretty casual, 10man guild (and which do 25mans with another + a few pugs), clearing both the lower spire and plaguelands with ease in 10man. we've also done blood council, and close on blood queen. So, on normal 10man mode, we've got 4 bosses left....<br />
<br />
Blizz are going to have a serious issue around april/May time where most people in even casual guilds will start to kill Arthas. At that point, a new carrot will seriously be needed, as the drive to do hardmodes won't be the same.</div></div><hr />

Thats what the ICC5mans and badges are for. If you think that a 10/25man the same gear level of ToC10/25 is going to go down well then I think you'll need to look again.<br />
<br />
Having nearly a year from ICC to Cata is not going to go down well. As I said, come April or May with nothing new and they'll have a serious problem.</div></div><hr />

<br />
well thats why i said ppl could combine guilds to help kill a said boss/raid not like disband to make a giant guild like in old days but everyone has friends in other guilds and you get asked to said raid from other people it wouldnt be that hard to do. <br />
<br />
I understand that the guild dynamic now is setup for 10/25 raid farming. Unless you played vanilla you really dont understand the coordination it took to get 40 people together, yes it was a pain, yes it was frustrating but after having pulled the 40 ppl together from other guilds/friends it was actually quit memorable. Hell i still remember my first MC and BWL clear, after all these years after all these bosses and after all the friends i made in BC and Wotlk nothing compares to the friendships/comradery you get from 39 other people in the guild/raid. <br />
<br />
like i said before call it nestalgia or w/e you want but i honestly miss the pure hecticness of said 40 raids, sure itll probably never happen again cept in my memorys but its fun to think about.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The result? Most of the raids will be semi-pugs, an extra 15 people to afk or slack or d/c. In a 40man raid you can hide a lot easier and depend on others doing your jobs for you. 25mans are tough enough to run and organise as is.</div></div><hr />

IoC and AV rarely pop on our battlegroup ratings would just make everything less likely to happen. All I do for PvP now is the weekly WG quests to get gold, shards and free 10-15k honour with no grinds.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Although I personally haven't killed Arthas yet I have to say that when it comes to raiding difficulty in this expansion I'm hugely disappointed in Blizzard. I understand that they want as many as possible to see their content and that's agreeable but well isn't normal modes there to do that? <br />
And hardmodes was supposed to be hard, or what? It wont be hardmode if they simply slap some extra dmg done from the boss and a larger HP pool.. Added twists and mechanics is needed, which requires us to alter tactic either partly or completely. I'm not a big fan of limited attempts either, to me that only seems like a way to create half-assed content and force it to last longer than it otherwise would've because of the level of difficulty the bosses are on.<br />
<br />
Vodka neither Paragon had &quot;access&quot; to boss kill videos and they sure as hell aint sharing in between, strategics n such for the ICC Hardmodes and I think it's an utter joke, completely BS that 11/12 HM's are down in 25man.. WTH I have to say to that.. Now I'm sure it's going to take a few resets for my guild to clear everything on HM.. But man.. this is silly... So much for giving the hardcores something hard to compete with each other over when it comes to ranking..<br />
<br />
I don't think Blizzard ever is going to openly admit to creating Hardmodes that wasn't hard enough (some of their developers do, as private opinion ofc... yes I know a couple of Blizz employees that actually do important stuff).. Because I tell you all the top raiders I've spoken to are annoyed with how easy stuff is... The boss fights themselves can be nice and fun, we've seen a lot of new stuff in this exp (and that's a good thing) but it's simply under tuned in HM... It makes me almost rip my hair off =| and I got pretty long brown hair!<br />
<br />
Well.. I guess AFK for 6-8 months before Cata.. ICC will probably be just as BT was.. *shrugs* an instance farmed for almost 1 year before something else came out to raid.<br />
<br />
<br />
To paraphrase a blue poster: Because people who are not you have downed lots of hardmode bosses, raiding is to easy?<br />
<br />
WTF. There is simply no (non-bugged) encounter Blizzard could make that the world top-10 guild won't beat within a week. Those are people playing together for ages, there are no slackers there like in regular raids, those people switch professions for specific encounters, etc.<br />
<br />
For &quot;normal&quot; guilds I imagine hardmodes are rather... hard. There aren't a lot of &quot;normal&quot; guilds who have downed the Lich King on normal mode either...</div></div><hr />

<br />
I reply by quoting myself: <br />
<br />
<br />
And stop posting the wowprogress.com stats about the kills or saying &quot;most people haven´t even killed Arthas normal yet&quot;. The limited tries save bosses from being killed and nothing else. My guild needed 23 tries for PP and 14 for BQL. Because of the limited tries thats four IDs/weeks instead of one.To put it in perspective: we needed 25 tries on Mimiron (normal) and 48 on Yogg-Saron+4. We cleared Ulduar in the 2nd ID (which is way to fast imo if a raid-instance has to last for 6 months). We will most likely clear ICC within 7-9 IDs, simply because of the try-limit and nothing else. Don´t compare that to something being difficult ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
The epic quests could give additional ranks of spells like they used to. Like a new conjure food rank, somehting that wouldn't imbalance PvE.<br />
<br />
There could be quests to get the keys to unlock different sections. <br />

There could be a random rare mob that spawns every 6 hours in a PvP type arena.<br />

It's not that fact that people were having 8%~ of their damage being bryntoll proc when it first came out because clearly other parts of their DPS went up by now, it's the actual proc numbers during fights going down. That has NOTHING to do with RNG when it's a significant change that's literally incomparable. <br />
<br />
Like originally on 5-6min ish fights I saw many ret paladins having that proc 80~ times when it fight came out, that was changed to basically half when they realized other debuff were proc-ing it, and recently that was basically halved again. I think that's peoples' issue with weapons like these, not ''the % of my damage from it went down.. Q_Q i dont know what rng is''</div></div><hr />

<br />
They're not. But it does take longer to fill a 25 man regularly if you are more discerning. Some folks don't have the patience for it. Took our guild almost 4 months back in the days of naxx to get a full all guild 25 man going. Haven't pugged a persons since, unless they were a prospective applicant to the guild.</div></div><hr />

If the (supposed) interim raid's rewards do not provide sufficient incentive to keep guilds farming it then it won't fulfil its sole purpose of keeping people playing until cataclysm. While I am sure we would all love it Blizzard could add a raid that was as much fun the 20th time you farmed it as it was the first realistically thats not going to happen. Farming is what keeps people occupied and if there is another raid between now and Cataclysm that will be its sole purpose.<br />
<br />
Advancing your character is a vital component of what makes this game fun for most players and while it is easy to be flippant and try to deride that reality you can't ignore it.<br />
<br />
Maybe you are blessed with the wide-eyed innocence to gaze in awed wonder at every boss, time and time again, as if it is the most wonderful thing you have ever seen, to revel in undiminished splendour each time you down him but if the first time they killed Marrowgar people were rewarded with 245 level loot an awful lot of them would never go there again and trying to pretend that adding a new instance in 2 or 3 months that drops 264 level loot wouldn't have the same effect on people is just silly.</div></div><hr />

<br />
About 50% of the reason to raid certainly is now, when every bit of content gets nerfed after a month or two and scrubs have your gear, there are hard modes true but 100 % + more effort and skill for a 10% better item, that become obsolete when the next tier is released and the handful of first bosses there are faceroll.</div></div><hr />

An MC upgrade might even be topical given that Ragnoros is supposed to make a reappearance in Cat. I don't see them doing it though, they got too much shit for &quot;recycling&quot; Naxx. I don't think people minded Ony so much because it was a one boss raid, and just sort of a cute &quot;Special Event&quot; kinda deal.</div></div><hr />

They're already planning to update SFK and... Stockades (? I think) for Wrath.<br />
<br />
And MC doesn't make sense since we're supposed to fight the real Ragnoros at 85, not some 10% half summoned version. So they can't make him as strong as an 80 boss with only 10% health and realistically make us fight him on the fire elemental plane at 100% in only 5 levels.</div></div><hr />

THe most creative level design. You actually feeled like beeing in some gigantic insect hive. And oh look at IIC. Wow blue steel everywhere. It just looks like mordor.<br />
If they dont bring back 40 man raids i will start playing on classic private servers! :-[</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I agree. Ever since I first set eyes on Gundrak, I've been waiting for a raid there, only to be disappointed that there wasn't.<br />
<br />
My hopes are that they use a Gundrak raid as a precursor to what's going to happen in Cataclysm. Maybe the trolls from Zul'Gurub and Zul'Aman sense what is going to happen in Cataclysm and go to take refuge inside Gundrak. I got this idea when on an alt I finished a quest in Zuldrak and it said &quot;you are now friendly with the Zandalar tribe.&quot; it didn't give any rep, but my rep bar did go to 0/6000 friendly. I think they could work it out into the lore.</div></div><hr />
