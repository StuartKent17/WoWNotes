Bashiok Leaves Blizzard<br />
We're sorry to see Bashiok leave and wish him the best in the future! <br />
I could pretty easily write a few thousand words right now, but I did my best to keep this brief.<br />
<br />
I began working at Blizzard way back in October of 2003, and every day of my experience here has been shared with you, the players, and content creators, artists, bloggers, AddOn authors, podcasters, streamers, forum trolls, and— man, anyone remember the old Off-Topic forum back in the day? That place was just absolutely cuckoo bananas.<br />
<br />
Anyway, Blizzard—and the community that surrounds it—has defined almost my entire adult life, and I am just so absolutely grateful to all of my friends here for having such an incredible and positive impact on who I am, and who I am yet to become. I don’t think I’ve had to make any decisions as difficult as the one to leave Blizzard, but a new opportunity has come my way, and I’ve decided to take it.<br />
<br />
While I think it’s all still sinking in, the other day I realized I actually get to be surprised by Blizzard announcements and releases again. Which, as a lifelong fan and rabid gamer it makes me giddy thinking about being able to sit in the audience at BlizzCon, watching a stream, or reading the newest blog posts, and seeing whatever’s in store next—for the first time.<br />
<br />
I’m looking forward to what’s next, and wishing you a life of joy, insatiable curiosity, and happy gaming.<br />
<br />
Definitely thankful,<br />
Bashiok</div></div><hr />

I usually stick up for Blizzard but Bashiok had a tendency to be an overly sarcastic, hostile, and dismissive douche who down talked anyone with negative feedback regardless of how constructive (or not) it was. I used to like him but the last few years his posts have such an arrogant tone that I've wondered how he's still there sometimes.</div></div><hr />

This is probably good. GC leaving was way worse....this...is meh. For the passed say 3 Blizzcons he's been the worst on the panels. Even the other Devs give him side glances when he says shit, with the faces of &quot;wtf dude, why would you say that.&quot; I don't think this will change much at all. Interested to see where he goes and how he does there. Most of these guys have made good money so they can now afford to go work somewhere else without a lot of fuss or transitional issues. More interested in what kind of game he goes to work on or if it is even a game at all.</div></div><hr />

yeah that tends to happen with communities as large and awful as the WoW community is. they hate you if you don't answer, they hate you if you DO answer. lose/lose situation when you're dealing with the community</div></div><hr />

Exactly. While he undoubtedly has had to put up with a lot of crap and nonconstructive posts, Bashiok's attitude in recent years has been better left not shown. Many of his posts simply fan the flames far more than what's reasonable and add nothing to a discussion. They act as middlemen and are the voice of the devs at times but Bashiok tends to just blast people or dismiss even constructive comments. Blue posts are supposed to be worth reading but Bashiok hasn't really added anything. When you see a Bashiok post lately you know it's going to be some cringeworthy arrogance or passive aggressive garbage. Sad when I did used to like him and his sense of humor.</div></div><hr />

I honestly wouldn't be surprised if he's just bored as fuck of WoW-- as much as I love to shit talk him. At least he was well humored along the way.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
lol @ the tools blaming him for game design decisions.<br />
<br />
They're not tools, they're just doing what Blizzard wanted and attributing the game to his online image. No need to name-call. <br />
<br />
CMs are hired based on their merit in accurately representing, and taking responsibility for the direction of a game or several games. In this case those projects were World of Warcraft and Diablo 3. Getting shit talked is explicitly what Bashiok signed up for, and what paid his bills. He was a representative, basically. <br />
<br />
Whipple was grandfathered into the job of a corporate spokesperson, blame was in the job description. The community will decide if he did a good job with that.</div></div><hr />

When you have idiots buying tokens to make easy gold (And the people who think they're laughing in Blizz's face by playing the game for *free* when in reality they made 5 more dollars off your sub then normal)...and cash grabs like HotS...maybe it is up...still doesn't negate the fact that WoW is a shitty product that they're screwing their customers over with it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also partly because the devs have gone radio silent as well. There's just extremely little information about the game being relayed from the devs to us, meaning the cms stay silent or put in their two cents about random shit.</div></div><hr />

The upside of being the community face of Blizz is that you get the praise when things go well. The downside of being the community face of Blizz is that you get all the blame when things go to shit.<br />
<br />
I have no doubt that the vast majority of WoD problems were directly caused by senior Blizz management. For all we knew Bashiok was trying to talk sense into them, but just didn't succeed. For all we knew Bashiok thought they were completely correct. Odds are, we will never really know (zero doubt he has an NDA preventing him from ever being frank about what was really going on behind the scenes).<br />
<br />
Overall, since senior management is making all the real decisions that matter (i.e. amount of funding that is actually being provided to WoW support / development), it probably will make no difference on whether WoW continues its decline or they turn it around.</div></div><hr />

Of course we're laughing in Blizzard's face. It is not OUR 5 dollars or euros they make, it is not even our full subscription value. They make all these extra money from the &quot;idiots buying tokens to make easy gold&quot; and we trade our free time to play a game FOR FREE (since it doesn't cost a single dime for us)&gt; If Blizzard makes more money from SOMEONE ELSE'S pocket, i couldnt friggin' care.<br />

Here's where you're wrong. Just because someone is acting like a child with a tantrum, doesn't mean you have the right to act the same way. You won't prove you're better by talking back to them, you'll prove it by just ignoring them or giving them a cultural and logical response. <br />

Problem is that's not so much the type of person you want in a community PR position. The quality of his posts have degraded so heavily over the years to where his dry humor began to get replaced by hostility. No one cared when they saw a Bashiok post, which is a problem. They would see it and think &quot;oh hey more passive aggressive dismissing of a concern&quot; or &quot;look more arrogant comments and intentional derailing.&quot;</div></div><hr />

At one point I was applying to be a CM at Blizzard and while I didn't get the job, I did get a brief summary of CM's responsibilities. <br />
The most important part of their job is to READ pretty much every opinion people have about Blizzard products, compile what they've read into an accessible form and then relay it to their higher-ups which in turn bring this feedback to the developers. CMs are also resposible for writing/translating the majority of the stuff that goes onto their fansites, managing social media, coming up and managing various contests and community stuff, interacting with the fansites and so on. <br />
<br />
Being a public image - i.e. appearing in the interviews as a &quot;moderator&quot; of sorts, taking part in community events, talking to people, appearing on stage during conventions, bringing information from the devs to the community and engaging community in a discussion is an important, but rather small part of their job :)</div></div><hr />

I don't think many people had a real issue with Bashiok until WoD (especially during the beta) where he's been over the top hostile and sarcastic and threads end up worse when he posts. It's one thing to fan the flames with discussion but another to throw gas on the fire like he had a tendency of doing.</div></div><hr />

Don't get me wrong, I was never one of those guys that want people fired, I just thought that his attitude and responses were usually unsuitable and sometimes even downright provoking. And while this can be okay for an edgy game designer, it's certainly not for a community manager. Of course dealing with the WoW community is difficult, but a job is a job.</div></div><hr />

Because a lot of people here are of the childish 'TEH CUSTOMER IS ALWAYS RIGHT' mentality, and think that they should be able to treat a CS rep like shit without any kind of reprisal, that they should get the 'you are absolutely correct sir!' treatment.<br />
<br />
Bashiok was great at playful sarcasm toward people like that, but I imagine he grew tired of it. I'd be fired in a week if I had to deal with the shit he does on the forums. The 'vocal minority' of this community repulses me sometimes.</div></div><hr />

You're pretty far off the mark here. Lots of fucks were given over Bashiok leaving. You don't have to look far to see people lamenting it.<br />
<br />
Whether you had some imaginary beef with him or not, fact is Bashiok was been with blizzard a long fucking time. It's always kind of sad to see someone bounce when they've been somewhere that long. It does create kind of a void.<br />
<br />
As many people are getting burned out and tired of WOW, seems the blues are having the same issue. I was thinking about this very thing just a couple of days ago funny enough, that many years ago I would've liked to work for blizz. But these days I wouldn't want to. Mainly because i'm just tired of WOW, I don't think i'd have the passion or drive to deal with it all day every day. And especially with the toxic bastards constantly ragging on everything you do out of woeful ignorance.<br />
<br />
Maybe he'll find something new he is passionate about. Hope they stop dropping like flies over there or it's the beginning of the end for WOW.</div></div><hr />

What? No. That means him leaving is still sinking in. As in, he knows he's leaving and all the time he realizes little things that will change, like being able to experience WoW and the announcements as any other player.

Bashiok was honestly a cool person and said things how it had to be. Players were awfully rude to him on the forums for no reason and I laughed and cheered when Bashiok would say something witty back to those players and players got so butthurt.</div></div><hr />

they talk about communicating with blizzard like its a human right to have any discussion with a company selling a product. At the end of the day they could just sell the game and that's it you buy it or don't, they have ZERO obligation to talk to us about ANYTHING.

As with most successful companies in any industry. The top talent are always head-hunted by other companies who aspire to become the same. This pay-rise/promotion plus a little fatigue from working in the same job for 10 years, is it that surprising they leave?<br />

When you look at them all, it does seem a little scary...but there is one thing that is also true for all of them at the same time. As individuals, not some conspiracy group, they each have been working at blizzard for a long fucking time, on one single game for a long fucking time. In the creative world its not uncommon to jump between job opportunities every 2-5 years, and these guys have been here on WoW for 12+ years...wouldn't you want to work on something new?</div></div><hr />

I agree with this, I occasionally look at some of the forum posts highlighted on MMO and the amount of sheer obnoxiousness from the fanbase is astounding. The fact a simple video game brings out so much hostility in people, so many posts which are merely thinly veiled insults attempting to put words in a persons mouth, always leaves me a little stunned that Blizzard can find people who continue to put up with it. Tseric said it best, no matter what the reply someone is going to act like you just killed their cat. Even a logical response that answers all concerns and sorts out misinformation is rarely met with gratitude and it seems the blues only have to turn around to find the same complaints being voiced in an even more entitled and aggressive manor, as if virtual pixels could be equated to a dictator cutting food rations for your family in half. <br />
As an aside it's always amused me how angry people who spend 2-4 hours a day bashing away at Blizzard on the forums can be so easily angered by the suggestion of time commitments in WoW. <br />
<br />
<br />
Either way, sinking ship allegories continue to show mass spread ignorance. Seems a lot of people don't understand that Blizzard's biggest flaw as a corporation is the high number of senior staff members who make it difficult for up-and-coming talent to find positions for creative input. Want an example? Diablo 3 was pushed out the door by senior devs and it wasn't until the game was handed over to new blood that it began to turn around.</div></div><hr />

Well lets see what they -promise- on gamescom but hey, after this xpac, i don't think they will put too much efforts in this game anymore. I don't believe WODs design was a &quot;mistake&quot; like &quot;oops, oh seems like i put a little bit too less effort into all of this and now people are, surprise suprise, pissed about it&quot;. i think its simply their strategy of shrinking down this huge colossus of a game into something like.. their new games maybe? 140 characters games like HotS or Overwatch.</div></div><hr />

Suddenly when they are leaving, people seems to change their tune, just to have someone else to complain about.<br />
<br />
Same was particularly noticeable with Ghostcrawler.<br />
Make up your minds people.<br />
Grow up and stop bandwagon jumping.<br />
<br />
<br />
Just go away, fanboy.<br />
<br />
Can't idiots like you go away.<br />
A fanboy by definition would require overly positive outlook on everything, when you jump to that conclusion on a very narrow subject.<br />
Same as every time, when they don't bother to look at the history of that poster, let alone the multiple that are often accused.<br />
Those using the fanboy accusation are a bunch of spoilt brats just jumping on a buzzword to cover up the fact that they have no argument.</div></div><hr />

The best way to make more and more money as you go through life is to change jobs once every 5 years, at the most. Unless you find yourself in some top CEO position making millions, if you have a GREAT CV, there's someone willing to hire you for more money than your current employer is willing to pay you. Companies hire for upper tier positions from outside. It's rare that they promote from within these days.</div></div><hr />

Look at the amount of moronic &quot;feedback&quot; he sifted through daily and position yourself in that role. <br />

As far as I'm concerned, there are three ways to deal with hundreds of people clamoring for combative viewpoints on trivial matters daily.<br />

<br />
So because a company has a lot of vacant positions it means they're having a hard time getting applicants? <br />
<br />
Good companies keep a number of positions open all the time so that anyone with extreme talent will be welcome to apply. Most jobs aren't like a guild where you can just whisper one of the officers and ask if they want your awesome skillz. You need a job to apply for, and if you go to apply for Blizzard and all they have are a customer service position and a managerial position open, then you're going to take your artistic/game design/creative/whatever skills elsewhere. Besides the fact that in a company who has what, 3000 employees state-side, you would expect there to consistently be a number of positions open.<br />
<br />
Also Bashiok leaving says nothing about the state of WoW, either. People leave companies all the time. If you believe that the only people who are happy with a company and its direction are those who have been there for 20 years, then you have a lot of growing up to do. I left a job I loved with excellent benefits and good pay in a great location after 4 years so that I could move and be closer to friends and family. Still think it was probably the best organization I ever worked for, yet here I am, not working there anymore.</div></div><hr />

a company like blizzard shouldn't have that many openings, unless there are &quot;reasons&quot;. a company like blizzard shouldn't have to advertise on its game launcher that it needs openings filled. It screams of skilled people just not wanting to work there, and that typically means that &quot;word&quot; is getting around the industry.</div></div><hr />

5 years is even quite a lot in many fields. I don't know many people in IT that have been working for the same company for the past 5 years for example. My longest was just around 4. And that had nothing to do with &quot;more money&quot;, just that I'm in a field where it's easy to find something else, where I can afford to change any time I want and know I'll find something interesting somewhere else if I want to.<br />
<br />
A company would have to offer incredible things (again, not specifically $$$) for me so stay anywhere close to 12 years as he did.</div></div><hr />

Though people have left companies in the past over creative differences, IE: when the company starts going away from the principles it was founded upon. IE: blizzard.<br />

In the end he was only human. That said, overall I usually enjoyed Bashiok's communications outside of the odd tweet or post (mostly within the past year and some change) and he'll certainly be missed for some of his more enjoyable quips that he'd hit people with. Hopefully the next person to sort of step into his shoes will have the enthusiasm to not allow the internet to get to'em and is able to make reading their posts enjoyable as well while improving the communication between the community and the Devs. <br />
<br />
Best of luck to Bashiok as he moves forward with his career and I hope that he finds the change of scenery refreshing and rekindles his enthusiasm for whatever he aspires to do moving forward.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">IxilaFA</div><div class="date">2015-07-31, 11:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">a company like blizzard shouldn't have that many openings, unless there are &quot;reasons&quot;. a company like blizzard shouldn't have to advertise on its game launcher that it needs openings filled. It screams of skilled people just not wanting to work there, and that typically means that &quot;word&quot; is getting around the industry.<br />
Please, tell me more about your wonderful insight into a multi-national corporation like Blizzard. Companies advertise for jobs for the exact reasons I mention: you don't want potential talent to feel like there's no point in applying. Just like the best guilds in WoW always list a shit-ton of class openings for new spots, a good company lists a shit-ton of job openings even if those jobs don't necessarily exist or are even needed. As an example, my company has an opening in my department right now, even though we don't really need someone for it. It's just in the budget to have a last person and the help would be welcome when we need it.<br />
<br />
<br />
People related to WoW are leaving, not that company as a whole. <br />
Where's your proof for this? The people who have left recently were Ghostcrawler, Rob Pardo, and Bashiok. Three of the most well-known and most vocal people from Blizzard. I would bet dollars to donuts there have been more than just those three that left the WoW team in the meantime, but we don't hear about them because they are not even known to us. Do you think the WoW development team really only consists of the people who have Twitter, have a forum account, and get up on stage at Blizzcon? <br />
<br />
Most people in the D3 and SC2 community are not so batshit insane that they relentlessly stalk, harrass, and judge every action of the developers of those games. That's why people can come and go in those departments without a lot of fanfare. <br />
<br />
<br />
Though people have left companies in the past over creative differences, IE: when the company starts going away from the principles it was founded upon. IE: blizzard.<br />
Leaving for creative differences isn't even a bad thing. It's probably one of the best reasons you can leave a company, outside of personal reasons. It just means you have one idea for what you'd like the company to do and the company has another. Any mature employee and organization recognizes this is a part of everyday life and not an end-of-the-world situation. If you really imagine a scenario where the Dev team of WoW is sitting there wishing they could leave while the higher-ups force them to design what you deem to be shitty content, then you know nothing about game development, the corporate atmosphere, or life in general.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Sound's like working customer service anywhere.<br />
<br />
I bet he was payed well for what he did.<br />
You could pay me 300k a year, if I had to deal with the WoW community I'd leave it in an instant.<br />
<br />
The WoW community (myself included) does not often realize how whiny and toxic we really are. I do not envy anyone who has to deal with us, even if they get paid well.<br />
<br />
<br />
Only people related to WoW are leaving.<br />
<br />
There, that better? Rob left while working on WoD. Ghostcrawler left while working on MoP. Bash was CM for WoW and D3.<br />
Again, where's your proof? Do you have a list of all the people who left Blizzard in the last two years? Rob Pardo, by all accounts, left Blizzard while he wasn't really doing anything. The biggest assumption is that he left because Titan was scrapped, which was his darling for years, and then he decided to pursue his own ventures. The guy was a VP for God's sake, he's probably sitting on an island sipping margaritas somewhere. Ghostcrawler has made it clear in tweets why he left; he didn't want to be handcuffed by WoW's design plan anymore. He went to LoL which is a notoriously hardcore game that doesn't take into account the casual player. That's it. There's nothing wrong with it, he just didn't agree with the casual mentality of WoW's designers anymore. Again, this is a normal part of everyday life in the upper echelons of corporate America. And you said yourself that Bash was a CM, which means he had hardly any say in what the design of the game was, which means if the design of WoW was really his motivating factor for leaving then he's an idiot. <br />
<br />
<br />
Seriously, you guys need to calm down and recognize that spending 12 years at a place is a long freakin' time. 12 years working at the same company is longer than I've even been in the work force period, and I've had 8 jobs in that time, with my longest one lasting 5 years. Inspired and motivated people seek positions elsewhere when they feel like they can earn it. It's the reason I've had so many jobs and now make more money than most of my peers, since I sought new positions in other companies rather than stay in a job where there was no further chance of promotion.</div></div><hr />

I've never seen Bashiok say anything that wasn't deserved. Dealing with smarmy kids and pricks all day long would get old. Who could blame him for going for new adventures elsewhere.<br />
<br />
Your certainty is misplaced then. It wasn't even on the forums, nor was he mentioned in my tweet, which was related to stream Q&amp;A questions usually being too cherry-picked and safe, to which he jumped in by saying he couldn't wait to ban me on twitch. If you think such light criticism is worthy of a ban, I'm sorry you're so blinded by your loyalty to a corporation.</div></div><hr />

People with great CV's switch jobs all the time, even from successful companies; just to another successful company that offers more or offers something they want. Bashiok stuck it out for 12 years, which is WAY more than most devs or any type of IT people stay in one job.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think it could actually be called Internet Syndrome.<br />
<br />
Comparing the attitude of the general (Internet active) population from 15 years ago until today, I'd say increasingly &quot;tired&quot;, &quot;bitter&quot; and &quot;cynical&quot; are the words that comes most evidently to mind. The phenomenon just seems reinforced for people who spend a lot of time online.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You would know definitely that the customer is almost never right. Maybe 1% of the time.It's a fine line. The customer isn't always right, but Consumer's Rights are real and companies are often finding new ways to fuck over said consumers and people who defend a company clearly doing so are feeding into a very rampant problem that's been spreading to the video game industry.<br />
<br />
If people don't call out shitty practice and poor service then it will become the norm. Companies that sell products should be held to some kind of expected standard and when they fail that standard then you as a customer have every right to complain and make it known that you paid and you are not satisfied.</div></div><hr />
