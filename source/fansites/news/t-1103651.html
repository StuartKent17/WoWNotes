You should definitely check the emotes video at least, the art work on Pandaren animations is pretty impressive and look like they will be a refreshing change. <br />

The facial animation is in a completely different league to what we're used to from WoW.The only problem is the original models are an embarrassment next to this.

Nothing wrong with that, it's kinda refreshing to have a race who is cutesy. Female gnomes aren't alone anymore. :)</div></div><hr />

I move my lips while reading a part or re-reading a philosophy passage I want to memorize. The extra thought placed into mouthing the words helps retention...so I guess there are many, MANY retards out there.</div></div><hr />

Male pandaren seem to me alot more authentic and if I'd ever decide to play a male I'd go for that one. Though of course it's just my personal taste, so no need to flame me for it. :P The old models will slowly but surely get upgraded, as they said, first dwarves, then humans and orcs, then probably gnomes/night elves + trolls/tauren/undead, and last blood elves and draenei. Imo orcs and trolls need one pretty badly, even if it's just a few more faces being available to choose from. We'll see what they come up with. Shame they don't think that Worgen need an upgrade. They're absolutely horrible and monotone for a rather new race.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because the brown ones aren't supposed to be traditional pandas, they're more reminiscent of red pandas, which are kind of like the love-child of a raccoon and a panda.<br />
<br />
In a lot of Samwise's Pandaren art, the females are typically red pandas while the males and children are tubby Giant Pandas.</div></div><hr />

They have the same stance, same basic body structure. I can understand Blizzard recycling models for NPCs, mounts, etc, but NOT for player races...</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ruak</div><div class="date">2012-03-25, 02:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Blizzard have been giving excuses with 'time', 'resources', etc, since the dawn of time. &quot;We know this is wanted, we really want to do this but it takes up a lot of resources so we don't know when we can implement it&quot;. Character models have been in the scope of the community for years probably. What was their art team busy with in terms of Cata? 5 new skins and mediocre sets and 95 other reskins? The company has the most resources, human potential, know-how and whatnot of any other developer out there, yet they're the slowest, and I really mean it, by far the slowest content-releasing mmo developer out there.<br />
<br />
What annoys me the most is that all their promises are kind of the small carrots on a stick that drives the playerbase into paying the next and the next monthly sub in hope of receiving the beloved update sooner rather than later, but we always end up waiting for ages till they fix stuff (and sometimes this stuff is rather obvious). Example - Ret paladin rotation and its crappyness. Even on the PTR people kept reporting it's shit, it's random, it's clumsy, it's annoying. Devs said &quot;no, that's not true, just try it out properly on live, you'll see it's good&quot;. It goes live, reaction the same, a month later Blizzard admit &quot;yeah, ok, Ret rotation is crappy, but you have to wait till next expansion till we can fix it as we can't introduce a fix now&quot;. <br />
<br />
I mean... For real? And I kinda have the same feeling about new animations and models that people want. I don't think it takes YEARS to update them. But the Pandaren animations are sick (really good, I just have to admit it), so why not introduce another carrot on a stick? 2 months later they put 1-2 races updated. What do people do? Reroll alts cause they really want to play with a newly animated toon. Bam, 2 months of gametime payed. A few months later they introduce 2 more races. What do people do? Right - roll alts again, as the urge to play such awesome animated toons is too irresistable. Bam, 2-3 more months of game time payed. <br />
<br />
And there you go, only because of this you can have literally millions of players subscribing long-term. Easy way to milk out some more cash with less effort than necessary. Add the other part of the solid fanbase who plays no matter what, add some new additions like pet combat (oh noes...) and you keep a playerbase subscribing without actually providing enough content for the bucks they're paying. Sorry, but I still keep my opinion about Blizzard as low as possible and this just kind of confirms it. <br />

If you go to a top ranked school and do not move your lips when you read then you are handicapping yourself. Mouthing the words increases cognitive understanding of the passage and retention of the content. It seems that &quot;retards&quot; have a competitive advantage over you.</div></div><hr />

Ahhhh, I was waiting for someone to link the infamous Ty Lee video, lolol (Could someone please describe her face for me? My eyes never seem to be able to go that far up... :confused: lol)<br />
<br />
Honestly though, I think the 3 moves in the animated video are more likely to make it in than the full dance...and I'd be just fine with that -- I'd still hear that damn song every time I saw it regardless, lol (ooh, ooh, ooah, ooah-ah)<br />
And yeah, the animations here are absolutely ridiculous (love the male sitting... /zen lol). Even after just watching the videos, I feel like I could never go back to playing a classic race...even Blood Elves and Draenei are iffy... :/<br />

I predict the loses are going to accelerate. I doubt alot of the annual pass people will be re-upping to be honest, even if MoP hits before Sept.</div></div><hr />

(are all the negatives getting filtered?) or are people just easy to please?I don't like panda's myself but I will be buying MoP... just because I want to continue to play BG's.<br />
<br />
I would rather see them upgrade those old models and why noone is whining about the fact that druid's travel form is not up to par with it's bear and cat form textures is beyond me. (same goes for shaman ghost wolf form) it sure can't be that much work to redo these atleast? jees. <br />
The argument that not everyone has the best pc is also really getting old after a while, you can't choose worgens/goblins to look as bad as humans and make your pc run WoW better ANYWAY. so what the heck.<br />
<br />
What's wrong with some criticism at times? And yes I do actually think WoW is still great. ( for now)</div></div><hr />

WoW's graphics are really begining to become dated. The artistic vision is still strong, and the animators at Blizzard are top notch, but at some point they're going to need to overhaul the engine. <br />
<br />
I think Cataclysm's 1-60 content revamp was wasted money ultimately, no way this engine is lasting another 5 years competitively.<br />
<br />
What I find pathetic in this day and age are people who base the quality of a game soley off its graphics. Wow is dated? Well duh, it was made 7 years ago, but that doesn't change the fact that despite the Negative-Nancy's its STILL a good game and the graphics don't effect this. It could be a 16bit dinosaur running on the Atari and as long as it was fun, its pixel graphics wouldn't change this. With its dated engine, and being made 7 years ago does in fact make the graphics for MoP rather impressive. It's not like its running off some high end machine or anything.</div></div><hr />

No idea, but at this point I'm just hoping it's not based off of a dance by an anal-retentive celebrity. :/</div></div><hr />
