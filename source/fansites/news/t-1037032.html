<br />
Update: Blizzard posted an official statement (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/208410/raid-finder-loot-exploit-suspensions) on the LFR exploit bans.<br />
<br />
PvP Season 11 Begins<br />
This season brings new gear and Alizabal (http://www.wowpedia.org/Alizabal), the new Baradin Hold boss. Keep in mind that all ratings will be reset (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/205701/pvp-season-10-ending-soon) and higher item level honor gear (http://db.mmo-champion.com/items/?level=390&amp;name__imatches=Ruthless) will be added. Any honor that you have over the 4,000 cap will be converted to gold. <br />
<br />
Alizabal, Mistress of Hate<br />
The Kirin Tor imprisoned Alizabal in their formidable Violet Hold not long after corrupt magi summoned the shivarra into Azeroth. Despite arcane wards restricting her powers, the demon's malicious influence alone caused her guards to murder one another in sudden fits of rage. Her transfer to Baradin Hold prior to the Cataclysm has only aggravated the ruined prison's increasingly dire conditions.<br />
<br />
&lt;img src=&quot;http://urbad.net/tmp/icons/tank.png&quot; /&gt; Skewer<br />
Alizabal skewers and stuns her current target for 8 sec. Skewer also inflicts 10000 Physical damage every 2 sec. and increases the target's damage taken by 150%.<br />
<br />
Seething Hate<br />
Alizabal incites Seething Hate in a random player, inflicting 600000 total Fire damage to all players within 6 yards of the target. The damage is split amongst all of the nearby players.<br />
<br />
Blade Dance<br />
Alizabal enters a Blade Dance and inflicts 12500 Physical damage every sec. to every player within 13 yards. The Blade Dance also deflects all incoming attacks.<br />
<br />
<br />
Weapons<br />
<br />
Cataclysmic Gladiator (Season 11) Weapons - ilvl 397 (http://db.mmo-champion.com/items/2/?name__imatches=Cataclysmic&amp;level=397)<br />

They advertised it as being a raid you can do multiple times in a week with no lockout. I don't ever remember reading that if you participate in a boss, you are locked regardless of whether or not you roll. It's also pretty ridiculous that if you roll on the Chaos orb at the end, you get locked. All around, there is absolutely no benefit to doing raid finder more than once a week.</div></div><hr />

Perhaps you should get in on a fail group then, with lockouts active. Then I'm sure the benefit of no lockout will become clear after a wipefest. :&gt;<br />

The no lock out means that you wont be locked out of normal or heroic ... not that you won't get locked form the LFR. -.o Blizzard isn't stupid, they aren't going to make a super easy raid and just let every one and their brother gear up in hours. If people got the wrong idea that is their fault, its still a raid, easy mode or not. If you cant farm normals or heroics in a day or two then you can't do it to the LFR.<br />

Blizzard explicitly states in their terms of service that you are not to exploit any bugs. &quot;Other people did it&quot; and &quot;I didn't know what Blizz would do about&quot; aren't excuses in the slightest. The only people to blame are those that chose to exploit the bug rather than report it. They knew what they were doing was wrong.</div></div><hr />

Yeah with this logic, I guess the candy that you see in the isle's of a grocery store is so obvious, and just baiting you to steal it right, but hmmm, I wonder what would happen if you got caught doing it, when it was clear that you knew you weren't supposed to.<br />

Exploiting bugs is against the rules you are supposed to read before logging in. Stfu and take your ban without whining, cheater.<br />
<br />
Especially top guilds who keep themselves up to date KNOW LFR was supposed to be 1 time per boss only. Also, don't whine about ban durations, making it 7 days would make no one care because you'd be unbanned for HC raiding and world rankings. 8 days actually hurts. Good job, Blizzard.</div></div><hr />

If you exploit, completely disregarding the terms of service you agree to, you absolutely will not win the suit. You would be wasting your money.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vallius</div><div class="date">2011-12-06, 07:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's easy to pass judgment on these guys. That was my knee-jerk reaction, as well. &quot;FOUL! These hacks are pros?! That's how you get number 1? You cheat?!&quot; <br />
<br />
But, really, this situation is so much more complex than it's face value components. Good vs. Evil, Right vs. Wrong. Concepts that are ultimately perception and open to interpretation. You have to look at this from a competitive point of view, not just as a White Knight of the Forum Collective. All of these guilds knew that what they were doing was wrong and, at least in Paragon's case, expected to get some form of reprimand for having done so. Hell, they openly stated that they hoped Blizzard would react severely by setting a standard of, &quot;hey, we're not going to tolerate this behavior&quot; so that, in essence, their joining in on an exploit that was meant to level a competitive playing field would yield the same results in the aftermath for all involved. They were stuck between a rock and a hard place and in this situation the moral high-ground wasn't the clearest path. <br />
<br />
They have sponsors and fans and community sites following their progress and measuring them against each other on an hour by hour basis. I'm sure that kind of pressure didn't help their decision-making process much. These guys are competitive players and you can't expect them to be 100% perfect all the time especially when you're in a situation like this, one with so many variables working against you. By that same token, yes, they should have known better and set a good example, but this is an unrealistic and naive assertion given the circumstance.<br />
<br />
Now, let me be clear. I'm in no way endorsing what these guys did. It -was- wrong of them to cheat. That much is clear and, again, Paragon admitted as much and stated that (at least for them) they'd gladly accept whatever punishment comes their way and I'm sure a few of the other guilds feel the same way (maybe). This will set a precedent going forward that if you're found to be exploiting Blizzard are not just going to pass out 72 hour bans anymore. They're going to wreck your raiding progress for the next week and put the dunce cap on your head and make an example of you. <br />
<br />
As for me, I just had to ask myself after really looking at the situation what I would have done or at least tried to understand how they could have come to the decision they did and the justification for doing so. All of these guilds knew that they had to make a risky game decision that would result in either A) getting away with it and coming out ahead or B) everyone would get the hammer for doing so and the playing field would be leveled. <br />
<br />
So guys, please try to look at this from their point of view, too. It's easy to just raise your moral hammer and slam it down thusly without having been in that situation yourself under that kind of pressure. I'm not saying it was right, but I don't think I have the right to gauge how I would have reacted in a scenario I've never been in.</div></div><hr />

Bugs and glitches happen - taking advantages of said bugs is the definition of an exploit... If you have an issue with their coding - do better - The biggest companies in the world still have loopholes and bugs in their software, when you find a way around the limits and abuse it, expect to be dealt with... the guilds that pushed this expected just that and they aren't whining about it.</div></div><hr />

On-topic: <br />
The guilds that exploited knew very well that this was one of the possible scenario's but they decided to do it anyways. If I was raiding with a top guild, I would have reported the issue, waited 24 hours and see what happened. That still would have given me enough time to exploit if Blizzard didn't fix the issue. <br />
<br />
The blame is NOT on Blizzard (I really want it to be, but it isn't). The LFR rules were clearly stated before and finding a bug to go around that rule is bug abuse and exploiting. The top guilds knew in advance that this could get them a ban, but due to the pressure of the race (and being impatient imo) they decided to go on. The 8 day ban symbolizes one week of progress which will hurt them a lot in the race. It will definitely affect the world ranking. But I hope they will still do their best to compete. <br />
<br />
Lesson learned, I'd say !</div></div><hr />

<br />
Still not sure if serious...<br />
<br />
Ofcourse they are gonna reimburse his account, if they made a mistake and banned someone for the wrong reasons they will ofcourse correct it, if not they loose a good customer for no reason at all.<br />

My point is that everything related to World of warcraft is blizzards property, we are simply renting the service.<br />

I don't ever remember reading that if you participate in a boss, you are locked regardless of whether or not you roll. It's also pretty ridiculous that if you roll on the Chaos orb at the end, you get locked. All around, there is absolutely no benefit to doing raid finder more than once a week.<br />

Yes it does, every single guild who's competing for world first will have done this and received bans. Now it's time to see if these players have a second account to play on. The world first will just be one week later than usual, but it will still be the same names up top. Unless my guild who, ranking around 200 (last I saw) in the world who completed Heroic Rag about 2 months after world first will suddenly jump the gun and kill it while the other guilds are on their ban.</div></div><hr />

No, no, and no. That's like saying a rapist isn't at fault if a woman is wearing revealing clothing because shes that much closer to being naked. It was ALWAYS on the onus of the player not to exploit a bug. Just because Blizzard, after hearing all the endless whining about not having enough content, releases a patch without every single bug fixed, does not give the player permission to exploit that bug. How you can think otherwise fucking blows my mind away.</div></div><hr />

There has been a lot of misinformation going around, so to clear things up, here is a truthful account of what exactly happened with the LFR and what we have to say about it:<br />
<br />
The patch hit EU servers on Wednesday. We started off with our 5x Firelands runs to wrap up legendaries and called it a night. For Thursday, we had an elaborate plan to run a personal LFR raid for every main character to get the maximum amount of loot.<br />
<br />
As we were doing the first few runs, we noticed an unrealistic amount of tier pieces on some guilds' armory profiles, which we thought was unattainable through normal means. We started looking into it, and found out that you can loot passed gear from bosses, regardless of save status, if you zone out and back into the instance. This did not provide the raid with any extra loot, but it did eliminate a major portion of the RNG that would have been involved in simply doing personal runs for everyone.<br />
<br />
We acknowledge that using this unintended behavior, which was quite clearly a bug, to our gain, was wrong. The fact that others were using it as well is no justification for doing it ourselves. We apologize for doing it, and accept whatever consequences follow.</div></div><hr />

You break the rules, you get punished.<br />
Just like if someone leaves their window open and you crawl in and steel their stuff, you are still a robber and get punished, not the one who left the window open.<br />
Now we will see, who are the REAL TOP guilds with some moral and honor left, instead of all these bug exploiting lowlifes.</div></div><hr />

I think most people on this board have never played a highly competitive sport in their life. Not trying to be condescending, but if you have never experienced true competition in an environment which is not always 100% flawless in terms of its use of rules, you won't understand the way this entire situation worked out.<br />
<br />
The concept is really simple, actually, but it's hard to vicariously experience the intense emotion involved with competition of a certain level. <br />
<br />
Why do some high school athletes take performance enhancing drugs? It's because other athletes do, and if they don't &quot;keep up,&quot; they could lose something which only comes around once in a year (say, a championship), or even once in a lifetime (say, a scholarship). I think there are a lot of monday morning quarterbacks here, but you don't really know how this situation feels until you're faced with it.<br />
<br />
The elite guilds were faced with a conundrum:<br />
<br />
a) Don't exploit, and take the risk that Blizzard will find out about the exploit of the other guilds AND penalize them to the extent that their advantage evens the playing field (e.g. taking away the gear, or a suspension)<br />
b) Don't exploit, no one gets penalized, and you are at a severe disadvantage for competition<br />
c) Exploit like everyone else, even the playing field, and everyone has a fair shot.<br />
<br />
I think the ban to these guilds is unnecessary. If most of them were doing it simply to &quot;keep up&quot; with the competition, no one really had a distinct advantage. Therefore, everything should have simply been normalized and the tier should have continued as though this never happened.</div></div><hr />

I think all these week one shenanigans could have easily been avoided by allowing heroic mode to be accessed right from the start. LFR and normal mode difficulties clearly are not designed with &quot;top tier&quot; guilds in mind and as a result these guilds will do anything they can to prepare themselves for the following week because it is just too easy to execute. The truth is it is getting out of hand, having to run LFR or split raids just so you have every gear advantage you can get. I can see how other guilds would feel pressured into abusing the LFR system as our guild was faced with the very decision simply because we would not want to fall behind. How is that fun? I guess what I am wondering is, what happened to the &quot;do what you want, when you want&quot; mentality that was mentioned at Blizzcon. I guess all the forum trolls would be out a job if things actually made sense.http://vodka-guild.net/<br />

<br />
Shrymp,<br />
What you are implying is the cheater's mentality. It is a way of justifying what they know is wrong, simply to be 'creative and playing on a level playing field.' First off, you do not know what kind of competition we have experienced, both in game and in real life. While it is obviously true that the vast majority of the remaining 10 or so million playerbase are not part of the small handful of super elite guilds in this game, most of us do have quite a bit of experience in competitive environments, sometimes hyper competitive environments (I have experienced this both in team sports and in academic fields).<br />
<br />
While it is very easy to cheat and play against the rules, and yes, the majority of cheaters never get caught, let alone punished, one still has to live with what one did. Use every advantage, sure, but play within the rules, whatever those rules may be.<br />
<br />
Let me ask you a question: if you worked in a large investment firm as an investor adviser, would you lie, cheat, steal your way to high volume and profits? Would you justify it that if you don't do it, someone else will, and take your profits? Would you justify it that your colleagues who are stealing the little old lady's retirement savings are probably not gonna get caught? Where would you draw the line?<br />
<br />
Cheating is cheating. Trying to &quot;play on a level field&quot; is just an excuse to make yourself feel better about what you did. If your conscience can handle it, by all means, do it. Or you can take the route vodka took and not cheat, despite the intense pressure to do so. Hopefully this extra week of practice and 2 weeks of gearing will help them beat out all the guys who tried your excuse and failed. While it may not happen all the time, or even most of the time, justice does win some of the time. Here's hoping that the good guys win this one time, just as teams like Paragon did at one point.</div></div><hr />

Or you can take the route vodka took and not cheat, despite the intense pressure to do so. Hopefully this extra week of practice and 2 weeks of gearing will help them beat out all the guys who tried your excuse and failed.<br />

+10000 Internets for you sir. Couldn't have said it better myself.<br />

Sad that Shrymp is the sort to believe that &quot;in life,&quot; cheating to get ahead is reserved for &quot;creative&quot; people. No sir, it's reserved for scumbags. Take your lion's share, feel good about yourself, enjoy the instant gratification while you can- it's a long and lonely road ahead.</div></div><hr />

Of course it's not ridiculous. People need to be held accountable for their behaviour. They chose to use the exploits to benefit themselves and to push their guilds ahead. Next time they'll think twice before using the exploits. Good on you Blizzard!!</div></div><hr />

I understand it must suck when people are counting on you and your sponsor is counting on you and you see the other teams getting an ( unfair) advantage. That is still no reason to give in and do something you know is wrong. Take Blood Legion, for example. They got geared the best way they could without any exploits. Now if they didn't ban the other top guilds or took away their loot, would it be fair to guild like Blood Legion, who got theirs in a fair way? Wouldn't that be a bit like punishing who did the right thing and rewarding those who didn't? It's not like the top guild who exploited were forced to do it or had no other way to be competitive. Most of these people have been raiding for years, how did they do it before LFR?<br />
<br />
I do, however, applaud Paragon for taking their bans like men instead of whining endlessly about how unfair it is and &quot;but everyone was doing it!&quot;. Can't wait to see how the rankinkgs for this tier are going to be.</div></div><hr />

Its like a big red button in the middle of the screen that says DO NOT PUSH. What the hell were they expecting?<br />
<br />
And if you actually knew anything about bug testing you would know that not all bugs appear on the test servers.Some appear after they go live.<br />
<br />
For example I play Star Trek Online and there have been some pretty bad bugs that have appeared on the live server that simply were not on the testing server.Being warped to Deep Space 9 randomly no matter what you were doing or where you were,bugs that broke the mission creator,Q not giving the double XP buff to Klingon players etc etc...just to name a couple and there have been many more.<br />
<br />
Just accept the fact that bugs are part of software development and not all can be caught if they do not appear until it goes live.And if you are one that is stupid enough to try and exploit it you deserve whatever punishment Blizzard decides to hand to you.<br />
<br />
All I can say is three cheers for Blizzard for doing the right thing to cheaters.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tyrianth</div><div class="date">2011-12-06, 02:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think most people on this board have never played a highly competitive sport in their life. Not trying to be condescending, but if you have never experienced true competition in an environment which is not always 100% flawless in terms of its use of rules, you won't understand the way this entire situation worked out.<br />
<br />
The concept is really simple, actually, but it's hard to vicariously experience the intense emotion involved with competition of a certain level. <br />
<br />
Why do some high school athletes take performance enhancing drugs? It's because other athletes do, and if they don't &quot;keep up,&quot; they could lose something which only comes around once in a year (say, a championship), or even once in a lifetime (say, a scholarship). I think there are a lot of monday morning quarterbacks here, but you don't really know how this situation feels until you're faced with it.<br />
<br />
The elite guilds were faced with a conundrum:<br />
<br />
a) Don't exploit, and take the risk that Blizzard will find out about the exploit of the other guilds AND penalize them to the extent that their advantage evens the playing field (e.g. taking away the gear, or a suspension)<br />
b) Don't exploit, no one gets penalized, and you are at a severe disadvantage for competition<br />
c) Exploit like everyone else, even the playing field, and everyone has a fair shot.<br />
<br />
I think the ban to these guilds is unnecessary. If most of them were doing it simply to &quot;keep up&quot; with the competition, no one really had a distinct advantage. Therefore, everything should have simply been normalized and the tier should have continued as though this never happened.<br />
<br />
You know what happens when you get caught taking steroids in sports? You get banned.<br />
<br />
People are welcome to cheat the system all they want. But if they get caught they damn well better be prepared to face the consequences. These bans were completely justified.</div></div><hr />

How were they &quot;trying to justify&quot; anything? &quot;Trying to justify&quot; would mean that they tried to dodge the blaim, where as they actually gave a full apology for abusing a bug, and would accept any penalty. Kudos to Paragon for taking it that way I'd say.</div></div><hr />

This, a thousand times this.<br />

They cheated, got caught and now have to face the consequences. A bug in the game is blizzards fault, but that doesn't give player a free pass to cheat and abuse as they please. <br />

Given that the bosses in Baradin Hold can be considered to be 'PvP'-bosses, there is no reason for them to require crazy PvE-skills. The best you can get out of these bosses are a few normal tier set items, which are worth fairly little in the long run.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The LFR tool is dumb and misleading. They advertised it as being a raid you can do multiple times in a week with no lockout. I don't ever remember reading that if you participate in a boss, you are locked regardless of whether or not you roll. It's also pretty ridiculous that if you roll on the Chaos orb at the end, you get locked. All around, there is absolutely no benefit to doing raid finder more than once a week.<br />
<br />
The intent is one chance at loot per boss.<br />
<br />
The reason you can do it multiple times at all is to combat this scenario:<br />
<br />
1. Queue for LFR<br />
2. Pop into LFR on the last boss, because someone quit after getting loot they needed/group wiped repeatedly/etc.<br />
3. Do the last boss and be unable to even get one attempt at earlier bosses due to now being locked to the raid.<br />
<br />
Now it's:<br />
1. Queue for LFR<br />
2. Pop into LFR at the last boss<br />
3. Win.<br />
4. Queue for LFR<br />
5. Pop into LFR at the first boss<br />
6. Drop after you've done the boss(es) you need.<br />
<br />
That said, it's currently possible to randomly end up in an LFR that has nothing up you're not already locked to.<br />
<br />
Personally, it'd be nice if all raids worked this way -- we had to play musical raiders on a Firelands run to finish off some legendaries because two people were already locked to Shannox, thus ineligible to join the raid until we downed Shannox on alts.</div></div><hr />

There are lots of bugs in every patch and there's no way people are going to find them all. And even if someone finds a bug, it may not get fixed because there are higher priority bugs to be fixed.

<br />
Actually it is a 'wrong from the players' from the moment they made the choice to start abusing the exploit. Certainly some fault can go to Blizzard for not fixing the problem, but the players involved should have had the common sense to avoid causing the exploit to happen. Now, before people are like 'omg they no know they expoit... BLIZZARD FAULT', the exact sequence of events that was required for this exploit to be carried out properly is highly unlikely to happen in a completely normal raid setting. I suppose, rather, I should say it is unlikely to happen once in a raid setting; but the 20+ times in a row that several of these guilds made the decision to cheat... there's really no way of getting around the fact that they knew exactly what they were doing, they knew the possible consequences, and decided to proceed. Any of them arguing now that the suspension is unjust, honestly don't have a leg to stand on.</div></div><hr />

As for me, I'm going to leave it to the professionals and not be retarded enough not to break the rules that they put out THE MOMENT YOU LOGGED ON AFTER DOWNLOADING THE PATCH.</div></div><hr />

Of course, I see a post from a friend this morning about having receiving a 72-hour ban for supposedly using this exploit for loot. I know better than to think he ever did anything on purpose like this, since it's just not like him, but apparently they don't see it that way. He got a neck piece out of an LFR raid and that was it. Not multiple pieces of anything, just one piece of loot. He contacted blizzard to find out why he was banned and to petition it with, you know, facts about what happened, and they informed him that if he continued to create tickets about the incident and complain, he would be receiving an extension to his suspension.Aren't they nice.</div></div><hr />

You exploit, you get a suspension. Bug left in the system that leads to an exploit? You leave it alone. Don't screw on your puppy-dog eyes and wibbly lower lip with a &quot;BUT EVERYONE ELSE WAS DOIN' IIIITT!&quot; bawl ready. &quot;BLIZZARD LEFT THE EXPLOIIIT IIIIIIN~&quot; Yeah, and the next time you leave your window open, I'll just pop in and nab your stereo. Why not, you left the window open, trusting in the good faith that someone wouldn't reach in and steal something while your back was turned. You exploit, you take a little break from the game. No ifs, ands, or buts. End of goddamn list. Daily Blink was hilarious. I'm looking forward to the comical misadventures of my resident mage friend concerning that ability.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i never lost respect for blizzard for not taking quick action, i lost respect for the top guild who had to cheat because &quot;everyone else was doing it&quot;<br />
<br />
im glad they got banned.<br />
<br />
because half of the world top guild are temporarily suspended 1 week. what is point of race if the top dogs are not even in the race anyway? the whole point of world first race was the crazy competition and now there are none</div></div><hr />

Might want to proofread these images before you post them on the main page for everyone to see before someone raises a stink about it. Not very intelligent.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alayea</div><div class="date">2011-12-07, 05:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Glad to hear that Blizzard has issued suspensions over the LFR exploit. I think it ought to have been a minimum of 8 days to 12 days max, though, because otherwise it feels rather lenient. Still, a punishment is a punishment. And sorry, but I'm one of those people who won't take the &quot;everyone else was doing it&quot; excuse.</div></div><hr />
