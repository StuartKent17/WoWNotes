<br />
Patch 6.2.3 - Earning Valor<br />
Blizzard released some more details on the Valor coming in Patch 6.2.3 today. It looks like players will be able to earn up to 4875 Valor per week. <br />
We’ve just updated our Patch 6.2.3 preview blog post with the following details:<br />
<br />
Upgrading an item costs 250 Valor for +5 item levels. Hellfire Citadel items, Dungeon loot, Baleful items, and crafted items can each be upgraded twice, costing a total of 500 Valor for +10 item levels. There is no hard weekly cap on Valor, but the sources of Valor are inherently not infinitely repeatable. Valor can be earned in the following ways: Mythic Dungeon (Valor awarded with dungeon completion, once per dungeon per week) – 300 Valor Points Complete the weekly Event quest from Seer Kazal (Pet Battle Event excluded) – 500 Valor Points Heroic Dungeon (complete your first random Heroic of the day) – 100 Valor Points Raid Finder wing (once per week per wing) – 150 Valor Points for Hellfire Citadel wings, 75 Valor Points for Highmaul and Blackrock Foundry wings<br />
<br />
If you have any further questions on this, feel free to ask them here.<br />
<br />
Please note: On the current PTR, Mythic Dungeons are awarding only 150 Valor Points. This will be fixed to the intended value of 300.<br />
<br />
Does this include the PvP events? So you win 10 skirmishes and get 500 CP and 500 VP?<br />
Yes.<br />
<br />
Why is the Pet Battle event excluded, but not the PvP events?<br />
The Pet Battle challenge is excluded because it and pet battling are account-wide.<br />
<br />
A hard cap on earning Valor (or any currency) essentially sets a weekly benchmark, and falling short of that benchmark leaves you feeling like you've left something on the table. If we artificially cap earning at 1000/week, then we're saying it takes ~8 weeks to fully upgrade your gear, assuming &quot;maximum&quot; effort each week. If you miss a week, then you're a week &quot;behind.&quot; If you're busy, or sick, or just don't feel like it, and you fall a bit short of the cap one week, then you are delaying completion by precisely that amount. The existence of the cap makes the whole thing feel more mandatory in a sense, with motivation level then plummeting the moment you hit that weekly cap. Despite all these reasons, sometimes we do need caps as a pacing mechanism, particularly early in an expansion or where the impact on player power is massive (e.g. buying Conquest gear in a new arena season).<br />
<br />
Without a cap, there's an inherent diminishing return curve at play. You can start off doing the most efficient and engaging activities first, until you've exhausted those, leaving you with activities that are progressively less efficient and/or less suited to your playstyle preferences, combined with the fact that you also inherently are exhausting your free time as you go, with your remaining time presumably becoming more valuable as it dwindles. At some point, you generally hit a threshold where the reward for the next incremental activity no longer seems worth the time investment required, and you're done for the week. For many people, that threshold will be reached at lower than 1000 VP per week, and their experience is no different whether or not there's a cap. For others, that threshold will be reached at a point above 1000 VP, and the lack of a cap gives them the freedom to decide when they're done rather than having it dictated to them. Some will benefit from the fact that they're allowed to convert a weekend of free time into a bunch of Valor to make up for that week when they were busy or traveling, coming out even or ahead rather than being permanently &quot;behind&quot; due to a cap.<br />
<br />
(The particular nature of Valor upgrades also adds another element of diminishing returns - your first 2k Valor will likely go into your weapons and trinkets. After that, every additional point of Valor you earn is progressively less impactful as you work your way down from chest/helm, to gloves, to bracers.)<br />
<br />
In this case, we opted for the design that offers more freedom to select the sources of Valor that most suit your preferred playstyle, goals, and available time. If you're into Mythic dungeons, then Mythic dungeons are going to be by far the most lucrative source of Valor, and should let you cover your needs quickly. But for players who don't want to run Mythic dungeons, queued alternatives (such as Heroics and Raid Finder) allow for a way to still earn Valor.<br />
<br />
I understand the sense of obligation to maximize performance in a competitive raid environment, but the game asks competitive raiders to make those choices constantly: do you craft every upgrade at the first opportunity, use the best gems in items you might replace soon, use the best food or Augment Runes on every pull, keep running lower difficulties on the off-chance of a Warforged/socketed perfect drop that could be an upgrade, keep up with multiple specs or alts to allow you to optimize for specific encounters, and so forth? <br />
<br />
Virtually everyone draws a line somehow and compromises in most of these areas, making a judgment about the point at which further expense (whether of gold, or time, or effort) is no longer worth the benefit. This system presents another one of those choices. The need to &quot;save players from themselves&quot; is a familiar refrain - but past experience has shown that people are better at managing their schedules and gameplay choices than many of the comments in this thread would suggest.<br />
<br />
And what about people like me whos preferred playstyle is to do organized Raiding? Why did you ignore the one question that's plastered all over this thread: why does Normal/Heroic/Mythic HFC not reward Valor?<br />
The focus of the patch is on dungeon content. Raid Finder was included as a source to add a few more options for Group Finder queuing, and if getting a few well-geared tanks and healers to hop back into Raid Finder improves queues a bit for the core Raid Finder audience, that's not the worst thing in the world. But if you hate Raid Finder, there are literally thousands of Valor available weekly without setting foot in Raid Finder. <br />
<br />
Part of the point is to provide a reason to revisit content that you may not have had much reason to do in a while, rather than just providing an extra reward for continuing your existing routine.<br />
<br />

WoW Panel Q&amp;A: Your Questions Wanted!<br />
During BlizzCon 2015, we’ll be hosting another World of Warcraft Q&amp;A panel on Saturday, November 7 where we’ll be answering as many Legion questions as we can. This year we’ll be not only collecting questions from those attending the show, but we also want to have questions from those of you who will be watching from home. To do this, we need your help and your questions. <br />
<br />
To submit your own question, simply post in this thread beginning today (Tuesday, October 20) through Thursday, October 22. We’ll compile these questions and present them again shortly after for you to vote on the ones you most want answered. Once the voting has ended, we’ll pull the top questions to present during the panel.<br />
<br />
Some things to consider when submitting a question:<br />
<br />
Please keep your question brief and to the point. These will need to fit on a large index card. With so many questions, we won’t be able to ask them all, but we’ll be doing the best we can. Make sure you’re asking a question versus making a statement. Please make sure the question is Legion specific. We won’t be asking general questions.<br />
<br />
Thank you to everyone who takes time to submit.<br />
<br />

no you dont have to do LFR, thats like worst idea ever but if you think its the best and fastest way for you - then i guess you deserve this punishment</div></div><hr />

<br />
They're not forcing you at all, they're giving you choices and options for how you want to progress your character. If you want to go hard and min/max the hell out of it, then thats your choice.<br />
<br />
I raid mythic too, but I wont be setting foot in LFR. Plenty of other avenues for getting valor, plenty of opportunity to get my important pieces upgraded ASAP by doing mythic dungeons and such, the time spent doing LFR isn't worth the reward for me. I mean, its not like anyone is racing for firsts anymore, is waiting an extra week to upgrade a few pieces of your gear really going to make or break things for you?</div></div><hr />

You act like the 20 raiders from your guild will all queue solo to do this.<br />

<br />
I don't get why they can't just add that &quot;seasonal&quot; cap they have with conquest? So if your valor caps at 1k/week and you only get 700 valor the first week, the second one you can get 1300 instead, going back to 1000 on week 3.<br />
<br />
I think it's an excellent system that holds people back like intended while at the same time not punishing them for maybe taking a break or not having enough time one week.</div></div><hr />

Or you can learn some self control and stop holding everyone who wants more back.<br />

<br />
Any serious raiding guild (as in, people who think it's fun to raid, but don't want to waste their time with slackers) will demand that their players get all the upgrades done at week 2, since you can have all 16 slots upgraded twice the week after this patch launches with 1800 valor to spare.<br />
<br />
Even if my raid group didn't demand it I'd do it anyway, because I'm a raider. It's what I do.</div></div><hr />

I am a dungeon player, but in order to progress further i am forced to do the cancer raiding...<br />

All the problems in this game start with the mentality that raider is something special and should be able to ignore the rest of the game, so blizz must make the rest of the game pointless and unrewarding..<br />

Yes, but it will only be a single week lock if you do all.<br />
<br />
It cost 8k valor to fully upgrade all your slots, and you can get 4,9k valor a week.</div></div><hr />

They didn't add a cap, it's the upper limit of what you could get in a week given the existing sources of Valor.<br />

Realistically nobody is going to do everything every week.</div></div><hr />

You don't force dungeons. You make them worth doing. The valor alone is going to make people resent them and act like toxic shitheads because of it.<br />

This isnt a raiding lobby game (but is very close to be, unless they wake up and turn around)<br />
<br />
Those two are not even remotely compareable. <br />
A raider will already have done all lfr bosses on a higher difficulty. There is literally no point in going back to easier content, except when Blizzard does things like this to get raiders to carry the people who can't do lfr themselves (these people actually exist, as hard as it is to belive).<br />
<br />
By making them go back, you are essentially punishing them for being good at the game. Which is kinda backwards.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, not giving dungeon players raid-level gear makes sense. The reason that is, is the fact that raiding is far more difficult and that they actually require said gear to complete.<br />
Dungeons are designed to be completeable for virtually everyone, even in questing gear. Thus you have no need for raid gear, at all. And if you only do dungeons, you will simply not earn said gear.<br />

They didn't add a cap, it's the upper limit of what you could get in a week given the existing sources of Valor.<br />
<br />
Realistically nobody is going to do everything every week.<br />
<br />
I think you mean &quot;Realistically, nobody except raiders is going to do everyting every week&quot;.<br />
<br />
As I've said before, you only need to clear everything two weeks in a row to have fully upgraded everything. The powergain is simply too immense and too quick for raiders to ignore it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Or, you know, you could make new content that people actually enjoy doing.<br />
<br />
Someone who is raiding has done these dungeons plenty of times already. Someone who is playing casual/solo/LFR also has done these dungeons plenty of times.<br />
The horrible thing about valor was that you were spamming the same old dungeons for a whole expansion long while being way too strong for them. And now you don't even have another option to gain valor, like dailies in MoP or raids. On top of that we get less and less dungeons every expansion so it becomes even more repetitive.<br />
<br />
Forcing players into way too easy and boring content is never good, never. They will just burn out on this content in no time just like they do on garisson/shipyard missions and LFR. But oh well, WoW has a &quot;cyclical nature&quot;...</div></div><hr />

Didn't see much crying when you could get a thousand badges in a week if you wanted in WotLK.<br />
<br />
How am I holding anyone back? The system is holding you back. You still can't get infinite valor there is an effective cap for how much you can aquire each week even if that number is no longer 1000. What I suggested would be a catch-up mechanic which is something that relieves pressure without changing anything for those who play 24/7.</div></div><hr />

I understand your reasoning, but with that logic, everything else besides raids, should not even offer a small reward, so the raider does not have to do it. Also there are many players in the game, that have the skill to do the raids, but they don't do them for various reasons...maybe they don't want to have a schedule, or maybe the don't find it fun?<br />
<br />
Besides, in TBC / WotLK / Cata you could get raid gear from dungeons (with badges/valor) and even get tier gear...The idea is that raider get it faster, while dungeon player get it slowly. Besides, this is an MMORPG with a virtual world and lot of content, is not a raiding lobby game.<br />
<br />
Just because the developer want to give non-raiders a way to advance their characters, does not mean that their intention was to make you carry them through content...as I said, there are veteran players, skilled players, who just cant get themeselves into raiding anymore, because they have been there and done that and don't like to do it anymore..</div></div><hr />

Forcing raiders there is seriously retarded idea. Thanks Blizz!<br />
<br />
You're not really a min-maxing mythic raider if you haven't cleared HFC mythic by the time this patch is released mate. You're simply a heroic raider who can kill some mythic bosses since the last raid always lasts a year+.;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Valor upgrades are good for everyone. Badge gear in TBC was only good to catch up or progress outside of raids and was inferior to gear that dropped from raids. There is quite a difference.<br />
I think I maybe only bought one item with badges in TBC. I really didn't need them as a raider and my guild didn't even progress fast, we were pretty much like normal/heroic raiders today.<br />
<br />
And if you are not raiding then why would you need raid gear? You can have slightly less powerful gear as rewards and still feel you are progressing your character.<br />
<br />
There is really no reason to constantly force players to grind old content like this if they don't want to. Except if you want to artificially keep them busy like smartphone games like Candy Crush do because they don't have any good and engaging content. Or to improve queue times... :S which is just a horrible reason.</div></div><hr />

That's not what he's saying. He's saying that it should also offer the rewards in normal/heroic/mythic raids. Can you imagine how annoying it must feel for a mythic raider that works hard to do hard bosses only to have blizz nudge them to go into LFR, where people really don't exert any kind of energy when it comes to the game?<br />
<br />
We worked hard, and are now nudged into the opposite direction. Besides it being insulting to a sizable chunk of the player base, it really shows those bright apes at blizzard are applying the LFR mentality to their own works and ideas, i.e. don't exert any kind of energy when it comes to the game.<br />

<br />
Only raiders need to see their characters growing stronger? Thats another false logic...I want to see my character grow stronger, I want to see the numbers of my abilities higher, I want to kill mobs even faster, I want to get new gear for vanity...<br />
<br />
Do you imply that you only see gear as a &quot;tool&quot; to progress further in raiding? Because I can say that you don't need mythic gear in order to complete mythic raid...you are supposed to get into mythic with heroic gear, so why do you need mythic gear? There is no other mode above mythic, to use the mythic gear as a &quot;tool&quot; for it..<br />

as I said, this is an MMO game with many activities..if anyone could just chose his favorite activity and get all rewards the game can offer there, I am up for it. I will chose leveling and dungeons, you can chose raiding, others may chose dailies, etc. <br />
<br />

Any serious raiding guild (as in, people who think it's fun to raid, but don't want to waste their time with slackers) will demand that their players get all the upgrades done at week 2, since you can have all 16 slots upgraded twice the week after this patch launches with 1800 valor to spare.<br />
<br />
Even if my raid group didn't demand it I'd do it anyway, because I'm a raider. It's what I do.<br />

<br />
<br />
This is exactly what I wanted. A reason to run 5man dungeons with my friends. Cause right now there is literally no reason to do it. I dinged a warrior to 100 over the weekend. First steps were to get the legendary quest, so I had to do like three dungeons or four. Blitzed through them. Then I unlocked Tanaan. With flying, just flew around picking up the good gear, and then just doing bonus objectives for Apex.<br />
<br />
With the absolute mountians of apex from alts, I sent over 7 Baleful tokens to upgrade gear from 650 - 695. My Warrior went from dinging 100, to like 685 ilvl in a few hours. Ridiculous. And none of it was via dungeons.<br />
<br />
While I'm a mythic raider, and will try minmax valor to upgrade my gear, I thoroughly will enjoy being able to run 5mans with my friends who don't mythic raid, and have an enjoyable and relevant experience with them with mythic and heroic dungeons. <br />
<br />
And its a bonus not HAVING to step foot into LFR, that utter piece of shit functionality<br />

<br />
While you might not like Mythic dungeons, there is a large demographic of players, who enjoy 5man content, and have been massively disappointed with WoD at how it made 5mans totally irrelevant so early into the launch of the expansion.<br />
<br />
That they introduced Mythic, and then introduced valor back to make dungeons a bit more relevant, is a positive step to restoring 5man content back and therefore a positive step to PvE.<br />

I'm a mythic raider, and I won't be stepping foot into LFR for valor. There was a brief discussion in the guild last night, and from it was a very much &quot;whatever way you want&quot;. I won't go near LFR unless I really have to. It's already a nightmare going through it for legendary catchup on alts.<br />
<br />
It's a terrible, utterly terrible function and experience. But anyone at mythic level that goes in there now to gain valor is doing so of their own accord. The ilvl increases are not required to kill bosses on HFC Mythic. If anything its a passive nerf to HFC, since characters will grow a little stronger. I'd be surprised if any mythic guild forces their players into LFR or puts time constraints on getting ilvl bumps, since its totally immaterial to HFC progress.<br />
<br />
So there is nothing being forced here. Clearly there is a demographic that like LFr(Who are these people?) and they can benefit to by gaining valor from that level of play, and bump their LFR gear or whatever they have. <br />
<br />
But this outcry that Blizz is forcing Mythic raiders into LFR is nonsense. If you do it, its totally of your own accord. Don't pretend like your being forced to do it, because LFR is no requirement for anything at Mythic level.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It cost 8k valor to fully upgrade all your slots, and you can get 4,9k valor a week.<br />
<br />
This. <br />
<br />
Also, I hate to break it to you, but if you're fussing about this being a competitive game changer...the mythic competition is long over. At this point you may have mythic kills, but they don't matter. It's months after release and guilds with fewer upgrades than you cleared the content weeks ago. Get over it.<br />
<br />
They might as well remove AotC, because they are in essence nerfing HFC by inflating item levels. <br />

Competition had nothing to do with this discussion. If you want to complain that you're forced to lfr top &quot;be competitive, &quot; It's over. You already lost. Retire until Legion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't give two shits what you feel, Blizzard on the other hand might want to, considering &gt;50% of their player base loathe LFR, and that same player base does not want to repeat the same content on a lower difficulty, it's like incentivizing you to play through a tutorial of the game again... only it's with people that have been playing it for months, and still haven't learned the basics. <br />
<br />
Also, the hard working raider is having fun working hard in... you guessed it, hard mode raids. He is not having fun carrying the load of people who simply don't care to try. The LFR community deserves its wipes and long queue times, mythic raiders being brought in to carry helps no one, especially the LFR players, who still refuse to try getting better or even dare trying to actually switch specs and tank because dungeon journal is too hard with all those squiggles n stuff.<br />
<br />
How would the community like it if LFR offered no loot, and only things like valor and you have to raid for nomarls+ for loot? LFR will now actually provides more resources than any other difficulty in the game.</div></div><hr />

I love idiot comments like this... The world race is over sure but server level races are still on going. There are different levels of competition - It doesn't stop with the world or even national race. Moreover ranks matter to people. Being able to say top X Number World/Nation is a competitive intensive. Especially when there are still less than 100 guilds that have killed Mythic Arch in the US. <br />
<br />
People here saying that guilds still progressing now are not Mythic/Competitive guilds are deluding themselves or trying to stroke their e-peen.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Mythic raiders, you should carry people&quot;<br />
&quot;LFR raiders, you keep doing you, in fact, you'll be getting some help soo&quot;.<br />
<br />
Forget your 715-725 main, most heroic/mythic raiders have 2-3 690-700 alts, and those too will be pushed through LFR for the easy 10 ilvl upgrade to get into grps far more readily, which is what I believe was the main intent behind this system since the xpac won't be out for at least 4-6 months.</div></div><hr />

A raider will already have done all lfr bosses on a higher difficulty. There is literally no point in going back to easier content, except when Blizzard does things like this to get raiders to carry the people who can't do lfr themselves (these people actually exist, as hard as it is to belive).<br />
<br />
By making them go back, you are essentially punishing them for being good at the game. Which is kinda backwards.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, not giving dungeon players raid-level gear makes sense. The reason that is, is the fact that raiding is far more difficult and that they actually require said gear to complete.<br />
Dungeons are designed to be completeable for virtually everyone, even in questing gear. Thus you have no need for raid gear, at all. And if you only do dungeons, you will simply not earn said gear.<br />

I think you mean &quot;Realistically, nobody except raiders is going to do everyting every week&quot;.<br />
<br />
As I've said before, you only need to clear everything two weeks in a row to have fully upgraded everything. The powergain is simply too immense and too quick for raiders to ignore it.<br />
<br />
About the gear from dungeons...I actually think the Mythic Warforged being able to be much higher ilvl is a great reward, although I do feel the potential of 725 is a bit too high, I think 710 would be a good final point. And honestly, I am beginning to wonder why they don't add normal tier to valor as well for the dungeon players. While tier is part of what makes everyone strong this tier, it's also the trinkets and in order to get the trinkets people should have to raid.</div></div><hr />

That said, I will not be going into LFR to get valour. I'll do the daily dungeon, probably a few mythic dungeons, and likely the non-pvp weekend events. I will not spent a dozen hours getting every scrap of valour I can get, whether or not my guild &quot;requires&quot; it.<br />
<br />
I am making a choice to forego potential item upgrades, at a point that for me and my raid group are the most important.<br />
<br />
Want to know why? Because the bosses we're progressing on now can be killed as is without any upgrades. The bosses are killable at probably 15 item levels lower than we already have, and we already outgear them. Getting a couple of items upgraded with valour does not stop someone standing in fire or messing up a personal responsibility mechanic that wipes the raid. Repetition and practice is where that comes from.<br />
<br />
As a mythic raider, this is very much a choice, and anyone that feels compelled to run LFR so they can raid mythic difficulty might want to look at other ways to improve their performance, above a 1% upgrade per item slot.<br />
<br />
Edit: On the other hand, I look forward to the day after the patch when all the posts here and on the forums are about mythic raiders ruining the dungeon and LFR experience by everything dying too quickly that people don't get to enjoy it. It'll be the new &quot;gogogogo&quot;</div></div><hr />

He's saying that it should also offer the rewards in normal/heroic/mythic raids. Can you imagine how annoying it must feel for a mythic raider that works hard to do hard bosses only to have blizz nudge them to go into LFR, where people really don't exert any kind of energy when it comes to the game?<br />
<br />
We worked hard, and are now nudged into the opposite direction. Besides it being insulting to a sizable chunk of the player base, it really shows those bright apes at blizzard are applying the LFR mentality to their own works and ideas, i.e. don't exert any kind of energy when it comes to the game.<br />
<br />
Hey blizz, you do realize this is your game and your player base that you are incrementally driving away, right?<br />
Jesus, whats the point in beating a dead horse? let's just hold hands and wait to drown in the slow sinking ship we call world of warcraft.<br />
Was fun while it was afloat though, gonna miss the good times.<br />
<br />
I know you're not quoting me, but mythic raiders don't have to do LFR....I personally am avoiding LFR on my main. Now that we know there is no cap I am only going to do the daily heroic, mythic dungeons, and weekly quest on my main. Actually I may do Highmaul and BRF(since they take about 20 minutes now), but I'm avoiding hellfire. So worst case is I miss 3 upgrades in a week and I'm okay with that. I will definitely say finding out there's no cap relieves me a bit. I don't &quot;have&quot; to do everything if I don't want to. If it takes me 3-4 weeks to max my gear I'm okay with that. As they said in their blue post, first 2000 valor is going to upgrade weapons and trinkets. After that the upgrades are more trivial(although still matter).<br />
<br />
My opinion though on not including normal/heroic/mythic with a once per poss valor reward still holds the same regardless. I still feel it should be included with the raids. If they're going to say it's a dungeon focus patch and we included LFR, because if raiders queue for it what harm is that....then what harm is it in giving it to raid bosses. We could essentially skip something we may not like doing since we'll get x valor from our weekly clear.<br />

<br />
i dont give a damn if you get same amount of vp from doing just dungeons.<br />
in fact i agree that we should be able to get the cap from doing what we enjoy to do.<br />
<br />
it boggles my mind that we wont get any vp from doing the hardest content in game.<br />
<br />
It boggles my mind for their reason to include LFR but not Normal and above. Oh it won't hurt anyone if geared raiders queue for LFR...really blizz...cause it'll hurt anyone by including it in our normal clear right?<br />

I leveled my mage to 100 and did heroic dungeons and got into several groups of insanely geared melee...it killed the fun and I got bored fast...I can ABSOLUTELY guarantee what you said, that I bolded, will happen.</div></div><hr />

Thats another false logic...I want to see my character grow stronger, I want to see the numbers of my abilities higher, I want to kill mobs even faster, I want to get new gear for vanity...<br />
<br />
Do you imply that you only see gear as a &quot;tool&quot; to progress further in raiding? Because I can say that you don't need mythic gear in order to complete mythic raid...you are supposed to get into mythic with heroic gear, so why do you need mythic gear? There is no other mode above mythic, to use the mythic gear as a &quot;tool&quot; for it..<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
That's a false equivalence and you know it. For one, mythic dungeons are nowhere near as hard as Mythic HFC and are easily doable by people in 695 (apexis) gear. Mythic HFC was done in heroic gear by Paragon and Method, the best of the best. Furthermore, having mythic raid gear does not trivialize the mythic raid content like mythic dungeon gear does for mythic dungeons.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ElDoorO</div><div class="date">2015-10-22, 02:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Valor upgrades are good for everyone. Badge gear in TBC was only good to catch up or progress outside of raids and was inferior to gear that dropped from raids. There is quite a difference.<br />
I think I maybe only bought one item with badges in TBC. I really didn't need them as a raider and my guild didn't even progress fast, we were pretty much like normal/heroic raiders today.<br />
<br />
And if you are not raiding then why would you need raid gear? You can have slightly less powerful gear as rewards and still feel you are progressing your character.<br />
<br />
There is really no reason to constantly force players to grind old content like this if they don't want to. Except if you want to artificially keep them busy like smartphone games like Candy Crush do because they don't have any good and engaging content. Or to improve queue times... :S which is just a horrible reason.<br />
<br />
If you're not racing then why do you need a sports car? It's a silly argument.<br />
<br />
To be honest though, I'm glad. Hopefully this will help combat the idiots who want 700+ iLvl for *Normal* mode HFC runs. Then again, I refuse to run with people that think you need a 700+ iLvl for normal. Usually means you're carrying them. The reality is you don't *need* the higher iLvl, you need to cheat mechanics because you can't do them. I've been in those guilds. They were PISSED I refused to carry them. I'm not going to over-gear raids because you refuse to do mechanics. My main guild was a tier ahead of them. I'm guessing you're the kind of GM in my off guild where you push for people to carry you instead of respecting mechanics.<br />
<br />
If you're a &quot;mythic&quot; raider and you haven't completed it yet.. I'm sorry but you're not a mythic raider.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You don't have to do it all though...it takes 8000 Valor to fully upgrade 16 slots(7500 if you have a 2H). if you skip LFR you lose 1275 valor for a week leaving you at 3600 valor for the week. If you're using a 2H you can skip LFR entirely and be upgraded in two weeks with minimal time in LFR...I'm not missing the point but we're not being forced into the cesspool that is LFR.<br />

Lol seriously - Where is the definition that says someone is a mythic raided only if they complete the Mythic content on some time table?<br />

Point and Fact you're a Mythic Raider if you've killing ANYTHING on mythic. You might not be a TOP 200 guild mythic raider (since only 191 guilds have killed Mythic Arch) but you're still a mythic raider. And as I said previously multiple races are still occurring. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">guardian_titan</div><div class="date">2015-10-22, 02:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Those complaining about LFR need to be open minded. Ever heard the statement &quot;be the change you want to see&quot;? You have options with LFR.<br />
1.) Don't run it (gasp! So creative!)<br />
2.) Run with your regular raid group (gasp! Blasphemy that I'm in a raiding guild and should queue for LFR with my like-minded guildmates who also want valor)<br />
3.) Rather than demean other players (which makes YOU the toxic one, not them), learn to be constructive and HELP others. Someone dies to something stupid like fire or a void zone and the group wipes, make a POLITE suggestion that that is why they died and to get out of it faster the next time. Also remember that lower graphic settings change the look of various graphics. On Xhul'horac, the swirls aren't visible on low settings so you're relying strictly on the &quot;beams of light&quot; that appear above the swirl to tell you there's one below you. Repeat the suggestion a second time if the group wipes again. If the group wipes a third time ... well, either the person or people you're talking to have chat turned off, they're not watching chat at all, they just don't care, or they don't speak your language. In that case, I'd just resort to kicking. If they're screwing up on purpose, they're either trolling the raid or just being lazy. Neither should be supported by the rest of the raid.<br />
- Also, do learn what POLITE means. Telling someone, &quot;WTF noob! Get your fucking ass out of the fire!&quot; does nothing to help. Something more like &quot;Hey, I saw you died in the fire last time. If you can't see it, perhaps you should turn your settings up a little so you can avoid it easier.&quot;<br />
<br />
People complain about toxic players in LFR, yet the only toxic players are those that post anti-LFR comments on these forums and the official ones. Blizzard can't fix that issue. That's on us, the players. If you want to punish toxic players, then get to it. Stop ignoring them. Run with enough friends so you can kick AFK players or the toxic players. If you notice someone purposefully slacking on DPS, kick them, too, but if a player is genuinely trying and just has crap gear or the wrong stats which is the cause of their low DPS, don't be a dick and kick them. Perhaps tell them they should look at getting gear with a certain stat or point them to a website NICELY on where they can learn more about their class.<br />
<br />
I've run LFR a LOT over the years. I've run it on various toons on both sides from healers to DPS (I do have my limits and won't tank it). I had 9 toons who ran it back in Dragon Soul, 2-4 that ran it in MoP, and I have 11 that run it now. The only toxic players I've ever run into are:<br />
1.) those that insist on posting damage meters and calling low DPS noobs<br />
2.) those that pull trash ahead of the tank which often causes us to wipe because we weren't expecting it<br />
3.) those that AFK because they feel entitled to do so because they feel better than everyone else, it's &quot;LFR&quot;, or because they really don't want to be there but still want to get gear or their legendary items.<br />
4.) those that purposefully cause an argument over something stupid (often after a wipe). Sometimes being quiet in LFR is better than starting an argument and ruining the enjoyment of the run.<br />
<br />
Quite often the toxic players are just like those on the forums (here and the official ones) that spout off random things that are anti-LFR. Remove those players and LFR is so much better. Begs the question if the players complaining about toxic players in LFR are in fact the toxic players themselves. I enjoy the runs where we don't get players who post damage meters, pull extra trash, AFK, and argue. Those runs are the easiest and nicest. But thanks to anti-LFR people who insist on causing trouble, many runs are often a nightmare. It's rare if I get a like-minded group that will kick a toxic player. Only time I've seen AFK people get kicked is if they repeatedly cause a boss to reset (like Hans'gar and Franzok in BRF) or we wipe and people look at damage meters to see they did nothing. If people kicked those who are a detriment to the group, then LFR would be considerably better. Yet people just deal with it rather than do anything about it. People's mentality need to change and need to adopt a no tolerance policy. Nothing will change unless the players themselves do it. Blizzard gave us LFR. We were the ones to make it what it is now. Blizzard didn't tell people they can AFK or be rude to others. The players did that. Expecting Blizzard to fix it is stupid.<br />
<br />
So honestly, please don't queue for LFR if you don't want to be there. It's people like you that cause it to be a cesspool anyway. Stick to the other sources such as mythic dungeons where you can decide who to bring and who to kick to the curb. The world first race is over. Many server firsts are also over. On those servers where server first is still an option, chances are your next closest competitor isn't much competition so 10 iLvL won't make that much of a difference between &quot;winning the race&quot; and losing. If you're not close to downing a certain boss now, 10 iLvLs won't matter much.<br />
<br />
Besides, if you're being forced to run LFR for valor by your guild, you know what that's called right? Peer pressure ... aka bullying. Learn to say no or leave the guild. If you don't want to do something, don't do it. I left a raiding guild in TBC because I got told to regear myself via PvP when I tried to change from resto to elemental on my shaman. They didn't want to spend the time to gear me despite the time and effort I put into the guild. I didn't want to do it again since I did that once before just to raid with my guild (yes, I raided in PvP gear back in TBC) so I looked for another guild and found one that was even better than the one I left and didn't require I regear myself. If there are no other guilds, then make one.<br />
<br />
If you're running LFR despite not wanting to but you're the one pressuring yourself, seek help from a therapist. You must be one of those people that go to a buffet and must eat everything because you have to get your money's worth and it's all right there. Learn self control and don't do things you don't want to do. It's people like you that causes Blizzard to make caps to begin with. Learn some self control and Blizzard can open things more giving us more options.</div></div><hr />

It is NOT okay that people that actually need the upgraded gear the most (i.e. people that are still progressing) will have to do content that they overgear by far to get those upgrades. (And sure, they might be bad or just suck but it doesn't change the fact that they want to progress and might not be able to do it without the extra help.)<br />

I really don't understand what purpose the LFG tool serves other than allowing current raiders the ability to be exclusive when forming PUGs. It only takes one bad experience for a would-be raider to write off the entire system. I'm sure there were many that were turned off of organized raiding as a whole because they were jacked around with overblown ilevel requirements and/or booted for whatever arbitrary reason. Everyone says &quot;If you don't like it, form your own raid,&quot; and I can say from personal experience that not all people are cut out to run organized raids. It takes a very specific personality and mindset to be able to pull it off, and most WOW players do not have said ability to do it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also I ran a guild that got server first Heroic Garrosh months before 6.0 - So I am not really sure where you get off making assumptions about my raiding prowess. Hell if you want to play that game I've got server first titles and achievements going back to wrath - Not sure how many folks are Death's Demise but I'd venture to say not many; but I'm not going to call everyone who doesn't they aren't good players. Beyond that - other stuff goes into raiding than just being good at mechanics; time being one that is pretty major.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I go with this option. I am not sure why people feel they are being forced to do the LFR. If you can't upgrade your gear with the rest of the option available to you to do so, then that is more a problem on you and not the LFR. This introducing valor back in the game is being used as just another carrot to get people to continue to run content they would otherwise not touch or have not touched in months. With no new content they have to keep the current stuff fresh by any means necessary. <br />
<br />
So for those whining about being raider and having to go back into the LFR to further dip into the well, so they don't feel some sort of artificial mean of getting behind in content is really only in their own minds and the minds of the people they raid with. In other words it just gives them something to endless bitch about in this game, as they seem to never ever stop bitching.<br />
<br />
Further more those bitching about the LFR, take your own raid group through the content to acquire the valor, if you don't want to run the content with people less desirable, stop whining, if the valor means that much to you then surely the entire raid group should be able to fly through the LFR in record time to round up all the valor available per week. At best you might have to do it for about 3 weeks, so that all your gear will then be upgraded.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No they didn't. They are trying to push everyone into dungeons and LFR. There are those of us like me who just log in to do dailies, pet battles, professions, etc. and don't mess with dungeons and LFR (or not very often anyway). So no, no they didn't.<br />
<br />
I know I will never have the best gear because I don't raid or dungeon crawl and the best I will have is Baleful and that's okay with me. But my playstyle is being left out in the cold with this &quot;design&quot;. I liked MoP because I could do dailies and stuff at my own pace and slowly improve my Timeless gear. With the way they are doing it now I wont even have the chance to do that.<br />

It only takes one bad experience for a would-be raider to write off the entire system. I'm sure there were many that were turned off of organized raiding as a whole because they were jacked around with overblown ilevel requirements and/or booted for whatever arbitrary reason. Everyone says &quot;If you don't like it, form your own raid,&quot; and I can say from personal experience that not all people are cut out to run organized raids. It takes a very specific personality and mindset to be able to pull it off, and most WOW players do not have said ability to do it.<br />
<br />
If you are on top of getting the gear you need, the group requirements are not that overblown. As long as you have a decent ilvl and not bad you should be fine. I don't doubt you can be booted over bullshit, or some requirements are overblown but lets not pretend this is as rampant as you say it is. If someone writes off the system from one bad experience, they probably shouldn't be raiding if they are going to give up so easily.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The system doesn't really work for low level progression groups, though. I cannot tell you how many times my guild needed a few people to fill out our Normal mode raids, and we can't get a single bite despite having low ilevel requirements (680 or something, can't remember off the top of my head). Either everyone just wants to be carried or wants a fast run with no hiccups at all. If you're not offering that, nobody is interested. It's worse than the days sitting in SW calling out for puggers on raid nights. At least then, we'd get a couple of green people wanting to wet their toes.</div></div><hr />

The world race is over sure but server level races are still on going. There are different levels of competition - It doesn't stop with the world or even national race. Moreover ranks matter to people. Being able to say top X Number World/Nation is a competitive intensive. Especially when there are still less than 100 guilds that have killed Mythic Arch in the US. <br />
<br />
People here saying that guilds still progressing now are not Mythic/Competitive guilds are deluding themselves or trying to stroke their e-peen.<br />

Nobody's going to be singing your praises for killing Archi after soft nerfs, man. People care about top 10 and after that if you kill mythic, good for you, you are the best of the 2nd best.

Wow literally this is one of the most elitest thing's I've ever read on here (ironic, given what I am about to rant on). I'd be just as qualified in saying you're a &quot;wannabe&quot; for getting anything less than world first Mythic Arch as you are for say this to people who haven't cleared M HFC yet to date. (Still waiting on that official definition of &quot;Mythic Raider&quot; your touting. I contend its just your opinion; which frankly only you care about.)<br />
<br />
Also I ran a guild that got server first...blah blah blah, titles nobody cares about months after release and significant nerfs...wow i was server first on some things yay...<br />
<br />
If you're so great, Kelyne, why haven't you downed mythic Archi? Why do you need the soft nerf of improved ilvls to do it?<br />

They aren't forcing you to cap your valor. Heck, just doing dungeons/quests you can max out your gear still relatively quickly.<br />
<br />
Why should Blizzard be forced to put a cap in because you lack the self control and discipline to say, &quot;Wow, I don't want to do this content, and I don't HAVE to, so I'm not going to!&quot;? (Hint: they shouldn't. Grow up.)<br />

They're not forcing you at all, they're giving you choices and options for how you want to progress your character. If you want to go hard and min/max the hell out of it, then thats your choice.<br />
<br />
I raid mythic too, but I wont be setting foot in LFR. Plenty of other avenues for getting valor, plenty of opportunity to get my important pieces upgraded ASAP by doing mythic dungeons and such, the time spent doing LFR isn't worth the reward for me. I mean, its not like anyone is racing for firsts anymore, is waiting an extra week to upgrade a few pieces of your gear really going to make or break things for you?<br />

<br />
I never said I needed item upgrades. I simply was addressing the comment that was being made that people who had not cleared mythic at this point were not mythic raiders. Also you are wrong about people caring after the top 10. If you read my previous posts there are still a lot of accomplishments to be had. Server Rankings in general among the largest of them. I hate to break it to you, but your personal opinion is not a reflection of reality. <br />
<br />
I don't see the Irony here. I am accusing the comments of &quot;e-peen-ery&quot; because the statements being made are effectively putting other players down with the &quot;You're a bad player if you haven't done at least what I have&quot; agreement. <br />
<br />
The underlying fact here is that there is still a lot of competition going on folks are going to feel obligated to take advantage of them. That is why people are complaining. Not that I agree with complaining either - but I don't think its fair to go out and say things like &quot;Stop complaining; its not like your progression matters.&quot; or &quot;You shouldn't min/max your not a mythic raider&quot; ect. It would be more fair to say &quot;Part of completing as a mythic raider to putting in additional time to get an edge and that time + skill determines your ranking&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
1) I don't particularly care for LFR, so I don't do it. I clear normal and I'm progressing through heroic (first 6 down) with a friends and family guild that, admittedly, is overwhelmingly mediocre. I've got nothing to hide, broh. And what is an &quot;LFR Hero,&quot; btw? I'd love to hear your totally fair and unbiased definition. I don't want things to be easier, I don't want them to be harder, I don't want mythic stuff handed to me. Is there any other stereotype I should pre-empt you on?<br />
<br />
2) I'm not trolling just because you disagree with me.<br />
<br />
3) Re: Kelyne,<br />
I can accept that you feel like server ranking is important. I personally don't, because I view servers as a poor metric of player population. Some are progressed, some aren't. A server first on a low pop server is, in theory, a better accomplishment than a high pop because you have a greater talent pool to access; except that it isn't, really. You'll always have the ability to move a team to a low pop and wipe the floor with it...and that's even prior to the inevitable crossrealming that will occur.<br />
<br />
What I disagree with, however, is that the idea that your server first kill of mythic Archimonde, with greater gear levels, will be any sort of fair metric to weigh your accomplishment by, especially against other mythic raiders who clear the content currently.<br />
<br />
4) Mythic players don't suck, I never said that, and I never will. I admire the skill and the dedication. What does suck is people who can't stand there being options for everybody else. What does suck is elitism, and it's the #1 reason these forums, in particular, are such a toxic place. See also, from a different thread about this same topic:<br />
<br />
Jeff Vogel, indie developer for 20+ years and creator of the (excellent) Exile/Avernum series of RPGs wrote a very interesting blog article (http://jeff-vogel.blogspot.com/2015/09/early-access-difficulty-fetishests-and.html) that touched on this this recently. An excerpt:<br />
<br />
&quot;There are lots of different ways you can get damaging feedback, but the Difficulty Fetishists are the ones you must fear the most. They are marked by three qualities:<br />
<br />
1. They ALWAYS want the game to be harder, no matter how hard it already is.<br />
2. They will be the loudest, most persistent givers of feedback. They will swarm forums, making them seem more numerous than they are.<br />
3. They are mean and contemptuous to anyone who suggests, no matter how meekly, that the game is too hard to be fun. (&quot;n00b!&quot; &quot;LRN 2 PLAY!&quot; &quot;GIT GUD!&quot;)<br />
<br />
Now let us be very clear. Gamers who love really hard games ARE a valid audience. I have several such gamers as permanent members of my testing pool, and they are invaluable when I design the harder difficulty levels. However, they MUST be kept away from influencing the default difficulty level at all costs.&quot;</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KrotosTheTank</div><div class="date">2015-10-22, 08:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I want to add to guardian_titan's post with something i had posted back when MC was released for the 10 yr in LFR form:<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;For those complaining about the LFR and the &quot;retards&quot; and how stupid it is, please take a step back. If we're all honest with ourselves, there is a time we can all remember not knowing what we're doing at all, for me for example that was Karazhan. Just because someone doesn't know how to play their character or isn't familiar with SoO (current raid tier here) for months like you doesn't mean they are retarded or stupid. They just don't know! New people subscribe all the time. I've met players who started the game for the first time in 2014, months after Siege. What are they met with? Guild's that won't take them if they want to raid since they aren't 560+ for FLEX and LFR groups full of people who all yell to &quot;kick the guy doing 40k dps, he must be a fucking idiot!&quot;. These LFR heroes do nothing productive. Same even goes for 5 mans.<br />
<br />
Those of us who know our characters and raid heroic content that occasionally go into LFR for whatever reason, helping a friend etc. should just take the extra second and explain the fight. I'm a tank, I do quite well at this and it does make it easy to control a raid. You guys have no idea how grateful these players are afterwards when you take the time to explain the fights on a basic level and walk them through it. Tanks auto get assist but ask for assist, help set up groups, a little goes a long way. I had a group in LFR one shot Garrosh and lose only ONE person to annihilates by simply explaining how to avoid them. Sure people got hit, but not often enough to just die to it. If people don't help them then how will they get better? &quot;good&quot; players seek out the help, you know there is always someone better than you, why not extend your helping hand to those who may be afraid to ask for help because they aren't in your guild, or on your server and are &quot;clearly retarded and can't play their class&quot;. <br />
<br />
I know this is a bit of a rant, but it just bothers the shit out of me. Seriously, it's amazing how many people are thankful for explaining things out instead of treating them like they are worthless shit. They are eager to be included and be a part of the raid rather than just some &quot;dead weight&quot; slowing your uptight ass down. They are grateful when you give them more than 10 sec for being afk, since you know, a lot of people who do LFR can't commit hours at a time, precisely why they are there and not in a traditional raid structure. Sure there are trolls, there are freeloaders, handle those as well, but I can promise if you are an &quot;LFR hero&quot; and you start shit talking the other members of any raid I am in, you better be pulling serious numbers to back yourself up, otherwise you're going to eat those words. <br />
<br />
&quot;Good&quot; players like us who can help carry a lot of weight in these runs. Instead of using it to be a dick, or snobby to the &quot;other 30 retards that aren't in my 10 man raid&quot; why don't you do your part and just help them do theirs.<br />
<br />
Ok end rant.&quot;<br />
<br />
The constant bashing of players who aren't able to match your level is insane. Hell it's even more clear since the post i quoted above with the new &quot;heroic&quot; raiders. They act like they are better than they ever were when the same level of content was labeled &quot;normal&quot;. How about you people either shut the fuck up with all this melodrama or do something about it:<br />
<br />
Did they go completely mental?! Is forcing you to do cancer LFR really that smart idea? I'm a raider, I progress mythic bosses but to min max, to do best dps, I must go back to all LFR wings and relive all the pain and horrors of wiping on Butcher or whatever boss people still cant do. Forcing raiders there is seriously retarded idea. Thanks Blizz!<br />
I've highlighted how miserable your life is and I am truly sorry for your loss. Just take the stick out of your ass and either don't do it, or do it with a more pay-it-forward mindset and help those people, those that are there and are trying will be more than appreciative.<br />

But seriously, your post is right on. The irony of the toxic community is that people cry out for the devs to do something about it, when in fact it's the community itself (equal parts laziness and elitism--when I see people with mythic kills admitting in other threads that they join LFR and afk, or when people in poor gear make no effort because &quot;what's the point I gotta get better gear anyway, carry me&quot; - both extremes) that must cure itself.<br />

<br />
Your scrub opinion doesn't matter to me. I'm still in the top 1% of people in this game. I chose to progress in this game while having a life outside of it. That's more important to me than getting a top 50 kill. <br />
<br />
Since you don't raid on mythic and have no clue how it works let me enlighten you. It takes practice. It takes time, it takes wipes. A world first guild will play this game 7 days a week 16 hours a day and wipe on a boss 300 times before they down it. Then you look at me. 11/13 mythic in a guild that raids 2 nights a week for 3 hours. Do you have any idea how long it will take us to have 300 wipes? So your asinine posts about us being shit because we didn't down it the first week are just that, asinine. There is no physical way for method to down Arch in 2 weeks if they raided 6 hours a week.</div></div><hr />

This. It's all that's needed. I'd rather see people just participate and silently stew or even just talk about random funny stuff in LFR chat that complaining and instantly pointing fingers at anything and everything. Of course explaining fights helps much more, but I get it, it's not everyone's cup of tea, and typing a million lines sucks. I just have to reiterate though, many of these people are very happy and appreciative to have someone explain it and to have someone have patience with them so that next time they can, and will, do better, albeit at their own pace.</div></div><hr />

That is a limit, not a cap. A cap would be if you could only earn 2k at a time or only hold 5k at a time, like with seals. They are saying that they are not artificially capping how much valor you can earn in a week. They could add a patch 6.2.6 that adds additional sources of valor which would raise the limit.</div></div><hr />

Your scrub opinion doesn't matter to me. I'm still in the top 1% of people in this game. I chose to progress in this game while having a life outside of it. That's more important to me than getting a top 50 kill. <br />
<br />
Since you don't raid on mythic and have no clue how it works let me enlighten you. It takes practice. It takes time, it takes wipes. A world first guild will play this game 7 days a week 16 hours a day and wipe on a boss 300 times before they down it. Then you look at me. 11/13 mythic in a guild that raids 2 nights a week for 3 hours. Do you have any idea how long it will take us to have 300 wipes? So your asinine posts about us being shit because we didn't down it the first week are just that, asinine. There is no physical way for method to down Arch in 2 weeks if they raided 6 hours a week.<br />
<br />
Ooookay buddy.<br />
<br />
1) I never told mythic raiders they suck. I went on to say the opposite. Thanks for not reading past the first line. But there is, philosophically and literally, a difference between getting an achievement when under-geared/geared at level, and getting the &quot;same&quot; achievement after content has been nerfed and weeks/months of farming. That doesn't mean you suck, that means your accomplishment is not as prestigious; and those are not the same statement.<br />
<br />
2) You realize you're only giving people ammo when you act like a jerk and then talk about being the top 1%? That's feeding into the stereotype that you were just fighting.<br />
<br />
3) I didn't say I'd never mythic raided. I said I'm currently raiding normal/heroic. That's more fun to me with friends and family and inclusiveness, even if it's, as you put it, &quot;scrub.&quot; Thanks for buying into that stereotype, too. <br />
<br />
4) I never said you were shit, so I have no idea where this insane vitriol is coming from. Welcome to ignore. I tried to engage in a dialogue and you're just flinging toxic poo at my face.<br />

This. It's all that's needed. I'd rather see people just participate and silently stew or even just talk about random funny stuff in LFR chat that complaining and instantly pointing fingers at anything and everything. Of course explaining fights helps much more, but I get it, it's not everyone's cup of tea, and typing a million lines sucks. I just have to reiterate though, many of these people are very happy and appreciative to have someone explain it and to have someone have patience with them so that next time they can, and will, do better, albeit at their own pace.<br />
<br />
I take the time to explain the fights. Sometimes people ignore that. Other times they don't, but they're AFK (regardless of how well geared they are). It happens. We might wipe, even in a fight with no enrage timer and literally 1/4th of the mechanics.<br />
<br />
Life goes on, you know? It was my choice to queue for LFR. I'm not going to rage over it. And I've made a lot of friends that way, by being NICE, which is to my mind way better than being skilled.<br />
<br />
THAT SAID...it's possible to be skilled AND nice. And people like that are awesome.</div></div><hr />

You never actually said the words &quot;mythic raiders suck&quot; but when you've made a few posts in this thread saying anyone not in method is wasting their time. That they're not as good and server races mean nothing. Not one mythic raiders thinks they're as prestigious as method. Nobody gives a shit about prestige or what other people think of them. They do it for the challenge, that's the fun for them. Implying they suck cause the race is over is toxic so you're a hypocrite. Especially so when you don't even run mythic and you're shitting on mythic raiders.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
Absolutely, that's what I'm saying.<br />
<br />
I mean come on, you'd seriously call the heroic/mythic SoO raiders that downed Garrosh after the WoD patch landed mythic raiders? If it takes you *that* long, you're not a mythic raider.<br />
<br />
Just we're only four months into this tier. There haven't been any substantial nerfs to Mythic either. So if that's what you're saying then you're not only delusion but an idiot as well.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zrankfappa</div><div class="date">2015-10-23, 10:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That is a limit, not a cap. A cap would be if you could only earn 2k at a time or only hold 5k at a time, like with seals. They are saying that they are not artificially capping how much valor you can earn in a week. They could add a patch 6.2.6 that adds additional sources of valor which would raise the limit.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q: What is the difference between a &quot;limit&quot; and a &quot;cap&quot;?<br />
<br />
A: With a &quot;limit&quot; you are forced to do content you hate to reach the &quot;cap&quot;.</div></div><hr />

To be fair, that's more an indictment of this forum than anything else...and, to take it a step further, of the same 5-ish people who post in every thread that has any mention of LFR. Then the same 5 people who always defend LFR go to that thread and argue, and occasionally other people get involved, but ultimately it does end up looking like there's this huge debate when, in fact, it's just the same ten people arguing the same arguments for no real purpose. I include myself in that, but I'm going to stop, because logic is useless.<br />
<br />
<br />
The one thing everybody can agree on was that WoD's endgame sucked because it lacked content outside of raids. Anything other than that starts wars. Were the raids good? *violent fighting* Was *x feature* an improvement? *violent fighting* Should flying/lfr exist? *violent fighting* So basically, we all agree that endgame was sorely lacking in non-raid things to do, but we can't agree on what else there should be, and any time Blizzard even so much as proposes something we're all biting each others' heads off, when we should be celebrating that there might actually be a choice before Legion.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
LFR/dungeons giving valor (thus rewarding hardcores for participating in lesser content) is the &quot;blue shell&quot; of the comic.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aelric70</div><div class="date">2015-10-23, 01:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Given that the people really good at raiding have already finished with far less gear and certainly no valor upgrades, only the wannabe's like yourself would resent having to go into LFR or other avenues to get the crutch you need to finish. Save your indignation for when you are actually worthy of it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Those two are not even remotely compareable. <br />
A raider will already have done all lfr bosses on a higher difficulty. There is literally no point in going back to easier content, except when Blizzard does things like this to get raiders to carry the people who can't do lfr themselves (these people actually exist, as hard as it is to belive).<br />
<br />
By making them go back, you are essentially punishing them for being good at the game. Which is kinda backwards.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, not giving dungeon players raid-level gear makes sense. The reason that is, is the fact that raiding is far more difficult and that they actually require said gear to complete.<br />
Dungeons are designed to be completeable for virtually everyone, even in questing gear. Thus you have no need for raid gear, at all. And if you only do dungeons, you will simply not earn said gear.<br />

I think you mean &quot;Realistically, nobody except raiders is going to do everyting every week&quot;.<br />
<br />
As I've said before, you only need to clear everything two weeks in a row to have fully upgraded everything. The powergain is simply too immense and too quick for raiders to ignore it.</div></div><hr />

Erm yes they are. &quot;Hellfire Citadel items, Dungeon loot, Baleful items, and crafted profession items can each be upgraded twice, for a total of +10 item levels&quot;.</div></div><hr />
