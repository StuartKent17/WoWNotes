In my previous post I listed the updated Valor Points Rewards, today we'll take a look at what we can get from the daily quests area of the Firelands. The vendors can be accessed after completing the very long questlines in the Molten Front, see the Mark of the World Tree article on Wowpedia (http://www.wowpedia.org/Mark_of_the_World_Tree) (the new daily quests currency, just like the Champion's Seals (http://www.wowpedia.org/Champion%27s_Seal) of the Argent Tournament.<br />
<br />
Basically, after unlocking all phases of the Firelands Dailies you will eventually gain access to 3 NPCs. You will need 125 more Marks of the World Tree to unlock each NPC and finally gain access to his/her inventory!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Filling the Moonwell (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/29279/filling-the-moonwell/) - Secure sacred water for the moonwell from Matoclaw at the Sanctuary of Malorne in Mount Hyjal. (Obtain 125 Marks of the World Tree.)<br />
Calling the Ancients (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/29283/calling-the-ancients/) - Secure the aid of the Ancients from Elderlimb at the Sanctuary of Malorne in Mount Hyjal. (Obtain 125 Marks of the World Tree.)<br />
Additional Armaments (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/29281/additional-armaments/) - Seek out Matoclaw at the Sanctuary of Malorne in Mount Hyjal. (Obtain 125 Marks of the World Tree.)<br />
<br />
<br />
The good news is that after you've unlocked the quests, you won't need marks anymore and items sold from the merchants are paid with gold. (Thanks to ChaosStorm for his forum post (http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/910655-PTR-4.2-Fireland-Daily-Rewards))<br />

At it's fullest after completing one of the 150 quests it's around 15 to 16 dailies which is about 28 marks give or take a couple. To complete everything it's around 400 dailies. I need 50 marks for the flaming hippogryyph mount on ptr :)</div></div><hr />

ok forget the word faction then, considering every NPC is a druid in the daily hub it seems odd that there is no druid gear...<br />

<br />
Basically yeah. These are progression for players doing heroics and questing, not for raiders. It is exactly the same as the epics you could buy at the argent tournament... No raiders were looking at those weapons licking their lips. By the time you can get these rewards, most guilds will have 4 or 5 weeks of Firelands raiding done. <br />
<br />
Blizzard would never give BIS, or even top iLevel items from daily quests. These are items that are meant for progression for players who are not raiding. It´s kinda like the reverse argument when you see people saying ´why do casuals need tier items if they aren´t raiding´.. the answer here is ´why do raiders think they can get BIS raid items from questing´. <br />
<br />
These are items that will be used to augment the new VP gear and to give none raiders further gear progression. Remember, most players do not raid... this is their progrssion.</div></div><hr />

Good news is - there is no reason to do that mindless grind of 400 dailes then - woot!<br />
<br />
Seriously Blizz, yet another Tol Barad style incredibly boring grind for marks. 'tis getting really old and nothing to even remotely inspire continued playing?<br />

A zone of dailies was a fresh and exciting idea when Isle of Quale'Danas and the Netherwing popped up back in TBC, Since then that concept has been overused (and more poorly implemented) and it no longer is enough to entice people to keep playing. Surely there is some other way to add content (aside from the obligatory but unimpressive 7-boss raid) that will actually feel fun?</div></div><hr />

<br />
because, it mmo-champion that classiffy the gear on this website<br />
<br />
and for all the healer/dps that complain about no spirit or hit on there gear, by giving an item with 2 secondary stat that are &quot;usefull&quot; for every role.<br />
So the dps who need more hit can reforge &quot;Widow's Clutches&quot; for hit and the heal can reforge for spirit. This way blizz only need to put one piece of gear for many role instead of creating one piece for every special snowflake</div></div><hr />

Actually the term Witch-Hunter is entirely fantastic and has been portrayed in many videogames, movies, and literature. Also, I don't think Blizzard is trying to be political with this item, and I think you are looking far too critical at an item in a fantasy videogame.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Plate Melee Waist = Guardians of Hyal<br />
Plate Spell DPS Waist = Wildhammer / Dragonmaw<br />
Plate Spell Spirit Hands = Earthen Ring (no spirit)<br />
Plate Tank Wrist = Ramkahen<br />
Mail Spell DPS Feet = Earthen Ring (spirit)<br />

Cloth Spell DPS Hands = Earthen Ring<br />

Mail Physical DPS Feet = Guardians of Hyal<br />
Leather Physical DPS Hands = Wildhammer / Dragonmaw<br />
3 rings for plate wearers (2xDPS, 1xtank) are not covered.<br />
<br />
So anybody, who has grinded out the old factions (and who doesn't?) won't get great upgrades in these slots. Of course anybody gets trinkets, relics and recipes. But it seems that Blizzard doesn't want anybody to gear up mostly through reputation.</div></div><hr />

LOL you're a riot.. let me guess, one of those self proclaimed &quot;witches&quot; aka new age hippies?

125 each.<br />
<br />
In total its 695 as you need to collect 300 for the shadow wardens and Druids of talon and 20 at the start.<br />

These are progression for players doing heroics and questing, not for raiders. It is exactly the same as the epics you could buy at the argent tournament... No raiders were looking at those weapons licking their lips. By the time you can get these rewards, most guilds will have 4 or 5 weeks of Firelands raiding done. <br />
<br />
Blizzard would never give BIS, or even top iLevel items from daily quests. These are items that are meant for progression for players who are not raiding. It´s kinda like the reverse argument when you see people saying ´why do casuals need tier items if they aren´t raiding´.. the answer here is ´why do raiders think they can get BIS raid items from questing´. <br />
<br />
These are items that will be used to augment the new VP gear and to give none raiders further gear progression. Remember, most players do not raid... this is their progrssion.<br />
<br />
Well, as far as doing normal raids count as raiding, these items are not justified to be as is whatsoever. <br />
<br />
Surely I'm butthurt at a disc MS holy OS priest seeing the ilvl365 items without a single point of spirit. Just like when I saw the lame tailoring epic legs without spirit either. Ye I know, reforge, still not remotely the same.<br />
<br />
However, are you suggesting that casuals don't need spirit or hit? :D Guess that shouldn't be that way... then again, I have to grind all these dailies for some mounts vanity pets or recipes etc etc? Awesome motivation right there. <br />
<br />
Imo, these items should be well itemized, with stats between somewhere under the tier 12 items - a good boost for the early raids.</div></div><hr />

You need to earn 695 marks in total, which if I calculate correctly will take you somewhere between 48 and 56 days. Nice two months of grinding :)<br />

This depends on the combo of dailies you get each day. They arent always the same and some give 2 and some only give one.<br />

Souds &quot;awe-inspiring&quot;. It's only probably really worth to do the grind till all BS recipes on a BS char. There is some profit in these weapons. Otherwise it's a timesink for the sake of timesink.<br />

<br />
Giving you a mount for 60* days of grinding the same quests is not really an adequate reward, or well it's accepted in WoW for whatever reason. After having 120+ mounts already I could't give a shit about one additional mount for which I have to endure repeating quests. <br />
<br />
If the quests would be different it's a different story, which could be easily done, but instead of questing for one week i.e. 7 or 14 days of fresh quests each day, they decided people should die a little each of those 60* days doing the same quests over and over. <br />
<br />
I'll do them, but asap as I unlock everything this shit daily zone wont see me again like with all the previous daily zones and daily quests in general. I do not know if non-raiders enjoy the game by doing the same quests over and over for a year or two, but I guess they don't so forcing everyone in a 60* day long grind is kinda missed.</div></div><hr />

No, they do not require hit, or even the spirit beyond what they can get from other pieces or can reforge these pieces to. Remember, their mana pools will be going up drastically with this gear, as will their crit, which makes healing more efficient. There is also that big change coming where heal crits are at 200% now. I think you are applying rules for progressive raiding that do not apply to the people this gear is intended for. We will be getting this gear many weeks after 4.2 hits, which means most players will have a few pieces of 378 bought with VP, will probably have every piece of 359 bought with JP.... that type if ilvl will put you absurdly over the gear needed to heal troll heroics and T11. My main healer is also Disc, and I fully expect to be doing mostly smite-healing in the troll heroics, similar to what I am doing now in the normal heroics when I go for satchels.</div></div><hr />

so basically anyone who has raided or done arena has no need for these items already.<br />
<br />
anyone who hasn't can get equivalent items in a week of farming heroics, faster than farming gated dailies for a month rofl rofl rofl<br />
<br />
blizzard are so dumb it's ridiculous sometimes<br />
<br />
by the way this place is gank city on the PTR pity no one will go there on live except for badly geared noobs and far better geared world pvp starved arena players who will camp the living daylights out of them<br />

Yup you're completely correct.<br />
Blizzard still has time to tune down the collection rates of the Marks so that this grind will take 4 months.<br />

After having 120+ mounts already I could't give a shit about one additional mount for which I have to endure repeating quests. <br />
<br />
If the quests would be different it's a different story, which could be easily done, but instead of questing for one week i.e. 7 or 14 days of fresh quests each day, they decided people should die a little each of those 60* days doing the same quests over and over. <br />
<br />
I'll do them, but asap as I unlock everything this shit daily zone wont see me again like with all the previous daily zones and daily quests in general. I do not know if non-raiders enjoy the game by doing the same quests over and over for a year or two, but I guess they don't so forcing everyone in a 60* day long grind is kinda missed.<br />
<br />
Hear that sound?<br />
That's the sound of $30 (assuming people are 'diligent' and don't skip quests/days) going into the bank - paid to Blizzard for something which, in the end, players can't stand to do anymore.<br />
<br />
I'm actually curious how in the hell the suits who came up with this brilliant master-plan couldn't see how much this is probably going to backfire on them (most people I know never touched TB after they got their rep, and it's be the dame here). Taking 2 months + to grind something out is NOT the issue - it's the cheap repetitive mindless of it. At least, it's hard for me to imagine that even WoW's general population gets a thrill out of the daily repeat system.</div></div><hr />

I'll be finished the Molten Front Offensive tomorrow (695 marks) so will know myself then if there is anything additional afterwards that would require marks. If there isnt then if current gold for items hits live there is no need to keep gathering marks afterward.

<br />
I don't hate quests in fact, I think leveling in each expansion is a lot of fun. Even daily quests are fun for the 5th time around. But when you are forced to do the same quests 10, 20, 50 times and then receive a finger up your arse for wasting your time and brain cells for 60 days, then there's something wrong. <br />
<br />
Competitive people want to get shit done, so I will endure the grind to unlock everything this game has to offer as I did this far. And yes you are right I dislike the game more and more and if it weren't for my guild and the raid nights with them, I would have quit quite a while ago. <br />
<br />
This all daily zone is a stall by Blizzard to buy themselves more time for new content. It's been half a year since Cataclysm was released and no new content what so ever, let's not forget that Cataclysm launched with abysmal little content for level 85 players to begin with. So yeah, they are neglecting both the raiders and non-raiders, one raid instance (which seem quite short) + a grind zone is not enough really after 6 months. <br />
<br />
So this takes me 60 days to complete, not because I'm not dedicating enough time, but because the quests are gated and limited per day, so all in a while somewhere in August 2011, Blizzard can come and proclaim that people still have fun with the Firelands daily zone so the content is still fresh .... eeeer wrong, the content is stale as piss at that point, it's just so, that people still do it to get it done, and because they get the same quests every day, they just can't endure the pain of doing it every day, so what is in essence a 60 day bad grind, becomes a 90+ day boredom of hell where you ask yourself each day, &quot;do I really want to do the Firelands daily quests today, or just go vacuum the house and wait for the raid?&quot; and guess what most of the time wins for me.</div></div><hr />

So you're not happy with Fireland's aswell as the dailies, or, you're not happy with 4.2 at all? You only play because of the friendship you have in your guild? That doesn't raise alarm bells for you personally at all that the game is not worth paying for anymore? If/when I grasp the same opinion as you the game will be dropped for me. Probably when would be the best term as it's inevitable for everyone I guess. I'm not one of those &quot;you don't like it don't play it&quot; kinda people that tells everyone else they should quit the game everytime they have a negative opinion on something. I just havent seen you be positive about it apart from the community aspect in your guild. Although I love playing with most of the people in my guild I would still quit if new content just didnt cut it for me anymore.<br />

Anyway what you do is entirely up to yourself but you could really do with some cheering up with something you enjoy ingame :o<br />

<br />
I am disappointed in the latest expansion pack as a whole. As mentioned in my previous post, there was lack of content for end-level players from the get go, the 6 months drought wasn't helping either (let's assume that 4.2 is going to hit soon) refurbished ZG/ZA didn't do much either. As a patch 4.2 is fine, I fear though that the next raid after that is going to take them another half a year and yes, one raid instance for 6 months was not enough before and is not enough now, especially looking at what I just wrote above. <br />
<br />
I also think, note - think not claim, a lot of people feel the same as I do, from what is heard inside the game on chats and so. <br />
<br />
Also; Yes friendship inside the game has some value for me and it is what keeps me playing lately, I can spare 13EUR per month I can spare a lot more, I also invested a lot in my characters so yes in a way it points to addiction when I try to drag myself to unsubscribe, but once done I have no problem to live without Warcraft as I did many times when the game got stale, while waiting for patches - that said, the game was never so stale so soon as Cataclysm.<br />
<br />
For the daily zone; I guess people have different opinions. For me doing the same quest more times is a chore and not something I would label as fun. I do pretty much the same thing at work every day, as most people, so I don't want to fall into that routine inside a game too, where I &quot;should&quot; have fun. If they can design 100 quests for this patch, I bet they could design 5 quests/week and patch the game with new quests frequently. That way, I could look forward to do new daily quests each Wednesday and get the grind done with fresh stuff. Those quests could easily be added to the total pool, so guys like you who don't mind doing them over and over again, could do them each day from the point of implementation if they desire.</div></div><hr />

Tol Barad can be a total chore on a PvE servers as well if you get 3 kills quests 10+ each and the server is highly populated it will take you a long time to complete them. Most people don't or cant group up (not that you can do that with the other faction anyway).<br />

<br />
I generally enjoyed getting to exalted doing TB dailies, but without a good reward at the end of it I probably would have only done it for ~2 weeks (and focused more on the PvP than actually doing the quests). I'm trying to slog my alts through TB, but my enthusiasm has waned greatly.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm not saying these dailies have completely changed my attitude towards the game or reinvigorated my desire to play the game as I've been/I am suffering from the same state of mind as you (with regards raid content) and as you so rightly said so many others. yes the game is pretty bad atm. I'm not one to lvl characters at all and I've suddenly found myself lvling a druid from 0-51 in around a day. Maybe its anxious over waiting exam results I dunno. The game is dull I agree but in comparison to some of the older dailies pushed onto live in TB/Argent tournament these dailies are alot more enjoyable than them. Yes they suffer from the exact same repetitiveness as the 2 mentioned but they arent entirely the same set of dailies everyday. You can choose between doing the shadow wardens quests one day and the druids of the talons quest the next day. However after a few weeks they both do tend to get a bit of that dull factor.<br />
<br />
I think what caught me by surprise and was possibly the factor in me doing these dailies everyday since PTR opened was that it felt like a development of the zone, and it was me who was developing it. I guess that is probably the biggest pull factor for doing the dailies aside from the rewards at the end.<br />
<br />
I'm glad you gave a nice decent response, usually I get attacked when/if I ever am Pro blizzard (in a sense).<br />

<br />
If it is really smaller or as small as tol barad (the daily zone) then I am going to cry.<br />
<br />
Molten Front is smaller than Tol Barad but you'll also have dailies to do in Mount Hyjal aswell. I also entered several times into Molten Front with about 90 or so people (give or take a few) thus making it very overcrowded before and didnt have a problem completing my dailies. Sure it was a small amount slower but you can tag mobs without being grouped so both or everyone gets credit.</div></div><hr />
