as a Sub rogue - I needed a nerf, not really worried about what they did though. If you didn't have trinket up I was going to kill you with two dances + mark in about 5 seconds, it'll probably take around 15 now.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">korijenkins</div><div class="date">2018-09-06, 10:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">They fundamentally misunderstand whats wrong with these classes. Sure, you can nerf their damage and that can be a bandaid fix, but Rogue is too strong because its kit is too strong. Having a rogue pop evasion and cloak on you as a DK and trinket your hard stun is still going to be a thing. You're still going to have to stand there and fap for 5 seconds unable to do ANYTHING at all to the rogue. You can pop AMS and mitigate the pathetically small amount of damage poisons do against an Assassination rogue, or maybe the dot from Sub, but Outlaw will still light you up. Is IBF useful? No. Why? because you need your trinket for a potential blind/incap and thus have to IBF the full kidney/between the eyes, otherwise you'll be eating 6 seconds of pure free damage into 5 seconds of being unable to do any damage. If you don't trinket blind/incap, the rogue will run away and restealth, getting another opener for free, basically making the fight over before it began. Maybe I'm looking too much into this, but these are bandaid fixes to classes and PvP that need major changes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The sub nerfs were huge. Evis and SS are combined ~50% of our damage. The Phantom Assassin nerf is a 25% damage reduction by itself, and the Evis and SS nerf is another 20% of our damage (and an even bigger reduction in burst). Evis and SS changes were really unncessary and pretty much kill Sub in PvP now outside of very specialized comps where they just set up kills and somebody else (Mage) does the damage.<br />
<br />
The azerite trait was clearly broken, and toning down Phantom Assassin is reasonable, but the spec shouldn't have been completely trashed like that.</div></div><hr />

Evis and SS changes were really unncessary and pretty much kill Sub in PvP now outside of very specialized comps where they just set up kills and somebody else (Mage) does the damage.<br />

The azerite trait was clearly broken, and toning down Phantom Assassin is reasonable, but the spec shouldn't have been completely trashed like that.<br />

&quot;these rogue nerfs aren't that bad, i was thinking deadly brew or mutilate might get the nerf, but they seem to have worked around it with taming dots as opposed to direct damage which is nice. &quot;<br />

nice try~~ outlaw rogue dont deserve to PVP. <br />
u should cut between the eye damage to 1 HP per shot. <br />
Outlaw rogue totally have 4 regular skill for making damage and 1 speaci UTI. <br />
now u just nerf 3 of them. un-believed-able!!!<br />
<br />
Since WLK, the PVP is dead.<br />
since that, 80% season winners/gladiators comes from Glitch and Gold Farmer Studio(yes, they also have the business of this)<br />
that's contribute from:<br />
1. u keep buff Mage/DK/Shaman in most of patch.<br />
2. healer is too OP and impossible to kill. u want to kill a healer, u need to chase him 20mins and u CAN NOT MAKE A SINGLE PROBLEM.<br />
if u just make a tiny problem, then u will never kill him.<br />
<br />
glad to see this news, and i am happy to give up the whole season -- as always -- hand it to Gold Farmer Studio -- again!<br />
and i am happy to tell you -- have a nice day -_-.</div></div><hr />

Yea, hunters are mid tier, just because a raid that has very movement heavy fights makes us top pick and lets us FINALLY shine..That doesn't mean we're not mid tier. People are just getting their jollies in a bunch because hunters are finally shining.. if your class was doing well because the raid mechanics were better for your spec/class, you wouldnt even be talking about hunters.</div></div><hr />

Good god — did some arenas on sub after the nerf and Disc priests are putting out as much damage as I am, burst tickles, and warriors are doubling my damage. I swear they are just making stuff up with some of these numbers. Sub rogue burst is down 50% (ignoring broken azerite trait stacking). That's not tuning, that's just breaking stuff. Less than 1 week for them to screw us and it won't be fixed now until next season.</div></div><hr />

Right? That's not &quot;optimal for mechanics&quot; that's overtuned, and given the ease of BM all around, come on...<br />

You know that these were PVP Hotfixes? Your wierd day 1 Heroic parses are PVE. They have no place here.<br />
<br />
Plus you didn't even provide a number next to these parses.<br />

How many parses of Fury Warrior do you have there? 10 ? Because I don't think anyone would actually take a fury warrior with them.</div></div><hr />

BM isnt top pvp on 3v3 or 5v5 or Rbgs. Where it really metter.<br />
<br />
Yeah, 1v1 BM is beast. But 1v1 never meter on this game. If meter they need to nerf rogues to the ground since they can lock you kill if they want. <br />
<br />
And about BM pvp dmg, is ppl blind or what??? every new raid first week, normaly the most movile class is top.<br />

If you say BM hunter isn't one of the top speccs for 3s right now, then you are clearly blind. Before the rogue you still saw a few other comps, but right now there isn't a single arena above 2k where 1 side doesn't have a bm hunter or a warrior and most of the time both.<br />
<br />
Go to arenatracker.com and check the last 100 games<br />
<br />
There you can also see that out of the 100 last games above 2k, there were atleast 50 warriors or bm hunters.</div></div><hr />

Sub Rogues have lost Shiv, Gouge, and Garrote. All we have is stun, a 2 min Blind, and Sap out of combat. We're still good for CC, but Sub Rogue also has absolutely no sustained, so outside of burst windows, we do nothing. We need to have that burst to land a kill during a CC chain.<br />
<br />
I was doing arenas yesterday and even against terrible players who were trinketing the first sap and putting together 16+ second CC chains and bursting everything (including a 3 min cooldown) into a target was not even coming close to landing a kill. Disc Priests were coming very close to doing the same amount of damage as me, and Warriors and BM Hunters were easily doubling my damage.<br />
<br />
I skipped Legion, but I'm 350 iLvL, so above most, and was 2-2.1k all WoD in 2s, 3s and RBGs.<br />
<br />
Sub Rogue is completely unviable in arena now. Pikaboo, one of the top glad rogues who is a 3k player, has said the same (he already switched from Sub to Sin).<br />
<br />
I know players love seeing other classes get nerfed, but let's just agree things should be balanced? I intentionally skipped playing the first day of Arena and RBGs because I was waiting for Azerite traits to be fixed (I refused to take advantage of the clearly broken traits for Rogues). Instead I see the 1st line of hotfixes come in and my spec is instead now completely unviable. Really not fun.<br />

Burst? Only with wings up, just kite the paladin. Survivability? Kite the paladin until bubble wears off. Ranged attacks? I guess ret excels at ranged with their 1 judgment on a 10+ second cd. Utility? Sure, you got that one thing right.<br />

Glad Pally here, only targets I can't stick to are hunters and frost mages, anything else that can get away I just let them get away and swap to a closer target lol<br />

Sure, you got that one thing right (Indeed, Ret have the worst utilities in WoW. They're immune to root + sprint, bubble, heals, aoe heals, range stun with the shortest CD in game, etc... are definitely the worst utilities eve).<br />
<br />
Okay, let me give it a try too.<br />
<br />
Rogue burst? Just use your defensives or kite.<br />
Survivability? Kite the rogue until evasion wears off.<br />
Control? Just trinket the longest stun and the only stuns they'll do is 2s + 1s.<br />
Utility? Yeah, just like Ret, rogues have absolutely zero utility.<br />
<br />
See how stupid that sounds. Don't believe for a second it's different with your post.</div></div><hr />

Twice a week since release they've been nerfing us. Rogues are squishy as hell without cooldowns and are complete glass canons; Kill fast or die. Fuck Rogues I guess.<br />

Guess I'm PvPing as my Disc Priest this expansion.<br />

Paladins have heavy armor, 5 times the armor as Rogues, and can soak damage well without cooldowns.</div></div><hr />
