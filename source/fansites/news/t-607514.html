<br />
Every classes raiding spec can be boiled down to AT MOST 3 buttons pressed during raid to achieve max threat / dps / etc. Certain fights may make you press 2-3 more buttons, but raiding by an large is easymode... its relying on the other 24 noobs to have the same opinion that kills ya</div></div><hr />

<br />
Umm, you're terrible if you &quot;tab&quot; target raid members to heal. Can you even do that?<br />
Also you have a totem macro? lol. Most classes just spam things. I enjoy playing it because of the result fo my effective healing. Sure it's not fun to spam a button but thats pretty much what most classes do. I mean 0/21/40 locks just spam Shadow bolt if they are shadow destro, it's still fun to see big numbers. Regardless if they are fun or not, they are the best raid healers in the game and the most in demand healing class for tier 6+ raiding guilds.</div></div><hr />

Then there's totems, watershield, earthshield, positioning and the occasional interrupt.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying its hard, i'm just saying its more than 3 buttons.</div></div><hr />

you rarely if ever need to use your direct heals, and if you are...you are wasting mana in a 25 man raid</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mazorp</div><div class="date">2008-05-08, 08:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">these videos are crap. why do they have to add some crappy music to every video and disable the ingame sounds ._. movies like these are a lot cooler to watch when you can actually hear the new voice actors and other sounds for example. i for one will never enter that instance so i will never hear anything from there either.<br />
<br />
<br />
Because what you'd hear is their Ventrilo and not the in game sound. I personally never game with WoWs music on or with the voices, I have he in game sounds just slightly up because it can give useful information. Otherwise, it's Vent and nothing else.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xpace</div><div class="date">2008-05-08, 10:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Resto Shamans are the most effective end-game healers. Some might argue CoH Priests, but I personally find Totems plus Bloodlusts/Heroisms a lot more of an asset than what a 15-yard CoH can dish out. Shadow Priests can Mass Dispel and throw Fort/Shadow Resistance. <br />
<br />
SK-Gaming's line up is definitely optimal for raids, a good balance. Although I'd swap out one Hunter for another Rogue, but I haven't been to M'uru so it might not be a melee-friendly fight.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Izichial</div><div class="date">2008-05-08, 10:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;insanely hard fight&quot;. I wonder what is meant by that? hard for co-ordination, healing?<br />
<br />
<br />
A phrase I coined a while back that has gained some notoriety in the local hardcore raiding community is that &quot;once I'd have said that Archimonde was unforgiving&quot;, meaning that people dying at Archimonde triggering the random orb effects is nothing compared to how quickly and surely you wipe if a single mistake is made on some later bosses. <br />
<br />
M'uru is the hardest of these, by far. It's not just one, or two or three people that can instantly wipe the raid with a mistake, it's like 15, and tricky parts pop up several times a minute, and you have to hold out for a good while enduring the onslaught of adds until you can finally tip M'uru over to ph2/Entropius phase. Similarly, it's not just co-ordination, or just healing that is the hard part, it's pretty much everything.<br />
<br />
So basically, it's a fantastic fight! A lot of the Naxx fights we're hard to to retarded things like praying for no dc's at Thaddius, or number of geared tanks at 4H, but quite a lot of us have missed a fight we really have to chew at to beat.<br />
