I think he is either referring to the pathfinder achievement mount (which frankly makes sense for it to be a flying mount) or the various Blizzard store mounts during WoD... which were, of course, all flying mounts.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The problem is that MoP and WoD dungeons/raids don't have the legacy content super buff they had to put in for old content after the first major squish. I figure that implementing that for those raids wasn't top of their list in beta, and a week or 2 into the pre-patch being live they'll push it out quickly when people can't do MoP and WoD raids as easily and the shit storm really hits the fan for the live players.</div></div><hr />

I don't remember a mount that you couldn't use until flying was put in. I'm curious to know what mount that was in which they did &quot;exactly&quot; that with.<br />
I think it was a collector's edition mount called the [Pedantic Crow].</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thats pretty subjective... Out of my group of friends, the majority of us LOATHED SoTA, and honestly Silvershard and Gilneas are two of my favorite BGs.</div></div><hr />

I figure that implementing that for those raids wasn't top of their list in beta, and a week or 2 into the pre-patch being live they'll push it out quickly when people can't do MoP and WoD raids as easily and the shit storm really hits the fan for the live players.<br />
<br />
This makes sense indeed. Look at what happened when 7.3.5 came and made raids harder. it was hotfixed rather fast.</div></div><hr />

It really is a no brainier if you already do 6 months blocks. So that would be around 77 usd. It will be interesting to see what the bundle item is and what it offers for repeat customers. (I didn't regret annual pass one bit)<br />
<br />
i bet you right now that its gonna be virtual blizzcon ticket not a discount :) and blizzcon ticket will probably come with mount and pet + other bonuses in other games</div></div><hr />

Yeah, whenever i made a thread about legacy content Being affected like this, i kept being told “theyll fix it” or “its unintentional”<br />
Well look where we are now xd</div></div><hr />

<br />
Pop one for this month and then either use the rest for bnet credits to get the 6 month block or hang on to the remaining and use when your game time is about to expire.<br />
<br />
Well, with BFA right around the corner, and their inevitable rise, 203 wasn't too bad of a deal I suppose. Thankfully I have plenty of gold, I moreso just find it funny that hte one time I buy in bulk, there seems to be a new token on the horizon.</div></div><hr />

BFA is a flop and I'm calling this now.<br />
<br />
Dev's needed more time on the xpac but instead of getting it they are launching a month early.<br />
<br />
BfA feels like a real patch for Legion with a Gilneas fell rather than a new expansion. It makes you wonder why you waited for this crap when all it is is new dungeons to do mythic + on and just another 10 levels to grind.<br />
<br />
Blizzard took the same crew and the previous 2 expansions and just phoned in another expansion for 2 more years of the same shit we just had for over 2 years.<br />
<br />
I'm not a fanboy but I'm a fan of real content and here I am with almost every mount, toy and everything else there is to do in this game because they failed for another expansion to add anything real to the game.</div></div><hr />

You can only have 10 tokens at any given time. You can only have a max of $350 on your battle.net account. It's very hard to predict how the token price will look half a year from now. Will the price go up will it go down, nobody really knows and at most you can guess or speculate. That's why for some people it might be the best idea to just buy as much as possible in one go rather than &quot;hoping&quot; for a brighter future.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And like i said, use them 1 month at a time instead of popping all 10 at once.<br />
<br />
If you feel the need to use all 10 then get a bnet balance with it instead of wow game time. Bnet balance doesnt get used up like wow game time if you take a few months off and ive seen people get 1 year of time with tokens to play maybe 2 months.<br />
<br />
They wasted 10 tokens when they could have had $150 bnet balance.</div></div><hr />
