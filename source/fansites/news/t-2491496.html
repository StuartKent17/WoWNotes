8.1 had a fair bit of content though, not enough t o last this long, but if 8.2 came out a month ago it would be fine.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But I can't help but compare them to the old meta gems, like: Thundering Skyfire Diamond (https://www.wowdb.com/items/32410-thundering-skyfire-diamond).<br />
So if we had newer versions of those + the new punch cards, it would be amazing.</div></div><hr />

I wouldn't say they are inventive. Like you pointed out, they are the original gem system stuffed into an item. The entire gem system should still be this way.</div></div><hr />

i dont think we have ever had gems that deal damage, increase breatrhing, allow you to hack mechs, allow you to loot extra items... etc.<br />
salso meta were 1 gem, and you required a certin amount of other colours.<br />
these are 3 slots, with just color requires.</div></div><hr />
