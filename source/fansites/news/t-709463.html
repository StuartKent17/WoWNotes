http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/24x24/paladin.jpg Cataclysm Class Preview: Paladin (Paladin Forum (http://www.mmo-champion.com/class-paladin/))<br />
In World of Warcraft: Cataclysm we’ll be making several changes to class talents and abilities across the board. While this list only outlines some of our plans for the paladin class, we want to give you a look at the new high-level abilities and an overview of how the new Mastery system will work with each talent spec.<br />
<br />
New Paladin Spells<br />
<br />
Blinding Shield (level 81): Causes damage and blinds all nearby targets. This effect might end up only damaging those facing the paladin’s shield, in a manner similar to Eadric the Pure's ability Radiance in Trial of the Champion. The Holy tree will have a talent to increase the damage and critical strike chance, while the Protection tree will have a talent to make this spell instant cast. 2-second base cast time. Requires a shield.<br />
<br />
Healing Hands (level 83): Healing Hands is a new healing spell. The paladin radiates heals from him or herself, almost like a Healing Stream Totem. It has a short range, but a long enough duration that the paladin can cast other heals while Healing Hands remains active. 15-second cooldown. 6-second duration.<br />
<br />
Guardian of Ancient Kings (level 85): Summons a temporary guardian that looks like a winged creature of light armed with a sword. The visual is similar to that of the Resurrection spell used by the paladin in Warcraft III. The guardian has a different effect depending on the talent spec of the paladin. For Holy paladins, the guardian heals the most wounded ally in the area. For Protection paladins, the guardian absorbs some incoming damage. For Retribution paladins, it damages an enemy, similar to the death knight Gargoyle or the Nibelung staff. 3-minute cooldown. 30-second duration (this might vary depending on which guardian appears).<br />
<br />
Next you will find a list of some of the paladin spell and ability changes, followed by our intentions for improving each talent tree for the release of Cataclysm. There will be further changes, but those revealed below should offer some insight into our goals.<br />
<br />
<br />
Changes to Abilities and Mechanics<br />
<br />
Crusader Strike will be a core ability for all paladins, gained at level 1. We think the paladin leveling experience is hurt by not having an instant attack. Retribution will be getting a new talent in its place that either modifies Crusader Strike or replaces it completely.<br />
<br />
Cleanse is being rebalanced to work with the new dispel system. It will dispel defensive magic (debuffs on friendly targets), diseases, and poisons.<br />
<br />
Blessing of Might will provide the benefit of Wisdom as well. If you have two paladins in your group, one will do Kings on everyone and the other will do Might on everyone. There should be much less need, and ideally no need, to provide specific buffs to specific classes.<br />
<br />
Holy Shock will be a core healing spell available to all paladins.<br />
<br />
<br />
New Talents and Talent Changes<br />
<br />
We want to ease off the defensive capabilities of Retribution and Holy paladins slightly. We think the powerful paladin defenses have been one of the things holding Retribution paladins back, especially in Arenas. One change we’re considering is lowering Divine Shield’s duration by a couple of seconds. Having said that, Retribution does pretty well in Battlegrounds, and Battlegrounds will be a much bigger focus in Cataclysm since they can provide the best PvP rewards. Furthermore, the healing environment of Cataclysm is going to be different such that a paladin may not be able to fully heal themselves during the duration of Divine Shield to begin with, so this may not be a problem.<br />
<br />
We feel Retribution paladins need one more mechanic which involves some risk of the player pushing the wrong button, making the rotation a bit less forgiving. In addition, we want to add to this spec more PvP utility. Right now the successes of the Retribution paladin in PvP seem to be reduced to either doing decent burst damage, or just being good at staying alive.<br />
<br />
We want to increase the duration of Sacred Shield to 30 minutes and keep the limit to one target. The intention is that the paladin can use it on their main healing target. That said, we would like to improve the Holy paladin toolbox and niche so that they don’t feel quite like the obvious choice for tank healing while perceived as a weak group healer.<br />
<br />
We want to add to the Holy tree a nice big heal to correspond with Greater Heal. Flash of Light remains the expensive, fast heal and Holy Light is the go-to heal that has average efficiency and throughput. Beacon of Light will be changed to work with Flash of Light. We like the ability, but want paladins to use it intelligently and not be constantly healing for twice as much.<br />
<br />
Holy paladins will use spirit as their mana regeneration stat.<br />
<br />
Protection paladins need a different rotation between single-target and multi-target tanking. Likewise, we're looking to add the necessity to use an additional cooldown in each rotation.<br />
<br />
Holy Shield will no longer have charges. It will be designed to improve block chance while active, and will continue to provide a small amount of damage and threat.<br />
<br />
<br />
Mastery Passive Talent Tree Bonuses<br />
<br />
Holy<br />
Healing<br />
Meditation<br />
Critical Healing Effect<br />
<br />
Meditation: This is the spirit-to-mana conversion that the priest, druid, and shaman healers also share.<br />
<br />
Critical Healing Effect: When the paladin gets a crit on a heal, it will heal for more.<br />
<br />
Protection<br />
Damage Reduction<br />
Vengeance<br />
Block Amount<br />
<br />
Vengeance: This is the damage-received-to-attack-power conversion that all tanks share.<br />
<br />
Block Amount: We want to keep the kit of the paladin as a tank who blocks a lot. So by contrast, the warrior tank will sometimes get critical blocks, but the paladin will absorb more damage with normal blocks.<br />
<br />
Retribution<br />
Melee Damage<br />
Melee Critical Damage<br />
Holy Damage<br />
<br />
Holy Damage: Any attack that does Holy damage will have its damage increased.<br />
<br />
This concludes this Cataclysm preview for the paladin class. The development of these changes will continue to evolve in the coming months. Please be sure to provide any feedback and thoughts you might have on what was covered here.<br />
<br />
[...]<br />
<br />
Here's a bit more clarification on some of these changes. Also, please keep in mind that this is merely a preview and we'll still have more to go in testing up to and including any other changes that aren't listed here in the preview.<br />
<br />
We've updated the Flash of Light reference to make it a bit more clear in the original post as follows.<br />
<br />
Flash of Light remains a fast heal, but will be more expensive to justify the cast speed. Holy Light will be the go-to heal that has average efficiency and throughput. Beacon of Light needs to be changed so that its benefit is letting the paladin heal two targets at once, not letting the paladin get two heals for the mana cost of one. It’s intended to save GCDs and targeting time, not mana.<br />
<br />
In addition we’re changing the paladin heal design to match that of the other healers. Holy Light is the middle heal. It’s very efficient, but not particularly fast and doesn’t have a lot of throughput. Flash of Light will be the faster heal that costs more mana. (Currently paladins sort of flip the model around by having a fast, efficient heal.) Holy paladins can talent into an additional heal that is like a giant Holy Light. It might take three of these big heals (or two crits) to get a tank from death’s door back to 100% health.<br />
<br />
Currently on live, Beacon of Light is a tool that allows paladins to target more than just the main tank. In Cataclysm if it just doubles their healing, it is going to be overpowered. We have two ways we might handle this and we’ll experiment to see which feels better. The first is that Beacon only works on some heals, such as Flash of Light or Holy Light (but not the big one). An alternative idea is that Beacon increases the mana cost of a heal cast on a beaconed target, since you’re essentially getting a double heal. Under this model, Beacon itself would cost no mana.<br />
<br />
Also on the live realms currently, paladins have huge mana pools and massive throughput. The trade-off is that they are excellent single target healers and much weaker in other roles. We want paladins to be slightly more interchangeable with other healers. In Cataclysm, you should be able to have a Holy priest on the tank and a Holy paladin on the raid. We’re not sure we’ll back off of the current healing roles completely, but we definitely want to add more breadth to those whose roles are currently too narrow.<br />
<br />
As for the Guardian of Ancient Kings. First, it's important to understand that this is not a pet nor does it have a pet bar associated with it. Second, it's also not meant to last for very long. So, it's not a pet in the traditional sense. It's a friend in need when you need it, but not a permanent companion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
First of all, your name is &quot;the tauren rogue&quot;, making all your opinions null and void.<br />
<br />
Secondly, Blizzard/GC's job is to provide the changes they think is necessary for the game, as opposed to what the players ask for, which would usually just make their own class ridiculously overpowered.<br />
<br />
And where exactly is the so-called &quot;cast time Arcane explosion&quot; mentioned? If you're referring to &quot;Blinding Shield&quot;, that requires a shield, and thus will only be viable for Holy and Prot. Also, if you re-read the preview, you'll notice they once again stated that Ret needs more offensive tools, and less defensive ones. <br />

Well they'll be changing Crusader strike or improving it(Since it's a base ability now)<br />

Also you get Holy Shock:P Andddd as always they said that's not everything...<br />
<br />
<br />
My opinion on the radiating heals. Make it a buff that you activate, and for the next 6 seconds all healing you do is put into a buff on you, and 6 seconds afterwords you pulse out that much in healing again, but aoe. WIN!</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
From what i understand :<br />
They boost holy dmg so our Exorcism, consecration and judgement will it higher AND we get Holy shock (that do around same dmg than exorcism)<br />
<br />
That not the best change but if they really boost these its a nice buff, no new spell sharing consecration (so still useless in pvp) but some good boost + a pet</div></div><hr />

This effect might end up only damaging those facing the paladin’s shield, in a manner similar to Eadric the Pure's ability Radiance in Trial of the Champion. The Holy tree will have a talent to increase the damage and critical strike chance, while the Protection tree will have a talent to make this spell instant cast. 2-second base cast time. Requires a shield.<br />
<br />
Well, I was expecting at the very least an interupt or gap closer, and then they put this in as an 81 move, what about from 1-81? I know lower content means nothing to most but it sucks enough leveling and being kited non stop as it is, Also, requires a shield? WTF? Wow, the wait was for nothin' &gt;.&gt;<br />

Original Beacon of Light was pretty much that and they -nerfed it to the ground- for a reason. <br />
<br />
This is similar, but there is no way it will be as OP, which means it will probably be pretty lackluster.<br />
<br />
<br />
If it's original Beacon of Light, there might be a glimmer of hope on the horizon, but I really, honestly, cannot see that happening. They've put a few old, OP things back in (Heroic Leap is the big one coming to mind) but they've all been slightly changed/nerfed. <br />
<br />
This will be too most likely.<br />
<br />
<br />

PREVIEW<br />
LIMITED PREVIEW even<br />
<br />
More stuff is coming when the beta starts and even more stuff during the beta phase. They said they weren't sure how they were going to handle paladins yet. (Class changing is easy in WoW btw, adding numbers and using existing mechanics only uses time to decide, not to code.)<br />
<br />
We KNOW that all paladin trees will get changed and &quot;fun&quot; talents (aka ones you use and not passive crap) will be added. So probably you'll get some form of holy jump or lasso of light in the end. Just exercise some patience and don't assume stuff. (you know what they say of the word assume)</div></div><hr />

Definitely like the new spells and a few of the minor changes. The change to Beacon is an interesting one. And a good one I think, Spamming Holy Light with BoL up all night long wasn't very fun for very long (easy mode healing is easy).

<br />
Having crusader strike in the rotation to fill some gaps and also having a pet who absorbs dmg is very very good in my way of seeing things.<br />
<br />
the mastery could be better, but i dont see it as a bad thing, one way or another we will still be pwning in terms of avoidance and dmg mitigation.<br />
<br />
i dont know in terms of threat how will things turn out, but with vengeance beeing add, i dont think anything bad could come from this changes at all.<br />
<br />
Holy shock as a core spell is also a plus!!! and i cant say it otherwise, cause it will be good to have one &quot;big&quot; instant heal as a prot paladin, and who knows, maybe can be squeezed into the rotation now and then ^^ , cause at the moment it's just a bit boring to be tanking and waiting for all the CD's, now we have 2 more buttons to smash instead of 6 lol.<br />
<br />
all in one, i'm looking forward to try this out in cataclysm and before that, on the beta test.<br />
<br />
i hope you all got what u wished for, as for me, everything is alright.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They want to lower Holy Paladin overhealing, yet they gave them a mastery bonus that ramps up their crits.<br />
<br />
They want to take away the go-to-tank status that Protection Paladins have in ICC, yet they gave them a stronger mastery bonus than the Protection Warrior*.<br />
<br />
They want to lower Retribution's burst damage while raising utility, yet they gave them a flat damage increase on the armor-bypassing Holy damage that has been such a balance issue for them in the past.<br />
<br />
I'm looking forward to seeing how Blizzard and their adjustments to the rest of the game overall make Paladins work in Cataclysm.<br />
<br />
*Block Amount will provide a consistently higher damage reduction than Critical Clock, so I assume that with the (proposed and intended) change in the nature of the game from a GCD race to a tug-of-war that Block Amount will be the more popular mastery, especially among people who naturally gravitate towards consistency like myself. This is opinion and may be entirely incorrect since we don't know exactly how often Critical Block will activate or how much the total amount blocked will be.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It is still possible they will give us the utility that we need. Although I doubt it. Solving the issues we have been trying to tell them about for like ages should have been the first thing to design. Not adding pets or more holy spells.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Tank is ok - Single and Multimobskills ... I like that, something to do next to 9-6-9 but for the heal changes...<br />
<br />
I play a shaman as main and played the other healclasses to some decent level ... and paladin is the worst of all. I actually have to attack something to gain a speed buff? Theres something wrong with it, I'm a healer ffs.<br />
<br />
The Shield changes are nice but the HL/Beacon ... sucks. And if it's right FoL will use more mana, heal more, HL will heal better but maybe with lesser mana? And there will be an IMBA Healspell doing a fuckload of hp ... mhhh...<br />
<br />
Dunno what to think about that.<br />
<br />
But the thing I like the least ... the &quot;AoE&quot; skill -come one - only those next to you? Nice! does that mean I have to camp with the melee? &lt;&lt;<br />
<br />
Why not something like the trauma procc? Skill on one target, 2 sec timer ticks &gt; ding &gt; all alround the target get an aoe heal/hot whatever ...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Definitely like the new spells and a few of the minor changes. The change to Beacon is an interesting one. And a good one I think, Spamming Holy Light with BoL up all night long wasn't very fun for very long (easy mode healing is easy). Sounds like a bit more variety regarding healing style, and that's definitely appreciated.<br />
<br />
<br />
This isn't variety. We'll be doing the same thing except instead of HL we'll be spamming FoL, and instead of Int we'll be stacking SP.<br />
Basically we'll be forced to heal like Premontions paladins *shudder*</div></div><hr />

We feel Retribution paladins need one more mechanic which involves some risk of the player pushing the wrong button, making the rotation a bit less forgiving. In addition, we want to add to this spec more PvP utility. Right now the successes of the Retribution paladin in PvP seem to be reduced to either doing decent burst damage, or just being good at staying alive.<br />

Totems need some tweaks, there's not much decision making outside of spec/raid comp at all, much like pally buffs, but it's so much less of a sacrifice to give up HS or Stoneskin vs say, Might. <br />

I can already predict people using equip shield /cast Blinding Shield macro's.<br />

<br />
And this is bad? I'm perfectly fine of having to swap to shield just to use a blind abiltiy even though it will have less than a 2 sec cast (that's if it gets affected by haste thus reducing it's cd slightly.<br />
<br />
Maybe... Just maybe people will realize that it takes more skill to play? Hell I had to swap to shield and healing weapon in TBC just to get off a holy light and switch back. The extra healing from those two alone could have made the difference between a bad or good heal which could have saved you. Every little bit counts. If I have to swap shield in to be that much more affective then I'll do it.</div></div><hr />

that's the thing m8, blizz is probably still working on that, we dont know iet, this was mainly a preview, much much more is coming to the paladin class and other classes aswell. we are still far far away from the expansion, and there is still the beta test. probably some things will be buffed, others nerfed, others added and others removed.</div></div><hr />

Its fairly obvious that they're unwilling to announce a gap closer or an interrupt until they have a better feel for how we'll play in Battlegrounds (in which we do better than arenas, but thats arguably due to less resilience)</div></div><hr />

I also really like how they want paladins to be the &quot;block tank&quot; like they were in BC. I loved that style of play, it was awesome so I am glad to see they are bringing it back, even though its not excatly the same. Love the radiance spell idea.<br />

Don't like: Holy shock being a base healing spell. I wish blizz would stop moving this more and more and more towards a healing spell and return to the days of it being a damage spell or ar least an equal damage and healing spell so we forsaken shockadins can play how we want. All it takes is one instant cast spell for holy that hits like exorcism or return judgement of righteousness to its former glory. No huge changes needed.<br />
<br />
Bubble nerf? Again? by now just remove the damn thing it boggles the mind that for 4 years it was totally fine and in the year of wrath it keeps getting nerfed over and over.<br />
<br />
I am really not a fan of Might also providing wisdom. This takes away yet another blessing. Yes paladin blessings are hard to balance but at the end of the day having many different blessings is part of paladin utility. Now raids have an excuse not to bring more paladins. It makes us all the same and takes away the benefit of a holy pally having improved wis, ret having imp might, etc and the class in general having lots of buffs for the raid.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also sorry that you didn't get that distance closer or interrupt that you were QQ'ing for. But it's time to be honest with yourselves. With the amount of shere burst dps that a retadin can do, they needed a distance closer about as much as Garrosh Hellscream needs more roid rage.<br />

They're working on the classes one at a time, and Paladins are the one the last on their list at the moment, as they see them as being in a pretty damn good place right now, with all 3 specs being raid viable and at least 2 I know of doing well in Arena.<br />
<br />
Further, the listed changes actually address some of the most common concerns. No, my pally won't be getting a closer, but I don't want him to be a warrior with less phys damage and holy damage thrown on top. Sure having no closer sucks for PVP, and even some PVE encounters, but played properly, you don't need one. With the other changes I can see Paladins remaining firmly in the realm of solid raid/pvper.<br />
<br />
Also, base 2 second cast, it's quite likely that blinding shield will be affected by haste.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Maybe... Just maybe people will realize that it takes more skill to play? Hell I had to swap to shield and healing weapon in TBC just to get off a holy light and switch back. The extra healing from those two alone could have made the difference between a bad or good heal which could have saved you. Every little bit counts. If I have to swap shield in to be that much more affective then I'll do it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Except all you have to do is turn around or los to completely avoid this 2 sec cast and then the pallie is useless for another global while he switches back to a 2h. Once again it buffed prots cc/silence chain which it did not need at all.</div></div><hr />

Not really, they mentioned it will be a base healing spell, shockadin has been dead because they nerfed judgement of righteousness damage, not any healing ability. <br />

It requires some thought on positioning, just like healing rain from shamans needs you to predict movement. That's more than the current 'stand in holy light range and spam spam spam'.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gallahadd</div><div class="date">2010-04-14, 02:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not bad changes, the AoE blind (with a dash of damage) sounds good, with prot able to lower the cast to instant, seems sorta like our version of shockwave, allowing us to 'stun' a large group of mobs inside our conc for long enough to get a decent chunk of agro on them, which is just dandy. Then you have the AoE heal, unsure about that, I'll have to wait a see things like raduis, and amount healed before I comment more. Summoning an Angel to help? sure, why the hell not, further DR on a short CD could be good if used intellegently.<br />
<br />
one part though does raise flags, and that is the prot masteries.<br />
<br />
okay so we get DR, and Vengeance, those seem to be pretty much standard for all tanks, but then we get block value, compared to warriors Crit Block. Now I don't wanna sound like a whiner (because overall I liked the preview) but depending on values, this could be seriously underwhelming in comparison to Crit Block, but tbh that all depends on the values. For example if we get 10% increased block at all times and warriors have say... 25/35% chance to block double that's fine, but if its 5% increased block value (as I kind think it will be) compared to Crit block as it is now, 60% chance to block double, that will be...really quite bad, but I guess time will tell on that count.<br />
<br />
So all of that, combined with Holy Shock and Crusader Strike baseline, Might/Wisdom merged and mention of more to come, overall I'd say I approve of the changes.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard's idea of making healing more challenging is to nerf regen, thus forcing us to micro-manage our mana pools and restrict the number of expensive heals we can cast in a short period of time (that goes for all healing classes).</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
I do infact have complete faith in blizzard , THEY made the game you've been playing and so far it's been great. Nerfing &amp; buffing classes is only because of balance issues , remember how zomgwtfoverpowered was ret at 3.0 (i mean the wotlk pre patch with the wotlk talents back in tbc) ? I wouldn't call that a nerf (even though all those skills were not meant to be used at 70 , it was still too much).<br />
<br />
Also i main a priest and as you might know it's a pet class , or should be according to you... Yes i am talking about shadowfiend (which actually is a controllable pet) , lasts half the duration of your zomgskylazors summon who might not be controllable.... Last but not least i don't know why anyone wouldn't like a pet by his side... it's more dmg/heal/utility(from pet skills).... certainly it can't be bad.</div></div><hr />

Another thing I would like to see is that ret pallies should be able to spec into holy shock to make it an interrupt, much like wind shear. With their loss of cleanse in arenas, and their need for an interrupt in PvE to provide raid utitlity this would be a good solution.<br />
<br />
The last thing I would like to see changed is the faceroll prot mechanics. I would like to see mana become an issue, much like rage starvation, so you dont just use the same rotation all the time. Especially now that prot with have something on scale with heroic strike to improve single target threat, I dont want prot to be even more faceroll.

Yeah I know this too but it still does not change the fact that the ability can still be used. Not everyone will be completely LOSing. Let me put it this way. It's just another thing people need to watch out for. <br />

<br />
Instead of giving Paladins a fun and interesting new healing ability like Healing Rain they gave us a boring fire and forget short range AoE. All it will do is cause us to move around slightly more than we have been. It won't require skill, forethought or planning, it will just force us to get into the danger zone of where people are taking damage - a place we really shouldn't be. Shamans get an AoE they can place down in the danger zone, and keep themselves safely out of harms way. Feels like we got the shaft, in terms of fun and in terms of usefulness.</div></div><hr />

he is a holy fighter by himself god damn.<br />

Did Arthas need a pet when he wiped out all the citizens?<br />

He just killed them with one hand while reading the newest Hooters.<br />

The visual is similar to that of the Resurrection spell used by the paladin in Warcraft III. The guardian has a different effect depending on the talent spec of the paladin. For Holy paladins, the guardian heals the most wounded ally in the area. For Protection paladins, the guardian absorbs some incoming damage. For Retribution paladins, it damages an enemy, similar to the death knight Gargoyle or the Nibelung staff. 3-minute cooldown. 30-second duration (this might vary depending on which guardian appears)<br />
<br />
Can someone tell me what this looked like?<br />
<br />
<br />
Like a little angel guy in armor hovering down and slowly swinging his sword then flying back up as beams of light came down and hit the units being rezed...<br />
<br />
But yeah... That ability looks pretty cool... It's the first temporary pet that is awesome for all specs... And thank goodness Blinding Shield is for prot only...</div></div><hr />

<br />
But that was easily the worst preview.. Nothing was clear.. nothing came off as well thought out.. the whole &quot;some one had to be last&quot; line .. to me .. is now clear to be garbage. We were last because they dont like paladins and dont really care.. they know we will play any way. After all.. paladins have been the most well represented class through HORRIBLE stretches of nerfed ness.<br />
<br />
A 30 second pet that you cant control is utter garbage. I dont want mindless robat pet. I cant imagine any one else wanting that either.. its just like the gimicky procs on old weapons that NO ONE ever used.<br />
<br />
3 new abilites.. you would assume that the 3 new abilites would be either 1 for holy, 1 for prot and 1 for ret... OR all three useable by all 3.. But we have a press this every 3 min button in the pet.. for ALL 3 specs.. a blind for only holy and prot.. and a heal for only holy. <br />
<br />
We got zero info about HOW ret will be made harder.. any decent ret will admit that its frikin easy to play as ret.. granted the best of us shine.. but not enough.. so WE ALL want it to be harder.. and we got didly squat on that.<br />
<br />
We got NOTHING about any arua changes.. which are the most iconic thing about paladins.. and have been untouched basically for 5 1/2 years.<br />
<br />
We gotnothing about our talent trees. We got no interupt or closer.<br />
<br />
Yes yes.. I understand.. its just a preview.. i guess I was just expecting it to be on the same level as the other ones.. this one.. it just isnt</div></div><hr />

Oh and to those not liking the holy mastery bonus, which will make your crit heals heal for more. becaue you QQ about overhealing.<br />

And everyone else has said the same. Balance druids don't know how they'll become viable in pvp, they only said we would in our preview. Just like they only said they're changing rets to have more offense and be easier to play.<br />

None of the previews explained everything about any class, because they're bloody previews. Just wait for beta, until then all whining is just annoying and based on nothing but hot air.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
We want to ease off the defensive capabilities of Retribution and Holy paladins slightly. We think the powerful paladin defenses have been one of the things holding Retribution paladins back, especially in Arenas. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
New Ret offensive ability: +Guardian of Ancient Kings<br />
<br />
New Ret Defensive ability : + Holy Shock<br />
+ Sacred Shield 30mins(it was not easy keeping it up all the time and sometimes you traded this global for damage<br />
+ Healing Hands<br />
<br />
- Dispelling<br />
- Slightly shorter Bubble(mostly clicking it of after removing debuffs/getting to full health anyway) <br />
<br />
I know there are serious talent changes to come, but based on this preview Rets will be even more defensive then in current state</div></div><hr />

<br />
Here is what the angel looked like in WC3<br />
I say these are very cool changes. I don't understand why some people say Binding Light is only a holy and prot spell considering you have a macro that allows you to switch between a 2 hander and a 1 hander and shield within seconds. Just macro and use the ability then switch back. So this will be like a CC for paladins which is pretty cool. Just think about if you're out numbered 3 to 1 use macro and use binding light while the others are cced kill one of them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Well, in Northrend a bonus to critical healed amount would indeed be basically useless - most (good) holy paladins I know avoid the +3% healed metagem for just that reason, that Holy Light heals for so much already additional healing just becomes overheal.<br />
<br />
If Cataclysm plays out the way it looks like it will, though, then bonus healing/critical healing will be useful again. In a world where it's not necessary for healers to keep everyone at full health, nor are they expected to try to, extra healing/critical healing will once again essentially become mana efficiency (in terms of saving you a heal or two later in the fight), and overhealing may be reduced just because health pools are so big that no one (often) overheals.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But besides that, as a Ret and FoL spec paladin, i like the changes so far.<br />
<br />
Also, why are people complaining about the holy mastery bonus and sometimes in the same breath complaining about having to go FoL/SP spec? Those seem to work perfectly together, just the old wrath type healing had loads of overhealing...</div></div><hr />

If you think that topping the meters in pugs with 7-8k dps is an achievment, then go back to my initial argument.<br />
If you think that binding devine storm to 50% of your keys on your keyboard counts for &quot;more keybinds than class x&quot; then go back to my initial argument.<br />
If you cannot grasp the concept of a preview, go back to my initial argument.<br />
If you cannot grasp the fact that some of the changes will be quite fun and thus a step forward to an interactive play, go back to my initial argument.<br />
If you cannot understand the sentences above, go back to my initial argument.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fizzlebeard</div><div class="date">2010-04-14, 03:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Blinding Shield (level 81): Seems cool. Giving Holy Paladins some more crowd control, like Disciplines AoE Fear. Even though it has a cast time, it should be very usefull to get out of tight spots or reposition the battlefield, in both Arena and BGs. If you read carefully, only the damage might be negatable by facing away and the blind should always happen. The CC is unavoidable. Making it instant for Protection is good for AoE threat, and should diversify the AoE rotation, but doesn't Holy Wrath do the same for PvE (in case of Undeads)? Unless the Holy talent is very high in the tree, I dont see the use of extra damage, just like the Holy talent that increases Exorcism damage :S <br />
<br />
Healing Hands (level 83): So you heal people in a short radius around you for 6 seconds? Instant cast I presume? As we've seen with the other class previews, it should come very handy in BG situations with lots of people grouped up. But in PvE, expecially with all the spreading out we do due to boss mechanics, I only see this working in melee range. And I already dont always like being in melee for Seal of Wisdom procs. This will make Holy Paladins a melee healer, like Glyph of Holy Light also does. Can't it be a buff you can throw on someone, who then heals everyone around them? This makes it so you can stand on range and makes it a bit more versatile, but might put it too closely to Healing Rain, CoH/PoH and Wild Growth (expecially the last one). <br />
<br />
Guardian of Ancient Kings (level 85): Very very cool and useful for all specs. Prot and Ret are straightforward, but does the Holy Angel work like the priest Hymn; healing the lowest people in the raid (or in an Area from where it spawned?) and determining whos the lowest each second for 6 seconds? Or does it heal one person, the lowest HP when it is summoned? <br />
<br />
Crusader Strike will be a core ability for all paladins, gained at level 1. I'll never level another paladin, but this seems nice for new aspiring defenders of the light. Exorcism usuable while leveling was the first step (in 3.1), this is the next. Tops! <br />
<br />
Blessing of Might will provide the benefit of Wisdom as well. If you are going this way, might as well make them like Shouts, you can buff the entire raid with either Might or Kings, not specific buffs on specific people. Or make the Greater Blessings function like shouts and the minor's like they are now, leaving the functionality to give Might to the raid and Kings to your tanks in a 10M with only one paladin. <br />
<br />
Holy Shock will be a core healing spell available to all paladins. Hoorah?!? Whats the use, if I may ask? Expecially if you want to cut back on Ret/Prot self healing. <br />
<br />
We want to ease off the defensive capabilities of Retribution and Holy paladins slightly. I suspect you are removing spellpower from talents in Ret/Prot, am I right? That would make their heals much less powerful. Though removing cleanse also works to get us out of the defensive works. There aren't much more knobs to turn. <br />
<br />
One change we’re considering is lowering Divine Shield’s duration by a couple of seconds. This is the last knob to turn. I don't really mind lowering the duration, it's more than long enough to do what I want at the moment. As long as the duration is longer than Divine Sacrifice/Hand of Sacrifice for PvE concerns :) <br />
<br />
We feel Retribution paladins need one more mechanic which involves some risk of the player pushing the wrong button, making the rotation a bit less forgiving. Yeah baby! Procs! Spells that are dependable on eachother! Gief! It's not like the rotation is easy now (even though it is considered faceroll), but doing it good and doing it perfect doesnt give a big DPS increase, with doesnt reward skill. <br />
<br />
In addition, we want to add to this spec more PvP utility. Interrupt/Gapcloser as everyone suspected when you sayd you were tempering with survival. Please make the Gapcloser work in PvE too (running back and/or forth from the boss quicker) and not like a snare, which is mostly useless in PvE. I don't want my Vengeance stacks to fall off during boss downtime. <br />
<br />
We want to increase the duration of Sacred Shield to 30 minutes and keep the limit to one target. Please don't. Go for the Discipline raidshielding idea or the Naxx era SS. I don't mind having little AoE healing, as long as my single target tools work in AoE situations. You made a statement about Discipline once, saying that it is a tree based on single target heals, not necessarily tankhealing. And all their tools indeed support single target healing in AoE situations (mass bubbling, Aegis procs on direct heals, etc.) Glyph of Holy Light is a nice example of single target heals that work in AoE situations. Also, make it a Holy Talent. Maybe not make it unlimited number of people, but at least more than one and don't increase the duration. Rather reduce the duration and buff the effect, to increase the Holy Paladin number of heals. Even with Greater Holy Light and Healing Hands, Paladins still have less than other classes, and you want to make one of those tools fire-and-forget pre-pull? <br />
<br />
We want to add to the Holy tree a nice big heal to correspond with Greater Heal. Flash of Light remains the expensive, fast heal and Holy Light is the go-to heal that has average efficiency and throughput. Expected. If Holy Light is changed to be our middle heal (meaning it isn't as mana consuming or hard hitting as it is now, or needs massive amounts of haste to be castable), I hope the Glyph stays. Having our go-to heal have a splash heal would help in AoE situations, expecially in a world where you wont have to spam the tank 24/7 as a Paladin. This, along with Healing Hands and no-limit Sacred Shield (plz?) would increase Paladin's AoE situation. <br />
<br />
Beacon of Light will be changed to work with Flash of Light. While I get why you want to change Beacon (it puts us into the (two) tank heal position too much, which can be boring), I don't know if this is the correct solution. I know where you are getting towards; Beacon helping on stabilizing tanks, not being the only thing a tank needs for staying alive. More like hotting up your tank as a raidhealer to help stabilize him. But only working with our quick, expensive heal (which we wont cast much due to mana?)? Gotta see that in action before I can judge. It WILL diversify healing though, as you want to use HL normally, and go for FoL when the tank also needs heals (along with the target you want to heal in the first place). This makes Beacon a tool which you have to keep an eye on, not a mindless spam because it will keep the tank alive anyways. Kinda like a weird form of Binding Heal, healing your target and the tank instead of the target and you :) And the same thing as with SS: Id rather have the effect increased and the manacost/duration lowered than in reverse. Make it a tool, not a raidbuff. <br />
<br />
Protection paladins need a different rotation between single-target and multi-target tanking. Gimme procs! Like Retribution also needs. The Protection Warrior's rotation (both single target and AoE) is so incredibly fun in comparison with the two macro's Paladins use. <br />
<br />
Critical Healing Effect: When the paladin gets a crit on a heal, it will heal for more. The world will have to be a whole different place if you want to have this mastery work. Crit heals are currently regarded as mostly overheal, and making those crits bigger seems weird from a Wrath standpoint. But if you are really not topping people off all the time (even, as you said, in 5 mans), it could work. And it keeps the crit flavor of Holy Paladins of yore. <br />
<br />
Block Amount: We want to keep the kit of the paladin as a tank who blocks a lot. Seems ok. <br />
<br />
Holy Damage: Any attack that does Holy damage will have its damage increased. This too, nothing special. Wheres our cooldown reducing talent though? :) There needs to be some way to make haste work on paladin's resources (which is GCD's, not mana) or have a manadump ability and have haste increase manaregen. That would also promote haste as a desirable stat the pumps up available resources. <br />
<br />
As warned in advance, its all very conceptual, and I am looking forward to playtesting this stuff and whatever you'll add in the coming weeks.</div></div><hr />

Suck it up buttercup. They hinted at this a LONG time ago. Learn to adapt. The rest of us who listened to the devs understood where they wanted to go with this and the only surprise is the guardian thing.</div></div><hr />

I'm glad for anyone rerolling a paladin now. For the rest I guess I'll have to switch specs around like with my other 80s. I know those are only previews but I hope to get in beta to see what this is all about really. Those change will make my first toon to be leveled a hard choice. <br />
<br />
Now we just have to wait to see what this words means in playing terms.</div></div><hr />
