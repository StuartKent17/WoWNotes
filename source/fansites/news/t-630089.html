I don't think I have ever said &quot;wait and see&quot; though it gets quoted a lot, so maybe I did. I have always said that everyone pretty much agrees that resilience will make things better and the question is by how much. <br />
<br />
Resilience is our primary reward for PvP gear. It is what keeps PvP gear from being uber in PvP gear and also discourages players from using PvE gear to PvP (more on this in a sec). Part of the Arena design is basically that if you win it gives you access to gear that lets you win more (that is actually the PvE design too if you think about it). If we give away resilience too readily, then the Arena rewards don't feel as valuable.<br />
<br />
We know a lot of players are wearing PvE gear right now in Arenas. That is happening for a couple of reasons:<br />
<br />
First, they have that gear. We made the early raiding content very approachable, but we also gave players access to it long before the Arena season started. In early BC it felt like the PvP epic gear was far easier to get than the PvE epic gear, which sent a strange message to a lot of players from which not all have recovered. So in that respect it is nice to be able to say again that PvE is a valid path to epic gear. Unfortunately, we probably went too extreme in the other direction and now the &quot;welfare epics&quot; are from Naxx. (I also want to add that badges and Archavon are great sources for PvP gear without you having to PvP, and Strand and Wintergrasp give a lot of honor if you want to PvP but don't want to Arena. There is also a lot of good starter PvP gear out there but it is blue and some players hate the thought of taking off their purple gear from a few seasons ago. But I digress.)<br />
<br />
Second, when nobody has resilience gear, it allows for a strategy where you can just burst players down in a couple of GCDs. Since the attacks never take much damage, resilience isn't highly valued. What will happen is that once some players start to get resilience, everyone will have to. Once the healer (to use an example) can't be destryoed in a couple of GCDs, the attackers are in a very weak position from the rest of the healer's team. It's an arms race in essence. Once one person putson their survival gear, everyone has to.<br />
<br />
Now I do realize in the past this wasn't true of every spec, especially rogues, though we've tried to avoid that problem this time. I also realize that some players think they die too easily without resilience or will die too easily even with resilience. I'm not trying to wave away all of that feedback. The question was whether resilience was valuable (or perhaps even too valued) in PvP. <br />

Arena Point cap to be changed<br />
We understand the problem and will likely bump the cap. Look for an announcement soon. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/14318875033-ghost-arena-point-cap-is-incredibly-flawed.html))<br />
<br />
Pet mechanics changes is on the list<br />
Yes, I have tried to post several times that the way pets receive buffs from their masters is inconsistent. We need to take a holistic look at stats, especially those like hit, spell pen and haste. It doesn't make sense, for example, for a pet to receive a percentage of your spell hit. Where are they ever going to get the remainder of their hit from?<br />
<br />
Many classes have pets now, and those classes have different stats to provide to those pets. While locks and hunters (and DKs to a lesser extent) are the most dependent on having a good system in place, the whole paradigm just needs to be reexamined. It is on the list.

Achievement: 40 Exalted Reputations<br />
We are aware of the text being a little confusing on this, but right now it is setup to have x amount of exalted factions at the same time. We may change how this works at some point in the future but have no definite plans at this time. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/20/14318935365-40-exalteds.html))<br />
<br />
Achievement: Gotta Go! and Volazj's Quick Demise in a future patch<br />
Gotta Go = 4 minutes; Volazj's Quick Demise = no change (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/20/14133218053-gotta-go--volazjs-quick-demise-fixes-due.html))<br />

Engineering - Scrapbot in Patch 3.0.8<br />
The Scrapbot will indeed gain the ability to repair in a future patch. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/15/6915051835-engineering-sucks.html))<br />
<br />
Using 5 marks instead of 4 for Concerted Efforts repeatable quest (AV + AB + EOTS + WSG + SOTA)<br />
We plan to do this in a future patch. <br />
<br />
DPS comparison between classes<br />
The context is everything. If players are comparing themselves to a dual-wielding DK doing 7000 dps, yes then of course they are going to feel like their dps is puny. But in that example they are comparing themselves to a class in a broken situation. If we notice that players with low or high numbers always have a certain spec then it might lead us to find a bug in the spec. Assassination rogues are a little low at the moment because there was a bug in Master Poisoner for a long time that nobody detected. When we fixed it, their dps dropped. Some fights greatly favor certain classes or specs. Patch is great for classes that can blow their cooldowns to great effect. Warriors like fights like Thaddius with lots of free rage generation through damage. The context is everything.<br />
<br />
We like numbers and it awesome that the WoW community is so good at providing them. Just don't leap to conclusions that the numbers can't support. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/14318865522-the-forum-mindset--our-biggest-problem.html))<br />
<br />
New spells VS. old ones<br />
I think there is some truth to that. We also just get better at designing abilities. The newer spells often (not always) have a more specific purpose, are less clunky or just more fun. This goes for some of the talents too. Warriors compare stances to presences unfavorably and I think there is some truth to that too. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/14318865522-the-forum-mindset--our-biggest-problem.html))<br />
<br />
Player feedback and developers on forums<br />
We generally use &quot;developer&quot; to mean someone who works on the game itself, as opposed to people in other departments of Blizzard who support production of the game. Blizzard is a place where feedback is very important though, so people throughout the company still tend to have a pretty big impact on game design.<br />
<br />
I am a game designer, and specifically I am the lead systems designer for WoW. Game designers are not artists or programmers, but we use the tools developed by the programmers and the assets created by the artists to get content into the game. Programmers make the game run, artists make it beautiful, but it is the designer's job to make it fun. (Though again, Blizzard collaborates more than many studios do and I spend a lot of time talking to programmers or artists about class, mechanics or even achievement design.) I think a lot of players mistake me for a CM because I tend to post a lot more than most WoW designers. Mostly, I just don't sleep so it lets me play WoW, work on it during the day and still have time to post. Game balance is one of the most controversial aspects of any multiplayer game, and I benefit from being able to engage the community directly. Systems design specifically is everything that is not level, story, quest or encounter design. My team handles everything from classes to mechanics to items to trade skills to achievements to UI design, and that includes the game balance.<br />
<br />
I do want to stress that we are a team. We come to a consensus on every major change to the game. I put enormous faith in the team to make the right call and keep any of us individually from doing something stupid. Blizzard is in a position to be able to attract and retain the best talent available in this industry. Many of them are much better game designers than I will ever be. Mostly I try and stay out of their way. A great many of them read the forums. Everything you type is seen by silent blues. I see people reading the forums when I drop by their office. We talk about what they have read all the time. These guys care passionately about doing the right thing and making the game as good as they can. Your opinion is extremely important to them. Just keep that in mind every time you post. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/14134474969-gc-please-stop-posting-here.html))<br />

[US] PvP Servers free character moves<br />
PvP character moves ended 24 hours ago. We're reviewing populations to determine the best way to move forward, as we only opened up transfers from the most impacted realms, and players on several more realms would like the option of moving characters as well. A lot of people haven't had the option yet of moving a character off of a high population realm like you have.<br />
<br />
The transfers didn't end because &quot;the problem isn't as bad&quot; either. They ended because the destination realms filled up. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/14318875917-gg-blizz.html))<br />

http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/24x24/deathknight.jpg Death Knight (Skills List (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=650) / Talent + Glyph Calc. (http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?deathknight))<br />
Frost Presence threat hotfixed<br />
We are looking into this issue and found one bug that we are hotfixing. I will attempt to explain:<br />
<br />
Most auras go away when you die, but some don't. Frost Presence and Defensive Stance have some effects that go away and some that do not (this is the bug). It ends up that a DK who dies loses some of the threat bonus from Frost Presence, but doesn't get it back when he comes back to life because the game thinks Frost Presence is still active and doesn't attempt to reapply the buff. If you change presence from Frost to something else and back, then all the buffs get reapplied correctly, but most tanks probably aren't doing that.<br />
<br />
So it's entirely possible that if you die and come back without changing presences that you have just gimped your threat generation. You aren't losing all your bonus threat generation. You are basically losing the amount that we gave all tanks to compensate for pulling Blessing of Salvation out of the game.<br />
<br />
If all of that confuses you, the take home message is we fixed a bug where your threat would be low after dying. Again, by the time you read this, the bug should have been hotfixed.<br />
<br />
It is likely this bug was also affecting warriors in Defensive Stance and the hotfix will catch that too. It was not affecting paladins or druids because their spells work differently.<br />
<br />
We don't know if this is the entire issue with DK (and possibly warrior) threat being low, but it should help, especially if you ever die while raiding. Some of the guilds who are seeing this problem have very high dps, which implies they have experienced the content a lot and might not be dying that much.

Improved Faerie Fire<br />
I went ahead and looked at this in game, and I am happy to report that I was wrong. Any Faerie Fire should allow you to get the 3% crit, even if you didn't cast it.<br />
<br />
So the tooltip should probably read: Your Faerie Fire and Feral Faerie Fire spells also increase the chance the target will be hit by spell attacks by 3%, and increase the critical strike chance of your damage spells by 3% on targets afflicted by [anyone's] Faerie Fire or Feral Faerie Fire.<br />
<br />
I don't always have the game right in front of me when I am reading forums (most often I am on a painfully topical beach sipping mai tais) so I try not to guess unless I am pretty sure about something. I was pretty sure about this, but I was wrong. It happens. There are like 15,000 spells in the game. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/14133419591-yes-or-no-gc.html))<br />

Player theorycrafting vs. Developers numbers<br />
Players generally do a great job generating numbers with what they have. They don't always have the most up to date numbers, and we don't make a herculean effort to get numbers to them. PTRs are our best shot, but even they can lag behind our most current builds.<br />
<br />
As a most recent example, Elemental shamans were perplexed by why their numbers were different from ours and there was some amount of shouting that we didn't know what we were talking about and why couldn't we just accept the community's numbers and balance around those? It turned out that the shamans had misunderstood the way a talent worked (almost certainly because of unclear statements on my part) and that when they were able to test on the PTR, their numbers were close to what we predicted. Happy ending.<br />
<br />
I don't know know why the EJ hunter numbers you cited don't match ours. It would take a great deal of time for us to dig through all the numbers that we are presented with to understand where the disagreements occur. In this case I suspect it is because Explosive Shot does less damage now than it does on the PTR, but I don't know. Survival is a miniscule percentage of total hunters out there, so we really won't mind them getting a significant bump, but it isn't our intent that they are far and away the highest dps hunter spec (BM shouldn't be either).<br />
<br />
We do our tests under a variety of conditions, and fully raid buffed is certainly one of them.<br />
<br />
The Ulduar comment I made has been widely mininterpreted, but I made it because so many players were using the argument &quot;We may be okay now, but we won't scale.&quot; While some players understand &quot;scaling&quot; perfectly well, it also gets thrown around a lot by less-informed players as the generic reason for why something fails (&quot;RNG&quot; occupies that niche on the PvP side of things sometimes). In the hunter case, it may be that they do scale just fine but it is irrelevant because we are rebalancing hunters for 3.1.<br />
<br />
GC while im excited that your changing us for 3.1 that is months away. Will you be inclinded to hotfix us if you see Live dmg output is extremely low?<br />
Yes. We are even trying to build in more hooks when we do things like this so we can do changes if needed. <br />
<br />
Also GC consider that there is a reason why Survival is not played by most hunters. The mechanics for the tree feel too clunky and with the addition of 30 sec CD to LnL that isn't represented on the UI, the tree has become extremely Clunky. <br />
Fair enough. Just buffing dps isn’t always enough to change something from not fun to fun. There are however some hunters even in this thread who want to play Survival and just can’t justify it at the moment. <br />
<br />
Cunning pets overall just are a waste of code at this point. Roar of Recovery is useful, but at a 6min cooldown makes it a drop in the bucket.<br />
While 400 dps is low, you are making the assumption that anything that isn’t a raiding pet is a waste of code. Those pets weren’t intended to be for raiding – that’s what Ferocity pets are for. Thanks for all of the numbers though, Neruse. <br />
<br />
Sorry we're a bit panicky ... we're all thinking of Ret Pally's back in Beta and how you didn't listen then when folks said they were OP and umm ... they were?<br />
Sure, but the Ret pallies said they weren’t and were really upset with the magnitude of the nerfs (which turned out, I think, to be on target or even a little light). I understand what you’re trying to say, but players can be very selective about when we’re supposed to listen to them or not.<br />
<br />
On LnL, we’re still messing with the specifics on it. It’s too early to comment until we have something we’re happy with. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/14318915694-hunter-damage-between-specs-still-seems-off.html))<br />

Rogue DPS getting better in Patch 3.0.8<br />
Patchwerk isn't necessarily the perfect test case for dps. It is a simple fight, but these days it is also getting very short and some classes thrive on short fights where they can maximize specific abilities or cooldowns. The rogues don't have to move, but neither do the hunters or Frostfire mages. The warriors aren't getting a ton of extra rage from collateral damage.<br />
<br />
But I tend to agree that rogues are too low. They should look better in 3.0.8 when some of the 6000+ dps outliers are brought down some.<br />
<br />
I think in retrospect rogues (talking Assassination really) were the victims of a couple of tricky bugs. We all freaked out at the damage they were doing near the end of beta and lowered their damage only to find later that a few poison bugs were causing some of the excessive damage.<br />
<br />
The primary reason we haven't fixed it yet is because rogues seem to be doing very well in PvP and careless dps buffs for noble PvE purposes could just make that situation worse. I do apologize for the situation rogues are in currently and we hope it will look better after 3.0.8.<br />
<br />
P.S. I know some players don't give a fig about PvP and are offended that we have to worry about PvP balance when solving PvE problems. WoW is enjoyed by a lot of different players for different reasons and we try to keep them all in mind. (Source (http://))<br />

Defensive Stance threat hotfix<br />
This thead has gone pretty far afield, but I did want to mention that we hotfixed a bug where warrior threat in Def Stance would sometimes be lower following a death. Basically, the threat modifier was not being reapplied properly until you changed stances.<br />
<br />
We don't imagine this was a huge issue in threat generation but there were certainly cases where it cropped up. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/14287349581-why-nothing-blue-regarding-prot-wars.html))<br />

<br />
Mages, DK, Rogues and Ret. don't want resilience, even if Deadly Gear was free, they wouldn't used them.<br />
<br />
<br />
Once the healer (to use an example) can't be destryoed in a couple of GCDs, the attackers are in a very weak position from the rest of the healer's team<br />
<br />
<br />
This is false, i have +900 resilience and don't survive that long, even with the WG tenacity buff, with around 50.000 hp, im dead in a few seconds...<br />
<br />
<br />
Because you have 10 people pewpewing you in WG at once? You get tenacity for being outnumbered...<br />
<br />
Here's how it is supposed to work (whether resilience contributes enough is another story):<br />
<br />
Scenario 1 - No survivability (% health)<br />
<br />
ClassStartRound 1Round 2Round 3<br />
Healer1003000<br />
DPS100505050<br />
<br />
<br />
Scenario 2 - Healer has high survivability (% health)<br />
<br />
ClassStartRound 1Round 2Round 3<br />
Healer1005030100<br />
DPS1005000<br />
<br />
<br />
Once the healer can survive the Round 1 burst the DPS damage drops off, the healer can heal themselves up, and the DPS eats dirt.<br />
<br />
Scenario 3 - Both have survivability (% health)<br />
<br />
ClassStartRound 1Round 2Round 3<br />
Healer100503010<br />
DPS100704010<br />
<br />
*&quot;Rounds&quot; are arbitrary lengths of time, GCDs, 10s, minutes, whatever.<br />
<br />
Once both have survivability, the healer can survive the initial burst and the DPS dealer can survive long enough to make sure they can wear the healer down. Who will win? Hopefully the player with the highest skill.<br />
<br />
GC's statement is true - once the healer has survivability to outlast the burst, then the DPS has to worry about survivability too.<br />
<br />
(All caveats of PvP not being a 1 vs 1 game etc. apply - it's an illustration, jerks :P)</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wildi</div><div class="date">2009-01-14, 12:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">PvP Balance - Ghostcrawler on Resilience<br />
..What will happen is that once some players start to get resilience, everyone will have to. <br />
is not going to happen because:<br />
<br />
Some classes with very little escapability have to stack as much resilience as they can, while other classes have built in survivability so they can afford to not use resilience and focus on stats to increase their burst. <br />
<br />
Warlocks, priests and shamans are forced to stack resilience. Mages, paladins, dks and rogues can run around in pure pve gear and be just as hard to kill, but are able to kill you. <br />
<br />
Once the healer can't be destryoed in a couple of GCDs, the attackers are in a very weak position..<br />
<br />
Killing someone requires damage, not resilience. Burst classes do not necessarily need huge crits to burst people down. Resilience has little to no effect on large non-crit numbers + see above whats going on in pvp.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Your point is both erelivent and false because of these very simple and easy to understand points that EVERYONE seems unable to understanding..<br />
<br />
The resilience cap is impossible to achieve even with full deadly<br />
Point for point damage stats give far better results then resilience<br />
High damage gear is by far easier to get then high resilence gear<br />
Even if you do obtain high resilience and last 50% longer.. 50% of 2 seconds is still only 3 seconds.<br />

I currently play a mage and at the start of the season I obtained all the PvP gear I could lay my hands on, specced my fav frost PvP spec that I had planned out from level 70 and went into the arena and lost.. <br />
<br />
then I lost some more.. then a few more times.. so.. I went away and loaded myself up with PvE gear.. reduced my HP by over 1500.. reduced my resil by over 600 but gained 600-800 more spelldmg for 20 seconds and specced arcane..<br />
<br />
This alone has seen me cakewalk to 1650+ rating and I have enough rating and points to buy the hateful legs and gloves but right now they worstless to me and I would rather run with my heroics / T7 gear.</div></div><hr />

Clothies with low escape abilities and are left tanking mellee are forced to rely on resilience.<br />
<br />
What happens when a mellee player catches up with you? You get hit like a hammer right?<br />
<br />
Welcome to the world of other clothies that dont have escape abilities like mages.<br />
<br />
I agree with Ishir.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Then you are a retard.. and I will enjoy farming idiots like you for free rating.. because what your tiny little brain can't seem to graps is that resilience is not doing enough and you will be waiting 2-3 season before you get a decent amount of resilience. At which point who gives a shit? melee willl most likely all be in uldar gear and ripping you a new one aways..<br />
<br />
How can you be so blind to see that I am actually on your side and give solid and valid reasons why simply waiting for people to get resilience and see whats happens in pointless because..<br />
<br />
* The resilience cap is impossible to achieve even with full deadly<br />
* Point for point damage stats give far better results then resilience<br />
* High damage gear is by far easier to get then high resilence gear<br />
* Even if you do obtain high resilience and last 50% longer.. 50% of 2 seconds is still only 3 seconds.<br />
<br />
Honestly L2READ and use your brain!</div></div><hr />

<br />
This really is good stuff. At least now we know exactly why they haven't done shit to fix us. Whats great is the rogues that truly dominate in Arenas are in some of the best PVE gear. Whats that mean Blizz?? They PVE too!!! So by fucking us so were not OP in PVP, your not only screwing every rogue that doesn't PVP, but also every rogue that does (since all PVE also). I have said it a million times... <br />

I suggest you roll a disc priest alt or warlock alt so you can get some better experience.<br />

Resilience will become your primary stat to farm.<br />

Swoosh.. please can you actually read my posts.. I hate repeating myself..<br />
<br />
My point is simple.. no amount of resilience current in game is going to help the classes that dont have escape abilities live long enough to do anything? Is that truely so hard to understand?<br />
<br />
Furthermore for every point of resil a shaman, priest or warlock gets. I get 3 points of SP and 2 points of crit.. so at no point will I start exchanging my damage for resilience unless something very dramatic happens.<br />

Hense something else has to be done.. wtf is your problem? <br />

I dont have a problem.<br />
<br />
Some classes are totally dependant on resilience to do well in arena. And you are just wrong to say otherwise.<br />
<br />
That is all.<br />
If by savage blue gear you mean T7, and if by worked their way to the top you mean they teamed up with rogues in full 25man naxx gear and if you mean amongst the best classes you mean ranked #5 of 10..<br />
<br />
Then yes your totally right.. otherwise your really of course. Further more I never said that some classes not dependant on resilience.. <br />
<br />
I merely pointed out that for those classes no amount of resilience currently in game is enough to prevent classes being gibbed.. and for the problem classes point for point damage is better then resilience (stat wise / effectiveness) so at no point will the problem classes trade damage for resilience.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I play a Restoration Shaman, I have 3 pieces of Hateful Restoration , 2 pieces of Savage Elemental and Resilience in every other slot aside from my shield and weapon. I'm at work and logged in my T7, but I should be at 8-850 Resilience with ~17-18,000 hp.<br />
<br />
Every 3v3 I do, I die immediately. I'll usually be hiding in the beginning, but once my team requires heals, I roll out and the entire opposing team converges on me and I explode. PvP specced with PvP gear, trinket and proper totems down... it does no good. I often don't even get the opportunity to do an NS heal.<br />
<br />
We were at ~1700 on the first day of the season and have been dropping ever so slightly since. We would be a lot lower, but my friends are able to beat about 1/2 the teams we face more or less 2v3.<br />

I play a Mage and without Resilience I'm nothing. I can't afford to play in PVE gear. I can't lose the Resilience nor can I lose the extra Stamina. Mages are not hard to kill.

Mages will be too powerful when they can out damage healers and they cannot. Mages still can't kill a Discipline Priest, but all melee classes can. Simply because melee vs clothy is unbalanced.

First off what kind of idiot doesn't pay attention when PvPing .... that has to be one of the dumber statements ive heard in a while.<br />

ROFL... second off ill say that i play a mage as my main and i hate arcane spec cuz its cheezy and skill-less (which is clearly the reason you like it) .... and no people dont complain about AM its ABa that crits for 5-7k followed by a skillful pom FB which crits for 10-12k at 80 which is just retarded considering ur mobile while doing this and its practically the opponents entire hp bar (even when they are geared) follow that up with another skillful ABa and your opponent is dead for sure, all of this is within the 4 sec silence .... so please dont act like arcane is not overpowered and broken, cuz ur just dilusional.... ill enjoy seeing your qq when they nerf that one trick pony spec to the ground which they will... <br />

Oh and one more thing ur friend got hit with a 12k SD proc execute while the war had a full rage bar which is getting nurfed unlike ur 12k pom fireballs in the upcoming patch.... peace out and have fun killing people while pressing 1 button while u can, cuz i promise u it will get nurfed just wait and see....</div></div><hr />

Your point is both erelivent and false because of these very simple and easy to understand points that EVERYONE seems unable to understanding..<br />
<br />
The resilience cap is impossible to achieve even with full deadly<br />
Point for point damage stats give far better results then resilience<br />
High damage gear is by far easier to get then high resilence gear<br />
Even if you do obtain high resilience and last 50% longer.. 50% of 2 seconds is still only 3 seconds.<br />
<br />
<br />
I currently play a mage and at the start of the season I obtained all the PvP gear I could lay my hands on, specced my fav frost PvP spec that I had planned out from level 70 and went into the arena and lost.. <br />
<br />

<br />
You're disagreeing with a completely different argument (and a lot of people do this when GC starts talking about resilience).<br />
<br />
To quote the relevant part:<br />
I have always said that everyone pretty much agrees that resilience will make things better and the question is by how much. <br />
<br />
For some reason people quote comments relating to the first half of the sentence, and then submit arguments relating to the second half.<br />
<br />
I'm not trying to wave away all of that feedback. The question was whether resilience was valuable (or perhaps even too valued) in PvP. <br />
<br />
GC's (and my) argument is that survivability (and resilience) make a difference - that widespread high resilience will force a change in the game.<br />
<br />
Your (and many other's) argument is that resilience doesn't give enough survivability in the current situation.<br />
<br />
The conversation in this thread has moved on, so don't come back to my original comment (unless you REALLY want to). However, keep in mind for the future that these are two different discussions.</div></div><hr />

<br />
totally agree with u<br />
<br />
and to Statix: <br />
without resi u're nothing cuz u're arcane so same is muti rogue, he's awesome at few first secs of battle and then he gets pwned, playing arena for now is hard I agree but as frost I didn't need to hit more than 400 resi to have no bigger problems with melee, I mean seriously try 20/0/51 and team with priest or rogue and u will need no more than 400-500 resi to pwn , arcane is spec for &quot;skillzors&quot; who have keyboard with 2 buttons: spacebar to jump and other one with barrage to spam it while u're jumping. And mage/priest is very good even if u meet rogue, if u play it well there's no problem to not get 1700+</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tiredhealer</div><div class="date">2009-01-14, 05:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm not going to argue if resilience is going to make everything fair and even. I do think if resilience is the factor that makes everything balanced it is a poor system that makes some classes have to have it play and others not at any point in time. <br />
<br />
Equality should be a given, not something that is earned. Some classes should not be dominate without resilience when no one has any. Resilience is only on pvp gear that is not attainable until after you're able to defeat those that don't need it to defeat you. <br />
<br />
In battlegrounds I often see some people just mill around the graveyards. I really don't blame them, just attempt to play for 10 seconds and you'll be back again, why not just stay.<br />
<br />
The whole gear system for PVP is flawed. PVP gear stats should make you better but not give you a massive advantage. A system that over time allows you to leverage your begining advantage to even greater advantage just because you played a certain class make no sense. <br />
<br />
Blizz says there is no way to balance classes. This may be true in a perfect sense, but they can do a better job than current WOW. <br />
<br />
I think after watching PVP for the expansion I have to believe that it is working as intended. I have the belief that Blizz has very talented people running it and that the current state of PvP is just as they planned.

I would say we are definitely worried that players are dying too fast, particularly to a handful of specs that combine high damage with high survivability. We know resilience will make a difference, but they jury is still out on whether it will make enough of a difference. Regardless, it's clear a lot of players aren't having fun, so it is something we are talking about. (Source) (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/14134474969-gc-please-stop-posting-here.html)<br />

The problem was the same on the PTR before WotLK was shipped. Nothing has changed except most dps classes have been buffed. When you have to power to make changes and leave things as they are, that is WORKING AS INTENDED, if it's not intended you change it.</div></div><hr />

There's not much logic to it, at least in the sense that we have some kind of Standard Operating Procedure that we follow.<br />
<br />
Some changes are very simple and a designer can just go to their desk and make a change in a few seconds. We try to hit lots of these rather than let them all get bottled up behind the big, complex issues we are wrestling with.<br />
<br />
Other changes are almost as easy. A designer feels like nobody will really object to a change and that it's pretty low risk. At most they might bounce it off one or two more people as a santiy check.<br />
<br />
Other changes require a lot more discussion. We might not all agree. We might need to run some tests or calculate some numbers to see what the effects of changes might be.<br />
<br />
Sometimes we don't know how to fix a problem. A great example of this would be a case where a spec is doing too little damage in PvE and too much in PvP. You can't just juice talents or coefficients without making them too good in PvP. These kind of changes require a lot of brainstorming and creative solutions.<br />
<br />
Controversial changes require a lot of research. We read the forums. We ask our friends or thought-leaders in the community what their opinions are.<br />
<br />
Some changes are risky from a bug standpoint. These require a lot of testing to make sure they work. Having a spell just fail is bad. Having a spell cause an exploit where players can get loot they haven't earned or win an Arena fight they should not have won is worst. Crashing the servers is about the worst thing you can do (but most of us have done it at least once.)<br />
<br />
Some changes are hard to make and require programmer support. Maybe we need new tech to implement a feature (this was the case for a lot of death knight abilities).<br />
<br />
Some changes require buy-off from a large number of people. Changing a talent is a relatively minor fix. Making big changes (say changing how arena works, or major class mechanics) are the kind of thing we want to run by just about every senior person on the team to get thier feedback.<br />
<br />
I get the sense sometimes that players expect (or at least want) us to attack problems based on which is the most pressing problem. That is definitely an important consideration. But it is all about triage. Sometimes even a pressing problem isn't worth handling right away if that means 30 minor problems can't get fixed. Developing games is a pretty chaotic process. There are a lot of interruptions. There are a lot of considerations that have nothing to do with the actual product going on the shelves. In a game as large as WoW it can be easy to get demoralized because you just don't have enough hours in the week to get to everything you want to do. Features get bumped to subsequent patches or expansions all the time. (But for all the chaos, it is still a lot of fun).<br />
<br />
Also, when you say that an entire tree was unfinished, you have to understand from our point of view that we feel that way about every tree. Blizzard is it's own worst critic. If you asked us which tree was the closest to being perfect, we would be very hard-pressed to answer that. We aways think we can improve on the game, down to individual talents. We are never going to stand back and say &quot;That's it. We nailed the Survival tree. It's done.&quot; (Source) (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/13392252182-gc-how-do-you-prioritize-your-to-do-lists.html)<br />

<br />
Druids, Shamans, and even warlocks will see minor improvements in rep but it's going to have less to do with them being stronger. Warlocks could only get better at this point. I see Druid and Shaman resto builds making a push. Their biggest obstacle is Rogue combos especially with an arcane mage.<br />
<br />
Hunters, I see only going downhill unless they really pick up the slack.<br />
<br />
Death Knights and Holy Paladins are gonna drop in rep big time. So my guess is paladins are going to shift toward teaming with either mages for the ret/mage combo or another dps beside DK. Deathknights could start teaming with Priests or Druids.<br />
<br />
People are going to realize Ret pallies are either balanced or were nerfed too hard.<br />
<br />
You're gonna see Rogue/Priest and Rogue/Mage get big jumps in rep more due to rogues rather than the mage or priest classes. <br />
<br />
Rogue are gonna be singled out as the boogey man followed immediately by the equally cheesy arcane mage. <br />
<br />
Priests usually stay under the radar so they don't have much to defend against. I don't see frost mages being targeted by nerf bandwagons simply because the build was made much more difficult with the dispel talent changes.</div></div><hr />

Fail troll is fail.<br />
<br />
<br />
This has been a cat and mouse game going on with ghostcrawler and the rest of the development team since Alpha information was leaked. The developers wanted the game to revert back to 'PVE' organization, and while I am not going to mine through information for sources, I think it is quite clear to be the case.<br />
<br />
The availability of 'epics' through the pvp system is overtly distasteful for most classes at the moment. The honor-based pvp set offers, at best, mediocre resilience and stamina builds. The thought, time, and process built into the PVP gear lacks beyond what I would consider 'well-planned' design. <br />
For my case in point on design of the rewards: the resto shaman healer PVP set. The design of the set is for +mana regeneration. <br />
<br />
No shaman sits in the top 10 on the 2v2 ladder. In fact, only two shamans make it into the top100 teams. But 8 deathknights and 7 paladins sit up there.<br />
<br />
One shaman sits in the top 10 on the 3v3 ladder. But, 9 paladins and 6 death knights sit in the top 10. Six shamans are in the top 50 on 3v3. Six out of 150 players.<br />
<br />
<br />
--The entire concept of organizing five players to do ten games a week is not workable. I can barely even get my teammates online to do 2s and 3s. Not to mention the diminishing returns on points the current system offers. To design a system around 5v5s or to even include them would be rather pointless. Reading the Arenajunkies.com forums, though, it appears the most important thing a shaman should do in 5v5 is to blow bloodlust after the gates open to ensure that the team has 30% bonus damage before you die.<br />
<br />
So, back to the topic at hand, is pvp really being reviewed in a way that can demonstrate ANY changes that will be seen? Not really. The only reasoning behind the current hunter-readiness nerf is that it allowed for additional burst periods in PVE content. I do not see Deathknight nerfs coming in regards to PVP content as much as I see them being nerfed for PVE burst.<br />
<br />
Do I think in the future things will change? I doubt it. I keep hearing people boast and rant about previous Arena seasons, how they want 'chess' games back, and how things 'were so great back then'...try playing a hunter and being told, every season, that major hunter changes will be coming that make you viable in Arena and in pvp. Those were supposed to come with Wotlk.<br />
<br />
Ironically, I hear paladins fighting teeth, claws, and everything else they can throw/sink in to keep themselves buffed at their current state. Deathknights are in the same boat. Their survivability goes beyond that of all other classes.<br />
<br />
Do I think a reduction in only critical damage will mitigate the problems with Arena combat? No. I'm not retarded. A 20% reduction from a 10k pyroblast is still 8k damage. Couple that with 2 Arcane Barrages and I'm dead before Counterspell drops. &quot;Where is your partner at this time?&quot;...while attempting to force the conversation in another direction...he's in the corner.<br />
<br />
He got sapped, saw I got focused so he trinketed. Now he's polymorphed and I'm dead because I couldn't get out of LOS while stunned, and once I hit my trinket I couldn't heal because I was counterspelled.<br />
<br />
---Beating a dead, rotting, maggot infested corpse over and over is important, especially when the lead developer on the video game sits next to it and acts like it does not exist, and then that 'look the other way' policy is reinforced by individuals who get their jollies off to imbalanced combat for personal awards such as titles, mounts, gear, and 'clout' -- all of which are currently considered 'merit' from a biased, neglected, and poorly designed system.</div></div><hr />

If you don't think the current PTR documented changes are organized for Deathknight-tanking skills and talents versus dps you're on crack. Aka review what you're even discussing before you bolster a retarded opinion. The only thing I can take from the current Deathknight situation is they are removing some Unholy burst capability as well as tanking ability and transplanting it into hit-return in the Blood line -- effectively making blood just as viable for Arena creaming.</div></div><hr />

That's not what I said, you little reject. I'm saying those changes are going to have a big impact on their performance in pvp. And if you don't think Blizzard hasn't considered the pvp ramifications than you don't give them enough credit. They know perfectly well those changes will have a great effect on pvp. Some of the changes incoming are everything to do with pvp and not so much pve. Perfect example is the DnD glyph.<br />
<br />
<br />

And what opinion is that? That's death knights got some major pvp nerfs and Blizzard is aware nerfing pve hurts pvp? <br />

I don't see Blood becoming more popular than Unholy. Unless Blood is stronger than Unholy or as equally strong as Unholy is now, it's an overall nerf to DKs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you don't realize how ridiculous that glyph is in pvp then you haven't been pvping.<br />
<br />
And no, they don't have 15% more magic mitigation than before. You have to consider all the changes. Not just the small itty bitty buffs. I'm a mage. I understand full well DK defenses are gonna be much easier to get around or wait out than current.<br />

Next up, someone tries to convince me the Shadow of Death nerf was a result of it being op in pve.</div></div><hr />

It wont make a huge difference in arena.<br />
Alot of players are still playing with macroed strangulate and mind freeze and hope for glyph procs.<br />

DnD Glyph nerf just sorts the men from the boys. ;)<br />

<br />
he sais they must buff rogues dps in raid ....... if they do that then the damage in arena will go up too.<br />
<br />
as a rogue i think that if they give us more damage in arena it will be way way way too far OP....<br />
<br />
so i think in order to go buff dps of rogues in rid they actually need to work on energy regen,,<br />
<br />
for example an idea is <br />
<br />
FOCUSED ATTACKS ..... change the talent to provide 4 energy on proc..... so a rogue in a raid can keep his cycles up without suffocating...cz i played some raids as mutilate and i think energy is the big issue in that tree...<br />
<br />
and the good thing is that FOCUSED ATTACKS procs only on crit so a rogue in arena will not see a difference due to resilience preventing him from critting (depends on resilience when ppl get some)<br />
i think its something to tweak a rogue in PVE with the minimum effect in PVP....<br />
<br />
boosting our damage any more than it is will be ridiculus ..<br />
any other rogue that agrees???? <br />
<br />
pls ppl keep this thread civilized its just and idea...dont go mpla mpla about arena and 2 shotting ppl and so on this is about PVE.....<br />

I like to see some hard evidance that our class is not being nerfed to a lousy top 10 to 15 finish. Also, why are the raptors the top pet now.

<br />
Its not so hard to make a class do more raid dps but lower their burst damage.<br />
<br />
Not so hard at all.<br />
<br />
For example, for a rogue you lower the base damage of say mutiltate, but increase the energy regeneration rate.<br />
<br />
I mean im not genius enough to figure out the exact numbers, but i dont think it takes a genius to experiment with this does it?<br />
<br />
<br />
But what about those classes who only can wield 2H weapons? Like ret-paladins. It is in the nature of slow 2H weapons to produce spike or burst damage.<br />
The funny thing is that the very same happend to Shamans. Before TBC shamans had no dual-wield and they were known for pretty heavy burst damage. So Blizzard gave them dual-wield. Now history repeats with Paladins again. One might think Blizzard hasn't learned a damn thing ;)</div></div><hr />

Anyone saying Mages are to powerful right now needs to look at how each melee class rapes a Mage if he doesn't pay attention. Even a Resto Druid in Cat form can nuke a Mage to 75% health in a few seconds. Sure, their damage output might be high, but Arcane Mages are extremely squishy.<br />

<br />
Wow, who would have thought anyone at blizzard knew what they were talking about.<br />
<br />
Remember how fast the nerfs came when Blizz decided to do them. Do you remember how long it took everyone yelling to get them to actually do it. It's easy for players to argue with each other whether or not Blizz wants to do something or not, but there's no way to argue if they can do it. With a billion dollars minimum in yearly revenues it is a considered business decision on how much will be spent on up keep of the game. And you can't argue about the time it takes to test or correct imbalance, that is still based on the amout of revenue Blizz decides to put into it. The fact that arenas started out in such a poor unbalanced state was a decision Blizz made. With everyone leveling and starting out even, Blizz had a once in several years chance to get it right. Actually it was worse than season 4. They had PTR data about resilience, if resilience was so important to balance in arenas, how did they allow season 5 to start without everyone having max resilience. It was said there could have been a resilience aura over battlegounds and arenas to the first few weeks to allow some balance until everyone had time to get gear. There were a lot of ways to have fixed it. Where was &quot;not till its ready&quot;. Where was the testing.<br />
<br />
Instead of quoting Blizz, as to them knowing the situation, or them looking into the situation, see how long it takes them to fix it. The truth of the matter is even if Resilience were to fix PvP everywhere, it was and is an unfair system that starts out with some classes needing it to survive and other classes not. This becomes even more true when you must win against those that don't need it, in order to get equal gear. The method of getting areana gear where you have to win to get it only works when there is absolute balance between classes and spec of those classes. I think everyone will agree that this is never. When there is imbalance some classes or specs are, by that imbalance, put at a great disadvantage. This disadvantage only grows as the season progresses. <br />
<br />
All the talk of how they think Resilience will balance it later, or how they might be worried about people dying too fast, is just that, talk. If you learn nothing else from this remember, pay little attention to what people say, but pay alot of attention what they actually do. Past action is a much better indicator of future action. If history holds true Arena balance will not come soon.<br />
<br />
The current arena system encourages people to quit if they are unable to win early. If you are new and just learning to play, soon you can't even use the few points you get from your attempt, because of ratings on the gear. It was better when Blizz awarded more point to those who had higher rating, but had no ratings on gear. By putting ratings on the gear it prevents someone from starting out behind and working up by a lot of effort and time.<br />
<br />
I often see on forums that lower skilled players should not get the good gear it should only be for the better players who earned it, what do the so called better player have to fear from lower skilled players with equal gear. It would seem to me the victory over a equally geared player would be more enjoyable than just beating an undergeared under skilled player. <br />
<br />
Again maybe this is what is intended, maybe this is what balances the load on the severs best. Maybe Blizz makes more money if you only play one aspect of the game. Maybe they make more money if you play less and decrease the load on the servers. I guess this is true, fewer hours per player, more players per server, means the amout of expense per account is less. Maybe we should take the advice of a famous lawyer, &quot;Follow the money trail to find the truth&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
ROFL... second off ill say that i play a mage as my main and i hate arcane spec cuz its cheezy and skill-less (which is clearly the reason you like it) .... and no people dont complain about AM its ABa that crits for 5-7k followed by a skillful pom FB which crits for 10-12k at 80 which is just retarded considering ur mobile while doing this and its practically the opponents entire hp bar (even when they are geared) follow that up with another skillful ABa and your opponent is dead for sure, all of this is within the 4 sec silence .... so please dont act like arcane is not overpowered and broken, cuz ur just dilusional.... ill enjoy seeing your qq when they nerf that one trick pony spec to the ground which they will... <br />
<br />
unlike ur 12k pom fireballs in the upcoming patch....<br />
<br />
<br />
It's impossible for Fireball to crit for 12k with the spec I curently have. Even Pyroblast only crits for 7k, 9k if you count Arcane Power. It's impossible for Fireball to crit for 12k with any spec. Only Frostfire Bolt can do that and Frostbolt with Arcane Power up. <br />
<br />
To say I suck based on my spec is wrong. I played Frost for a very long time and I plan on going there once my PVP gear gets better. You should check out all the Gladiator Mages out there; I'm pretty sure 90% of them uses this spec. One thing truly shows here, you haven't got a clue how my spec works. You can say it's skillless, but it's far from that. It sure enough doesn't require as much skill as Frost, I'll give you that, but you only have one Ice Block and no Ice Barrier, that procs a Frost Nova when it's destroyed, you don't have Ice Armor that increases your armor by 930 and has a chance to freeze people.<br />

There are a lot of players that don't pay attention in PVP. Just look at Battlegrounds; how often does a team lose because players don't pay attention to the bases or the flag...</div></div><hr />

I know some players don't give a fig about PvP and are offended that we have to worry about PvP balance when solving PvE problems. WoW is enjoyed by a lot of different players for different reasons and we try to keep them all in mind. (Source)<br />

Bring back a way to reduce glancing blows and everyone will be happy.</div></div><hr />

WTF ever. Since when do we let the first asshats to clear content to start making content for the game. If that is a future trend then it is a bad one. The problem is that WotLK has NO tank enchants for weapons that are worth using. The TBC ones beat all of them. Also, if they would have had to keep introducing new versions of titan grip, where the hell is a new version of potency that does what the enchant was originally designed to do.<br />
<br />
What I see really happening is the dk community got up in arms because this enchant wouldn't be usable by them so Blizzard decided to kiss the dk population's ass and not introduce titan grip.</div></div><hr />

Here I was thinking Blizzard had stolen everything from Mythic by now. I guess I was wrong. Why don't they go ask Mythic how to fix their crappy programing for them seeing this has been in MMOs for at least the last 6 years.</div></div><hr />

Why on earth do they take all this time to fix a so annoying thing. Oh I forgot: they had to fix the clams.<br />

<br />
All the people who found they had a problem at certain times with DK threat can now say they were right. And others who said L2P can now stfu.<br />
<br />
<br />
It seems funny to me that a good dk tank can gear well and spec right and have very little problems with threat, but a bad dk can gear horribly and spec horribly and then whine about threat. Yes, you have problems with threat with certain talents that were designed for DPS, but for Blizzard to say that they would have to call you an idiot, and instead they redesign the class around the newbs that play it.</div></div><hr />

Rogues need nerfs not buffs. Way over powered. What medication is GC on these days?<br />
<br />
<br />
They are extremely under powered on from a PvE stand point. If you want to play with balanced melee in PvP then go buy WAR.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
The very easy solution is to scrap the stupidity of resilience and start capping burst damage in PvP. There is a reason games with successful pvp in the past have always had a different stat cap for pvp then they did for pve.</div></div><hr />
