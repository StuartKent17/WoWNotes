Darkmoon Faire Cross-Realm Zone<br />
Honestly I kinda like the CRZ'd DMF. I think bustling and crowded is the expected state of any worthwhile carnival.<br />
Yeah, and that's the intent behind CRZ as a whole. The Darkmoon Faire being CRZ'd is intentional, the problem is it's just allowing too many people into the same cross-realm instance right now and causing some overcrowding issues. Much of the intent of cross-realm zones is providing the experience of a lively massively-multiplayer environment, even for lower level zones where players don't tend to congregate as much any more. We certainly want the Darkmoon Faire to always feel like you're visiting a mystical carnival full of excited patrons.<br />
<br />
We've developed a fix and that will be implemented with Tuesday morning's rolling restarts. Let us know what you think afterward, and we'll be closely monitoring the changes as well.<br />

Patch 5.4 Legendary Item<br />
The furthest anyone has gotten is to receive the 600 ilvl cloak that was implemented this patch (I believe?). The actually weapon, I'm assuming, won't come out until 5.4.<br />
You're certain it's a weapon? ;) (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/262003-has-anyone-actually-finished-the-legendary/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/9234983487?page=1#15))<br />
<br />
Conquest Catch Up System<br />
After looking into the reported issues with catch-up caps not being appropriate I wanted to clarify on a few points.<br />
<br />
(Week of season x 1000) - Total Conquest Points earned this season = Conquest cap <br />
<br />
This calculation is not actually 100% correct and does leave some room for interpretation. To clarify on the formula and to ensure that you are all aware of how your Conquest cap should be calculated:<br />
<br />
(Week of season - 1) * 1000 – Conquest points earned this season + Cap received from your current rating = Weekly cap<br />
<br />
As you can see, your cap from rating should be added on top of the catch-up cap and the first week of the season is not included in the calculation, I have corrected my previous posts to reflect this. The reason that the calculation is actually uses &quot;Week of season - 1&quot; is because if we included the first week then we’d basically be giving players an extra 1000 points in the first week. The goal of this system is to give players who haven’t been maxing their conquest a way to catch up, not to give everyone an additional boost in the first week.<br />
<br />
In addition to this, some of you have stated that you noticed some of your catch up cap disappearing mysteriously, try doing the calculation again with the new formula provided above. If you are still missing some of your catch up cap, can you provide some additional information to help us with looking into this matter such as; your current Conquest point cap and the amount of points that you have earned so far this season.

That's anyway just an attempt to get money for transfering even from those that said so far that it is too expensive for them(and let's give them just a week time so they have to make a quick decision. Always works...). Blizzard is fooling us and using us as cash cows instead of fixing the issue. Customer service? Forget it!</div></div><hr />

Here is the thing, GC said almost immediately that the feature was something that most people would go ´meh´ about.<br />

It is like with everything.. players just exaggerate anything... something gets mentioned, next thing you know it was promised..<br />

GC said from the very beginning it was a feature HE was excited about.. that is all, he then purposefully tried to lower expectations... which is why he said most people would day ´meh´.. now you have people talking about player housing, cross-faction raids, legacy servers and all types of stupid stuff..<br />

Probably the unannaounced feature is somenthign really marginal and a basic QoL improvement that the hype isn't justified at all.<br />
<br />
So instead of letting people build insane hype and then go all around raging/whining, they have just cut its legg off right now by saying &quot;hey, don't hype. It's something cool but not that much.&quot;<br />
<br />
He already did that.. within days of him first mentioning it, GC said that most people would go ´meh´ about it. HE never hyped, it, the players did.<br />

GC himself started all the craziness. It isn't as if they said &quot;there's going to be a big feature in 5.4&quot; and people just ran off with it. GC said it would change the game as much as the dungeon finder, and love it or hate it, it changed the game a lot. So people are naturally going to try to reason out a possible new feature as big as DF.<br />
<br />
They said exactly the opposite. The said it was NOT going to drastically change the game, that it wasn´t something on the same scale as LFR or LFD.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It could mean that the big Cata's feature was supposed to be the hability to xmog the gear and LFR was supposed to be the big MoP's feature, but the plans had to be changed leaving MoP without a new and revolutionary feature so they had to make a new one but with less time.</div></div><hr />

Yes, because they expect the new feature to cure cancer, bring world peace and make WoW the best possible game for the next 1000 years. And then they are pissed because the feature doesn't cure cancer.</div></div><hr />

Actually, straight from the off, they said that some players will think it's cool while others will be underwhelmed by it. The downplaying of expectations for this feature happened days after GC's original tweet where he mentioned it back in January. This doesn't stop people running away with their imaginations and expecting a feature that will do nothing less than return the game to it's glory days, walk the dog and PM winning lottery numbers so when they inevitably downplay expectations again we have people like yourself crying out &quot;Mea culpa, it's Diablo 3 all over again&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Not really, but that is Blizzard's fault when on my server the horde side is nearly nonexistent, and thus I cannot play the game I paying for. Asking money for transfer in a subscription game is pure greed.</div></div><hr />

Although one of the best feelings when tanking is when you get good enough reflexes/feeling for cooldowns that you manage to contain even disastrous mispulls, especially undergeared. Stratholme fears/spectres, crowded BRD or Scholomance while leveling, or just an oblivious ranged DPS standing in the way of a pat in a heroic - and a couple of charges/taunts/stuns later the whole area is littered with mob corpses, and mob corpses only... as long as at least the healer is awake, that is.<br />

My apologies, my new-found friend . To be honest, I replied to your earlier post when I had my mind half on other things, but yeah the weight of unbridled anticipation is growing ever stronger over this feature. It's largely their own fault; GC let's out a hint months in advance, knowing the gaming community can whip themselves into a frenzy over such things, and now days before the relevant patch hits the PTR instead of just telling us what the damn thing is he decides to downplay it (again). It's like a known gossip tossing in a shit grenade of unfounded rumour and innuendo and watching the drama unfold.</div></div><hr />

Players want communication from Blizzard<br />
Blizzard communicate they have a new feature coming that some will like and others won't<br />
Players hype the new feature to be the next coming of Jesus<br />
Blizzard reminds players that it isn't a big deal<br />
Players blame Blizzard for their and accuse them of lying.<br />

This is what the original quote said. Clearly, he acknowledged that it would be something of similar scale to LFD/LFR and have a big (&quot;huge&quot;) impact on the game. <br />
The &quot;hype&quot; is only his fault, either because he's very naive and stupid or wanted to bait and switch players yet again like they've done several times in the past (character models, dance studio, etc)<br />

I thought the inference that the &quot;unannounced feature&quot; would have similar impact akin to LFD and LFR was quite clear in that tweet myself without my special &quot;invisible text&quot; reading glasses on, which is now being downplayed by GC.

All I see him saying is they haven't announced what it would be yet. That is ALL I can read from it. Thats all anyone should read from it. how do you get it would have a similar impact? He didn't even mention lfr or lfd, the person asking the question did.</div></div><hr />

Because that was specifically part of the question which GC replied to. He didn't reply to the question &quot;does 5.4 have an unannounced feature&quot; or &quot;do you have any undisclosed features planned&quot; but specifically if Ghostcrawler felt if any of the MoP features had an impact akin to that LFD and LFR and his reply was that he felt that the &quot;unannounced feature&quot; they were working would be that feature.

Well no. Let me quote the exact question for you. <br />

Yeah, he did, and the whole thing is getting quite silly now as a result from a comment which he himself originally made. Considering how near the 5.4 PTR I really don't see why he doesn't just announce the thing already instead of these futile attempts to downplay a fire which he started. Sure, the people whipping themselves in a frenzy over this feature should chill out, but this has to be one of GC's major Twitter blunders.<br />

Again, basic reading skills. They were absolutely mentioned in that question in the previous sentence. Look mate, try and twist it all you want, but it's there in black and white and to deny otherwise only makes you look like a fool. So feel free, counter my point that the question absolutely specifically mentions LFD and LFR.</div></div><hr />

For all you know it's something vastly more rewarding than a weapon that can't be transmogged and will last a total of 3 months before it's useless again. Maybe something that actually deserves to be classified as legendary.<br />

Nothing to do with lack of tank roles, as the popular hero class did little to change that.<br />

<br />
Everyone who has been following along from the beginning and took all the hints already knows exactly what the new feature is.<br />
<br />
Hints<br />
1. A lot of players will go ´meh´<br />
2. It is not a game-changer like LFR, LFD<br />
3. It will open up a lot of content for some players.<br />
4. It is something players have asked for.<br />
<br />
Those are basically the only 4 paraphrased quotes we have from the devs. That is IT.. everything else has been imagined by the community<br />
<br />
But the bigger hint is regarding new tech this expansion. Blizzard LOVES to use new tech everywhere when they finally get it. ( see phasing, CRZ, vehicle fights, bad-luck rolls). They invent a new tech and then go out of their way to add it wherever possible. For instance, bad-luck protection was added for LFR loot rolls, next thing you know it is being added for pet battle bags, scenario bags etc etc.. By 5.4, probably any RNG thing will have bad-luck protection<br />
<br />
So lets look at some other new tech added this expansion<br />
<br />
1. Scaling of players gear - Big one.. was done as a major part of challenge mode dungeons, and now being done again with the pvp changes this patch.<br />
2. Player scaling - Added in 5.0 for battlegrounds.<br />
<br />
I have no doubt that the new feature is the ability to downscale yourself to run low level dungeons at the appropriate character and ilvl. There are a lot of questions, like will you be able to queue for it? Will there be rewards/gear/vp?<br />
<br />
It answers all of the real dev hints<br />
<br />
1. Most people will go meh about it because most of us have already run those dungeons to death.<br />
2. It doesn´t really have a huge impact on the overall game (unless it is a major source of gear or vp, which I doubt)<br />
3. It will open up a lot of content, especially for players who leveled using BGs or questing. There are probably a ton of players out there who have never done a bunch of dungeons, and if there is a queue system, they can now do them with a reasonable amount of challenge<br />
4. Mentoring is a feature in many other games</div></div><hr />

<br />
Now, even though I would personally love such a novelty, I'm sure there are lots of people who will hate it with a passion...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not really, it was mostly fansites who began these conversations using only half of his tweets. He said that HE personally was excited about this feature, but then almost immediately said that most players wouldn´t be very impressed. The second one was barely mentioned on fansites. And then there is the constant misquote. They said that it WOULD NOT be on the same scale as LFR or LFD as far as impact on the game.. but many threads on fansites keep saying the exact opposite.<br />
<br />
It is basically like most rumors.. it started out on twitter, but it grew to a monster on the fansites and turned into something completely different than was orginally said.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm not saying I think it is, but it's a little worthless to jump to conclusions.<br />
<br />
That is my issue. Ok, let´s pretend it is a legendary weapon. You are not going to be getting it as soon as 5.4 launches, there will be some questing, and probably a lot of collecting of something in SoO.. So probably we will get it a few months after 5.4... so what is the big deal? you get a legendary weapon to use on a raid you have on farm... and then you will replace it in a few months with a green item from the next expansion.<br />
<br />
It would be much more fun if it was something that was useful at least throughout the next expansion ( ie, non-gear). At the very best, a weapon would be the equivalent of a 463 ilvl weapon now.. something that is useful through the next expansions leveling process and into heroic dungeons.. But even that is doubtful because it would be absurdly overpowered when we get them in 5.4</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kelimbror</div><div class="date">2013-06-05, 07:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">*snip*<br />
Yep...I'd rather the old notion of a legendary weapon fade into the dust. If they can't let you transmog it, there's really no point to having one. (as much as they like to say otherwise)<br />
<br />
I'd prefer a legendary package where at the end of it you have a combination (or all) of:<br />
<br />
Transmoggable gear or weapon, perhaps just a skin instead of an actual item.<br />
Title<br />
Mount<br />
Potential new spells that provide cosmetic buffs in order to visually display your greatness.<br />
<br />
An example of that last one would be a class specific special glow effect that can be activated to surround your character. Maybe druids get a green tinged glow and vines follow your wake, with a bird that flies from the sky and lands on your shoulder every now and then.<br />
<br />
Priests could have a halo and translucent, moving wings that play harp music everywhere they go.<br />
<br />
Etc.</div></div><hr />

Yeah. I think it will be another nail in the coffin of dev-to-player casual conversation. GC and the others will learn that they can´t talk casually to players on forums or things like twitter. <br />
<br />
The next step will be the only information players get about anything is official press release type marketing stuff. <br />
<br />
There are just a lot of stupid people who can´t separate ideas from promises, or discussions from plans.<br />

Got that right but what I find more funny than his twitter postings is gamers seem to be more hyped/interested about a unannounced feature than the rest of the patch that they know about.<br />
<br />
That doesn't bode well for the upcoming patch.<br />

<br />
I think when it comes to gamers it best to either spill the beans with 100% accuracy on what the developers plans are and hold nothing back as some sort of secret. No twist on words or hints or this is what we are thinking...<br />
<br />
EITHER do the above or just STFU and just don't say anything till you can do the above.<br />
<br />
Anything in between just turns out bad with players having to imagine how content will turn out or what it will be and we all know where that leads. (More hype then developers can wrangle. Then they act as if it was all bad hype)<br />
<br />
It seems to be a never ending cycle.</div></div><hr />

EITHER do the above or just STFU and just don't say anything till you can do the above.<br />
Except they've tried this method before, which is met with people complaining about the lack of communication, or lack of things to look forward to, etc.<br />
<br />
There's really no right way to do any of this to be honest, but generally people prefer some communication over none, regardless of how much they complain about what is said.</div></div><hr />

overhype is a bad thing. And thats whats happening, it can be special but THE MOMENT YOU OVERHYPE SOMETHING it goes bad. People got overhyped for diablo 3? i believe it was, and everyone was let down. They probably learned to actually control hype to have realistic goals.<br />
<br />
sorry but anything can be not &quot;special&quot; if its overhyped, due to the fact of let downs</div></div><hr />

Clearly, he acknowledged that it would be something of similar scale to LFD/LFR and have a big (&quot;huge&quot;) impact on the game. <br />
The &quot;hype&quot; is only his fault, either because he's very naive and stupid or wanted to bait and switch players yet again like they've done several times in the past (character models, dance studio, etc)<br />
As seen in this thread, apparently they can get away with this because fanboys will always make up an excuse for them.<br />
Hilarious.<br />
he also few tweets later said some ppl will meh at it, and tried to cut hype down.</div></div><hr />

Players want communication from Blizzard<br />
Blizzard communicate they have a new feature coming that some will like and others won't<br />
Players hype the new feature to be the next coming of Jesus<br />
Blizzard reminds players that it isn't a big deal<br />
Players blame Blizzard for their and accuse them of lying.<br />
<br />
This is why I just love the WoW community...<br />
<br />
A coy tweet isn't communication. Openly describing the feature would have been communication and people would have liked it. The tweet hyped itself by being compared to LFD/LFR without giving any information at all which is Ghostcrawler's fault.<br />
<br />
Don't blame the players for Ghostcrawler's incited hype.</div></div><hr />

<br />
that was what I was getting at. They cannot do what this guy suggested because whenever they talk about something that is in early development, then players react with ´liars´ or ´promises´ if anything changes about it. If 3 months ago GC had described exactly what they were planning on doing, and then it somehow changed because of development or testing.. then players would call him a liar.<br />
<br />
Like the guy you quoted, players are just not mature enough to understand things like a development cycle or or how things changes constantly during testing. Players are just too stupid to be told something while it is being planned because they think it is carved in stone now matter how many *´s the devs put about ´this is our plans´ ´this is what we want to do´.. anything mentioned is instantly a promise.<br />
<br />
So their only course of action is to ONLY talk about something after it is nearly finished being developed and tested.. ie.. like the stuff we see on the launcher.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In case you haven´t noticed, the ´whining´ usually dominates any other real conversation. I was just talking to someone today about how the forums were when BMAH was announced.. how every thread was domnated with people complaining about something they barely knew about. ( how hardcore guilds would buy the entire tier before heroic modes were even released).</div></div><hr />

2. Why would you tease and hint at something? What's the point? The only thing I can think of is to build hype. So he did something to build hype and then got mad when it got hyped up? Is he mentally challenged? He could have easily just not mentioned it and just released the damn thing. He also could have just announced it instead of hinted. Dumbass.<br />
<br />
3. Other games with a lot less money offer free transfers. They, unlike Blizzard realize having people play on dead servers is bad for the game. Having them pay to move when it's the company's fault is just disgusting and greedy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For LEGENDARY.... Patch 5.4 Legendary Item<br />
The furthest anyone has gotten is to receive the 600 ilvl cloak that was implemented this patch (I believe?). The actually weapon, I'm assuming, won't come out until 5.4.<br />
You're certain it's a weapon? ;) (Blue Tracker / Official Forums)<br />
1st http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTXYwf0cpZQ<br />
2nd http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhsnOo-iWuA<br />
what if...<br />
...now i couldn't find actual quote from blue post but someone asked will we be ever see legendary and blizz said - yes, 5.4 will award you actual legendary item. I believe he said &quot;item&quot; but I'm not 100% sure or &quot;5.4 will award you with legendary.&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
And here is exactly what I am talking about.<br />
<br />
What did Ghostcrawler actually hype? Did you ignore the fact that fansites, even THIS OWN ONE linked parts of his tweet regarding the &quot;new feature&quot; while completely disregarding the end part where he tells people not to overhype things.<br />
<br />
It was fully and completely the fault of the fans.<br />
<br />
I get so tired of all the Ghostcrawler hatred. I dont even particularly like him, but I hate the moronic posters who automatically yell &quot;GOOSTCRAWLER RUNED MEH GAME HE IS ALL PROBLIMS!&quot; without having any clue whatsoever to what they're talking about.<br />

1.) All they said was that we were getting an actual legendary item (As opposed to a gem or enchant), not a weapon.<br />
<br />
2.) They talked about it because people were asking about it.</div></div><hr />

I recently dropped my sub because it feels old and stale to me atm. I've been playing off and on since vanilla and know that is why it feels that way. On the flip side I can't help but hope that the next expansion is cool as hell and draws me back in(fingers crossed). Oh, and yes the vocal peeps on forums blows out of proportion everything Blizz does, be it good or bad, and tend to hype everything beyond reasonable expectations.</div></div><hr />
