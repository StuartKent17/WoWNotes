Or they could, you know, take the time they're spending implementing pokeymans to work on more content, so people will be less bored at endgame.<br />

What, pray tell, leads you to the conclusion that they've relegated PvP assets to creating pet battles? Anything other than &quot;I feel like it's true?&quot; <br />
<br />
It's just like people complaining that there will now be fewer new models, fewer new maps, fewer new... well, EVERYTHING. Apparently, the department that's working on the pet battles also encompasses 90% of the work on ALL of World of Warcrafts numerous facets?<br />

I don't think you have an accurate gauge of exactly how many people are &quot;standing around in cities.&quot; People stand around in cities waiting for queues to pop. People stand around in cities talking to guildies while flying in circles over Stormwind, hell, People stand around in cities just to stand around.

All right, we get it, you don't like it. Too bad, it's in, and it seems there are a lot of people who are looking for something else to do.<br />

If I wanted &quot;something else to do&quot; I'd...you know, go do something else, outside of WoW. Like, you know, play a different game. I don't need to have Pokemon inside WoW, there's already Pokemon outside of WoW.<br />

No you wouldn't. You would sit on a forum and try to troll the people discussing upcoming content. You aren't cooler than anyone here... and implementing another game into a game is brilliant business-wise, and something that very few people are actually upset about. The ones crying about it are the ones who's coolness factor actually hinges on whether or not &quot;poke-mon&quot; gets in their WoW. So quit pulling the tired old rhetoric about &quot;Well if I wanted to do something else, I would blah-blah-blah.&quot; You are just the same as everyone else here, except you are the only one crying about positive changes that thus-far everyone here has liked.</div></div><hr />

Nah, it's fine as it is. I do prefer these midis way above some of the Hollywoodied &quot;MAJESTIC&quot; orchestra pieces this game has.</div></div><hr />

You do realize that most of the people who enjoyed Pokemon in its original times are now around 18-20 years old right? I believe it attracts more people of these ages, one being myself, than kids.</div></div><hr />

Try 26, The original Pokemon attracted people around 12-14, we are now almost 30 haha. So it spans a larger audience, and all the people who are getting angry about his are just stupid and have never actually sat down and played pokemon.</div></div><hr />

Why do you want the UI team to be designing endgame content? Because it's the UI team that's designing the pet battle system.<br />
<br />
Also, I'd think someone with a My Little Pony avatar wouldn't be such a hypocrite when it comes to &quot;childish&quot; things.<br />
<br />
As for &quot;game within a game,&quot; this is certainly not the last time an RPG has done it. Final Fantasy VIII, IX, X, etc., all had collecting minigames, as did FFXI. Hell, Everquest has an entire trading card game built into it.</div></div><hr />

Like, you know, play a different game. I don't need to have Pokemon inside WoW, there's already Pokemon outside of WoW.<br />
<br />
I really do not see what Blizzard is trying to do, implementing an entirely different game into WoW. I mean, what next, are they going to implement Farmvi- oh wait, they already are.<br />
<br />
¯\_(ツ)_/¯<br />
<br />
<br />
A game within a game? Almost as if it's some kind of miniature game, you might be on to something here, since clearly no other game has ever done such a thing or been wildly popular doing so before!<br />
<br />
Seriously, have you ever played a video game before? I'm seriously asking since you seem to have no idea that mini games exist and are extremely common distractions from the main quest in innumerable games.<br />
<br />
Also, you're a brony, you're not really in a position to complain about anything. Grow up.</div></div><hr />
