No seriously, and it's also more expensive like WoD.... god damnit. Now the bait is &quot;early access to DH&quot;. So we will be able to level one during WoD?! One hell of a bait I have to say...<br />

The boost doesn't cost them anything. If the game is sold for $50, it's not because a boost is included. It's because of what it cost now to make an expansion. Yes, even if you say there's less and less content every expansion release, this is probably what it is. So to make it seem like it's not too bad, you get a &quot;$60 value&quot; free boost. There's no value to a computer, automated, process. There's cost for quest design, art assets, music, voice over, cinematics, and these has kept increasing in scale and quality.</div></div><hr />

True enough but Blizz's record on that isn't what you would call great now is it WoD released 1 month earlier then its latest advertised date.<br />
June release seems to be more realistic, release together with the movie.<br />
<br />
Anyways we will know tmrw from Blizzcon what the real deal is.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Still not any better. There is so little content for this expansion as a whole. There is even less to do than in Mists. Rehashed dungeons don't count. They are there to literally keep players paying in the mean time for the next expansion.</div></div><hr />

Looks like SoO just got beat out for longest raid tier. SoO: 14 months. HFC: 15 months, that's without any sort of pushbacks.<br />
<br />
Reminds me of this video, Yahtzee's review of the Orange Box: http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/zero-punctuation/10-The-Orange-Box<br />
<br />
http://zeropunctuation.wikia.com/wiki/The_Orange_Box if you CBA watching the video.<br />
<br />
I can't help feeling that Valve have missed the point of episodic gaming somewhat. The whole idea is to mix up the usual rigamarole of game publishing by having shorter games at lower prices released more frequently, and while they have aspects one and two down, they continue to struggle with three. I seem to recall Valve promising that Episode 2 would be longer than Episode 1 to make up for the longer wait, but I guess that got kicked in the head somewhere along the line.<br />
<br />
What is Blizzard now, some Fel Lord version of Valve? They've completely missed the point of &quot;more frequent releases&quot;, given WoD will last 2 years, MoP lasted 2 years, Cata lasted 2 years, WOTLK lasted 2 years, TBC's length the closest they've come to &quot;one year&quot; (one year and ten months) except they didn't even promise what Valve did - lower cost.<br />
<br />
And they're certainly shorter. 2 raid tiers instead of 3...<br />
<br />
No wonder they just announced they will no longer release sub numbers.<br />
<br />
Edit: oh, &quot;BY September 2016&quot;. That's still ridiculous, though, and weak, especially considering their team working on it is is at its BIGGEST EVAR.<br />
<br />
Also, lol at the &quot;Preorder and you get an extra week with DH!&quot;</div></div><hr />

They've already stated that there won't be another content patch for WoD and this is just, WOW!!! If they expect to keep people they need to do more than they're doing. What happened to more content patches and quicker release dates. I was half way expecting them to rock the boat and say Legion was going to be out in March or April. Not another year plus of no new content. WoD gave them the largest loss of subscribers so you'd think they'd feel the need to change something but clearly it's business as usual so they will continue to lose people as WoD dredges on...bravo Blizz, bravo...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just for future reference, the Warlords preorder projected date was December 20, 2014, and it released on November 13, 2014. So it's safe to say that September is a fairly conservative estimate.<br />
<br />
Still, even if they get it out in July or August, they better announce a 6.3 coming soon, or a very early launch of a BIG pre-event with a 6.3 or 7.0 in Q1 or Q2, or they're in serious trouble.<br />
<br />
As it stands, I'm probably going to suspend my account on November 15th just because there's not enough new stuff coming out to keep me logging in. And I don't unsubscribe from this game lightly. I've got a couple Tokens sitting in my bag so I might come back briefly for the new Winter Veil stuff, but... I really need something more if they want me to keep logging in.</div></div><hr />

Of course that is the &quot;worst case date&quot;. That's wouldn't be so bad if it didn't feel like Blizzard will hit that mark. Things haven't looked good in years for WoW. This kind of thing plays into some stuff we've already heard, and that's Legion coming out around the time of the movie release. We are easily looking at another 6-8 months of current content, if not much longer. I'm still optimistic that tomorrow will bring some major announcements. If Blizzard needs that much more time to make Legion amazing, I'll gladly wait. However, what we've seen thus far makes it hard to believe they do.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This was expected. If you expected otherwise, you are living in a fantasy world outside of the game itself.<br />
<br />
WoD was rushed out the door. That cannot happen again.<br />
<br />
Also- the pre-patch event was strongly hinted as happening much earlier than most pre-patches.<br />
<br />
Something big will happen when 7.0 drops. 7.0 will not be the expansion launch- just like 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, and 6.0 were not the expansion launches.<br />
<br />
Many of us warned you to not be Pollyannas for the past year. The game is struggling to get it's act together.<br />

<br />
That's what I thought too when I saw this. Blizzard once again failed, and failed more miserably than ever with this hack of an expansion. They screamed that the reason we got so little in the way of content is to get it out faster, and that we'd never see another year + last patch. To what should be no ones surprise, Legion is now slated for September 2016, 10 months from now, making HFC one of, if not the longest, patches in existence, running from June 2015 - Sept 2016, or 15 months. <br />
<br />
Guess I can finally give up on Blizzard as anything other than just another money grabbing company that no longer cares about their customers or delivering a quality product, as long as their bottom line isn't effected. I seriously hope that from now until Legion, at least half of the remaining die hard fans come to their senses and see just how much they're being robbed by this fallen consumer friendly company.</div></div><hr />

But seriously, this thread is really entertaining. Love seeing all of you cry.<br />

I came here to check If theres is anything left for me to keep me interested. I don't play WoD since January and I will still not play it. You go boy, play this shit ;)</div></div><hr />

But this is unacceptable. Even if it is 1-2 months earlier...this just shows they got their major focus and ressources spend on other projects...<br />
Sure they want to deliver this time, but absolutely NO content for 8-10 months? I am a huge wow fanboy and I always wanted to believe that things will get better in the future, but thats just me being naive af. The raids in WOD were good, they fucked up almost everything else. Even if Legion comes in 8 months with a free blowjob I will hardly consider if I could trust those guys with all the bs they are pulling off.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Looks like I'm in the minority. I think the biggest problem with WoD was with how rushed and unfinished it was. I would much rather they take their time and deliver an amazing, finished product.<br />
<br />
I'm with you because your comment makes sense. The only question I have concerns beta. Lets take the worst case scenario and say the expansion drops in September of 2016. If beta is suppose to start before years end, 2015, is that not a hell of a long beta test? What is a typical beta test time? If the worst case scenario of September 2016 pans out, that leaves me to believe that beta will not start this year. But anyway, if waiting longer keeps us from getting another WOD, I'll be happy to wait.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Redecle</div><div class="date">2015-11-06, 02:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">LOL<br />
<br />
There better be 1-2 more huge WoD patches + pre-exp event patch incoming, if Legion reaches that max date or past July.<br />
How the game currently is the maximum release date should have been february, at the maximum latest march.<br />
This is just bad, bad for business, bad for players, bad for everything. <br />
How WoD went down and if Legion really has been in production since WoD launch, if they really want to pull this game upwards Legion would have to be something really special, i'm talking industry revolutionizing and be here lot sooner. Only solution to faster is throw money at it, A LOT. The revolutionizing gameplay, i don't know, 10 year old engine isn't the tool for that, innovation in story telling and such can only take you so far.<br />
<br />
And of course there's a pre-purchase claw, early access DH, the PR people sure know how to sell. There goes the hype train.<br />
If only people would realize this and stop throwing that pre-anything money to anyone, and that's not just Blizzard it's this nearly whole industry that's doing the same thing.<br />
<br />
I have to admit i'm still intrigued, mostly cause of 10 years spent with the game and story, but there's no way i'm pre-purchasing anything ever again, in the last two years too many times has that gone wrong. Even if that 'by august' means something like June/July a break and unsub is inevitably coming.</div></div><hr />

Even if it gets released a little early, like July ou August, that's still 3 full quarters from the numbers released this week.<br />
<br />
This. Their announcement about sub numbers is absolutely tied to this - and they're softening the blow by announcing it now, instead of onstage at Blizzcon. The release date is a HUGE thing to announce in the opening ceremony. My jaw literally dropped when I saw it, and thought it HAD to be a joke. <br />
<br />
The only way this is acceptable is if they announce a major content patch for WoD, arriving in the next couple of months. Maybe you guys are getting Faralhon after all. There will be nobody left playing of they go as late as July! And to the white knights - they did not pick that date randomly, that's not how it works. They judged that they might have enough work to do to require that much, plus some wiggle room. That means they don't have that much done yet. Or, they have systems that aren't working yet - like the artifacts. <br />
<br />
And, forget a beta announcement tomorrow. More like Q2 '16 for that. <br />
<br />
Something is wrong in their dev team, it's very clear now - and they need to fix it, this kind of delay for short expansions at a higher cost is not going to sell. <br />
<br />
The Q&amp;As are going to be VERY interesting this weekend. <br />
<br />
You white knights better scramble, this is going to take massive amounts of effort to spin positively. And it's hilarious, as usual!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Announcing sub numbers to begin with was stupid on their part. The popularity of the game was going to diminish over time no matter what happened. If they were so wrapped up in the early hype that they didn't realize the graph would drooping eventually then that's on them. Stopping the sub announcements is not a defeat, it's just rectifying a mistake.</div></div><hr />

Did I say anything to even remotely suggest that? Hell, I flat out said I was going to unsubscribe if they don't have any noteworthy content patches planned for the interim.<br />
<br />
I just said that when they did this for Warlords, it was a conservative estimate and actually launched more than a month before the hard deadline. We still don't know when the actual release date is, but they're legally required to offer a projected date before they can start selling preorders, so they have to do something. To take it as gospel that it absolutely won't release sooner than September is wrong.</div></div><hr />

I'm fine waiting another year for the expansion. The thing that irks me is that Blizzard has yet again under-planned the content for the lifespan of an expansion, and will be charging $15 per month for zero content for almost a full year leading up to an expansion that requires a purchase. I hope they prove me wrong and announce a patch 6.3 sometime during Blizzcon. Literally every other MMO in existence plans out content patches and their release cycles better than Blizzard.

Sure, but based off WoD and LotV, it'll release roughly maybe 2 months (MAX) before the expected date. This still puts us at a July release. Which IMO is still 2-3 months longer than it should be.<br />
<br />
There is absolutely NO excuse for Legion to take that long. They have promised and assured us WAY TOO MANY TIMES that they don't want final raid tier year long droughts to happen, yet, here we are. Again. For the 4th time in a row.....</div></div><hr />

<br />
I know the date scares us. But that is NOT the RELEASE date. It could still be BEFORE September 2016. The beta is still on for 2015, unless... y'know. Announced otherwise tomorrow at Blizzcon (But that would be incredibly stupid for Blizzard to do).<br />
<br />
People said EXACTLY the same about wod, and it started only a month earlier than the deadline, so if you're set to get Legion at August, it is still a shameless try to rip off people with almost a year of no content.</div></div><hr />

Just unsub and come back for the next expansion. No one forces you to stay subed. There's literally no game that provides great new content at the same rate people consume it, there's always going to be gaps. Remember we used wait 5 years+ between games not too long ago.<br />
<br />
<br />
Waiting 5+ years is a little different when it's not an MMO. Something like WoW needs fresh content to thrive. I'm not particularly concerned about the wait, it's what I expeted, and frankly I'm happy about the gap if it means we get a real expansion and not another shit show like WoD. I'm just pointing out you can't compare an MMO to your average game, they are completely different.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Magnosh</div><div class="date">2015-11-06, 03:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Blizzard is playing very good at the moment, they saw the disappointment of players and all the topics created about not 'pre buying' the game after the lack of content they gave us in WoD and the amount of people that brought the game before it was even remotely close to release, it got to a point were people who would do that now would be actually dumb and asking for another fiasco and still thanking blizzard. So, they decided to influence the game towards players who pre buy the expansion giving them a week early of leveling and knowing the new class. The real question is:<br />
<br />
- with that week will players be able to go above lv100 on theirs DH? <br />
<br />
If they can blizzard might have just won the lottery and brought herself a new 'free to slack'/'we got the gold without keeping promises anyway' expansion.<br />
<br />
The launch date if it is anyway near September (or August tbh) is sad, after Dragon Soul they said they didn't wanted tiers to last as long, then came Siege of Orgrimmar which lasted longer and now Hellfire Citadel can last even longer. I can see 3 hypothesis for this:<br />
- They don't care about playerbase enough to change<br />
- They have very very very very poor organisation skills. I don't see a point for rushing Highmaul like they did or even BRF if the plan was to have 12moths or more of HFC.<br />
- They want to end the game and therefore keep pushing players away while still trying to get as much money as possible out of the remaining faithful fans.</div></div><hr />

<br />
How many times does Blizzard say &quot;We want to shorten the gap between the final Tier and the new expansion&quot; and &quot;we've increased our team size to help push content out faster&quot;, yet, here we stand. We are going to have another year-long final raid tier, and not only that, but the smallest content expansion we've had to date.<br />
<br />
Sure, Legion looks EXTREMELY promising, but this really is a buzzkill. Not sure why they aren't pushing for an April/May release.<br />
<br />
Morhaime or Chilton or Brack had better get their ass onstage tomorrow and address what the hell is going on with them and the WoW team and why things are taking so long, the more people they hire, the longer it takes. No, really- they need to address this honestly, once and for all.<br />

They can focus on other games and newer ones to try and make the most out of them, whilst keeping WoW 'active'. If necessary, and things go awry on other games, they can simply re-focus on WoW for one expansion, and see if people still give it a chance.<br />

I'm not disagreeing what you're saying. But that being said, none of us work at Blizzard, and the beta hasn't released yet so there's no point kicking up a storm yet when it's still possible the game will have a much earlier release than September.<br />
<br />

Maintained implies that they stayed at roughly the same level the entire expansion. 5 million is the bottom of the decline this expansion. They started at 7 million, rose to 10, then dropped to 5.4. 50% loss. There is no &quot;maintaining&quot; of the subscriber base when the graph just shows a constant decline.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It must be. They've said beta is 'this year'and beta won't be longer than 3-4 months.<br />
<br />
Beta won't be this year even with a June or July launch. With that time frame you are looking at January-February for beta to start, maybe even into March. We won't see beta until at least April/May and with that it puts the launch in the August/September time frame. What they needed was beta to start after Blizzcon and launch in early spring. Funny how they waited until after market call to lease this information as well as no longer going to be reporting quarterly sub number. I am sure this was done on this launch coming so late that their is now going to be a massive amount of people heading for the door. <br />
<br />
Best case scenario the expansion drops in 9 or 10 months and with that how many people are actually going to preorder this time around, without knowing what the actual content is going to be and not just the stuff they show at the dog and pony of Blizzcon.</div></div><hr />

I'm not so wrapped up in this I can't function. I'm just slightly annoyed/disappointed. Chill out.<br />
<br />
I've given a reasonable argument as to why I believe an August release is not a smart move. And yes, 2-3 months (from a guess of a July release, which is giving them a little extra), is too long. If its August, that's 3-4 month's too long. This game SHOULD NOT BE OUT AFTER THE MOVIE. 100%. There is 0 excuse, 0 reason, 0 way's they can justify pushing it past the movie. When time and time again they've assured us that they are moving away from year-long final tiers and pushing towards more content and faster releasing content. This is the absolute DIRECT OPPOSITE. <br />
<br />
This isn't even promises. They flat out said they didn't want that to happen ever again. They told us the increased the team size, that WoD was slower because they had to get the new people accustomed and caught up to how they do things. Well guess what? It's an expansion later, and nothing has improved. In fact, there's a realistic possibility that it'll be the WORST to date.<br />
<br />
Sure, I could be wrong. I'll gladly admit it if it happens. But based on ALL PREVIOUS EVIDENCE, and everything they have told us over the last 3-4 years, this is NOT acceptable.<br />

I'm a 10 year + player too AND have the statue they sent to 10 year players to prove it. Sorry dude, you sound like a troll yourself. You above all people should know they should be releasing the content a hell of a lot faster than the shit show you're playing now. I'm glad you still find a reason to log into the game, I sadly, have not. Thus, I have canceled my subscription about 6 months ago, and honestly, I haven't looked back. The content you're playing, sorry to say it, but it feels like it should of been a major patch instead of a $60 xpac. It's beyond shit. Knowing they won't be releasing the next installment for another year is just beyond sad. However, I can assure you, I won't be tossing any money at them for another year, if by that time, I haven't forgotten about WoW completely. <br />
<br />
WoD is just horrible, and to make people suffer through it another year, is just beyond terrible.</div></div><hr />

I have no interest in PvP content. Never enjoyed WoW's mechanics in PvP environment. And Pet Battles are also wasted effort on me, I have actual Pokémon games for that shit.</div></div><hr />

Uhm... both of you do know than a year on the Gregorian calendar is 12 months, right?<br />

Given the fact that the link people have been providing has been 404'ing, I think this is another example of Blizzard screwing up and putting something sensitive on their site without protection.

<br />
I wouldn't be surprised if this is taken down at Blizzard's request.

At night, the night before they get the chance to spin their spin and show off their wares - there's no way this could have been an intentional leak.<br />
<br />
Out of context, another year long end game raid - nothing unusual; WotLK with its 12 million subs did this. But in context... specifically, the panning of WoD by players, spiking and then freefalling sub numbers...<br />

This kind of information is the making of a PR disaster, released at the wrong time, with no spin.</div></div><hr />

Something like WoW needs fresh content to thrive. I'm not particularly concerned about the wait, it's what I expeted, and frankly I'm happy about the gap if it means we get a real expansion and not another shit show like WoD. I'm just pointing out you can't compare an MMO to your average game, they are completely different.<br />
<br />
Well if the content is good the game will thrive.. for a while... You clearly see it at sub numbers, it goes up once every new expansion and then drops again. But from blizzards perspective it's the same as any game. There's no difference. They still have to do the design, programming and scripting. They basically have to make a fresh content at a rate 10x faster pace than a non mmo game since yeah, the social aspects like guilds etc matter to people. So in a way you can compare it to other games, but people are quite spoiled already and they want more faster. The only thing blizzard can do about it is either make the game harder to beat or add more collectibles like achivements etc. But most people don't want games that are too hard or takes too long to beat, they want content that is easy enough but at the same time engaging. Satisfying those people, which constitute the majority of the player base with fresh new content at a steady pace is quite a challenge I would say.</div></div><hr />

<br />
All of you who are crying like a whiny kid who wants their christmas gift as soon as it's under the tree, have actually COMPLETED the game? Hmm? I've been playing for over a decade and there's still a ton of things that I have yet to do. How many achievement points do you crybabies actually have? Personally, I only have 22,500. &amp; I'm missing a total of 318 achievements to complete the game. Mainly pet battles &amp; pvp &amp; scenario's being the biggest 3 lacking areas. <br />
<br />
So I'm going to ask again, why are all of you complaining, when someone like me who has played for an extremely long time, and still hasn't done everything this game has to offer in regards to content. bitching about this release date? Go play the game.<br />
<br />
Most people are like to waste time doing various achievements and just because there are achievements, it does not mean that the content attached to most of them is worth doing for the greater majority of players. Achievements are their for the completionist and nothing more. I somewhere in the mid 17k range and I got out every so often and do a few achievement here or there, but I would not consider them more content past the content they are already in. I don't pet battle or pvp anymore. I find pet battling to be boring and pvp in this game has not been pvp in a very long time. So there is all those achievement points that I will never ever get around to doing, because I don't enjoy doing those things. <br />
<br />
I am sure there are tons of people that play this game and could careless about achievement points, because they just play the game to have fun. Problem with people like yourself, is you think that every single person plays the game exactly like you or wants to play the game exactly like you do. There are people that only like to level and quest, maybe add a bit of raiding, maybe not. Some like doing pvp and battle pets and nothing else. There are all kinds of people playing this game all sorts of different ways and none exactly the same as the other. <br />
<br />
So you saying that their is ton of game left to do. Well maybe in your eye and for your own satisfaction, but to another person, not so much they done what they planned to do in the game and nothing more and now they are ready for more content of the same that they have completed.<br />
<br />
I should add for a lot of people, including myself I find the prospects of another 10 months or more appalling to say the least. I been spending the majority of my time the last few months leveling another batch of alts for Legion. This whole we are going to make sure not to have another very long dead zone between expansion was nothing more than a crock. They knew how soon they were going to bring that expansion out and they made WoD with the little amount of overall content that they did. <br />
<br />
Not sure how they think people are just going to hang around. People have already been doing that and some have recently come back knowing that the next expansion should be just around the corner. Well that corner is about 10 or more months away now. I have never taken a break from this game since I started playing it some 8 plus years ago, but this time around. I am looking at finally doing just that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've given a reasonable argument as to why I believe an August release is not a smart move. And yes, 2-3 months (from a guess of a July release, which is giving them a little extra), is too long. If its August, that's 3-4 month's too long. This game SHOULD NOT BE OUT AFTER THE MOVIE. 100%. There is 0 excuse, 0 reason, 0 way's they can justify pushing it past the movie. When time and time again they've assured us that they are moving away from year-long final tiers and pushing towards more content and faster releasing content. This is the absolute DIRECT OPPOSITE. <br />
<br />
This isn't even promises. They flat out said they didn't want that to happen ever again. They told us the increased the team size, that WoD was slower because they had to get the new people accustomed and caught up to how they do things. Well guess what? It's an expansion later, and nothing has improved. In fact, there's a realistic possibility that it'll be the WORST to date.<br />
<br />
Sure, I could be wrong. I'll gladly admit it if it happens. But based on ALL PREVIOUS EVIDENCE, and everything they have told us over the last 3-4 years, this is NOT acceptable.<br />
<br />
PS I'm still crazy excited for Legion, that hasn't changed.<br />
<br />
I was more referring to the fairly sizable number of posters here who ARE getting really worked up about this. Threatening unsubbing like anyone actually cares about what they do.<br />
<br />
You really can't bring the movie into this discussion though since it is completely separate from what goes on with the game. Unless someone has insider information of two completely separate teams of people (one game developer and one movie studio) collaborating on release dates, then it's just coincidence.<br />
<br />
As for what is said and what happens in the end, I guess I just don't put much weight in the former. As I've said before, unless someone here has upper management insight on how development is actually progressing (what is being worked on by how many people and for how long), then there is really nothing to be said about how long it SHOULD take. This is how long it's going to take and that is that.</div></div><hr />

Sorry that was worded poorly! haha<br />

I meant that if we assume it's an August release, it'll put us at 14 months of no new content (HFC was June). Person I quoted said year of no new content. I was just correcting him :D hahaha</div></div><hr />

When I did play, unless it awarded a mount(like a meta mount), or a particular title, or came naturally while completing other gameplay, I didn't touch most achievements. I might have been happy when I finally got &quot;We Had It All Along*Cough*&quot;, even tracked the gold achievements(which I worked on as a side effect of doing old content and farming), but running around hugging critters is not content.<br />
<br />
Half that crap is totally disconnected from skill. Retarded grinds of rep, /hug every critter, irrelevant scenarios, jump through this or that hoop - nothing like getting a high PVP rating, or doing old!Heroic/Mythic.</div></div><hr />

Can't see beta this year, given they only do about 3-4 months worth of beta. I could of seen beta starting after Blizzcon and the expansion dropping in the spring, but that is not going to happen. If we actually take what is on the poster and some sort of date to make a date out of thin air, then maybe they will give a much hard date during Blizzcon, but if this is the date they show in the presentation, then beta is not coming at the earliest of mid to late spring.</div></div><hr />

Lol who am I kidding ;D</div></div><hr />

<br />
Intersting, that this comes out days after they said they wouldn't realase subscription numbers anymore. Now we know why. This game will plummet to catastrophic numbers. I think blizzard underestimates the wisdom of its player base. We see right through this smokescreen. WoD was a flop, and most people will only give so many chances before hitting the 'off' button for good.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Couldn't possibly be because they're overhauling near every class and spec and need quite a bit more time to beta test and refine, as they're selling it as the largest class overhaul set at once.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dorothyjean</div><div class="date">2015-11-06, 03:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So many people who need to learn how to read.<br />
<br />
Keep in mind Sin that they did the same thing with WoD Release Date &quot;by or on&quot; and it was one month. Blizzard releases everything via Yearly Business Quarter's so Q3 is July, August and September so you can say people need to learn to read but you should use wisdom from WoW history.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shambulanced</div><div class="date">2015-11-06, 03:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The bumped price tag seems like a big deal now because Blizzard has squandered all the good faith that people had for them with WoD and I'm positive most people feel this way.<br />
<br />
This, pretty much.<br />
<br />
Faith in the WoW Team (not Blizz as a whole, mind you) is at an all-time low. WoD was a disappointment to most and we were told, time and again, that it was designed with less content because the goal was faster expansions, when what we wanted was the same amount of content but with fewer year-long droughts at the end.<br />
<br />
What we got was less content, poor quality content, and a similar drought anyway.<br />
<br />
So yeah, $10 is going to sting. Saying &quot;Sept 2016...MOST LIKELY EARLIER but maybe Sept guys&quot; is going to sting.<br />
<br />
Their PR is horrible, their marketing is lacking, and overall it seems things are in rough shape on the WoW team.<br />
<br />
<br />
Overwatch, on the other hand, looks superb and reports from streamers/youtubers have been quite positive.</div></div><hr />

Besides wanting to keep people out of the same areas.<br />
<br />
Incredibly frustrated about the release date assuming, and this is a big assumption, that is accurate. I doubt it is, I'd be surprised if we didn't have it before the end of Q1 next year.</div></div><hr />

They have diversified their gaming portfolio in different genres. Look, we've got Legacy of The Void -&gt; Overwatch -&gt; WoW Movie -&gt; Legion. By staggering releases, you get the masses hooked on &quot;some form of Blizzard game&quot;, minimizing complete churn due to lack of WoD content. It all makes sense now... right? Blizz hemmoraging subs now isn't as bad because they have other money makers plugging in the WoW leaks.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tj119</div><div class="date">2015-11-06, 03:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">LOL no fucking wonder they just announced they won't be reporting sub numbers.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xrocknrolla</div><div class="date">2015-11-06, 03:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Most people are like to waste time doing various achievements and just because there are achievements, it does not mean that the content attached to most of them is worth doing for the greater majority of players. Achievements are their for the completionist and nothing more. I somewhere in the mid 17k range and I got out every so often and do a few achievement here or there, but I would not consider them more content past the content they are already in. I don't pet battle or pvp anymore. I find pet battling to be boring and pvp in this game has not been pvp in a very long time. So there is all those achievement points that I will never ever get around to doing, because I don't enjoy doing those things. <br />
<br />
I am sure there are tons of people that play this game and could careless about achievement points, because they just play the game to have fun. Problem with people like yourself, is you think that every single person plays the game exactly like you or wants to play the game exactly like you do. There are people that only like to level and quest, maybe add a bit of raiding, maybe not. Some like doing pvp and battle pets and nothing else. There are all kinds of people playing this game all sorts of different ways and none exactly the same as the other. <br />
<br />
So you saying that their is ton of game left to do. Well maybe in your eye and for your own satisfaction, but to another person, not so much they done what they planned to do in the game and nothing more and now they are ready for more content of the same that they have completed.<br />
<br />
I should add for a lot of people, including myself I find the prospects of another 10 months or more appalling to say the least. I been spending the majority of my time the last few months leveling another batch of alts for Legion. This whole we are going to make sure not to have another very long dead zone between expansion was nothing more than a crock. They knew how soon they were going to bring that expansion out and they made WoD with the little amount of overall content that they did. <br />
<br />
Not sure how they think people are just going to hang around. People have already been doing that and some have recently come back knowing that the next expansion should be just around the corner. Well that corner is about 10 or more months away now. I have never taken a break from this game since I started playing it some 8 plus years ago, but this time around. I am looking at finally doing just that.<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't believe people play this game exactly like I do, you're very wrong to assume that of me. The achievement system being entirely completed is yes, for the competitionist, and yes some people play this game for only a specific niche of theirs that they enjoy. For some it's pet battles, like my mom. For others it's pvp or pve, for me it's pve and general content like quests and stuff. <br />
<br />
My entire point to the post is that this game is the biggest game in the world in regards to content. Random generated map games like D3 notwithstanding because that's just endless really. However people complaining that they aren't going to get a brand new expac until AT THE LATEST 09/2016 when they probably haven't done much the game has to offer in it's entirety is sophomoric. Furthermore, if you only play WoW for a specific niche of yours, and then you're going to complain about the release date? I feel like you have to be a special kinda stupid to do that, Blizzard doesn't and won't ever care about your own little niche that you play the game for. Ever. Personally I hate LFR and wish it was removed. I don't believe people should be able to raid unless they can actually do mechanics, hate me for that or not I don't care. Point is, this is a huge game, there's ALWAYS SOMETHING TO DO. If you've gone and completed whatever particular area of the game you play it for then you either need to find joy in another part of the game, or play a different game. You can't expect to get new content every 3 or 4 months for your own little happiness and immersion. <br />
<br />
Now all that being said, am I happy with that unconfirmed release ON OR BEFORE date? Nope. <br />
Do I care, am I going to get angry about it? Nope<br />
Why? Because I have other games to play, in case I don't get the will to do the last 300 achievements I need. R.I.P. Glad achieve.</div></div><hr />

Are they out of their fucking minds? Or do they honestly want to destroy the game. How could Legion be that far from launch with how little effort they have put into WoD.

So we're looking at a solid 8-10 more months of HFC, what the actual f*$#? lol</div></div><hr />

At least ICC was a really awesome raid. I didn't mind months and months of it. HFC feels really lame by comparison.</div></div><hr />

&quot;They&quot; also said that the end MOP (and ICC!) lull was a result of hard work on WoD, as well as the biggest team ever(tm) and blah blah blah. We all saw how that played out.</div></div><hr />
