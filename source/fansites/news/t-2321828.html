Those guilds who couldn't do it need to git gud. Challenges are there for a reason, and Blizzard shouldn't have to lower the bar just because guilds cant get coordinated enough to down the boss.<br />
<br />
Its the most difficult raid format for a reason.</div></div><hr />

That has been a thing for years, though. Even world 1000+ guilds have been dropping 1-2 healers as content get easier.</div></div><hr />

You haven't killed a Mythic boss at all in Legion. Stay out of discussions above your level.</div></div><hr />

Less than 0.1% of players have killed mythic KJ...</div></div><hr />

didnt you know the golden rule of desribing players on this forums ? anyone even barely below someone is complete utter scrub and should uninstal game imidiately and anyone even barely above someone is complete utter nolifer :)</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zenfoldor</div><div class="date">2017-10-18, 01:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My scrub heroic guild lost many players and 2 main tanks(and our second best healer) to heroic KJ, but we beat it after 107 wipes 2 weeks ago this Friday. We had a couple of 1% wipes early on that really hurt.<br />
<br />
From my anecdotal experience, a heroic KJ nerf a few weeks earlier may have saved a few rage quitters, but that said it was quite satisfying on that 108th pull. I have to do the ball in phase 3, but that's the fun part.<br />
<br />
The only other boss we really got stuck on this xpak was spellblade, and some guys in the guild were talking about how &quot;KJ was nothing to spellblade&quot; but I looked back on my DBM, and I was there every pull, and we had like 40 wipes, iirc, so they were just remembering those good time wipes more fondly, we definitely had a harder time with HCKJ than any other boss so far this xpak.<br />
<br />
We are now completing the entire heroic in 1 night and this week it will be probably about 2 hours(had been running 2 full nights for weeks, getting 1 full night of wipes on KJ and then about an hour of the first night wiping). We are moving on to mythic Friday.<br />
<br />
PS: After we got him down the first time, we went in there week 2 and got him down on the 3rd or 4th pull so I suspect he's on farm even without the nerfs for our 3rd kill this week. Biggest issues were:<br />
1. Random tank deaths<br />
2. New guys not knowing what to do(taking many wipes to train a few newcomers, armageddeons, placement, dodging ball, movement, ect)<br />
3. Boss not facing proper way and hitting raid with felclaws at random points<br />
4. Not timing transitioning properly into the dark realm</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Marrilaife</div><div class="date">2017-10-18, 01:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Go look at some logs, some have 1 healed first 3 bosses and all bosses have been done with 3 healers. First 3 bosses are easier on mythic than hc KJ was before the nerfs, but except Inquisition none of them was really nerfed, most nerfs were about Mistress, Avatar and KJ, and we're still a bit off from the HFC example where Iron Reaver mythic speedkill was done sub 1 minute. Tier is old, and tbh Legion already asks guilds to have more healers around as many bosses were 5-healed on progression, while during HFC 3 healers for everything was a standard, 4 for really healing intense bosses, I don't think I've seen 1 fight with 5 healers. Legion has also the tendency to show up bosses that are solved by 3-tank strat, so now guilds not only need to have extra healers but also a back up tank. <br />
<br />
It's probably a month until we get new raid after Blizzcon, people can have few last weeks of fun and maybe even kill some bosses they couldn't before. Even if this nerf allows them to finally kill Avatar, I'm not sure if few weeks is enough for a guild of that caliber to learn KJ, so it's mostly a consolation prize anyway. Many guilds who killed mythic Gul'dan &quot;in time&quot; for the achievement, now will not be able to do the same with KJ.</div></div><hr />
