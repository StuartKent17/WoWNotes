BLOOOOOODY hell.<br />
<br />
I'm guessing Azerite trait stacking plus the Orb.<br />
<br />
But even without the orb yeah mate that is ridiculous.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The victim had the orb, so that was quite inflated. But yes, rogue's damage is insane. I remember after nerfs during the prepatch, a rogue dealed to me a 9.5k eviscerate in a sheeting shore bg. I'm warrior (plate), and none of us had any bg buff/debuff. That was literally the half of my total health.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The Rogue had god roll, berserking, and I couldn’t tell how long the mage had the orb. Holding that orb stacks to 100% increased damage taken (maybe 200%) with 100% less healing taken.<br />
Maybe not everyone will hit that hard, but you hold that orb long enough you’re going to drop.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Tbh, there are some azerite traits for Feral that would also allow you to deal retarded damage when 3x stacked... until hotfixes that is.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You mean the Mage (very low armor count) with the orb (greatly increases damage taken) got hit by a rogue, with beserk? That's not very impressive TBH. I watched a fire mage one shot 3 flag carriers in there at the same time with meteor.</div></div><hr />
