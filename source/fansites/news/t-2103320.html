We’d like to take a moment to dispel some rumors and give some insight into certain “hidden” Artifact Appearances, as well as some general notes on how this system (and similar systems) has worked out so far in Legion.<br />
<br />
For starters, we’ve seen some rumblings around the community that the appearance for Arms Warriors was “hotfixed in.” This is not the case. The quest for that particular appearance has a daily chance to be offered in the Warrior Order Hall, and when it's active, it will be active throughout an entire region for that day. Our initial setting for that chance ended up being too conservative (and was increased in Patch 7.1), but the chance has been there every day since the expansion launched. <br />
<br />
Many of you have also been asking about the hidden appearance for Frost Death Knights. We’ve been trying to avoid giving out too much in the way of spoilers for these, but as it’s now the last one to be discovered, we figured we might as well give you guys a hint. This appearance is tied to a particular world boss, which hasn’t spawned yet. Once that boss is available, we expect the appearance to be found pretty quickly.<br />
<br />
We’ve learned a lot of important lessons about hidden content and these sorts of varied and discoverable unlocks over the course of Legion development. Some of our efforts were clearly far more successful than others. We’re going to take these lessons to heart and apply them going forward. Additionally, we’re working on a few tweaks to how the hidden artifact appearances are acquired, which will be released in a future patch, with the goal of reducing the frustration that can come from trying to chase down some of the more elusive ones.<br />
<br />
<br />
Prepare to Bring Illidan Home!<br />
Standing 24 inches tall and made of polyresin, this colorful sculpture of Illidan will make the perfect addition to your collection. The piece is sculpted by Blizzard Senior Sculptor Brian Fay and features original paint by Senior Illustrator Laurel D. Austin<br />

The great ones usually involved travel, some secrets and (occasionally) grinding. There was a sense of hunting something rare down and glee when you got it. The bad ones were either so easy they were effectively worthless (the hunter purchasable bow) or far too reliant on random once a week drops (e.g. from raid bosses or the withered training cache - which meant a lot of repeated running of something you'd quickly be tired of).<br />
<br />
Hopefully they find a balance and can fix a few of them.</div></div><hr />

I don't think you quite understand what they were describing... It had a chance to spawn for everyone in the region at once every day. The chance was however very low, so it didn't happen until whenever it actually happened, but when it did, it happened to everyone at once.</div></div><hr />

I can overlook that downtrodden posture but the colour scheme is just hideous. Part of why I think Illidan is so popular os simply because of his vivid green/purple colourng. This model has barely any trace of green on it, his tattoos/eyes aren't glowing (before you say &quot;durr glowing paint isn't real&quot; look up painting OSL) and his glaives are almost completely colourless. Don't get me started on those orange wings.<br />

He's not wrong though.<br />
<br />
It's still an impresive statue, but the colours could have been so much better. The tattoos should be much more vibrant to fit the fel magic energies, and when exactly did Illidan's wings become gaudy orange? They were always displayed as purple/black, which fits his colour scheme much better.</div></div><hr />

Illidan's tattoos are black. they glow when Illidan wants them to glow. same goes for his eyes.<br />

plus, it would look weird if you ask me.</div></div><hr />

Not really? The price got nothing to do with giving fair criticism. Sure, it'd be more forgivable if this was a cheap plastic toy or someting, but this thing will obviously be very costly. The Grommash statue was 350$ so this one will probably be around that price point, possibly a bit more.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Like most of the RNG codes from Blizzard that they need to fix. World Bosses repeating right at the start, pandaria dailies not changing (like the celestials always showing up the white tiger for a month)...<br />
<br />
Their RNG code is simple terrible.<br />
<br />
And I told people that if nobody found it, it was a world boss drop. Things not tied to anything in datamining end up as drops.</div></div><hr />

I hope they do not think for a second we believe that horseshit about &quot;Our initial setting for that chance ended up being too conservative&quot;, it was plain and simple broken as was the Frost DK one, because they stated early on that that one was one of the &quot;more fun ones&quot; to aquire. Also it magically became a Feature not a bug that you can get another hidden skin's color when you get the one you are wearing and glitch it out, after about a week of almost all the DKs sad &quot;fuck that shit&quot; and left the whole skin to rot wherever some idiot coded it in. Every single one of us sad that we tried everything, its nowhere so we wait for Soultakers and lo and behold it is on those fuckers oh how we were caught blindsided by this fun way of getting it.<br />
Final note, they blatantly lied and spat in everyones faces when they kept repeating &quot;All of them are in the game&quot; , go fuck yourselves Blizzard.</div></div><hr />

Why would you as developer make it drop from a world boss who has not spawn yet. Yeah that is not smart design and someone needs their head checked. Rare spawn is one thing but not to have spawned as of yet. That is ridiculous.<br />
<br />
Why? You don't need it for anything.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is the dumbest answer i have ever heard. If every class is able to obtain it why screw over one class. It piss poor design. It not about needing it for anything it is about being able to have it. And technically they lied about all the artifacts being in game as Frost Dk's is not. Just because it is on a weekly boss that has not spawn yet does not mean you will get the skin automatically. Then what wait another two months. PISS POOR DESIGN again by Blizzard</div></div><hr />

Like, holy shit wow I just spent 30 minutes at Soul Engine: Apocalypse and got my hidden Holy Paladin appearance whereas the Corrupted Ashbringer has you retracing steps from Vanilla, interesting NPC interactions, and is generally awesome. Shaman? All their appearances basically require the same damn grindy mob grind with sprinkled in AK gating.<br />

Wowee. Look at how interested and excited I am at getting my Enhancement hidden artifact.</div></div><hr />

There usually is. I think they don't add it until a few months after Blizzcon is no longer on sale/available. Most of my Blizzcon FoS are dated December.</div></div><hr />

Would trade you in a heart beat if I could, but then that's the nature of the beast... RNG, it makes things feel good when you do get something you've always wanted! ;D<br />

Best of luck -to us both :)</div></div><hr />

Half the time. I stop like for the pally fishing up the ret artifact item... Then in a expansion or two later for whatever reason I'll fish in that area and first cast it will RNG it to me. <br />
<br />
I guess I should just queue up as dps for a heroic or lfr and fish..... the dps queues are long enough... LOL</div></div><hr />
