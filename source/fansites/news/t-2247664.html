Fan Art - Naxxramas Trailer<br />
Hurricane is back with another trailer, this time for Naxxramas.<br />
<br />
<br />

Dev Interview<br />
Jesse Cox and Crendor had the opportunity to talk to Ion Hazzikostas recently.<br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;iframe width=&quot;900&quot; height=&quot;180&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/9QQil6jxO4w?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
There are no plans to increase the item level of items that drop from existing world bosses. World bosses are extensions of raid tiers. <br />
Dungeons are one of the big success stories of Legion. In older expansions, there was a huge spike in dungeon participation early in the expansion and then it rapidly dropped off. In Legion, through a mix of adding new dungeons, updating the difficulty baseline and rewards, as well as the Mythic Keystone system, we are seeing people to continue to dungeons as a parallel or complement to raiding. <br />
It seems very likely we will have more dragon story in the future. Certainly when you are Level 112, as you learn in the Chromie scenario, dragons are going to be very important. <br />
There are terrible void creatures out there and an unexplored set of worlds. That is something the team is looking forward to tapping into in the future. <br />
Argus would have made a monotonous setting for an expansion. It's an awesome place, but is a husk of a world that has been destroyed by the Legion. It isn't a place where we can have a bright and happy zone or civilizations that are flourishing and interesting to interact with.<br />
Draenor was a brutal and savage world, but had the Arroka and the rolling plains of Nagrand. Argus doesn't have that and wouldn't support that. <br />
Players often say they miss being a humble adventurer, rather than being a hero and champion. The story has advanced beyond that. When you are Level 90 or 100, you aren't just a faceless person anymore. You have defeated Onyxia, defeated the Lich King, defeated other great threats to the world, so you are becoming a peer to other heroes like Thrall, Jaina, and Varian. As we get stronger, the threats we face get stronger. At the same time, the team tries to keep in mind relative power scales. When we took on Deathwing, we had the assistance of the dragon aspects to make it a fair fight. <br />
On Argus, we find a Legion portal network that allows the Legion to assault other worlds. You go through these portals to Rift worlds using riftstones (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/151702-charged-riftstone) from Kil'jaeden's ship, allowing you to get a glimpse of all new planets around the cosmos. You clear out the Legion invasion force, fight a boss, do an event, and complete an objective there. This provides some variation to Argus and allows us to see some different settings. <br />
What's happening on Argus is the culmination of Azeroth's defense against the threat that the Legion poses. Could Argus be used for something else in the future? Who knows. It's an important location, the homeworld of the Draenei, a very important place, but the purpose it serves in the Legion story is defeating the Legion. <br />

Blue Tweets<br />
Just obliterated 3 pieces of pvp gear and only got 3 Echoes of Battle in total. Is this a bug?<br />
You can now obliterate Legion Season 4 Battleground-quality gear for a few Echoes. Gladiator gear is worth more. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/877605030085263360))<br />

<br />
Ghostcrawler Tweets<br />
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br />
On the matter of player experience: do you think that the average player wants a game design that is created in a manner that they immerse themselves in and don`t realize they`re dealing with gameplay mechanics, decisions and overall game design elements, or do you think that the average player prefers to face to-do mission lists, itemization tables, gameplay-oriented character decisions and interfaces that make the whole game experience feel and look like a mission control panel?<br />
This is a good question to talk about the difference between how players sometimes think about development, and how developers think about development… or at the very least, how I advocate that developers should be thinking about development.<br />
<br />
I wouldn’t approach your question in terms of what the average player wants, but instead what kind of game you as a game developer want to make. You should have a vision for your game, and goals you are trying to meet, and an experience you want players to have.<br />
<br />
The risk you run whenever you start worrying about what the average player would like (even if you are limiting that to the average player of your game) is that you can quickly to get to a least-common-denominator / designed-by-committee design. You can end up with a design that doesn’t offend anyone but doesn’t inspire anyone either. I love Dark Souls. I understand that it isn’t for everyone, and trying to make it more broadly appealing would probably greatly erode things that I love about the game (like the difficulty, hidden information, experimentation, and so on).<br />
<br />
It’s a subtle distinction perhaps, but I think the development process should not be: <br />
<br />
1) Ask players want they want<br />
2) Build what they want.<br />
<br />
Instead, it should be:<br />
<br />
1) Come up with the kind of game you are trying to make<br />
2) Ask players if your design is meeting this goal<br />
3) Iterate until it does (or until you change your goal)<br />
<br />
It’s kind of like the scientific method, where ideally you formulate a hypothesis first and then go get data.<br />
<br />
So you may just be describing two different games in your original question. If I wanted a game that rewarded exploration and experimentation (something like Breath of the Wild), then I would go for the first one (the “immersive” one.). If I wanted a game where players were supposed to log in almost every day to check out what is going on, or maybe a really competitive game where comparing achievements and avoiding wasting time were both paramount, then I’d go for your second one (”mission control panel”). Those two games might have overlap in who enjoys them, but they might attract different “average players” as well.

See, I have a problem with this. For all we've done, for all we've learned and for all we've grown a reputation with we're still tasked with delivering mail and killing boars. The only place we're relevant to our accomplishments is what's shown on our armory and to other players otherwise the game treats us as if we're the same players who rolled in to a town or city at level 1. The Demon Hunter's Order Hall NPCs are like &quot;I've sacrificed much, what have you given&quot; (or to some effect as that) and it's like.... what the hell?<br />
<br />
If you're going to make me a hero or a champion, I damnwell deserve the luxuries of such. Make custom greetings based on reputations, make custom compliments based on what we've done, give us faster rested XP generation, give us something other than a rep vendor with garbage. You see that Jaw up there? That's Deathwing the Destroyer's Jaw and the best you can do is a god damn satchel, a table rag to put on my back and antiquated mounts?<br />
<br />
I'm the man who's gonna burn their house down with lemons if they don't step up their hero worship game outside of the order hall.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">keymil</div><div class="date">2017-07-03, 01:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I kind of understand their reasoning about the impossibility of Argus being its own expansion. All other expansions had variety in the zones and many different races fighting for survival. Argus, on the other hand, is just a wasteland, a world ravaged by fel energies. Logically it would look like Broken Shore on steroids and it would be very bland and boring. People already complain 7.3 looks like Broken Shore.<br />
<br />
So as much as Argus itself is a very important world, it just doesnt serve as expansion idea in similar sense Emerald Dream doesnt. Cant wait for the invasions on different worlds tho. This is where they can go off with their imagination and different looks.</div></div><hr />

Well, you should also remember you are the one (in lore) to assist in collecting the Pillars of Creation. You are the one making contact with Prince Farondis, the one assisting great druidic being in helping Cenarius. You are the one making first contact with ancient Night elf civilisation. We are so important WE are sent to such crucial missions cause important NPC figures trust in our abilities. Of course there is sometimes this silly quest, but you should look at it as a whole, and we accomplished much on the Broken Isles. There are (in lore) also many more easy tasks that get done by avarage footmen that you just dont see.<br />
<br />
There cant only be very very important quests to do, cause in such case it creates ridiculous illusion in the world being in terrible terrible danger and us being godlike saviours. We are not. We are just the veterans and defenders of Azeroth that mosly get tasked with important missions. Much more important than a few years ago.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And based on what accomplishments should a starting Demon Hunter be worthy of respect? They aren't a storied hero of the age, they are just the poor sap who got locked up along with Illidan and now has to try and make something of the fractious bunch of ex-cons they were locked up with. There is no history of accomplishment there to make them worthy of respect. I'm sure it will come with time but lets face it, at the start of legion as a DH you are basically a nobody.<br />
<br />
Picture the scene at the end of Tomb, the DH comes home saying &quot;we did it guys, we beat Kil'Jaeden&quot; and after some snickering in the back someone says &quot;so by we you mean that you, and the bunch of heroes who beat Arthas, Deathwing, Garrosh and all their armies beat Kil'Jaeden, lets face it, they let you tag along out of niceness, they didn't really need you now did they?&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is more or less what they literally greet you with while being on your Demon Hunter inside the Order Hall. The Order Hall the player is essentially the leader of. It's like a peasant talking shit about a King inside the Keep. :/<br />

<br />
Let me rephrase it a little. I don't mean every quest should be to bring the head of a Dragonflight or to drop kick a Lich King but recognition being baked in to the game would go a long way to give us the impression that we're these heroes and champions outside of where it's required at that time. We have the quests, sure, that goes without saying as they're there in order to progress a story but the infrastructure simply doesn't cater to these events and titles which is why I drew the comparison between a fresh level 1 character and a esteemed character who has essentially saved Azeroth countless times. I want some instanced horns to blair with a greeting every time I enter the gates of Orgrimmar and I want people to talk about me like they talk about some of the Artifacts. You stand near a Blood Elf with the Felo'melorn and sometimes they're like &quot;omg that's so cool!&quot; much like with Doomhammer and Orcs. <br />
<br />
The only place you seem to be revered as a whole is within your order hall and the minimum requirement of NPCs who are hard coded to, more often than not, refer to you as &quot;champion&quot; or &quot;hero&quot; simply because they can't text-to-speech your name as shown in the chat bubbles.</div></div><hr />

<br />
IIRC, people in Ashran hubs (as well as Garrison) called you commander etc. The recognition is being able to talk to the important figures themselves, and them reffering to you by your title or name. How many people on Azeroth can talk freely with the Council of Six, let alone get some of their power? Who does Anduinn trust more when he wants YOU to escort him through the streets of Stormwind? Who else is a witness to the message from Turalyon from the Light's Heart? Or Magni communing with Azeroth herself?<br />
<br />
There is sooooo much that shows how important we are. You cant just focus on stupid quests or avarage no name npc talking shit to us (which have been a thing since the begining).</div></div><hr />

I'll try to spell it out.<br />
-WoW is a cash cow<br />
-Warcraft 4 can't logistically exist alongside the MMO (in terms of story) - unless it acts a bridge between expansions<br />
-Therefore, as long as they keep WoW going for the money, we'll never get another Warcraft RTS game</div></div><hr />

People love dungeons but before this expansion we always saw a drop off in participation.&quot; That they'd call them out and go, &quot;Do you think this is a real success or is it only because you're giving out such high rewards that people continue to do them?&quot;<br />
<br />
Slight offense meant to the devs intended because I feel like they've got their heads so far up their participation stat number that they think participation = fun, exciting, and what players want and not &quot;hey, this is the easiest path / least amount of work.&quot;</div></div><hr />

-WoW is a cash cow<br />
-Warcraft 4 can't logistically exist alongside the MMO (in terms of story) - unless it acts a bridge between expansions<br />
-Therefore, as long as they keep WoW going for the money, we'll never get another Warcraft RTS game<br />
<br />
1) Agree<br />
2) Disagree. Why does a hypothetical WC4 have to act as a bridge between expansions? It can be set at any point in time on (or off) Azeroth. <br />
3) See above. Also, RTS seems to be pretty much over as a genre, South Korean Starcrafters aside.</div></div><hr />

Per authors quotes, textures were manually upscaled, because the old ones simply can't be used in a modern day video.<br />

Are you saying every paladin player being the boss of every other paladin player and every paladin having ashbringer is a bad idea for an mmo? They dont seem to get it for some reason that its immersion breaking and bad design. Since garrisons the game is like a single player world which you happen to share with everyone who are other versions of you in the same story. Its like running around in the Normandy in Mass Effect and bumping into another Shepard. You are wrong about the dungeons though, if there was one thing that made the game better out of all the things they imported from Diablo 3: RoS was they Rift system aka keystones. Dungeons are worth replaying, kept fun because of changing affixes, give relevant rewards and always challenging regardless of skill level.</div></div><hr />

The thing is, successful MMOs function this way now. Final Fantasy XIV (the only real competition to WoW, really) has the main character as the hero of the story. Because it works. It lets people feel more connected, rather than being a faceless grunt in a giant world. Elder Scrolls does it too, albeit to a lesser extent. So does/did The Old Republic.<br />
<br />
It's just the way the genre moved.</div></div><hr />

Starcraft Remastered, Age of Empires: Definitive Edition, Civilization, Total War (Warcraft 3 remastered when they launch it) and the likes say otherwise.<br />
<br />
It might not be as popular as other genres. But RTS is always there. We people who love RTS are just waiting for a proper RTS to launch. And SC2 wasn't a proper RTS. It had many problems (mainly map and species balance, but also didn't offer much variety of strategies).</div></div><hr />

That's why I've always defended that WoW should have &quot;ended&quot; with WotLK (which was the closing chapter of the W3 ending), and that they should have started a new project to &quot;renew&quot; the gameplay/story.<br />
<br />
With a new project (be it RTS or another MMORPG called WoW2), thay could have handled this problem pretty easily... Or in a more easier, satisfying way than they've done with WoW. They could have set up the path for a new generation of adventurers who took the lead from the previous champions (that would be us), who for unknown reasons, failed to defeat the new enemies. Or long story short, it would allow Blizzard for enemies to defeat &quot;us&quot; without actually defeating us (aka making a boss impossible to kill), renewing the status completely.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree with that, but I understand why they didn't. In WotLK, WoW was at its highest point ever (12M subs) and every company on the market was working on a &quot;WoW Killer&quot;, pouring millions into new games ( remember Conan Online? ) which indicated that the genre was doing good as a whole, and the market was interested. From a pure business perspective, it would have been a stupid move to stop, and let the competition win not to mention that WoW was making Blizz/Activision a shitton of money. If you think about it that's why Blizz made Cata, which was a VERY bold move: whole world changed, plot moved in a very different direction, graphic update, etc... They would not have done it without the massive success WoW had previously. <br />
<br />
Even now, with WoW subs being relatively low, WoW makes more money each quarter than the last ( see their quarterly report to investors ). So just stopping now, and hoping the next installment of the franchise will do well, is bold. Too bold for Activision to handle.<br />
<br />
Also, let's not forget that the whole market shifted, MMORPG is a dying genre, it requires a big time investment, as well as a particular social skillset ( being able to talk, cooperate and bond with a group of strangers over microphone, and spend 4h+ per week with them wiping on bosses, on top of the overwhelming social pressure we have now with social media, etc. is not easy for everyone ) especially for the younger generation who for better or worse are used to a more fast-paced culture and communication style ( Simon Sinek has a great talk about it, go watch it :) ). So yeah, it's not just a game, it's a product, and we have to keep that in mind.</div></div><hr />

Yeah. I recently powerleveled an alt with some friends, and all we did was spam dungeons once we hit level 15.

I wasn't referring to completely stopping WoW development. I was referring that instead of launch new expansions (with all the amount of work that it implies), they should have focused on a new game, and launch some &quot;Minor&quot; patches from time to time (like a Trolls patch, for example).<br />
<br />
<br />

By implementing methods that have nothing to do with the game quality: microtransactions (ingame shop).<br />
<br />
Imagine the sh*tton of money they'd make if they made a good game with microtransactions...<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, let's not forget that the whole market shifted, MMORPG is a dying genre<br />
It's a dying genre, but WoW (and other MMOs) are not only being on green numbers, but they're providing more benefit than ever (WoW is an example)... Something's not right? (ironic question)<br />
A genre becoming &quot;minor&quot; doesn't necessarily mean it's a bad thing. ARPGs were also a big hit not so long ago, and now they've &quot;fallen to oblivion&quot;, yet still provide benefits.<br />
<br />
And well, let's not forget. Kids and young players play what it's trendy. Back when cibercafes were a thing, the trend was playing &quot;lan games&quot;, like CS, Quake or Age of Empires. Later on, the trend moved to Half-life 2, Diablo 2 and others. Then it moved to WoW and the likes, and it's now set mainly in MOBAs, with LoL and DotA as most played MOBA games (with over 100M players).<br />
The only genre that has been always &quot;alive&quot; (in the sense you're using), is the FPS games. There's always been at least one FPS with enough players to keep the genre as &quot;Popular&quot;. Be it Counter Strike, Quake, Wolfenstein, Battlefield, Call of Duty or the recent Overwatch.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I did not misunderstand, but making a game and an expansion are very VERY different things. An expansion does NOT require a brand new graphic engine, re-thought gameplay, new models, re-thought UX and UI, redesigned server structure, way more marketing than an expansion, etc. And you need to get ALL those things right, because you're Blizzard/Activision and it's expected of you ( and you want to make money, so you need a good game ). And you're suggesting a separate team working on minor patches too... Not saying your idea is bad, I actually agree with you, a new game after WotLK would have been awesome, but I worked for big 'modern' companies, and the amount of work we think is needed for anything is almost always twice as much if not more than that.<br />
Let's not forget than humans work there, with hierarchy, corporate pressure, differences of opinion and god knows what else ( and tbf, some of my friends worked for Blizz, and it seems like an awesome place to work at, but still... ).<br />
<br />
Yes, they are making money with micro-transactions that do not disturb the gameplay in any way, so, fair game I say. And they did make a good game with micro-transactions, it's called Hearthstone and they are printing money ^^. No, seriously, as I said, making a new game, especially one that is supposed to be replayable as shit and on a scale like WoW vanilla was at least, is a HUGE investment in terms of time and money and also a HUGE gamble. <br />
<br />
Making money does not mean it's not dying. It just means it's good at making money. And that makes total sense actually, they have less server costs as population lowers, but the players that's left are the most dedicated ones, or the ones just starting out ( buying all the expansions, etc. ), so they spend more money than the average joe. Less costs, more money going in : benefit going up. We're just forgetting that they're also optimizing a lot of stuff behind the scenes ( optimizing server load and bandwidth cost, optimizing payement flows, adding revenue sources ( WoW Token ) etc... ) that makes them a lot of money. Also, you never evaluate any sector by just the amount of money it produces. An example would be oil. Still makes a SHITTON of money, but they're going to die out and soon. Many other sectors and industries are facing or will face similar problems as automation comes along too.<br />
<br />
And yes, kids play what's popular, I very much agree, but as I said, MMOs require a very specific time commitment and social mindset. Do you think it's a coincidence that MOBAs, Card games and mobile games are the most popular genres right now? It's really not, we socially move towards a 'swipe right/left' world, with comfort and availability being the prime concerns ( and i'm not talking about Tinder only, but just the convenience business in general, like Uber, Deliveroo, Amazon Echo, Spotify, etc ). It's the same for games: click on a button, get paired up with people, play for a set amount of time, then leave. It's entertainment on demand which does not mix well in a Role Playing Game where most of the fun, by definition AND design is making your fun be it on tabletop RPGs or online in MMOs. So, yeah, as we evolve as a society ( and we are evolving quickly: just ten years ago, facebook was not a thing, neither were smartphones ) and our entertainment ( games, movies, shows, etc ) are evolving with us :)</div></div><hr />

An expansion does NOT require a brand new graphic engine, re-thought gameplay, new models, re-thought UX and UI, redesigned server structure, way more marketing than an expansion, etc.<br />
But they end up tweaking the game engine, rethinking the gameplay (specially talents), remodelling their existing models, and redesigning the server structure (cross-realm, connected realms)... In the end, I'm suspecting they're even investing more efforts in &quot;maintaining&quot; the old game than they would have needed for making a brand new game. In fact, it's common in IT that old software reaches a point that keeping it up-to-date is way more laborious than making a new 2.0 version of it.<br />
<br />
Just think a little about what they're always saying: that WoW's developing team is bigger than it ever was. Do you really think it's because content pops out faster? No. It actually means their software is outdated, and to actually pop something decent, they have to invest an insane amount of resources in taking them out. Sure the new spell animations are way better than they were in 3.3.5. But at what cost? Adapting the game engine to support DX11 was also a headache I'm sure took them a lot of time and people to solve. Or even making the 64-bit client.<br />
<br />
All those things could have been easily solved with a brand new game engine, like the one they're using for Overwatch.<br />
<br />
<br />
And that makes total sense actually, they have less server costs as population lowers,<br />
Let me doubt that. WoW's population was cut to half (compared to the end of WotLK/beginning of Cataclysm) last time they showed subscriptions, yet the amount of active servers remained the same... At least until they &quot;updated the hardware&quot; prior to Legion. The server costs remained the same, because they only increase when they need to deploy new servers, and only decrease when they take them out, which as far as we all know, they've not done in like 10 years maybe.<br />
<br />
<br />

So, yeah, as we evolve as a society ( and we are evolving quickly: just ten years ago, facebook was not a thing, neither were smartphones ) and our entertainment ( games, movies, shows, etc ) are evolving with us :)<br />
You're forgetting those games also are time demanding and require teamskills (if that's what you mean with social mindset). Getting into a X division in a MOBA or FPS requires effort and time investment. I'd say even more than getting to mythic raiding today OR raiding in Vanilla. Getting to do it in a &quot;multiplayer queue&quot; requires way more social skills than raiding (either you're a pro at social skills or the team soon falls apart due to toxicity).<br />
<br />
If you play games just to pass time or for fun (like being in a bus/train or because you get easily bored doing the same thing for longer than let's say 1 hour), any game is good enough.<br />
<br />
