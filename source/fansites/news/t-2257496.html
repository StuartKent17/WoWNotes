Not on Tyrannical it's not. Meph still does an unbelievably high amount of damage with grevious + tyrannical + dark solitude. We won't see that wombo combo for several weeks, but that place is still pretty killer at high stones.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My point was, CoEN bosses were even harder than Upper Kara, yet they nerfed Upper and left CoEN alone. Thought that was odd. <br />
<br />
Of course if you have a good grp you can still plow through there, but the bosses there are unarguably tougher than any other dungeon.</div></div><hr />

They would be sheathed right if the glaives swapped position, left hand glaive on the right on your back and vice versa. It's not really a problem they may want/care about fixing.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
They have already nerfed CoEN 3 times. Everyone was wondering why they nerf CoEN and not Upper (or lower) Kara. Now they did.<br />
<br />
Curator is not a tuning issue, just a &quot;play mechanics correctly&quot; issue.<br />
<br />
Aran's problem was the overlap of abilities, not the abilities themselves: Flame Wrath plus this regular flame debuff was basically not healable any more on higher difficulties. This should be resolved now.<br />
<br />
The worm always was the biggest problem, especially on tyrannical. I remember playing an 18 a couple months ago where soaking 1 orb and cleansing it oneshot you. And that was not tyrannical. <br />
<br />
Not really sure why the last boss was nerfed. That one has never been a problem. <br />
<br />
Glad they nerfed chess, because that was always just a senseless shitfest on fortified</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's nice. My bro and I have played WoW since 2005, and both got our mog on DHs. I didn't notice but he immediately noticed and told me &quot;huh, the glaives don't sheathe like the original glaives do.&quot; I then realized that the Warglaives mog was sheathing as a &quot;Glaive&quot; weapon like the other DH mogs. I then came to the conclusion with him when talking about it &quot;its either intended to sheathe like a glaive and not the sword version, or it could be an oversight&quot;<br />
<br />
Turns out my bro was right. It wasn't intended. Good fix.</div></div><hr />

SWOTR you could be the Sith.... really you missed this? Wildstar you could be the &quot;bad guys&quot; the other faction? LOTRO.... how did you miss the fact you could be an orc, warg, spider, etc? <br />
<br />
&quot;BAD GUYS&quot; is a relative term anyway. Also if you think WOW is the only MMO out there you can play the &quot;bad races&quot; you really have a narrow look at MMOs or have an agenda.</div></div><hr />

Not sure what &quot;agenda&quot; there is to be had, but alright, other MMO's allow you to play ugly races. One learns something new every day. <br />
<br />
Doesn't change my opinion that the Horde and WoW allows for some of the most unique &quot;ugly&quot; races though, such as Tauren and Undead, after having looked through the races of those games.</div></div><hr />
