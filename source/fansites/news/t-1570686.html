True. and if im reading patch notes correctly they added both, Fury and Arms Devastate and Revenge. I can hardly wait to see the changes as soon as servers went up. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Personally they should keep that sort of difficulty for challenge modes. A slightly more nerfed version for heroics and of course a fairly easier version for end game normal/leveling up normal. That way all player bases have something in terms of difficulty for the dungeons. My opinion only of course :)</div></div><hr />

There will be challenge modes, if the 5-mans are too easy for you, you can always aim for server best gold times for example.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">WillFeral</div><div class="date">2014-08-12, 07:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">WTF? I'm on beta and have been testing dungeons and no they arent too hard and punishing, the people that play this game on a constant basis and have stuck with this game for years call it fun and challenging, the players that come and go and play casual for a month or 2 and disappear for 6 months call it too hard and needs to be easier so i can clear it all because I won't be around long. Sadly Blizzard gives in to those M.I.A. casual players and makes all content a joke and ends up forcing the long time players to get sick of it all and leave. Maybe Blizzard is terrible at math and doesn't see that they have lost 50% of their player base since the end of WotLK... yea that's 50% which equals 6 million ppl which equals $90 million dollars a month lost and just over 1 billion dollars annually. <br />
<br />
Did you see how they had that huge marketing idea with the whole chopper mount and still caved and added the losing mount to the game which to many it's no big deal and just a dumb mount but to ppl who see things for what they really are we see it is as just another thing Blizzard did to add to that list of things that makes us distrust in their company and in long term that list gets too big for some and they just walk away from this game. it amazes that a company can lose over 1 billion dollars annually mainly in part by them ruining the game on so many levels and could easily be fixed just by actually listening to the players for once but instead are so arrogant and refuse to admit to their own failures. The numbers don't lie unlike many of those guys that type in blue text on the forums. ;)<br />
<br />
And yes I know not everyone that has left the game is for the reasons I mentioned, I understand some leave for personal reasons or the game just wasn't really for them but I guarantee the majority if asked would reply with what I have mentioned.<br />
So go ahead some of you and be the Blizzard White Knight and just flame away but I'm just trying to get my point across and I'm just not really that great at doing things like that, I hope most of you understand what I'm trying to say. This is not a QQ post but instead just me trying to point out what's really wrong with this game.</div></div><hr />

That's gameplay. It's certainly possible to have too many mechanics, but that's more of a clarity issue where complexity prevents an encounter from being readily understood or processed. But making content accessible shouldn't and doesn't mean removing interesting gameplay.&quot;<br />
<br />
When you tune down content so a group of 5 year olds can clear it you are removing interesting gameplay for many players... If standing a fire does 10 damage every 3 seconds and the healer has a hot on you that ticks for 1000 every 2 seconds I don't call that fire a mechanic and is far from interesting.<br />
Yes I exaggerate but it has been like this for a few expansions now. The whole leveling experience is a big joke and most heroics since WotLK are also way too easy which makes them boring. It's not interesting to avoid damage that doesn't hurt, it's not interesting to zerg through and skip mechanics.<br />
<br />
I get that people don't want to wipe a lot but I also get that these tuned down dungeons are extremely boring for experienced players. Just give us another option, a harder difficulty that rewards more experience, so everyone can have fun leveling...<br />

<br />
There will be challenge modes, if the 5-mans are too easy for you, you can always aim for server best gold times for example.<br />
<br />
Oh great stuff! So I have to pay € 60 for an expansion and € 13 a month to level through boring dungeons then gear up through piss easy (see MoP... WoD heroics will probably be better but I really doubt it's good enough after seeing the thousands of ridiculous nerfs in the past) heroic versions of these dungeons and then I can do the same dungeons again on the appropiate difficulty. No thank you, I rather go do something else.<br />
Server best gold times, rofl. You should try putting yourself in the situation of an experienced/good player, a challenge mode or mythic mode at the end of the game doesn't cut it anymore for a 10 year old game you are paying so much for.</div></div><hr />

&quot;dwarfMaleFacesInProgressNotDoneV2.jpg&quot;... Come on people,- read the damn notes.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
&quot;I do want to note, though, that &quot;having mechanics&quot; isn't a problem. That's gameplay. It's certainly possible to have too many mechanics, but that's more of a clarity issue where complexity prevents an encounter from being readily understood or processed. But making content accessible shouldn't and doesn't mean removing interesting gameplay.&quot;<br />
<br />
When you tune down content so a group of 5 year olds can clear it you are removing interesting gameplay for many players... If standing a fire does 10 damage every 3 seconds and the healer has a hot on you that ticks for 1000 every 2 seconds I don't call that fire a mechanic and is far from interesting.<br />
Yes I exaggerate but it has been like this for a few expansions now. The whole leveling experience is a big joke and most heroics since WotLK are also way too easy which makes them boring. It's not interesting to avoid damage that doesn't hurt, it's not interesting to zerg through and skip mechanics.<br />
<br />
I get that people don't want to wipe a lot but I also get that these tuned down dungeons are extremely boring for experienced players. Just give us another option, a harder difficulty that rewards more experience, so everyone can have fun leveling...<br />
<br />

<br />
Oh great stuff! So I have to pay € 60 for an expansion and € 13 a month to level through boring dungeons then gear up through piss easy (see MoP... WoD heroics will probably be better but I really doubt it's good enough after seeing the thousands of ridiculous nerfs in the past) heroic versions of these dungeons and then I can do the same dungeons again on the appropiate difficulty. No thank you, I rather go do something else.<br />
Server best gold times, rofl. You should try putting yourself in the situation of an experienced/good player, a challenge mode or mythic mode at the end of the game doesn't cut it anymore for a 10 year old game you are paying so much for.<br />
<br />
No, you don't HAVE to do anything,- don't like it; don't pay. It's rather simple.</div></div><hr />

Was really fun to play harder dungeons in beta (for 5 players) again. <br />
For normal dungeons it might be overtuned, because i've seen a lot of randoms that couldn't handle the mechanics on normal.<br />
<br />
=&gt; I'm hoping they are making those heroic dungeons a bit harder and normal a bit easier. Those are supposed to be cleared with every random group.<br />
(Would like a mix of Wotlk and BC heroic dungeons. More mechanics than bc, but difficulty tuned as hard as bc. They should be as short as wotlk dungeons, because you can run more dungeons if you want to play longer or only one dungeon, if you havn't much time.)</div></div><hr />

Also, I'm not sure if I like that shield. As someone who has had Bulwark since TBC on my warrior I absolutely love it the way it is. I definitely appreciate them upgrading iconic items to look better...just not sure if that one actually does.<br />

Soon to come in next expansion after WoD: changing design, so you'll have one raid instance with 2 bosses, but with 25 different difficulties!<br />
Yes! That means you get to have '50 different raid encounters'!!!</div></div><hr />

I would pretty much like it if they create a new type of mount like they did for the Blizz store instead of a recolored fire hawk used in cataclysm.Don't get me wrong i like this mount,but i think for an achievement of 250 mounts owned we should have something that stands out.<br />
i remember back in Cata when we had beta builds on mmo champ we had 3 types of fire hawks (yellow/purple/beryl).They chose to put in the game yellow and purple and they scratched beryl from their plan.Now they give it to us.Doesn't seem nice idk..</div></div><hr />

Those days IMHO the beryl firehawk was never planned as a mount on its own. Instead, the green textured one was (and IS) put into game for another case, which ever worked since then and still is working: Mount on your Pure Firehawk just after you summoned your Disgusting Oozeling. With the de-buff you get by the pet (&quot;Oozeling's disgusting aura&quot;) your Pure Firehawk appears green. (* unfortunately, the buff vanishes as soon as you lift into the air)<br />
Wondering if this will still work when the Beryl/Felflame Firehawk will be an official mount.</div></div><hr />

Really? A mount that's been useable in betas since 2011? I mean, sure it looks neat, but if I put in the dedication to get 250 of the little buggers, I should get something unique, amazing and just cool!<br />
<br />
NOT something we've seen for 3.5 years! :( <br />

The kite mounts were at least neat, even if they were the flight-point mount in the zone, but this just feels... lazy. And uncaring.</div></div><hr />
