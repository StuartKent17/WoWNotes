Two news for the price of one today, we're updating with a few information about upcoming changes for Shamans and Warlocks !<br />
New beam graphics<br />
Also as a side note Mind Flay is getting an upgraded beam graphic! (Warlocks will be getting all new beams too, including Chain Heal for Shamans) (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/6/9679739074-spriest-dps-impression-at-l80.html))<br />

Shadow Power changes<br />
Still some work to do. We're going to be changing Shadow Power to 100% bonus crit damage to be consistent with other classes, also doing some other tweaks. We have a bit more work to do with all classes DPS numbers. <br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/24x24/shaman.jpg Shaman (Skills List (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=660) / Talent Calc. (8905) (http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?shaman))<br />
Spectral Transformation replaced<br />
We're going to be dumping Spectral Transformation. We decided we weren't cool with the Shaman's Ghost Wolf being too close to a core Druid iconic ability. What will replace it is a deep Enhancement Talent that will cause your Earthbind totem to clear all snares each time it pulses on you and all nearby friendly targets. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/8/9679952778-delay-on-ghostwolf-break.html))<br />
<br />
Shaman DPS a lot lower than expected<br />
A lot of tuning still has to be done, but it's safe to say your DPS is a lot lower than what should be expected. All DPS classes/specs after we are done tuning should yield a pretty similar DPS with similar gear/&quot;min/max&quot; speccing. It's going to take a bit of time until we reach that goal, though. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/8/9679909495-feelings-on-shamans-after-completing-naxx25.html))<br />
<br />
Maelstrom Weapons changes<br />
We will have it proc from Windfury soon. Also we're going to allow it to also allow you to cast heals with Maelstrom procs (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/8/9679752093-maelstorm-weapon.html))<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/24x24/warlock.jpg Warlock (Skills List (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=680) / Talent Calc. (8905) (http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?warlock))<br />
Corruption - Base instant cast<br />
We're going to make Corruption base instant cast. The Improved Corruption talent will now increase Corruption's damage by 4/8/12/16/20%. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/9/9679892704-improved-corruption.html))<br />
<br />
Ruin and Devastation changes<br />
In an upcoming build we are changing Ruin to a 5-point talent. However, it will swap places with Devastation. Devastation will become a 1-point talent (5% spell crit). This will be a minimal change to the Destruction Warlock, while opening up Ruin to other builds without having them sacrifice their 51-point talents. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/9/9679802649-aff-haunt-vs-ruin.html))<br />
<br />
Metamorphosis changes - details<br />
We recently re-designed Metamorphosis for an upcoming build. Some changes:<br />
<br />
- It will no longer remove your pet (your pet remains)<br />
- It increases your armor by 600%, up from 360%<br />
- It increases all your damage by 40%<br />
- You can still cast your regular Warlock spells<br />
- You gain access two a few new unique Demon Form abilities that can only be used in Demon Form<br />
<br />
Among some other improvements. It will be changed back to a 5-minute cooldown, however (with a 45 second duration). With the changes to Ruin, you can also get Metamorphosis and Ruin in a build if you wish. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/9/9679801199-mirror-image--metamorphosis.html))<br />
<br />
Pandemic<br />
Going to be changing the visual and some other aspects of the talent soon, not going to have the Shadow Bolt graphic (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/9/9679630560-pandemic--not-currently-working.html))</div></div><hr />

And the whole &quot;Shadow can crit&quot; thing, made me unsure whether to spec Holy or Shadow in WotLK :S A nice change, as it can be boring, without some crits. I hope the beam graphic will look cool though</div></div><hr />

This is a pretty decent change, and now that Meta won't suck it's clear that it's not just because they were worried about it competing with Ruin. Cool. Now to make it effect Pandemic. &gt;_&gt; *drools* Meta I was dreading putting points in for anything other than walking around Dalaran, but now, assuming Demo will scale which seems to be getting worked on along with Aff scaling I have a hard spec choice to make. I love that we finally get a dps cooldown.<br />

<br />
no WL never will be overpowered...<br />
<br />
we need to buff the WL .. like:<br />
<br />
- It will no longer remove your pet, you will get 3 of them<br />
- It increases your armor by 6000%, up from 360%<br />
- It increases all your damage by 4000% only for 5 hours<br />
- You cast your regular Warlock spells instantly without loosing Mana<br />
- The causing Threat is reduced by 99,9%<br />
<br />
that will be &quot;normal&quot; or ? .. I think the should install some melee tanking skills 4 the WL... and soon there will be a normal 25 WL Raid.<br />
<br />
but never call the WL overpowered... never..<br />
<br />
sry but for me World of Warlock i mean warcraft becomes more and more a bad joke...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Peacemoon</div><div class="date">2008-09-10, 01:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Something for enhancement shaman to think about:<br />
<br />
Ghostwolf only works outdoors, does not work in dungeons or other indoor areas<br />
Ghostwolf only affects yourself, where as this totem will effectively &quot;cleanse&quot; all snares from your group(possible raid?)mates meaning greater survivability for your team mates.<br />
<br />
I think this change is better for Shaman, and will give you a lot more interesting stuff to think of to set aside good shaman from bad shaman. There is no excuse for enhancement shaman to let their healers get snared and killed.<br />
<br />
As for warlocks, baseline corruption is about damn time!<br />
+40% damage on Metamorphis sounds overpowered on a class already good at damage but I will reserve judgement.<br />
<br />
Im looking forward to more holy priest changes though, Holy Nova for instance is a complete waste and must be the most useless talented spell now. Time for an update or rethink, Blizz ;)</div></div><hr />

earthbind is killed within first 2 seconds of its duration, making it pretty bad change, since most of snares are simply spamable, as opposed to 15s CD of earthbind</div></div><hr />

Yep... looks like all the nice (and sorely needed) Shaman buffs are getting rolled back and the Warlock and Druid buffs are marching on. Kinda like deja vu all over again...<br />

to be honest, i no longer care about this lock spell being a bit OP, because mages will kill demon form with mirror images. can't wait.<br />

And as for the maelstrom buff well... considering what they did to lava burst does it really matter anymore? Sure its gonna be nice for a free heal but for pve its hardly going to make our dps much better specially when you consider what we are going to have to give up to make our dps even slightly viable.<br />
<br />
Oh and on a completely unrelated subject I hope there going to start putting hit on Huntard gear because we are going to start needing it after Wotlk with them taking our 3% hit talent out pfft.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well stoneclaw was suppose to protect our totem ... but stonclaw is also earth, so it can never protect earthbind.<br />
But well it is one snare removal each 15 sec + wolves ... so we might spend less time watchign other classes kite us to death.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">hosehead</div><div class="date">2008-09-10, 03:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Gotta love it. I can't wait for all these casters to talk about those OP Rogues - if Blizz ever gets around to actually doing anything with them. Q_Q ;-)<br />
<br />
Lots of crazy updates for casters. I would love to see some energy buffs, with all the mana-reworking that's been going on. And I'm not talking about changing the energy update frequency. I'm talking about giving us a totem or paladin buff that restores energy, much like it feeds back mana or rage. &quot;NOT ENOUGH ENERGY&quot;.<br />
<br />
WotLK looks very exciting, as does the upcoming 'tweener content patch. Can't wait to see dailies @ 80, and any word on existing dailies just stickin' around for ppl 70-80?<br />
<br />
I assume the Shattered Sun Offensive (Quel'danas') dailies are over? <br />
<br />
Will the lvl 80 dailies be PvP focused, a la Nagrand Halaa, Terokkar Towers? <br />
<br />
Or will there be lvl 80 (ice)fishing daily, as well as a 70 fishing daily? <br />
<br />
I'll check out Els-Anglin' to be sure, but are they still doing the fishing tourney? I haven't even bothered trying it, and I wouldn't mind my chance at a rare fishing pole. If they kill the tournament @ 3.0+, that leaves me very little time 'tween now and then!<br />
<br />
I do that fishing daily every day I play and still have yet to obtain one of those Bratz Crocolisks. I wager I won't even have it by 80 ;-)<br />
<br />
Nice to see more class updates, but I hope they're busy buffin' Rogues. Maybe an ability that makes 10 rogues that all attack your target, each with their own energy pool, or a mode that turns a Rogue into Gruul.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">illdrans</div><div class="date">2008-09-10, 03:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">sure blizzard do really how to keep us happy (not)<br />
<br />
removing our spectral transformation meaning that our wolves can be fear, stun and all other things work on them so therefore unless u r fighting a group of no cc at all in arena otherwise they are not very useful, as well as we get snare as usual we can't get out of it unless we use the trinket.<br />
<br />
now new earthbind affect the whole group, but when do u ever see a group of 10 or 5 get snare at the same time? not only that they is a range limited of how far this totem can affect while GW can be use in arena god no how many time which can save our ass from being kill by warriors, boomkin. <br />
<br />
and 1 more thing spectral transformation wasn't made for dungoen rather is for pvp n arena the only place u can't use GW is probably WSG HQ, and AV boss room other than that is very useful.</div></div><hr />

According to how Tremor works, the range of totems changed to 30yrds, it might be very nice. For sure it won't be as good as a inta snare breaker and that change how Enhan will play in PvP, but not too bad.<br />

Now instead of charging and be ready to swap form, you'll have to charge, got snared, put totem down, charge again, etc. <br />

I can't wait for all these casters to talk about those OP Rogues - if Blizz ever gets around to actually doing anything with them. Q_Q ;-)<br />
<br />
Lots of crazy updates for casters. I would love to see some energy buffs, with all the mana-reworking that's been going on. And I'm not talking about changing the energy update frequency. I'm talking about giving us a totem or paladin buff that restores energy, much like it feeds back mana or rage. &quot;NOT ENOUGH ENERGY&quot;.<br />
<br />
WotLK looks very exciting, as does the upcoming 'tweener content patch. Can't wait to see dailies @ 80, and any word on existing dailies just stickin' around for ppl 70-80?<br />
<br />
I assume the Shattered Sun Offensive (Quel'danas') dailies are over? <br />
<br />
Will the lvl 80 dailies be PvP focused, a la Nagrand Halaa, Terokkar Towers? <br />
<br />
Or will there be lvl 80 (ice)fishing daily, as well as a 70 fishing daily? <br />
<br />
I'll check out Els-Anglin' to be sure, but are they still doing the fishing tourney? I haven't even bothered trying it, and I wouldn't mind my chance at a rare fishing pole. If they kill the tournament @ 3.0+, that leaves me very little time 'tween now and then!<br />
<br />
I do that fishing daily every day I play and still have yet to obtain one of those Bratz Crocolisks. I wager I won't even have it by 80 ;-)<br />
<br />
Nice to see more class updates, but I hope they're busy buffin' Rogues. Maybe an ability that makes 10 rogues that all attack your target, each with their own energy pool, or a mode that turns a Rogue into Gruul.<br />

Still some work to do. We're going to be changing Shadow Power to 100% bonus crit damage to be consistent with other classes, ???<br />

Ok I know SP need some loveing totally understand that( I have always thought they only have 2 real dmg spells, mind flay and Mindblast).<br />
But 100% bonus crit dmg is only to find at frost mage and warlock side ( and that means both sahdow and fire spells via warlocks)<br />
But now as I am a fire mage wtf is burnout a tier 10 (i think ) 50 crit dmg AND 5 % more cost on spells as if fire mage dont have mana problem before <br />

Drop totem, snare removed, totem dies 1-2 sec later (marco-wand, macro-pet, etc), snare reapplied, 12 sec till it can be dropped again. How much closer can an enh shaman get in the 2-4 seconds he is snareless?<br />

Well, you have Burnout AND Ignite. And consider that the bonus crit damage is only 50% - so a crit with Ruin or another 100% crit damage bonus deals 200% damage. Ignite alone deals 150% plus another 40% of that for a total of 210% bonus damage.</div></div><hr />

Do you mean that it simply updates the display at a faster rate? *But still generates the same amount of energy? *Or did they actually tweak it beyond that..<br />

<br />
<br />
Every single time a mage uses frost nova.<br />
<br />
And your totems' range is 30 yards now. Just put it around a pillar and you're good. Only the pet classes will be able to get rid of your totem then. I.E. 2 classes out of 10.<br />
<br />
Besides, even with a macro, you get a snare break AND force them to detarget you for at least a global cooldown. All you shamans should remember you can snare them too, AND go ghost wolf instantly during that time.<br />
<br />
If you wand to kill the totem, that means you stand in place for at least 1.5 seconds, with the shaman in ghost wolf, unsnared, running towards you.<br />
<br />
An instant cast spell has a large mana cost, pets have to take time to walk to it. And if you use the pet, that means it's not on the healer, which means he can drink.<br />
<br />
Don't forget enh shamans have the biggest and easiest burst in the game. If you could stay on clothies forever without being snared, you would kill them in about 10 seconds, through heals.<br />

The time it takes to wand the totem is the time it takes for us to frost shock, we hit ghost wolf by the time they're ready for the next attack. Also, mages, hunters and warlocks don't need to waste a GCD whent hey ahve /petattack<br />

Yes, brilliant. The problem with EB totem is the same problem BoF has.... it's so easy to remove and it's a 1 trick pony. Most classes have an easy means of resnaring their opponents after the break, then we wait 15s again to do it. What's more fun is putting down EB totem and watching them fear my team.</div></div><hr />

We recently re-designed Metamorphosis for an upcoming build. Some changes:<br />
<br />
- It will no longer remove your pet (your pet remains)<br />
- It increases your armor by 600%, up from 360%<br />
- It increases all your damage by 40%<br />
- You can still cast your regular Warlock spells<br />
- You gain access two a few new unique Demon Form abilities that can only be used in Demon Form<br />
<br />
Right now with armor from arena sets and demon armor buff it is possible to get around ~3k armor <br />
If we multiply this x6 it gives ~20k armor (-65% physical damage reduction)<br />
-15% damage shared with pet with soul link <br />
-10% physical damage taken if the pet is voidwalker <br />
-----------------------------------------------------<br />
= -90% physical damage taken for 45 sec enough to pwn a rogue I guess +healthstone :P<br />

<br />
Simply looking at raw numbers (using a 100 dmg DD spell) between 5/5 Ruin and 5/5 Devastation:<br />
15% crit with Ruin vs. 20% crit w/o --&gt; 115 vs 110 (Ruin is 4.5% better)<br />
25% crit with Ruin vs. 30% crit w/o --&gt; 125 vs 115 (Ruin is 8.9% better)<br />
Ruin is slightly better, not to mention it scales better with gear level.<br />
<br />
But now, let's take a look at collateral damages:<br />
Demonology tree rely more on high crit rate than big crits: your demon scale on your crit rate, and doesnt benefit from Ruin.<br />
Affliction tree now have the great Pandemic talent, which includes it's own Ruin effect for UA and Corruption, making Devastation more welcome.<br />
<br />
In my opinion, all in all, the talent swap doesnt look like a good idea (as is).<br />
<br />
<br />
NB: It is funny enough to note that by modifying the destruction tree, the only unaffected spec is destruction ;D</div></div><hr />

It is amazing for affliction locks. This and Pandemic could quite possibly make affliction warlocks a contender in end game 25 mans, which would be a pleasant change.</div></div><hr />

Although the 5% crit to destruction spells obviously doesn't help pandemic proc either, so I guess at least it will help sb spam</div></div><hr />

No update for every single class' spec in new, innovative ways that make the game obscenely easy while promising challenging dungeons and dynamic PvP abilities that will re-define that which is the World of Warcraft?<br />
<br />
I demand more attention upon my class, their abilities, and where I will be in a raid so that I can still compete with others but easily display myself as superior in every way.<br />
<br />
I demand more attention upon my class' abilities in the PvP-regard, so that while I am in said raids I can safely queue for arenas and happily attain a higher rating than everyone else.<br />
<br />
Blizzard must give my class a polish, new look, and revamped system that brings a fun game to me (the current game is a simple 2-button system, no matter my class, but I'm still awesome).<br />
<br />
Blizzard must show constant feedback to my class so that I can know that the developers are interacting with me, since I understand and play this game and my class far better than they do.<br />
<br />
If these changes do not go through within the next 10 seconds, or if a developer who sees this (because I know they all secretly listen to my advice, and you should too) does not forward my post to 50 of his co-workers, I will quit my account and [b]NEVER return to WoW. I will instead play AoC (which is far better) or WAR (which is even more far better) or Hello Kitty Island Adventure (which is the most awesomest), because WoW in TBC has fallen to pieces and WotLK's only hope is me, it's saving grace, if they would only listen.<br />

If we multiply this x6 it gives ~20k armor (-65% physical damage reduction)<br />
-15% damage shared with pet with soul link <br />
-10% physical damage taken if the pet is voidwalker <br />

= -90% physical damage taken for 45 sec enough to pwn a rogue I guess +healthstone :P<br />

Well I can't wait if this goes live to see some rogues crying in warlock forums ;D ;D ;D<br />

some how a plate wearing warlock with a 40% damage buff and a few unique meta spells just seems like TOO much....even for warlocks<br />
<br />
seems like a really fun talent to have, but I think It still needs some sorting out</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Glacialforce</div><div class="date">2008-09-11, 03:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow I figured they were going to nerf imp holy concentration for priests but how do you go from 1 talent point giving already 4% increase to 3 talent points giving a total 3%. That alone was the deciding factor of that tree but at least serendipity was greatly improved in an attempt to balance it out. <br />
<br />
Nothing is set in stone so im not gana get in an uproar until the release the final specs for Wotlk. But how they hav the specs now discipline priests are much better at being able to consistently keep up heals while maintaining a fantastic regen system while holy replies on chance to replenish mana and gain free spell casts. <br />
<br />
Yeah, the 51 holy tree talent is good but pain suppression + shield accomplishes around 60% of what it does. I mean with a solid PvE dis priest spec your shield will have a base of absorbing 2230 damage and with a 15% talent increase will increase it to 2564.5 and then with the talent borrowed time and say with spellpower at something like 1250 will increase it to 3064.5. Plus renewed hope is in a way disciplines answer to test of faith/holy concentration. This is because it increases crit chance while the target has weakened soul meaning that with a crit heal will trigger the aegis which in turn because of rapture will return mana you never spent.<br />
<br />
Now there is alot to consider but the most important thing to consider is how important the mana regen system will work, how long boss fights will last, and the importance of plus healing because +healing is worthless when ur at zero mana. I mean enjoy the 51 holy talent guardian because you have no divine spirit. Because of the word changing of rapture as well effects the entire build but thats alot of math im not willing to get into before a release. <br />
<br />
Also lol dispersion for Shadow priests.</div></div><hr />

The time it takes to wand the totem is the time it takes for us to frost shock, we hit ghost wolf by the time they're ready for the next attack. Also, mages, hunters and warlocks don't need to waste a GCD whent hey ahve /petattack<br />
<br />
If you can't pressure the healer without a pet, you're probably already dead.<br />
<br />
Yes, brilliant. The problem with EB totem is the same problem BoF has.... it's so easy to remove and it's a 1 trick pony. Most classes have an easy means of resnaring their opponents after the break, then we wait 15s again to do it. What's more fun is putting down EB totem and watching them fear my team.<br />
<br />
<br />
Earthbind will, but the snare break is a beneficial effect. Perhaps you'll see an increased range on that half of the effect soon.<br />
<br />
Technically, sure it takes &quot;1.5 seconds&quot; to wand. But you have to stop first, and wanding is a bad mechanic at best, I've never been happy with the time it takes to get that first wand off. And yes, you hit ghost wolf after 1 GCD and they wand for 1 GCD. But that's still time that you're heading towards them and they're standing still.<br />
<br />
Sure it won't let you catch up 20 or 30 yards on them. But if you're getting barely kited (5-10 yards), it will let you close the gap easy.<br />
<br />
It still takes time for the pet to run to the totem (as I said), at least 1.5 seconds. And then there's the slow component.<br />
<br />
-------------<br />
<br />
And if you think a healer/their dps can't relieve your pressure on them, you're deluding yourself. Think of the other side too. They could be just as good as you, and do you expect your own team to have 0 opportunities to drink throughout the entire match?<br />
<br />
Let's say it's a 2v2, with an enhance shaman/druid on the other team (and you're a lock or hunter/healer, lock/druid probably). Your healer needs to drink, so he goes off. Now the enhance shaman plants his earthbind totem, so what choices do you have here? Leave the pet on the other healer so he can't drink? Kill the earthbind totem so he can? If you don't the enhance shaman will rip the locks face off, so that means the totem planting will guarantee the druid some drinking time. Not to mention the pet will be slowed by the Earthbind totem for some extra seconds of travel time.<br />
<br />
I've played a druid in 2v2 a lot, Warr/Druid and Lock/Druid. If you don't have a pet on me, I will drink. And you will lose.<br />
<br />

Not ALL classes have Dispel Magic, you know.....</div></div><hr />

Unless I am totally mistaken you do not need to stand still to wand?<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Exept all classes which do well in kiting enh shamans also have short cooldown abilities to get away if they end up in melee range? Blink, disengage, death coil, etc.<br />
The basic problem is that they can use a non-cooldown ability to counter a short cooldown ability. And then have a short cooldown ability of their own which we then cannot counter at all.<br />
<br />
<br />
It still takes time for the pet to run to the totem (as I said), at least 1.5 seconds. And then there's the slow component.<br />
<br />
Unless the pet is already attacking you in which case the totem is right next to it. I doubt there will be many cases where you will be kited by a pet class which hasn't already sent his/her pet against you.<br />

You do need to stand still to wand. I wish you didn't.<br />
<br />
Blink has the same CD as earthbind totem. Death Coil has a cooldown 8 times as long as earthbind totem. I dunno the CD on disengage.<br />
<br />
And like I said, if the pet is attacking you in 2v2, you've already won. There WILL be many cases when the pet isn't attacking you in arenas. And if you're talking world PVP or 1v1's, why? Those can't be balanced by changes like this, they're based on who gets the jump first and who has more people on their side.</div></div><hr />

Here's a possible idea...<br />
<br />
perhaps instead of nerfing everything, they're going to give everyone something OP. I dont have a high level warrior but i would assume that with the right gear titans grip could be OP. Mirror Image could be considered OP, etc. <br />
<br />
another thing to remember is that so many &quot;unseen&quot; things are bugged as far as abilities and talents go. not as much now, but they're still there. <br />
<br />
My point is, we just dont know yet. and i personally would love to see every class get something that other classes can qq about. kinda makes it unique. The only tihng i cant stand is ppl qqing simply over jealousy. Not because a given ability is really all that OP at all, it just looks cool or sounds cool so everyone else qq's.</div></div><hr />

a snare wouldnt matter since the warlock is a caster? so unless yur gonna be pewpewing him from a really far range there wont be a point..<br />
