Patch 7.3.5 Hotfixes - May 4<br />
tems<br />
<br />
Fixed a bug that allowed players to trade Personal Loot items that should not have been tradeable due to the character having no more-powerful item for that slot.<br />
<br />
Developers’ note: This was an unintended change with Patch 7.3.5.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Quests<br />
<br />
The Camouflage spell for the Redridge Mountains quest &quot;Prisoners of War&quot; should now function properly.<br />

Mythic Dungeon Invitational - Americas and Asia-Pacific Group Stage May 5-6<br />
The Mythic Dungeon Invitationals (https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/esports/mythic) begin in China this weekend!<br />
We’ve chosen 32 teams who have pushed themselves to the limit and proven they are ready for their next challenge in the Mythic Dungeon Invitational. Eight teams from China, Asia-Pacific, Europe, and the Americas will compete over the span of four weekends to see who will make it to the top 8 before moving on to the Global Finals.<br />
<br />
So, What's Next?<br />
Each team will compete in Mythic Dungeons head-to-head in Mythic Keystone dungeons against teams from their own region during four regional stage events. Two teams will advance from each region during a double-elimination, best-of-three format tournament, trying to achieve the lowest time.<br />
<br />
The competitors will need to balance speed, skill, and strategy to claim their victory over their opponents. They'll also need to exercise plenty of caution, as each character death will add 5 seconds to their time. Blizzard will determine the Keystone levels and affixes for the first match, but the losing team will have the opportunity to get the upper hand by selecting the next map and its crucial third affix. All competition will take place on special tournament realms, so all players will be competing on an even playing field.<br />
<br />
Event Schedule<br />
The competition all begins this weekend on Twitch Friday, April 13 when the top teams in China begin their bid to make it to the Global top 8.<br />
<br />
Here’s the full schedule of events:	<br />
<br />
Weekend 4: Americas Group Stage Broadcast<br />
Saturday, May 5 at 10:00 a.m. PDT<br />
Sunday, May 6 at 10:00 a.m. PDT<br />
<br />
Weekend 4: Asia-Pacific Upper, Lower, and Grand Finals<br />
Saturday, May 5 at 6:00 p.m. PDT<br />
<br />
Due to recurring issues during the Asia Pacific Regionals, the Upper Finals, Lower Finals, and Grand Finals will be held after the completion of the first day of the Americas Regional Group Stage on Saturday, May 5. You can read more on our forum post (https://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20763056108#1).<br />

It wouldn't make sense for the Highmountain Tauren, a simple people, or the Mag'har Orc, a tribal and primitive people, to have glowing magical effects. Perhaps the Nightborne should've, but then again, it's a pretty common fact by now that Nightborne are the most rushed Allied Race (most players also think that Void Elves are the best Allied Race by far from a strict customization standpoint).</div></div><hr />

Nightborne have glowing eyes.<br />
<br />
And Nightborne are literally the only Allied race so far with unique run animations and pose. All the rest = animates as the base race, so...<br />
It's not a matter of making it &quot;even&quot; across the factions, it's about creating races around what makes sense for the race rather than satiating the fans acting like they're 5-year olds being served lemonade in pre-school...<br />

That bit about them making sense? Have u ever been to Blackrock Depths? Dark Iron dwarves do not have sizzling hair. Their armour is just as plain as everyone else and I have never seen a Dark Iron dwarf in control of a corehound(what happened to the demon dog mount?). Void elves....which in themselves don't really make much sense have void wings? Ive not seen any semi void creatures with such wings like the VE mount has or their shoulder armour.<br />
<br />
I do agree that the Mag'har and the Highmountain are a very plain simple ppl. However nothing to me ever suggested that Dark Irons were flashy, like why are they letting their hair burn, how did their eyes get a glow (they removed the dragonmaw/blackrock? orcs glow). I mean if were gonna be the bad guys this expansion at least let us be flashy ( just a tiny bit) bad guys are always more over the top.</div></div><hr />

Have u ever been to Blackrock Depths? Dark Iron dwarves do not have sizzling hair. Their armour is just as plain as everyone else and I have never seen a Dark Iron dwarf in control of a corehound(what happened to the demon dog mount?). Void elves....which in themselves don't really make much sense have void wings? Ive not seen any semi void creatures with such wings like the VE mount has or their shoulder armour.<br />
<br />
I do agree that the Mag'har and the Highmountain are a very plain simple ppl. However nothing to me ever suggested that Dark Irons were flashy, like why are they letting their hair burn, how did their eyes get a glow (they removed the dragonmaw/blackrock? orcs glow).

<br />
Why do you assume that past = present?<br />
<br />
The smoldering beards and hair are flavor added by the developers as their vision comes to fruition for what Dark Iron Dwarves are. I can bet you that they'll be adding these effects to NPCs eventually. And yes, the effects do make sense for the race. <br />
<br />
And the Horde is not &quot;the bad guys&quot; this expansion, not sure where you got that idea. It's an expansion about war, the other faction is also at war.</div></div><hr />

About the Dark Iron Dwarves, I do agree about the fire beards seems weird to me and I hope there is a no fire option but its not a deal breaker if they dont. I also preffered the Dark Hound mount over the mini-one-headed-corehound mount from no where but it will probably look cool in-game. But compared to the other allied races the Dark Irons heritage armour is one of the more plain sets which fits with them as you said they just wore plain armour before because they just wore regular low level armour before so of course they would update it. They also always had red eyes they are just brighter now with the updated models but I agree the Mag'har should have had a glowing eye option aswell. <br />
<br />
And there are void creatures with wings, Void Gods and Void Revenant's have void wings.<br />
<br />
But yea they cheaped out on Nightborne big time. When the playable models are inferior to the npc models in-game you know you did something wrong.</div></div><hr />

Lol so its ok to update some races from their past looks...but the orcs have to be the same as we left them 30 years ago, still spikes and furs, they've not progressed at all? Considering they are now living in peace with their alien invaders (Draenei) you would think they would have adopted some newer kit of their own design. Don't get me wrong I really do like the Orcs and Highmountain races and their heritage armours, it just feels like the Alliance versions have had a bit more unnecessary flair thrown at them. There is no reason for the Dark Irons to glow more now than they did when they were enslaved by a Firelord...if anything they would loose whatever gifts were bestowed upon them. As for being &quot;bad guys&quot;, having played thru both sides of the Battle of Lordaeron, the Horde are definitely one foot planted firmly in the morally wrong category. There's a term for what we're being asked to do, its called war crimes, and no &quot; I was just following orders&quot; doesn't cut it.</div></div><hr />

Even the Lightforged Draenei have it. <br />
What's going on there, is there someone at Blizzard who is really in love with that color or something?! <br />
Maybe silly of me to realized it so late, especially since I think it's the main reason I don't like any of those races.<br />
<br />
I guess it's because most of the Alliance uses pink skin</div></div><hr />

<br />
Over-the-top effects fit some races, not others.<br />
<br />
Don't you worry, I'm sure we'll see more &quot;glowy eyes&quot; on races for the Horde as we get more allied races. <br />
<br />
And it's straight from Ion's mouth that there's no such thing as &quot;the evil faction&quot; in terms of Horde and Alliance. Like I said, it's an expansion of war. War crimes will happen on both sides.</div></div><hr />

Haha, so I wasn't just terrible! The quest was actually bugged! I could always muscle my way through it before the scaling since I'd be overleveled by the time I got there.</div></div><hr />
