I like the assumption that The Lich King will &quot;kill us&quot;, and we'll destroy him from the inside. Cool premise.<br />
<br />
But that begs the question... our souls will need to be restored (else how will we continue after?).. does that mean the other souls trapped inside Frostmourne, including Arthas' will also be restored? :o</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xerses</div><div class="date">2009-10-22, 05:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Note: the following is speculation<br />
<br />
<br />
We fight Arthas.<br />
<br />
Arthas kills us all.<br />
<br />
We awaken inside Frostmourne, probably helped by the great spirit of &lt;Alexandros/Saurfang/King Terenas (hence the model)&gt; and need to fight Nehr'zul, some demonic force (say, frostmourne's creator devoured by his own sword) or one of the guys in brackets. We defeat the boss, free the souls, shatter Frostmourne within Arthas's own hand, then destroy him using an army of freed souls. Maybe some of the lore figures above too.<br />
<br />
And we do all of this with the aid of &lt;Thrall/Varian/Mograine/Fordring&gt;.</div></div><hr />

You must allow yourself to be slain by Frostmourne, upon which your essences/soul/etc. is drawn into the blade and you fight within it while your allies fight outside of it. Perhaps it's even done where the raid is inside Frostmourne while the heroes of the Horde and Alliance fight the Lich King physically?</div></div><hr />

This. People come to websites like this to see spoilers. If you don't want spoilers, don't come; simple as that.</div></div><hr />

But.. Why the chains? I don't like the chains :-\<br />
I think that's concerning the symbolism of Frostmourne being a &quot;prison&quot; for souls. <br />
<br />
What I wonder, though, is how 25 players are going to be able to break free if so many other characters in lore have never been freed. Maybe it has to do with the Ashbringer.</div></div><hr />

Boub, you did the right thing.

We get killed by the sword and our souls battle inside of it while Darion and Tirion fight the Lich King in the real world. Odds are Tirion will sacrifice himself and free us by shattering Ashbringer against Frostmourne and rezzing us. Once the sword is destroyed, Arthas will start collapsing the floor or something. His death animation shows him without the sword so yeah possible...</div></div><hr />

I love the circulating chains, but what caught me the most was the mist-like skulls/souls around the room! Beautiful!<br />

When I read Frostmourne room I thought it was a room where the sword was. Not a zone inside the actual sword!</div></div><hr />

Personally I don't want to see them, I get it that some people do. I liked MMO because it was a good place to get compiled information, and see interesting discussions on the forums. After Boubs last post I thought to myself &quot;That's great, at least he's not going to just splash them shamelessly across the front page, I can respect if he wants to direct people to them privately on the site.&quot; So much for that though. Hate mail? Way over the top, not called for, just plain childish. Doesn't serve any purpose. Saying that I was disappointed is the furthest I would take it, some people still remember that look on a friends/parents face when you just *knew* you'd let a bunch of people down.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, fuck me for not liking the illogical idea.<br />

Your problem is with fighting on a platform? And not with the whole idea of being takne inside a sword? The only illogical thing here is you, not to mention your idiotic tendicies to use the f word as many times as you can</div></div><hr />

<br />
Frostmourne's first soul taken was Arthas, this was told to Arthas (the death knight) very early on - that he's essentially soulless. It stands to reason that if you were to meet Arthas within Frostmourne, he might even be a good guy and friendly to you. Same with Saurfang Jr. Deathbringer out in the real world, but the soul stolen at wrathgate wouldn't be evil, simply trapped.</div></div><hr />

in this fight i think that both kinds will spawn and we need to keep the good ones alive and bad ones dead/controlled. good ones gives us buffs, but if we kill them, we will lose the dps (?) buff.<br />
Idea?</div></div><hr />

Honestly guys, no need to hate or rage or whatever. Blizzard probably will keep the biggest of secrets hidden even on PTR. They know making a PTR exposes them to spoilers, when they say they want you to live something, they really mean it. <br />
<br />
So, now you have a room, but you have no more nor less of an idea of what it will be used for, how it will work than you had before seeing it. Happy ?<br />
<br />
Boub keep your website the way you feel it, most ppl will stay, once again, this website is W A A A A A A A Y more than just spoilers. <br />

EDIT : I honestly don't mind getting a look at spoilers, but I am suprised to see how many ppl underestimate the potential of the website ! There is a ton of useful information all over MMO-Champ forums and there is a bunch of you guys vising each day, 2 min a day, to read the ''spoiler'' on the front page. Such a disapointment for me.

<br />
<br />
We fight Arthas.<br />
<br />
Arthas kills us all.<br />
<br />
We awaken inside Frostmourne, probably helped by the great spirit of &lt;Alexandros/Saurfang/King Terenas (hence the model)&gt; and need to fight Nehr'zul, some demonic force (say, frostmourne's creator devoured by his own sword) or one of the guys in brackets. We defeat the boss, free the souls, shatter Frostmourne within Arthas's own hand, then destroy him using an army of freed souls. Maybe some of the lore figures above too.<br />
<br />
And we do all of this with the aid of &lt;Thrall/Varian/Mograine/Fordring&gt;.<br />
<br />

Interestingly enough, there is a new model on the PTR called Unarmed Lich King, or something to that extent, which could help prove your point. Granted, this could be a model used for the 5 man dungeon where he &quot;supposedly doesn't have his sword with him&quot;, but at the same time could be used after Frostmourne is destroyed.</div></div><hr />

On theo ther hand I wanna point out to all the people who mention Ner'zhul. He's dead.<br />
<br />
In the Arthas booek the last chapter. Arthas, Mini Arthas and Nerzh'ul are sitting around a table. Arthas kills Mini Arthas then Nerzh'ul is all happy they hug and BAM! Arthas shuves his knife inside Nerzh'ul and that was the end of him. No more. Arthas is the only one left.</div></div><hr />

It was OK (I guess) to venture into Yog&quot;Saron's brain since he is an Old God and lives beyond the mortal plane and shit, but this is just getting ridiculous. Destroying the sword from within? Fuck sake people. It was made to devour souls, not supposedly allow players to &quot;enter&quot; inside and destroy it. Just, plainly, STUPID! <br />
<br />
Oh, and I hope I am going through all this rant for nothing. Probably Blizzard has some way cooler way to end this. After all, this isn't a fucking Knaak novel where the &quot;heroes&quot; CANNOT FUCKING DIE FOR ONCE... right?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Been said before but worth saying again; Nerzh'ul hasn't had a physical body for a very long time, and it's pretty silly to assume the child-vision of Arthas was a real physical being and not a mental projection. Neither actually bled, they simply 'vanished,' which could easily mean that they were simply suppressed. That said, Arthas' child-self was also contained within his heart, which was obliterated during Icecrown questing. Nerzh'ul, however... well, the hole is large enough to drive a semi through. It would be easy to write him in as 'soul trapped within Frostmourne' or some such.<br />
<br />
I think it'd be very cool to get a chance to fight Nerzh'ul in any case... big-time lore character that we, the players, have never had a chance to meet.</div></div><hr />

Hmm maybe I should re explain myself. This was all happening in the Lich King's Head. There was a table, The Lich King. Nerzh'ul and Mini Arthas. Nerzh'ul gets pissed about Mini Arthas still being there. The story begins. The end of the book. Lich King kills both. So yeah. iti s their spirits. What I'm saying is he 'banishes' the spirits of both Nerzh'ul and Mini Arthas. I have the book right here I can quote it if you like but I'd rather chatt with my gf :P</div></div><hr />

There's a lot of this in the game now. It's easy to see where Blizzard focuses their resources and where they don't.<br />

A lot of the raid encounters are just components of previous battles. There are very few original encounters anymore. It's more like, how did I solve this component last time?</div></div><hr />

Somehow, I don't think it will be &quot;easy&quot;. Rather, it'll be impossible before, and merely possible after. =)<br />
<br />
As for spoilers, as far as I'm concerned, so long as there is some sort of warning, spoilers are fine. The big red &quot;SPOILERS&quot; stamp on the pictures/video mean that, if you don't want to spoil things for yourself, you have only yourself to blame if you click them anyway. Of course, there will be people who argue that sites like this one provide spoilers to people, and then those people go around blurting it out themselves, whether you want to know or not. However, these people will find out these spoilers one way or another, whether it's from MMO Champion or somewhere else, and there's nothing MMO Champion can do to stop that or stop them from spoiling it for others. Therefore, it's pointless to try. <br />
<br />
If Boub wants to post these spoilers, then he should feel free to do so. (And making sure they are clearly marked as spoilers is the best way to do so.) If he DOESN'T want to post spoilers at all? Then that's fine, too. If readers REALLY want to know, they could undoubtedly find it elsewhere.</div></div><hr />

I would recommend that you take a good hard look at the background of the third screenshot, that plain blue stuff is actually animated souls floating around. However, I would agree that making them more prominent would be a good idea. (I didn't even notice them the first time I watched the video.)</div></div><hr />

<br />
And we all know Blizzard would never release duplicate content with new textures.... right? Oh wait.<br />
<br />
<br />
Er, i dont really care about the mechanics of fight itself.<br />
<br />
I more care about how exactly will end Arthas, Frostmourne, Lich Ling as itself, how will end revenge story of Sylvanas, how will end story of Jaina. How will end storz of Tirion, aka all light soldiers against Arthas. How will end Darion, what really up with alexandros. How is Terenas death, the fathermurder, affecting Arthas nowadays. How will be melganis involved..<br />
<br />
I want to know all this stuff, the keys to all those thnigs..<br />
<br />
It doesnt really matter how it will all this ends, the important thing that all this stuff wil actually happen and we wil see it from firsthand^^ Fight itself is guaranteed to be epic, they will take care of it.. And duplicated with new textures? How can you even play wow if this bothers you?</div></div><hr />

Good point, and there's still plenty of time for them to texture it more if they want.<br />
<br />
It could just be that they're trying to remind us in a subtle way of who Arthas once was to be. But the Icecrown floor and the 'Frostmourne' floor share a reference point in that seal, so some sort of phased fight is to be expected.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Maybe not so much Teron where a random debuff was put up. We already have this mechanic where the frozen throne drains x% of your life every 3 seconds, so lets say it gets tuned up a bit where it will actually kill you in a feasible time frame if you don't get heals. say 5% every 3 seconds (if tank healing is too demanding then dial back boss damage maybe, that is a considerable amount of raid damage on top of the I'm sure numerous other mechanics of the fight). Then it becomes entirely possible for say an OT and a healer to die in a short amount of time and then you start letting dps die too to switch over. That way the raid is controlling who dies to go fight frostmourne or what ever other boss is in the room and who stays out to fight Arthas, and when they're finally done inside frostmourne and they break it or what ever they get auto-rezzed and help finish Arthas.</div></div><hr />

I was actually thinking about that myself, or after frostmourne is broken in the final phase(if thats how the fight goes that is) any one who dies is risen by arthas, seeing as how he is the lich king and in control of all the undead</div></div><hr />

That is VERY close to what I was thinking.<br />
<br />
Now, what I had envisioned was a bit bigger though...<br />
<br />
Players everywhere keep asking, &quot;Why can't we LOSE a raid encounter.&quot;<br />
<br />
I think Blizzard designed this with that suggestion in mind.<br />
<br />
IMHO, what will happen is this:<br />
<br />
- Arthas gets down to 10% health.<br />
<br />
- Arthas pulls a surprise ace up his sleeve. (Ie. Converted Bolvar.)<br />
<br />
- The raid wipes. The raid can't release. Arthas claims everyone's soul.<br />
<br />
- Inside Frostmourne, we free/cleanse all the souls that Arthas claimed.<br />
<br />
- We escape Frostmourne into our own bodies, destroying the blade in the process. The redeemed souls of Arthas' victims, led by Bolvar (back in his body) finish the Lich King off.<br />
<br />
- The players are &quot;legendary&quot; for destroying Frostmourne and freeing the souls of his victims. But the lore kill credit goes to NPCs, similar to Maiev/Illidan.<br />
<br />
- Bolvar and Saurfang Jr. take over the Ebon Blade, which is split into separate Horde and Alliance factions for Cataclysm. (You can't have DKs continue to be chummy across faction lines in Cataclysm.)</div></div><hr />

I seriously doubt Tirion is going to be standing around watching. If he [Arthas] sucks your soul with Frostmourne, it's probably gg for you, BUT suppose that Tirion steps up and engages him. The clashing of Ashbringer and Frostmourne would probably have supernatural effects on both swords because IIRC the two blades have never touched in battle. It might weaken the runeblade enough for our oh so mighty heroes to regain themselves. What happens after to get out of the blade is anyone's guess...<br />
<br />
This patch has got me so excited! I quit playing ~2 months ago but I'm gonna come back for ICC!</div></div><hr />
