If I was optimistic, I would say that it's starting to look pretty good for people who expected the Alpha/Beta to start in April. <br />
Beginning Wednesday, April 7 we will begin releasing class previews containing an overview of some of the changes currently being planned for each of the 10 World of Warcraft classes. The type of information you can expect from these posts are a list of the new spells from 80-85, the new passive mastery bonuses for all talent trees, a brief outline of some of the talent changes we're currently planning, and in some cases new low level spells for select classes.<br />
<br />
These changes will by no means be comprehensive, and are subject to change between now and the launch of the expansion. It's also important to understand that some classes are currently further along in the development process than others, and as a result the amount of information will vary from class to class. Please do not let this frustrate you should your class be amongst those which are on the &quot;lighter&quot; side of things, as all classes will receive the same level of design attention before the expansion is released. Additionally we'll be providing more information for all classes, especially as we move into the beta phase.<br />
<br />
Below is the schedule for each class:<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ishamans.gif Shaman - April 7<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ipriests.gif Priest - April 7<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/iwarlocks.gif Warlock - April 7<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/iwarriors.gif Warrior - April 8<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ideathknights.gif Death Knight - April 8<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/irogues.gif Rogue - April 8<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ihunters.gif Hunter - April 9<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/idruids.gif Druid - April 9<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/images.gif Mage - April 9<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ipaladins.gif Paladin - April 16*<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
These posts are being coordinated internationally so they'll be posted at different times throughout the day and night on the given dates to give players around the world the ability to see posts made at a convenient time. This thread will be updated with links directly to each class preview as they're posted.<br />
<br />
*The paladin is still deep in development. Instead of giving a preview that would be potentially less comprehensive than the other classes we made the decision to post it when it's ready, in order to properly honor the paladin class and those that play them. The wait isn't too long however as we're expecting to be able to post it on April 16.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is pretty exciting. We may actually see what changes are going to be made to our trees! Goooo mages. And warriors, priests, hunters, death knights and rogues. And shaman, druids and paladins. ;)<br />
<br />
And it points towards the alpha, if not the beta, kicking into action pretty soon! Exciting stuff!</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
just a quess but its a class that can do all 3 heal dps and tank and is the most QQ class of all time...closely followed by Druids but druids have been well balanced for a while <br />
<br />
<br />
Can't wait to see what they do with the hunters and the no mana</div></div><hr />

<br />
As my main is a protection paladin, my fears are that a bit more changes in the current way will make paladin tanks as viable as we were in Vanilla. Therefore I will prepare for the worst and train on my healing spec. As for hoping for the best... We'll... I'm going to train my healing spec.</div></div><hr />

2. Goblins and Wolfs... no paladins for any of them, that a BIG thing<br />
<br />
3. Pala got to much def spells in PVE, I do think they will change that<br />
<br />
4. About pvp... ret paladins arent That good (agains heavy pvp geared peps its a nightmare, so nothing gonna change here)<br />
<br />

<br />
A plate-wearing, self-healing, 2h melee faceroll class, with extra lives on cooldown; 12 sec immunity, Lay on Hands, stun reduction and removal, Cleanse<br />
How the hell do you balance something like that? If this was a singleplayer game Ret would be THE shizzle.<br />

Only way to balance retribution for both PvE and PvP would be to remove Divine Shield, and.. yeah, as if that'd happen.</div></div><hr />

I just looove to play ele/boomkin because they can be back-up healers in pvp situations. I hope that won't be ruined now that dispells become unavailable, mana pools might shrink, and healing spells costs will be over the top for non-healing spec'd players. If healing as a hybrid caster dps won't be possible, I'll probably just feel like a gimped pure class that has lower dps output and is more boring to play (in the long shot). <br />

They said something about that healers will go OOM quickly if they use big mana inefficient spells, but that it would even out a bit in later content healing gear. I assume ele/boomkin gear isn't suited for healing at all, and that therefor healing spells will always be very expensive to cast for offspec players. This, combined with blizzard stating that healing manapools would be alot more important in cataclysm, made me assume heals will be mana expensive.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Apple_Powah91</div><div class="date">2010-04-06, 08:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">All these people dreading only one spec of their class is going to be viable again (holy paladins, etc). Really? Blizzard has stated time and time again that they want every class and every spec to be viable, they aren't going to nerf and break your class to the ground. Calm down.<br />
<br />
For the people whining about &quot;PvP&quot; balance, look at the dispel changes. It screams PvE balancing. This allows Blizzard to implement more encounters with &quot;interesting debuffs&quot; that don't require a niche class (perhaps wrong words, but only a few classes can fill the roll of dispelling the debuff). <br />
<br />
TL;DR - Calm down, Blizzard knows what they're doing after years of balancing and listening to your QQ. Besides, if anything REALLY BAD happens (it won't) it's beta, and will likely be fixed / balanced by launch date of 4.0.</div></div><hr />

It means that the Beta can't be far off. :D As far as Pallies being &quot;Deep in development&quot; they are the hardest class to balance period. They are the only class that actually uses 3 different sets of off-tier gear. (I say off-tier because boomies and ele shammies can use whatever has int and spell power on it and still be ok while leveling.) I expect there to be some weird changes to pallies in an attempt to get rid of plate heals gear. Idk, make Holy pallies use Plate dps gear? Give us mana and spell power from Str.? (Although, then we'd just stack str. and be unstoppable healing machines that hit like trucks.) IMO the second hardest class to balance is rogues, because they are typically gods in PvP, but in PvE they kinnda stink most of the time. IDK, I hold my real judgements off until I see what is in store for other classes. However I know time and time again blizz has said they want to get rid of plate heals gear, but they can't really figure out a good way to get rid of it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Heals will go OOM if they just spam their largest heal, which is usually the most mana costly of spells. They want healers to use all of their different spells and use them with some sort of intelligence and finesse. Knowing what to cast and when. Ele/Boomkin gear isn't for healing and even tho they will use the same gear as their resto counterparts, the &quot;healing&quot; itemization will turn into DPS stats via talents which you can see on a Blue post somewhere. It explains all about it. Of course the mana cost of Boomkin/Ele's casting healing spells are high. DPS specs don't reduce the mana cost of healing spells. Sure they can still be &quot;hybrids&quot; but you can't expect for the healing spells to be as efficient as they are for the Resto specs. Mana will be important in Cata because they're making changes but they've said time and time again that mana pools are going to be bigger but you're not just going to have ridiculous mana regen and you're going to need to develope some sort of skill to heal in Cataclysm, ie; not spamming your most costly, largest heal for 6min. Healers now just about never run out of mana and if they do, there's just soo many ways to get mana back either thru innervates or just replinishment in general. So many people just turn what the Blizz dev. team says into something completely different. It's more like what they want to hear because they want to complain, rather that what's actually being said.<br />

<br />
Where did you read that hunters are getting energy like Rogues and Kitties? It's more like, you guys are all getting FOCUS much like HUNTER pets use. It's actually exactly what hunter pets use. It should be the Rogues and Kitties complaining that they're not HUNTER PETS, not the Hunter themselves. What a silly thing to QQ about, it doesn't affect your class in any way and it's probably better because you'll realistically never run out of Focus because it will work off haste to regen for all 3 classes. L2read before you QQ about absolutely nothing. I could understand if mana was a huge part of the Hunter class and gave you more than just an ability to pewpew... What you're getting is better.</div></div><hr />

They were still only assumptions, and tbh, they weren't that out of the ordinary and twisted right? I've got the feeling that blizzard is going to make playstyles more fixed to the spec you're playing (removing options for prot/ret etc that they had in wotlk). In that scenario healing spells would fit less in a hybrid caster dps than they do now. But hey, what you're saying isn't wrong either. It were only assumptions, and the real changes will hopefully be presented to us soon :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
However when I noticed that they also have remove dispel magic capacity for ret and prot it sort of made sense. Paladins need a major overall to balance us now that they have removed the main reason why to bring a ret or a pret paladin to arenas. It would not be balanced to remove the ability and keep mages and warlocks as they are atm.<br />
<br />
Ret paladins needs to be separated as much as possible from the holy spec. Ret paladins have time after time been nerfed as a byproduct of changes intended for the holy spec. The less stuff we share the better. And no, I am not a fan of the holy spec. The opposite in fact.<br />
<br />
If they only did some minor changes and then removes cleansing magic effects then we would be seriously broken. Let’s just hope they involve someone that actually understand the ret spec in pvp.<br />

<br />
We thought that retribution paladins did too much damage, therefore we remove their ability to wield 2H weapons.<br />
Protection paladins did mitigate and block too much. Say goodbye to your shields.<br />
Holy paladins have too much mana. Therefore casting spells directly when available will increase the mana use per spell by 5% each use.<br />
Also, we are removing greater blessings. You don't have to carry your SoK anymore. Enjoy your free bag space.<br />
<br />
And as for the person who said that &quot;someone&quot; shouldn't have rolled a lolladin... I guess he just doesn't want his/hers blessing in fight anymore? I mean, who needs paladins anymore...<br />
Please. You play your class because you enjoy it. Let us enjoy ours.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zarghol</div><div class="date">2010-04-06, 09:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Love how everyone's being all negative before getting any info. You think Blizz intend to screw up your class so you don't want to play cata? I'm excited as hell for what my new spells will be : D What will my warrior be able to do? Or my lock? My shaman? My druid? Here's hoping for some CC to my shammy, a stun for my warrior(I like stuns! Getting that Heroic Leap would be awesome, altho I'd stop killing things and just jump, charge, intervene and intercept around in prot spec stunning shit...). No idea what my lockie or druid wants, haven't played them for ages, but really... I can't wait to see what's in store! Highest hope of all would be to remove warrior use of ranged weps though. I wanna pull something from afar? I whip out my big-as-fuck-sword and throw it in your (soon-to-be) bloody face. Let me carry a banner of some sort, something that shows(because badass plate armor and weapons the size of a building isn't enough amirite) and gives me some cool bonus instead of just carrying some invisible thing. Something new and cool to grab aoe aggro could also be nice. <br />
<br />
Also, paladins. You really think they're delaying it because they can't figure how to best nerf you? Seriously, get a grip. They want to do this properly. They want every class to be viable of some sort in every spec, and IMO they're starting to do a good job about that. Paladins heals, tanks and DPSes and can, to a lesser extent, do a bit of all in all specs. <br />
<br />
Shamans can heal and do two kinds of DPS, but as they are best as raid healers, don't wear plate and only have a glyphed absorb, it's not too difficult to balance it out. Druids need to shapeshift in and out and lose important bonuses according to which form they're in, thus you don't see cats standing in a bladestorm selfhealing. <br />
<br />
A ret pally can slam on a +sp 1h and shield if they can't get away from some cooldownblowing melee and spam selfheals, hand of freedom and run, something else. You have a spell to instantly fully heal yourself. I feel really damn sorry for the paladin development team, because yours is a class hella difficult to balance. <br />
<br />
You'd rather have some halfassed, unreliable info to QQ about for a week until the real deal was finished, and then QQ about why they didn't tell you this in the first place?</div></div><hr />

Oh, and we were revamped 5 days before Vanilla release too.<br />
<br />
Le sigh.<br />
<br />
Still, not going to lie, Paladins are in a lot better spot. Protection didn't use to be worth speccing into, and Retribution was certainly lolret. I miss the shockadin, for sure, doing retarded burst combined with Holy-level healing...appealed to my sense of liking to be OP, but overall, I'm not worried here, because the revamps done at the beginning of each expansion are the best ones for Paladins.<br />
<br />
Just remember, Wrath brought us Divine Storm, Shield of Righteousness, Bacon of Light, and HotR. So really, I think that Blizzard has some tasty shit in store for us Pallies.</div></div><hr />

I really do hope they aren't &quot;nerfing Paladins to the ground&quot;, especially since it seems &quot;the rival hybrid class&quot;, Druids, were promised a lot of improvements, especially for moonkins and feral (resto was always OP and will be if they don't break it - yep my druid is resto too).</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hoodi</div><div class="date">2010-04-06, 12:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I like a lot of other paladins got a bit frustrated to be singled out once again. But hey, I should be used to it by now. <br />
<br />
However when I noticed that they also have remove dispel magic capacity for ret and prot it sort of made sense. Paladins need a major overall to balance us now that they have removed the main reason why to bring a ret or a pret paladin to arenas. It would not be balanced to remove the ability and keep mages and warlocks as they are atm.<br />
<br />
Ret paladins needs to be separated as much as possible from the holy spec. Ret paladins have time after time been nerfed as a byproduct of changes intended for the holy spec. The less stuff we share the better. And no, I am not a fan of the holy spec. The opposite in fact.<br />
<br />
If they only did some minor changes and then removes cleansing magic effects then we would be seriously broken. Let’s just hope they involve someone that actually understand the ret spec in pvp.<br />
<br />
I am just very curious of how they will solve this issue because I really did not see that change coming.<br />

<br />
<br />
You betcha.<br />
<br />
Remember how they said they really like the idea of classes not being dependant on cooldowns, not being bursty, and having signifigant ramp up time?<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm thinking Pallies, especially ret pallies, are going to end up with something akin to combo points, which one &quot;judges&quot; off. This would slow down the rotation significantly, neuter the burst, and make pallies everywhere QQ massive floods of tears.<br />
<br />
As a rogue/pally player, this might make me consider playing ret...might actually have some interesting challenge to it other than &quot;what's not on CD?&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
Maybe they have to completely redesign it yet again because they have done a crappy job before? ::)<br />
<br />
I'm not really suprised that Paladins take much longer than other classes. E.g. the Retribution tree - it's a skeleton of a tree (66 points total) made of multipliers. With their current design plan, the tree is going to lose at least 26 points worth of talents. And that's not even counting the potential loss of Seals of the Pure (very likely) and Divine Strength (also likely).<br />
<br />
The sky isn't falling. Blizzard can't afford to screw up one of the most (if not the most) popular classes in the game. They could finally do their job and make Paladins something else than a baseline buff bot with just a tons of multipliers to stay competitive. Probably not going to happen, though.</div></div><hr />

There is no surpise there. THey are always the left out class that then gets some experimental stuff that they nerf to death 2 days before live... or even in a quickfix day after.<br />

It has nothing to do with pet class. It has to do with the fact that Blizzard has not been able to nail down what they want with the class. And they are pissing alot of paladins off every time they take a new turn so the best way is to never really fix em but &quot;rewamp&quot; them every few months.</div></div><hr />

Curious to see changes about them and test it.<br />
<br />
For paladins well I dunno, people says we probably get bad news but if we compare vanilla - BC - WoLK ret got serious good changes. All I'd like is better judgement dmg and a mortal strike effect (at least 20-30%) ad that wouldnt be too much since most classes/pec have one - warr/hunt/spriest/mage/rogue lock idont think but ton cc and for shaman their heroism could compense the lack of one.<br />

They are reworking EVERYONE. They are completely changing gear AND talents for every spec of every class, plus adding mastery. NO ONE is avoiding a complete rework, there is no possible way they could avoid reworking anyone. The fact that Pallies are taking longer to get info means nothing. They've stated straight up that all classes are in various stages of being reworked, and everyone is getting different levels of detailed information. Pallies happen to be the class that they are particularly working on right now, so they're waiting until they finish to release the info. It makes perfect sense.<br />
<br />
It's also important to understand that some classes are currently further along in the development process than others, and as a result the amount of information will vary from class to class. Please do not let this frustrate you should your class be amongst those which are on the &quot;lighter&quot; side of things, as all classes will receive the same level of design attention before the expansion is released. Additionally we'll be providing more information for all classes, especially as we move into the beta phase.<br />
<br />
See? It could be that Shammy info is released tomorrow, and it boils down to &quot;We have no idea really, these are some ideas we're kicking around&quot;. It could be that the Pally info released next Friday is completely comprehensive. It could be the opposite. The Hell people? Did you somehow think that you were going to get a completely revamped talent tree, readjusted gear stats, *and* mastery worked in, without also getting a full class revamp? Other than the core class abilities like stealth, forms, bubbles, etc, it's likely that very little of what we &quot;know&quot; about any class will stay the same.</div></div><hr />

Paladins, and in particular ret are going to be recieving some of the greatest changes in the next expansion.....again.<br />
<br />
They decided to shy away from dps healing so they have to give ret an actual defense asside from healing and lolbubblelol.<br />
<br />
They have to completely revamp ret in pvp with a snare, gap closer, and interrupt since we no longer have cleanse. No other spec as it currently stands would be affected as greatly as ret would with the upcoming changes to dispels in cata. (Possibly enhance shams but still not as much as ret).<br />
<br />
Don't forget they did mention giving new abilities to ret in a post about enhance so as to complicate our damage and give us a way to mess up. All in all I expect ret to be almost unrecognizable from today just like wotlk is to BC.</div></div><hr />

But then again I'm not optimistic, they seem rather comfortable buffing the shit out of retribution and then nerfing it right away as if they didn't bother testing it at all (see divine storm doing holy damage, etc.) This is by no means a QQ post either, I think most pallys would rather get a decently balanced damage specc straight away rather then getting ridiculously buffed and then trickle down to mediocrity with a series of nerfs and enough whining from rogues and other classes to make your ears bleed.<br />

In the end they will be making leveling faster and more enjoyable while redistributing when abilities are acquired and new abilities altogether at earlier levels. For ret Paladin they will be adding likely 1-2 more damage abilities so they can soak up/distribute that burst damage and make their rotation a little bit fun.</div></div><hr />

Anyways, my prediction on rogue changes:<br />
Autoattacks and poisons do less damage.<br />
CP generators do more damage, and bonus damage/effects based on poisons.<br />
Vanish still broken.<br />
Subtlety still not viable in PVE.<br />
RETURN OF SWIRLY BALL. (I demand it!)</div></div><hr />

Think of this, Rogues will have less passive damage from abilities and more passive utility. Poisons might even become abilities like shiv instead of applying them to your weapons you will use attacks to specifically apply the poison you wish to use.</div></div><hr />

Tho blizzard said that they will &quot;remove improved auras, damage, blessings/buffs&quot; in the expansion and the fun part about this is that the paladin class only have talents like that pretty much. :D<br />
<br />
Ill be looking forward to more healing spells and see how the tank will die in future raids, cuz all other healing classes will rage at paladins for not keeping the tank alive and now its not our job anymore :)))))))<br />
<br />
Divine Shield has been removed.</div></div><hr />

The QQ gotta start somewhere, right?<br />
<br />
I was pointing out that people QQ about the upcomming changes they don't have a clue about.<br />
All they know is that there will be some news about their favorite class(es) soon.</div></div><hr />

Just shut up and wait for them to talk. I doubt that 1/2 of the paladins that are complaining now played in BC before it was a FOTM class anyways.<br />
<br />
Woo priest and mage changes! I can't wait to see if my priest will be worth leveling to 80. I'm stuck at 73 and just can't do it. Same with the rogue I was leveling, she's been 70 since BC and I don't think I can level her without some kind of awesome news this time for Cataclysm.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We are already losing cleanse unless you are holy and I really wouldn't mind giving the bubble to just holy as well. This way they can stop bandaid fixing Ret and prot for pvp because of cleanse, bubble, healing etc. Give ret some better tools for long term survivability and maybe a decent way to kill a healer. <br />
<br />
As its stands against high resil targets we cant make a dent and we dont survive long outside of the bubble anymore and this class needs to stop being balanced around an old mechanic that was annoying in pre bc and the way the game has evolved has become a broken ability.</div></div><hr />

I do fear however that it'll either be crappier still or end up being OP heading towards an enevitable nerf in the near future...<br />
<br />
personally ill be happy as long as fire is at least on par with arcane :)<br />
<br />

From what I have heard, stuns will be breaking from a damage % in Cataclysm so it can finally be balanced like all the other CC abilities.</div></div><hr />
