Well yeah that too. I mean look at LotR, they actually built Rohan and it made it seem that much more awesome. They used actual people for Orcs, not CG orcs with hands bigger than a Human body. I am shocked that the Humans are wearing actual armor (even though the armor looks fake in its own right) making everything CG in a movie, usually ruins the movie</div></div><hr />

I don't expect realism but a bit of subtlety. When you make this crap so blatantly obvious, it pulls you out of the story.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thing is, movies are not games. If you are doing live action, ALL that live action needs to look and feel real or it with look and feel cheap to the audience. They want people other than WoW fans to watch and enjoy this. <br />
<br />
As is, it looks like a corny LotR rip off with crappier effects.</div></div><hr />

And give Blizzard more money? How about fuck no.<br />
<br />
And Blizzard games are definitely not something that would ever define someone as a 'gamer. Many, if not all of them now, are essentially the equivalent of candy crush when it comes to time and skill requirements.</div></div><hr />

That is true. But my past experience shows that they showcase everything in the opening ceremony, and that's it. Everything else is just filler. Little to no new information in gleaned from the panels.</div></div><hr />

Yes, mostly because ive stopped playing the majority of blizzard games. Keep checking back to see if they decide to try to make things better.... atleast SC:ghost things are getting shuffled into SC2 kinda how titan got made into overwatch.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As will most of us, we will all go see it. The problem is here dude...no one wants to see Warcraft film fail because all of use would love to see more than one, Warcraft universe is so rich in LORE and the possibilities for sequels, prequels etc etc etc is fucking endless. The problem is once this movie does bad in the box office no studio will touch Warcraft with a 10 foot pole. The CGI is shit it is worse than the Hobbit CGI. For a 10 year project I cannot believe blizzard has green lit that CGI to go in its film final version. For anyone that thinks the CGI will be better for the movie release you are just kidding your self and have no idea how movie production works.</div></div><hr />

Starcraft 2 is one of the most challenging games there is. Diablo and WoW's time requirements are off the charts... <br />
<br />
And why would you not give a company money for providing you a worthwhile product or service? If your answer is that Blizzard games aren't worthwhile, then why are you wasting away your life on a Blizzard game site, complaining like a 9 year old? <br />

Diablo 3 is such a shitty game they didn't even put any effort into the panel.<br />

<br />
WOW that cho'goll is just retarded. so you can only get him if you are AT blizzcon or pay for the visual ticket. or if you have a friend who have him. Just retarded<br />
<br />
So you can't access the full Heroes of the Shitstorm roster because you didn't attend their shitty con unless Blizzard Bobby Kotick and Chris Metzen feel nice enough to let you grind buy him? They'll probably release him, but god damn that's low. I'll laugh my ass off if he's OP, top-tier (Cuz HoTS is a sleazy &quot;pay-to-play, pay-to-win&quot; game).<br />
<br />
As if Heroes of the Shitstorm couldn't get any more sleazier...</div></div><hr />
