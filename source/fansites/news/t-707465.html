http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/24x24/warlock.jpg Cataclysm Class Preview - Warlock (Warlock Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/class-warlock/))<br />
In World of Warcraft: Cataclysm, warlocks will receive changes to their class talents and abilities. Outlined below are some of these changes. Keep in mind that this is an early preview and that these modifications are still under development, so you may see further adjustments to the listed changes as we get closer to launch. That said, here is a first look at these new warlock spells and abilities!<br />
<br />
New Warlock Spells<br />
<br />
Fel Flame (level 81): Quick-hitting spell dealing Shadowfire damage. This is similar to the mage ability Frostfire Bolt, in that the lower of the two resistances (in this case shadow and fire) on your target will be used for calculating its damage. Additionally, Fel Flame refreshes the duration of Immolate and Unstable Affliction. Our goal for Fel Flame is to provide a spell that's good for mobility and for use by Destruction and Demonology specs. Also, did we mention it uses green fire? Yep. Instant cast.<br />
<br />
Dark Intent (level 83): Increases the target's chance for a critical effect with periodic damage or healing spells by 3%. When the target lands a crit, you get a buff to your damage for 10 seconds. This effect stacks up to three times.<br />
<br />
Demon Soul (level 85): Fuses the warlock's soul with his or her demon. This provides warlocks with a self-burst cooldown to use. The specific effects granted by Demon Soul depend on the demon chosen. Demon Soul lasts for a certain number of charges or until it expires (around 20 seconds), depending on the demon used. 2-minute cooldown.<br />
<br />
Soul Shard Overhaul<br />
<br />
This major change regarding Soul Shards was previously announced at BlizzCon 2009. Soul Shards will no longer be inventory items, but instead a new UI resource mechanic. Warlocks will have 3 Soul Shards that can be used during a fight and will not be able to gain additional shards during combat. Soul Shards will not be required outside of combat. Soul Burn will consume a Soul Shard resource, thereby allowing you to use the secondary effects of some spells. Soul Burn has no mana or health costs and is off the global cooldown. Planned secondary effects are outlined here.<br />
<br />
Summon Demon + Soul Burn = summon the demon instantly.<br />
Drain Life + Soul Burn = Reduces cast speed by 60%.<br />
Demonic Circle + Soul Burn = Increases movement speed by 50% for 8 seconds after teleporting.<br />
Unstable Affliction + Soul Burn = Instantly deals damage equal to 30% of its effect.<br />
Soul Fire + Soul Burn = Instant cast.<br />
Healthstone + Soul Burn = Increases total health by 20% for 8 seconds.<br />
Searing Pain + Soul Burn = Increases the crit chance of Searing Pain by 100%, and subsequent Searing Pain spells by 50% for 6 seconds.<br />
<br />
Next you will find a list of some of the warlock spell and talent changes for the release of Cataclysm. There will be further changes, but those revealed below should offer some insight into our goals.<br />
<br />
Changes to Abilities and Mechanics<br />
<br />
All warlock damage-over-time (DoT) spells will benefit from crit and haste innately. Haste will no longer act to reduce the DoT's duration, but rather to add additional ticks. When reapplying a DoT, you can no longer &quot;clip&quot; the final tick. Instead, this will just add duration to the spell, similar to how Everlasting Affliction currently works.<br />
<br />
Curse of Agony and Curse of Doom will be converted into Bane of Agony and Bane of Doom. Bane spells are considered magic instead of curses. This means you will be able to cast one Bane (e.g. Bane of Agony) and one Curse (e.g. Curse of Elements) on a single target.<br />
<br />
Hellfire will no longer deal damage to the warlock.<br />
<br />
Imps will lose Fire Shield, but will gain a new ability, Burning Ember, which is a stacking DoT.<br />
<br />
The succubus melee range will be increased. The succubus will no longer have Soothing Kiss, but will instead have Whiplash, which knocks back all enemies within 8 yards.<br />
<br />
Voidwalker Torment will do increased damage and generate a lot of area-of-effect (AoE) threat. Suffering will become a single-target taunt.<br />
<br />
<br />
New Talents and Talent Changes<br />
<br />
Pandemic will now cause Drain Soul to refresh Unstable Affliction and Bane of Agony on targets below 25% health.<br />
<br />
The ability Fel Domination will be removed (because Soul Burn accomplishes the same effect).<br />
<br />
Demonology will gain a new direct-damage spell, Demon Bolt. Demon Bolt will add a debuff that improves the damage done by the demon to the target.<br />
<br />
We plan to add a new talent, Impending Doom, which will give certain spells a chance to reduce the cooldown on Metamorphosis and Bane of Doom.<br />
<br />
Metamorphosis will no longer be subject to demonic crowd control. Furthermore, abilities available only while under the effects of Metamorphosis will be altered to put more emphasis on the warlock's own spells.<br />
<br />
Shadowburn will now do additional damage to targets below 25% health.<br />
<br />
Mastery Passive Talent Tree Bonuses<br />
<br />
Affliction<br />
Spell Damage<br />
Spell Crit<br />
Shadow DoTs<br />
<br />
Shadow DoTs: The damage caused by Shadow damage-over-time spells is increased.<br />
<br />
Demonology<br />
Spell Damage<br />
Spell Haste<br />
Demon Damage<br />
<br />
Demon Damage: The damage caused by pets and Metamorphosis is increased.<br />
<br />
Destruction<br />
Spell Damage<br />
Spell Critical Damage<br />
Fire Direct Damage<br />
<br />
Fire Direct Damage: The damage caused by Fire direct damage spells is increased.<br />
<br />
Well that concludes this Cataclysm preview for the warlock class. The development of these changes will continue to evolve in the coming months. Please be sure to provide any feedback and thoughts you might have on what was covered here. <br />
<br />
[...]<br />
<br />
Here are a few points of clarification on some of the popular questions or concerns we're seeing.<br />
<br />
On regenerating shards in combat, we will add a mechanic to regen shards if we find that we need to in order to handle variable combat length. We haven’t added one yet because we really want to emphasize locks using shards at the right time and not as fast as they can with then an Evocation-like spell to bring them back again. These are supposed to be special moments in a fight -- think Bloodlust perhaps -- and not used every 20 seconds on cooldown (or whatever the cooldown ends up being).<br />
<br />
Demon lovers, we haven’t ruled out adding a new demon, but we want to be very careful here. We’ve had a hard enough time finding niches for some of the current ones. So we first want to make sure existing demons are cool before we’re faced with Q&amp;A several months from now asking why the new demon either isn’t cool enough, or why warlocks no longer use, say, their felhunter because of the new demon.<br />
<br />
The intent for Hellfire is for it to be a specialty of Demonology warlocks. Affliction would use Seed of Corruption and Destruction would use Rain of Fire.<br />
<br />
Cataclysm Class Preview: Shaman Q&amp;A<br />
We know there are a lot of additional questions and we'll do our best to answer what we can. Keep in mind, this is merely a preview of things to come.<br />
<br />
Q: Will Maelstrom Weapon include Lava Burst?<br />
A: That’s the plan currently.<br />
<br />
Q: How can Elemental Overload proc Lava Burst when Lava Burst already hits so hard in PvP?<br />
A: We’re going to change almost every number in Cataclysm to adjust for everything from single ranks of spells to larger health pools to new combat ratings. With much higher health pools, hopefully burst damage will go back to being a tool and not the only way to win matches.<br />
<br />
Q: What happens to the Lightning Overload talent?<br />
A: It provides a bonus to Elemental Overload.<br />
<br />
Q: Elemental doesn’t want to drop Searing Totem at range. We want to drop Magma Totem.<br />
A: Searing Totem needs to so more single-target damage than Magma. That said, if we’re happy with the ability to occasionally place totems at range there is no reason it couldn’t apply to any totem. Imagine, “After using this spell, the next totem you drop will appear at the feet of your target.”<br />
<br />
Q: Will Elemental have to spend talent points just to get the Spirit to hit conversion?<br />
A: It will be bundled with another attractive talent, such as Elemental Precision.<br />
<br />
Q: Will Unleash Weapon work with Frostbrand?<br />
A: Yes. We just provided some examples.<br />
<br />
Q: Is Healing Rain channeled?<br />
A: No, it's not a channeled spell.<br />
<br />
Q: Is Earthquake channeled?<br />
A: Probably, but we’ll see.<br />
<br />
Q: Will Unleashed Weapon consume your enchants?<br />
A: No.<br />
<br />
Q: Does the 10% spell power buff from Elemental scale with the shaman or the target’s spell power?<br />
A: It will scale with the target the same as Demonic Pact and other buffs that bring the same benefit.<br />
<br />
Q: Are you supporting two-handed weapons for Enhancement?<br />
A: Once you start to get into the dual-wield talents, then Enhancement is a dual-wield tree.<br />
<br />
Q: You didn’t address Enhancement survivability or mobility or X and Y!<br />
A: This was just a preview and is not a comprehensive list of every change. Much more will be revealed in beta and much will change during beta.<br />
<br />
Q: You didn’t answer the most important shaman question! What about Sentry Totem?<br />
A: The Cataclysm is a time of great upheaval. Deathwing’s return to Azeroth tore a hole in the fabric of the universe that tragically resulted in the ultimate and irrevocable destruction of all Sentry Totems. Level designers are contemplating a shrine for the Sentry Totem near that of Uther the Lightbringer. We know shaman players will greet this news with grief, but as with all class changes we’ll have to get into beta before anything is final.</div></div><hr />

Does this mean that we wont be able to hit like 10K anymore? are they gonna lower the damage, lower the gear so that we will be doing normal damage <br />
and not 25K at the end of cata expansion? <br />

Fel flame: It's a Kind of frostfire bolt but using Shadow/flame damage, so it may be used by both affli and destro locks. Instacast. It will appear as a green fire bolt. It will also reset inmolate and UA DoT timers.<br />
<br />
Dark intent: This will buff its target for +3% spell/ healing crits. When it's target lands a critical strike/ heal, warlock will recibe a 10s damage buff.<br />
<br />
Demon soul: The warlock will join it's soul with its demon's, gaining some kind of buff depending on the pet. It will have limited charges or work only for a limited time, depending on the demon. 2 min CD.</div></div><hr />

Those new class changes are looking awesome so far, and it's definately a lot more of the 'fun' cooldowns that Blizzard mentioned they'd implent. I don't have a Warlock myself, but I must say it's about time they changed Curse of Agony/Doom to be seperate from Elements/Shadows.<br />
<br />
Great changes, just like Shamans. Will probably need some tuning though, or I see Warlocks becoming the Retribution Paladins of early Cataclysm.</div></div><hr />

Tbh I was still hoping for perma meta but I guess it'll never happen and some of these spells seem repetitive like demon soul and master demonologist which are basically the same thing but one is passive.<br />

I'd bet quite a few of those wont make the cut and I'm still hoping we'll see the Infernal and Doomguard brought into line with other pets or at least made to be guardians at last.</div></div><hr />

I'm also digging the fact that they seem to be fleshing out the demons more and giving them synergy with the lock. Blueberry gets more tanking utility, Succubus hopefully made useful?, etc etc. I like it!<br />
<br />
Also, PLEASE keep in mind, people, that these changes are tentative and preliminary. Nothing here is set in stone, nor is this list, by any means, comprehensive. After reading the Warlock talents I get a VERY distinct feeling that Blizz is trying to drastically change several aspects of the Warlock class (ie. demons, curses, dots, etc) but is only giving us a SMALL sneak peek at the big picture.</div></div><hr />

? The demon soul term has been in WoW for awhile now... Tbh I'm suprised they'd use such a name for a warlock spell in which Deathwing is involved.<br />

Nvm I get the dark intent now but &quot;stacks up to 3 times&quot; does this mean we'll have to cast it 3 times or will it go up as the target fails to land a crit + is the charge consumed as the crit is landed?</div></div><hr />

A ranged enhance shaman. Theory craft the best sequence and begin the headache during the fight of getting a good rotation.

<br />
I mean unless people play locks because they like the micro management. in that case cool more &quot;on use&quot; buffs</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nivrax</div><div class="date">2010-04-07, 08:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If I understand it correctly, new affliction pve rotation... after putting UA/Corr will be dumbed down to spamming Shadowbolt, using Felfire on CD and refreshing CoA (BoA?). Under 25% is pure Drain Soul spam, this is just stupid (it's like hunters getting Kill Shot with no CD, spamming one shot at last phase instead of weaving it into rotation).<br />
<br />
Destro and Affli pve playstyle seems identical in that situation. Destro perhaps will be more complicated by having 2 extra buttons you hit on CD (Conflag and Chaos Bolt), but rest is about shadow vs fire damage.<br />
<br />
Dark Intent is just Locks version of Focus Magic (absolutely nothing new).<br />
<br />
Demon Soul sounds just like the old Demo talent that sacrificed demon for constant buff. At least now it seem to give much greater benefit, but for short time (another CD to manage instead of boring passive).<br />
<br />
The only thing I really like in this is that putting +13% magic damage curse won't decrease our damage anymore.<br />
<br />
As much as I dislike those pve changes, PvP wise they sound great. CoA/BoA is magic effect, so Affliction will be able to cover it with UA. And at the same time still use CoE to kite enemies, sweet. We will got mini-sprint, and even more mobility (no need to stand still to recast UA). The only thing I fear is that melee classes, to counter this, will get new ways to close in :S.</div></div><hr />

Exactly - we haven't seen the new Rogue talent called Lawl Lock - it causes any and all instant casts directed at the rogue to miss<br />

<br />
Actually the new talent Impending Doom will give abilities a chance to reduce the CD of Meta. Maybe a perma meta is in our future, if we can chain the spells right. Make a macro to activate meta on your casts and when the CD is reduced have it up as often as possible.</div></div><hr />

Dark Intent: Because I really wanted to have an ability like an Arcane mage.<br />
Demon Soul: Not enough info, may be nice especially if it helps add a little burst capability to Affliction and boosting the burst pre 25% of Demo.<br />
<br />
Soul Burn:<br />
w/ Summon: one of the perks of Demo or a HM/PvP Destro spec given to all. Thanks for making it easier.<br />
w/ Drain Life: more PvP oriented<br />
w/ Teleport: PvP<br />
w/ UA: combined with Fel Fire Aff could see some serious burst potential they have lacked for along time<br />
w/ Soulfire: PvP mostly...honestly who cares about SF unless you're demo. This is almost overpowering with the combination of Fel Fire depending on FF's dmg and how it meshes with MC if at all.<br />
w/ HS: could care less...PvP again<br />
w/ Searing Pain: almost exclusively range tanking, probably useless depending on the uses of SB with other spells that might gain more benefit.<br />
<br />
All dots benefiting from crit and haste: won't make it into the expansion with out overall nerfs to dot dmg.<br />
Banes: as a whole absolutely terrible but that could just be opinion. It makes us stronger against druids to an extent and nerfs us vs. priests, palys, and the new shaman dispel. Again more leaning to PvP and could be slightly OP in PvE.<br />
Hellfire: people still use this crappy spell?<br />
Imps: Actually something slightly cool but not enough to fall out of my seat over.<br />
Succubus: PvP only since she's useless in PvE, can see nice instances of doing the LM things like other knock backs but that's going to take timing since pet positioning sucks.<br />
VW: Barely affects PvE or PvP<br />
<br />
Pandemic: Again...refreshing without clipping is hard right? so now post 25% the warlock will what? Just drain soul and that's it? If DS doesn't do dmg anymore and is just used solely as the &quot;Lock Evocation&quot; ability like they said then this could be an interesting change in the priorities.<br />
Demonology: Somewhat interesting since Demo is already twisting SBolt and Incin.<br />
Impending Doom: Honestly Demo gives up pDPS to boost rDPS but this is just going to boost pDPS so unless there are massive boosts to the other trees you get superior raid utility for no loss in dmg.<br />
Meta: Not enough info.<br />
Shadowburn: WEEE execute. Probably a change that should have been done a while ago but at upper tier levels this spell will most likely end up absolutely devastating which means a nerf.<br />
<br />
<br />
So again. Mostly meh with a couple of cool things. The problem is that as is, most of these changes are either stupid or so overpowered they won't make it or will get swiftly nerfed. This is all without mentioning how many are more towards PvP than not. My prediction is that out of all of them Demonology (or some sort of hybrid spec a'la the Demo/Destro specs of BC and early WoTLK) will be all the rage because of massive raid utility and dmg/burst capability, which will get nerfed into the ground something fierce.</div></div><hr />

i play rogue, and i have done since i started playing, but when cata comes out im gonna start 10 fresh characters (1 of each class) and i must say, i think i will enjoy every single one if the warlock and shammy changes are anything to go by.<br />

<br />
<br />
Warlock tanking is not a good road to go down that path leads to moonkin/elemental shaman DPS. Soul Shard revamp is potentially HUGE. The new spells are like &quot;meh&quot; though demonology is going to be crazy cooldown stacking central, with shorter cooldown on meta, demon soul, soul shards, etc.</div></div><hr />

The one cool thing with shaman will be being able to cast while moving, but that is a cd and a 10 second duration. All the lock changes are looking insane to me. So much damage for pve and amazing pvp potential. Warlocks will be the new hero class perhaps...lol</div></div><hr />

It was said in the Shaman Preview to be a deep Elementa talent.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">emni</div><div class="date">2010-04-07, 09:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Fel Flame (level 81): Quick-hitting spell dealing Shadowfire damage. This is similar to the mage ability Frostfire Bolt, in that the lower of the two resistances (in this case shadow and fire) on your target will be used for calculating its damage. Additionally, Fel Flame refreshes the duration of Immolate and Unstable Affliction. Our goal for Fel Flame is to provide a spell that's good for mobility and for use by Destruction and Demonology specs. Also, did we mention it uses green fire? Yep. Instant cast.<br />
<br />
Dark Intent (level 83): Increases the target's chance for a critical effect with periodic damage or healing spells by 3%. When the target lands a crit, you get a buff to your damage for 10 seconds. This effect stacks up to three times.<br />
<br />
Demon Soul (level 85): Fuses the warlock's soul with his or her demon. This provides warlocks with a self-burst cooldown to use. The specific effects granted by Demon Soul depend on the demon chosen. Demon Soul lasts for a certain number of charges or until it expires (around 20 seconds), depending on the demon used. 2-minute cooldown.<br />
<br />
These spells will no doubt be powerful and useful, but it's a bit underwhelming how unoriginal the first two are (slightly modified Focus Magic and instant-cast-DoT-refreshing Frostfire Bolt). :/ Maybe I've just played my mage too much.<br />
<br />
I'm still trying to pick which class to make my main in Cataclysm and unlike shaman, warlock info leaves me somewhat unexcited.</div></div><hr />

The ugly: I find the masteries to be bland and boring, especially next to the unique stuff other specs appear to have.<br />
<br />
Also, no mention about pet scaling.<br />
<br />
In conclusion... I'm disappointed.</div></div><hr />

Demon Damage: The damage caused by pets and Metamorphosis is increased.<br />
Why is it a demonology mastery that it increases the damage you do in Metamorphis. Can't they just buff the talent, or are they gonna make demon form permanent?</div></div><hr />

Hints were given before for new pets but instead they just changed 2 pet spells! <br />
I was hopeing for new pets or if we are not gonna get them then make infernal and doom permanent pets, infernal for some aoe dmg but weak on single target and doom like he already is but parmanent.<br />

As for new dark intent its mage copy&amp;paste :S sigh<br />

sadly, its probably because they are going to completely overhaul pallies once again. but some how they can never get it right the first time. so with a new expansion, they get a chance to completely redo it all again.</div></div><hr />

I'm not mad over this change, just made that they hyped it up when it isn't hype worthy. In fact I think this reorganization helps stream line the tree and prevents people from making poor choices.

They didn't get it right the first time...<br />

or the second...<br />

A lot of stuff was kinda screwy in vanilla though (like hybrids only being able to heal &lt;druids, priests, pallies&gt;... which kinda defeated the purpose of them being hybrids) so i'll scratch that one off the list... Third times the charm?<br />

Every class will be disappointed with their classes changes in cataclysm. From an outside point of view these look like solid buffs. There was a significant amount of QQ from Shamans as well. <br />
<br />
Shamans placed the bar that everyone expects their buffs to be at, but Shamans legitimately need more buffs than Warlocks do, hense why they got more. Prepare to see some classes get less new stuff than yours, and other classes to get more. Its how things work (unless of course your class is the one to get the most/least new stuff).</div></div><hr />

There are no short ends here really, just the perspective from wich you look at it.<br />
<br />
A friend of mine plays a mage, and he was bummed out at seeing the mage changes after seeing what druids got - Berserk, STARFALL, wild growth. I kinda am a little bummed out allready that shamans are gettign 2 awesome spells - earthquake and spirit link. Though they are probably gonne be too damn op at the start, it all depends on the perspective. I know that druids will get some major changes as well, especially the resto part. But im still looking forward to them.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mereli</div><div class="date">2010-04-08, 03:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Dark Intent (level 83): Increases the target's chance for a critical effect with periodic damage or healing spells by 3%. When the target lands a crit, you get a buff to your damage for 10 seconds. This effect stacks up to three times.<br />
<br />
First and foremost: Restoration Druids will not be receiving this buff unless there is some major overhaul to the current HoT system (along the lines of all hots can crit). Note that it only affects &quot;the target's chance for a critical effect with periodic damage or healing spells by 3%.&quot; Therefore, as things stand now, this will be going to other Locks (Afflict, then Demo, then Destro, assuming current setup is predicative of Cataclysm setup), Shadow Priests, and, lacking those, Fire Mages. Of course, looking at the direction Warlocks are headed, Druid preview will probably say &quot;HoT spells cast while in Tree of Life form scale with haste and crit innately.&quot; Knowing my luck, it'll blink...and be covered in glitter. I will then remove my foot from my mouth and give the druid Dark Intent. Let the flaming commence ;D<br />
<br />
Also, Dark Intent will not just be a carbon copy of Focus Magic (which increases the target's chance to critically hit with spells by 3%. When the target critically hits the caster's chance to critically hit with spells is increased by 3% for 10 sec. Cannot be cast on self.) FM provides a Crit buff to the caster of FM, DaI will provide spellpower. While the concept is the same (buff someone else and they will provide a buff to you) the mechanic is nearly completely different.<br />
<br />
As for the Curse of Agony/Doom to Bane of Agony/Doom, I have mixed feelings. This means that Affliction and Demo are going to have to burn yet another GCD before they can even hope to start climbing to their DPS cap, but this will most definitely be outweighed by the increase in DPS of having CoE AND BoA/D on the target simultaneously.<br />
<br />
Lastly, for Warlocks and Soul Burn: The blues have only listed 7 &lt;Spell&gt;+Soul Burn Effects on this preview. These may change, but even if they don't, Warlocks have SUBSTANTIALLY more than 7 spells. Likely, most of them (save maybe primary nukes) will have Soul Burns. I wouldn't be surprised if we see a Metamorphosis + Soulburn (increases the duration of Metamorphosis by 30 seconds), a Conflagrate + Soulburn (Your Backdraft also grants you 125% increased critical damage for 30 seconds), or a Drain Soul + Soul Burn (your drain soul refreshes all Affliction effects on its target and deals 5X Base Drain Soul damage for 30 seconds). That's all 100% speculation, but what I'm getting at is I wouldn't be surprised if Warlocks find themselves with another self-cooldown on top of Demon Soul via Soulburn--and it will likely be talent-tree specific.<br />
<br />
And now, Shaman! Spiritwalker's Grace: incredible. We'll see how awesome it is after balancing. Like many others here, I like it on paper, but implementation and balance are going to be HELL.<br />
<br />
As someone who leveled Enhancement from 1-60, Primal Strike is a welcome addition. Even if it didn't result in a net DPS gain at low levels (which it will) I would have been MORE than happy with just the extra button to push.<br />
<br />
Unleash Weapon: Cool idea. Very cool idea, actually. Needs a much more Shamanistic name...something like Awaken Weapon, Ancestor's Fury...i would be perfectly happy with a universal name for all 4 types like Paladin Judgment (since that's what it is, more or less)...Ancestor's Boon/Fury/Wrath/Something has my vote currently.<br />
<br />
The LHW/HW/GHW appears to be an archetype that we're going to see across all healers. We should have expected it given the hub-bub Blizzard has made about mana lately (and I think most of us, deep down, did expect it).<br />
<br />
Healing Rain is intriguing. On it's face, it looks like a Wild Growth with no target cap. However, from what's spoiled here it will not:<br />
<br />
Smart Heal<br />
Heal people who step out of it's AoE<br />
Be an effective heal without massive amounts of coordination<br />
<br />
Before I get flamed for that last one, let me explain:<br />
<br />
Raids have 10-25 people. In general, 2-3 of them are the tanks...that leaves 8 or 22. If all 22 People are standing in the Rain effect, the amount each of them will heal for will be PALTRY. Thus, getting any worthwhile throughput out of it will require a system for making sure the people who need the heal are getting the heal and those who don't aren't mooching healing off those who actually need it. It'll be a GTAE or a PBAE, too, which will require the shaman to bind it to hotbars, which is a sad story for healers who like grid/healbot. Also, regardless of which type it is, it'll be in one place. If a mechanic like Razorscale's blue flame of death comes back (and you know it will) and 8 people are standing in the rain, likely the rain is about to turn into a death trap....These are just my initial observations, though. I'll have to play around with it on my Shaman before I make up my mind about it :)<br />
<br />
The changes to Fire totems. I personally love this change. And for the many shamans who are up in arms about having to drop a totem to summon an elemental: Elementals don't really like our plane (see Ragnaros...Murmur...etc.). How else would a Shaman coax them into staying here to aid the shaman than binding their elemental essence to this plane of existence (hence the totem). Besides, FET is always a DPS increase over Magma/Searing, especially if you drop it just before Heroism/Bloodlust. The Elemental totem will still buff everyone's spellpower, so it'll still be a DPS gain to drop it just like it always has been.<br />
<br />
Earthquake: Two very big thumbs up! I should not have to mash buttons like a rogue to come in 10th on AoE pulls. Channeled or not, it'll definitely get a big welcome from me.<br />
<br />
Soul Link: Not holding my breath on this one. It got abandoned in Wrath and unless they've hired some brilliant new programmers, it'll suffer the same fate again. The concept is cool, but in PvE practice, what would you really use it for? It's like Blood Mirror, but voluntary. I suppose if Cataclysm bosses are hitting that hard, though...<br />
<br />
Anyway, I'll call it a post there...been following the forums all day and figured I'd share some of my thoughts.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I could imagine many situations when I would use fel flame. Reducing dps downtime in those situations when you absolutely have to move in a fight and also avoid dots dropping off if you can move and refresh UA at the same time with that.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mmoc26966749d9</div><div class="date">2010-04-08, 04:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you click the &quot;Source&quot; button at the warlock preview you'll see some interesting stuff from Zarhym which Boub haven't posted yet, he gotta take a sleep I guess :) So here they are:<br />
<br />
Succubus details:<br />
<br />
Whiplash works similar to Freeze on the mage’s Water Elemental. It requires a targeting reticule. It isn’t just a melee ability that the succubus uses at-will.<br />
<br />
As a clarification, we are removing Soothing Kiss, not Seduction. Soothing Kiss increased the chance the target would attack something else. Seduction is the crowd control more commonly associated with the Succubus, and it’s not going anywhere. ;)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Here's a little bit more feedback based on some of the ideas you're presenting.<br />
<br />
<br />
* We did mean to cover doomguards and infernals, but they didn't make it into our preview. Our plan is that you can summon a doomguard or infernal as a cooldown-based pet, much like the shaman elementals, without having to give up your current, permanent demon. If we add a new demon it will likely be one of these cooldown-based ones, and not a permanent pet like the imp, voidwalker, succubus, felguard or felhunter. We’re just not convinced there is a niche for a new permanent demon (and perhaps not even a temporary one).<br />
<br />
* Flying mounts and female Metamorphosis forms are great ideas and something we’ve had on the wish list for a long time. We can only create so many new creatures during a single expansion, and getting one of these might mean fewer new creatures in outdoor worlds or dungeons. It’s just a trade-off and sometimes you have to make hard calls. We’ll keep them on the list though.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Here are a few more answers for you to digest.<br />
<br />
<br />
* We do like the idea of allowing warlocks to re-skin their demons and have been talking about possible ways to implement this. I have no concrete information for you at this time beyond that.<br />
<br />
* When it comes to naming demons, this has always been one of those sacred cows, where the hunter gets to name their pet because he loves his pet bear, but the warlock considers the demon to be something disposable -- a tool.<br />
<br />
* The Demon Bolt debuff will only affect the warlock's demon, not other demons. We wanted a Demo-themed nuke that made it feel like the pet was part of the damage.<br />
<br />
* For Soul Shard bags, we will probably do something like remove all the shards, reduce the bag size (a little) and convert it to a normal bag. This would be a one-time conversion. We'll probably get rid of the recipes, as we wouldn't want other classes to go out and get shard bags just to get a free bag.<br />
<br />
Shaman Q&amp;A: Nethaera<br />
<br />
Here's another question (statement) that we can address for you:<br />
<br />
Q: Please make the &quot;nature damage&quot; for the enhance tree &quot;elemental damage&quot; so our bonus for putting points in isn't only affecting our nature damage.<br />
<br />
A: We actually went with Nature damage for that reason. We thought all Elemental damage might end up just feeling like “damage.”; Since Nature damage is only a portion of your damage, choosing between an item with say haste versus mastery (i.e. Nature damage) might be more interesting. With a lot of mastery, you might actually favor other talents or different spell rotations. All of this just theoretical at this point and the passive talent tree bonuses are likely to see much iteration in beta.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Focus Magic<br />
Boosts the target's crit chance by 3% (probably being changed to not apply to dots), and when the target crits, you gain higher crit.<br />
<br />
Dark Intent<br />
Boosts the target's DoT and Heal crit by 3%, and when they crit, you gain more damage.<br />

Voila, two spells that are both useful, but not identical. :3<br />

<br />
Soul Shard Overhaul<br />
<br />
This major change regarding Soul Shards was previously announced at BlizzCon 2009. Soul Shards will no longer be inventory items, but instead a new UI resource mechanic. Warlocks will have 3 Soul Shards that can be used during a fight and will not be able to gain additional shards during combat. Soul Shards will not be required outside of combat. Soul Burn will consume a Soul Shard resource, thereby allowing you to use the secondary effects of some spells. Soul Burn has no mana or health costs and is off the global cooldown. Planned secondary effects are outlined here.<br />
<br />
Summon Demon + Soul Burn = summon the demon instantly.<br />
Drain Life + Soul Burn = Reduces cast speed by 60%.<br />
Demonic Circle + Soul Burn = Increases movement speed by 50% for 8 seconds after teleporting.<br />
Unstable Affliction + Soul Burn = Instantly deals damage equal to 30% of its effect.<br />
Soul Fire + Soul Burn = Instant cast.<br />
Healthstone + Soul Burn = Increases total health by 20% for 8 seconds.<br />
Searing Pain + Soul Burn = Increases the crit chance of Searing Pain by 100%, and subsequent Searing Pain spells by 50% for 6 seconds.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
All of that I HATE!! I personally don't mind having shards in my bags....I like to be able to use my abilities at will not wait on a &quot;Death Knight Rune&quot; cooldown cause thats how it seems its gonna be like. Its something that puts mages and warlocks apart....i mean you've allready given Frost Mage's a Glyph to make it so that their water elemental doesnt go away. So in that aspect isnt the mage slowly becoming a warlock? I rolled a warlock because it was something complete different then anything I have played b4, it was the turn of Character class's that i was looking in a game. &quot;The Dark Class that Enslaved Demonic Beings to do Their Bidding&quot; imo you took that away when mages got that glyph....and now your gonna take away one of the few trademarks we have left?<br />
That's not right, I dont think that this change should go through just like the Resto Druids Tree Form. YOUR TAKING THE SOULS AWAY FROM THE PPL THAT LOVE THEIR CLASS. :'(<br />
<br />
Edit* And I quote &quot;Searing Pain + Soul Burn = Increases the crit chance of Searing Pain by 100%, and subsequent Searing Pain spells by 50% for 6 seconds.&quot; Isnt searing pain the move that Pulls Very High Threat? <br />
WHY THE HELL WOULD I USE THAT?! <br />
Make a move that allready pulls alot of threat pull more? <br />
Makes ZERO since.</div></div><hr />

Debatable, i hate Soulshards as they are right now and i don't think that they are taking away some of the warlock-feeling with that change. I still got demons, carnage and decay. All i need.<br />

...no.<br />
<br />
You won't be waiting for any Soul Shard cooldowns, since &quot;Warlocks will have 3 Soul Shards that can be used during a fight and will not be able to gain additional shards during combat.&quot; (see the first page of this thread for quote)<br />
<br />
As it has been announced now, Soul Shards will not regenerate, so there's no &quot;rune cooldown waiting&quot; like you seem to think.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Soul Shard system will still be unique. And please, frost mages getting a permanent water elemental? How many raiding frost mages are there anyway? No PvP mage uses that glyph, that's for sure. Besides, Hunters have pets too, warlocks have never been exclusive in that aspect. Warlocks are still the only class that &quot;enslaves demonic beings to do their bidding&quot; and that has different minions to fill in different roles. If anything, you should be complaining that hunters will gain 2 more active pets, thus getting one step closer to how warlock minions work.<br />
<br />

Ever heard of warlock tanking? Any good warlock is rejoicing at that change because it hints they'll get to tank again. But I guess you weren't around for Burning Crusade...</div></div><hr />
