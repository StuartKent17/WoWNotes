<br />
Also today<br />
WoW/MMO Glider Update (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/14910002728-wowmmo-glider--update.html)<br />
Sapphiron and Malygos Hotfixes (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/12/14910003119-sapphiron-and-malygos-hotfixes.html)<br />
<br />
As we have suggested, we have become concerned that mana regeneration is currently too powerful, especially for healers. We want players to have to keep an eye on mana. We don’t want you to go out of mana every fight, but running out of mana should be a very real risk for sloppy playing or attempting content that you aren’t yet ready for. When mana regeneration is trivial then certain parts of the game break down – classes that offer Replenishment are devalued, stats that offer mana regeneration are devalued, and spells that are efficient are neglected in preference to spells with high throughput.<br />
<br />
Here are a list of changes you are likely to see in 3.1. They will be available to try out on the PTR. Mana regeneration is somewhat technical, so please bear with us.<br />
<br />
Regeneration while not casting (outside of the “five second rule”) will be decreased. We think that (1) the ability to cast heal over time spells and then sit back and (2) benefitting from a clearcasting proc that also gets you out of the five second rule both provide too much mana regeneration, even over short time periods.<br />
To make this change, we are reducing mana regeneration granted by Spirit across the board. However we are also boosting the effects of talents such as Meditation that increase regeneration while casting. The net result should be that your regeneration while casting will stay about the same, but your not-casting regeneration will be reduced. This change will have little impact on dps casters, since they are basically always casting.<br />
The specific talents and abilities being boosted are: Arcane Meditation, Improved Spirit Tap, Intensity, Mage Armor, Meditation, Pyromaniac and Spirit Tap. Yes this makes these “mandatory” talents even more mandatory, if such a thing is possible.<br />
Since paladins rely less on Spirit as a mana-regeneration stat, we have to address them in other ways. We don’t want to change Illumination or Replenishment. However, we are going to increase the healing penalty on Divine Plea from 20% to 50%. Divine Plea was originally intended to help Protection and Retribution paladins stay full on mana. It should be a decision for Holy paladins, not something that is automatically used every cooldown.<br />
In addition, we are also changing the way Spiritual Attunement works. In situations with a large amount of outgoing raid damage, as well as in PvP, this passive ability was responsible for more mana regeneration than we would like. We want to keep the necessary benefit it grants to tanking Protection paladins, while making it less powerful for Holy paladins in PvP or raid encounters with a lot of group damage.<br />
We are also taking a close look at clearcasting procs themselves. One likely outcome is to change them to an Innervate-like surge of mana so that the net benefit is the same, but healers won’t shift to out-of-casting regeneration so often.<br />
We balance around the assumption that even 10-player groups have someone offering Replenishment. To make this even easier on players we are likely to offer this ability to additional classes, as well as make sure that existing sources of Replenishment are more equitable.<br />
These changes are ultimately being done to bring the different healing classes more in line with each other as well as to give the encounter team more leeway when designing encounters, who can balance with these new mana regeneration numbers in mind. In a world with infinite healer mana, the only way to challenge healers is with increasingly insane amount of raid damage, so that global cooldowns become the limiting factor since mana fails to be. An example is the Eredar Twins in late Sunwell. We weren’t necessarily happy with that model, and this change hopefully allows us to move towards giving healing a more deliberate and thoughtful pace rather than frenetic spam.</div></div><hr />

Yay finally!!! Spirit users and pally regen was ridiculous!! No more 1k mp5 while casting for Trees or Priests. No more 1 min free Mana Tide for Pallies. They did well balancing it as to not make it useless for Prot/Ret but still keep it viable for Holy. I'm lovin' it.</div></div><hr />

Perhaps they will make the Water Elemental give Replenishment, but I doubt it. The Warlock notes indicate Destruction brings it now, so we have:<br />
<br />
Shadow Priest<br />
Destruction Warlock<br />
Survival Hunter<br />
Ret Paladin<br />
<br />
I tend to doubt they would give Fire or Arcane mages Replenishment, it would just be overboard. Perhaps they will throw it into a shaman totem or something, but 4 classes with Replenish seems reasonable.<br />
<br />
As to Paladins, if they intended for Divine Plea to be a Ret/Prot ability, make it the 11 point talent in Prot and give Holy a new way to regen mana.</div></div><hr />

While they say they want to make regen more important and that we use our spells wiser, I can help but feel my ability to control my own regen and mana gain during combat has now DECREASED and we all have the same baseline regen while casting whether we use good tactics or not.<br />
<br />
I will reserve final judgement till I see more, but at the moment, it doesn't seem very good.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also &quot;healers have an easy time with regen&quot; is a bit subjective, in fights such as Malygos and Sapphiron, a lot of healers struggle to last till the end of the fight already.<br />

I wonder if the they are upping the difficulty of being a healer too much, relative to how hard it is to be a dps in a similar encounter.</div></div><hr />

3 of those 4 classes/spec are some of the most under represented classes, on my server at least. it seems now that the only readily available class with replenish is Pallies. Sure adding it to warlocks is fine, but how many times have you gone to heroic arch and had lock gear drop only to realize there is no lock in the group.<br />
<br />
Id like to see it come from *gasp* a healing class, or a tank class :)</div></div><hr />

Some people don't want to do things the hard way like big, bad boys. Some people just want to have fun.<br />

Seems to go against the, take the player not the class. If you need ore more skill for mana regen and everyone just gets what ever they get, then it nerfs the skilled and buffs the unskilled. Double edged sword. Increases the bad healer population for lower level instances but decreases the skilled population as they look for other classes to play because it's become too stressful.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ajaxthegreat</div><div class="date">2009-02-05, 09:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ye and holy cant spend 11 points in prot....<br />
<br />
<br />
11 points in prot means giving up all those crit talents in the Ret tree; seems like a fair tradeoff to me as someone with a holy pally. And I meant include the 50% MS effect on the talent if you did this.<br />
<br />
Consider a spec like http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?paladin=050000000000000000000000000503500523001300531025312511403201000000000000000000&amp;glyph=110819040605 where the 11th point in Prot is Divine Plea (at 50% MS). Doesn't seem overpowered to me at all.<br />
<br />
Edit: Add link</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jukaï</div><div class="date">2009-02-05, 09:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, this is exactly right.* What's the problem?<br />
<br />
<br />
The 'problem' is that DPS got numbed down so a sea pirate with a pet monkey and a hook for a left hand can play.<br />
Tanking got overhauled (read: simplified just like the DPS role) and given all new sorts of shiny toys up to even a increase in damage output.<br />
<br />
So where is Blizzard going to enforce the required benchmarks to make encounters somewhere remotely challenging ? Exactly.<br />
<br />
Not only are we working with outdated mechanics in a tedious environment - we haven't received any worthwhile talents, haven't gotten our previous one buffed/altered nor received any new shiny toys or saw any beneficial bone thrown at us - we only got our job made more harder and more tedious.<br />
<br />
I have to watch my surroundings, twenty five health bars and cooldowns - I certainly do not intend on having to watch my mana-bar as well.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NightmareB4</div><div class="date">2009-02-05, 09:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As a resto shaman who never goes OOM...all I can say is...hahahahahaahhahah! Hope you all can adjust your healing playstyles!<br />
<br />
:P</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mmoc93c1e7e232</div><div class="date">2009-02-05, 09:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh yeah, great. First they say, they don't want healers to only watch health bars. My understanding of this was actually that healers would now be able to see a little more of the actual game. But nonono, they want us to look not only at health bars, but also at our mana bar!!<br />
<br />
On a more serious note, I think that making mana a scarce resource is a relatively stupid thing to do:<br />
<br />
All melees have a resource that actually limits the direct use of an ability (no rage --&gt; no shieldbash or whatever, no energy --&gt; no eviscerate (no clue about rogues :)), no runepower or rune available, no &lt;insert something DKs do&gt;, etc. you get my drift).<br />
<br />
Making Mana a limiting resource is completely different: You can still go all out on all of your abilities for a minute, 2 maybe 3, depending on how hard they'll nurf it. BUT, then suddenly you're completely out and can't do anything for a rather long while, when your mana is gone. Especially as a healer, I guess that means: Tank dead, wipe.<br />
<br />
Whereas I think it is ok to have to longer-term plan a fight, it just even more widens the gap between DPS players who just have to do their (easy) thing and healing players that require skill... Do you really think that will help with the healer shortage that a lot of people here are complaining about?<br />
<br />
Just my 2 cents.</div></div><hr />

<br />
-knocks on wood-<br />
<br />
Anyway, back on topic, I agree with posters above, this does noting to alleviate the healer shortage. <br />
<br />
Heck, if my guild looses one healer because of vacation/work or something we've gotta split our 25 man into 10 mans because we only have a small amount of healers.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lumnights</div><div class="date">2009-02-05, 10:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">All the Divine Plea nerf is going to do is stop mid-range/early raiders from being successful in any capacity. Sure, tons of high-end paladins never run out of mana, because the people they raid with take less damage. For mid-level or new raiders, paladins are going to start running out of mana real quick due to the 50% heals they'll have to double-up to heal the same amount. Sure, you could use AW to make up for it, but there goes your bubble that could save you from the stray mob that'll 2-shot you.<br />
<br />
I know that this all depends on the players you raid with, but I've healed 10 and 25 man raids recently and it's no walk in the park, even with skilled players. This nerf just serves more to seperate the super-elite players from the merely good ones.<br />
<br />
All Blizzard's rhetoric about healers not running out of mana doesn't resonate with my experience at all, and seems to apply only to bleeding-edge raiders; And I can't expect that Blizz is concerned that paladins aren't running out of mana in 5-mans. I have 21k mana and I still run out of mana during tougher raid fights.<br />
<br />
If blizzard wants to nerf DP, they should just nerf the regen'ed amount of mana, not this 50% healing reduction bull. If it's &quot;go time&quot;, I need my heals to hit at full capacity. Ironically, I'm going to need DP at that time most of all. I'd rather be able to cast a spell just once at full effect, than HAVE to cast it twice for the same.<br />
<br />
Holy paladins beware, your job just became f&amp;$%ing stressful.</div></div><hr />

Anyway, back on topic, I agree with posters above, this does noting to alleviate the healer shortage. <br />
<br />
Heck, if my guild looses one healer because of vacation/work or something we've gotta split our 25 man into 10 mans because we only have a small amount of healers.<br />
<br />
<br />
Pretty typical of many guilds. Healing sucks and is no fun and gets no visibility. Everyone wants to DPS because it gets all the attention.</div></div><hr />

Back in &quot;the day&quot; (it was, indeed, a Wednesday) in 40-man raids, we used to have healing rotations set fom MC, AQ40, and BWL. We KNEW that the main bank of healers would go OOM on a boss fight, and they would rotate out at 25% with the next batch subbing in. Of course, this kind of thing could never work now because of healing meters, dps meters, etc. Back on that Wednesday, we raided to win the battle...there was strategy, teamwork, and no chest-thumping or finger-pointing. Now everyone fights for top of the meter and figures that will get the job done. Sounds alot like a Wall-Street brokerage house to me. To be fair, though, alot of guild leaders and raid leaders use those same meters to determine who is pulling their weight.<br />
<br />
I think this will be a great thing for 10 and 25-man raids going forward...but I worry a bit about how it will dramatically slow down heroics while the casters sit and drink after every pull (where there is generally only 1 healer). Can we do something in 5-man content to keep mana regen higher? Maybe more mobs dropping a bit of &quot;loose mana?&quot; Or maybe some powerful instance-specific pots that could drop (like we used to have in TK?)</div></div><hr />

We want our cake and eat it too, right? So is everyone here that doesn't like the changes to healing saying that healing isn't too easy right now? There are forum posts up and down about how &quot;boring&quot; and &quot;easy&quot; healing is right now. How healers never go OOM, etc. <br />
<br />
Raids are easy because of the following:<br />
<br />
A) Threat generation (for non-idiot tanks) is easy, making watching threat meters almost an afterthought. Blizzard could change this by reducing the threat multipliers for all tanks across the board while slightly increasing TPS for most other classes (forcing other classes to use their threat-reducing abilities - when was the last time a rogue used vanish in PvE?), and listen to the tanks QQ.<br />
<br />
B) Due to the QQ about everyone's class not being on top of DPS meters, Blizzard increased DPS damage for most classes across the board. Perhaps Blizzard could make every encounter a DPS race and have enrage meters that stack based on how long the encounter is going (like Widow, but worse). <br />
<br />
C) Change healing mechanics (see blue post). <br />
<br />
<br />
How's this as an idea....we all adapt to the changes, and play. Or we can all QQ and whine and bitch and moan about A VIDEOGAME - which is obviously much more fun.<br />
<br />
Blizzard is going to use the nerf bat, and swing too hard, player QQ, buffs come now all the content is too easy (player QQ), cycle continues, etc.,etc. How about we as players give some constructive feedback (not just nerf nerf nerf buff buff buff QQ QQ QQ), and while Blizzard chews on our suggestions, we adapt to the game we love to play?</div></div><hr />

The end result will be that you won't be able to bring mediocre DPS anywhere, because you have to kill the boss in a very finite amount of time.<br />

Divine Plea was directed towards Retribution and Protection Paladins :-)<br />

We think that (1) the ability to cast heal over time spells and then sit back and (2) benefitting from a clearcasting proc that also gets you out of the five second rule both provide too much mana regeneration, even over short time periods.&quot;<br />
<br />
I though that was the whole point of clearcast, to be able to heal efficiently if youre smart and can combine things like that.<br />
<br />
Its not the manaregen that is buffed too much, its the current raid content being a complete and total joke when you have full naxx25 and higher gear.<br />
<br />
I had insane mana problems when i had full T6 when we started with Naxx 10 man. When I had Heroic(Naxx 10 man and Heroics), I had problems in Naxx25 man, and it wasint until Malygos and Sath 3 drakes that i felt my Naxx25 gear being less and less pressured. But with probly the best optimized gear for regen that i could possilby get: Yeah, i dont have mana problems in the current raids anymore. <br />
<br />
If you would just go ahead and release ulduar now, i bet you we woulnt last long even with this &quot;OP&quot; mana regen.</div></div><hr />

This is taking mana regen down a level, making mp5 the way to go now or intellect(as priests). I agree there are some bizarre circumstances; for example, there was a priest in a 3D run who could hit 2,100 spirit, with over 700 mp5 while casting. The problem isn't mana regen, people just don't have to heal anymore, and that is the problem.<br />
<br />
As a priest who normally tops the so-called &quot;meters&quot; with effective healing, and never reaching zero mana I believe the tanks are the issues in why mana regeneration is so high. During an average fight, the tank needs less heals than the raid does, you just don't heal as much anymore. <br />
<br />
I find myself sitting outside the 5SR more time than I am inside the 5SR. People just don't need to heal anymore, bosses don't put the damage out as they should. Fights like Sapphiron who is currently bugged are the only fights you really have to heal on, and even then is paly spamming HL on the tank, priest spamming PoM and binding heals. And shamans with cheatheal on melee. It just isn't even that hard anymore, Frost Resistance wtf is that?<br />
<br />
The only way people die now a days is they're too undergeared for the raid, jump into lava waves, or void zones.<br />
<br />
In my honest opinion, nerf tanks, and increase the amount of raid damage. It will actually allow healers to heal instead of standing there seeing how much mana they don't have to spend, or how much overhealing they can get.<br />
<br />
Besides, look at Prot in pvp, its almost no contest 1v1 unless you're an amazing pvper.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ewhenn</div><div class="date">2009-02-05, 11:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In addition, we are also changing the way Spiritual Attunement works. In situations with a large amount of outgoing raid damage, as well as in PvP, this passive ability was responsible for more mana regeneration than we would like. We want to keep the necessary benefit it grants to tanking Protection paladins, while making it less powerful for Holy paladins in PvP or raid encounters with a lot of group damage.<br />
<br />
If this starts burning on PvE tankadins, there is gonna be so much outcry about it. As if we didn't have enough mana problems as it is....<br />
<br />
<br />
Ret as well.<br />
<br />
A very sizable portion of my mana regen come from SA. As a random example I looked at our last Kelthuzad Kill.<br />
<br />
Sanctified Judgement : 42 Times ( 27679 Mana)<br />
Spiritual Attunement : 223 Times ( 22454 Mana)<br />
Judgement of Wisdom(R1) : 114 Times ( 10017 Mana)<br />
Mana Spring Totem : 216 Times ( 7344 Mana)<br />
Replenishment : 363 Times ( 6203 Mana)<br />
Divine Plea : 12 Times ( 4004 Mana)<br />
<br />
Granted I didn't need to use Divine Plea much, but Spiritual attunement makes up about 30% of a Rets mana regen. It restores about 2000 mana per cast, even if I was chain casting it, it still wouldn't make up for what I would lose if they greately reduce SA...and I'm not a healer, my mana isn't a problem.</div></div><hr />

For holy paladin perspective - those that are not raiding 24/7 - this takes care of all chance of 5 man grouping. Now they will NOT be able to use the extra mana they so despiretly need in the big AOE fights and throwing out heals to 5 ppl at the same time ... Why you might ask? Because nerfing spiritual atunment for them means they no longer get heals back from BOL when it heals themselfs. <br />
<br />
For all the other healers. Will this make your 3-7 days playing WOW for 3-5 hours raiding more fun ? Answer - no<br />
<br />
For Blizzard. Will this solve the healing shortage ingame? Will this prevent ppl that play healing classes beeing FORCED to play healers and then come whining again that they are not viable as other specs of their class ? Again - answer is no.<br />
<br />
Blizzard needs to sit down now and actually totally rethink healing in general. Why for example are 6-8 healers needed for 25 man raid while just one tank in some encounters ? <br />
<br />
I stopped playing healer in wow cause I gave up on the buff - nerf cycle they put classes through. It has now started again with the huge buffs to priest class that after dual spec can switch between the two healing specs and whooola - thats all the healing your raid will ever need. 7 priests healers in a guild - and no need for other healing classes since its to hard to rely on 1 pala to show up to all raid - but to much having 2 paladins cause one would ALWAYS be sitting out. <br />
<br />
Gratz Blizzard. <br />
<br />
And I feel real sorry for holy paladins that have 3 single target button to chose from only - and now their main conserne will be running out of mana while keeping 5 ppl up.</div></div><hr />

Being an active raider myself, I am well aware that some classes are built to be mana fountains. Others, however, are not designed to be such. The ones who are built to regen mana like mad will be effected and thus become more challenging, sure. But the ones who DO run out of mana will suffer greatly.

The one thing that worries me most is in the Class Changes forum. Priests are already outdone by the other healers; Shamans rule at group heals, Druids rule at HoTs, and Holy Pallies rule at single target heals. My personal belief is that specific function classes should be more effective at specific roles. For example... I firmly believe that priests should be the best healing class, because they are designed for one of two things. Heal, or Shadow. Shamans and druids and paladins, who can do multiple tasks given the gear and a proper spec, should not make priest-players obsolete. I worry that Blizzard is inadvertantly crippling one of its classes. :/</div></div><hr />

Consider a spec like http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?paladin=050000000000000000000000000503500523001300531025312511403201000000000000000000&amp;glyph=110819040605 where the 11th point in Prot is Divine Plea (at 50% MS). Doesn't seem overpowered to me at all.<br />
<br />
Edit: Add link<br />
<br />
<br />
So you want to make it worse than what blizzard is suggesting for all paladins? That doesn't benefit anyone in any way except people who hate paladins.<br />
<br />
I think if anything it would be better if it were 2 mins untalented with the current 20% healing penalty. It would cut down the regen benefit by half (it's 20% of my regen currently this would bring it down to 10-12% I'd say. I don't pop it every cooldown.) Then in the deep ret and prot talents that are out of reach of Holy, put something in to give them one minute off so it acts as it does currently for them.<br />
<br />
There is a difference between making something not too good for one spec and utterly detrimental to the point it can't be used. The other healers get mana regen tools and none of them are detrimental to them (although shadow fiend is unreliable due to survival, its presense doesn't gimp priests.) <br />
<br />
Lowering the benefit from Spiritual attunement is a completely horrible idea. This will make life for Holy or Ret ghetto tanking all the more difficult, and Blizzard said they wanted them to be able to do this for at least normal instances. Spiritual attunement is an insignificant amount of mana regen for me in most raids. I think maybe about 2% through all of Naxx. The only two fights I have found it to be a big help is Loken to keep me in enough mana to heal through the damage and Sapphiron on 25 man. On 10 man Sapph I can't even afford to beacon myself most of the time for the regen.</div></div><hr />

You CAN NOT be this stupid. For a druid/priest to have 1000 in combat mp5 they would need to have 3000 out of casting mp5. I'm not sure about the numbers but my druid has about 1000 spirit and about 1000 out of casting mp5. That would mean (although these numbers are probably off) I would have to triple that to get what you are talking about. I don't see very many druids/priests with 3000 spirit.

How can you even compare Divine Plea to Shadow Fiend?<br />

I'm sorry. Priests are DESIGNED to be healers or DPS. If you play a paladin, then you are a Hybrid. This means, you should be usable in healing situations with certain strengths, but you should not be a replacement for a priest.</div></div><hr />

<br />
the plea to 50% thing is retarded. dont give me it was intended for prot pallys, when its IN THE HOLY SPELL BOOK.<br />
and cracking up the penalty by 2x is simply gonna cause the pallys to no longer be capable of healing main tanks. Theres no way a holy pally will be capable of healing MTs in raids if you demolish the current mana regain, without droping the current dmg done, it just wont happen.<br />
<br />
im not saying healing is easy, im not saying its overly difficult. i enjoy it-really i do. <br />
So lets look at what the problem is.<br />
The problem is classes that give RAID BUFFS to increase mp5 are getting over lookd thanks to healers who are capable of being self sustaind with there own mp5.<br />
<br />
So basicly blizz is suggesting that is is MORE important to have these classes in the raid, than it is to have a good healer. Which kinda reminds me of the stacking bloodlust/vamp embrace situation all over again that was in bc.<br />
<br />
i thought your suposta take the player, and not THE CLASS. Your forcing us to take the class again. HI WAKE UP?</div></div><hr />

I'm not sure what games you are referencing, but from what I have seen over the last 8 years in games I have played the ability to get mana back was made way easier not harder. UO introduced gear that replenished mana. DAoC introduced power font. In both games healing was done 10x better than it is in WoW and now WoW wants to make healing harder.</div></div><hr />

If this starts burning on PvE tankadins, there is gonna be so much outcry about it. As if we didn't have enough mana problems as it is....<br />
<br />
<br />
So true. With redoubt and holy shield up I'm at around 120% avoidance. They are almost always up and I always have BoS up. I still have to twist in jow and bow when I start running low on mana. Mana is a bitch when trying to spam out aggro increasing abilities as a protection paladin.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
It is the mechanics of the two classes. Chain heal doesn't give a lot of over healing because it is the original smart heal. It heals the first target then two other targets that actually need healing. On the other hand paladins have a glyph that is 100% over healing if it is not needed and their mechanic is to spam a 18k heal on the tank rather it is needed or not. Paladins should be on the top of over healing meters if they are doing their job correctly. Learn the difference in the classes before you post stupidity.</div></div><hr />

<br />
not to mention, pallys basicaly have 2 heals, a BIG heal and a SMALL heal. if someones hp is down 8k, a 17000 holy light will over heal. <br />
which is what will most likely be cast by the pally, the small heal would take 3+ to heal/catch up to dmg being done.<br />
<br />
pallys over heal by not only their glyphs but also their lack of diverse heals. its either go big, or go small.</div></div><hr />

Knocking the shit out of OoFSR regen pretty much erases the difference between a good holy priest and a bad holy priest.<br />
<br />
In an encounter that allows it I tell my 10s healing partner to pick it up for a few seconds while I pop a shadowfiend and inner focus and allow my mana to shoot back to the acceptable range, now I might as well not bother. <br />
<br />
Now I'll be popping IF on CD, might as well macro it into my heals as it's situational value when to crap. Rolling out hots, PoM and a few other tricks and taking that 5 seconds if i could spare to let a tick of OoFSR go through was an accomplishment and it made me good at what I do.<br />
<br />
Now the non-stop spamming priest hollering for innervates won't notice a dip in performance, where as I will. <br />

I'm not gonna reroll or anything that silly, but it looks like the skill just got taken out of holy priest-ing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Please don't spout out stupidity. Nerfing tanks is a bad idea. Tanks just started to get played on a decent level with WotLK because they no longer felt underpowered. They are still extremely stressful to play and the one role that has to carry the other raiders. If you nerf tanks then you will have a tank shortage to the point that most guilds won't even be raiding anymore.</div></div><hr />

<br />
How quickly you forget that life tap in and of itself doesn't make mana. It turns health to mana. Now, as a healer with mana issues, I'm not about to heal you when you life tap if it means I can't heal the rest of the raid when its needed so I hope you like life drain. <br />

The very fact that priests are designed to be DPS or HEALING makes them a HYBRID. They shouldn't show up to raids, tell everyone they are a priest, and suddenly destroy the meters and be the best healers in the game. You are absolutely moronic if you think they should.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Paladins that are holy don't spam flash of light anymore. They spam holy light because holy light has the glyph which will also heal the melee around the boss. Beacon of Light makes it even more viable to spam holy light, because even if 50% of it is an over heal on one target, the healing might be needed on the beacon target. Paladins are designed to top the over healing meters. If they are not topping the over healing meters then either they aren't doing their job or the person that is topping the meters instead needs to learn to heal efficiently.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What the hell do they think they are doing?<br />
<br />
Yes, a Holy Paladin's mana regeneration has become WAY to powerful... it just can't be for real that for example I start healing both MC-Tanks on Razuvious alone, starting the fight with 25k Mana and leaving it with 20k. The same goes for more or less any healer nowadays, but Paladins are the best example.<br />
<br />
BUT!<br />
<br />
If they think (and I totally agree) that mana regeneration is so powerful as to trivialize any encounter (seems to be one of those new Blizzard mantras - &quot;trivializing things&quot;, as if it were us bad bad players who trivialize it), then WHY THE HELL don't they nerf mana regeneration? Why do they nerf healing output?<br />
<br />
As of now, it is almost impossible to heal against the damage that 2 DDs do in Arenas and literally impossible if there's any MS-effect involved. Why the hell do they give Paladins (who are for the first time not the oom-healing-class in Arena-PvP) a f***ing self-MS? This is so absurd I can't even think of a way to describe it.<br />
<br />
If they want to nerf mana regen then they should do so! Change Divine Plea to return 12,5% Max-mana instead of 25% =&gt; There's your nerf to mana regen. I could very well live with that! I have way too much mana regen, nerf me! No problem! But nerf what you think you have to nerf, not something else that completely destroys ANY regen I have in PvP, putting Holy Paladins back to square one, back to where we were in mid/late BC.<br />
<br />
And if you fear of Tanks and Rets going oom - change the mana cost of their spells and abilities. What's the problem???<br />
<br />
Sry for just venting, I know this hasn't been very constructive, but the idiocy of it all pisses me off, and it even more pisses me off that as a German player I can't even translate this in a more constructive post tomorrow with at least the chance to convey my thoughts to Blizzard! Our CM's will never ever even think of collecting feedback, translating it and sending it over to those who are actually making the decisions! Not even if you give it to them bilingually, providing the english translation yourself.<br />

It is a back door nerf to life tap, as healers don't have the spare mana to heal your lifetapping, you better not life tap as you will get yelled at for wasting the healers mana. So it nerfs your life tap to being unsuable as you will not get healed when you do it.</div></div><hr />

As for SA change. Wonder why didn't they mention Retri paladins. If they gonna nerf SA for retri as well, then it's gonna gimp their dps even more. Oh, and back to divine plea: PvP or solo PvE, ret pallys have to heal themselves too. And in solo situations you kinda have hard time of getting mana from SA and on top of that you can't actually heal yourself now because you are trying to regen mana to do damage.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">HolyLiaison</div><div class="date">2009-02-06, 02:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">These changes are ultimately being done to bring the different healing classes more in line with each other as well as to give the encounter team more leeway when designing encounters, who can balance with these new mana regeneration numbers in mind. In a world with infinite healer mana, the only way to challenge healers is with increasingly insane amount of raid damage, so that global cooldowns become the limiting factor since mana fails to be. An example is the Eredar Twins in late Sunwell. We weren’t necessarily happy with that model, and this change hopefully allows us to move towards giving healing a more deliberate and thoughtful pace rather than frenetic spam.<br />
<br />
That blows my mind!<br />
<br />
They can't make harder encounters due to healers having unlimited mana? I don't see how that should have any effect on how hard an encounter can/should be. Blizzard just needs to get off their lazy ass and make encounters harder ATTENTION-wise. Fights that require coordination from the whole raid, etc.<br />
<br />
This is just....wow.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Drunkié</div><div class="date">2009-02-06, 02:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well as a Paladin, retribution main specced, and Holy secondary I have a word or two to say.<br />
<br />
as retri, mana regen isn't a problem.. Yes, I want to do as much damage as possible and spamming every spell in a well thought out rotation will still use up ALL of my mana, even if i include Divine Plea. However if the fight hasn't ended i simply use Seal of wisdom and calm down on the magic spells (basically concecration and hammer of wrath. etc) and use the melee attacks (we have three that give the mana gain effect - including the weapon swing) and the judgements every CD i am soon at full mana especially if there are 4 or more mobs.<br />
<br />
I would say I am almost always top of DPS meters (3.1k sustained, seeing a max of 5.4k at one crazy stage with bloodlust and every available proc and CD on a boss fight), not that it matters to me, getting through the instance as a group is more important for tastey loot, and being a good friendly mannered player so I can then benefit more from the fruits of labouring in WoW, because i then get invited back to gorups.<br />
<br />
I only have 2/5 T7 items.. But i read up..<br />
<br />
As far as the Holy healing horror of hell goes.. It is very much needed due to the extreme lack of healers around. At times yes, I laugh at the amount of overhealing done, reaching the 50% mark at times with 5 healers in the group (HC VoA) and Yes, even with no T7 items in heroic or 10 man naxx items, i rarely go out of mana, I love Dvine Plea, I time it well with Avenging wrath (on first CD obviously) my trinket and Divine illumination (reduces spell cost by 50%) plus a well placed early, off Global CD, Arcane torrent and boom full mana regenerated during a boss fight (including Saph once or twice (10 man)).<br />
<br />
a 50% healing reduction for 15 seconds may sound harsh, but with just over 19k mana (unbuffed) the 1.1k mana every 3 seconds for 15 secinds is a tad much. why not nerf the amount of mana regenrated then? well as it is percentage base, what would be the point using it as Ret/Prot. As it is 25% of 6k = 1.5k. That over 15 seconds? in that time ive hit consecration (800+ mana) almost twice divine storm twice and crusader strike twice. <br />
<br />
So yes putting a bigger healing penalty, in my opinionanyway, wouldn't be a so terribly &quot;end of the world for Holy paladi&quot; bad idea.. It would make me think twice before using it whenever it felt necessary to top up on mana., Relying on other members to heal for 15 seconds while you gained all that mana wouldnt be so bad either, seeing as boss encounters can last up to 5 minutes.<br />
<br />
As far as this argument about Holy Light and Flash of light? pffft... I use and spam both, with a Holy shock in between em all.. I always keep the Beacon on the tank, and only direct heal him when the raid is taking no damage, flash of light is great for just topping people up, like it has been said casting 18k heals is just a waste of mana if it aint needed.. A bit of experiance in healing will tell you when is a good idea to start casting a bigger heal etc. and keeping Sacred shield up on the tanks very much so helps with the mana usage.<br />
<br />
I Don't see why peole need to QQ, flame and cry that &quot;their&quot; class is being screwed over, in every single change they have made in the paladin i have never been seen as useless or not needed. Granted this is my only high level char (level 60 DK the closest) and have no idea how bad.good it is for others. but if it's like this for Paladins, why is it different for everyone else?<br />
<br />
Seriously it's entertainment, not life.<br />

<br />
I like to heal but i understand that some healers maybe want to feel more involved and not just look at hp bars, a running joke i would throw around is if anything strange or out of the ordinary happened in raid is that i missed it cus i was too busy keep the bars green. <br />
<br />
My mana regen may seem &quot;trivial&quot; but thats only because the rest of my raid is well geared and are taking less damage thus my mana regen has a bit more time to sink in since less damage is taken but I assure you when i started healing naxx 25 with T6 and heroic gear my mana regen was tight and i couldnt heal at my best since mana was limited.<br />
<br />
TLDR version: Healers sacrifice alot, not only fun but we sometimes cant experience certain fight mechanics since we're healing and thats it, why add to a healers burden by also forcing us to look at the blue bar while im looking at your green one.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nailertn</div><div class="date">2009-02-06, 09:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">They can't make harder encounters due to healers having unlimited mana? I don't see how that should have any effect on how hard an encounter can/should be. Blizzard just needs to get off their lazy ass and make encounters harder ATTENTION-wise. Fights that require coordination from the whole raid, etc.<br />
<br />
This.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;The 'problem' is that DPS got numbed down so a sea pirate with a pet monkey and a hook for a left hand can play. Tanking got overhauled (read: simplified just like the DPS role) and given all new sorts of shiny toys up to even a increase in damage output. So where is Blizzard going to enforce the required benchmarks to make encounters somewhere remotely challenging? Exactly...&quot;<br />
<br />
And this.<br />
<br />
Just a few more points to add: Saying the present content is easy for healers is very subjective. Going with 6-8 and wondering why it is boring is stupid. We always go with 4 to heroics, 1.5 - 2 to normal and it is fun, for an entry level raid. Even challenging for Malygos. We have 8 healers in our guild and rotate roles so that half of us heals and the rest respecs to DPS. This solves the long standing problem of healers missing out on content / fight mechanics, brings diversity and goes well with the intended dual-specs. Merging caster and healer stats made this possible, eliminated the need to have some of your DPS / healers sit out on fights and is something Blizz got very right. <br />
Also having to take more healers to raids should not be required because this way individually they have to heal less and can regen more. It should be required because their aggregate throughput can not support the damage going around. Is not doing DPS because you are limited by your mana pool fun? No. Is not healing because you are limited by your mana pool fun? No. Not only that but it causes a wipe. Pushing your output to the maximum while avoiding raid damage is what IS fun regardless of your role. Besides just like you can't tell a healer to stop due to agro you can't tell them to stop because of mana concerns. If there is damage you heal it or the person dies and that's it. It is my firm belief that mana management if anything should be a gear and talent decision and not something you risk your tanks for.<br />
Concerning the 3 healing classes that I have played so far: Pallies did not have divine plea before WOTLK and they managed without it. Maybe divine illumination and cancel casting will get a meaning again. Maybe sneaking up to the boss and turning on auto-attack does have a point. In their case I do concede some changes are due.<br />
Druids. 1: They have either haste or crit on their gear as two inferior stats or mp5 as an utterly crap one. I don't see where Blizz is going with this spirit nerf, most of them already gem for spellpower. 2: Since they are built on HOTs they need to do more agressive proactive healing than other classes. To them proactive does not mean precasting, it means throwing those HOTs on as many likely targets as possible. Wild growth got a CD so they need to make up for it by throwing out even more heals. Thus they do - they should - spend a rather small portion of fights outside the FSR. If out of FSR regen gets a hit, druids won't be hurt badly. If in combat regen gets a hit they won't be hurt badly. They will be totally screwed. So overall I don't see the point of the changes in their case. If they find they are at near full mana when the boss goes down they either suck or they use regen trinkets where they could have swapped them for throughput ones.<br />
Shamans: They are not affected directly by these changes, on the other hand I remember all too well the stacking that Shaman Plateau was. If Blizz manages to starve healers for mana the solution will be simple. Bring another shaman. Only this time for mana tide rather than for BL/heroism. Concerning their regen all I can say is they should not be worried about it. If they are they have to give up on their throughput and since WOTLK came out I always see them at the bottom of charts save for the occassional fight that suits them best (though not nearly as well as say Najentus, Bloodboil or Twins). And I highly doubt resto shamans suck throughout our realm.<br />
All in all the forthcoming changes won't hurt healers badly and I am not worried. What does trouble me is the general path Blizz is trying to walk. There are much better ways to make encounters intense than this. If healing is boring there are too many healers in the raid and Blizz should make this clear. Basing encounters more heavily on coordination, team work, maybe even DPS performance and propagating role rotation in line with the new dual-spec feature is the way to go IMO.</div></div><hr />

They spam holy light because holy light has the glyph which will also heal the melee around the boss. Beacon of Light makes it even more viable to spam holy light, because even if 50% of it is an over heal on one target, the healing might be needed on the beacon target. Paladins are designed to top the over healing meters. If they are not topping the over healing meters then either they aren't doing their job or the person that is topping the meters instead needs to learn to heal efficiently.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also not yet mentioned in the Pally overhealing debate is Illumination - 60% mana back from the spell if crit. This is what really makes Holy Pallys best spot healers and awesome pro-active healers.<br />
<br />
I was in a Naxx pug the other day and the resto druid tried to make me look bad by posting overhealing done and using lots of caps. When noone followed his rant and some corrected him (guess he wanted me kicked), he left. The entire raid had a good laugh about it... good times. =)</div></div><hr />

Nerfing spirit will bring to a loss of importance of the FSR cheat: which will oftern lead to a mp5 stacking and a nonstop spamming. Now, THIS will make healing boring. Chaincasting Gheals, coh, PoH or whaterever we'll be supposed to spam is not funny, expecially if encounter's won't require a frenzy healing. <br />
I was used to consider a quality of the priest being able to stay as much as possible in the sweet fullregen time; which is fairly easy nowadays, being raid damage pretty poor on the whole raid in almost every encounter, sarth+3 and maybe maly25 p1, but in a later content it should not. <br />
And yes, putting some nasty enrage timers would help to force RLs' inviting less healers and make it a bit challenging. A naxx with 6 healers means that i'll be afk half the time;</div></div><hr />

Now THIS made me very angry... If such a statement is coming from a blue that supposedly should know how the game works, it just shows how totally and utterly incompetent they are. Seriously, if you as a healer throw some hots and then sit around waiting for mana (during a fight that is, before the fight it's fine to stack up blooms etc.), then you either have far too many healers in your raid or are still wiping horribly in Spider Wing...<br />

<br />
This, by now, has become quite obvious.<br />
<br />
Well, not neccessarily incompetent to be fair, but completely overburdened by the workload they have piled up with the premature release of WotLK.<br />
<br />
One other example, although yours hits the nail as well, was the Holy Light glyph change. All we Holy Paladins wanted was not to suck hard at Loken for example. No one asked for a 20y range splash heal. They gave it to us anyways, and it took any sensible Paladin about 3 trash groups in Naxx 25 to see how overpowered the glyph had become, and they hotfix-nerfed it within 48 hours. Why bother? Had they even once tested their own design change by actually raiding for about 1 hour, they could have spared themselves a lot of work and the community some rather unpleasant discussion. Is that really so much to ask - that they try out the new stuff themselves?</div></div><hr />

<br />
We stack for spirit big time, i can only list on one hand leather resto items with mp5 and to nerf spirit(again) across the board is ... fricken lame.<br />
<br />
I like to heal but i understand that some healers maybe want to feel more involved and not just look at hp bars, a running joke i would throw around is if anything strange or out of the ordinary happened in raid is that i missed it cus i was too busy keep the bars green. <br />
<br />
My mana regen may seem &quot;trivial&quot; but thats only because the rest of my raid is well geared and are taking less damage thus my mana regen has a bit more time to sink in since less damage is taken but I assure you when i started healing naxx 25 with T6 and heroic gear my mana regen was tight and i couldnt heal at my best since mana was limited.<br />
<br />
TLDR version: Healers sacrifice alot, not only fun but we sometimes cant experience certain fight mechanics since we're healing and thats it, why add to a healers burden by also forcing us to look at the blue bar while im looking at your green one.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
well said.<br />
<br />
im t7+ gear holy pally, and im typically charged with healing the mt in saph, mt or ot (depends on set up i supose) in sarth, but ive only done 2 drakes. <br />
<br />
in both these encounters, i do have to be aware of my mana, and i know that. if i couldnt use Plea, im POSITIVE i could not heal what im suposto. maybe even add patchwerk into this also. the mt dmg rate pretty much dictates that i HAVE to use holy light.<br />
<br />
so if your gonna have encounters that FORCE me to use my big heals, it only seems sound logic that i need a way to regen my mana, ie plea.<br />
<br />
with the 50% penalty to my plea i can assure you i wont be able to heal those fights now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Although I'm altogether of your opinion (e.g. that the increased penalty on DP is a very bad idea) some of your examples are coming up here a lot and I frankly don't understand what the problem is:<br />
<br />
- Sapphiron: I use DP as soon as he lifts off. There is no MT to heal and all I can do is help with topping off the group. Anyway, I really don't need to. So Sapph will be no problem even with the nerfed DP.<br />
<br />
- Malygos (been reading this as well): It is so simple it should really not be wort mentioning: DP during vortex.<br />
<br />
- Patchwerk: This one's tricky. First, your other healers will need to do more healing. I see Priests, Shamans and Druids really slacking off now that Patch poses no threat to my raid since &quot;the Pallys will do the job anyways&quot;. That's going to be gone for good. But you will be able to coordinate around DP, for instance have the Priests spamheal when you can't. They can regen when the Pally's DP is done. The times of 25man Patch with 2 Pallys healing will be over, that's for sure. But to be honest - that's a little extreme, anyway.<br />
<br />
- Sarth 3D: That's going to be the worst fight for Pallys if the DP-Nerf goes live as announced, maybe along with Kel'Thuzad. You basically can't stop healing, you have to deal with a certain length of the encounter no matter how good your DPS is, and especially Sarth screams &quot;HOLY LIGHT!&quot;. That's going to be tough. I for one have already started to set aside a mp/5 heavy gear for those long fights (gimping my spellhaste and preserving as much Int and Crit as I can), as much as it may suck to rely on this crappy stat again. Meh - bad times are bad times. At least on KT you can keep up the MT with two Pallys spamming Flash most of the time. That sucks as well, but if it makes you kill the boss I can live with it. Maybe this at least gives me a reason to roll on that crappy T7-25 Chestpiece - if it ever drops.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wow, you are an idiot.<br />
Every level 80 dreanei shaman has a base 145 spirit. I have a total of 155 spirit because i have +10 to all stats as a chest enchant. I am not gearing for spirit.<br />
Thats where my 134 mp5 from spirit comes from. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
No shaman should EVER have any gear with spirit on it, and a decent spec will get you about 350 mp5 before adding gear.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm rolling with the most common spec by the way ( http://www.talentchic.com/Restoration/Shaman )<br />
<br />
That 350 mp5 i currently have is before buffs (No water shield, no totems).<br />
And no, a decent spec does not give you 350mp5.<br />
<br />
If a decent spec gave 350mp5, could you please explain this: http://eu.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Magtheridon&amp;n=Sbé<br />
World's #1 guild resto shaman with all best in slots, sports 305 mp5 ... <br />
I'm lesser geared, my mana pool is smaller, so i need more mp5, which is why i have 350.<br />
<br />
And then, your &quot;No shaman should EVER have any gear with spirit on it&quot; is plain idiotic.<br />
I rolled with cloth boots that had spirit on them for a while, not because of the spirit but because they had better overall stats than my previous mail-no-spirit-boots. If a piece has more intelect/spellpower/haste/mp5/crit, i'm not gonna ignore it because it has spirit too.<br />
<br />
So yeah, you are an idiot.</div></div><hr />

I have cleared 25/10 Naxx, Sarth, Maly etc. We normally 2 heal 10 man Naxx (Shaman &amp; Myself) and Malygos for 10 Man. Most fights I dont have to worry about mana, cept Patch, Maly, and Saph (healing for Kel is a joke compared to Saph IMO). Raid buffed I have 1500mp5 OO5SR and about 450ish while casting. On the hard fights I rely heavily on 1 mana potion &amp; innervate to get me through all the healing that I have to do. I am hardly ever outside of the 5 second rule as a tree druid because I am constantly renewing my lifebloom stacks, or raid healing. I have 1350 spirit self buffed and about 2100 spellpower.

No for the most part i don't think that mana regen is a big problem. Currently i only really do 10 man content and really the only fight were mana becomes a large issue is 10 man Sapphiron. My gear is not bad most being from 10 man instances and yes i boost spirit a lot in my gear so i tend not to run out of mana. I dont want this to be a qq post because i do belive the fear is a valid one especially since blizz has said many times that content will be a lot more chalenging come 3.1 release. If this is true i would like to know how i will balance my mana consumption through casting while still keeping all my raid members alive. At the current point as i previously said and others have stated the same issue sapphiron really is the only fight many people have problems with, yet if not spirit based regen then how will i last through the fights with basically no other changes to my class to help with regen. blizz has said that my running out of mana is a skill issue in knowing what heals to use, if this is true i would like to be told how to keep members alive during raids whilst not having proper regen and how they expect us to do this. I enjoy healing although a lot of the time it is not a challenge to me but still i love what i do. Uldar is suposed to test healers and I'm a little miffed at how i am to contend with harder content on a 10 man raid scale if they are taking away a big part of how i handle massive damage in raids. I really would like to know how to handle this better or how to take a different approach to my healing and would love suggestions on how to prepare for the change now so i am not taken by surprise when 3.1 hits.</div></div><hr />
