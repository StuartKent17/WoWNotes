<br />
If those guilds are smart, even a little bit, they won't release vids until the true competition is over.<br />
<br />
Wonder how ppl in Ensidia feel about their own decision on rushing all bosses to get a normal mode kill of Yogg... and now watching all others doing the hard modes 1st... and not only that, but also trying to reach Algalon 1st.<br />
<br />
Lets consider de fact that Blizzard alread stated long ago that the normal mode, for both 10 and 25 raid, isn't for the top guilds, but for &quot;casual&quot; players (both slow paced and &quot;less skilled&quot; types). Blizzard decided to test guilds like Ensidia with Algalon &quot;the raid destroyer&quot; and some of those hard modes...<br />
<br />
That's why all of sudden, ppl didn't care that much about Yogg 1st kill on normal... I guess in the end, we all expected that the top guilds would kill him on normal in 1 or 2 days and know that things to look for are hard modes + algalon, and maybe, 1st guy to get the Legendary formed.</div></div><hr />

Non-hard mode Yogg isn't even CLOSE to the end of the instances' progression so I really wonder why they didn't take their time and try to work out a few of the hard mode strats for their inevitable push for world first Algalon. Maybe they're doing the hard modes on alts? Who knows . . . but it seems like some serious time mismanagement to me. <br />

&quot;I love how all the guilds doing Ulduar are doing Ulduar&quot; .. nothing is being stated here.<br />
<br />
Also complaining about anyone else is a bit rich, when those like above have spent the past 6 months whining it is too easy. Ultimately these types of players are not beneficial for the game because they will take their 'world' firsts, then take a holiday and desert the game.<br />
<br />
The 'world first' network is like a self-indulgent PR/welfare system for people who need to be reassured of competition in what is a non-pvp non-competitive game mode. It's not hardcore to need to achieve in 'co-op', there is no deathmatch there.</div></div><hr />

Well isn't that nice. I mean, it couldn't possibly be that us Americans care more about real life than a video game.

I know this might come as a shock but maybe they got tired of proving how 1337 they are time and time again and are actually working to get their members geared now instead of trying to prove the size of their virtual epeen. Its Ensidia, they have proven the size of their epeen for years now. After awhile, all this &quot;omg I'm so impressed you must be gods because you gave one week of your life to a video game during its most poorly balanced state&quot; has to get old.<br />
<br />
Let us not forget that there is a LONG history of these guilds, dating all the way back to Vanilla (where world first guilds walked through walls ffs), EXPLOITING every single possible bug that they could find on the PTR INSTEAD OF REPORTING THEM and then once they get through the content using all the bugs they either release that bug on Youtube so that it will get noticed and corrected or they directly report it themselves. I'd love to see a gm tag along incognito on one of these &quot;world first&quot; kills and see how fast these guilds get banned out of the game.</div></div><hr />

I totally agree here. You won't see these people after this month. They won't be paying for the game after this month. They won't give a damn after this month. The rest of us are left to pay for the game until the next expansion so they can come farm the PTR then the World Firsts then &quot;brag&quot; about it. In the end, the competition is only there for the people that actually give a damn. I'm personally not one of those people. I personally chose to let Blizzard test its own craptastic &quot;content&quot; instead of farming out progression on the PTR for no reward other than that it might help you get some bosses down faster on live. You tell me how the fight works and give me three attempts and I can pretty much guarantee you I'm not the one screwing up to begin with.</div></div><hr />

I mean, it couldn't possibly be that us Americans care more about real life than a video game. Then again, if I was from a country where every one of your leaders kissed our president's arse at every single turn I'd focus more on my progression in a video game than the actual life I led as well.<br />

<br />
if i'd live in a country which had a warbringer, torturer and liar for president for 8 years, i'd shut the fuck up about other countries.</div></div><hr />

From what ive read Nihilum kept farming BT every week for glaives (even after SWP release / clear, gz cloze). <br />
<br />
From what ive read Nilhilum kept farming SWP for the bow (which they got a few times).<br />
<br />
So as much as its interesting to see this jealousy race... why bother? <br />
<br />
<br />
Lets face it: You can blame nolifing, PTR rolling or whatever you want. They get world first kills and you dont. That gives you two choices; Start competing for the best or stop crying about the best. How they spend their gametime and enjoy their game is up to them. Creating lies just to think higher of yourself isnt gonna help anyone, least of all yourself.</div></div><hr />

You do realise these kind of guilds actualy do allot more for blizz then run in an instance, wack bosses claim world 1st right ? Nihilum/sk gaming/ for the horde and many more (chimaera on my server) are THE top guilds. They keep clearing the contant week after week to get al the BiS gear. Besides that most of em are very active as it comes to pvp. And i totaly agree with a poster above me. Stop whining , you wanna be world first ? l2play and make an apply for ensidia/for the horde / promenition or wich ever you choose. Are you not good enough to get in ? Let the pro's do the work, like figure out the bugs and make sure scrubs like you can clear stuff aswell after 15nerfs<br />

edit: sorry for the horrible grammar english is not my native laguage.</div></div><hr />

Update: Checked armory... he/she's sporting CG/WD as CQC Combat spec. So it must be a &quot;look at me, I have glaives&quot;. Meh... I suppose if I was getting world first hardmode stuff I'd show off too. Gratz to all of them.</div></div><hr />
