WoW Classic Demo Playtime Limit and Cooldown<br />
Playing the Classic Demo<br />
When the World of Warcraft: Classic demo becomes available to play at home on Friday, November 2, we will ensure maximum availability to players at home by initially establishing session limits.<br />
<br />
When the demo goes live, we’ll use a playtime time limit and a cooldown (that starts when you first log in) to help as many people as possible play the Classic demo as much as possible. We’ll start with a playtime limit of a cumulative 60 minutes and a cooldown of 90 minutes. Here are some examples of how that might work:<br />
<br />
<br />
If you play for 30 minutes and then log off for 60 minutes, when you come back you’ll have a fresh 60 minutes.<br />
If you play for 60 minutes, you’ll be disconnected and then have to wait 30 minutes before you can play again.<br />
If you play for 20 minutes, log off for 20 minutes, then play 40 more minutes, you’ll be logged off and wait 10 more minutes.<br />
<br />
Our goal is to lift session limits as quickly as we feasibly can after the demo goes live. We will then only reinstate session limits if unexpectedly high demand returns.<br />
<br />
We will update this post with further information on this, as necessary.<br />
<br />
Thank you!</div></div><hr />

I didn't, the demo was taking me over the edge of buying the virtual ticket, 40 for only watching the show is a bit too much for me, so the demo was an extra and took me over the edge to buy the virtual ticket. So yea I said it wrong in my first post, probably because I'm surprised...! If you look at my post history you can see that I'm 99% positive about Blizzard.</div></div><hr />

Don't you have a single friend that would watch Blizzcon with you? I invited 2 friends of me to my house and I paid for the Virtual Ticket while my friends pay for snacks and drinks.</div></div><hr />

You're not banned from using the demo once the 60 minutes are up. This usage timer was put in place because they probably have a limited space on their limited number of servers that are being dedicated to the classic demo. Not to mention you start at level 15, can reach level 19, and only able to play in two zones (one for Alliance and one for Horde). That hour is more than enough in one sitting to get a feel for the demo. If you want to experience more, wait until your timer resets and play some more.</div></div><hr />

Understood. Well, HOPEFULLY it will only be a madhouse right when it launches but after that they will lift the time limit and you'll get a good amount of time playing it!<br />
<br />
While I agree with the folks saying that Blizzard should have been upfront about the time limit right away (and more than just small print), at the end the of the day most would do with learning how to &quot;delay gratification&quot; and not pay this much money to demo a 14 year old game. That is, if that is the sole reason to buy the VT.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So you rather want to watch long as fuck que after opening ceremony and don't play at all? They probably increase time 1-2 days after Friday when people get bored.<br />
<br />
And I really hope people won't bitch to the point that Blizzard would never want do this again. Imagine if next year they would give 9.0 demo with new class to play few days after Blizzcon.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You mean he'll have time to do one quest, walk across the zone to turn it in, pick up a quest to talk to a guy on the other side of the zone. He'll walk back over to pick up another quest to get 10 items, kill about 35 mobs (eat/drink 20 times), get 6 of the needed items, and then his time will be up.<br />
<br />
Joking aside, its a demo, crying about a cooldown on a demo while they are saying that they will remove it if they can is silly.</div></div><hr />

there will be 2 zones. Hundreds of players will be playing in one of those. 20 servers will definitely not be enough.</div></div><hr />

I agree with releasing the information right away, BUT and a big BUT what if they had no plans to put the time limit in, until they realized oh crap we sold a lot more virtual tickets then we thought we would have?</div></div><hr />

To be fair, they do mention that they intend to remove the limits as soon as possible.</div></div><hr />

A demo is by nature limited, is it not?<br />
<br />
They want to ensure that attendees and virtual ticket holders have the same experience, and I'm sure they want to manage the number of players accessing the demo servers since it's running for a limited time.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EnclosedOne</div><div class="date">2018-11-01, 09:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">if you bought the ticket solely to play the demo than you're an idiot...no demo is ever worth that much money. They're doing the time limit because the demo must be shared between those at the con and those at home. they want as many people to play as is possible and they don't want a handful of people taking up the limited spots available because they refuse to get off. If you think you deserve unlimited time just because you're at home then you're just an entitled little brat</div></div><hr />

<br />
Probably this is exactly what happened. That's why I think they'll will ease limitation after Blizzcon (demo will last until 8. right? don't remember right now).</div></div><hr />

<br />
-.- That is one of the major reasons why you add a time limit, what did you think you thought of something new and unheard of? It is a perfectly normal thing to do to make sure as many people as possible are able to sample the product.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's a great theory. But this is like saying you can watch any new release for free when it airs on FX in a few years.... when you a buy movie ticket you are actually buying the opportunity to sit in the dark for 2 hours.<br />
<br />
The Virtual Ticket is sold to give you access to Blizzcon stages and show. The fact that you can get the info elsewhere is moot. Other things that come with the VT are promo items to sweeten the pot. If you have NO interest in watching Blizzcon and you spend that kind of money on the very insignificant perks that are add-ons... then it's hard to have sympathy when those perks aren't as awesome as you wanted them to be.<br />
<br />
It's like marrying a woman because she tells you she is rich and you find out she isn't -- and then you're mad at her. You have only yourself to blame for &quot;marrying for the wrong reasons.&quot; Rich metaphor, I know.<br />
<br />

Classic isn't exactly the same as Vanilla. Classic will have widescreen resolution and several other quality of life changes (in the background). People want to see how Blizzard is going to present Classic as a &quot;new&quot; game; we know how they presented Vanilla already. Still, I wouldn't pay $50 for a demo, especially b/c it's time-limited; if BlizzCon gave an Alpha/Beta test buy-in, I might be interested.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard have high demand and want to make sure everyone will get a chance to try it out. They aren't gonna invest in a whole bunch of new server hardware to host something just for few days. And those limits aren't that strict, you can play for 1 hour every 90 minutes, that gives you 16 hours a day to play.<br />
<br />
<br />
Can't believe people would pay $50,- to play this while u can play plenty of private servers.. :confused:<br />

That was my plan, just boot up my server, invite a friend and play vanilla. But I got my ticket for spending 5 hours on facebook streams so I'm gonna play the demo during breaks between panels I wanna watch.</div></div><hr />

As a game dev I used to buy the ticket to see what they say about their design philosophy and other tips &amp; tricks. But lately they just lie and tell you a story that sounds good. Lost any interest in their fluff pieces they showcase like it's a new wheel when they can't even implement a proper mm algorithm in their games anymore. Let's not forget about the panels about women for some reason, as if we don't see them around in real life. <br />
<br />
Until they do something noteworthy or revolutionary, it's a pass on the ticket. If i want to be lied to I'll just watch some ads on tv.</div></div><hr />

That hour is more than enough in one sitting to get a feel for the demo. If you want to experience more, wait until your timer resets and play some more.<br />

It does disrupt if you want to play with friends though. To do something else every 60 minutes and then regroup isn't that fun.<br />
<br />
Couldn't they just increase the realms?<br />
I mean they'll need enough realms anyways when it actually goes live.</div></div><hr />

Maybe they're just trying to sabotage this to then be able to say &quot; see ? we told you that you wouldn't like this. &quot; and the move forward with their &quot;pristine server&quot; idea where you just level slowly without heirlooms etc.</div></div><hr />

Would it be that hard to add more servers so more people could play then?<br />
<br />
Firstly, if I watch streams, I have to watch whatever the person running the stream is watching. If I want to be able to switch back and forth between stages, I'd need to load up multiple streams and jump between them. Secondly, if I want to actually support Blizzard and say, &quot;Hey, I like BlizzCon, please continue doing it.&quot; then I'm going to pay. Thirdly, getting the digital goodies and access to demos and the like is also a big reason why I buy it, but not the only reason.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Here is the thing.<br />
<br />
<br />
example lets say 10,000 people are all interested on playing on 1 realm.<br />
<br />
at launch those 10,000 people will all want to play AT LAUNCH and in the (example) 5 starting zones (5 to make numbers easier)<br />
now that means those 10,000 people split over 5 zones means 2000 people per zone ALL AT ONCE that, that is impossible to manage, server wise, and mechanics wise.<br />
<br />
now split it up with demo limits and it is suddenly 2000 people per zone OVER a 10 hour period, meaning 200 per zone, ALOT more managable.<br />
and on live for example, at first it will be very, very rough, but as weeks pass on and suddenly the 5 zones become 50 zones they are split across, and instead of all playing at once, they are playing over an entire day, it will become about 50 people per zone, easily.</div></div><hr />

But this is like saying you can watch any new release for free when it airs on FX in a few years.... when you a buy movie ticket you are actually buying the opportunity to sit in the dark for 2 hours.<br />
<br />
The Virtual Ticket is sold to give you access to Blizzcon stages and show. The fact that you can get the info elsewhere is moot. Other things that come with the VT are promo items to sweeten the pot. If you have NO interest in watching Blizzcon and you spend that kind of money on the very insignificant perks that are add-ons... then it's hard to have sympathy when those perks aren't as awesome as you wanted them to be.<br />
<br />
It's like marrying a woman because she tells you she is rich and you find out she isn't -- and then you're mad at her. You have only yourself to blame for &quot;marrying for the wrong reasons.&quot; Rich metaphor, I know.<br />
<br />
You bought the ticket for the wrong reasons. You want to blame the person who sold you the ticket when we all know you are to blame.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry you feel it's just a theory.<br />
<br />
Everyone can enjoy everything offered by the virtual ticket, aside from those perks, for free via several streams the day of. I didn't buy a virtual ticket and I'm not going to. Hope you enjoy those perks you paid for, though!</div></div><hr />

<br />
But moving on, to answer your question, you imply that you are entitled to play more by the very tone and content of your original post. You're mad because Blizzard is placing playtime limits on the demo because, surprise surprise, other people might want to play too. In order to accommodate them all, Blizzard has to keep cycling people off and on. This is how they're doing it to be as fair as possible. Especially since VT buyers have the advantage of being able to play for the whole time period as opposed to just when the demo area is open at BlizzCon itself.</div></div><hr />

Blah blah semantical nonsense. If someone bought the VT because of the demo then they fucking sold a demo with a VT. If the primary reason the person bought it was the VT then the reverse is true.<br />

Rest assured, they sold a LOT of demos that came with a virtual ticket. Just like last year they sold a bunch of mounts that happened to come with one.<br />

<br />
Then if you want to play with friends during a stupid demo then coordinate with them when THEY are able to play so you can enjoy your demo TOGETHER. Its not like you get to save your progress during the DEMO onto the live servers. A demo is just a DEMO and not meant to be hours upon hours of game play. It is meant to give you a taste for a game before you purchase it.<br />
<br />
Also FelPlague hit the nail on the head with her example. The launch or early release of the demo is going to attract thousands of people who all want to play the demo. These thousands of players will be split between 2 zones. Barrens for Horde players and Westfall for Alliance players no matter which of the 8 original races from the game (6 starting zones) you chose. There will be no dungeons open. There will be no other zones you're able to venture off too including old Org. I don't even think WSG (the only battleground that was open to lvl 15-19 players at the time) is going to be open. All you're able to do is walk around Westfall or the Barrens doing quests or killing random shit in the zone. Oh man does this sound fun!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Rest assured, they sold a LOT of demos that came with a virtual ticket. Just like last year they sold a bunch of mounts that happened to come with one.<br />
<br />
Different people value different aspects of it and to pretend that they would sell as many VTs without additional bribes is just being deliberately obtuse.<br />
<br />
That's an interesting perspective. I don't agree with it (it kind of reminds me of the ol' author's intending meaning versus the readers' inferred meanings).

&quot;Hey, how do we get more people to watch our thing even though they learn of everything we discuss somewhere on the internet for free?&quot;<br />
&quot;Uhhhmmmm..... let's offer in-game items and access to that thing that is incredibly popular among our customers.&quot;<br />
<br />
Marketing. In its most basic form.<br />
<br />
Still doesn't mean they aren't selling Tickets with value-added items (that's the basic marketing term for this concept). If a restaurant offers a free coke with my burger it doesn't mean they are selling cokes with free burgers. You, as the buyer, can CHOOSE to look at it that way (and then be upset with when it's only a small coke). If a pet store offers free leashes when you buy a dog, it does not mean they are selling leashes that come with a free dog.<br />
<br />
They are selling tickets. It doesn't matter what comes with those tickets -- a short demo, an in-game mount, or a new boat -- the thing they are selling is the ticket. That is what you are buying. If you -- the royal you -- buy that ticket for motives other than enjoying what that ticket offers and then are disappointed with the &quot;extras&quot; then I cannot have much sympathy for you.</div></div><hr />

Its not like you get to save your progress during the DEMO onto the live servers. A demo is just a DEMO and not meant to be hours upon hours of game play. It is meant to give you a taste for a game before you purchase it.<br />
<br />
Also FelPlague hit the nail on the head with her example. The launch or early release of the demo is going to attract thousands of people who all want to play the demo. These thousands of players will be split between 2 zones. Barrens for Horde players and Westfall for Alliance players no matter which of the 8 original races from the game (6 starting zones) you chose. There will be no dungeons open. There will be no other zones you're able to venture off too including old Org. I don't even think WSG (the only battleground that was open to lvl 15-19 players at the time) is going to be open. All you're able to do is walk around Westfall or the Barrens doing quests or killing random shit in the zone. Oh man does this sound fun!<br />
<br />
there should be no artifical limits on players, they all want genuine vanilla experience, that comes WITH the constant lags, DCs and queues. no queue - no true experience.</div></div><hr />

Ok I have my first complaint about the &quot;authenticity&quot; of classic. When I first played Vanilla shortly after launch I had bought a German EU version thinking it would have an option for English (was in Germany at the time), it did not, so I had to re-download the entire client. That took 47 agonizing hours. I just downloaded this demo in 5min. So much for the authentic experience.</div></div><hr />

I think the time restrictions are reasonable so everyone gets to try it. I did post that earlier in the thread. This was just a funny scenario in my head since someone said horde can only play Barrens.</div></div><hr />

“Shortly after the BlizzCon opening ceremony on November 2 (at or around 20:00 GMT), players will be able to download the same in-development BlizzCon WoW Classic Demo that will be playable on the show floor.&quot;<br />
<br />
I think we'll have to wait until 20:GMT ... but please prove me wrong</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Maudib</div><div class="date">2018-11-02, 12:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">if you bought the ticket solely to play the demo than you're an idiot...no demo is ever worth that much money.<br />
<br />
Not necessarily, I'm sure there are some people who want to &quot;add the experience&quot; to their WoW collection. I guarantee you that there are people who bought this solely for the demo, in order to feel liek they have experienced every WoW playable option.<br />
<br />
For example &quot;I have played since Vanilla beta, and evry single release and beta since.. .including the Classic demo. Collectors are keen for that stuff. Just like people are willing to pay $100+ for a beta key... $50 to include the WoW CLassic Demo as part of your experience? It's not a stretch.<br />
<br />
<br />
As for me? That isn't appealing... I wouldn't buy the ticket anyway... and certainly not just for the demo, but I can see how many would. After seeing how Blizz intends to work the time limitations, I'd say it isn't too bad... however, I believe they are seriously underestimating just how many people want to play it and are going to have to increase the &quot;down time&quot; between play sessions. This will be a huge gripe after Blizzcon is over.</div></div><hr />

I, too, can see where he is coming from. However, you cannot be upset at Blizzard. You can only be upset at yourself.<br />
<br />
Even if you bought it just for the demo... you purchased this ticket without knowing or asking the full details. Shadiness or not (and I will concede a fair amount of douchery on Blizzard's part) there is no reason to play the victim here.

What &quot;douchery&quot; or &quot;shadiness&quot; are you talking about? They announced in the Dev Watercooler post (that was posted to the front page of this site) that there would be a time limit on game play that would apply to both those are the convention as well as those at home back on 10/22. This wasn't news to anyone who bothered to read literally anything about it.<br />
<br />
If you bought before then and were unhappy, did you try to get a refund? Why is this news, posted on 11/1, suddenly getting you all pissy about this? The only shadiness is that coming from people who are pissed off because they either lack reading comprehension or were too lazy to look into what they purchased. Blizzard was entirely up front about the demo being time limited for almost 2 weeks now.</div></div><hr />

Not sure why you read bitterness into my post. I didn't even buy the ticket. In fact, my entire post is about not being mad at Blizzard, but being mad at yourself for not figuring it out on your own (which is the thesis of your entire rebuttal). Maybe you just skimmed my response. It's cool; it happens!<br />
<br />
Regarding the douchery: The demo was first announced when tickets were available for purchase on October 2. Nowhere in that initial post does it mention a limited time limit to play. It just says it's a limited questing experience. &quot;Once the demo is live, you’ll be able to play until 10am PST on November 8&quot; does not, to me, imply that you will only be able to play for 60 minutes at a time. I am assuming there was small print during the purchase funnel (like I said, I never bought a ticket). So nothing illegal or evil. Just... underhanded.<br />
<br />
The Dev Watercooler you speak of was published on Oct 23 (three weeks later). Even this post didn't give exact details on how limited play would work. It just said that playtime would be limited. To your point (and Blizzard's credit), they seem to honor any refund. HOWEVER, I am sure there are plenty who didn't see this post. Not everyone checks MMO-C religiously.<br />
<br />
The first post with concrete details of limited play time (which again, might be the first time someone who purchased the ticket would be seeing the message) was published yesterday... 3 days before the event.<br />
<br />
You are well within your right to believe that this wasn't underhanded and intended to get as many purchases upfront and then hope most people can't be bothered asking for a refund (this is the same business model as the ol' mail-in rebate! ... it works!). I personally believe it was shady business practice, even if wildly successful and lucrative.<br />
<br />
But, like I said, I have no skin in the game. I am just giving you my thoughts, with the information I have available to form an opinion. No emotion involved.</div></div><hr />

Apologies, that wasn't directed AT you, more just a general response to other posts quoting you. Didn't mean to seem like I was raging at you. :-) The second post on this thread is a dude all pissy about it. And others have been as well. Just struck me as odd since it has been known for a while.<br />
<br />
And 10/22 (the date listed on the actual Watercooler post) is still a week and a half prior to this announcement and most of the text of that watercooler post was directly posted to MMO-C. I would agree that a lot of people don't read MMO-C religiously (though I tend to check it a lot at work when I get bored), but I would think replying to forums a few hundred times (as the second poster has) would imply you are more than just a casual once-in-a-long-while reader/user of MMO-C. While it would have been nicer for them to spell out exactly how long the time limits were, from reading posts around here and talking to people in game since that watercooler post, most people seemed to think the limit would be closer to 15-30 minutes in game with a longer stretch out, to cycle more people through the demo. I am actually surprised it is as long as it is (60 total minutes out of every 90, basically). And as far as not stating it when first announced, as others have speculated (and it is just speculation), they might have under-estimated what kind of draw the demo was to Virtual Ticket purchases and had to implement that later on. Or, they knew and didn't mention anything. And with that point, yes, their communication could be better, but they have always been kinda shit at communicating the full scope of everything. <br />
<br />
I just find that, more and more, people are pissed off about things that Blizzard has actually mentioned previously. The whole Allied races not being immediately available thing springs to mind. When they announced BFA last year it was made clear that Allied Races would be unlocked (using rep and other things) and that it wouldn't be immediately available just by purchasing it. Yet people act as if it was stated nowhere and some great bait-and-switch by Blizzard. <br />
<br />
And don't get me wrong. I am not happy with everything that Blizzard does and think they could communicate better and earlier on a lot of things and think they have made several poor design choices, so I am not some Blizzard white-knight/fanboi or anything. Just seemed to me some of these other posters were all pissy about information that was out there if they had bothered to look. I guess I just don't find it a big enough deal to automatically think it is some conspiracy like a lot of others seem to. The posts about how &quot;Blizzard always lies to us&quot; and &quot;Blizzard is just out to make money and steal from us&quot; are, frankly, ludicrous.</div></div><hr />

Usually at any convention like this...gameplay demos are strictly limited to the convention floor. I'm fine with a limit, but if you read what I said I believe it should be 2hrs, not 1.

Again I refer you to the fact that you can only play 1 zone each for each faction, start at level 15, can't go past level 19, have no dungeons open, and can't even go into the one battleground that the characters that level could have went into during vanilla.

I'm fine with a limit, but if you read what I said I believe it should be 2hrs, not 1. And that is mainly because they likely only have 1 or 2 servers up....People having unlimited time would lag the crap outta it.<br />
<br />
I already addressed this. This is not a usual convention. Blizzcon has a very expensive virtual ticket. Not many other conventions do this so the standard rules don't apply. There is a technical limitation on a show floor that limits playtime. I am not opposed to limiting playtime BUT I think the structure of limitation in the blue post is moronic.</div></div><hr />

If the servers are stable enough, they are going to increase or remove the limit. It says that right in the post.<br />
<br />
Like what are people bitching about... it's only a short demo anyways.</div></div><hr />

I did post that earlier in the thread. This was just a funny scenario in my head since someone said horde can only play Barrens.<br />
<br />
Oh sorry then, too many idi..people, we must be nice, that just want to complain these days.</div></div><hr />
