Ruins of Theramore Preview<br />
WARNING! WARNING! - Skip this video if you don't want to see what happens to Theramore!<br />
<br />
As always, this is an early version of the area, previewed through unofficial means. This is absolutely not representative of the final version, it's just a preview. We don't have a lot of details about this area, as it is not part of the main map and could be part of a phased event. Keep in mind that the press tour did mention Theramore as a possible scenario for the pre Mists of Pandaria event. <br />

Looks like mage magic. Early guess, Jania tries to defend Theramore against the Horde, end up screwing up a spell and leveling her own town.</div></div><hr />

Yes we've come to the conclusion that its residue left over from when Jaina teleports her tower away. Dalaran crater looks exactly the same so its teleportation related.</div></div><hr />

Not all people feel like you do. Some do not intend to make monks in live at all, some will level and read quests in beta and then rush to max lvl in 18 hours once it goes live, and then some people are there to actually test stuff out, like they are supposed to, instead of playing it like it was an early acces.</div></div><hr />

I always wonder this too. I never partake in beta, because I'd rather wait for the final version when everything is ready to be played as it is meant to, than have a half-assed messy beta experience, and then a ruined unexciting final release.<br />
<br />
It's like eating the cake rather than the unprocessed flour, suger and butter separately.<br />

Each to their own of course. If people are enjoying it, all the respect from me - it is beta testing that allows me to enjoy the fine cake in the end! ;)</div></div><hr />

Seeing how the main residue is on the place the tower used to be I think Jaina was cooking up something down there, or that's Garrosh' superweapon and he got a Goblin to sneak it in and go suicide bomber</div></div><hr />

We can't let facts get in the way of anti-horde propaganda, can we? :D That was IC.<br />

No but if you were fighting for your life, and all of your loved ones were dead, what the fuck would you do? This is Jaina we're talking about, it's already been stated by Blizzard, that the Horde are going to attack Theramore. The subsequent battle with Jaina would probably be more than enough to blow up a tower and leave a purple pattern on the ground.</div></div><hr />

Anyone else think of Dalaran Crater with the mage tower gone? There isn't enough rubble present. Perhaps Jaina teleported it someplace.<br />
<br />
That make sense and perhaps they may actually release Kul Tiras (http://www.wowpedia.org/Kul_Tiras), which they promised (and forget about it) for cataclysm.<br />
But still there is a mass grave and the one with doll looks somewhat familiar.</div></div><hr />

<br />
An oriental themed expansion and they use this term? Think again, Blizzard.<br />
<br /> 
You think I'm crazy? Try someone else who didn't use the term in the wrong way and got blasted, hard.<br />

chink 1 (chngk)<br />
n.<br />
A narrow opening, such as a crack or fissure.<br />
[Probably alteration of obsolete chine, from Middle English, crack, from Old English cine.]<br />
Idiomatic expressions<br />
it's the chink in his armour: it's his weak point<br />
<br />
It is English language, if someone wants to get offended what I suggest is to grow a thicker skin.</div></div><hr />

We heard you like invites so we are giving out 100,000 more invites! but you are not gonna get one.<br />
This is a short but sweet update that we're sending an additional 100,000 invites out tonight,<br />
for a total of 200,000 Mists of Pandaria invites being sent out today. <br />
Again, it will take a while for the invites to process so we recommend keeping an eye on your games list through Battle.net Account Management<br />
, as we expect invites to continue going out into the wee hours of the night and into tomorrow.<br />
For more information on the invite process as a whole please refer back to today's earlier announcement:</div></div><hr />

<br />
It´s kinda like deadmines in westfall. or the new bosses in SFK. Most horde players have no clue that some of the bosses are involved there either. Lillian Voss is a really interesting character though. it is worth playing through the undead starter zone just to learn about her. SHe is also in EPL a bit.<br />
<br />
But really, there are a ton of bosses and encounters in the game that are set up by questing in low level zones that only one faction sees. Lillian is one of the better written characters in the game.</div></div><hr />

They are one company that usually does not make announcements early at all due to the changeability of the development process. Myself, I was in the vanilla beta, have the original collectors edition, account's fist month was November '04, signed up for the AP on October 21st, and I have yet to receive an invite. The only loophole I can see is that my account has had the odd month of inactivity due to billing addresses changing or credit card numbers changing without me able to update in time. *Shrug* It'll come sooner or later, but still annoying.</div></div><hr />

But I still find it amusing that the text still gives it away... e.g. &quot;WARNING, if you don't want to see the Ruins of Theramore, then don't watch this video.&quot;<br />
<br />
If you wanted to insulate people from the spoilers, you'd need to have a two-stage warning - with the 1st stage being a generic warning that &quot;here there be spoilers', and the 2nd stage being like what is provided now... with a hint to what the spoiler actually is.<br />
<br />
Of course, with 100k's of beta invites going out, and no NDA, this is only going to be a &quot;spoiler&quot; for a couple of days - at most.</div></div><hr />

It can also be viewed in two other ways. <br />
<br />
1. They're stress testing the shit out of the servers. <br />
2. They're too lazy to add more beta servers. <br />
<br />
<br />
Regardless of what the real reason is, people will whine/QQ/bitch like there's no tomorrow anyway. It's lose lose really.</div></div><hr />

Impossible, Jaina is the source of all that is evil, she is just toying with everyone.<br />

Well, we will keep trying (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2011/october/cupcakes.jpg).<br />
<br />
<br />
The purple stuff is arcane residue left behind from a mass teleportation, similar to the Dalaran crater. Jaina probably teleported her tower away.<br />
Question is where?<br />
Kul Tiras? (http://www.wowpedia.org/Kul_Tiras)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
It´s kinda like deadmines in westfall. or the new bosses in SFK. Most horde players have no clue that some of the bosses are involved there either. Lillian Voss is a really interesting character though. it is worth playing through the undead starter zone just to learn about her. SHe is also in EPL a bit.<br />
<br />
<br />
SFK characters esp Godfrey is more horde*orientated then alliance. The same Godfrey in worgen starting zone has a*different*personality. When he was a noble, we was well... more noble. Like the crusaders, he would rather die than getting*tainted*by some*weird*disease.* <br />
But then after the banshee queen &quot;revive&quot; him as an forsaken, like Lilian or most forsaken, he become more self-serving,*vengeful*and no longer have pride.<br />
In the undead quest zone, there is alot more*character*that does not accept themselves or simply become twisted and evil, and the val'kyr have no idea why because vrykuls doesnt change much after being undead.<br />
Of cause not all forsaken are evil or self-serving, but they*receive*alot less attention (ie:quests) for some reason.<br />
But anyways, good to see they are trying to complete some of the quest line, which end abruptly.</div></div><hr />

<br />
depends on how you want to look at it. If you would have bought D3 on release, which everybody is for the most part, then take that $60 and you're really only paying $90 for a yr of wow.<br />
<br />
for me personally, my 1 yr of wow sub is costing me about $7/month for having to &quot;pay&quot; for D3 through the annual pass. It's a win either way ONLY if you actually still play wow.</div></div><hr />
