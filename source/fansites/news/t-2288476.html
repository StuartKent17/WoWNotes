<br />
The vast majority of battle pets are just shrunken versions of larger creatures, I wouldn't expect the artists to be spending their time creating unique models for hundreds of pets every expansion. Doesn't make it any less cool to have one of these little guys though. :)</div></div><hr />

Land, kill two tentacles. Afk in one of the sticky puddles the tentacles leave behind until you have 9+ bloods. Wait for a flip. Run into the middle, kill the bloods, kill a tentacle, drag the amalgamation over them, drag it to the plate, kill it, kill tendon, repeat. Imagine his back like two halves of a basketball court, with the center line being the ridge of his back. Just don't stay on one side of the ridge for more than 5 seconds whenever you're not in the sticky puddle.</div></div><hr />

For years people asked for it, yet they ignore it. &quot;But let's add some pets so people can revisit old stuff&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Don't have to flip it anymore. Just kill 3 tentacles at the start. Kill off 2 adds then keep the other alive. Rinse and repeat for each back plate that comes off. Also you can't just sit in mid anymore. Have to keep weaving between left and right.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, you lose some of your max health when you kill one of the adds on heroic mode, so I prefer to let him roll them off. Kill three to open more holes for blood to come out, and stand in one of them. The blood adds don't get flipped off, so you can sit in the hole the tentacle adds leave and it'll root you, and just relax until you have all nine bloods up. Then kill a tentacle to spawn an add, feed it the blood, and blow it up. A lot easier than spending the entire fight dancing left and right the entire time.</div></div><hr />
