Interviews: Warcraft After Cataclysm<br />
Tom Chilton and Greg Street have been making the rounds again with interviews on IGN (http://pc.ign.com/articles/119/1191590p1.html) and Gamasutra (http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/6473/world_of_warcraft_and_life_after_.php).<br />
<br />
Patch 4.3<br />
<br />
If you add up all of the Deathwing encounter stages, it will be the longest fight in the game.<br />
Each stage of the fight will take place in a different location and offer some loot.<br />
The encounter starts at Wyrmrest Temple, progressing toward the players being on Deathwing's back while he is flying toward The Maelstrom.<br />
The new five man encounters will build up to the Deathwing fight, similar to how the Icecrown five man instances built up to the Lich King.<br />
To combat the complaints of armor always looking the same, there is a sub-lead who is in charge of guiding the art team to produce new styles not found in the game yet.<br />
<br />
<br />
After Cataclysm<br />
<br />
More armor customization could be coming in the future; Transmogrification was a solution that could be finished in time for Patch 4.3.<br />
After Patch 4.3, and the world event, the team is going to focus on keeping players entertained and enjoying the game as well as new and potentially returning players.<br />
On Mists of Pandaria: &quot;Most of the time when we do anything panda-related it's going to be a comic book or a figurine or something like that.&quot; <br />
There are more people that played World of Warcraft but no longer play World of Warcraft than currently play World of Warcraft<br />
They believe that each spec plays like a separate class, making the game feel as if there are 30 classes. <br />
Player created content is still in the back of their minds because of how well it worked in Starcraft II. Developing tools for players would take a lot of work, but the reward would be great as well.<br />
<br />
<br />

Blue Posts<br />
Worgen Mounts<br />
These mounts are mainly being added to even up the number of mounts Alliance players can get, compared to Horde players. Mount collectors and those of you interested in going for the mount achievement have been asking for this for a while, and the additional horses will address that issue.<br />
<br />
The Worgen's unique racial mount equivalent is the Running Wild skill. That's not going anywhere. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/195692/just-what-you-worgen-lovers-wanted) / Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/2601293374?page=4#67))<br />
<br />
Transmogrification: Incomplete tier sets<br />
This is going to be half the fun for a lot of people looking forward to Transmogrification; finding matching sets and combinations that look awesome together<br />
<br />
While it's too early to say for sure, it's possible that after this feature launches, there will be a number of items that people request become available to Transmogrify. We're going to monitor this feedback and hopefully be able to build on the feature based on that, however, that's not to say every item people ask for will suddenly appear in the game. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/195670/transmogrification-incomplete-tier-sets) / Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/2601293407?page=1#3))<br />
<br />
Three Talent Specs<br />
Indeed, as Xarthat said, we're still really keen for players to put a lot of thought and decision into their character's chosen talent specs.<br />
<br />
Sure, it would be handy to have more specs lined up to swap in or out when faced with a different situation, but right now we feel that your talent spec(s) should be something you choose, maybe refine over time, and hopefully pwn with. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/195663/more-specs) / Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/2601193460?page=1#8))<br />

Diablo III Beta Opt In<br />
It is almost time for Diablo III Beta, Blizzard posted another beta opt in reminder on the official blog and DiabloFans (http://www.diablofans.com/) has some additional leaked gameplay to go with the screenshots below. <br />
Interested in signing up for an advance look at Diablo’s coming invasion of Sanctuary? To be eligible to participate in the Diablo III beta test, you need an active Battle.net account with any Blizzard game title attached to it. If you don’t already have an account, it’s easy to create (http://us.battle.net/account/creation/tos.html) one. Once you’ve set up a Battle.net account, or if you’ve already got one, you can access it by visiting http://us.battle.net/en/ and clicking the Account button on the upper right. Then, to opt into the beta, just click the Games &amp; Codes section of your Account Management page, and then select the Beta Profile Settings (https://www.battle.net/account/management/beta-profile.html) option from the drop-down menu. You’ll be prompted to download the System Check beta opt-in application; running it will opt you in to the Diablo III beta. If your system specifications change, you can run the System Check application again to update your information.<br />
<br />
While running the System Check application doesn’t guarantee you a place in the Diablo III beta, we wish you luck and hope to see you in Sanctuary.<br />
<br />
FAQ:<br />
How are beta test participants selected from the opt-in pool?<br />
Beta testers are chosen according to their system specifications and other factors, including an element of luck. Our goal is to have a good variety of system types to best test compatibility.<br />
<br />
Will there be any other ways to get into the beta besides the opt-in?<br />
We’ll very likely be providing beta entry giveaways through various promotions on our sites, as well as through our official fansites. We’ll have information available on these promotions as they approach.<br />
<br />
How many players do you plan to invite to the beta test?<br />
The number of players we invite will be based on our testing needs. If during the course of testing we determine we need more players to participate, we’ll invite more.<br />
<br />
What game content will be available in the beta?<br />
You’ll be able to try out all five character classes and experience the early stages of Diablo III from the start of the game through the Skeleton King encounter. You’ll be able to interact with new and returning characters in New Tristram and fight the reawakened evils emanating from the cursed Tristram Cathedral.<br />
<br />
Will the PvP arenas be available in the beta?<br />
We don’t plan to include the PvP arenas in the beta test.<br />
<br />
How long will the beta test last?<br />
We have not determined an exact date for the end of the beta test. We will notify participants when the beta test is nearing completion.<br />
<br />
Will the Diablo III Auction House be available in the beta?<br />
We currently plan to test the functionality of the Diablo III gold-based auction house sometime after the initial beta launch.<br />
<br />
Will Mac users be able to participate in the beta?<br />
Yes, Mac users will be able to participate in the beta at the same time as Windows users.<br />

There are more people that played World of Warcraft, but no longer play World of Warcraft, than the number of people that currently play World of Warcraft. They want to lower the barrier to entry and find some way to bring back players that no longer play.<br />

This is a good point and should be reiterated so that it is removed from the current list, as it's current placement makes it appear as something Blizzard is intending to resolve when they didn't even acknowledge it. <br />

What he gave is a non-answer.<br />

Just read over what he said again. If you've read the actual interview you know that he didn't answer the question asked at all. He was asked if the rumors were over hyped and he responded by saying how they traditionally have handled the pandaren in the past.

i said that a world maker thing would be pretty cool, with like terrain editing and npc/prop/gizmo placement and such. You would be able to send down a character to the zone and make specific changes.<br />
<br />
With a tool to outline the area and make it so you can actually make a map of the zone, like the ones in game. <br />
<br />
It would be very user friendly and purely cosmetic, with servers like setup like minecraft.<br />

He responded with something along the lines of &quot;We cannot use the exact idea due to legal reasons, but it is a good idea, well keep it in the memory bank :)&quot;<br />

Ladies and gentlemen, here we have a classical non-answer. Please, don't bother with trying to read anything else into it.<br />
<br />
How is it too hard? I really don't understand how anyone can be that slow that they think the game is hard. I mean, every single boss, you just follow the tactics, and you kill it, end of story, really easy. But PvP isn't meant to be easy, it's supposed to show skill and therefore ne hard. So when you can come up with something that makes the game hard, then start saying it's hard.<br />
<br />
People quit because the game got boring, if anything PvE is far too easy right now, and PvP is unbalanced and blizzard don't seem to care at all.</div></div><hr />

I'd completely agree with you blizzard fucked up when they made Cataclysm literally it was a Cataclysm to their subs. WotLK had easy content if it was done on normal mode yes that's for sure. Now if you killed LK/YS then went strictly to hard modes you'd say it was worth it for those who are more then casual. I myself hate the Lock out system, yea it's great that 10 mans have the same loot but you took away a raid night. My guild since cata has went from 3 days of raiding down to just over 1.</div></div><hr />

<br />
well i had a lot of friends that were not very good, but they all quit because they felt the raids now were too hard and that there was no place for them to succeed because they also felt the 5 man heroics were too hard. so even if there is no need to cater to that difficulty for some guilds, other guilds lost a lot of friends and people they played with for years. Just because they felt like making a steep learning curve in comparison to WOTLK.<br />
<br />
So for some, WOTLK was more fun, and the PVP I agree, although it was very similar, just burst and death now we have smoke bomb and Ring of Frost and Heroic Leap to deal with though.</div></div><hr />

Better rewards are obviously the answer :rolleyes: I don't think they will acknowledge that accessibility isn't what lost players, but convenience. Accessibility is determined by the players, their willingness to help those they believe will help them. With much of the need to be social in this game gone, widening the gap between dungeon and raid rewards will just make the skilled, but under-geared player with low guild rep that much more inconvenient.</div></div><hr />

I know very few people who quit because anything was too hard. I know a considerable number of people who quit because they felt like they were working their ass off for something that casuals and bads could easily just clear in normal mode...so why bother?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I also think it's a joke that Chilton thinks that the content being &quot;easy&quot; in WOTLK was what is murdering WoW. It's the fact that you bait and switched all the baddies (of which, we have discovered is the majority of WoW players) to thinking they were good raiders (because they got their Kingslayer title) and then slapping them down with &quot;sorry, you need to be willing to wipe for 6 hours each week to progress&quot; and then adding &quot;oh, that's still too hard? Why don't you try some dailies?&quot;. <br />
<br />
While the high end raiders might have QQ'd their minds out that noobs were getting titles and mounts, those noobs were NOT getting heroic bosses down, and that should be the point. Easymode for idiots like 95% of the playerbase, that are EASY AS WOTLK, Hardmodes that are as hard as the dungeon creators can tune them. That would prove a successful model! Let the noobs see the content (LIKE YOU FREAKING PROMISED) and let the epeen strokers have their hardmodes and achievements to wag in each other's faces. Blizzard is going to have to do a TON to bring back the CASUAL PLAYERS that they have trashed on about as hard as they can.<br />
<br />
It is completely that you let the dogs of this game have a bone finally and then you took it away that they're all jumping ship. I'm one of those dogs, don't get me wrong, but it's NOT that the game is too easy right now! IT IS TOO HARD.<br />
<br />
My raiding guild has resorted to spending our raiding nights doing the old raids and making pretty outfits for 4.3. Firelands is out of our reach, and we're burnt out on wiping on first tier raids (even though we could probably beat them without issue now, it's enraging that we wasted so much time and so many mats and so many flasks trying to 'learn' the fights, only to spend all night wiping ANYWAY).</div></div><hr />

The ONLY good thing that came out of Wrath was Ulduar, that's it. The content was too easy (yes, even the Heroic mode content), the balance was rocky, and to even maintain the bottom level of performance, you had to put in inordinate amount of hours into the game because the content was so easy and the system was so streamlined. Tons of people keep trying to polish Wrath up and make it sound like it was fun-party-times, but polishing a flaming turd doesn't stop it from being a flaming turd.<br />
PvP is unbalanced and blizzard don't seem to care at all.If you remember season 5, season 8 or the entirety of BC, you wouldn't be saying this. Aside from the 'WTF FROST MAGE' fiasco that was rectified quite immediately, this expansion has had fantastic class balance. People need to stop being idiots and realize that World PvP, random battlegrounds and 2v2 arenas are not being balanced around for the obvious reason that it would break the game and thus, need to not be used as metrics for 'balance'.<br />
They can make it the greatest game ever in the next patch, I won't be returning. You piss off your customers since early december till now, don't expect them to resub.

Imagine something like this. You start out at an instanced version of Wyrmrest Temple in Dragonblight - similar to COT: Durnholde. You have to fight through a bunch of Deathwing's cronies - trash mobs - and then you fight Deathwing with the help of Alexstraza and company. You hurt him, maybe knock off some of his armor plates, and he flies off. Alexstraza says &quot;Heroes, he's heading towards XXXXX. Take these, and I'll send you after him.&quot; Chest full of items, and a port to the next location. Next phase, some other major npc helps you battle him in some other location.</div></div><hr />

Duh, it means 25 new daily quests to grind, 8 new vanity pets to farm and 5 new mounts like every other patch since 2009...lol.

There are more people that played World of Warcraft, but no longer play World of Warcraft, than the number of people that currently play World of Warcraft. They want to lower the barrier to entry and find some way to bring back players that no longer play. Guess that's another bit of evidence to go with the 900k sub loss that wow is not doing to grate right now. TBH i blame it on the community. If they didnt go spam the forums during wrath saying it was to easy and they wanted harder content this might not have happened. Its like today people screaming wow is to easy still and yet i bet they have not killed any of the heroic modes. Classic example of people thinking / saying they are better than they are. in this case they demand harder content they have no chance in actually doing. when they get given what they asked for and cant do it the QQ and quit. I am sure the above example is only 1 reason for sub loss out of many many more.</div></div><hr />

Well you could, you know, play the game? Learn how to play better?<br />
<br />
Heroics are there in order to give casuals something to aim towards, some kind of progress related stuff to do without a huge time commitment. Progressing through content means overcoming challenges with your friends, not a freaking epics/badges/points shop. Heroics aren't supposed to be steamrolled, deal with it.<br />
<br />
As regards to raid, raiding nowadays requires a time commitment that just dwarfs the requirements of wow classic/tbc or other mmos. (the &quot;casual player&quot; was non-existant back then, they weren't just in the target audience, nobody, from the designer to the marketeer gave a shit about them)<br />
<br />
You just login and play, without the need to farmi anything. If you think raids are hardcore exclusive you'd kill yourself if I were to tell you the ancient stories of FARMING just for one boss. Resistance gear, flasks, felwood consumables, potions, enchantments. None of these things exist anymore, and this change was made entirely for casual players.<br />
<br />
Aren't you satisfied yet? Do you really want epics that you don't even need ( because you don't even want to tackle harder content) in your mailbox? Without even trying some part of the game, that's been changed in order to accomodate the needs of people without huge ammounts of time? Namely, you?<br />
<br />
If you don't feel compelled to tackle raids for whatever reason other than the above, then welcome aboard. WOW is shit now as far as quality content goes, just in general the game is terribly boring. For everyone.<br />
<br />
They should craft better content, make it harder to make it last longer (all encompassing statement, I don't mean just raids) or make it faster.<br />
Why a harder game? Well if the cata wasn't such piss easy in the levelling phase, people would've learned how to freaking play by lvl 85, thus erasing the need of a easier endgame content, allowing the longevity to stretch further. Since they don't want to make levelling somewhat challenging for thumb users, they have to implement some kind of endgame mechanic/content to teach players how to goddamn play on their own right. 1 people istances maybe? Or hunter/priest classquests?</div></div><hr />

One thing crosses my mind, if warcraft was not losing subscribers, would they be bothering to do this. Would it still be the same old thing and what are the chances of it retuning back to the same old thing.<br />
<br />
Reguardless of what they do i honestly don't know what they would need to do in their game in order for me to go back playing, i realy feel burnt out, like i've stopped playing before but nothing i can think of can rekindle my want to play the game, they would probably need to reright/redo the game engine and put out something similar to GW2....</div></div><hr />

The ONLY good thing that came out of Wrath was Ulduar, that's it. The content was too easy (yes, even the Heroic mode content)<br />
<br />
Link your armory, with your HM kill achieves dated to when it was current content.<br />
<br />
Oh wait, you won't do that. You're just another TotalBuscuit, bitching about content when a quick armory inspection will show you never even did it.<br />

[My opinions]Path of the Titans was explained a lot only for Blizzard to tell the whole player base know that it isn't happening. A lot of people was looking forward to make their characters not be like everyone else. When am I going to change the horrible dance my priest has?<br />
<br />
Did you even listen to Chilton at BlizzCon? Path of the Titans was something you would essentially do an action every single day (In his words. &quot;It's accomplished on a day to day basis at the same rate, a casual playing for an hour will progress at the same rate as someone who invests more time&quot;) that would give bonuses that were identical to what is achieved with glyphs. They were nothing more than ANOTHER equivalent of a daily quest, which you just complained about in the same post.<br />

Hahaha. Idiots like you that got jobs at development houses are the reason the term Fake Difficulty exists and is a joke used only a punchline these days. Luckily for me, and every other person with a life who doesn't play 40 hours a week, Blizzard disagrees, and you can continue crying while I steamroll heroics and buy your precious purple gear with my points.<br />
<br />
Don't worry, when you grow up and take on the responsibilities of a grown up like the rest of us, you'll start to play games as a pass time, a hobby for entertainment, and not as a job that you can fill the void in your life with pretend items, titles or purple letters to feel like you have accomplished anything in life.</div></div><hr />

If I want to play an easy game with dungeons in it, I'd get Dungeon Siege and use cheats. Plain and simple. If I want to do the same thing everyday, I would want a job that pays real money. Sorry Blizzard, dailies is a job to do because if you want that chopper, well guess what? Do the dailies till you have 13.5k to spend for that one character. Oh you want one for your alt too? Well do the dailies to get another 13.5k for that alt! Dailies aren't fun but they are boring if you were trying to achieve something. Dailies = players will get chinese farmer's illegal gold because it lets them pass the boring dailies. Yay for in game jobs! GG Blizzard, GG. Also plosion, I agree. Most of WoW player base do not know exactly what they want. If you asked them if they want easy content or hard content, you get 4 answers. Easy, Hard, idk, and idc. Blizzard needs to do what ever they want to the game and not care about the difficulty of the dungeon.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's the reason why I stopped raiding mostly, I want to raid on a lazy Sat afternoon one week and Friday night the next, and maybe a Monday morning on a public holiday.<br />
<br />
I am looking with interest towards this raid finder option maybe it will give us the solution to this issue.<br />
<br />
Surely I can't be the only one in this boat...</div></div><hr />

Yes Arthas, we could pug you. Another thing that got people to leave are the dailies.<br />
Now Blizzard tried to fix the problems that was going on in WoTLK but it seem to backfire a little. Everything is insanely harder than they should. Th<br />
<br />
Another thing that may have caused some players to leave the game is the constant promises that don't happen. Dance Studio. Path of the Titans. Most likely new skin models for the old races. Why? We do not know. It was either it wouldn't be out in time or we're worried it will make the PvP imbalanced or what every other excuse they come up with.<br />
<br />
<br />
Raiding without a guid does not make any sense, really why would you raid without people you know? Without your friends?<br />
It's like playing a coop game with bots. (single player left 4 dead is shallow as hell for example).<br />
<br />
What blizzard needs to change in people is their egoism, they should promote cohesion between people, in order to let them forge long lasting relationships (that's what mmos are about, not the gameplay, that's shitty by definition compared to a conventional game) WHILE enjoying the content. <br />
<br />
People nowadays are all about epics, points points, and not about friendship and fun. If you play with friends you get 10 times as much fun compared to playing alone, and you improve at a much faster rate. You become better, while having fun, and getting epics.<br />
<br />
Seriously consider quitting pugging, it's not worth it. You spoil the content and your fun. Gents, realize that being in a guild doesn't mean applying for a job. That may have been the case years ago, but now there are tons of casual guilds ( read, with time restrictions, like 2 raids a week) who do well, and manage to complete normal content in a reasonable time.<br />
<br />
Dailies are there to combat chinese farmers, and to encourage players to log in every day, thus improving the chances of them socializing more. (yes they are a job sorta, but they are entirely optional so..)<br />
<br />
I agree with the last part, blizzard definitely dropped the ball as far as content goes. Quality went down, quantity went down, promises got blasted into hell.</div></div><hr />

What? Did you read the rest of my post? Fake difficulty is some kind of brainretarded trick like gating, I didn't mean that. <br />
<br />
You don't need to play 40 hours a week to enjoy this game, where would've this myth come from. <br />
<br />
<br />
Heroics are for people like YOU. If you want them to be steamrolled, well, you are doing yourself a disservice, because your are gonna end the content so fast that you will end up with nothing to do, because blizzards is so slow in delivering a fresh one for you to farm and ravage, without any heart or passion for the people you play with. <br />
That's why theres a locking system for heroic dungeons, they are meant to be a progress in a sense. In the original draft they were meant to be raids for 5 people, specifically aimed to people with less time. If you feel that this is somewhat unfair then...you are damaging yourself.<br />
<br />
I'm not even gonna comment on the last part. What do you know of me? Do you think I have all the time I want? Do you think I have zero responsibilities? What the hell is wrong with you?</div></div><hr />

Eg.<br />
<br />
•They realize some people quit because they made the content more accessible to everyone and it no longer felt elite.<br />
<br />
•Raids are significantly harder than they were in WotLK, but the rewards are not much better than heroic five man rewards. This causes a lack of motivation to raid.<br />

LOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOL! Why do I want to listen to Blizzard about what they're putting into the game? I learned not to listen to them when the whole Dance Studio BS happened. Everyone wanted that more than Path of the Titans. Both ideas got scraped though. GG. Also, TotalBiscuit can say what ever opinion about w/e content he wants. Just as much as you and I can. Also, armoy inspection? What if you got the wrong one? What if they gave you the wrong character. You are obviously not them so you are not going to know what character they did HM on. They don't have to prove you either because WoTLK is easy. I quit raiding before Uldaur. Why? Because I can. Tired of raiding. Tired of steamrolling. <br />

That was his point, you haven't done anything meaningful in Wrath so you are not allowed to voice your opinions about that content in there BECAUSE YOU NEVER DID IT.<br />
2 years ago the forums were full of: &quot;wrath is too easy wahhh waaaahh waaaaaahh&quot; and most of the time people whining didn't do the hard content or once it was outdated.<br />
<br />
If you claim Wrath was easy and yet you only played a small part you are a simple liar and a wannabe hardcore jumping on the &quot;wrath was scrubby easzy lulz&quot; bandwagon, you probably claim Vanilla was the best ever and you didn't play then either.</div></div><hr />

More or less what I meant.<br />
<br />
Back in the day, people with not that much time always had a chance to have fun, somewhat. <br />
<br />
Why? Because the content felt literarly infinite, there was always something to do, as opposed to now, we have half fanbase bored out of their mind, unable/unwilling to know eachother and overcome the content. <br />
I know I know, not every slew of content was &quot;meaningful&quot; or &quot;interesting&quot;, but that's how mmos work, they have little purpose other than carrying people around with the &quot;Carrot-on-a-stick&quot; method. Gameplay itself is mediocre, and negligible. The true selling point of this genre is it's social aspect.<br />
<br />
But now this game is multiplayer in a broader sense, meaning, you play alone with other bots, while standing in a giant lobby (orgrimmar/sw). Basically the social aspect died under the hammers of &quot;let me kill everything and get epix asap I don't have time to bother in learning the game or actually saying hi to whomever you are&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Hold on here, you claimed Wrath and its raids were easy, Naxx sure was but that is only a small part. Wrath had plenty of challenge if you wanted to ne challenged. And how on earth is Cata anything different from dailies, raids and randoms? How was BC different? Apart from the dungeon finder it was exactly like that, put down your glasses man.</div></div><hr />

I look at the game as entertainment, not life, and not something I'll defend with my life for. I'd rather Blizzard doing what ever they want with it than doing what the player base wanted. I've liked what they did with parts of the game and I don't like what they did with the game. They try hard to make everyone satisfied with the game but yet what they do is not enough.

You lost your efficiency, you could heal your leveling buddy just fine one level ago, but now you throw the same heals at him, but somehow he doesn't get healed, thanks to the bizarrely inflated health pools and next to that you're pretty much out of mana after just a few heals, where before you could keep it going and going.<br />
<br />
Before the first regen fixes and at least justice gear the game was hard at 85, even if you did normals first, once you hit heroic being a healer you could get a stroke or drop down in hysteria and curse until the sun comes up no more. I remember doing Grim Batol and just not being able to heal the damage there on the first boss, my heals were too slow, low throughput compared to the damage and couple that with some newbie mistakes it was almost guaranteed a wipe, especially moving to second boss there, with the fire shield damage and constant group aoe damage from the archers you really could go bonkers as a healer. <br />
<br />
3 of my guild friend healers quit the game there, because of that and didn't come back to this day. <br />
<br />
They fucked it up big time with the healing in Cataclysm. Every single player wants to see his character gain power not lose it, and healers lost a lot of power going from 80 to 85 thus it made the game a chore rather then a fun past time. Now in Firelands gear and even before with all the nerfs, healing is semi-fine, it's still way to stressful at some points (depending on the class) and this is not how it should be, no other class has such stress moments really.</div></div><hr />

Wrath had plenty of challenge if you wanted to ne challenged. And how on earth is Cata anything different from dailies, raids and randoms? How was BC different? Apart from the dungeon finder it was exactly like that, put down your glasses man.<br />
<br />
BC didn't have that much dailies will Sunwell came out and I never did Sunwell, why? Because my guild knew they wouldn't be able to do it and stuck with doing simple raids such as Kara and Gruul's Lair. BC you didn't look forward to doing nothing but dailies. You didn't even need to do dailies to get gold. Netherwing dailies was mostly there for rep, not gold. Mostly because they didn't want to hand out free Netherwing Drake mounts to everyone. That is what I understood by it. End of BC, WoTLK and Cata bluntly says &quot;You don't do dailies, good luck getting that chopper!&quot; Mostly because everyone has alts to make potions and do enchantments. Who said Cata was different from WoTLK? They're basically the same with different areas and you don't streamroll through dungeons in the beginning of the content as you did in WoTLK dungeons. I know people steamrolled through The Nexus in the beginning of Wrath because once you knew the fights and what to do, you can steamroll it. DPS casts aoes, paladins aoe tank, healers casts HoTs and everything is ok. That is what is easy. Blizzard got rid of CC in Wrath only to put it back in Cata. <br />
<br />
You know what I had to do to be challenged in Wrath? Tank without chest armor and leggings. Do dailies by having a big mob around me without chest armor and leggings, even on my shaman. Made things a challenge and interesting. In BC, what was challenging was the leveling. You didn't have BoAs back in BC, it made leveling an alt look discouraging because after spending months getting your first character to lvl 70, you don't feel like doing it again but it always gave someone a challenge. I have nothing to say about PvP because I don't PvP.</div></div><hr />

Well, i've been playing since vanilla, and he's right, you had Strat, Scholo, Dire maul and UBRS/LBRS (All harder than current heroics, so it was a 50/50 toss-up between wasting your time because nothing useful dropped and wasting your time because the group fell apart halfway through), farming Tyr's hand for something i can't remember anymore, and... well that was it really, aside from some ridiculous rep-grinds of course, it was truly &quot;Raid or die&quot; back then, great for the raiders (proclaiming &quot;I have T2, worship me!&quot; in IF and stuff like that), not so great for the non-raiders.<br />
<br />
Saying MC was more than tank 'n spank (With dispel-spam duty for certain classes) would be blatant lying, and the &quot;Warriors only tank, pallies/druids/shaman only heal&quot;-thing back then must have ruffled quite a few feathers back then as well, i agree that if vanilla was released right now as it was back then, we'd have an epic flop on our hands :P</div></div><hr />

OBVIOUSLY he did play it errosync (hence him expressing his disagreement with it getting slammed), and CLEARLY he liked it. It is not a fact that Ulduar was the best thing that came from Wrath, it is an opinion. I could easily give examples of a lot of other things i thought were great about Wrath. Various features like the looking for dungeon tool have been a godsend for me, I loved some of the shorter/quicker dungeons I could do during my busy week of studying, loved that I could find raid groups easily to experience end-game if I couldn't match a guild's raid schedule, loved the smoother questing experience in... oh wait... maybe I shouldn't because that would make me an idiot wouldn't it?

There was a lot of things that was good about Wrath but yet there was a lot of bad things about it too. I don't rub up saying BC was the best and WoTLK is total shit compared to it.

<br />
Accessible =/= easy. Accessible basically means =&gt; You don't have to farm for flasks,consumables,res gear etc for weeks before being &quot;ready for raiding&quot;.<br />
&quot;nothing really changed&quot; this is factually wrong, if you compare to vanilla and tbc worlds changed. <br />
&quot;You can't just pick up 10 random people and head off to a raid and expect to defeat it in WoW&quot; You can't expect to do this anywhere. You have to build a relationship with people, make them special to you. PuGs are not fit to run raids imo. There's no fun attached to them, why would you play with bots? Plus, you cannot pick 10 random people because half will be terrible, since the game does not encourage people to improve and step up their game, and does a terrible job at that during levelling, which is easy ( easy =/= fast, something can be fast but hard at the same time, we are not arguing about time here).<br />
The whole raid = elite thing is just a myth come on(if you say that you never experienced vanilla, or heard the stories about Everquest), everyone can raid if they have a pair of nights to spare. Or even afternoons. You just need to play with the right people, with your friends. Only this way you will really enjoy the content. And it will last longer too.<br />
<br />
If you don't have that much ( read little) ammount of time, you might consider playing another game. I don't mean to be offensive, but you guys have to realize that mmrpgs require timesinks along the way, and revolve around the carrot on a stick concept(you get fun eventually, but not now basically), it's in the genre description, it cannot be helped. It would be like &quot;liking the rts genre but hating the isometric pow&quot;.<br />

Ok. Maybe I insult a little or how ever much you believe but I apologize for that. I had a theory, made it years ago but never really cared for it. Mostly about people QQing about LK and Cata content. People that started to play WoW when LK didn't know much about Vanilla and BC and most of the ones I've met viewed Vanilla and BC as total shit and always bashed on those two and make WoTLK look all perfect. Not everyone is like that though, can only go based on someone's actions. He proved that theory wrong because he has been playing WoW longer than I have. If anyone haven't notice, I haven't said anything positive or negative about Vanilla. Most people view BC as boring and shitty while I look at it as &quot;I had so many stuff to do when that expansion was out...&quot; <br />
<br />
I wasn't saying something random. I guess people probably got thrown off by it. He could just tell me that BC was shit compared to Vanilla WoW and I wouldn't say anything back about it because I never played Vanilla WoW.

Maybe I insult a little or how ever much you believe but I apologize for that. I had a theory, made it years ago but never really cared for it. Mostly about people QQing about LK and Cata content. People that started to play WoW when LK didn't know much about Vanilla and BC and most of the ones I've met viewed Vanilla and BC as total shit and always bashed on those two and make WoTLK look all perfect. Not everyone is like that though, can only go based on someone's actions. He proved that theory wrong because he has been playing WoW longer than I have. If anyone haven't notice, I haven't said anything positive or negative about Vanilla. Most people view BC as boring and shitty while I look at it as &quot;I had so many stuff to do when that expansion was out...&quot; <br />
<br />
I wasn't saying something random. I guess people probably got thrown off by it. He could just tell me that BC was shit compared to Vanilla WoW and I wouldn't say anything back about it because I never played Vanilla WoW. He said I didn't do anything meaningful in Wrath and I asked what is meaningful? Raiding? Randoms? Dailies? I don't know if he was trying to or not but I felt antagonized when he commented about me doing something meaningful.<br />
<br />
The &quot;meaningful&quot; was about you claiming Wrath raids were easy, as in don't say it is easy if you didn't do ulduar + hm and later. I loved Vanilla, I loved BC, and there are a lot of good things about Cata as well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not the RAIDS - the GAME too easy. People, seriosly, go to WoWProgress and take a look at guilds who downed atleast one heroic FL boss. There are about 220k players who takes care about heroic raids - thats 2% from 11 milion player base. And if you just want to play the game - NOT to do raids or Arena - you literally have nothing to do right now. I played from BC start and that bullshit started in Wotlk - scraping out from game everything that makes it a game. Now we have only one way - rocketing in 2 weeks from 1-85, then 1 month dailies/5mans/professions, then raids, arenas or... em... nothing! Thats why i quit, i played pvp alot in BC, raided alot in Wotlk, im tired from both, and i have nothing to do in Cata. I have leveled my hunter, druid, dk and mage to 85, cleared first raids, get bored as hell and quit. And i checked my guild in Armory - only 2 people from ~40 earlier active members are playing now. <br />
<br />
P.S. And sorry for my english, not my first language. Im just tired from people who using hc Ragnaros as argument that the game are not easy. 98% players do not care about hc raids. And game is something more than 7 bosses and 7 arenas. Atleast been 3 years ago.</div></div><hr />

You will never be able to achieve this, unless you present a non interactive movie. Even if you create content that only requires people to &quot;press space to continue&quot;, with that written in blinking letters on their screen, some will fail. You have to make a cut somewhere.</div></div><hr />

That's factually true. I mean, various &quot;value of life&quot; changes ended up (combined) dumbing down the game, removing various layers that, while being literarly, a time sink, or something clumbersome, were part of the game. Just like larva injections in the zerg macro. It's not fun, it's not interesting, but it's part of the game. With autocast the entire game would feel plain. They HAVE to come up with something else to fill that slot, since they are not getting that stuff back on (that would harm people with non that much time..)</div></div><hr />

Naxx was kinda the first impression I got of LK raids. I heard Uldaur was great but heard nothing but negative about the rest. I still remember doing the dungeons for the first time when LK came out.

There is a lot of good things from Cata but kinda getting the lazy feeling from Blizzard about how soon people can kill Deathwing now. Even if it is a 80-85 expansion, would be nice to have it wait instead of rushing it. I'm thinking that patch is going to be pushed till November.<br />

Or even afternoons. You just need to play with the right people, with your friends. Only this way you will really enjoy the content.

I do believe Blizzard has said they wanted to update the lore and events in Outland and Northrend. Maybe they're doing so with Northrend in 4.3? I mean his entire goal is to take Ysera and Alexstrasza as his slaves, after all.</div></div><hr />

I was leading one of the biggest guilds on my server and they couldn't do shit in the new cata raids. Most people leveled characters to 85 and pvp or just rerolled, some tried to switch to &quot;raiding&quot; guilds but eventually left them as well. Blizz wanted people to think the raids were accessible by everyone that is true. <br />
<br />
Wow I mean what can I say &quot;biggest guild&quot; doesn't = best. If you cleared and farmed the heroics/reps then T11 was chalanging but not impossible, and let me put this to you if you buy a single player game and you finish it in a night or so wouldn't you feel a bit disapointed? T11 was accessible IF you had a brain and geared your self properly before it. Some guilds took 4 nights to clear t11 some did it in one and some like your selfs turned to pvp for the easy epics. Personally we had some wrath players in our guild that refused to farm gear in heroics cause it was blue or because they felt heroics we're beneath them or w/e they of course failed massively and had to be replaced because there was no room to carry someone that was even the slightest bit under geared or ungemmed or unenchanted etc. Now I ask you this who is the elitist the casuals who don't want to play in anything but epics or the members of my guild that got their blues, sorted gems and enchants and after some work went on to clearing t11 content in 2 nights max (all raids). The whole point of playing ANY game is the challanage I can't understand anyone that wants to down a boss/raid in 3 or 4 attempts first time there.<br />
<br />
Imo TBC was hard some raids we're accesible to me at the time and some were not I didn't mind not seeing all the raids and I felt the heroics we're well tuned some we're a bit long and could have done with having some trash removed. Overall though good expansion.<br />
<br />
Wrath content wise quests, lore, rep grinds etc all really good. Raid wise massively disapointing same with the heroics. of course everyone says it and I'm no different uld was a master piece of a raid, LK, puti and sindra pre 30% noob buff were all good encounters. The 3 new heroics they added we're good the rest was shit tbh. I mean look at totc 1 room no map no trash and a massive 4 bosses what a joke that plus the fact it was easier than uld.<br />
<br />
Cata the new quest lines etc all really good questing seems smoother than ever before and actually fun. Rep wise there's not as much cool stuff like epic fishing pole etc but it's alright. The new heroics at launch were amazing such good fun really enjoyed the content, getting to our first raids in bwd and bot also really amazing all the encounters seemed fresh and new and it felt chalanging again. Cata opened up loads of possiblities then t12 arrived... Firelands is again great content not any better than t11 though and it's well short way to short. Even if you argue that you can move to hc mode when u've clearde it I mean common it's still the same bosses. Then we have the 2 troll hcs which again are really good but wtf blizz &quot;daily random heroic&quot; wtf is random about having 2 heroics to choose from I mean lawl. I've gone back to doing the older hcs because I'm board shitless with trolls. Lack of content in t12 has been a big issue tbh sure quality is fine but would it have killed blizz to add 1 to 2 more 5 mans and 3 boss raid to 4.2.<br />
<br />
So keep going blizz give us a little more content for t13 and keep the quality where it is.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Assuming this is for real, the encounter will work one of two ways:<br />
<br />
- Instanced, thus the Northrend / Kalimdor / whatever artwork for the zones Deathwing flies over will need to be copied over and heavily modified for it to work<br />
- Phased, where you do X bosses instanced then when they're dead, you can zone to Dragonblight and start the encounter in a different phase - this would be enormously straining on world servers compared to using separate instance servers, and the zones Deathwing flies over will still need to have updated art/features for the phase your raid is in.<br />
<br />
Either way requires quite a lot of development and coding time for this single encounter, let alone the rest of the raid. And this would make it the single most epic raid encounter ever put ingame, moreso than Lich King, Illidan, KJ, Ragnaros or any other boss. As encounters go it would be absolutely amazing. I actually don't believe the game engine and instance servers would be capable of handling such an encounter as described, so I'm skeptical.</div></div><hr />

Since you (and sadly most people) clearly have zero understanding of how the game engine works, how scripting works, etc, I would expect a response like this.<br />
There is nothing epic about an on-rails scripted event in between phases.</div></div><hr />

That isn't the game being too easy that is an issue of the game lacking certain kinds of content. So far, honestly, Blizzard has been pretty bad at creating content for casual players. Daily Dungeons only help you build up gear for Raiding. Daily BGs only help you build up gear for PvP (and thank god for Rated Battlegrounds because I don't like the Arena very much). For the first time though I think Blizzard has found part of what they need for casual players in the Molten Breach. <br />
<br />
The Molten Breach feels unimportant, progression ends abruptly and the tokens feel pointless most of the time HOWEVER there is player driven individual progress and that is important. A zone that feels feels important and has long-term player-driven progression would help</div></div><hr />

There was a natural feel of progression regarding game play and the loot system from vanilla to BC. The changes made sense and the fights were a varied range of difficulties. The badge gear option was a great way for casuals to get in on some of the fun rather than them have to stick to PVP and be slaughtered there by people in T2, etc. I think one of their best moves was making the previous tier of arena gear available for BGs. It made it very easy for &quot;seasoned&quot; players to gear up alts and get going as opposed to having to farm tirelessly through content we'd been maxed out on. Wrath's content was another great shift. My BC content raiding group disassembled shortly after making some failed attempts at Naxxramas. The heroic gear grind was a much different feel and the gear obtained was kind of shitty. The transition, for a casual, felt a little off balance to me. And the balance wasn't really restored until ToC which did even more damage while seemingly done as a weak attempt to fix the growing fjord between casual and dedicated raiders. I had tons of fun in Wrath, but the social aspect became taboo. Wrath's strange reward system (kind of a bloated and meaningless revamp of the BC model) allowed so much gutter trash to invade the raiding populace and infect everyone with their drama. The teen culture who played WoW in 2005 either isn't around anymore or don't feel like plodding through content with such a vicious and mean-spirited playerbase. Say what you will about freedom of speech, thick skins, and whatever else. However, when the raiding pools began to admit the caste of morons who rolled DPS classes and spammed their way to the top of the charts, the entire sample was ruined. Now, the WoW culture is shame-based and Blizz has bumbled their way through damage control. It's not that the content sucks because pretty much every raid has some cool content in it (if not being entirely cool all together). It's simply that the playerbase is riddled with aggro, trolling, sad, angry little twerps who endless beat memes into the ground and have the sense of humor of a used tampon. Half the fools can barely string together enough words to form a sentence, much less type out &quot;Everyone ready?&quot; before a pull. I don't know what is racing through the mind of half these tweaker babies but they seem too anxious to even give a damn about the quality of their communication. Blizz resists too much with the quality players. They got sucked in by the assholes who cried, whined, and demanded certain things be changed a certain way and it threw the whole train off the tracks. I think Cataclysm is a fantastic expansion... For players other than me and my friends. The content was tuned too hard, too soon. What little content there's been. I'm not a stickler for this kind of thing; the rehash doesn't bother me too much aside from the fact I've done over 150 runs of Za/Zg on my alts now. But it feels like this expansion is merely half of a true whole and it's been a rough ride to get back to a place that makes sense anymore. I feel they're trying now and they understand that the problems exist - enough to tell us they are hiring more devs to guide the team better. But we're not there yet. And frankly, seasoned players like myself are either fed up and gone or they are well on their way. The real heat is on and I'm glad they're aware. But I don't think that the quality players who are left playing this game should spend their time shitting on each other. It's not a pissing contest and you don't need to step on the heads of other players to succeed in the game. If anything, we should keep insisting that Blizz stop giving in to people who would turn content into an exclusive boys club. Create options for every player. Make mid level raids. If Cataclysm can be used as an example - Tier 10's current difficulty would be a great intro setting for raids. Make sure the rewards they offer are meaningfully less powerful than the more difficult raids (think Firelands) or their heroic modes. Use the tried and true ladder system, not the current botched system. Badge/point gear should not somehow magically be both abysmally trivial for hardcore raiders to get AND ridiculously difficult for casuals.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Which I find strange, because I've been playing WoW since Vanilla, and this is the first time I've gotten to raid, and it's not that hard. And I've been doing dungeons since vanilla, and the heroic modes aren't any harder than pre-wrath. And when I run out of things to do on my main, I am having fun leveling my alt through nearly 60 levels of new content, including some of the most amazing low-tier quests I've ever played (punch deathwing in the face anyone?).<br />
<br />
Is this the best expansion ever? Maybe not. Was it a necessary expansion? Yes. Azeroth needed to be reworked, both for flying and for retuning the pre-60 set. Is this better than Wrath? In my opinion, yes, but I understand that's open to debate.</div></div><hr />

It's not that the content sucks because pretty much every raid has some cool content in it (if not being entirely cool all together). It's simply that the playerbase is riddled with aggro, trolling, sad, angry little twerps who endless beat memes into the ground and have the sense of humor of a used tampon. Half the fools can barely string together enough words to form a sentence, much less type out &quot;Everyone ready?&quot; before a pull. I don't know what is racing through the mind of half these tweaker babies but they seem too anxious to even give a damn about the quality of their communication.<br />
<br />
Blizz resists too much with the quality players. They got sucked in by the assholes who cried, whined, and demanded certain things be changed a certain way and it threw the whole train off the tracks. I think Cataclysm is a fantastic expansion... For players other than me and my friends. The content was tuned too hard, too soon. What little content there's been. I'm not a stickler for this kind of thing; the rehash doesn't bother me too much aside from the fact I've done over 150 runs of Za/Zg on my alts now. But it feels like this expansion is merely half of a true whole and it's been a rough ride to get back to a place that makes sense anymore.<br />
<br />
I feel they're trying now and they understand that the problems exist - enough to tell us they are hiring more devs to guide the team better. But we're not there yet. And frankly, seasoned players like myself are either fed up and gone or they are well on their way. The real heat is on and I'm glad they're aware. But I don't think that the quality players who are left playing this game should spend their time shitting on each other. It's not a pissing contest and you don't need to step on the heads of other players to succeed in the game.<br />
<br />
If anything, we should keep insisting that Blizz stop giving in to people who would turn content into an exclusive boys club. Create options for every player. Make mid level raids. If Cataclysm can be used as an example - Tier 10's current difficulty would be a great intro setting for raids. Make sure the rewards they offer are meaningfully less powerful than the more difficult raids (think Firelands) or their heroic modes. Use the tried and true ladder system, not the current botched system. Badge/point gear should not somehow magically be both abysmally trivial for hardcore raiders to get AND ridiculously difficult for casuals.<br />
<br />
Excellent post and I'm adding some formatting in hopes people will read it. I disagree about certain parts, but his ideology is sound. (at least how I read it, I could have interpreted it wrong?)<br />
<br />
To add onto the last part, I feel like the &quot;hubs&quot; that players congregate at could be a means of separating &quot;hardcore&quot; and &quot;casual&quot; players. In EQ, you would find &quot;low-end&quot; players gathering at one town, while the &quot;hardcore&quot; would commonly gather at another. There were still main towns where they all intermixed, but the majority of their time was spent apart. Separating the two player bases would help give the illusion that the casual who does well in those &quot;easy&quot; raids is actually at the &quot;top&quot; of his game, as he will be sporting the best gear among the people of the town he spends the majority of his time in.<br />
<br />
<br />
People are always complaining. They complained the BC was too &quot;spacey&quot; and that everyone's gear got upgraded too quickly, replacing all the epics people got at the end of vanilla. They complained that Wrath was too easy and too bland, and they complained that Cata was too hard and didn't add enough content.<br />
<br />
BC was the best of WoW, imo. My biggest complaints with BC were<br />
1. At release itemization was not finished, T4 gear had better stats than T5, Kara gear had better stats than T4, T4 and T5 raids were so incredibly broken that in one attempt you could be instantly wiped and another attempt the boss would sit in a corner and let you rape them. It took 2 months for them to fix it, and after that point it was pretty much perfect.<br />
2. Arena/PvP balanced effected PvE way too much. They should have separated PvP and PvE rulesets back then, and resolved a multitude of issues that have now destroyed the balance of the game's classes (instead their solution was homogenization).<br />
3. When Kael got nerfed. By far the most perfectly tuned encounter in the game. It required a diverse set of class roles, just the right amount of gear requirement, and a large learning curve that got more and more rewarding as you were able to reproduce each phase.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As a casual, PUG raids fail at the new raids so I don't see how &quot;everyone can do it&quot; really applies, every raiding guild, sure, everyone, not by far. PUG of raiders can do it too ofc, but not casuals that randomly form a raid, so it's not really that easy to raid even to this date, people that you play with are the problem.<br />
<br />
Blizzard should blame their players for making this expansion so bad, players that scam, overprice the AH, do not help you, do not teach you, do not give you a chance to improve, act like jerks, ninja on purpose because they know they are anonymous on the net, e.g. the list goes on. A fun game consists of two things, I think Blizzard generally holds up on their end, but the players I've noticed have started to behave worse since after TBC. Greedy attitudes, very rarely do I find nice social people to play with, the most important part is feeling needed and appreciated in a MMO game (and real life), otherwise it's not fun no mater what content you add to it.</div></div><hr />

Its the game itself. The questing, leveling, reputation and all the other parts of the game are very easy these days compared to previous expansions.Well, people like it usually if they dont have these time sinks and grinds but these are usually a part of an mmo, what WoW is.<br />
Also those grindy parts are also content and let it last longer. New people could need few weeks/month to reach max level. <br />
Then they still can spend quite a bit of time for farming rep, doing dungeons and what not.<br />
<br />
Today you rush in a very short time to level 85, start the 5m dungeons circus and grind your rep on that way in no time.<br />
After 1-2 weeks you can start heroics and rush through these as well. On one hand its comfortable these days, that you dont have these time sinks, but on the other hand you devour the content in no time and get bored pretty fast.<br />
Since the only thing remaining is raiding or pvp. WotLK &quot;solved&quot; that problem with pugging the raids. Just imagine gearing up in 5m dungeons without LFD and portals. How long it would take to get your gear. Also people would socialize a bit more than today.</div></div><hr />

Doesn't seem like it adds much.I *did* like AoC's 'generic' talent tree that all classes shared, where everyone could spend points for generic things like more armor, more dodge, better to-hit, etc. I could see this even being expanded to more run speed, or even an ability to move on 1% steeper slopes, jump further/higher, bonus to incoming heals, etc. I think it made the FotM calculations always a little more complex, which is good.</div></div><hr />

They'll have a hard time making it both accessible to everyone AND offering challenges to the high-enders. Most probably, they'll either make it less accessible, thus scaring off the casuals and pandering to the hardcores, or they'll make it more accessible and attract a lot of casuals back, while scaring off the hardcores. Of course, they COULD put thought into keeping everything accessible, (raids included) but adding fun, exciting, &quot;real&quot; hardmodes that makes the encounters feel different, a bit like Ulduar, but &quot;more&quot;.

<br />
I just cannot see Blizzard attempting this though as they seem to have lost the vast majority of their ability to be innovative when adding content. It's the same stuff with a slightly different flavour lately, and most responses seem to be bullshit politician answers that tell you nothing when any questions are asked in regards to content being added, but I imagine that's due to anything they say being ripped apart and shit all over by the massive amount of trolls that seem to make up the community.</div></div><hr />

This is it. The game has been taking quite the battering from trolls and people with shitty attitude. If anything, it's the elitism-approach adopted by the players that has killed it for many. Also, what Chrisisvacant wrote about communication and actually bothering stringing a sentence together is worth a mention.<br />
<br />
Blizzard and the devs are doing a decent job with the content - but these things seems to be beyond their realm of responsibility. Of course, they could do something about age restriction but I doubt they will as it would cost them more costumers.</div></div><hr />

It's not a question of whether it's too hard or not. Some of us haven't quit because it became to hard, jesus, just how dumb can Blizzard get?<br />
<br />
Cataclsym turned out to be no more than a content patch, and far less for end-game, non-hardcore players than we had previously had. If Blizzard had spent more time reading their own forums instead of deleting thread after thread at how mundane Cata had become, or reading the QQ threads here at MMO-C, maybe they would listen to the playerbase and try to improve the situation. But no, Blizzard knew best.<br />
<br />
<br />

Lolwut? Does this mean &quot;it's worse than we thought!&quot;.<br />
<br />
<br />
They realize some people quit because they made the content more accessible to everyone and it no longer felt elite.<br />
<br />
Bollocks!<br />
<br />
It's not just the casuals, its the raiders, vets, pvp'ers, all types are quitting.<br />
<br />
Content in WotLK was accessible, but in 8 months of Cata, I haven't seen one pug (apart from trash farming) on my server for Firelands, and of whats left of the 25man pve raiding guilds, christ, the top 2 guilds on my server had to join together to raid 25man before FL opened. 25man killed off a lot of people with raidlocks because you log on to raid nights only, no point in logging on for anything else for the rest of the week. Most guilds that have survived are raiding 10man, think only 1 has stayed 25man, but some of their kills were 10man. We won't go there for 5mans and the LFG debacle. The average player shouldn't be required to watch vids or read strats for 5mans, or bribing tanks/healers to shorten queues really does take the piss, even after all the nerfs.<br />
<br />
This game has become stale, boring and lacking any imagination to make the game interesting to play. 4.3 won't change this, and probably not in the next xpac either, just more of the same. Nothing I have seen thus far looks tempting to come back to WoW and Blizzard aren't doing enough to entice me to come back, whether MoP is the next expansion or not.<br />
<br />
I just don't know wtf Blizzard's thinking is on the players unsubbing since Cata's release?<br />
<br />
Either they are in denial<br />
Arrogance in their own position<br />
Incompetence<br />

The thing is, to improve WoW, you gotta realize what you are doing wrong, pretty simple logic, right? <br />
<br />
Now, pissing on your costumers, adding mounts and pet-shops, introducing things that are not of the slightest relevance regarding whether it is fun to play or not, re-hashing 5 mans and saying &quot;Suck it&quot;, having Raids being a major pain in the ass to perform and even for worse loot the before. Having all of these factors said - how can you literally be BLIND to that you lose about 1 mil subs? I mean, okay, Blizzard is a company that is out to make money - and they have been very successful, now taking away what made quality to begin with, does not add to the formula as in building success - it is rather the opposite. Because people stay loyal for a while, take the shit to the face, but at one point, they are gonna get fed-up. They are not going to do it anymore, it is literally getting boring to even bother with the hassle of the game. Do you even understand how many Subs of ppl who USED to play a lot, only remained because of social contacts in WoW? <br />
<br />
Personally, i quit because WoW had come to a certain stage, where you couldn't do a random ZG heroic, as a tank or whatever, just for the sake of short queue (not that you WANT to play a tank, but others seem to rubbish to do it) - without having a Rogue pulling 4k DPS, with insanely crude English , even clearing the god damn dungeon seemed as a feat of strength for these kind of people - and for what, some loot? Yeah well, you get the loot. And? What now? Oh you want to raid? Well, fine, pull your ass through pain in the ass content, for less rewards then before, and suck it that you are stuck with the rogue who is pulling 4k DPS in a HC. At the end of the day, if Blizzard does not smarten up - it will die. <br />
<br />
Now that might have been crazy talk before - but you got REAL threats on the horizon now. Guild Wars 2, Star Wars The Old Republic, hell even Diablo 3 will attract more people to it then WoW probably could - more accessible, new fresh content, is out there - in comparing to a game that has not aged well (WoW) - remain competitive, or you are going to get slaughtered.</div></div><hr />

This is actually from a quote from a Doug Thomas, an associate professor at USC that didn't feel like a special snowflake anymore for getting access to gear that people playing less then 30 hours a week couldn't.<br />
<br />
Further down the article you get two paragraphs from another random guide saying that his guilds blew up because of the increased diffculty (I assume in normals). Which is pretty much my experience and why none of my friends &amp; family play anymore. Asking anyone to sit at a computer for five hours on 3-4 nights a week is lunacy.</div></div><hr />

Yes they will, Blizzard will make more money by catering to the majority then to the minority of elitists. You can't please everyone, and in these cases it is a better business decision to do what the majority wants. But is seems like they are trying to please everyone which will only make everyone upset.</div></div><hr />

Top 2 things imo are: 1) Most of cata effort was put in the old kingdom revamp. This should have been done as a regular part of maintenance. The players have paid for it already with vanilla. 2) The new threat and healing models made it much harder for those roles to do their job. Unfortunately players in those were already short supply.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Randris</div><div class="date">2011-09-03, 03:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I played WoW off and on for a long time. I started in Vanilla 1.6. I stopped being very active about two years ago. Since then I've played a month or two here and there, and played my free 10-day trials Blizz has sent me, just to see if anything has changed. The simple fact for me is that every expansion ends up being the same. Sure, the tileset is different. Some mobs have different skin color. But in the end, it's still WoW.. Same old grind, day in day out. Dailies, professions, instances, PvP etc. It all just starts to blend together until it feels like a second job. It requires such a commitment just to be competitive. <br />
<br />
I'm not suggesting that they dumb the game down for &quot;casuals&quot; or whatever. But when a new expansion comes out, and I replace all of my gear within the first two levels, I ask myself &quot;What was the point of all that I just did?&quot;. Sure it was fun at first, but like everything else in WoW, once you run Naxx or whatever the 15th time, you're kind of set to auto-pilot. Everything just becomes routine. You aren't having fun anymore. <br />
<br />
By the time I did the loot/grind cycle for the third time in Wrath, I seriously started to question what I was doing. With the massive nerf to leveling, that removed all the challenge, and lack of interest in end-game grinding, I no longer found anything fun about WoW. I still sort of keep up with news (hence why I'm here), hoping that something will pique my interest as truly different. However, it hasn't happened, and I don't predict it will.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zeekua</div><div class="date">2011-09-03, 03:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">First of all, I feel the content difficulty right now is almost perfect. The normal modes feel like normal modes to me, and the heroics are actually hard. Back in Wrath, the heroic modes were WAY to easy, other than Heroic Lich King, and normal mode was something you brought your 3rd string alt's to. Look up my character, Zeeklol, for proof of my raiding history if you don't believe I did any of the content I said (looking at you amy). I think I killed more bosses on heroic in ICC then I did on normal. So basically, what I am trying to say is that the people who THINK the normal content is too hard need to step up their game. Plain and simple. The normal modes should be YOUR heroic modes and it SHOULD be hard for you. <br />
<br />
Secondly, Deathwing will be the longest encounter in the game? So it's going to be 20 minutes? Because Heroic Ragnaros is AT LEAST 15 minutes long. Longer encounters /= better encounters. <br />
<br />
Finally, I am leaving this game (hopefully) for either GW2 or SWTOR. This game has become a bore outside of raiding. I feel like, I have beaten the game and there really is nothing else to do besides that. I have leveled every single class/spec to 85 over the course of 6 years. I have seen everything this game has to offer, even twice now with the rehased garbage that's been thrown at me. Guild Wars 2 actually doesn't have a sub fee and it looks VERY promising. SWTOR is also looking like an amazing game. Blizzard should start looking at their competitors and seeing how they are changing the concept of MMO's (aka no dedicated healers/tanks in GW2 for example) and start adjusting. But that's probably what their &quot;Project Titan&quot; is doing right now. This games core concepts will never change.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What they're saying is that subscriber churn implies that they've had at least as many people (12m) play the game at one time who no longer play. For example, Washington DC might have only 500,000 inhabitants but you can bet that through its history it's been home to at least 1 million people who are different from the current residents.<br />
<br />
It's a clunky way to say it, but in a clearer way, they're saying that if everyone who'd ever played WoW was playing it right now they would have at least twice the subscribers they have now.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nepinator</div><div class="date">2011-09-03, 03:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think it was a mistake to make the loot from 10 mans and 25 mans exactly the same, as well as making them share a lockout. It's had a serious impact on 25 man raiding and most realms only have one or two 25 man guilds left. There's just no solid reason to raid 25 man anymore, you don't get superior rewards for it. There was a lot more activity in WotLK because people had the option to PuG 10 mans if their guilds main raided 25 mans, or vice versa, and there was simply more to do. Personally I think Blizzard should go back to that model as soon as possible, at least for the next expansion.<br />
<br />
<br />
It's great that they're bringing out more 5 mans in the next patch though, I'm glad they're giving that more attention. It's more accessible for the casual players (no I don't mean bad players, I mean people who don't necessarily want to commit to raiding) and it gives us something to do besides the raids, but I do miss the 10 man and 25 man raids being separate lockouts.<br />
<br />
<br />
Right now I do think the game has become a bit &quot;limited&quot; in terms of activity outside of raiding too. World PvP almost never happens nowadays and I think players need an incentive to do it, but then there's the problem of server faction balance, which is non-existent on most realms since it became possible to change factions. I was on a realm that was 50:50 Alliance/Horde, but as soon as faction changes became available 90% of the Alliance players switched over to Horde because Horde had the more progressed guilds and it attracted them over.That's gone off on a tangent but nevermind. xD<br />

No. How about normal difficulties that can be done with 1 good tank, 1 ok tank, 1 good healer, 2 ok healer, 2 good dps, and four sub-par dps, because that's what people that only raid now and then have to play with.<br />

I agree with this. If regular-mode gear is going to only be slightly better than dungeon gear, the challenge should be only slightly harder. The 'hardcores' can suck it, their complaining in Wrath has steered the designers to make content that is too hard or time-consuming for most players to bother trying it. I remember doing that worm boss in January, never did beat it because the ranged screwed up, or the tank would get eaten. Omnitron, too much going on would cause wipes at 40%. Part of the problem was that getting perfect gear was a huge time sink, so raid members with outside lives held us back. At this point, I said, &quot;I could wait for 2-3 months before we're ready to tackle this raid, or I could go play other games.&quot; So I played other games, mostly Minecraft.<br />
<br />
I think that Blizzard will have to make raids accessible again. Less time sinks, less explosive boss mechanics. As much as hardcores may hate this, the fact is that the rest of the game is getting pretty boring for everyone. If Blizz is going to spend most of their content patches on endgame (and they should, it's a lot of fun), they need to make sure everyone can enjoy them.</div></div><hr />

Oops, maybe I was too casual and too bads for the game, or perhaps even a &quot;mouthbreather&quot; (what a great WoW coined term)? Now doesn't that make me feel bad! And that wasn't elite enough? Sure, make it more elite - I think that's a mighty smart decision. ;) Looks like my dollars aren't going anywhere near Blizzard for a good while. :D<br />
<br />
Well then why are talking then. The game isn't for you, you obv made the best decision in your best interest. <br />
<br />
More people should just do what you did, realize this kind of games isn't for them (it's not a foreign concept, 400 apm code S starcraft isn't for everyone either, or even Civilization), then quit the senseless whining.<br />
<br />
Seriously, analyze yourself, ask yourself &quot;do I really want to play a &quot;game&quot; that's just one giant timesink on every aspect?&quot; &quot;Can I afford that, both in time and money?&quot; &quot;Do I cherish my ingame relationships that much?&quot; &quot;Do I enjoy spending time with these people?&quot; &quot;Do i enjoy this watered down, antiquated gameplay over more modern singleplayer rpgs? (or other genres for that matter, even mp fps)&quot;<br />
<br />
Follow these guidelines, discover if this is the game for you. If it isn't, then quit, and stop asking for a warped, zombified wow that isn't true to it's nature. <br />
<br />
Blizzard's fault so far in cata has been their pathologic lazyness. They are goddamn slow in delivering promised content (firelands was promised on ship, look it up, blizzcon 2009 I think). They prefer a quick cash in in the form of shining horses and pets, as opposed to true developed content. ( btw, shame on you if you condone this behaviour, buying pets/mounts only makes them sure that they can afford being lazy for longer). <br />
In fact blizzard didn't actually lose any money from the sub drop, they earned the deficit through VAS (value added services).<br />

<br />
But the raids are accessible, there are no attunements anymore, it's easier to gear up a new player (it's less rng related), you don't have to farm for flasks, pots , elixirs and enchants for too long. <br />
<br />
What else do you want? Accessibility is there. You can enter the dungeon, you can tackle the bosses. If your guild fails then, you have to spend more time developing it, you have to form a team, that works together, that sticks together. Teach lesser players how to play, let them discuss with more experienced ones. <br />
<br />
That's how you kill bosses, by letting people care for their team, not filthy epics. This is wat differentiates wow from say, diablo. That you have a persistent pool of people to play with, people you CARE about.<br />
<br />
Sadly, if you cannot develop such spirit, every raid you will ever do will be doomed by boredom, selfishness and greed.</div></div><hr />

I love everything about this post. I definitely feel like the majority of people complaining about content being &quot;too difficult&quot; these days either forgot what it really means to &quot;raid&quot; or perhaps they never understood it at all. It's definitely not a self-focused deal by any means. The guilds that actually succeed in wrecking content are the ones that care about gearing THE GROUP, and not individual players (unless legendaries are involved...) The fact is that Blizzard is driving this community based system away with things like the raid lfg and such. :/ And I could bet that everyone knows at least one person that belongs to a guild simply for the perks. It's really disappointing that blizzard is encouraging such selfish solitary greed.</div></div><hr />

Well honestly, if you wanted, you could make it last 30 minutes :P No enrage coupled with no raid damage = luleasymode once you hit Phase 2.<br />
<br />
and it's a longer fight because of the multiple phases, so longer, in this case, does mean better. What boss have we had before where you fight it over the course of a raid instance. Each phase looks to be fairly intensive considering they're willing to give out loot for each.</div></div><hr />

Maybe they're accessible now, but in my view, it was far too late. The guild I was in WAS tight-knit. We raided through ICC just fine. The 4.0 raids were just a terrible experience, and I don't have any urge to return yet. I think the main problem was the timesink required to get entry gear and mats...I knew tons of people who just botted to get mats while they were working. Those that didn't, caused us to wipe. We tried to be positive, but there's only so many times you can fail before the morale goes down and people go to bed because they have morning shifts.<br />
<br />
I'll admit that maybe I'm just sick of the raiding experience in general. LFR could maybe change that, by letting people raid whenever they please. Also, the Deathwing raid sounds like fun (battling him in different areas of the world), so maybe I'll be back for that. 4.0 just left a terrible taste in my mouth.</div></div><hr />

It appears he's going to be the only boss so he's just going to run away you chase and its a different encounter. You wipe you start off on the section that you left off on. Plenty of people will look at this as lack of design being only 1 boss in the raid AND there is no real dungeon, its wyrmrest, flying from wyrmrest to maelstrom, fighting at maelstrom. Maybe he has some secret domain realm thing for a heroic mode fight but yea. Think of each of his sections as different boss fights, but against enemies with the same model.</div></div><hr />

If they would just release another difficulty with better than 5 man normals, on par with 5 man heroics gear, they may find a solution. <br />

They better do something awesome, rather than just amp up the difficulty forthe exclusionist snowflakes that want me to continue to pay for them to play.<br />

Every new x-pac seems hard because all we remember is steam rolling through old content in the highest Tier sets. Does no one remember Loken when Wrath launched? Or the QQ about HoR? The biggest problem has been the merging of 10 and 25 mans. It killed many 25 man Guilds and spread the talented players among a plethora of 10 mans that have trouble beating the easy Bosses of each Tier. Make 10 mans the easy content with lesser drops and make 25's the harder content. Lose the Hard modes and bring back Ulduar style Hard mechanics.</div></div><hr />

Well to be honest, the time required to put a char up to speed, even at the beginning of cat, just dwarfed in comparison to the months needed for getting something done pre wotlk. <br />
<br />
What happened to your guild was just lack of a strong and inspiring leadership, or a clear focus on what to do and how to accomplish it. Plus I cannot phantom as how close knit you could've been, if some members needed botting in order to farm mats, or others even refused to farm outright. Usually that's not a good symptom of a coesive group, honestly.<br />
<br />
Guilds used to camp entire nights farmzones or istances together, in order to get everyone in &quot;raid ready status&quot;, even sacrificing raids. <br />
Another example may be the fact that some guilds used a taxation method to buy maths for everyone, epic mounts, all sorts of stuff.<br />
<br />
It's called investing time in your team, wow isn't a casual game in the sense that you can just login and play (what's written on the box is somewhat misleading). You are much more engaged than that, without taking time into consideration. (there's gms who login msn from work in otfrt to check on their guild status, people online, what's going on, managing the bank through other people etc).</div></div><hr />

There is nothing epic about an on-rails scripted event in between phases. <br />
No, actually you have no understanding. Boss encounters have grown progressively more and more complex since BC. Outside of KT and KJ, most BC raid encounters weren't terribly complex. Malygos and Sarth + 3, despite Naxx 2.0 being an abortion, were more complex encounters than most BC ones were. Ulduar's encounters were exceedingly well tuned and designed. Heroic TOC, as much of an abortion as the lore and quest hubs backing it were, had four very well done encounters (not considering faction champions). ICC was quite well designed and Lich King heroic was exceptionally well-tuned.<br />
<br />
Now you go into Cata and you have Al'akir (very complex encounter on heroic with many mechanics to watch for, 3-dimensional flight in phase 3), Conclave (requires raid to split into 3 distinct groups with separate roles swapping back and forth between platforms), Omnotron (wide variety of mechanics and fast-paced on heroic), Atramedes (sound mechanic turns an otherwise tank and spank boss into something interesting), Nefarian (optimal use of mind control buff required to meet soft enrage on heroic), Cho'gall (very complex and demanding encounter with multiple strategies that all work) and more. Even Paragon came out and said that T11 was by far the most difficult and demanding tier of raid content put in the game thus far. Firelands heroic bosses are equally interesting and challenging.<br />
<br />
You don't even raid current content, but like to complain about it. A brief skim of your forum posts is you crying endlessly about how the game has gone to pot and how BC was the game at its peak. &quot;BC was great. Sure it came out with bugged gear itemization and all the T5 raids were massively bugged and almost unplayable for 2 months until they finally got fixed, and I had to run the same heroic dungeons over and over for weeks and weeks to build reps up to get gear to get more gear to get even more gear, the same way as the game works now, but it was just so great. It was so great man. Casuals ruined everything.&quot;<br />
<br />
While I certainly think the vast majority of the game's playerbase are awful at progressive PVE/PVP content, you're Yet Another Nerd who rants and raves because you can't be a special snowflake anymore by sitting at your PC 15 hours a day 6 days a week grinding mobs and chaining heroics. Now people can get that level of progress by spending 4 hours a day 5 days a week. Boo-hoo. The only thing BC did better was the lore and immersion. Casual players don't have time for deep immersion, and a lot of hardcores don't give a crap about the storyline, they just want to kill heroic internet dragons.<br />
<br />
I still get to sit in Org floating on my Mount Casual Players Can't Get wearing my Heroic Gear Casual Players Can't Get, not because I nerd it and &quot;dedicate&quot; myself to spam grinding reps and mobs, hopping from guild to guild building my gear up the way many people in BC did, but because I and the people I play with are better players than most and can accomplish 12/12H T10 (at 0-5% with LK at 20), 13/13H T11 (by may) and 6/7H T12 (thus far) in 16 hours a week of raiding.<br />

The game outgrew you, cry more. Go play something else and enjoy that. You have no place to criticize the game because you haven't actively played this expansion.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, 10 man raids brought all sorts of bad stuff.<br />

As a result of them, class design was totally changed to welcome homogenization, people became less and less interested in guild related activities (that's the core of the game, socializing, pugs are an abomination belive it or not), forging more greed and selfish individuals.

<br />
What happened to your guild was just lack of a strong and inspiring leadership, or a clear focus on what to do and how to accomplish it. Plus I cannot phantom as how close knit you could've been, if some members needed botting in order to farm mats, or others even refused to farm outright. Usually that's not a good symptom of a coesive group, honestly.<br />
<br />
Guilds used to camp entire nights farmzones or istances together, in order to get everyone in &quot;raid ready status&quot;, even sacrificing raids. <br />
Another example may be the fact that some guilds used a taxation method to buy maths for everyone, epic mounts, all sorts of stuff.<br />
<br />
It's called investing time in your team, wow isn't a casual game in the sense that you can just login and play (what's written on the box is somewhat misleading). You are much more engaged than that, without taking time into consideration. (there's gms who login msn from work in otfrt to check on their guild status, people online, what's going on, managing the bank through other people etc).<br />
<br />
I know that people used to grind endlessly for tiny things like mats, because it was fresh and exciting for them. Now, most players have already done mat farming for years, and it's the same thing. It's just not very fun - not nearly as much as raiding. It's brainless too...hence the botting. For my guild, it's just a giant time barrier preventing us from doing the actual fun stuff: raiding. Same with the rep gear grinds.<br />
<br />
The fact is that the game is getting old. Blizz needs to cut down on timesinks if they want veterans to keep playing (when they eventually become causals), because most of us find it boring nowadays. Maybe they already did for 4.1 and 4.2, I wouldn't know because I've been enjoying 'casual' games with my guildies ever since 4.0. I'll be back for 4.3 to see how things are though :)</div></div><hr />

That's basically what it is, a huge boring time sink, it gets better only if you share &quot;the pain&quot; of it with other people. Wow would be a terrible, shallow, grindy game if it was single player only. The cooperation, the social part, is what makes mmorpgs special, and worth paying in order to play.<br />
<br />
Sadly everyone should ask themselves if it's worth it to go through such boring menial tasks over and over. For some it is, because it's a common, focused effort. For other it just isn't (anymore). <br />
<br />
As I said, it's part of the game, it has already been softnened quite a bit, but it's still there, for a reason. (slow down players, let them play longer, increase the longevity of current content= more people will be paying the next month)</div></div><hr />

The needed homogenization of the specs is one of the saddest victims of the move to 10 mans. 25 man Raids were a perfect size for a game that (prior to DK's) had 27 specs. With 10 mans we've had to lose the Buffer, DeBuffer and CC type specs that have been prevalent in all MMO's yet were deemed &quot;not fun&quot; by GC.

You have to fight through a bunch of Deathwing's cronies - trash mobs - and then you fight Deathwing with the help of Alexstraza and company. You hurt him, maybe knock off some of his armor plates, and he flies off. Alexstraza says &quot;Heroes, he's heading towards XXXXX. Take these, and I'll send you after him.&quot; Chest full of items, and a port to the next location. Next phase, some other major npc helps you battle him in some other location.<br />

Now that I think about it, I wouldn't be surprised if Blizzard comprises Deathwing's raid almost entirely of fighting him. From the sounds of it, there will be several &quot;phases&quot; of the fight with each one dropping loot, and the fight taking place over familiar places. If they're expecting to release 4.3 before the year end, an easy way to cut development time and money is to use the same model over and over and recycle old environments as the backdrop to your raid.</div></div><hr />

If the fight culminates at the Maelstrom I bet my left pinky it's going to be something like that, only the raid will be split between those 3-4 &quot;pillars/cliffs&quot;, helping the NPC's and killing of DW.</div></div><hr />

I can safely say that Marks and Survival Hunters are VERY similar in play, except SV is SLIGHTLY more mobile since it doesn't have Aimed Shot anywhere in its rotation, but since many go to Arcane as a Focus dump after Careful Aim, that essentially goes away for 90% of the fight and the only differences are Steady/Cobra (same thing, just nature vs. physical damage), Chimera/Explosive (same shot, just different damage yet again...though ES has a DoT, it's pretty much a random one, not a real caster-like DoT), and that SV has Black Arrow.In terms of mechanics, it's almost identical. BM is a whole different play style than the 2, but MM and SV really don't vary enough in play style to call them almost like different classes. Anyone capable of raiding can switch from SV to MM or vice versa without playing the other before and not struggle.</div></div><hr />

The ONLY good thing that came out of Wrath was Ulduar, that's it. The content was too easy (yes, even the Heroic mode content), the balance was rocky, and to even maintain the bottom level of performance, you had to put in inordinate amount of hours into the game because the content was so easy and the system was so streamlined. Tons of people keep trying to polish Wrath up and make it sound like it was fun-party-times, but polishing a flaming turd doesn't stop it from being a flaming turd.<br />
Actually, I played WotLK. All of it. It must boggle your mind to see that -- OMG -- there are people that actually liked WotLK and consider it their favorite.

This is going to be half the fun for a lot of people looking forward to Transmogrification; finding matching sets and combinations that look awesome together<br />
<br />
While it's too early to say for sure, it's possible that after this feature launches, there will be a number of items that people request become available to Transmogrify. We're going to monitor this feedback and hopefully be able to build on the feature based on that, however, that's not to say every item people ask for will suddenly appear in the game. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/195670/transmogrification-incomplete-tier-sets) / Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/2601293407?page=1#3)<br />
<br />
<br />
I sure hope they change their minds with this. EVERY one of those removed items should be re-obtainable in some way unless they are exactly the same model than an aleadry available item, glow included. I mean, at least 1 person will want it anyway.<br />
<br />
The sword Typhoon, which dropped from some world dragon, is the only one with this model with a blue glow. Harbinger of Doom, which was obtainable from old ZG I think, is a Blade of Dormant memories with a green glow. That's just a few examples: you people think that the guy who want a certain model shouldn't earn for the sole fact that most of the masses didn't asked for it?</div></div><hr />

I disagree about certain parts, but his ideology is sound. (at least how I read it, I could have interpreted it wrong?)<br />
<br />
To add onto the last part, I feel like the &quot;hubs&quot; that players congregate at could be a means of separating &quot;hardcore&quot; and &quot;casual&quot; players. In EQ, you would find &quot;low-end&quot; players gathering at one town, while the &quot;hardcore&quot; would commonly gather at another. There were still main towns where they all intermixed, but the majority of their time was spent apart. Separating the two player bases would help give the illusion that the casual who does well in those &quot;easy&quot; raids is actually at the &quot;top&quot; of his game, as he will be sporting the best gear among the people of the town he spends the majority of his time in.<br />
<br />
Yeah, sorry about the formatting. Not sure how that happened as it was formatted when I was typing it, lol. <br />
<br />
I agree with your suggestion about the separate hubs. Though I really did enjoy the epic feel of getting to your raid in Blackrock Mountain in Vanilla, the game has changed too much for that to be of any fun now as people will turn portals into BGs.</div></div><hr />

Indeed. I for one am absolutely fed up with Blizzard, right now , unless they get rid of their main marketing demograph for the entitled casual social gamers and change their attitude, there is no way I'm reactivating my account again.</div></div><hr />

Some of the stuff you credited to Chilton and Street are actually from the Gamasutra acticle writer, and his non-Blizz &quot;experts&quot;, NOT from Chilton or Street.<br />
<br />
Eg.<br />
<br />
•They realize some people quit because they made the content more accessible to everyone and it no longer felt elite.<br />
<br />
•Raids are significantly harder than they were in WotLK, but the rewards are not much better than heroic five man rewards. This causes a lack of motivation to raid.<br />
<br />
Are direct quotes of this guy: Thomas Debeauvais, of UC Irvine's Department of Informatics, who has nothing to do with Blizz.<br />
<br />
^^ This! absolutely.^^ Once I read the original articles, I finally figured out some &quot;points&quot; were totally meaningless. I could care less what the non-Blizz so-called-experts have to say. Their opinion(s) rates no higher with me than any other player. I agree, totally bad reporting.</div></div><hr />

Yes, thank you for taking out the elitist BS editorial garbage. People like that are one of the core reasons the industry is constantly struggling to break into the 100% main-stream...</div></div><hr />

It's so sad to see some of you actually take this game serious. You probably spend a third of your day just playing it. Beat a raid and know that what you have will be obsolete the next patch. It's all about some sort of bragging right about the loot you got. Quite pathetic.

Bingo. I am one such vet, and I don't know how many times I've said &quot;The only way I'll come back is if they revert a ton of what they did in Cataclysm.&quot; They won't, so I won't be coming back. I log in when they give me a free week to see the state of things, do some randoms, and log out. I keep HOPING that Blizzard turns WoW around and makes it back into the game that I loved and stayed with for six years, but I very seriously doubt it at this point.</div></div><hr />

Yep, it's gone, gone for good. There's no way it's going back to the golden days. I played the game for around 5-6 years, which is only 2nd to counterstrike, and I'm actually very sad that they ruined my favorite game in chase of the almighty dollar. Blizzard themselves are a shadow, an empty vessel of what they once were. The encounters are watered down, content is recycled like crazy, art is recycled and the new art is Grade C at best. PVP has become an utter mess. Classes have zero identity now, which is the biggest strike against the game. It's gone, Blizzard's gone. I still like to follow to see if somehow, some way they get back their wits, but it hasn't happened and likely won't. SC2 was a let down, and a cash in, I'm worried that Diablo 3 is going to be the same or even worse. And I have zero faith in &quot;Titan&quot;. It just sucks. At least I still can remember the old times with all my friends. We still talk about it.</div></div><hr />

Sooo him saying that he has no faith in Blizzards ability with this &quot;Titan&quot; and that it suck to him means he is on Ritalin? I'm not...making the connection here. Good job at ignoring everything else he said, though!</div></div><hr />

And this one reeks &quot;I have no come back&quot;<br />
Why play a game that needs you to have time if you don't have it, that's why the game is as it is and why people are leaving, instead of being a big adventure with friend, battles and all, it became a &quot;go to the city and sit around all day&quot; because of players like you that demanded Blizz to change their game and how the planned it originally.</div></div><hr />

No, just unlike you, I'm free from my bonds of mommy blizzard, and thus I see everything clearly now, and more objectively. Their track record has plummeted. WoW is like predicted, failing as it's going down the path the set it to. SC2 is stale, and a rip off that you have to buy the 2 expansions to get what should be a full game out of it, with very-very little added assets. D3 is a roller coaster ride right now. It's not hard to see the trends when you're not in the flock of blind sheeple like yourself, who didn't question blizzard, nor vote with your wallet, which allowed them to destroy the game and put it in the failing state it's suffering through right now while on life support. So thank you for that. So, that said, there's no disputing why someone would be really skeptical of their future software entries.<br />
<br />
Rift has already severely wounded WoW on top what blizzard themselves did, and SWTOR and especially GW2 will crush WoW's last breath.<br />

I'm not surprised here one bit. They're not very talented when it comes to visuals. None of their games are graphically impressive, especially for this day and age. D3 looks almost last gen.</div></div><hr />
