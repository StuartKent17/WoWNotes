But really dude, this is first time US really accomplish something big in Ulduar !!!!-&gt;IMO&lt;-!!! (Please notice -&gt; IMO!!11!)<br />
Im sure you have been waiting for a LONG time to throw such a shitty comment.. Actually, you had to wait untill US got a world first.. lol!<br />

Dude, you SUCK - and so does everyone else, claiming US is the best now that they had a world first etc!!!<br />
US are doing great aswell, but the easiest would be, that they are slacking compared to others..<br />

When making statements like &quot;things are impossible&quot; you judge based on &quot;ideal conditions&quot;. No lag, ideal reaction, best gear, all buffs.

No, the fight has not been nerfed in any way, shape, or form (other than what has already been posted by blues). Phase 3 is still incredibly insane--perhaps too insane. We were INCREDIBLY lucky on the kill attempt. No random bugs involved--just a combination of incredible execution and luck granted by the gods.<br />

Phase 3 is still, in this humble bear's personal opinion, grossly overtuned. I very, very, VERY highly doubt we will repeat it.<br />

To me this still seems like an near impossible encounter where you have to have perfect play and more than perfect luck.When he says he highly doubts that they will repeat it something is wrong with the encounter, but for you math haters i guess your partly correct when people say the encounter is mathematically impossible , Its not,just extremely unlikely as exodus have shown.( ps! if someone have a link to the math , it would be interesting to take a look at :P )</div></div><hr />

that way the question &quot;why is it not about the country?&quot; makes very much sense<br />

2. Encounter bugged out<br />
3. They exploited some crap<br />

<br />
You meet the symbol that has a name:<br />
Vinculum (symbol)<br />
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia<br />
Jump to: navigation, search<br />
A vinculum is a horizontal line placed over a mathematical expression, used to indicate that it is to be considered a group. Vinculum is Latin for &quot;bond&quot;, &quot;fetter&quot;, &quot;chain&quot;, or &quot;tie&quot;, which is roughly suggestive of some of the uses of the symbol.<br />
<br />
Examples of its use include the case of a group of infinitely repeating decimal digits, for example,<br />
<br />
\frac{1}{3} = 0.333333\dots = 0.\overline{3}. <br />
Bah the symbol didn't paste right and I'm not digging through alt codes it appears as a - over the decimal that is repeating. Just because your calculator says things doesn't mean it's true.<br />
<br />
i.e. 2/3 does not = 0.6667 it equals 0.666 repeating</div></div><hr />

Again you have to round to make that equation possible it is not that 1 - 0.99999 repeating is equal to 0 it's that 1 - an infinite number is an impossible equation so rounding must occur. It makes so little difference in reality that noone would question that answer; however, the theoretical answer doesn't exist.</div></div><hr />

Dude, beginning from times of Dude Newton, people have learned, that sum of infinite number of somethings, can be a finit number. This is a much harder concept (greeks had doubts about it, namly this dude: &#918;&#942;&#957;&#969;&#957; &#8001; &#7960;&#955;&#949;&#940;&#964;&#951;&#962;) than this 0.999 thingy.<br />
<br />
Theoretical answer exists: 1 minus 0.999 repeating equals 0.<br />
<br />
And I wonder, what do you think, 0.6666 repeating equals 2/3 or not? :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
That was the easy way to explain it, if you prefer a real proof where you won't be able to point anything like this, look the Infinite series and sequences proof (unless you point out that the basics of all mathematics are wrong, of course), you can find it here (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/0.999...#Analytic).<br />
<br />
No rounding anywhere there, 1 - an infinite number is not an impossible equation, or do you really think (1/3) * 3 is also impossible ?, since 1/3 is infinite ?</div></div><hr />

AKA .99999r = close enough to 1<br />
<br />
Theoretically there is a difference between those two numbers, in reality there is no use in such a distinction. And with that i have work today I must go to bed.<br />
<br />
As a final thought. Number systems that bear out some of these intuitions can be constructed, but only outside the standard real number system used in elementary, and most higher, mathematics. Indeed, some settings contain numbers that are &quot;just shy&quot; of 1; these are generally unrelated to 0.999…, but they are of considerable interest in mathematical analysis.</div></div><hr />

First of all : Congratulations to Exodus.<br />
<br />
Second : EJ used Mathematics to prove A cannot happen. But A happend. The concept of mathematics leaves 2 conclusions : <br />
<br />
Their prove is wrong.<br />
Their model is wrong.<br />
<br />
I think the latter is true, since they merely observe WoW and base their models on observations (I don't believe they have contact to blizzard for exact calculations). Also the complexity of 25 players playing the game is hardly possible to be modeled by just formulas. You can check if your damage is sufficient by just computing, you cannot model the players behaviour perfectly. And thats why their models can only be approximations.<br />
<br />
Third : 0.999 ~ = 1, that can be proven by using the geometric series. This result can be seen in other number system too. For binary numbers we have 0.11111 ~ = 1. Everything you need to see this is an exact definition of the limit. And the limit is not something A tending to something B. It is far more exact, because something can tend in very different ways to something ;)<br />
<br />

fifth : GZ again, i shit on EU vs US<br />

Dude, there is no theory like that, unless you create a new one.<br />
0,6666 infinitellly repeating and 2/3 are just two different ways to WRITE DOWN exact numbers.<br />

It is a definition of how to write down decimal numbers. (in this system, there are 2 ways to write it down, 1 and 0.999~) It doesn't stop anyone from &quot;proving&quot; that those numbers are the same as written this way: 2/3.<br />

In reference to the guy saying that the EU is a country, it isnt. The European Union is a CONTINENT. The US is a country. Soviet Union was a country. The EU is a bunch of countries that made themselves into a union similar to that of the US, but they are all still their own countries for now (each has sovereignty over their own country with their own laws and rulers)..<br />
<br />
As for .999~ = 1 it is true. Outside of the fact that it is not written the same way, prove to me that it is not true.<br />
<br />
EDIT: And for the final topic of EJ math being wrong. They were not wrong. WoW is not an exact model, if you have great luck and slightly more buffs it can throw the math off. EJ never posts margins of error or considers them, so you have to take it with a grain of salt.<br />

For example: A feral druid has a proposed maximum DPS of 7,500. If he is lucky, he can exceed this value. If he is unlucky, he will be below this number even if he executes perfectly.</div></div><hr />

Third: what is this crap about EJ?<br />
- About the 0+ achivment, the explanation is simple, EJ math takes into account average dps/ damage taken and so on. So it simply demo that you can't &quot;ALWAYS&quot; do it. You obviosly can do it if your dps does extra crits, your tanks dodge 10 hit in a row and so on. Exodus itself said that they were lucky and it's very impossible that they repeat it. In a game like wow the variance is pretty high and a good probability tail can make your day. As for feral druid finishers wich was the problem?<br />

It would be 0.0..01 where there are an infinite number of 0's between the decimal point and the 1.

No. The definition of limit theory means that eventually, any neighborhood of the limit contains all the terms of the sequence, but a finite number of them. <br />
<br />
&quot;all the elements of the sequences get as close as we want to the limit&quot; has no meaning, a real number (or point in a topological space) doesn't &quot;get close&quot; to another : they are at a fixed distance one to each other. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
AKA .99999r = close enough to 1<br />
Non. 0.9999r is the limit of the converging infinite sum \sum_{i=1}^\infty (9/10)^i.<br />
<br />
If you prefer, it is the limit of the converging sequence x_n, where x_n = \sum_{i=n}^\infty (9/10)^i.<br />
<br />
Basic computation shows that this limit equals one, hence 0.999r = 1. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm all in favor of believing that the difference between 1 and 0.9r is so small that it can be said not to exist, thus making them the same number. <br />
It is so small that it exactly is zero. <br />
<br />
<br />
I do disagree with how another number which only exists by virtue of notation (the square root of -1) the number &quot;i&quot;. This is an 'imaginary' number, and it has quite an extensive branch of maths built around it, despite it not being a real number.<br />
OK, first &quot;the square root of -1&quot; doesn't exist a priori, and introducing the complex numbers isn't a question of notations. You can take the plan R^2 with its real-vector space structure, say that you want to denote 1 = (1,0), i = (0,1) (hence all its elements can be written a + ib), add a multiplication on it with some complicated formula and check that you obtain a field, which contains an isomorphic copy of the real number via the embedding x -&gt; x + 0 i.<br />
<br />
You also can take the quotient of the ring R[t] by the maximal ideal generated by the polynomial x^2 + 1, but this is rather complicated.<br />
<br />
In the field you have constructed, then there will be two elements whose square coincide with &quot;-1&quot;. (Not only one, hence you cannot speak of &quot;the square root of -1&quot;). <br />
<br />
In all this, you have constructed something coherent, not just given a sense to some strange notation.<br />
<br />
<br />
Who's to say someone cannot define another imaginary number that is defined as that which seperates 1 and 0.9r? Some people say that others have trouble comprehending infinitely large numbers, or an infinitly long sequence; what is wrong with an infinitly small, but still existing number?<br />
Infinite numbers do not exist in the sense you think they exist. Add infinite and minus infinite to the real numbers, you obtain a usual closed segment, juste the size has changed a little bit (it now is compact). Add only one, considerating -\infty and +\infty as being equal one to each other, you obtain... a circle. <br />
<br />
Besides, you're changing the question. It is not &quot;is 0.9999r = 1&quot; anymore, but &quot;is there a way to leave real numbers and complex numbers for a set where we could say that 0.999r is not equal to one ?&quot;. <br />
<br />
There also seems to be a confusion between &quot;infinite number&quot; and &quot;number having an infinite number of decimals&quot;. The number 1/3 is nothing but finite, yet it has an infinite number of decimals.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is a huge difference. Mathematical constructs do not have to have a real world meaning. But they have to be consistent to mathematics itself. The number i is just defined that it square equals minus 1. And it is perfectly consistent with everything around it. We only call it imaginary, in fact it is just a number in a different number field (the field of complex numbers).<br />
<br />
<br />
what is wrong with an infinitly small, but still existing number? <br />

You can define such a thing. But what its for? How it helps mathematics? Do we get a consistent number field with it? Or less?</div></div><hr />

The only boundary in there is people believing there can be something at the end of infinity. But talking about wether there is a 1 somewhere or not is useless, if you really want to prove anything like this you'll just need to prove that the different proofs there are (there must be at least 20 different ways to prove this, mathematical or not) are all wrong.<br />

THAT IS MY CRAZY WAY OF THINKING AND I CAN BE WRONG<br />
and im not ej fanboy or something :P<br />
i didnt saw ej math but i think that:<br />
ej math wasnt for best bosible try but best of most posible <br />
math is logical way to show us this fight but there is illogicial thing called luck that you cant show as a math <br />
lets explain it that way <br />
attack a = 500 dmg<br />
attack b = 1500 dmg<br />
crit% = 40<br />
crit bonus dmg = 100%<br />
you do 100x attack a and 100x attack b <br />
in best of most posible way you will have <br />
40% crits of attack a = 70000 dmg<br />
and <br />
40% crits of attack b = 210000 dmg<br />
a+b=280000 dmg<br />
but there can be also less posible but still not imposible best posible sittuation when you have<br />
0% crit of attack a = 50000 dmg<br />
and <br />
80% crits of attack b = 270000 dmg<br />
a+b=320000 dmg<br />
so ej math dont have to be wrong but saing that something is imposible was wrong <br />
and ya middsumer buffs also should change math :P</div></div><hr />

You are correct afaik , impossible is a wrong statement as long as you use a medium value on RNG values. very very very very unlikely is maybe a better term for it.<br />
however this is not repeatable unless you add alot more &quot;very's&quot; , so boss is extremely luck based ( ofc perfect play to ,but thats a given )</div></div><hr />

<br />
FAIL!<br />
<br />
Let me qute wiki: <br />
<br />
<br />
When asked about 0.999…, novices often believe there should be a &quot;final 9,&quot; believing 1 &#8722; 0.999… to be a positive number which they write as &quot;0.000…1&quot;. Whether or not that makes sense, the intuitive goal is clear: adding a 1 to the last 9 in 0.999… would carry all the 9s into 0s and leave a 1 in the ones place. Among other reasons, this idea fails because there is no &quot;last 9&quot; in 0.999…<br />
<br />
Nor is there any last number as 0! Infinite means infinite!</div></div><hr />

This is right. And for any number of the form 0.9999...9 where the 9s eventually stop, there are (infinitely many) numbers between it and 1.<br />
<br />
But 0.9999r (where the 9 do not eventually stop) is greater than any number of the form 0.99...9, for obvious reasons.<br />
<br />
<br />
Even though someone said that it is close enough and counts as 1, I'd say that if you want to write 1 you write 1 and not 0,999999r, no? :)<br />

<br />
I am not positive whether this was initially posted here or on their site, but I have seen it both here and on the Ensidia boards.<br />
<br />
<br />
I suppose this has been asked in thread after thread, so I'll just stick it in this one:<br />
<br />
No, the fight has not been nerfed in any way, shape, or form (other than what has already been posted by blues). Phase 3 is still incredibly insane--perhaps too insane. We were INCREDIBLY lucky on the kill attempt. No random bugs involved--just a combination of incredible execution and luck granted by the gods.<br />
<br />
Phase 3 is still, in this humble bear's personal opinion, grossly overtuned. I very, very, VERY highly doubt we will repeat it. <br />
<br />
If the fight was nerfed, they didn't realize it and attempt to &quot;abuse&quot; their exclusive knowledge to get a world first. They admit that it was, at least in part, a lucky kill and doubt they could easily repeat it...but they still happened to get lucky first. Even if it was nerfed, that is no fault of Exodus.<br />
<br />
If it comes out that they knowingly abused some mechanic...then that is another case entirely, but they have not been as silent on the matter as you seem to think. Getting any word out in the massive flood of grats and ZOMG THEY MUST HAVE CHEATED is nearly impossible anyway.</div></div><hr />

By your statement.<br />
0.99999... = 1<br />
for ease I will only use 3 decimals. So:<br />
0.999 = 1<br />
This is wrong, because I need .001 for that statement to be true.<br />
<br />
If I go back up again to infinite decimals, the claim that:<br />
0.99999.... = 1<br />
Would still be wrong because I would still be missing something, however small, for that statement to be true.<br />
so, to sum up. 0.99999... will never be the same as 1 because it is, even though infinitely close, still missing something to be the same.<br />
<br />
One could say 0.9999... should be taken as 1 because the missing amount is so small. But that would be an interpretation of an outcome rather than the truth.</div></div><hr />

0.99999... = 1<br />
for ease I will only use 3 decimals. So:<br />
0.999 = 1<br />
This is wrong, because I need .001 for that statement to be true.<br />
<br />
If I go back up again to infinite decimals, the claim that:<br />
0.99999.... = 1<br />
Would still be wrong because I would still be missing something, however small, for that statement to be true.<br />
No. You don't understand. <br />
<br />
Between 0.999 and 1, there is something missing. Between 0.999....9 and 1 as well (something smaller). That missing thing gets smaller and smaller, closer to 0 as you add 9s. With an infinite number of 9s, it is 0.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Geez, shut up with math.. decimals are there for a reason, to show its not 1.<br />
<br />
Waaaaah, a great specialist brings us light with so many detailed arguments, such as &quot;decimals are here to show it's not 1&quot;. <br />
<br />
Indeed : shut up with maths, Mr. Ignorant. 0.999r = 1, and there is a proof for this, which I have posted above. Prove that this proof is wrong, or stop posting non-arguments. R/Z, this thing is a circle, why is it written differently then ? To show that it is different ?</div></div><hr />

I do not know the exact number of threads i've participated in with that topic. I've come to the conclusion that trying to elaborate on every of these false arguments is just a waste of time. Everybody in the first semester of mathematics at university that does not fail, will emediatly see that 0.999~ equals 1. Nobody here can really give a prove why that is not the case. Only humble trys to explain why this cannot be the case, but no single prove. But, as everybody knows, the prove is the only thing that counts in mathematics. There is no such thing as authority or interpretion. There is just the plain prove. But try to teach this somebody that really has no sense for that...</div></div><hr />

<br />
You are correct. However...<br />
<br />
0.9999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999 != 0.9r<br />
<br />
and 0.9r = 1<br />
<br />
Is it logical...not in the common sense of the word no. It is mathematically sound, however.</div></div><hr />

2) I was afraid a 310 speed mount was going to be a rare drop off Mimiron. But, now it's very well earned. Gratz to Exodus, for proving that Americans are only sometimes terrible. :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
if 0.9r was = 1, why wouldn't you just say 1?<br />
Because it is infinitely close to 1 without being 1.<br />
But because it is infinitely close to 1, you interpretate it as 1 for various reasons.<br />
Which was my point with previous post.</div></div><hr />
