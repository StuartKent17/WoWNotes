Even buying it during this month nets Blizz a revenue stream. They take your money and donate it -- thus giving them all the donation tax benefits :P (like when McDonalds donates the change you donated ... you aren't getting credit for that donation!)<br />

BUT still cool that they do it because they could just not do that and people would still buy it.</div></div><hr />

It would be spectacularly illegal for them to lie about the profits going to charity. You may want to loosen your tinfoil hat, it's clearly cutting off the bloodflow to whatever remains of your brain.</div></div><hr />

The only tax benefit Blizzard would receive would be to offset the revenue from selling the pet. If they sell $10,000,000 worth of pets and donate $10,000,000 to charity then the net effect on their bottom line is 0.<br />

Make a wish was never about &quot;saving dying children&quot;. These kids have terminal illnesses with no known cures and have very little time left on this earth. Make a wish wants to allow them to live out their dreams and wildest fantasies. Your whole argument is essentially &quot;Why are you depressed?

<br />
There's a legitimate consideration as to whether you want your charity to help someone find enjoyment in their final hours, or to try to save lives, but I haven't seen anyone trying to discuss it without being a dick.<br />
<br />
Ultimately, you're arguing between two groups, one of whom is doing wonderful work and the other is doing fantastic work.</div></div><hr />

Just because YOU won't buy them does not mean others will do the same. And no it's not fanboyism it's common sense. You alone do not speak for the entire playerbase.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Here is how you can fight them and keep them from ripping the charity off, donate directly to Make-A-Wish. Oh wait if you did that you wouldn't have anything to whine about.<br />
<br />
So I can side with Blizzard who gives some or I can side with you who gives nothing, tough choice.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Teramelle</div><div class="date">2015-12-02, 09:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not really. The &quot;Make a wish&quot;-company gives first world kids who are sick their final chockolate and creates a TV-Show out of it, while the red cross really saves lives, without show-effect.<br />
<br />
Whilst the Red Cross does do good work, there are also a lot concerns about where exactly money donated to them actually goes - and if it's used for aid at all. See: Haiti, 2010. The Make-A-Wish foundation doesn't have this issue - they make it clear where donated money goes - either through annual reports or anecdotal evidence from individuals that they've helped. So, ya know, one is definitely more trustworthy than the other in terms of genuinely helping people. <br />
<br />
That said... You can't fully compare Make-A-Wish and the Red Cross. You can't. They're dealing with entirely different things. The Red Cross may be more comprehensive in that its help does cover a wider range of people and situations, but that doesn't mean that the work that Make-A-Wish does is, in any way, less important. <br />
<br />
Make-A-Wish lets children who are terminally ill find some joy amidst the shitty hand they've been dealt - it comforts them in a time that is nothing but stress. It also helps survivors of these illnesses find happiness again - they may have lived, but they had their childhood ripped away from them by the disease; they spent years being miserable and in pain and not actually experiencing all the joys they should've been able to. Make-A-Wish intends to condense as much of that joy as possible into one huge, spectacular thing, to show the kids that even though they haven't had a good time so far, the world is full of wonder and potential even still. <br />
<br />
They are both important charities, dealing with very different things. You can't compare and contrast them, or say one is &quot;better&quot; than the other - they both do amazing work in their individual fields.<br />
<br />
Besides, remember Argi? The battle pet? All of its profits went to - oh, that's right - the Red Cross. It was just under $2mill, I believe. Blizzard is hardly ignoring them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Slowly? They've been selling pets and mounts on the store for years now. It's nothing new and not much has changed about it (the store and its range) either. <br />
<br />
Blizz don't have to give any of the profits of anything they sell to charity, but they do and they are. Anyone who is cynical about that is just a grinch. What have you done for charity lately? Donated millions? No? Then STFU. If you think there are more worthy causes out there, then pony up some bucks to it. Blizzard can choose whatever charity they want to support. They can't choose them all.</div></div><hr />

There was one when I did it but there was an error in the process so I should have reworded that. EU here. Dunno for other continents though. Guess the button only appeared briefly and was unintentional.<br />

I think giving money to those who save lives, and in special who dont just give the money to the kids of the rich only, is more valuable than a show-compatible teddy bear for a first world kid with terminal illness.. both are bad, still i think my money should go to where you are able to save hundreds instead of a luxury teddy bear with diamond eyes for a kid thats already living in the first world..<br />

1- They said right after they were aware of the issue with gifting.<br />
2- Neither do you since you are just outright spewing idiotic statements. Advertising anything that involves the proceeds going to charity and then not donating the proceeds is theft/deceptive trade and is highly illegal.<br />
3- I work at a local supermarket but tbh just for the money I'd happily take a job with em and sell my soul while I'm at it. Money is money at the end of the day.</div></div><hr />

Show me where I said they are lying about giving the money to charity. Go ahead, quote it. I said it was false advertising cause it says it can be gifted when in fact it could not be and people were spending money thinking they could and watched as they threw away money. Read posts from now on, maybe Blizzard will give you a raise if you do.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rixis</div><div class="date">2015-12-04, 06:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As with all Blizzard Store items that can be gifted, the gift option is on the store web page as a separate entry. That this option may not have been available for a few hours is unfortunate, but they never stated the pet could be traded in game. The only time this has been the case was the Winged Guardian Cub, and a load of fuss was made about it.<br />
<br />
I imagine that those who &quot;wasted&quot; money could contact Blizzard for a refund, or should check more thoroughly next time.</div></div><hr />

The people that bought it and didn't realize there wasn't a gift option but still bought it thinking they could trade it are probably kids with their moms CC. Either way you could probably put a ticket in for it. And Blizzard realized a few minutes after it went live that the gift option did not. They didn't falsify anything as a bug is a bug. It happens.</div></div><hr />

No, I think he's just using his head; ripping off charity would be an incredibly stupid move to make, would it not? Naivety has nothing to do with it, its people who are so blinkered by the notion that blizzard are...I dunno, evil? (I mean who the fuck else rips off charity) that they would assume Blizzard are lying about donating the money to charity.<br />
<br />
If Make a Wish never got the money, they would A: Say so, and B: Sue the company. Especially in America. I mean do you honestly think Blizzard would actually publicly rip off a charity? With hand on heart do you believe that? All it would take is Make a Wish saying they never got the money, and that's it, game over for Blizzard, for now and ever more so. They'd never recover from a scandal like that.<br />

<br />
Mmm yes, some people called him a shill so it must be true. People get called shills here a lot as a penniless mans counter argument. Given your logic, I could easily call you a shill for another MMO seeing as you really...don't seem to like the game or Blizzard. But it would be daft, you don't /have/ to like the game, though I do question why you hang around.<br />
<br />
How can you be so self centered to believe that the only way people could not have the same opinion as Shudder, is if they're being paid? I don't agree with what you say perhaps 95% of the time, but I don't deny that you have those opinions in the first place.I mean, do you honestly believe those people are shills, or is it something you're saying in an attempt to discredit them? Although you do tend to abuse people on here quite a lot and behave like noone is as clever or clued in as you, so perhaps you are that self centered. I also question why you believe its okay to behave like that if you've spent any time on the planet. You're not going to get through to people if you abuse them.<br />
<br />
I get called a shill by anti vaccers all the time, much the same way people call other people shills here for defending something. Trust me, I most certainly am not getting kick backs from big pharma.</div></div><hr />
