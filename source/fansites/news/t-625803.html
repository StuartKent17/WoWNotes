MMO-Champion - Now Recruiting!<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/november/MMO-Champ-Logo-207px.pngMMO-Champion is recruiting again! The first phase of recruitment wasn't as successful as expected, mostly because the timing was pretty bad (asking people to work on WotLK content right after the end of the alpha probably wasn't the best idea). We're looking for the following people:<br />
<br />
Moderators<br />
Most of the time the forums are a warzone, and we definitely need a lot more moderators. There are just a few requirements if you want to apply:<br />
<br />
Decent English writing skills<br />
Your forum account must be older than one month. <br />
Preferably, a post count above 50 would be nice. (Mostly to check your personality on forums, having 1000+ posts won't help) <br />
Don't be stupid.<br />
<br />
And that's it, depending on the amount of answers I get I might add a few requirements but I don't want to scare anyone for the moment. <br />
<br />
<br />
News writers<br />
This one is a bit complicated, technically I'm just looking for people to bring additional content to the site, but I wouldn't mind having a few people as a backup just in case. Let's say that if you're very good (previous experience on a WoW News site would be a great thing) we're also interested in regular front page newsers. (Including the easy blue posts!) <br />
<br />
We're not interested in blog-like posts, there are tons of WoW blogs and the objective isn't to compete with them. <br />
No, you can't apply just to list blue posts once a day and pretend that you're working hard. I already do that. <br />
Having a decent experience in datamining/MPQ Browsing/etc... will help.<br />
I'm also looking for people willing to write articles on interesting videos, addons, and all that kind of &quot;side-news&quot;. <br />
<br />
I can't really go further into details because your job is also to find interesting stuff by yourself. Basically, if you think you can contribute regularly to the front page, we need you!<br />
<br />
<br />
Content updaters<br />
This one is easy to explain, your job is to work update and create the pages any dungeon, items, factions pages after each content patch (as of today, it also includes all the outdated WotLK pages I still have on the site). You will need:<br />
<br />
Basic understanding of HTML is necessary, that's something you can learn very easily and it won't take long to have someone explain it to you.<br />
Basic understanding of SVN (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subversion_(software)) (Again, that's something we can explain in less than 10 lines) <br />
Decent English writing skills, autonomy, etc ...<br />
<br />
There aren't many requirements I can add here, again if you think you can contribute to the site just apply. (Obviously, a sample of your work will be necessary)<br />
<br />
<br />
How to apply<br />
That's easy, send a mail to <br />
mmoc.recruit@gmail.com with: <br />
<br />
A few RL information about you, nothing too detailed. <br />
The position you're applying for in the subject of the mail, please also include your nickname (Like &quot;[Content updater] - AwesomeDwarf&quot;)<br />
A sample of your work, update something on the site, write an article, anything else ... You're going to start working on it sooner or later, better start with your application to avoid wasting time. (Of course it doesn't apply to forum moderators)<br />
<br />
Only the sample of your work is important here, I got hundred of answers for the first recruitment phase and sending non-WoW related articles just doesn't work. <br />
<br />

Dark Legacy Comic #168<br />
Today news is mostly focusing on the recruitment but just like every monday, a new Dark Legacy Comic (http://www.darklegacycomics.com/168.html) is out. <br />

<br />
<br />
Uh, on the mounts page, it might help if the twilight drake is flagged as only dropping when Sartharion is taken Down with 3 drakes up, not merely when hes defeated on Heroic mode. Or is that what Hard Mode connotates?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">azrielen</div><div class="date">2008-12-08, 01:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Uh, on the mounts page, it might help if the twilight drake is flagged as only dropping when Sartharion is taken Down with 3 drakes up, not merely when hes defeated on Heroic mode.

<br />
<br />
That's what Hard Mode stands for, as opposed to Heroic. But it could be clearer, yeah.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bananas</div><div class="date">2008-12-08, 02:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">the Blake Drake is what you get for doing the normal (10man) version of Satharion in hard mode (with the 3 adds still up). There is a distinct difference between Heroic and Hard mode.<br />
<br />
Its been said that completeing Satharion in normal hard mode is the toughest fight of the expansion, due to trying to keep the 3 adds up while downing Sath with a total of only 10 people.<br />
<br />
<br />
Do the recruits get paid in lasagna?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh yeah I apply for the role of forum troll by the way! Naaaah kidding :P</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Boubouille</div><div class="date">2008-12-08, 03:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm guessing the SVN you work with is for the site content, guides, etc?<br />
<br />
<br />
Yeah, I don't want 50 people running around with html editing rights on MMO-Champion. (I actually care about security! sometimes.)<br />
<br />
Also, just to make it clear because a few people asked, this isn't a paid position. Technically, it could be paid in the end because if you're useful there isn't any reason to not pay you, but don't expect to be paid to update 2 pages. <br />
<br />
Oh and it seems that the blue tracker crashed during the week end, it might explain the lack of blue posts. ^^</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mascotte</div><div class="date">2008-12-08, 05:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm interesting.<br />
What is your definition of a forum moderator Bou?<br />
Would this include an overall selection of moderating/awnsering questions/deleting spam-keyloggers etc or would it just be an advanced function to report any (miss) abuse to a &quot;higher&quot; ranked member for him/her to check out?</div></div><hr />

Paid? What is this 'paid' of which you speak?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NiveouS</div><div class="date">2008-12-08, 05:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey Boubouille, little confusing requirements...<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Every requirement you mention says that they can be easily taught... with in no time when explained. But then you ask for a sample of ones work, which is only possible if you already possess the skills and knowledge of HTML and SVN. So, which is it, do you need just basic knowledge of HTML, then learn SVN. Or, no knowledge at all, or good knowledge of everything.<br />
<br />
Cheers ;)</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LavaDuck</div><div class="date">2008-12-08, 05:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So, response time for applicants is 1-2 weeks? And if you haven't heard anything after those 2 weeks you didn't get through?<br />
<br />
Just wondering :&gt;</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Latka</div><div class="date">2008-12-08, 09:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Can I suggest that you don't list &quot;Decent English skills?&quot; I'd rather read an article that was written by someone with excellent skills. Nothing is more irritating than reading a poorly written article.<br />
<br />
Love the website - hope you can land someone good!</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Name0</div><div class="date">2008-12-08, 09:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would like this job :O)</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LavaDuck</div><div class="date">2008-12-08, 10:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;This&quot; doesn't really say alot as there are 3 jobs you can apply to</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">exceptionthrown</div><div class="date">2008-12-08, 11:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It looks like the majority (all?) of the site is done in PHP. Is your content engine fairly robust/stable in that someone who applies for a content uploading position will only be required to know HTML and pass that in? I guess what I'm asking is if something internal breaks, are the content uploaders going to be expected to help fix it?<br />
<br />
That being said, do you have any plans to bring on more software developers to help create additional functionality on the website?<br />
<br />
Finally, you mentioned it's possible one of these positions could lead to a paid job. Can you give any indication on what kind of pay people who meet the qualifications you outlined would be getting if you decided to bring them on-board as a paid employee?</div></div><hr />
