If they already know the name of the expansion for sure, better to prepare the forum in advance than having to deal with the insane flood of posts when the name is &quot;unveiled&quot; at Blizzcon.</div></div><hr />

If they kept the WoD discussions to a limited number of threads, this wouldn't be needed. Every fake &quot;leak&quot; thread doesn't need to stay open for 15 pages.</div></div><hr />

I'd bet money on WoD being the expansion, but even if Blizz pulls something completely out of left field tomorrow, changing a display string isn't exactly the hardest thing to do. I'm sure whomever handles the forums could just as easily have it say &quot;WoW Expansion 5&quot; or &quot;Corgis Unleashed&quot; within a minute of the official announcement tomorrow.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Warlords of Draenor - SC2 - Protoss expansion?<br />
<br />
I can't tell if you're serious or not... Assuming you're serious... Draenor is very much a Warcraft thing, the universes of Warcraft and Starcraft are not the same universe. If one believes Warlords of Draenor to be an official Blizzard trademark, then that really only leaves WoW or a Warcraft RTS. It's not Diablo, it's not Starcraft, it's not Hearthstone or the MOBA.<br />
<br />
<br />
Warlords of Draenor. It's..well vague. Not much to tell about that.<br />
<br />
So it's vague in your opinion, it's not that it &quot;doesn't add up&quot;. There's a difference.<br />
<br />
<br />
Seems a bit eager/pre-emptive to make a separate forum dedicated to something that may well not be the next expansion at all. Time will tell tomorrow.<br />
<br />
If they announce another name for the expansion, I'm sure they can easily have this forum's name updated within a minute.</div></div><hr />

Correct, they're not mutually exclusive, however something being vague to you is not providing the requested example of whatever doesn't add up and is leaving you with doubts about WoD being the WoW expansion.</div></div><hr />

Saying this isn't proof isn't ignorance. Until Blizzard announces it, or Bibi leaks something, nothing is proven. That said, I don't like the sound of WoD or the potential avenues it could go, but it's there and we'll see what they're going to do with it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's a title. You have zero information on the expansion and regardless of what everyone thinks, no one knows anything. This is by far the best kept expansion or project that Blizzard has worked on. Those are the only 2 things we have to go off of. This expansion could be something TOTALLY different than the speculation here on MMOC.</div></div><hr />

Oh yay, it's completely irrelevant comparisons time!</div></div><hr />

It sucks that he has to keep his integrity up with Blizzard, but he wouldn't get the information he gets if he did continue to leak it.<br />
<br />
Then what would be the point in getting the information in the first place. So he only knows what others want to know? I mean I'm not arguing with you I just think if you are/were a leaker then you should leak information lol. I'm sure they have some special deal with Blizz where they are allowed to reveal the news before other websites.</div></div><hr />

Not remotely comparable. You need to try again.<br />

Blizz has gone full on corporate, max profits mode over the years<br />

They have consolidated a place for all the wild bullshit about WoD to go, instead of clogging and spamming the other forums. Whether or not this is legitimately the expansion makes no never mind.<br />
<br />
It also means that instead of having to search out and find all of these nonsensical threads and closing/deleting them in the case that this is NOT the next expansion, they have all of them under one section and can just mass delete them all.</div></div><hr />

So i'm guessing it's a real trademark obviously now, but no idea what game it's an addition too, could still be hearthstone or it could be wow. In less then 24 hours we will know anything so :D<br />

<br />
Some people are so far gone that I'm afraid even an official announcement at Blizzcon wouldn't be enough to shatter their confounding resolve.<br />
<br />
The problem is simply that most people could not figure out why all the false trademark stuff from this summer was fake... and the difference between all those false ones, and these new round of real ones. All they see is ´ok, this is just one more in a long line of trademark rumors´.<br />
<br />
Many of us knew they were faked ones before (hint, the * next to the form fields), and know these new ones are real.<br />
<br />
WoD is the expansion.<br />

I'm a little bit confused about Warlords of Draenor's authenticity. Isn't anyone the least bit suspicious about it? Everyone is throwing all their eggs into the Warlords basket but they aren't thinking. Blizzard is notorious for trying to hide the names of expansions and other future content. Did anyone forget that they straight up denied Mists of Pandaria was the next expansion? Or when Worgens and Goblins were going to be the new race and the masks were leaked, they did their best to hide that too. Now, The Dark Below was trademarked a few months ago and then Corgis Unleashed soon afterwards. Because of Corgis, everyone screams fake but I would take a closer look.<br />
Typically, Blizzard trademarks games a few months prior to Blizzcon, just as they did with The Dark Below. Now, trademarking a name just a week prior to Blizzcon across different countries on a variety of days? This is all too fishy for me. Of course, tomorrow we will know the truth, but until then, I think the next expansion is The Dark Below. I may be wrong, but my instincts tell me otherwise.<br />
<br />
This is what is wrong with people. The Dark Below and Corgis were both obvious fakes because what we saw was an incomplete form. Someone started filling in the form, took a screenshot, and then cancelled the form. It was never submitted. It is why there were *s all over the place.<br />
<br />
WoD is an actual trademark ( multiple countries) and are completed applications that were filed and payed for by Blizzard<br />
<br />
Of course Blizzard tries to hide stuff, if they released all the information in the last few months, it would make Blizzcon less meaningful. Also, they never denied anything like you said... they just used some misdirection until the moment they wanted to announce it. And as far as I am aware, they never commented on WoD either.<br />
<br />
The MUST do the trademarking and buy the domain name before Blizzcon and the official announcement or else someone could squat on the domain name for months. Even though Blizzard would win in the end, it would mean they wouldn´t have control of the domain name when it is announced at Blizzcon.<br />
<br />
it is the same reason they added ´mobile´ devices to the trademark. They do not want anyone else creating an app and calling it ´WoD´. Blizzard may not want to make anything mobile about it, but they have to protect their IP on all devices.<br />
<br />

It's confirmed. Boub said, &quot;but let's just say that on a personal level I'm pretty confident about this one&quot;. So that means an employee told her it's the name, but she can't prove it unless she outs that friend and causes them to lose their job.<br />
<br />
No, it is because anyone with half a brain can verify the trademarks.<br />

the reason he would want information, and yet not release it yet?<br />
<br />
um.. lol<br />
<br />
Wait until tomorrow evening when a ton of pages, graphics, sub-sections to this site, lists etc etc all magically appear. You think, right now, MMO-Champion doesn´t have a crapload of work already done to spring on us the moment it is made official at Blizzcon. Or do you think they are only going to start working on the WoD section of this website next week?</div></div><hr />
