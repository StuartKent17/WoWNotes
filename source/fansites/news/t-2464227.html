As always, we’ll post here and elsewhere if the above changes, and final adjustments will be in the next hotfixes update after maintenance.<br />

So a nerf to resto druids in pvp?<br />

<br />
A HUGE 1-1.5% buff to unholy, unholy - the lowest DPS spec in game right now, the lowest DPS spec with the worst rampup/targetswap mechanic and worst mobility.<br />
Guess what, with the arms buff, unholy remains the last DPS spec with 20% DC buff.<br />
<br />
It doesnt really matter, since every PvE mechanic demands RANGE / ROGUE for usable DPS. Keeping allready unwanted hybrid-specs subpar on DPS is just overkill for any players who don't enjoy the RANGE / ROGUE meta.<br />
<br />
At this point WorldofWarcraft is allready at Diablo3 level, with forced meta comps and nothing else. It's maybe inconvenient in Diablo3 for players, but in this MMO, with Days/Weeks/Years of playtime for 1 single class, its pure sadism from blizzard to force the players to switch or quit for tunning reasons.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, no? Straight up sims aren't the way to go when looking at how a class is performing.<br />

Not even that far behind people that are middle of the pack and above arcane/arms while receiving a pretty nice buff. No buff will make or break a good player, especially in a raid environment.</div></div><hr />

Because multidotring padding meters on fights are the way mythic bosses die on progression....<br />

you must be really special if you don't get this whole change is around PvE, if you have problems in pvp then it's you that's at fault, not the spec/class as a whole, learn to play better.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Boo Radley</div><div class="date">2019-01-27, 05:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">&gt;People saying &quot;wow is not a pvp game&quot; <br />
<br />
Remember all those mythic dungeon tournaments that were broadcast in 2007? Me neither, but I do remember the pvp tournaments that have been going since arenas started. 11 years of being a pvp game officially. Pvp gear, instances, seasons, ratings, titles. All of that is &quot;Not pvp&quot; to you I guess.<br />
<br />
Just because you're bad at pvp and shy away from it doesnt make those players' concerns less valid. Insane burst getting more insane is actually a bigger deal in arenas than your &quot;My numbers look more insignificant because of someone elses numbers&quot; first world problems. They actually die and lose. You still can clear the encounter, you just arent fawned over by a bunch of fat 40 year old dudes because of your &quot;mad deeps bro.&quot;<br />
<br />
Actually, even funnier is that you have a list of preset mechanics, a cast bar telling you which mechanic is being used, a timer mod telling you when to watch out for the mechanic and you STILL lose to it consistently. I would also feel insecure if a commodore 64 routinely made me cry like an infantile retard as well. <br />
<br />
Lets be honest, I might get infracted/banned but it had to be said.</div></div><hr />
