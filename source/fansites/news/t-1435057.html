Another PvP Season for Mists of Pandaria<br />
It looks like that Season 15 gear (http://www.wowdb.com/items?filter-green-text=22) that was added &quot;just in case&quot; may see some use after all, with another PvP season coming before Warlords of Draenor. <br />

Update: Normal Difficulty Cross-Realm Siege of Orgrimmar<br />

Storage Space Issues<br />
Even bandaid fixes for storage issues (ie more void storage) take time to develop and implement, so we'd prefer to spend that time working on solutions, like systems that hold your items and gear in new ways that don't actually use inventory slots. We announced the account-wide toy and heirloom systems at BlizzCon, as well as the ability to craft from your bank and bigger stack sizes for some items, and we've hinted at some slightly longer term plans for a gear collection/wardrobe feature that would help serve all the transmoggers out there in not just freeing up space but also providing the ability to easily track set collections - all of which will help in their own way with inventory management. While the toy and heirloom systems are planned for the launch of Warlords, the gear collection system will be a bit later. We expect the toy and heirloom systems will free up enough space for most people, as well as some (albeit bandaid-y) slightly larger bags in Warlords and attaching quest items to the quest log instead of as items to fill up your bags, will all help in the meantime.<br />
<br />
Any idea if we will still be able to &quot;use&quot; Dartol's Rod of Transformation or Archmage Vargoth's Staff at will? The first one no longer has a quest associated with it. Will we get to keep it?<br />
<br />
I've trashed most &quot;toy&quot; items, opting for transmog bag space. But I have no intention of getting rid of those 2 items, nor a few other old quest things I have.<br />
We'll be handling each item on a case-by-case basis, and will be looking for everyone's help in identifying items that could/should be added to the toy box beyond the probably more obvious ones we already have flagged. It's largely going to be something solidified through testing and feedback. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/288264-more-void-storage-please/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/11160946369?page=2#38))<br />

Pallytank here.My cotank is a warrior.He spamtaunts adds/bosses/doesnt care for tanking just dps.Superannoying and I can do little to stop him. Doesnt care ATALL for tanking,just pure dps.Will this get addressed?<br />
When both tanks have that mindset, it can be quite fun. However, when they don't, it can be aggravating. The Vengeance change will make that no longer with doing. However, we want to improve cooperative tank gameplay so as not to lose that potential fun. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/417388235313004545))<br />

Warlords of Draenor PvP<br />
Can you talk about WoD BG-s? Are you guys adding new BG for WoD?<br />
WoD release approach is improve existing BG experience and set foundation for faster creation/iteration. Big content is Ashran. (Source (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/416703424454213632))<br />
Really looking forward to seeing objective based rewards and their visibility in the scoreboard/UI<br />
Me too! (Source (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/417152693463834624))<br />
<br />
Have you thought of making the achievement Grievous Combat and future achieves like it account wide once you earn? For gearing alts<br />
no it was to help people gear multiple specs, which won't be necessary with WoD gear changes. You can expect to see that go away. (Source (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/416994192720928768))<br />
<br />
Is the Grievous Combatant mount going away when the next PvP season starts or will it still be obtainable later? Thanks!<br />
It won't be going away. Planning on a similar achievement each season (and hopefully more mounts) (Source (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/416692249624592384))<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
You can also be suspended for wintrading which uses the Enter Battle button. <br />
1. We have to have leave queue but it should be smaller and we should also allow you to accept while in combat. (Source (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/416765229922799617))<br />
2. Playing every game should be made more efficient than tanking 10. &quot;Deserter debuff&quot; may be cleanest option. (Source (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/416765718341111808))<br />
3. Don't believe everything you read on the Internet about suspensions. (Source (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/416765918820458497))<br />
4. There will be no 5. (Source (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/416766200925147136))<br />
Or &quot;Leave queue&quot; doesn't lose mmr for your team or gain MMR for the team you would've fought.<br />
People leaving queues is not good for the game. When you enter a match, there should be an opponent. (Source (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/416769978353065984))<br />
We need to enter arenas when dead. Sound setting so that JUST Q POP audible out of game?<br />
You'll be able to accept queues with the same rule set as LFD with respect to combat (Source (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/417152242894917634))<br />
<br />
can the battlegound achievements be account wide? Eg 100 wins of this bg, or disarm X bombs. Needs to be more alt friendly.<br />
They already are, I believe. can you confirm? (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/417021697116495872))<br />
I don't believe progress is shared across characters but I don't believe that is unique to BG achievements. (Source (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/417033617744097280))<br />
<br />
What do you think about cosmetic arena teams?<br />
Could be fun if the party leader could &quot;name&quot; the temp team. Just isn't a priority right now. (Source (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/416584690641141760))<br />
I miss being able to track comp stats... BTW when can we have arena game history back on armory?<br />
It had a high storage requirement &amp; was 1 of the least used features of the armory. Might explore for trial #nopromises (Source (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/416655384976588800))<br />
<br />
revisiting this. Is it intended that the elite gear requires rating? Not the case last season.<br />
Yes it's intentional. Last season it didn't have rating as original plan was to provide better stats. (Source (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/415181484656693248))<br />
<br />
Professions<br />
I really hate to rush somewhere, to pull something from other players' hands, when somebody pulling stuff from my hands<br />
Competition for profession mats is an interesting situation. On one hand, we want them to feel natural, sometimes scarce. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/417377207598587904))<br />
On the other, we don't want player collision to feel like a negative thing (ideally a positive). Interesting discussion. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/417377567071420416))<br />
<br />
Is there any chance to let people with crafting professions allowed to repair their armor? By making oils, patches etc.<br />
It's been discussed internally on &amp; off since I started during BC, and probably before that. (Source (https://twitter.com/Dave_Maldo/status/417016379179421696))<br />
<br />
Any changes coming to Archaeology? And will we see Archaeology and Garrisons have any interaction?<br />
Current plan is 1. general quality-of-life tweaks (think gathering in MoP) &amp; 2. garrison interaction (we can't go into details yet). (Source (https://twitter.com/Dave_Maldo/status/415267043147927552))<br />
<br />
Future<br />
Will Proving Grounds leaderboards ever happen? It'd be nice to not depend on wowprogress to make use of the score feature.<br />
It's something we're interested in potentially doing, but I don't know when we'll be able to get to it. Would be easy to read it as an indicator of class/spec balance, when it's not intended to be. So, need to be careful. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/416688852481236992))<br />
<br />
Any plans for pets that are tamed to keep special effects like Duskstalkers in jade forest with the shadowform?<br />
Looking into tech that'll put visuals like that on display level and not an aura; not sure when it'll be ready &amp; applied. (Source (https://twitter.com/Dave_Maldo/status/416633880834105346))<br />
<br />
Btw, next year, how about a Greench pet?<br />
Wanted to 1st year but it's too complex! Needs new art. T_T (Source (https://twitter.com/Dave_Maldo/status/416345555040620544))<br />
What's wrong with the existing Greench model? Can't he just be shrunk down to battle pet size?<br />
It's bad for same technical reasons the Personal World Destroyer isn't just a shrunken Fel Reaver. (Source (https://twitter.com/Dave_Maldo/status/416631272861995009))<br />
<br />
Transmogrification<br />
How about the chance of adding daggers, and fist weapons to the one hand, sword/axe/hammer plate?<br />
Same issue(s)! Unlikely for both philosophical &amp; technical reasons (mostly animations). (Source (https://twitter.com/Dave_Maldo/status/416611385787678720))<br />
<br />
I wouldn't say a complete restriction lift, but plate should be able to xmog mail, mail xmog leather, etc. There is an old paladin mail set and hunters would look great in leather.<br />
Sub-40 armor types are for sub-40 characters. TRIVIA: It's item-based, not class-based, so currently impossible anyhow! (Source (https://twitter.com/Dave_Maldo/status/416610007799451650))<br />

Reputation / Questing<br />
Wow often gets accused of being faceroll. It's things like minimum quest levels that force it to be faceroll when it needn't be.<br />
Things like minimum quest levels protect new players who don't know any better, though. What's easy for you is hard for others. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/414541152121917440))<br />

so a 9 month period between final boss and next expansion is not uncommon.<br />
<br />
Patch 5.4.0 was released on September 10, 2013<br />
<br />
if you put these facts together Warlords of Draenor is still an option for somewhere late june- early july. the current arena season can end 2 weeks from now. than a bye week than 20 weeks for the next season. 2 bye weeks before WoD and we are somewhere around july 1st maybe <br />
but i have to admit my gut feeling is they will postpone it till late august. early september</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ofcourse not, it's got that whole blue color to it rather than being green. It's the same thing with mounts where recolors aren't just recolors of other mounts or scaled down versions of mobs. Gotta add the twist in there to make it sound like a meaningful amount of time went into creating these things when in reality all they are is a color swap and scaling it down.<br />
<br />
Also this confirms that for 3 straight expacs.....they have learned literally nothing. If this expac was meant to come out in the first half of the year they would have mentioned a beta for it by now and would be in the process of getting it ready. The new year has started however and not a single word has been said other than &quot;we think it's farther along then previous expacs were at this point&quot;. Well obviously it's not when you have to add back in the previously cancelled 5.5 to give some life into the game you know can't hold retention for anymore. Stop telling people something is far along when in reality you just want to save face so people are given hope that after 6 years of this happening, maybe just maybe you learned something.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's what I'm thinking. Just another season for the sake of another season..? There's ALWAYS been numerous class changes/rebalancing between arena seasons, as they're always implemented at the same time as major content patches. I haven't heard anything of the sort in the works - so it'll be exactly the same as now, just with a higher iLvl? Fun times. Totally excited. Hur hur.</div></div><hr />

It's the same thing with mounts where recolors aren't just recolors of other mounts or scaled down versions of mobs. Gotta add the twist in there to make it sound like a meaningful amount of time went into creating these things when in reality all they are is a color swap and scaling it down.<br />
<br />
Also this confirms that for 3 straight expacs.....they have learned literally nothing. If this expac was meant to come out in the first half of the year they would have mentioned a beta for it by now and would be in the process of getting it ready. The new year has started however and not a single word has been said other than &quot;we think it's farther along then previous expacs were at this point&quot;. Well obviously it's not when you have to add back in the previously cancelled 5.5 to give some life into the game you know can't hold retention for anymore. Stop telling people something is far along when in reality you just want to save face so people are given hope that after 6 years of this happening, maybe just maybe you learned something.<br />
<br />
Why would they change it if you people pay for it anyway? :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
MoP was finally released on September 25, 2012<br />
<br />
so a 9 month period between final boss and next expansion is not uncommon.<br />
<br />
Patch 5.4.0 was released on September 10, 2013<br />
<br />
if you put these facts together Warlords of Draenor is still an option for somewhere late june- early july. the current arena season can end 2 weeks from now. than a bye week than 20 weeks for the next season. 2 bye weeks before WoD and we are somewhere around july 1st maybe <br />
but i have to admit my gut feeling is they will postpone it till late august. early september<br />
<br />
The difference is that we are now stuck with Timeless Isle, LFR/Flex and no new 5 man dungeons plus you gear up very fast. Content is being consumed at a very high pace yet they fail to deliver new content faster while they hired new employees and their team is now much bigger.<br />
<br />
It's a disgrace tbh. If it really is going to take this long for the new expansion to be released they can say goodbye to a lot of subscribers. Have fun with your new character models and minigames (Garrisons/pet battles)...</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baphomette</div><div class="date">2014-01-08, 10:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The reason this is disappointing is because Blizzard was doing so well on the 6mo raid tier schedule during MoP (5.0 Sept, 5.2 Mar, 5.4 Sept). I don't think anyone realistically expected 6.0 to drop in March, but a May/June timeframe wasn't out of the question and now it looks like MoP will last longer than Cata just because they're dragging the last tier out.<br />
<br />
That said, two PVP seasons during one PVE tier is unprecedented so we'll see how it goes.</div></div><hr />

Exactly. <br />
<br />
Instead they rather nerf or maybe even sell us level 90 characters like it will somehow fix the issue of boredom for experienced/good players who are now pulling whole instances to make it somewhat interesting...<br />
<br />
There is way too much &quot;protection&quot; in this game now. It's way too forgiving. <br />
If content is too hard for you then you can always take a step back. If content is too easy and boring for you you just have to deal with that. The hardest leveling content is easy.<br />
No, I am not going to level naked without xp bonuses just because Blizzard can't give us proper leveling content.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm playing since beta and this will be my third time that I will take a break - every time I came back I was exhausted/bored by the new content faster and faster... the carrot to pull me back is getting every time smaller and the flavor is getting old.

Well said.<br />

The small percentage of people that are crying for xrealm are the same ones whinging WoD is taking too long to come out.<br />
<br />
If Blizz start work on that it means it will be more months 90% of the playerbase has to wait to maybe satisfy a few cry babies.<br />

Exactly, Blizzard promising new contents faster and the the raid content since Cata have been shit, SoO is worse then Dragon Soul in my opinion. I HATE SoO its so shit imo.<br />
<br />
MoP isn't gonna last shorter then previous expansions, just as long if not longer if something. With new Season coming, we'll see WoD launch not before September, and that's 2 years since MoP launch which is longer then Cata lasted. And just as long as WotLK lasted.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, I mean I actually *try* not to be skeptical myself on stuff, but Blizzard has gone twice so far overshooting the mark and making stuff drag on way too much, long after it should have been finished. Part of me does agree with Shigeru Miyamoto's saying of 'A late game is late once, a bad game is bad forever' most of the time, but one more expac like this and I'd be willing to add 'Unless you're Blizzard, just put the goddamn game out already.' :p <br />
<br />
If they can make it before Q2 is done(late June), they'll have had SoO for about 9 months...I'll count that as an overwhelming win in their case. (That would put this season at roughly 20 weeks, wrapping up late May and allowing a month in between.) They really need to get off their asses, though. They no longer have the 12.5 million sub padding; it's probably around 7 NOW, and we haven't had the next quarterly report yet(I'd not expect a huge drop, but probably a couple hundred thousand or so). I mean, I like to say that they don't *want* to delay, and I really don't think they want to, but they're just really bad at managing their time(and yeah, that includes planning for possible hiccups in the design.) <br />
<br />
They seem to at least be *somewhat* thinking ahead this time; ditching 5.5, not wanting to take up too much potential dev time with stuff on this expansion(and honestly they should just let Normal Mode cross-server sit until WoD), a lower amount of starting dungeons, not too much in the way of fancy stuff to plug in, delayed raids will give them more time allowing them to launch while still tuning them, and so on. Time will tell if they can actually put it all together, though. Given it's been twice in a row...I just don't know.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The difference between ICC, DS and SoO is that ICC was pug friendly, you could log alts and do 4-6 bosses depending on the raid group, even more if you got into the great groups which downed upto and sometimes including 11 bosses. <br />
<br />
DS was abit less pug friendly then ICC but it was doable with decent group, at least the first bosses, plus running LFR wasn't so tedious like now, doing full SoO is annoying and takes around 4 hours in total, upto 6-8 if you get braindead people, at least DS lfr lasted 30 mins each wing so 1 hour total, 1.5-2 hours at most if you get idiotic groups. You're no way going to pug SoO normal, unless you're joinging some heroic 10/25 man guild doing alt runs and need someone to fill last spot, or top guild making a run you might down something.<br />
<br />
Also you can't even argue &quot;But you has flex!&quot; that's way different and the gear you get there is just slightly better then Timeless(upgraded) items.<br />
<br />
I just wish normal was more pug friendly, that alone would make content even more fun for those who can find something to do with alts.</div></div><hr />

Only reason I was still subbed was b/c I was hoping for a early year release.....If I have to wait post summer then my sub is going. Already barely playing as is...and mostly just logging in to level battle pets..... They really are going to be bleeding subs after this announcement.</div></div><hr />

I feel like it's a lose-lose situation, if it's a pre-summer release it'll be rushed and unfinished and we'll end up with like half of new char models released and probably they'll be as rushed as the worgen and goblin failures (talking about the gear issues with 'em), and lots of people will stop playing in the summer ofc. If it's post summer they'll have lost so... many... subs, really spectacularly bad timing.</div></div><hr />

I actually believed them when they said they wouldn't make us wait like they did before and how they'd be oh so much faster. Well another season means we won't see WoD until summer. SoO for another half a year? Yeah fuck that. I'm sure fanboys will defend them though and try to spin this to be good in some way. They'll lose another couple million subs though at least so this will sting Blizzard. What blows my mind is they admitted they took away over 200 people from project Titan and put 100 of them to work on WoW again. They made it sound like a huge deal that we'd get that many more people working on WoW, but alas it didn't mean a thing.</div></div><hr />

I don't really mind. You can cancel subscription until WoD is released, why does it bother you so much? It sucks for Blizzard but players aren't forced to keep on playing without content.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nekobaka</div><div class="date">2014-01-08, 09:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The difference between ICC, DS and SoO is that ICC was pug friendly, you could log alts and do 4-6 bosses depending on the raid group, even more if you got into the great groups which downed upto and sometimes including 11 bosses. <br />
<br />
DS was abit less pug friendly then ICC but it was doable with decent group, at least the first bosses, plus running LFR wasn't so tedious like now, doing full SoO is annoying and takes around 4 hours in total, upto 6-8 if you get braindead people, at least DS lfr lasted 30 mins each wing so 1 hour total, 1.5-2 hours at most if you get idiotic groups. You're no way going to pug SoO normal, unless you're joinging some heroic 10/25 man guild doing alt runs and need someone to fill last spot, or top guild making a run you might down something.<br />
<br />
Also you can't even argue &quot;But you has flex!&quot; that's way different and the gear you get there is just slightly better then Timeless(upgraded) items.<br />
<br />
I just wish normal was more pug friendly, that alone would make content even more fun for those who can find something to do with alts.<br />
While I dont have experience in normal SoO and there is the other factor of SoO having more bosses. PuGs seeing only half ICC or less isnt so PuG friendly. PuGs clearing ToC is PuG friendly. T11 prenerf PuGs on my realm saw more than six bosses while taking far longer to get six bosses in ICC with the buff and post nerf T11 seeing full clears with a lot of slop that make early ToC look hard. With a smaller nerf to DS normal compared to the one for ICC, DS was made easier and faster to do in a PuG than in LFR. So many of the mechanics was ignored or cheesed in some manner compared to ICC with even LK being seen by a minority of raiders with the 30% buff.<br />
<br />
A repeat of ICC and Dragon Soul :P<br />
<br />
Ouch.<br />
Paired with an out of the gate rapid catch up mechanism to the final tier which Blizzard said prior was a problem with catch up dungeons and not wanting to repeat such rapid catch up did just that except with a different feature. Great for those who want to return and spend a month or two, but not so much for a subscription based game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
the trick with diablo 3 was enough for dragon soul - they will jsut throw in diablo 3 expansion to next annual pass and problem with SoO solved again and dont lie to yourself that people who were gonna buy d3 expansion and play wow from tiem to time wont buy annual pass like that :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
The small percentage of people that are crying for xrealm are the same ones whinging WoD is taking too long to come out.<br />
<br />
If Blizz start work on that it means it will be more months 90% of the playerbase has to wait to maybe satisfy a few cry babies.<br />
<br />
Also by the time Blizz could bring this out, who is left that actually wants to run normal anymore?<br />
<br />
Stop crying and wait for WoD<br />
<br />
Paying customers are cry babies for wanting content? This whole problem is down to poor planning on behalf Blizzard.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The only art piece that even resembles a disney theme is the Snow White dwarf. <br />
<br />
Otherwise, they're all crap with connections that are literally grasping at straws. That Blood Elf is supposed to be based on Princess Jasmine? Even though it looks nothing like her and isn't even wearing similar clothes? You can't just slap on a theme without putting any effort into a work of art.<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
Exactly. <br />
<br />
Instead they rather nerf or maybe even sell us level 90 characters like it will somehow fix the issue of boredom for experienced/good players who are now pulling whole instances to make it somewhat interesting...<br />
<br />
There is way too much &quot;protection&quot; in this game now. It's way too forgiving. <br />
If content is too hard for you then you can always take a step back. If content is too easy and boring for you you just have to deal with that. The hardest leveling content is easy.<br />
No, I am not going to level naked without xp bonuses just because Blizzard can't give us proper leveling content.<br />
<br />
You act as if WoW hasn't always had level restrictions on quests. Or many MMOs that predate WoW for that matter. You guys new or something?</div></div><hr />

I hear that, my sub expired yesterday had thought about renewing. Now with this announcement about another PvP season spanning an estimated 5+months; no thanks.</div></div><hr />

Learn some fricken people skills and stop being so bad at the game that no one wants you on their team. Think of it this way, even if they make SoO cross realm, you're gonna need those skills or else no one is gonna want to spend the time to down 14 bosses with you if you have a shit personality and you only want to be carried.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Robert3620</div><div class="date">2014-01-09, 04:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The idea that allowing cross realm normal and heroic raiding would delay WoD is absurd. They already allow for flex, lfr, dungeons, old content and other things to be allowed to be done cross realm. It would take zero effort to allow for SoO to be done so as well. This has been and remains about keeping a reason for server transfers and the fees it brings in. If you allow for current content to be done cross realm, from day one, you take the biggest reason for a person to server transfer away.</div></div><hr />
