<br />
Patch 4.2 Hotfixes - July 8<br />
July 8<br />
<br />
Classes<br />
<br />
Combat pets should no longer aggro creatures while the player is mounted.<br />
<br />
<br />
Dungeons &amp; Raids<br />
Firelands<br />
<br />
Baleroc<br />
<br />
Death knight Bloodworms are no longer removing stacks of Torment when they explode to heal other players.<br />
<br />
Ragnaros<br />
<br />
Molten Elementals are no longer able to critically hit players.<br />
The responsiveness of the Molten Power ability has been increased on Heroic difficulty.<br />
<br />
Rhyolith<br />
<br />
Multiple volcanoes casting Eruption will now create separate stacks. Crushing a volcano will cause its stacks of Eruption to fade shortly after.<br />
Ranged pets can no longer damage Rhyolith’s legs without beginning the encounter.<br />
<br />
The Ancient Lava Dweller can no longer be looted by engineers with the Loot-A-Rang.<br />
Unbound Pyrelords are no longer casting Ignite Elemental on the same target. All Unbound Smoldering Elementals should now be changed to Unbound Blazing Elementals by the time the pyrelord dies.<br />
The Unbreakable Shell buff present on Unbound Smoldering Elementals now reduces damage received by 50%, down from 90%.<br />
Unbound Smoldering Elementals are now correctly resetting and are no longer retaining Blazing Flame when they leave combat.<br />
<br />
<br />
Items<br />
<br />
Riplimb’s Lost Collar seemed to truly be lost. This item now properly has a chance to drop from select creatures.<br />
Several Ruthless Gladiator’s items have had their Stamina values increased to more appropriate levels.<br />
<br />
<br />
Season Transition Compensation<br />
We wanted to let everyone know that we’re working to address the miscommunication that occurred regarding the introduction of new item level 371 PvP gear, and share our current plans.<br />
<br />
For background, many players spent their Honor Points on item level 365 gear once Season 9 ended only to find that more powerful item level 371 gear was available when season 10 started. We should have communicated ahead of time that this was going to be the case, and we apologize for the mistake.<br />
<br />
We’ve been working over the past few days to evaluate and determine the best course of action to offer players some kind of compensation for those who were caught off guard by the new gear. The plan we’ve found to be achievable within an acceptable amount of time is to provide players who were affected with 4000 Honor Points. This extra Honor would function similarly to the currency down-conversion in that it would stack over the cap, but you would not be able to earn more until you spent under the 4000 cap.<br />
<br />
The process of determining who was affected is certainly the most difficult task of this issue, and the entire process of figuring out who should receive the Honor or not and then delivering it isn’t anything less than a giant undertaking. We’re still evaluating many of the processes that will be required to make this happen. Although we’re fairly confident we can pull it off, there is still a chance it may not be possible. Due to other service related work the soonest we would be able to distribute this Honor is the 7/19 Tuesday maintenance. More complicated solutions we discussed could take months to implement, but we felt getting something to those affected as quickly as possible was more important.<br />
<br />
Although some of this is still uncertain we felt it best to let people know as far in advance as possible to allow for adequate planning. We’ll be able to provide more information and specifics on how this process will be carried out, and the requirements to receive the 4000 Honor, next week.<br />
<br />
Again, we apologize for any inconvenience caused by our miscommunication. We greatly appreciate those who took the time to give us constructive feedback on the matter.<br />
<br />

Well not exactly. Blizzard intended to give all excess honor over 4k to players to spend the week before the new season. Instead it immediately changed that to gold on the day of the patch (and a week ahead of what they meant to do.) <br />
<br />
You could, theoretically, buy a bunch of pieces with that 50 million honor we have from our useless conquest points of the previous season that got downgraded. Then on patch day we could refund them one at time and buy the whole new set. :cool:</div></div><hr />

Um not really, you must be bad then.<br />
<br />
All they had to do was check to see who purchased 365 gear during last weeks time frame and upgrade it to the 371 or refund everyone the honor spent on it.<br />
<br />
Funny thing is, I guarantee you that if this happened to PVE gear it would have been hotfixed in a day or 2.</div></div><hr />

Well, maybe if you're retarded - judging from how Blizzard has handled every aspect of PvP this expansion (PLAY NICE GUYS DON'T MMR EXPLOIT OR WE'LL COVER IT UP WITH A BLANKETLOL), there may be a few chromosomes missing in a handful of people around the Actiblizzion headquarters.</div></div><hr />

Actually, based on the amount of guilds who have downed Rag already, I would say this tier is fairly easy. Over 1600 guilds with normal mode down after 4 days is pretty crazy. <br />

<br />
as far as the whole firelands tracking again kinda sucks 1 week cleared on normal and more then likely we will see a full heroic clear within the end of the week. its such a shame that we waited months and months for something to excite us into raiding again because really all tier 11 content looked like to me was wotlk mechanics +1 the boss fights were insanely easy and now the only substance for players is half a raid (yeah only 7 bosses) that you can easily pass through, the only challange is getting to exalted which then again isnt even a challange its more like a reward getting those 391 rings for sitting out and grinding your MC 2.0 rep out to exalted.<br />
<br />
and granted im not one of the top 1% of the game right now to be doing heroic FL , something i may not see for awhile its still alittle dissapointing to see guilds slam through content like it was a combo meal at your burger joint.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Only the adds can be 25man settings, maybe his turn speed... Volcano spawns are the same in both 25 and 10 but he also walks at the same speed so if your dps isnt bad at turning (which has been fixed), then volcanos shouldnt be an issue as long as you make him walk over volcanos in order they spawned.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, it's more like releasing 5man Heroics with almost the same item quality as the Raids available and make that gear you farmed for your alts completely useless.<br />

Just because professionals makes something look easy doesn't mean that it is easy. You even said in your post that you are not doing Heroic FL so why do you complain that it is too easy?<br />
<br />
I watched a show once where someone swallowed swords and juggled with flaming torches, knives and other stuff that could kill you. It looked easy as hell when they did that but I would never try something like that because it is NOT easy and it would probably kill me.</div></div><hr />

However, the same cannot be said in an economy that the United Kingdom currently is experiencing. In addition, investing in properties these days can be very risky and if you are careless. You can lose a lot of money and at the worse, be financially devastated. But then again, experienced investors are usually creative and are often after investing their time and money in properties which are Below Market Value and for good reasons. For one, they can take advantage of the property's available equity even if the market is not at its best. They can eventually choose to utilise the equity that they obtained by selling the property and get immediate cash for it and or at the same time, have tenants rent so that they can profit from it.<br />
<br />
The drawback however in choosing to invest in such a business is that looking for a property that is below market value and where you can invest your money is challenging. Those who have been in the same business could actually attest to that. The good news is that you, as an investor need not worry about going through the trouble of finding one. We can provide you with numerous below market value properties from our reliable network of information and with it, provide you the services you need to start your investment. For a fact, these available properties are those that are sold to us by home sellers who were in need of cash in a short timeframe.<br />
<br />
With our services, you just have to blow away your anxieties and leave your plans to us. In addition, we are supported by various professionals in the same business that will be more than willing to assist you in looking for an investment property. Not only will you be relieved to know that you will have a reasonable amount of equity to start with but unlike other methods, this will save you a lot of trouble, time and ultimately, unnecessary expenditures.</div></div><hr />

Please try to read before you post.<br />
<br />
I did chap and I still stay the same. I mean for gods sake... this site shows constantly new digs up from PTR. I am fairly sure there were new PvP sets publicized not so long ago. Even without it people should still see that coming. There were constant blizz fart through megaphones about point conversions after each patch goes live and clear signs they would do that everywhere, even if in not stated obviously. <br />
<br />
Besides whats the logic and justification of buying old stuff for honor points when you blantly knew that points conversation system will allow you to purchase new and better gear for the very same currency?<br />
<br />
At what point would it was so clouded and uncertain that the very thing they did for PvE would be suddenly be scrapped for PvP despite having a similiar system with one better and one worse currency. Yes it is a bit different gear but the problem is the same. Some PvP chaps simply didnt looked into the future and somehow found it a good idea to waste the points now instead of saving them for later.<br />
<br />
If they didnt said so then it would not happen, even if it was so blantly obvious and easy to forsee? I wonder if it there would be a same big riot if they didnt announced it but instead introduced current conquest gear for honor gear in similiar fashion as they did with PvE gear.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Seriously, majordomo is harder in 10man mode right now than it is 25, you need 8 people grouping and degrouping for form change and after being around 30% you face with losing 1-2 or of the people in group and when that happens you get screwed big time, for the current gear level, 10m Heroic is even more strict, some of the fights maybe easier on 10m, however, Staghelm is not one of them.</div></div><hr />

Due to other service related work the soonest we would be able to distribute this Honor is the 7/19 Tuesday maintenance.
