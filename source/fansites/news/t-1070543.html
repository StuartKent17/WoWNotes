Patch 4.3.2 Release Date Update<br />
The status of the patch is still unsure, the whole situation is most likely the reason why the US Maintenance got cancelled (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/3941316015) and then moved to Wednesday (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/3941417517). <br />
<br />
The patch files are available on the download servers and things look somewhat ready but at this point it seems that the patch will only go live next week. The EU maintenance wasn't moved to Thursday and I don't think Blizzard plans to deploy a patch on both continents on the same day, even if it's a small one. <br />

Statistics: Heroic Madness of Deathwing Class Representation<br />
Continuing our ongoing statistics posts, today we look at class representation for characters that have completed Heroic Madness of Deathwing. As always with this type of post, the sample size is fairly small; less than 100 guilds have completed the encounter so far. <br />

Blue Posts<br />
Blue Post Replies<br />
We read them. We also allow conversations to take place without our influence when it seems that it's the better course of action. Sometimes our intervention can actually skew a conversation off track if we're not careful. Then again, sometimes skewing a conversation is something we need to do too, to get people &quot;on track&quot; or even away from non-constructive discussion.<br />
<br />
Sometimes we just don't have anything we could effectively add to the conversation, but it may spark some discussion internally that we can have amongst ourselves or take to the developers and producers. If and when we do have something we can bring back, we generally try to. Some may be under the false belief that it was the constant posts about a topic that made us come back to the topic, when in fact we may just need some time to discuss and come up with an answer that works and sometimes, we may have an answer that we just can't share at the time. Timing in our roles is often everything and as many know, &quot;promising&quot; something too soon, can be upsetting or worrisome to some people, while others don't mind being &quot;in the know&quot; even if plans do change. It's a balancing act.<br />
<br />
We don't have elaborate schemes. That would mean we have a lot more time on our hands than we actually do to sit, plot and plan. In most cases, when we reply to something on the forums, we're tightrope walking while keeping an eye on the ever so dangerous ps and qs. That's not to say there isn't a method to the madness (see above paragraph.) It just means, we have to be quick on developing our thoughts and typing them out in a way that (hopefully) makes some semblance of sense.<br />
<br />
If we see some really good feedback or ideas, we will often take it with us when we meet with the developers (which is generally a weekly face to face meeting.) We don't want to give the wrong impression that feedback given equals a guaranteed change based on that feedback. <br />
<br />
We are just as likely to notice a smaller thread as we are to notice the larger ones. Sometimes, the best conversations are on the first few pages (not to say we don't read through the entire thread.) The reason being, that often, the conversation is more focused on the topic at hand and as the thread lengthens, we either see repeat discussions/arguments, or it begins to expand to other topics that may not be as relevant to the main topic of the original post.<br />
<br />
BTW, contrary to popular belief (and not to start a moderation discussion.) We do not delete threads solely on the idea that it's saying it dislikes something we've designed or done to the game. We generally delete non-constructive threads or repeat threads since they often don't lead to good discussion or split conversation which makes it more difficult for us to sift through them for the constructive bits.

64-bit Live Client<br />
We'll be disabling the PTR forums shortly. Going forward you will be able to find the latest 64-bit client on the Tech Support forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/3941417051#11).

Mists of Pandaria Information Plan<br />
There does and there is. There's not anything specific I can share on a time frame as of yet, but things are moving along well with Mists of Pandaria and we'll be getting you all more information on &quot;what's next&quot; as soon as possible. For those that were able to see the next expansion at BlizzCon, you'll have seen that we were relatively far along in development. As we've said before, we're working diligently to put out expansions a little bit quicker than we have in the past. But, as always, we want to make sure we release &quot;when it's ready&quot; as well.

Don't be ridiculous, PvE hunter representation has nothing to do with focus it has to do with scaling issues, poor balance design and poor survivability. PvP is a different story</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've seen that a lot in the top guilds especially in direct regard to Deathwing's fight(s).<br />
<br />
Even though I personally have not done the encounters on heroic, I can see where a Hunter is at extreme disadvantage on Spine compared to a Mage: higher on-demand AoE damage that won't stray to corruptions accidentally, higher on-demand burst damage that doesn't rely on a pet having to travel around to get set to your higher average DPS, so on....<br />
<br />
I think it more has to do with the design of the encounter itself, though, that puts a higher emphasis on rapid burst and shorter DPS cooldowns for guilds that are absolutely concerned with minmaxing and raid stacking.</div></div><hr />

They should buff passive focus regen, and reduce active (cobra/steady) regen. They should stop over-nerfing coefficients to our signature shots, and then later bandaid fixing us by adding AP to Aspect of the Hawk. We are increasingly penalized for utilizing Aspect of the Fox to the point where it isn't even really worth it on heavy movement fights.<br />
<br />
If Kill Shot is going to cost no focus, it may as well be off the GCD. Right now, especially if you have it glyphed, it is very disruptive in the &lt;20% phase.<br />
<br />
They should buff our ranged weapon damage for the remainder of the tier.</div></div><hr />

Hunter DPS is low compared to melee, period. Hunter DPS is also lower than mages and multi-dotting casters, and any legendary caster.<br />
<br />
Getting the additional 10% AP that melee got would do a lot to alleviate this among other changes. Hunters are the only class with a small resource pool both an inadequate passive resource regen rate. This combined with Aspect of the Fox is extremely detrimental on high movement fights.<br />
<br />
Just look at this: http://raidbots.com/dpsbot/Ultraxion/25H/100/14/60/default/<br />
<br />
Ultraxion 25H...<br />
<br />
The top hunter spec (survival) is behind the top spec of every other DPS class except druids. And in the case of feral druids that is ONLY because they can't shred on Ultraxion. Marksman and Beast Mastery are predictably dead last.<br />
<br />
Look at how bad hunters are for Blackhorn: http://raidbots.com/dpsbot/Warmaster_Blackhorn/25H/100/14/60/default/</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dracodraco</div><div class="date">2012-01-25, 01:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">For all the people going &quot;Lol can't compare hunters to classes with more than 1 spec&quot;, sure you can. My *alt* resto druid has a 395 main resto spec and a 392 off boomkin spec, making it perfectly viable for heroic dragon soul, no matter which of the two roles. So mains should be more than able to do that. <br />
Besides, hi 10.57% rogue and 9.8% mage representation.<br />
<br />
And just to clarify - there's actually only two encounters hunters does well on at the moment, and that is Hagara, and *drumroll* Madness. Due to the way Spellweave works with dots, and serpent spread works for a surv hunter, we can get completly incredible burst on the adds, making the P2 burst quite trivial, and the P1 burst... Well, was never a problem anyway I guess.<br />
But point being, hunters are GOOD on this fight. I mean, the one out of two things our deterrence can block is the elementium bolt, for crying out loud... <br />
Yet, we have the lowest representation by far.<br />
<br />
<br />
And for the ones saying &quot;Lol chill, less than 100 guilds killed the encounter&quot; - SO WHAT, really. I don't care how many guilds have killed it, hunters are so bad that the hunters from the best guilds in the world are not being brought in. Mind you, by proxy, that would mean that some of the best hunters in the world are either playing alts on those encounters, or being sat, due to their class - because they didn't suddenly lose all their &quot;skill&quot; from T11-12. <br />
<br />
<br />
Although, in the end, I'm much more interested in Spine - is there any chance we could have a &quot;class breakdown&quot; for spine heroic, just to see HOW bad the class stacking actually is? I mean, I *know* it's bad. But just to get a view of it. According to WoL, 32 hunters has killed it in 10 man (which is much more leniently tuned), and 26 have killed it in 25 man, according to public WOL's.<br />
There's been 130 10 man heroic kills, and 128 25 man heroic kills.<br />
Isn't that just a little disturbing? Less than 25% of the kills have had hunters in them.</div></div><hr />

What? No, they're the lowest because they do awful DPS in PvE currently, so nobody would bring them to tough fights if they can help it. Guilds have stopped recruiting them and gearing them up. Even if they're good on Madness itself, guilds don't have geared hunters to bring in.</div></div><hr />

Not possible. The software that pulls these numbers checks for the achivement - they can't check for spec used when the achivement was aquired.

Maybe in 5 man increments? offering scaling difficulty and rewards. Seems many groups are a few people too short or too many to reach 25 mans, when a 15 or 20 man would be the fix.

Difficult sure, not impossible though.<br />

Anyways, I find it interesting that hunters were top and most represented in T11, were pretty good in T12 and have just kind of disappeared in T13 =/</div></div><hr />

When Shamans weren't brought for every other end-tier boss everyone moaned about &quot;Shaman's need some love&quot; &quot;Buff Shamans&quot; &quot;Shamans suck ass&quot; etc etc etc... Now that they are a preferred class to bring to Madness... I see moaning yet again. The community of this game... I'm just gonna go with wow. WoW's community is wow.... Where was I? Oh yeah... wow. :D<br />
<br />
Sorry, but this isn't a turn-based affair. I don't care if Shaman's have been shit for every patch since the game's release, there's no excuse for an obscenely OP class.<br />
<br />
Not to say shamans are &quot;obscenely OP,&quot; I'm just shitting on the &quot;it's our turn&quot; idiocy.</div></div><hr />

Why do they strive to achieve PvE balance between specs, when they make such a ridiculous fight like madness ? Truth be told - you can't beat a good shadow priest on that encounter, even if you outgear them.<br />
<br />
I always top the meter on madness in my guild by a mile as a shadow priest even though I'm the least geared dps in my group. We have an affl lock with legendary and overall better gear and he trails me on damage done by several %. Now I'm not some pve goddess mind you, I'm a pretty average player who pays attention. But I also play on a HORRIBLE laptop which drops my fps to &lt;10 on that fight and at 500-600 ms (I'm in Eastern Europe, playing on a US server). So I'd say shadow is a pretty damn good spec for that fight if even I can pull the numbers I pull with subpar gear and my technical limitations.<br />
<br />
Although to be fair I think the dps in my group aren't all that good to begin with, considering I do more than twice anyone else's damage to bolts as well.</div></div><hr />

Duh, which was my point. Why release information like this when it so obviously doesn't show anything and is so obviously screwed up by the fact that classes who can fill different rolls will clearly have a larger representation. Basically don't present information like this if you can't do a spec breakdown. otherwise i have enjoyed the other charts.</div></div><hr />

<br />
How come Warlocks have about 3.5% more than hunter, and mages and rogues have about 6% more representation then. If you can't see that theres something wrong with atleast hunters compared to any other pure dps, then I don't really know what to do. <br />
<br />
<br />
Also, people care about the class representation on madness, because believe it or not, alot of the top end players the world over frequents these forums. Its not just socials and &quot;bads&quot;. Every guild from the top 100 has atleast a few members on this site.</div></div><hr />

So it takes a nerf to the content to let guilds bring a hunter? Awesome class design!!<br />

<br />
This was predicted in Wrath and it's what happened (only Arm Pen MM Hunters generally got to see ICC and once Arm Pen disappeared in 4.0 so did Hunter damage). It was predicted in Cata after Blizz didn't change the formulas behind our shots and look what's happened.</div></div><hr />

People have been asking for charts anyway. Doesn't matter how pointless it may seem. :|</div></div><hr />

Its just weird watching her read the news. Its like she is paralyzed or something. She could be much more interesting if they would either tell her to use her arms and hands to be more expressive or just remove the lower half of her body from the video so we just don't see her there being limp<br />
<br />
Can everyone stop commenting on Pico's goddamn movement... it's no doubt getting to her.<br />
<br />
You know she USED to move her arms a lot, and be very animated, twitching around.. people complained. So she stood still. Then, people complained that she was too still, so now she moves a bit. Now you're complaining she's not as she was to start with.<br />
