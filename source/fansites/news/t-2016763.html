<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
Still no changes to Affliction... Ok Blizzard.<br />
<br />
Not sure I understand your complain, aff got heavily nerfed 3 patches Ago, and still last patch got a 3d nerf on drain soul, making it pretty much useless. Cant even compete with the other 2 warlocks specs in PvE and altho is better than demon for PvP, its not even close to destruction.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't get what its function is now. It only lasts 10 seconds so it's basically a CD you use when in burn phase, but doesnt have any kind of cooldown and has 2 charges so...do you just always have it available and use it during each burn rotaton?<br />
<br />
Also interesting change to Phoenix Flames. It's basically a second, stronger AOE Fire Blast now. How would that be worked into a rotation where you cant camp pyros? Use on opening and then use when you dont get a heating up? Just use when fire blast is on CD? It seems too strong to not always be using it on cooldown...</div></div><hr />

Right here. :) What they've done to BM Hunters is, I'm convinced, aimed to ruin them so thoroughly so as to stop their being so many BM Hunters in the world (of Warcraft). It has gone from my most fun spec/class to my least currently, and nothing meaningful has been changed in response to the overwhelming negative feedback since Alpha.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Rune of Power has a 45 second recharge and 2 charges lasting 10 seconds now. So yea its a damage buff cooldown like AP... but Rune of Power was already the best of the bunch... I don't get why it needed to be buffed more while Mirror Image and Incanter's Flow are left as they are.</div></div><hr />

I was thinking more along the lines of the damage/healing numbers than the actual spec overhaul. But yes, I do feel bad for BM in that respect.</div></div><hr />

I know the feeling. I've played a rogue since Closed Beta of Vanilla in 2004. It's not uncommon to receive little to no changes, even when the majority believe changes could be made. But I'm sure we'll find a way to be just fine, and then we'll be noticed if we hit #1 on the charts lol.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ah, my mistake. I misunderstood. ...Although they also don't seem to have done any real numbers tuning with BM in quite a few builds. Of course, I suppose it's hard to balance it when pets/pet commands are still buggy as hell and your permanent pet, Hati, can die with a 2 minute rez timer during fights. :D</div></div><hr />
