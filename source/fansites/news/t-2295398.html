Ghostcrawler Tweets<br />
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br />
I stopped visiting the WoW forums a while back for reasons I no longer remember. I’ve started visiting them now and then, but it’s such a different feel. With the ability for everyone to upvote and downvote individual posts, there’s a very strong echo chamber in effect. There seem to be “acceptable” and “unacceptable” opinions to have regarding the game, flying, difficulty/reward structures, etc. It discourages the minority from posting. What’s the value in a forum rating system?<br />
I’m not a fan of upvoting or downvoting, myself, even on our own forums. I think the intent is noble, of being able to bury spam or promote really insightful ideas, but what generally happens is you upvote things that agree with you and downvote things you don’t agree with, no matter how well structured their arguments are.

Hopefully when the gating is done there is more variety to the Argus WQ, because right now there's like 4-5 quests and a bunch that are just killing Elites. Not exactly a system that has staying power...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Of course there is plenty of staying power! They put multiple mounts into one Paragon Chest! So instead of being able to fish for the mounts from a variety of systems, you just grind AoL again and again and again and again and... *Dies*</div></div><hr />

Good that europe gets patched on wednesdays, ergo 5 days. Maybe it got normalized across the regions or it will simply increase on mondays.<br />
We will see.</div></div><hr />

<br />
9 times higher chance for titanforge? :)<br />
At least I like that the traits on the relics are for the new one from 7.2.<br />
Invasion points will add also some variety to the argus experience.</div></div><hr />

Nobody said the weekly reset would be moving to monday. They just noticed that, because it released on monday, it means it's not tied to the weekly reset (because monday isn't wednesday).<br />
<br />
Start trying to read before being contemptuous, because in the end, you're just ridiculous.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ophenia</div><div class="date">2017-09-05, 06:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">They are daily quests, like always.<br />
<br />
I know. But I have the feeling there is a quests pool containing 8 WQ for the Antoran Wastes with 5 or 6 being active every 12 hours. At least, WQ on Broken Isles had a bit more variety.<br />
Everyday since Wednesday, I have done the same WQ over and over and over and over. No variety at all, the only exception was the WQ where you were bombing Legion's forces from the lightforged exoskeleton on day 1.<br />
<br />
Plus, most of the WQs are Elites.<br />
<br />
Plus, all the WQ rewarding stuff are rewarding the same 3 relics. That's cool if you want to bruteforce a titanforge on a said relic, but a bit more variety with the traits would be great. But I guess this is tied with the Netherlight Crucible, Blizzard didn't really want to create several relics so they just created one and we'll have to hope being lucky with the procs if we want other traits.</div></div><hr />

so writing a posting saying .. the weekly reset will not be on monday ( cuz the content got released on monday ) is just more than bullshit and wrong.<br />
if they would have said there wont be a bonus point after the weekly reset on wednesday, it would be a correct sentense...<br />

thats why i said .. ofc its not monday ( 1 week after release) cuz the reset is on wednesday. nnoone expected it to be happen on monday since the weekly reset is wednesday since years....<br />

No you're wrong we got the AK increase on MONDAY (from 41 to 42) not Wednesday.<br />
<br />
Nobody said anything about them moving the weekly server reset. We're just observing that the AK increases are NOT linked with server resets. They could be every 5 days like the research work orders were, or they could be juist on Mondays. we don;t know yet</div></div><hr />

The post says it is NOT tied to the weekly reset. Nobody is fucking saying that the reset is being moved. MMO champ is merely pointing out that the AK has increased yesterday, not on wednesday like we thought it would. It in fact, had already increased when you posted your post.</div></div><hr />

No. That's what that news is saying: the weekly bonus came BEFORE the reset.<br />

Well, now that Blizzard has done away with downvoting, their forum is just a hugbox of upvotes that can no longer silence trolls. Well done.<br />
<br />
Remove upvotes too, or reinstate downvotes. There is no middle ground here. You cannot have one without the other.</div></div><hr />
