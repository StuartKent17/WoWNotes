The week-end has been .... interesting and I guess it's time to clarify a few facts :<br />
<br />
You're so wrong!<br />
Tons of people out there won't trust everything they read on the interweb, and I'm totally fine with that. But if you want to discuss about how wrong I am please do it in a nice way, you don't have to be aggressive and a lot of people got banned for that. I will probably clean up the bans from the last days after the Blizzcon but we can't really afford to let the forums get out of control with insults and spams. If you feel that you didn't deserve your ban at all just mail me and I'll try to have a look at it. <br />

Something Awful isn't reliable!<br />
I didn't want to hide the source of the quote posted a few minutes after my news post but I think a lot of people misunderstood that. After I posted the original information, a post appeared on Something Awful with a few extra details and I eventually merged it when it turned out to be ... reliable. The only details added from this post were :<br />
<br />
The &quot;big&quot; changes to the existing lore (I don't want to spoil it again, you know what I'm talking about)<br />
Gnomeregan possibly retaken by gnomes<br />
Blackrock Spire eruption.<br />
<br />
And I think that's it, everything else was from my own personal work and is data gathered from multiple sources over the last month. <br />
<br />
Just lay down the pitchforks for the moment, the Blizzcon is only in 4 days and you'll have the rest of the year to laugh at me if what I posted is indeed wrong, there are enough french jokes in the world to do that. For the moment it's just a pre-Blizzcon leak, we have them each year and you should be used to it by now.<br />
<br />
Of course, each year, a lot of sites are wrong and I could be one of them. Nothing of what I posted was confirmed or commented by Blizzard.<br />
<br />
<br />
Blue posts<br />
No reason to freeze the site until the Blizzcon, we're back to blue posts.<br />
Changes to /castrandom macros<br />
The way we changed (&quot;broke&quot;) castrandom was that if it fails, it continues to try and cast the same spell again. This means it will still work as you intend for randomly casting mounts or using different versions of Polymorph since those won't generally fail. We have no objection to using castrandom in that fashion, which was honestly more of the original intent for the macro.<br />
<br />
Where we don't like castrandom is when players wanted to use the macro instead of having to pay attention to procs and cooldowns. That's just not the way we really want players playing WoW. There are some great games were part of the challenge is trying to automate your character as much as possible to respond to whatever happens. We just don't want WoW to be one of them.<br />
<br />
In those situations where you feel utterly dependent on a macro because our default UI isn't cutting it, please help us to identify them (though don't feel obligated to turn the rest of this thread into that discussion). We'd rather make the class or UI work better rather than balance around the assumption that everyone castrandom macros the ability.<br />
<br />
The legendary DK one-button macro is an interesting beast. It tended to work because it defaulted to Icy Touch a lot since most other abilities require melee. At the time, Icy Touch hit really, really hard. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/19109959321-castrandom-whats-up.html))<br />

Stoneskin Gargoyle on Dual-Wielding DK Tanks<br />
Keep in mind that quote was before we decided that Frost could be focused towards dual-wield. We have no problems with Frost DKs tanking with two weapons.<br />
<br />
The original logic behind Stoneskin Gargoyle remains though -- there generally are not two-handed tanking weapons, so hitting say the defense cap can be harder. A DW Frost DK can use two tanking swords. Grab one of them Quel things. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/19378297749-stoneskin-gargoyle-for-dual-wielding-dk-tanks.html))<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/idruids.gif Druid <br />
Druid survavibility<br />
We don't necessarily want druids to be very tanky in all forms. You already get passive defenses in bear, moonkin, tree and to a lesser extent, cat. We want shifting to caster / travel to be a slight risk. It should be a decision you make based on the situation and not an automatic response. More below. <br />
<br />
Saris's idea was to move Improved Barkskin to shallow Balance instead of deep resto.<br />
It’s an interesting idea, but we didn’t want to rearrange talent trees especially for a mid-tier patch like this. However, you can see based on my previous response too that Imp Barskin might be a problematic talent in general. On the one hand, we want to get druids (of all trees) shifting more. That should just be a druid thing. On the other hand, we want it to be some kind of decision, and that is generally that caster form gives you more tools but at a hefty survivability cost. Imp Barskin tried to make that cost a little cheaper, but maybe that’s not the right way to go. We need to think some more at a high-level about what we really want the druid strategy in PvP to be. <br />
<br />
I'm not so sure that &quot;druid out of form = death&quot; is actually a strong design. <br />
Yeah. But I’m not sure that druid forms are just an extra button* you have to use before you use another button is a great design either. To be a little self-critical, I don’t think we have nailed the right balance of shifting for warriors, Shadow priests or DKs either.<br />
<br />
* - In before &quot;GC don't know druids.&quot; I realize using a spell from caster form will pop you out, but the fact remains that either shifting is a no-brainer or it isn't. We have been sending some mixed messages on that of late I fear. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/19110416931-balance-druid-moonkin-pvp-is-not-there-yet.html))<br />

Nerfing threat in 3.2.2<br />
We don't think &quot;high threat tanks&quot; is a fun niche for the game. We don't mind some variation depending on the specific situation, but paladin OTs were accidentally pulling off of MTs an awful lot. That isn't a L2P issue. That's just the numbers being off and frustrating everyone.<br />
<br />
We didn't want to nerf threat until community perception had turned around that paladins could survive while tanking hard modes.<br />
<br />
Try out the hard Coliseum fights (once available) or the tougher ones in Ulduar and let us know how it feels. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/19110239984-why-are-you-nerfing-threat.html))<br />
<br />
Seal of Command changes in 3.2.2<br />
The idea was always that Seals were a choice. We have just iterated on them so much this patch that one of them kept coming up as the only real Seal. Hopefully this latest design will work out. <br />
<br />
If an attack procs a seal of command then that seal of command can chain onto up to two different targets.<br />
That is correct, with one clarification. It must be a single-target attack. If the attack is already multi-target like DS, then only the damage procs, not the cleave. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/19110299733-gc--you-got-it-right--322-soc-paladin.html))<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/irogues.gif Rogue<br />
Fan of Knives nerf in 3.2.2<br />
We sat on a change for awhile because we hoped FoK spam was a flavor-of-the-month thing. We thought there was a chance the community would come up with a way to counter it, and since it's pretty much a one-trick pony, there would be no reason to keep trying it. The community absolutely comes up with counters on its own -- the answer to every new strategy should not immediately be for us to nerf it. We also hoped the resilience changes would chill out the damage enough that rogues would stop pursuing FoK spam. That doesn't seem to be happening.<br />
<br />
It is a nerf in PvE, but honestly it's probably a nerf that was also needed. We wanted to give rogues some AE damage, and we were okay with the big numbers for a long time because they were big when fights were short, but not as good over longer AE fights. (Protip: AE doesn't just equal trash these days.) Few people would argue that rogue single-target dps on most fights isn't amazing (&quot;jaw-dropping&quot;? ;) ). As long as rogues can still contribute meaningfully to AE fights, which they will be able to do, they shouldn't be in any danger of being sidelined.<br />
<br />
It's possible some select fights, notably Yogg 0, may be too difficult without the interrupt, but the encounter designers are prepared to make changes accordingly, and everyone will have access to better gear in the new raid tier anyway.<br />
<br />
I asked a rogue in our guild if she thought Blizzard would nerf Fan. She said &quot;They probably need to, but it was fun while it lasted.&quot;<br />
<br />
The greatest casualty is probably the loss of so many FoKing puns. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/19110159897-can-rogues-get-some-reasoning.html))<br />

But if it turns out that you were right and you predicted true fact, 3 or 4 month before official statement you know what happen??? NOTHING. You get no attention at all if you are right, but you rise hell when you are wrong. Sad but true.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You have to understand that it's not always possible to give sources without compromising them.<br />
Some people have a written contract (NDA - non disclosure agreement) which prevents them from stating anything. Yet, still stuff leaks at times. Much like last year WotLK had several leaks even though everyone in the pre alpha was bound by a NDA.<br />
<br />
If BB had the original source up, but the source didn't want to be publicized then obviously BB would have to remove it or face repercussions. Both from blizzard to the source, and possibly said source.<br />
<br />
So, yeah, lay down the pitchfork and wait it out.<br />
It's only 4 days after all.</div></div><hr />

Oh, I've laid down my pitchfork already. I was in a fervor of posting for an hour or two after the news post hit, after which I decided to just lay off and see what Blizzcon brings.<br />
<br />
But more on topic, I understand completely about not being able to fully disclose the source due to possible repercussions and NDAs and all that good stuff. But just because he can't say WHO the source is, can he not at least give a general idea of WHERE the source is in relation to the design/development team? (There's no sarcasm there, the question is in earnest)</div></div><hr />

Hehe yeah good times.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Number keys can no longer activate character abilities. In many cases, this gave certain players a slight advantage over those that used their mouse to activate their abilities. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Night Elves will now lose a small percentage of experience after jumping. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
*Run speed reduced by approximately 20% when in Bear Form and Dire Bear Form. It should now feel more &quot;bear-like&quot; for players when changing into these forms. <br />
*Gnomes can now select Druids as an available class! New Cub and Kitty forms available! <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Dwarf Females now generate rage at a rate three times greater than normal. <br />

Keep in mind that quote was before we decided that Frost could be focused towards dual-wield. We have no problems with Frost DKs tanking with two weapons.<br />
<br />
The original logic behind Stoneskin Gargoyle remains though -- there generally are not two-handed tanking weapons, so hitting say the defense cap can be harder. A DW Frost DK can use two tanking swords. Grab one of them Quel things. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/19378297749-stoneskin-gargoyle-for-dual-wielding-dk-tanks.html))<br />
<br />
Does this mean Quel'Serrar is being changed next patch so Dk's can wield it also? Noticed from the datamining that there was an updated (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/49303/gleaming-quelserrar/)(?) one, however never knew the class requirements for it were being changed? ???<br />

@FoK changes: It was to be expected. Even in beta of WotLK rogue forums were full of surprise posts about FoK and no-one expected it to be going live like it is now. But still it did and lasted quite long.<br />

I would seriously be happy with just a small bit of info about the sources, not necessarily specific persons or organizations, but a general idea of &quot;how close to Blizz&quot; this info is coming from.<br />
<br />
As of now, I've lost a little bit of the trust and respect I had in this site, and something like that would give me back a lot of what I lost.<br />
<br />
<br />
And if Boubouille had any need to answer to you then that would be important. It's amazing what people think they're entitled to just because they pop on to a free website on a regular basis. If all of the items that were posted this weekend turn out to be true (or even a lot of them) then the people who were raising hell will just slip into the shadows with no one to stand there pointing a finger at them for being such turds. If the predictions turn out to be wrong then you can be sure that hundreds of people will do that to Boubouille in return. I love the info that's given on this website. If the post turns out to be 100% false then I still don't see the huge deal... it was stated very up front at the start of the post that none of the information is confirmed... if you can't read that and understand it for what it is then that's your problem.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">angryfork</div><div class="date">2009-08-17, 11:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think a lot of people failed to appreciate the bit at the top of Boubouille's previous post: &quot;None of the information below has been officialy announced by Blizzard, this is only a compilation of information gathered from reliable sources. Just keep in mind that it takes a LOT to make me post something on the front page and I'm definitely not speculating here.&quot;<br />
<br />
It's pretty clear we should take it for what it is--information Boubouille believes to be well-founded--and leave it at that. If it's accurate, it's accurate, and if it's not, it's not. Nobody can come away from this saying they were mislead into believing inaccurate reporting.<br />
<br />
If you only care for verbatim reports of blue posts, and don't want to hear anything until it's stated by Blizzard staff on the record, that's fine. Just ignore the things in which you're not interested; it's pretty clearly distinguished.</div></div><hr />

Nerfing threat in 3.2.2<br />
We don't think &quot;high threat tanks&quot; is a fun niche for the game. We don't mind some variation depending on the specific situation, but paladin OTs were accidentally pulling off of MTs an awful lot. That isn't a L2P issue. That's just the numbers being off and frustrating everyone.<br />
<br />
We didn't want to nerf threat until community perception had turned around that paladins could survive while tanking hard modes.<br />
<br />
Try out the hard Coliseum fights (once available) or the tougher ones in Ulduar and let us know how it feels. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/19110239984-why-are-you-nerfing-threat.html))<br />
<br />
<br />
i do tank the hard modes on my pally in ulduar its fun, If there still droping the Righteous Fury threat they should make a new glyphs to help up the threat again to make it more usefull then cause droping the threat is the wrong way to go as Warlocks and mages and rogues can easly jump over our threat and keep going by a mile so our threat shouldn't be nerfed to help other tanks increase theres abit!! ffs</div></div><hr />

Tons of people out there won't trust everything they read on the interweb, and I'm totally fine with that. But if you want to discuss about how wrong I am please do it in a nice way, you don't have to be aggressive and a lot of people got banned for that. I will probably clean up the bans from the last days after the Blizzcon but we can't really afford to let the forums get out of control with insults and spams. If you feel that you didn't deserve your ban at all just mail me and I'll try to have a look at it.<br />

I'm pretty sure when that was said by Ghostcrawler, Boub wasn't the first person to think there were actually 31 bosses and make comment on it through way of a post. Oh and that also came straight out of a developer's mouth too and he did apologize for it, but yet it is being used against mmo-c as &quot;gospel truth&quot; on the current topic at hand. Try again.<br />

There's a fine line between &quot;bad attitude&quot; and (I really feel my soul weaken by saying this...) &quot;obvious troll being obvious&quot;. While someone throwing a little hissy fit saying how they hate the &quot;content leak&quot; is one thing, it is totally another to outright attack and offend Boub for posting this and pretty much harassing him over it.<br />

<br />
Wow, there are an awful lot of nasty little teenagers that post on these boards, aren't there...<br />
<br />
a) Do you seriously expect Boub to publish his sources (who are clearly at the very least tangentially connected to Blizzard) so they can be fired from their jobs and lose him the sources he's so carefully cultivated? How is it possible that you can fail so utterly to comprehend the basic logic behind anonymous sources? i.e. that they like to remain anonymous? You choose to believe or not believe the person who quoted their sources on the basis of the veracity of their previous claims. Boub has been right in 95% of the cases he's put forward, if not more, therefore I choose to believe that he has some inside information. You have no alternate opposing evidence to put forward, therefore you're nothing but another dick swinging in the wind trying to sound like The Man.<br />
b) The 31 bosses was a direct quote from a Blizzard source. There you go- you wanted sources, that was a DIRECT quote, not a suggestion from Boub based on anonymous sources. Turned out it was a bad joke by Blizzard, but how you can blame Boub for that escapes me.<br />
c) Why are you so angry about this? Why are you so keen to lambaste Boub? He hasn't done anything other than report what his sources tell him. He doesn't need to drum up publicity for his site, it's already the most-read WOW site on the web. The risk he would take in fabricating this would be ludicrous, he'd be risking his livelihood on something that would 100% be found out- do you really think he'd be so idiotic? You're acting like Boub is some kind of Freudian father-figure to be hated and brought down, like he's the bully in the playground who you want to overthrow. Get a grip kid, he's a hard working bloke who publishes a hell of a lot of very interesting information for the benefit of all WOW players.<br />
<br />

You realise that every news outlet in the world uses anonymous sources, right? Ever heard of Watergate?

Weren't you fucking off to another site? Oh, you're still here? Let me repeat what I said, since you're clearly too brainless to get it. Boub has sources. Sources who are anonymous. The post he made was not idle speculation on his part, it wasn't a whim, it was a collated set of leaks and pieces of inside information from sources he can clearly trace to the inner sanctum of Blizzard development, otherwise he wouldn't have posted the article. When Woodward and Bernstein received their anonymous tipoff from Deep Throat about the break-ins at the Watergate building are you suggesting they should have said 'Well, we can't name our sources in public, so this clearly isn't news and we shouldn't report on it'? Seriously, how fucking stupid are you? News doesn't cease to be news because you can't name and publish your sources, can you attempt to get that through your thick head?</div></div><hr />

And about disclosing sources in a case like this, whoever keeps &quot;demanding&quot; that has no clue to what real life is because they:<br />
1. are playng this game far too much and are torn from reality<br />
or<br />
2. you are far too young to understand how the real world works.<br />

He posted what he believes to be true. That's the best anybody can do. Nothing is guaranteed until it's in the game even when Blizzard says they want to implement it (dance studios, etc).<br />

We don't necessarily want druids to be very tanky in all forms. You already get passive defenses in bear, moonkin, tree and to a lesser extent, cat. We want shifting to caster / travel to be a slight risk. It should be a decision you make based on the situation and not an automatic response. More below. <br />

Only if he's wrong.<br />

If he actually has an inside source, and the information is really real, then this has nothing in common with Bat Boy.<br />
<br />
He's either right or wrong. If he's right, he'd better not reveal his sources, or they'll get in trouble and the flow of information will stop. But if he's wrong, well, the site is going to lose a lot of credibility unless he at that time reveals his sources and the reason he believed 'em.<br />

Not for any spiteful reasons, I just do not care for some of the huge shifts. I've been playing since original release and I -like- my world the way it is. I do not mind things not seeming all that different in places Ive done all the quests for because ive moved on to the the next area, I only go back to help guildies leveling or for random achievements. How can I go help someone in 1k needles if I&quot;m phased to the new giant swimming pool?<br />
<br />
Now I realize that most of the reason I would go back to help people's alts etc were if they were being ganked by higher levels and that the phasing will affect them as well, but it won't stop everyone. Not to mention it hurts me farming for, lets say, the new deviate hatchling in WC if all of a sudden its either no longer accessible or level 80ish.<br />
<br />
I've liked every expansion so far but I don't know about this one, too much change can be a bad thing. The Lore-related shockers bother me too. I follow the lore as much as I can, but staple characters in game have such huge sudden shifts is reminding me of that season of Heroes - Villains. Thrall leaving the Horde to Garrosh, and the Horde letting him get away with killing Cairne? I can't see in what way this is good or acceptable : /<br />
<br />
With the amount of people who play there will always be those who like any given change and those who don't. I personally do not like Garrosh, even Grom had some sense in him by the time Thrall met him. I have a hard enoughtime explaining to non-horde that we are not &quot;evil&quot; or &quot;the bad guys&quot; this all will just make it that much harder.<br />
<br />
I don't really care about all this source business, I just hope these changes are mostly false for my sake. I don't like them : (</div></div><hr />

That's what has me worried - he is usually right, and these are the most awful story notes ever. It's like <br />
<br />
* In TBC, we take a big dump on lore and give you space ships and horde light bringers.<br />
* In WOTLK, we get back to our gothic fantasy roots and while homogenizing and casual-ifying everything you still get some of that old Blizz hotness (can you tell I like this patch better lol)<br />
* In CAT, we realize we're running out of the usefulness of WoW so we're cashing in on anything we've been holding out on -- be it PVP restrictions, race rstrictions, faction restrictions, mount restrictions, hell, just send us an extra $50 and you can float lasers downstream. (NOTE: I am TOTAL CAREBEAR CASUAL, I *LIKE* the new conquest system) it's just... Tauren Priests?? Worgens as a playable race?? Orgrimmar fubar???<br />

<br />
I actually don't care about any of them as long as they work in with some story. Though my prob is I already play the existing classes I enjoy and don't personally care for the rest so I won't level a new one.

Have Boub been proven wrong already , did i miss the info where someone said ha ha , Boub was wrong , this is how it will be ? If you wanna lose respect and stuff , do it when yo can clearly say that anything Boub stated was wrong. Also it says right there on the front page , that it is not 100% confirmed.<br />
<br />
My stance on it all , it's an interesting read , i personally would welcome all of the stuff in there. Really.. But , since nothing is really revealed from Blizzard in an official way (aka Blizzcon , or a post on worldofwarcraft.com) i take all of this with a grain of salt , if Boub is wrong , so what , if he is right , cool...

I can see where some of their sense of trust might be threatened. It's not trust in regards to right or wrong, it's trust in consistent behavior. This site seems to predominately stick to things that are newly released facts. A lot of people take comfort in this predictability. The more recent posts stray from that norm. maybe bot to Bb himself, as he may have his facts, but perceptually to many others this seems to very different from the usual. It's a matter of perspective.</div></div><hr />

Exactly. I don't believe Boub is doing this for publicity or any stupid evil conspiracy theory that many users have concocted. I don't doubt that he believes his sources are reliable. The problem is, we can't confirm nor invalidate these sources by our own investigation. My opinion on the whole matter is, the front page news seems more fit for a forum discussion post, rather than front page news.</div></div><hr />

Blizzcon is this weekend and we can finally figure out if it's true or not. And in the end, all the outrageous things about lore will either be denied or given good reason.

In the ashbringer comic, there is a troll paladin who explains that the Light gives its power to those who seek it. So technically any race can be a paladin.</div></div><hr />

Looks like someone copy pasted their WotLK beta e-mail and changed various words to fit with this alleged information currently available, such as the rumoured expansion name or leaving out bits stating as 'edited'. Also 'the Cataclysm zone' is such a broad wording.<br />

And yes, I compared it next to my own WotLK beta mail. Nearly every word/sentence is identical.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ent0mbed</div><div class="date">2009-08-17, 09:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Eventually Blizzard was going to catch up with the &quot;state of things&quot; as far as lore goes (i.e. where things left off in Warcraft 3). So now that they've gotten there they are going to begin putting together some new stuff. Instead of repeating history we will start to experience brand new stuff. I think people who are lore crazy just get scared at that point. At the end of the day it's Blizzard's game and lore to do with as they choose.<br />
<br />
Personally... Blizz has a track record that has kept me entertained for many, many years and I'm really looking forward to what they release next (whether the items in Boub's post are accurate or they're something completely different).<br />
<br />
I always welcome new race/class combos to keep things interesting as I love making alts. I really look forward to seeing what they manage to do with their phasing technology in the next xpac. It could potentially give the game that &quot;epic&quot; feeling again if things like Orgrimmar were in flames and leadership changes occurred... but only for those players that have completed certain quest chains.<br />
<br />
I personally don't want to see the old world altered for lower level players, but if it happens I'll roll with it and see where things take us. Either way... I'm sure it will be exciting.</div></div><hr />

You say you have sources for this information, so then give us the sources if you want your information to be believable.<br />
There seems to be a complete lack of understanding about what credability means, and for a site as well-looked as this one, I would've thought that there was a lot more forethought to the news posts then has been displayed as of late.<br />
<br />
31 bosses in Icecrown, anyone?<br />
<br />
I also get my signature image changed to &quot;Read the signature rules&quot;, and you ban people for their bad attitude? Come on. Consistensy anyone?<br />
<br />
I can't barely wait these four days, just to point and have the greatest laugh of my life at the expense of Bouboullie.<br />
<br />
I'd tell you to use your brain but it's fairly obvious you only have one in the very rudimentary &quot;must keep breathing...must post rubbish...repeat&quot; manner. Smart journalists don't reveal the source of a leak unless the source agrees to it because i) of the recriminations that the source might suffer; ii) no other insider will ever trust them with juicy gossip ever again.<br />
<br />
You're out the loop. Cry more and get the hell used to it because BB isn't going to tell you jack about his sources and quite right too. Oh and as for taking him to task over the 31 bosses thing, one of the game's lead designers casually dropped it in a post about tanking and, as is so often the case, his sarcasm didn't translate to well across the internet. Big deal, it was news from the horse's mouth and worth drawing attention to, even if it was clarified to be an exaggeration on GC's part in the end. You want to look at the WotLK leaks BB posted, they were full of the exact same &quot;THAT CAN'T POSSIBLY BE TRUE&quot; nonsense you and your retarded ilk have been hyperventilating about for the last few days and low and behold...it was.<br />
<br />
Finally, to clear up the Something Awful portion of all this - the poster whose information BB used to corroborate/'confirm' what he had already been told by his source is a WoW Insider writer and former Blizzard employee who it is more than reasonable to assume has people in the know (that's naughty Blizzard workers for those of you slow on the uptake) providing him with this stuff. We're not talking about RandomInterwebsPoster123 pulling any old thing out of his ass, we're talking about a web journo and ex-Blizzard employee who just happens to post on Something Awful as well.<br />
<br />
But hey, go on disbelieving BB if you like. Just make sure you apologise to him on Friday when it turns out 90% of what he's said turns out to be true. It's credibility, by the way, something you lack entirely.<br />
<br />
BB - keep fighting the good fight, old chap. Don't let the buggers get you down.</div></div><hr />

For the moment it's just a pre-Blizzcon leak, we have them each year and you should be used to it by now.<br />
<br />
There are vast differences between this 'leak' and the leaks for WotLK and tBC. VAST differences. One being that most of the leaks could be seen by a large portion of the player base. Your 'leaks' are from what you 'gathered.' So no, this kind of leak isn't something people are used to. Again, I feel this is you posting hype crap to draw in readers, nothing new for a news site, but sad none the less.<br />

Personally whether you're right or wrong it was a good read and entertaining just for that. If you're wrong, well it's not like you stole my left testicle before making me read it and I'm still going to come to the site. ;D<br />
<br />
Oh and for all the people arguing against the changes because it doesn't fit the 'lore'. Well, head over to the dictionary websites and research 'lore'. Hate to break it to you, but the lore is not the law.<br />
<br />
Personally I'd rather be playing in a dynamic world where the races can adjust to different religions and lifestyles. Rather than some 2nd edition D&amp;D world where for no good reason whatsoever races were pigeonholed into a set lifestyle that none of them could ever deviate from.</div></div><hr />

We don't mind some variation depending on the specific situation, but paladin OTs were accidentally pulling off of MTs an awful lot. That isn't a L2P issue. That's just the numbers being off and frustrating everyone.<br />
<br />
One of the blue posts - this is something I really dislike. Paladin OT's accidentally pulling threat of the MT? Not a l2p issue? Come on!<br />
Blizzard has a history of responding to something the community (or majority of it) never asked, pretending they are addressing an issue we were massively complaining about.<br />
<br />
How can you possibly &quot;accidentally pull&quot; threat off the MT...? Let's start with you will have to be attacking the same target as the MT, you need to have Righteous Fury on, you will probably even need to taunt it off because if you just go and do your high-threat rotation you will be OOM in a matter of seconds because nothing is hitting you (yet). If you manage to pull this off, that isn't a L2P issue, it's a very serious retardation issue.<br />
<br />
Numbers being off frustrating everyone... right. We're just gonna have more people yell at the warlocks and whatnot for not watching Omen intensively enough.</div></div><hr />

All of them coming with amazing news of future WoW expansions, very creative to say the least, but pure bullshit at the end of the day.<br />
<br />
People inside or related to development teams sign long-term NDAs with Blizzard to keep whatever the company is working on, or will work in the future, as trade secrets for years, even if the cited employee leaves the company for whatever the reason to leave is. So, even former Blizzard employees are still bound to NDAs for years.<br />
<br />
If all this information is true, then someone broke his NDA and will be most likely sued by Blizzard. Then, everything posted so far related to &quot;Cataclysm&quot; will be deleted as Cease and Desist letters arrive to every fansite administrator's mailbox.<br />
<br />
Both his community name and real name are a matter of record so while it would be easy to doubt him and call him out if he were anonymous SAGuy99, that's not the case at all, he isn't posting behind a cloak of anonymity. As for the NDA, he has mentioned on numerous occasions that he knew absolutely nothing about the next (this) expansion when he left Blizzard and that as such, believes his NDA doesn't/shouldn't affect his ability to comment on this or future expansions as he's not revealing anything he was ever privvy to. All his (and BB's) information comes from sources, who yes, are breaking their NDAs but it's up to Blizzard to track down and take action against the internal source of the leaks if they are really bothered about it (after all, who's to say such leaks aren't part of a plan to whip up anticipation to frenzy levels?)</div></div><hr />
