Patch 4.0.6 Hotfixes and 4.0.6a Changes - Feb. 11 (Updated)<br />
The list of hotfixes for today has been updated once again, new changes are in light blue. <br />
Here you'll find a list of hotfixes that address various issues related to the recently released World of Warcraft: Cataclysm patch 4.0.6. Hotfixes are updates we make on our end without requiring you to download a new patch. Some of the hotfixes below will go live the moment they are implemented, while others may require your realm to be restarted to go into effect. Please keep in mind that some issues cannot be addressed without a client-side patch update. We will continue to update this thread in the days ahead as additional hotfixes are applied. Visit our Bug Report forum for a list of 4.0.6 known issues.<br />
<br />
February 11 (Patch 4.0.6a)<br />
<br />
General<br />
<br />
Players are no longer encountering errors when having their items bid on in the Auction House. The Auctions tab also updates appropriately reflecting the bid.<br />
The South Island Iced Tea recipe no longer awards credit toward the Set the Oven to &quot;Cataclysmic&quot; or Time To Open A Restaurant guild achievements.<br />
Players can now Ignore other characters from different realms or battlegroups when queuing for Battlegrounds or dungeons using the command: /ignore playername-servername(region). Note that the user interface Ignore function and &quot;/ignore playername&quot; command still do not work correctly for players on different battlegroups and will require a future patch to correct.<br />
Releasing one's spirit after dying while on a transport or in a vehicle should no longer cause the player to disconnect.<br />
<br />
<br />
Classes<br />
<br />
Area-of-effect abilities such as Consecration (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/26573/consecration/), Efflorescence (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/81275/efflorescence/), Healing Rain (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/73920/healing-rain/), Holy Word: Sanctuary (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/88667/holy-word-sanctuary/), Ring of Frost (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/82691/ring-of-frost/), and Smoke Bomb (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/76577/smoke-bomb/) now function correctly when cast on any trapdoors (ala Cho'gall) or transports even while the caster is not standing on one of those same objects.<br />
<br />

<br />
Death's Advance (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/96270/deaths-advance/) may now not allow movement-impairing effects to reduce the death knight below 60/75% of normal movement speed, down from 75/100%.<br />
Death and Decay (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/43265/death-and-decay/) no longer damages the death knight's currently selected friendly target when it does damage to nearby target dummies.<br />
<br />
<br />

Starfall (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/48505/starfall/) no longer exceeds 20 stars within its duration.<br />
Moonfury (Balance druid passive) now increases Arcane and Nature damage by 10%, down from 15%. More information can be found here (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/157908/incoming-hotfixes).<br />
Mangle (Bear) (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/33878/mangle/) and Maul (Bear) (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/6807/maul/) damage has been increased by approximately 10%.<br />
Frost Nova (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/122/frost-nova/), Tranquility (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/740/tranquility/), War Stomp (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/20549/war-stomp/), and Starfire (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/2912/starfire/) are all properly scaled when used by or on a druid in Tree of Life form (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/65139/tree-of-life/). The previous temporary hotfix which removed the ability to use War Stomp while in Tree of Life form has been reverted.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Auto Shot (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/75/auto-shot/) was not firing while the hunter was moving under certain conditions. Auto Shot should now always function correctly while the hunter is moving.<br />
Having a melee weapon equipped no longer causes the tooltips for Cobra Shot (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/77767/cobra-shot/) and Steady Shot (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/56641/steady-shot/) to incorrectly display extra benefit from haste.<br />

The Warp Stalker ability Time Warp (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/35346/time-warp/) can no longer be used on paladins with the Divine Shield (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/642/divine-shield/) buff active.<br />

<br />
The Quad Core (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/70747/quad-core/) buff provided by the Sanctified Bloodmage 4-piece set bonus is now properly removed as soon as a spell is cast if the mage does not have 4 pieces of the set equipped.<br />

<br />
Beacon of Light no longer triggers from Light of Dawn.<br />
Glyph of Dazing Shield (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/59560/glyph-of-dazing-shield/) correctly causes Avenger's Shield (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/31935/avengers-shield/) to daze the target, and only allows Avenger's Shield to trigger the dazed effect.<br />
The area-of-effect attack of Hammer of the Righteous (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/53595/hammer-of-the-righteous/) no longer has a chance to miss secondary targets when the primary attack hits the paladin's target. If the primary attack of Hammer of the Righteous fails to hit the target due to miss/dodge/parry/block, no enemies will be affected by the area-of-effect attack. Rogues who are under Cloak of Shadows (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/31224/cloak-of-shadows/), however, are able to resist this damage.<br />
The Warp Stalker ability Time Warp (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/35346/time-warp/) can no longer be used on paladins with the Divine Shield (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/642/divine-shield/) buff active.<br />

<br />
Inner Focus (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/89485/inner-focus/) can no longer be cast before the effect of its preceding spell completes (Inner Focus will only be applied to spells that are cast after it).<br />
Shadow Power (Shadow priest passive) now increases Shadow damage by 15%, down from 25%. More information can be found here (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/157908/incoming-hotfixes).<br />
Sin and Punishment (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/87100/sin-and-punishment/) now works properly when two players of the same faction are fighting each other (including in Arenas). A string error may appear when the opponent is feared even though the talent functions correctly.<br />

<br />
Combat Readiness now triggers from all ranged attacks.<br />
Gouge (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/1776/gouge/) is now breaking properly from spell and ability damage.<br />

<br />
Raging Blow has been reduced from 120% to 100% weapon damage at max level. More information can be found here (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/157908/incoming-hotfixes).<br />
<br />
<br />
Dungeons &amp; Raids<br />
Bastion of Twilight<br />
<br />
The Elementium Monstrosity's health now more accurately reflects the state of the individual Ascendants.<br />
<br />
<br />
Blackwing Descent<br />
<br />
Drakeadon Mongrels can now be taunted.<br />
The debuff from Pyreclaw's Flame Buffet now only lasts 8 seconds.<br />
The Golem Sentry's (http://www.wowpedia.org/Golem_Sentry) Flash Bomb damage has been reduced in the 25-player version.<br />
The health of Drakeadon Mongrels and Drakonid Slayers has been reduced in 10- and 25-player versions.<br />
Nefarian's (http://www.wowpedia.org/Nefarian_(Blackwing_Descent_tactics)) Blazing Inferno (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/76195/blazing-inferno/) damage and knockdown radius has been reduced to match the spell effect graphic.<br />
<br />
<br />
Items<br />
<br />
Some Vicious Gladiator's weapons (item level 359) incorrectly had their costs increased. This has been corrected. Two-hand and ranged weapons now cost 3400 Conquest Points, while one-hand and caster weapons now cost 2450 Conquest Points.<br />
All Vicious Gladiator's weapons (item level 372) have been temporarily removed from the Glorious Conquest Quartermasters until the time is right to officially introduce them into Azerothian society.<br />
<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
<br />
Many items incorrectly rendered unusable in rated Battlegrounds and Arenas have been made usable again.<br />
<br />
<br />
Battlegrounds<br />
<br />
Players should no longer sometimes gets stuck in the world and unable to login upon completing a rated Battleground.<br />
Under certain conditions after queuing for Battlegrounds, players were still able to enter the Dungeon Finder queue. While this made it appear as though players were not actually queued properly for Battlegrounds, that wasn't the case. This issue has been fixed so that players cannot queue for both Battlegrounds and via the Dungeon Finder under these select circumstances.<br />
<br />
<br />
Battle for Gilneas<br />
<br />
The banners at each capture point now take 8 seconds to capture, up from 5. Note that when the banners are neutral and have not yet been captured by either faction at the start of a battle, they will display the wrong location names (Mine says Farm, Waterworks says Blacksmith, and Lighthouse says Stables).<br />
<br />
<br />
Races<br />
<br />
Gift of the Naaru (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/59544/gift-of-the-naaru/) now has a maximum limit to the amount healed when used on friendly NPCs with large amounts of health.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The Exalted Title<br />
Recently we changed 'the Exalted' title to require 50 exalted titles up from 40, which meant those that had achieved it were now asked to get 10 more reputations to gain the title back. We felt this kept the title as a difficult reward given the additional reputations introduced with Cataclysm, and also avoided the problem of achievement inflation as the game continues to grow, devaluing the reward.<br />
<br />
We didn’t let people know beforehand that we were making this change. A pretty cut and dry error on our part. We take full responsibility for not communicating the change properly, and apologize for the frustration it added to the situation. Unfortunately, that frustration in some people’s cases went to an extreme. Over the past couple days we’ve handed out innumerable suspensions to people who were unable to stay within the forum code of conduct while posting about this change. We of course understand passions can run hot, but some of the violations were extreme enough to remove people’s posting privileges permanently. It’s unfortunate because rational, calm, and constructive posting is the type of feedback that’s taken, discussed, and can help encourage real change. For those that were able to adhere to those posting ideals, we truly thank you for your efforts in keeping your cool.<br />
<br />
We took your constructive posts and points, and after discussing the change for quite a while with the designers, the decision has been made to move ‘the Exalted’ title back to require 40 exalted reputations. We’re going to attempt this change with a hotfix, but are unsure at this time if it will be able to be applied through a hotfix. It’s possible that a client patch will be required. (We’ll let you know if it does.)<br />
<br />
The 45 and 50 exalted reputation achievements will continue to exist, but for the time being won’t provide anything beyond achievement points. As some have questioned why the title isn’t grandfathered like ‘the Loremaster’ or ‘the Explorer’ titles, these function differently mechanically. While their requirements have changed, the actual achievement is the same. There’s no tech currently that allows us to give a title for an achievement and then move that title to a different achievement altogether and have people keep them. We are however working on such a technology that will allow players to keep items or titles associated with achievements even if we decide to change that criteria. So, say if we eventually decide to move ‘the Exalted’ title to an achievement which requires 60 reputations in the next expansion (just as an example), players who already earned the title at 40 reputations will get to keep the title when the criteria changes. This technology would allow us to let players keep titles or items they’ve already earned, while ensuring we don’t get stuck in a position where we have to continually generate new rewards just so those who earned them originally don’t lose them.<br />
<br />
Thanks again for your feedback.<br />
<br />
<br />
Incoming Hotfixes (Updated)<br />
We’re in the process of planning for a number of hotfixes that are intended to be implemented within the next day or two. To help give some heads up notice we’re currently looking to make the following changes:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ipriests.gif Shadow Power (Shadow priest passive) is being changed from 25% to 15% of Shadow damage.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/idruids.gif Moonfury (Balance druid passive) is being changed from 15% to 6% Arcane and Nature damage.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/iwarriors.gif Raging Blow reduced from 120% to 100% weapon damage at max level.<br />
<br />
<br />
In all three cases we’ve been closely monitoring performance since the patch and all 3 specs are currently doing too much damage in PvE. In the case of Shadow and Fury we were also worried about their PvP burst potential, but didn’t want to risk affecting them in PvE. Now that we have concluded they are too high in PvE, both aspects of the game should feel more balanced.<br />
<br />
We are also looking at nerfing Aimed Shot, but compensating hunters through Aspect of the Hawk. We are also likely to lower Arcane mage mana cost in some way, which will in turn buff their dps. These don’t have those specifics just yet, but do keep an eye on the 4.0.6 hotfix blog for these and other changes as they come through.<br />
<br />
<br />
Blue Posts<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ideathknights.gif Death Knight (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/269-Death-Knight) / Cataclysm Talent Calculator (http://www.wowtal.com/#k=..deathknight) / Skills/Talents (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/1116-Death-Knight-Cataclysm))<br />
Chillbains &amp; Diminishing Returns / Frost Spec<br />
The root from the Chilblains talent being exempt from diminishing returns was a bug, which was resolved. In situations where shared diminishing returns are an issue, there are other tools available to Frost specced death knights to apply snares or otherwise close the gap. We think that death knight PvP mobility is in a good place now, but we're paying close attention.<br />
<br />
We're also keeping a close eye on Frost single target dps at the moment. On a related note, it looks like Frost area of effect output is competitive, despite the changes to Howling Blast. We're also pretty happy with the layout of the Frost tree in general. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/157847/proposed-dk-changes))</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sorry man, but paladins have you beat by a wide margin. Starfall is far from useless. It might take a little thought in HOW to use it, but it's still far from useless. <br />
<br />
Anyone complaining about the warrior stuff is just a scrub that got by on playing an op fotm spec. Warriors that have been around for awhile are still going to do great. <br />
<br />
Now if they could just do something to fix healers in pvp WITHOUT gimping them in pve that would be nice.<br />
<br />
People don't really understand that blizz has painted themselves into a corner. Because of power creep you need more damage, and more healing in pve. The problem is that players don't have the same health as raid bosses. Resilience was supposed to be the fix, the problem there is if you get a healer/some casters/some melee stacking it they become walking gods. Honestly I don't think they know what to do now. They really only have two choices. Make different spell effects based on pvp/pve, or change pvp armor around so that resilience is different on different armor. That allows them to change survivability in pve not with skill/talents/mastery but instead tweak it directly.</div></div><hr />

&quot;pierces through absorption effects.&quot; - Still has a use. Although a PvP oriented one, it's still a use.<br />
<br />
LoD has directional requirements, mid range(30 yards), and heals for nothing.<br />
Earthquake is channeled, easily interrupt able in PvP (if anyone even attempted at a RNG knockdown), and does low damage.</div></div><hr />

<br />
but didn't blizz explicitly state that having LoD transfer to beacon was intended? afaik LoD was pretty OP when cata launched, and transferring through beacon too... i was in a hc dungeon when the LoD/ToR nerf hotfix was applied, and holy palas just didn't seem that good anymore. but ppl learned to cope, especially since LoD apparently was supposed to transfer via beacon.<br />
<br />
now this... this i fear will label holypalas as single target healers. HR heals for squat, LoD heals for squat.<br />
<br />
instead of nerfing this spec to the ground, i think blizz should spend a little time focusing on the other healing specs. divine hymn and hymn of hope are _channeled_, and thus aren't any good, priest regen has been a problem, archangel can't be used with holy unless you take time out from healing to smite, which is bad, the resto sham mastery ain't that good tbh, and the list goes on.<br />
<br />
i was thinking, isn't it better to make 4 other healing specs happy by buffing them than to continuously make 1 spec unhappy through nerfs?</div></div><hr />

There, fix'd it for you.<br />
<br />
<br />
The Exalted Title:<br />
Weak. The new change should have stayed. Serious players have the 50. Others should work towards it or consider another game.<br />
<br />
Why? What changes having obtained 40 reputations from 50 reputations? I grinded my ass to obtain 40 reputations, and then Cataclysm ones were easy as hell, i'm proud of having the 40 hard ones, instead of the lame ones from Cataclysm (put tabard on, run HC's till you fall asleep and ding exalted 999, took me a month and 2 days to get every Cataclysm reputation to exalted).<br />
<br />
Following that logic, every other title should have been changed:<br />
<br />
The Explorer - More zones to explore, make people explore everything again.<br />
Loremaster/The Seeker - Revamped quests, make people do everything again.<br />
Battlemaster - New BG's with more achievements, make people obtain the new ones and THEN reward Battlemaster.<br />
<br />
Correct me if i'm wrong?</div></div><hr />

Loremaster did have its requirements changed, from a number per continent to individual zone achievements.<br />

It also had Loremaster of Cataclysm added to the requirements, but if you earned it before Cata you kept the title...</div></div><hr />

<br />
You know that Beacon of Light still work with Protector of the innocent , right ? You still got some extra healing by putting it on the tank , it let you make some raid assist when someone got a really low life and is about to die (where all the HoT are worthless) without losing your tank , and you can still heal a MT and a OT very well , if you just know who's gonna take more damage .<br />
<br />
Also , the change with LoD does not affect me , because i'm wasn't using it since cata launch (when they switch it from a CD ability to a HP one) . It was only useful in 25-man because of the targeting component , and i'm not doing these so basically , i've got no use of it .<br />
<br />
And for everyone who's QQ about Paladin reverting as single MT healer : That was already the case . We never been raid Healers , and we'll never be Raid Healers . Personally , i've stayed as a MT Healer , and i'm fine now .</div></div><hr />

the thing is, it was nice to have another spell to work with and to have the ability to help with raid healing outside of HR while still doing our tank healing. we weren't locked completely into the role of using single target heals over and over for the entire fight. the idea of LoD + beacon was fun, at least for me. :/<br />

this, too. i'm perfectly capable of adapting, and have done so with every change so far... but after a while it just starts to suck a lot of the fun out of playing the class. i'm sure a lot of other paladins, or classes in general, would agree.</div></div><hr />

Sure but if you want to heal raid , roll a shamy/priest/druid . Paladin is for healing Tanks . It's why they got Plate armor as a healer .<br />
<br />
Ask a Druid to heal tank . He can't do that . So Blizz needed a Healer class who can't heal the Raid . Paladin are here . The whole &quot;we want you to choose between raid Healing and Tank Healing&quot; is crap . The only one who can choose is the priest .</div></div><hr />

I would prefer that they research what they plan to do, test it internally for a couple months, then put it out on the PTR for public testing for almost 2 months, adjust it AGAIN before release, and NOT change it less than 48 hours after release. That screams that they don't know what they are doing when it comes to balancing and/or tuning class abilities.</div></div><hr />

4.0.6 = 15% = 133% ish according too blizzard :)<br />
4.0.6a = 10= 88,67% Boink!!!!<br />
so in the end we went from a small but much needed buff too a stat which was bottom of the priorities, putting it still miles behind on haste but slightly above crit just too put it below his orginal value.<br />
can't blizzard remove mastery from leather entirely neither moonkins or trees (resto) want the stat now that it's useless again.<br />
or just get it out of the game completly. apparantly they can't predict how it's gonna working. they can't even see how terrible it is atm.<br />

<br />
That's wrong how blizzard cooks. It's more like:<br />
Dev 1 - This is too sweet we need to do something about it.<br />
Dev 2 - Let's put in less sugar<br />
Dev 2 - Ok that should work..<br />
Dev 1 - Wait, make sure to put in a load of salt too.<br />
Dev 2 - But I think less sugar got it done?<br />
Dev 1 aka Ghost Crawler - You question Greg Street?!<br />
Dev 2 - Sorry your majesty, it will be done.<br />
<br />
I mean, look at DK's for one example. Within 24-hours:<br />
- Massive DPS nerf to PVE (which hurt PVP)<br />
- Piled on yet another hefty DPS nerf to make sure to knock them to last on the meters in every fight in raids, plus they can't kill something in PVP<br />
- Nerfed their added mobility, which was part of the reason they nerfed their damage, was for the added mobility.<br />
<br />
Now the class is sitting there BROKEN and USELESS in both PVP and PVE DPS. Auto-renewal is off, I'm done with this game anymore. They go too far everytime breaking a class in 24-hours, and they won't fix them for 6 months. I'm not going to sit there and bring down my guild's progression now. I'm not going to sit there and get laughed at in PVP because we're in worse shape now than in later Wrath seasons, and CoI is a joke on top of what it was back then.<br />
<br />
They need to get their A-team back on this game to save it before it collapses into itself. It's heading that way FAST too. These latest changes to characters are out of control. Yet they'll continue to leave certain classes as OP with a blind eye. Then they'll buff the heck out of another and leave them OP for a while. Then they nerf another class into oblivion, and don't care. And balancing problems are just ONE of the FEW MAJOR PROBLEMS within the game right now.</div></div><hr />

4.0.6 = 15% = 133% ish according too blizzard :)<br />
4.0.6a = 10= 88,67% Boink!!!!<br />
so in the end we went from a small but much needed buff too a stat which was bottom of the priorities, putting it still miles behind on haste but slightly above crit just too put it below his orginal value.<br />
can't blizzard remove mastery from leather entirely neither moonkins or trees (resto) want the stat now that it's useless again.<br />
or just get it out of the game completly. apparantly they can't predict how it's gonna working. they can't even see how terrible it is atm.<br />
it causes problems all over the place.<br />
<br />
sorry what are you yapping on about? they didn't nerf moonkin mastery. they nerfed the arcane/nature damage passive.<br />
<br />
do you even read or are you so desperate to vent yourself that you fail to read properly?<br />

That's wrong how blizzard cooks. It's more like:<br />
Dev 1 - This is too sweet we need to do something about it.<br />
Dev 2 - Let's put in less sugar<br />
Dev 2 - Ok that should work..<br />
Dev 1 - Wait, make sure to put in a load of salt too.<br />
Dev 2 - But I think less sugar got it done?<br />
Dev 1 aka Ghost Crawler - You question Greg Street?!<br />
Dev 2 - Sorry your majesty, it will be done.<br />
<br />
I mean, look at DK's for one example. Within 24-hours:<br />
- Massive DPS nerf to PVE (which hurt PVP)<br />
- Piled on yet another hefty DPS nerf to make sure to knock them to last on the meters in every fight in raids, plus they can't kill something in PVP<br />
- Nerfed their added mobility, which was part of the reason they nerfed their damage, was for the added mobility.<br />
<br />
Now the class is sitting there BROKEN and USELESS in both PVP and PVE DPS. Auto-renewal is off, I'm done with this game anymore. They go too far everytime breaking a class in 24-hours, and they won't fix them for 6 months. I'm not going to sit there and bring down my guild's progression now. I'm not going to sit there and get laughed at in PVP because we're in worse shape now than in later Wrath seasons, and CoI is a joke on top of what it was back then.<br />
<br />
They need to get their A-team back on this game to save it before it collapses into itself. It's heading that way FAST too. These latest changes to characters are out of control. Yet they'll continue to leave certain classes as OP with a blind eye. Then they'll buff the heck out of another and leave them OP for a while. Then they nerf another class into oblivion, and don't care. And balancing problems are just ONE of the FEW MAJOR PROBLEMS within the game right now.<br />
<br />
are we even playing the same game? last i checked DK's are fine. Everyone thinks the sky is falling for their own class it seems - even when it's actually not.</div></div><hr />

<br />
guess i missunderstood. the change guess the mastery buff remains the 3% dps increase it was.<br />
and they now nerf overall damage by 5%<br />
so guess we are going back 2% overall. result is the same we are below elemental shamans. and we are equal too feral druids.<br />
and if you take into consideration we are the biggest RNG class out there. and we don't bring anything special too raids like mages, warlocks or shamans do. you can guess where 75% of the moonkins in raiding guilds end up when the raidleader has too pick between those 4</div></div><hr />

You're not playing the same game. Other classes are either OP or &quot;fine&quot; (underpowered) except if you're playing them which they can be: OP, Fine, Broken. DK's are now in current logs at the bottom of DPS meters for every fight. Both frost and unholy. A solid 5-10% nerf in overall DPS would be good, not a 20-30%, kkggthxgbye.</div></div><hr />

In all three cases we’ve been closely monitoring performance since the patch and all 3 specs are currently doing too much damage in PvE. In the case of Shadow and Fury we were also worried about their PvP burst potential, but didn’t want to risk affecting them in PvE. Now that we have concluded they are too high in PvE, both aspects of the game should feel more balanced.<br />

There is more hotfixes now because they are able to do it with their new streaming download technology, and it enables them to make much more tweaks to the game without having to wait until another major patch.<br />
<br />
It has more to do with completely disregarding PTR information and feedback and then buffing/nerfing in a heavy handed manner rather than MODERATION.<br />

<br />
Yeah Blizzard doesn't realize that DI is the reason our damage goes up to the OP levels. It took the last buff we got the other day to even begin to compete with equal geared mutilate rogues, hunters, feral druids, and warlocks without DI. All this change does is severely hurt shadow priests in 10 mans who can't always have a warlock DI butt buddy while keeping us just competitive with the buff. Why should we be nerfed around an obviously broken buff that should never have been set the way it is? Since Dark Intents inception, the playerbase warned Blizzard about the synergy and wanted them to rework the mechanic as to avoid this issue but they did not listen.<br />
<br />
This is just Burning Crusade all over again when they nerfed shadow weaving to lower warlock damage instead of fixing the heart of the problem. Yes shadow damage atm is a slight bit on the ridiculous side by nerfing our shadow damage 10% doesn't fix that DI should never have provided a 9% damage bonus to begin with to cause that problem. This is just a cheap easy solution for them but hurts the shadow players.</div></div><hr />

We went 11/12 tuesday night no problem, nefarian was the only fight i noticed mana issues, even then the only reason we didn't down him was attendance. <br />

As far as the Light of Dawn change goes, the spell was already useless anyways except during clumped up &quot;top off&quot; periods like Feud on Chimaeron. Word of Glory is a FAR better use of holy power due to Eternal Glory procs.</div></div><hr />

@Shadow Priest nerf- After doing 20k DPS last night in my mostly blues, I knew it was incoming, but so fast...I am saddened. I don't want this to be like BC where we got Shadow Weaving nerf because of $%@$ Warlocks again. Good thing I have 2 raiding Warlocks in my 10 man.<br />

i don't even have a holy pala, but i think this spec has been hit pretty hard with the nerfbat since the release of cata. mana cost increase alongside the divine plea thing, the tower of radiance (or something) nerf that won't allow HL to grant HoPo when healing the beacon.the forbearance thing i can understand to a certain degree.<br />
<br />
but didn't blizz explicitly state that having LoD transfer to beacon was intended? afaik LoD was pretty OP when cata launched, and transferring through beacon too... i was in a hc dungeon when the LoD/ToR nerf hotfix was applied, and holy palas just didn't seem that good anymore. but ppl learned to cope, especially since LoD apparently was supposed to transfer via beacon.<br />
<br />
now this... this i fear will label holypalas as single target healers. HR heals for squat, LoD heals for squat.<br />
<br />
instead of nerfing this spec to the ground, i think blizz should spend a little time focusing on the other healing specs. divine hymn and hymn of hope are _channeled_, and thus aren't any good, priest regen has been a problem, archangel can't be used with holy unless you take time out from healing to smite, which is bad, the resto sham mastery ain't that good tbh, and the list goes on.<br />
<br />
i was thinking, isn't it better to make 4 other healing specs happy by buffing them than to continuously make 1 spec unhappy through nerfs?<br />
<br />
I wonder what universe you're in. Paladin healing is still in a good place (or at least was). Divine Hymn and Hymn of Hope are are OK- or at least Divine Hymn is. It's like Tranquility, it's a powerful cooldown, it shouldn't be a cast. Archangel is really meant for Disc and Smite provides 3 times the healing of Heal...Things could be improved, but they aren't nearly as bad as you say.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Still I believe nerfing LoD to Beacon heals(-50% beacon heals might be good, or even better, add a complex formula to calculate and balance that heal) and revert the 40% nerf would've been a better choice.<br />
<br />
Word of Glory needs to stand out as a single target HP spell, while LoD should be intended for AoE heals(if you want tank healing in LoD, just make yourself in range of the tank for it). As how blizz is balancing these two spells now, there will always be one HP spell that is going to be useless.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You really should stop posting until you learn to read. First off, I am a moonkin, and we are in the top 5 in damage for almost every raid boss fight (see stateofdps). Now lets take a look at the 3 changes they have really made to us in the last round of patches and hotfixes. Remember, we are high on the damage charts, so we should see a slight nerf overall.<br />
<br />
1. They fixed a bug with Starfall that was making it create too many stars. This bug fix will be a slight nerf<br />
2. They increased the bonus from our mastery (eclipse) by 33%. This is a huge buff for people that really hit eclipse properly<br />
3. They nerfed our passive bonus for all our spells from 15% to 10%. This is obviously a 5% nerf to all our damage<br />
<br />
What this means? Mastery is a much more important stat for us now. It probably is slightly above crit, and is definitely something we shouldn´t automatically reforge like we were doing before. It also makes our ´rotation´much more important and less forgiving since a larger portion of our damage will be coming from the Mastery. You will need to time your dots and starfall correctly to get the best possible dps. If you are the type of player who spams whatever spell he wants and is happy that some of them sometimes will get the eclipse bonus, then you will be hurting.<br />
<br />
Honestly, I can tell it is a nerf overall, but I doubt it will be very much. A 33% increase to Mastery is significant and on a large amount of raid bosses, it is not very hard to control your eclipse to get the most out of it. You just have to be a smart player too. For instance on heavy movement parts of fights where you are going to moonfire spam, you have to make sure you are in eclipse (which you will be in the entire time if you only use moonfire) going into the movement phase. <br />
<br />
and, lol,... no class brings anything special. they haven´t in a long long time. If you still think you need a special ability to get into a raid group, maybe you should try a different game. We do already have one of the most unique abilities in the game with rebirth... in my opinion, we are one of the last classes that should be complaining about being ´replacable´because we do not have a unique ability. We also have Tranq, which is very useful in certain encounters.<br />

It's really gone too far with the hotfixes. Use the PTR damn it.<br />
<br />
Why wait that long? They have the data coming in non-stop. All of the fan websites agree about who the best DPS are at the moment (unholy, shadow, moonkin).. why in the world would Blizzard put it on the PTR and wait a month to balance things in the real game. These are all very basic damage adjustments that will simply bring DPS in line... again, they have thier own data which is probably collected every night, and there are multiple fansites that gather large amounts of data. If on every fight, shadow priests are the #1 damage dealer by 10%, why put a 10% flat nerf on the PTR for a month?... just put it in the game... and if you have to adjust it a little later, do it. None of these changes are really game-changers for any spec ( with the exception of holy pallys). These changes just buff or nerf damage fairly predictably.. nothing that really needs to be tested. People really need to check out other websites like stateofdps too see the information the devs are reacting too.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nitrax</div><div class="date">2011-02-13, 11:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was talking about the LoD -&gt; beacon hotfix. Changing some % here and there is ok to hotfix because it dont risk breaking other stuff on the way (its just a number). Changing core spells that affect how you play the game should not be hotfixed. I remember when they removed the ability for Holy Light to proc holy power I spent some time rebooting and what not because I thought my game was broken.<br />
<br />
It feels very random, no communication etc.<br />
<br />
Edit: I don't care when they change DPS.. dps is just dps, if you get lower dps you just have to try harder be quicker on the boss, dont eat while playing. But when they change the healing game it adds stress and it may result in wipes. I'm talking about &quot;mid range&quot; raiding ofc on hardcore levels a slight change in dps can mean the difference between wipe and win. I've played DPS and it's the easiest thing in the world if you compare to healing (talking about PvE ofc).<br />
<br />
I remember when we started halfus, if heroism came too late or I missed ONE gcd of tank healing it was a wipe. So please dont mess with healers we have it hard enough as it is.</div></div><hr />
