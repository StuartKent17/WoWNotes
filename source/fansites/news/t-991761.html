now za/zg will be faster than the cata heroics ;/<br />
<br />
Yet, you're dealing with slowly outdated gear and points that doesn't buy you main pieces of your gear. Aside from going to the other heroics, seems reasonable to me.</div></div><hr />

I think there more inclined to be there just for the valor points. 150 x 7 a week on the PTR atm. That includes all cataclysm heroics..so maybe just maybe ZA/ZG will be nerfed.</div></div><hr />

Bear trash is shorter, and bear takes less time to kill IMO. I'll be going eagle bear as well.<br />

Blizzard has said on THREE DIFFERENT OCCASSIONS that they were gonna fix the floundering effect paladins have in arena after the burst wings falls off. So to do this, they are removing some dmg, and moving into two hnder spec and more Censure dmg. This will make paladins overall stronger, rather than being a glass cannon for two mins, then being train bitch when its over.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thats a freaking 50% nerf?!?! I will _CRIT_ 15k with this nerf?!?! And I'm in full 391 gear :|| The problem isn't swipes damage. It's swipes energy cost + damage versus Berserk uptime. You pop Tiger's Fury and then pop Berserk and spam Swipe for 50k dps for 25 seconds glyphed. It's too high.<br />
<br />
Besides, if you're swiping a minimum of 3 targets and critting for 15k, Cat has almost 50% crit full raid buffed, you should be swinging for 34k dps before adding in extra targets. That's right where it should be.</div></div><hr />

Argument valid if not because of the fact that we have been clearing those bosses for months now. It's not like we never did any of those bosses and their work wasn't seen and used. <br />

They acknowledged the fact that we're really sick of clearing everything and presented us an easy way out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
seriousilly, the swipe dmg was fine as it was, i used to complain a lot in wotlk that i couldnt make any decent aoe in cat form. cata brought some buffs and it made me and pretty much, im sure, all feral druids happy with their new reliable aoe dmg.<br />
<br />
yes, its been mentioned tigers fury + berserk + spam swipe gives quite a huge burst, but sometimes that burst is needed/usefull, and its balance enough that we need to use our best dps cooldown in order to make that burst. without berserk active, spaming swipe is not viable for making decent aoe dmg compared to some other classes. cant imagine how lame the dmg will be with the new nerfs. we will be making with tigers + berserk the actual dmg we are doing now without any cooldown. <br />
<br />
im unsure of what to think of this until i actualy test and see the numbers for myself, but i believe its a bit of a BIG and not so needed nerf.<br />
<br />
and god almighty dont let it be that pve was nerfed again because of pvp, i swear ill freak out. tired of pve being screwed over because of pvp/pve balance issues.</div></div><hr />

It's a powerful AoE but at the same time it's melee and a frontal cone instead of a 360° attack.The problem is it's burst AoE if you use TF/Berserk, and how much difference an omen proc does. The solution is to make it weaker but lowering the energy cost to 30-35. This way, it will take more GCDs to deal the same damage at the start, but since we'll go out of energy overall DPS for AoE phases longer then 5 sec will stay the same.</div></div><hr />

I also can say that options to &quot;Get gear set from bank&quot; and &quot;Put Gear set to bank&quot; features would be awesome.

<br />
I was wondering the same thing. I think im just dumb and I missed something. Otherwise seems really odd. Swipe was fine except when you use TF and Berserk. If I don't use Berserk I'm rarely ever doing the most AOE. Like someone said before, decreasing swipe damage and energy cost is the best way to go. Now our AOE is only really effective when using berserk. No class should rely on CDs for effective AOE.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i disagree and agree.<br />
Hammer crit reduced by 6% is a burst remover. Ret Paladins are more as Support class ( Freedoms / Sacrfise / Bubble / Glory ) and have low sustain dps, but have a high Burst Dmg, which makes them almost as fair, little bit powerful but comparing to other sustain dps he is little bit above fair.<br />
<br />
with reducing the crit chance by 54% you are removing the burst ability, which makes him unable to make a difference in the dps matter, but still making the same support to his teamates in defensive cooldowns and healing.<br />
<br />
final note, as for xxcution. paladins have a great ability, which is normal like anyother ability, but now it wont be a burst ability anymore.<br />
<br />
This change is going to Ruin the class and send him to extintion and the born of Holy paladins back.</div></div><hr />

I enjoy a mixture of bosses. A far better solution if they want to balance time per valor point, would be to put them in the same queue but have a greater valor point drop from the Troll HCs.

Yeah it sounds a bit odd to be honest altough i really like them to be faster on my main because i did them like 10000 times until now so i really just want to get trough asap. I could see this as a problem for twinks or new guys which need loot from skipped bosses BUT tbh wasn´t that already a problem back in 4.0 and 4.1 with HoR? I always wanted to do the optional bosses too but no one really wanted to to do them because they werent needed for the endboss. So this problem is not really new. OFC for timed runs or full clears you still have your guild :)</div></div><hr />

Do you really think that I remember the name of all items? Alternative to this is to highlight in the bank the item that I hover over when I press &quot;Alt&quot; while hovering over an equiped item, so that I don't waste time searching for it in the bank. I also can say that options to &quot;Get gear set from bank&quot; and &quot;Put Gear set to bank&quot; features would be awesome. Also, if this features would remember the place in the bank where I took them from, so that if I don't use a slot of those, when I put back my set in bank it will always use the same exact position.<br />
<br />
I do remember where my items are (by type) in my bags. Then they implemented feature that every bag opens up when I go to a vendor. Now I have to close all the bags I don't want to be open instead of opening just the one bag I need.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">frejborg</div><div class="date">2011-10-05, 05:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The TBC PvE progression was best, from what I can see. You geared up in heroics ONLY when you were a fresh lvl 70, and then progressed into raiding Karazhan, Gruul's, and then when you were successful there, you progressed into harder raids. You didn't have to go back to heroics grinding ridiculous amounts for each new old tier to be able to raid recent content that you never earned the place to be in, by completing easier progression content. Anyway, the Ret change seems like quite a good thing. More sustained damage and less reliance on AW(burst). Congratulations Rets. I wonder how hard your judgements hit? To me, the glory days of ret was when judgement was your hardest hitting ability, it and your rotation was ridiculously simplistic, but when you crit, it MEANT something. TBC ret paladin was so much fun for me. Alas... Wind Shear nerf is a must... Resto Shamans just have too much utility at the moment. And with this change many will still have it... I think more is in order. Very good change for Enh Shaman, you all must be happy about that iirc you guys have been wanting that change for quite some time. Demonology changes are good for the spec of course, but I am hopeful still that some more technical/utility changes will come for the spec for PvP reasons. You don't have to analyse any data to see that Demonology pvp is an unfocused spec with subpar utility/clutch abilities.</div></div><hr />

Why nerf ? yes its overpowerd in the first 5 secs of trash but keeping up with locks mages and other classes after that is impossible due to the energy cost of it. i have approx 50% crit in raid and you only use this on trash or multiple mobs but its damn pricey and no comparison to other aoe classes. only time i'm at top dps and then briefly as the mages and locks and mana classes fly past.</div></div><hr />

Am I the only one who'd rather see trash removed in favour of having a string of boss encounters that aren't skippable?<br />
<br />
Sounds like a good idea to me.<br />
<br />
One of the major Cata beta forum threads was about trash. Players suggested that instead of having a ton of trash and trying to reintroduce CC, dungeons should have very little trash, but have most of that trash be more powerful and varied - like mini-bosses. The idea was to make dungeons and heroics hard while keeping them quick (for those who know what they're doing), instead of taking the lazy &quot;lots of repetitive trash&quot; route which is not at all hard - just tedious. From the state of heroics at release, you can guess how little they listened to that input.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard really need to think through wtf they want to do with this specc ,every patch seems to be a major rework . This crit nerf needs hihger compensation than some seal buff and they will screw up again for sure and fixes coming again again and again and again. Ret is fine now the way that is and im getting tired of getting used to the new playstyles after each rework but let's see what this will bring.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure why you're complaining. ZA/ZG runs were tedious and boring after the first couple times the community ran them. By requiring only two of the bosses, Blizz (1) acknowledges that the player base, at large, out gears the instances, and (2) would rather seem them take time on par with the original heroics. I'm quite happy with this change, although I agree with another poster that TBC PvE progression was the best. I truly hate grinding heroics, though I suppose there must be something for the unwashed masses.<br />
<br />
tl:dr, its an awesome quality of life change, so stop QQing</div></div><hr />
