No BlizzCon in 2012 - Battle.net World Championship<br />
Blizzard Entertainment is proud to announce the 2012 Battle.net World Championship, a major global eSports event featuring some of the best pro-gaming competition in the world. Slated to take place in Asia toward the end of 2012, the Battle.net World Championship will host this year’s StarCraft II and World of Warcraft Arena World Championship tournaments. Blizzard gamers and eSports fans from around the world will be invited to attend and witness some of the most skilled pro players on the planet battle it out for cash and glory.<br />
<br />
We’re excited to be showcasing Blizzard eSports on a truly global stage this year. We're also heavily focused on getting Diablo III, Mists of Pandaria, and Heart of the Swarm into players’ hands as soon as possible. In light of our jam-packed schedule, we’ve decided to hold the next BlizzCon in 2013.<br />
<br />
More details about the 2012 Battle.net World Championship and BlizzCon 2013, including specific dates and locations, will be coming in the months ahead.<br />
<br />
<br />
Blizzcon 2012 Follow-up<br />
Yeah it's a bit disappointing because we all really do enjoy being able to 'open the doors' so to speak. But, it is an enormous effort by all employees, including our game designers and artists, not to mention customer support and quality assurance, PR, our business departments, and *hot breath on fingernails &amp; shirt rub* Community &amp; eSports to make a BlizzCon happen. In a year when we're working to release multiple titles (knock on wood) it makes sense to focus our efforts. Also with multiple game releases we just wonder if we'd be at a point with any of them where we'd have anything really big or new or cool to talk about.<br />
<br />
We didn't have a BlizzCon in 2006 either, and at that time we were really strong on the idea that BlizzCon isn't really supposed to be and doesn't have to be an annual event. Of course then we have it for five straight years in a row... which obviously built some expectation.<br />
<br />
Personally I always enjoy seeing the excitement, the rushing crowds, hearing the clicking of mice on the demo stations, and waiting in agony as the seconds countdown to an announcement and then the waves of emotion from the crowd that follow it. But thinking about our year and what we're trying to get done already without a BlizzCon, and having to think pretty hard about what we'd have to announce or demo, it just makes sense to me not to have one.<br />
<br />
Here's to the Battle.net World Championship, it's going to be awesome, and to a bigger and better BlizzCon in 2013. <br />

It means that Pandaria will be ut before blizzcon would have happened. Probably may-july release date.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Personally, I get the feeling they're doing this because they haven't got much significant stuff to announce and/or talk about. MoP will be out or nearly out, so there would only be little bits to talk about, HotS will probably be out, and D3 had better be out. What's left? Talking about another expansion in WoW, The last part of the SC2 trilogy and Titan. They probably wouldn't want to release anything about Titan just yet, it will be too early to talk about the next WoW expansion and stretching SC2 news over a couple of days just won't happen.<br />
<br />
Poised for some big announcements in 2013 though.</div></div><hr />

They could still announce Titan and the next WoW Xpac that way?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GrieverXIII</div><div class="date">2012-01-25, 01:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Makes sense, considering all of their current big projects are being released this year, they wouldn't had much to announce for either next wow xpack after MoP, SC2 xpack after HotS or D3 first xpack, and Titan is obviously not close enough for release (if we ever hear anything about this).</div></div><hr />

<br />
I very much doubt they'd lack content for blizzcon lol, lets hope they spend the extra time gettin MoP and D3 out asap! Cause lets be honest if they don't release mop or a new content patch for wow, they're going to lose A LOT of subs.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheEaterofSouls</div><div class="date">2012-01-25, 01:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ever think that blizzard doesnt need b lizzcon to release some of their titles. MoP, HotS, and D3 might get release before-hand.(D3 and MoP most definitly) They might even clarify this at some point. Still sad that there is no Blizzcon this year :(</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ryme</div><div class="date">2012-01-25, 01:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just generally means there's not much they either want to or have to show.

I imagine they are going to use that event to preview all of their upcoming games and content like they do Blizzcon. Grats to the Asian players on getting their own convention. Thanks for ignoring the East Coast again Blizzard. This makes me think that MoP will be out prior to Blizzcon. It just seems weird that they wouldn't have their premier event in the States when there is a major game about to launch that they would have been previewing like crazy. Post-launch Blizzcon only features upcoming content patch information so they could still do that. More fuel to fire the Panda-ering to the Asian market folks sadly.</div></div><hr />

DIII would be already out by fall 2012, there isn't much on the SC scene overall and MoP was already announced.

Lack of relevant content is precisely the reason why there won't be any Blizzcon because they wouldn't have anything to do there.</div></div><hr />

Oh well. More time to save money.<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit: Seriously though guys, Blizzcon is no small feat. It takes a boatload of work. It's probably not a light decision to not have one and instead work really hard on stuff. But I just hope we benefit from it.</div></div><hr />

There really wouldn't be much to talk about because by that time their 3 big new titles will be released or we would have already known everything about them by that time. So I expect to see some big announcements next year including Titan! :D<br />
<br />
Agreed, with their current work being released around that time (I could imagine) there'd be no big news other than potentially Titan. But we'll wait for 2013 then, surely we'll get loads of awesome stuff then. =D</div></div><hr />

Lack of relevant content is precisely the reason why there won't be any Blizzcon because they wouldn't have anything to do there.<br />

Exactly. Except MoP will have been released by then, and it'd be too early to talk about the new expansion.</div></div><hr />

This is a year that all of their major, revealed, projects are laying down the merch before Blizzcon. Remove the concert (big PR problem last year), the giant new product announcement (D3/SCII/WoW have none, Titan apparently not ready for it), and filler panels (still cool, but they are filler) and what do you have left? A couple tournaments.<br />
<br />
So I'm guessing their answer is a half-truth. Because of their busy schedule they'll have no big product to reveal this year. Without that, it is hard to justify beyond just being a large party to the share holders.</div></div><hr />

Theory time!<br />
<br />
a) you won't be playing MoP this year, thus no reason to hype it @ a convention.<br />
b) the shit-storm on the forums about MoP has died down a bit, they don't want to rekindle that so soon before release.</div></div><hr />

And I can't be arsed to care about anything esports, so the tournament doesn't interest me either.<br />
<br />
But like others have pointed out, this could be a blessing in disguise. If the fates align and we end up with D3, HotS, and MoP all this year, I'll be a happy camper. And if they did all end up releasing before when Blizzcon would have been, then we'll know it was the right decision. The only thing that really sucks about it will be that we won't get any concrete info on Titan until 2013 at the earliest.<br />
<br />
But if next year's Blizzcon has the next WoW expansion, LotV, maybe news of a D3 expansion, and Titan, I don't think anyone's eyes will be torn from their screens.</div></div><hr />

Oh, I agree. I just find their PR nonsense rather insulting - as if they expect their fans to fall for the whole &quot;oh, we're too busy making games!&quot; spiel.

Yes. There was no 2006 Blizzcon. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BlizzCon<br />

The lack of a Blizzcon doesn't mean no reveal, they have actually revealed a number of recent titles outside of the event. <br />
<br />
I would agree that it's very unlikely of a Titan reveal in a year where they are working on three primary titles though.</div></div><hr />

2012 is lining up to be one of Blizzard's busiest ever. 3 new product releases, Diablo III, Mist of Pandaria and Starcraft 2: Heart of the Swarm, All of which are highly likely to be released to market before the traditional October date for Blizzcon. On top of they if they're not ready to unveil the new MMO poject to the world, then what would they really have to talk about at Blizzcon 2012? Far better to postpone to 2013 until they have some to showcase otherwise they're just wasting money and time which could go toward product.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The faster x-pac schedule, if pulled off, makes announcing a new expansion at this Blizzcon (if one was held in 2012)... iffy. It might not go over well potentially announcing the next expansion after MOP when patch 5.1 might not even be out yet. Blizzard may not even know what they want to change yet or what works/fails of MOP that needs changed.<br />

Imagine Blizzard announcing CATA back when most average guilds were just beginning to farm KT in Naxx, and Maly/3D Sarth were progression still. Average, keyword, average.</div></div><hr />

You don't think that a ridiculous number of hours goes into creating the mega-event that is a Blizzcon? You've never been to one. It isn't an excuse, Blizzard has typically worked on a single game at a time, with a WoW expansion being hammered out in long-term segments. They are now releasing a main title, and two expansions within a rough year of each other. <br />
<br />

Blizzard are not aiming at the Asian market over Europe/North america. They make like 10-20% of there money at max from Asia and the rest from the west. It would be stupid for Blizzard to make an expansion just to cater to Asia. Assuming you were talking about MoP of course.</div></div><hr />

In order for that to happen, they would already need to be in the late alpha stage at this moment. Then they would have to start the beta process no later than the middle of February. Unfortunately, I doubt they're that far into the development cycle.<br />

Don't patronize me. I know (roughly) how much time goes into an event of that size. I also know that 95% of the dev team(s) are not involved in it in any shape or form. I also know Blizzard PR speak when I see it - this is most definitely an excuse.

If you think about it, there's no way they can do a Blizzcon as good as last year's this time around...especially on the WoW front. MoP will then have (relatively) recently been released, along with D3 and Heart of the Swarm..with people probably nagging for Titan info they can't share yet.<br />
<br />
I imagine 2012 will be great with most likely the expansion after MoP announcement, possibly D3 exp announcement and a wallop of info on SC2's last expansion. Oh and who knows maybe a Titan trailer ;)<br />
<br />
That will be my prediction for the next 2 years. I'm of course sad that there's no Blizzcon to watch on the stream but I completely agree with the decision.<br />
<br />
And yeah lol @ people who think Blizzcon is a small effort. Any event of that scale takes enormous amounts of time to plan and organize.</div></div><hr />

In order for that to happen, they would already need to be in the late alpha stage at this moment. Then they would have to start the beta process no later than the middle of February. Unfortunately, I doubt they're that far into the development cycle.<br />
<br />
Seriously, I'd be shocked and amazed if MoP releases before November. Hell, I'll be amazed if D3 releases before September.<br />
<br />
Beta doesn't need to last near as long as cata beta lasted, because there aren't thousands of quests and dozens of zones to test. I bet MoP is in alpha now, and even if beta doesnt start until march, then MoP can still release in June or July.</div></div><hr />

This means they're probably working on Diablo III, MoP, Starcraft II expacs, and Titan.<br />

I thought Blizzcon was for/about the fans and not just to pimp the latest Blizzard product? Guess this puts that notion to rest.<br />
<br />
Can't it be both?<br />
I mean come on, of course Blizzcon is always a good way to make sales, get products to the people and advertise your games, but it's still always a place for fans and developers to come together and celebrate Blizzard games. Those two things don't exclude each other. <br />
<br />
But more to the point, the reason why they aren't doing it this year, according to Blizzard, which I think some might agree is the most reliable source in this matter, is because they've got too much stuff to do. Diablo 3, Starcraft 2: Heart of the Swarm, World of Warcraft: Mists of Pandaria. So I have no problem believing that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;We seek honest feedback and use it to improve the quality of our work. At the end of the day, most players won’t remember whether the game was late -- only whether it was great.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;we’re committed to making ethical decisions, always keeping our players in mind&quot;<br />
<br />
Blizzcon is at its base, a convention all about the fans. What does it show now that Activision Blizzard has decided to skip it?<br />
<br />
Beside the fact that since Activision merged with Blizzard, the ticket price has magically gone up 75% in just a few years. While actual inflation, is about 8.5% during that same period. <br />
<br />
Perhaps they realized, that the $25 price increase each year would start pissing people off, and many less people would pay $200 for just 3 days of Blizzard's crap. <br />
<br />
Perhaps they didn't feel that running Blizzcon was as profitable as pumping out games that people have to buy. It's already well known that Diablo will have III separate games, even though they have decided not to announce that as of yet. <br />
<br />
It is time for all of you to admit, Blizzard isn't the same company they used to be. It used to be, quality over quantity. <br />
<br />
Nowadays, it's &quot;screw you&quot; over quality. They'd rather sell a few million (about 4.5 million copies of SCII as of December 2010) $60 games, than hold a convention a significantly smaller number of their fans (less than 30,000 last year) will pay them for. <br />
<br />
So, foregoing the simple math here, that is $270 million for releasing StarCraft. Or $4.55 Million for Blizzcon, which obviously costs them a lot more to produce. <br />
<br />
Since they'll be releasing the pandaria game ($40 +$80 CE) the $40 and $80 CE swarm game, and $60 and likely $100 Diablo game, they are looking at possibly $600 million or more, in profits, compared to under $10 million. If you look at the history of the ceo of activision, you will see this is a clear pattern for his games. <br />
<br />
I think it is clear to say, that Blizzard is no longer a company that is based around what it's customers needs are. Especially when they're cancelling Blizzcon just so they can rush out a few more titles before WoW is dead. <br />
<br />
R.I.P. the old Blizzard that actually gave a fuck about anything besides just making more green.</div></div><hr />

I think that MoP will be released already by time Blizzcon is typically held but, it will be much to soon to preview the next xpac. I think this is great news personally not only for WOW players but Diablo players as well.</div></div><hr />

They already lost me in WoW, and no Blizzcon means that after I get the last SC2 game they put out there won't be anything making me want to know more. Guess this means goodbye to Blizzard.

<br />
Then again, would 3 big blizzard releases in 2012 make up for it? Err, yes :P<br />
<br />
Pretty much my thoughts.<br />
<br />
There will be anti-WoW Fanboys jumping all over this, of course. &quot;LOLOL BLIZZ IS DYING&quot;. No, Blizz is busy making stuff so mindblowing that Blizzcon 2013 will probably be an absolute blast. Plus, Titan info will probably be announced then. :P<br />
<br />
<br />
Maybe BioWare should have a SWTOR-con next year instead!!! :P<br />
<br />
I thought Blizzcon was for/about the fans and not just to pimp the latest Blizzard product? Guess this puts that notion to rest.<br />
<br />
Oh look.<br />
<br />
It's pretty obvious that you don't know what goes into Blizzcon, but I'll lay it out honestly, blatantly and factually to you. Blizzcon has panels that are run by its actual gamemakers. The programmers, artists, modellers, writers, so on. These guys are exhausted at the panels. I've been to Blizzcon. I see it in their faces. The 2008 Blizzcon where Ghostcrawler made his first appearance, at the eve of the WotLK launch? He looked TERRIBLE. Like he hadn't slept in 3 weeks, because he was busy finalizing systems, posting non-stop on the WoW forums and having to set up 5 developer panels for a 2-day convention.<br />
<br />
Conventions take an insane amount of work to set up, and an even more insane amount of time. And this I can state for an absolute fact as someone who has friends who are cartoonists and attend 6 conventions a year, hosting panel discussions + whatnot... even one panel where you discuss what your job is takes an agonizing amount of time to prepare to make it professional and worth the time of the hundreds-- if not thousands-- of people who are going to attend it. At least once in your education you have likely had to do a group presentation on some subject that you had to research with others. If you got an A on it and had to do slides and recite information without going &quot;err&quot; and &quot;ummmm&quot; every 6 seconds, I can wager you had to invest a lot of time preparing it. <br />
<br />
Take that knowledge, and apply it with that the many panel discussions at Blizzcon are manned by the actual artists, writers and coders that make Blizzard games (I absolutely must emphasize this). That they had an absolute non-negotiable deadline to get this presentation ready. Then they also have their job, the deadlines that they have at Blizzard that we may not see reported with minute detail on fansites or reported on by Blueposters. While the whole company probably acknowledges that everyone has to take a break to do Blizzcon, there's still the games to be made and finished that they were likely working on either way each day leading up to Blizzcon, and the deadlines that they still have to follow the day after Blizzcon.<br />
<br />
They are human beings. They can't do 92723 things at once, especially not to even bay down on &quot;NERF/BUFF PLZ&quot; whining. Cut them some slack.</div></div><hr />

Though I suppose it makes sense. If D3 is expected to be out soon™, MOP is already in the works and SCII is already out with HotS coming in they have a huge amount of work to do and realistically not a lot of extras to announce. Most things to announce would be adjustments, balance fixes etc... which realistically don't warrant spending huge amounts of money to host an event over for both Blizzard and the fans. I know I'd rather wait for a more wholesome Blizzcon full of events and good announcements than go this year and be disappointed especially when it costs roughly $500-600.00 for flights from here + hotels.</div></div><hr />

It is about the fans and for the games but would you really want to spend a bunch of money to go to an event and be disappointed because there's nothing really new to announce?

Then they would have to start the beta process no later than the middle of February. Unfortunately, I doubt they're that far into the development cycle.<br />
<br />
Seriously, I'd be shocked and amazed if MoP releases before November. Hell, I'll be amazed if D3 releases before September.<br />
<br />
Actually, I am pretty sure that you will see the beta in February/Early March with a late June or July release. Its an expansion, not a new game like Diablo III or a total world revamp like Cataclysm, so there wont need be as much beta testing. And they probably either have a very small Friends and Family alpha or just an internal one going on right now. Look at how much was already shown at Blizzcon last year.</div></div><hr />

When people say stuff like this is just blows my mind at how little they know about the MMO industry. How is WoW a sinking ship when it still has more subscribers than any other MMO on the market? Even if they lose another 8 million players this year they still won't be a sunken ship. Do you know how many MMOs out there have less than 1 million active players? Even the original everquest is still putting out expansions.</div></div><hr />

We'll see. If they do perform a number crunch, it will probably take a fairly significant amount of testing to make sure everything in the old content is balanced correctly.

Hey man these peoples know whats goin on.. with the internetz and the googlez telling you nothing but the truth!!!<br />
<br />
TBH blizzcon = a band, a costume event and then 'asking' the company 'safe' questions that if they are any way serious or or worth are laughed at by the panel and your pushed along, or just thrown a random answer that doesn't answer what you asked,... or when they get to display the lack of knowledge of the game 'the fireland's raggy from 10/25 man are different color'... ORLY???<br />
<br />
I'm sure it might be mildly interesting for some people to meet up with guildies or whatever but not for the silly price of those tickets. No loss imo.</div></div><hr />

This answers it. There's no Blizzcon this year, because they have nothing new to announce. Due to their shifty 18 month Warcraft expansion release cycle, this year's Blizzcon would be too early to announce the next wow xpac, however Blizzcon 2013 would only be a few months before the xpac after Mists of Pandaria is released. Also, this year is obviously too early for Titan to be announced, but next year is the perfect Blizzcon for a Titan announcement. Blizzcon 2013 will be huge though, it will contain news on the much anticipated Warcraft expansion announcement (as people will be tired of the Cataclysm clone that will be Pandaria by then), Diablo expansion news, possibly Starcraft as well, and most importantly, Titan.</div></div><hr />

Depending on D3 and HotS release dates, it could be way too early to talk about D3x1 and LotV. And 5.1? Yeah that sounds like convention worthy.<br />

They already said that they would nto announce it this year anyway, so having a blizzcon in 2013 is more likely to be announced there, with the third xpac of SC2 + maybe first diablo xpac announcement and another wow xpac, Blizzcon 2013 is SO gonna worth it, imo It will be a big show.</div></div><hr />

Judging by that, we can expect maybe another xpac announcement. Since they went 2005 BC, 2007 WotLK. MAYBE!<br />
<br />
well at that time, if i remember right WOW wasn't still yet quite as large yet and not much else was really new at the time for bliizard. in 2006 prior to BC release they spent money advertising and BC was promoted on one of the movie/music awards shows. also at 2005 blizzcon BC was covered.<br />

Frankly, if you care about wow, you should HOPE games like GW2 and SWTOR succeed.<br />
<br />
under a monopoly, there is no innovation. everything becomes focused to making the company more and more money. they don't HAVE to care about the customer, because, really, WHERE ARE THEY GOING TO GO? that's the situation wow has right now. there are other games, but with populations and budgets so low that wow doesn't need to worry about them.<br />
<br />
i personally hate SWTOR and wouldn't play it if wow shut down today. i do however hope that they do WELL, because competition is healthy. and, for the same reason, you should hope GW2 is successful. (i don't need to hope, i'm certain it will.)<br />
<br />
<br />
The plan for the next Expac of Epic Fail Ripoff amalgamation (world of Pokemon Kung fu Panda Guild Wars Factions Nightfall) is already set in stone (as in, they cant change that MoP is the next expac now), but that doesn't mean blizzard cant realize how stupid some of there decisions in the past year and a half have been, and take steps to fix them.</div></div><hr />

You honestly think WoW is going to &quot;end&quot; any time soon? <br />
<br />
Everquest is still around, and WoW and EQ2 &quot;killed&quot; EQ... with its 18th expansion released in november 2011. <br />
<br />
What happens with MMOs, that is pretty awesome, is once they figure out that they're not going to attract new blood with the outdated engine or some new gimmick, is that they start catering to those people who love the property and start doing challenging, interesting experiments with the game - that not always work - but are always engaging. <br />
<br />
Once wow really &quot;dies&quot; to the mainstream is when you'll see things like battleground map packs, solo raid content, basically anything they can throw at the game to validate an expansion. It will become a testing ground for their new/next flagship entity. <br />
<br />
And I think that's years and years away. Look at how radical MoP is. Unfortunately most of that is to try to cater to a younger audience of these apparently &quot;new gamers who are easily confused by things.&quot; <br />
<br />
We haven't even seen massive server merges yet. <br />
<br />
Heck, the delay of SC2:2 and D3 are probably because blizzard figures their only real competition is themselves. <br />
<br />
And you know there will be a bundle &quot;blizzard pass&quot; that includes all mmo subscriptions in one with perks like free expansions, etc. when that happens. They're not going to let their next gen mmo completely kill off the previous one.<br />
<br />
<br />
I will say, though, the asian themed junk in EQ1 was the signal that they're not afraid to alienate their fantasy interested audience and are going to try mixing things up a bit.<br />
<br />
I honestly think that the lack of competition in D3 in terms of &quot;everyone sees their own loot&quot; will not allow it to thrive as much as D2 did. It's also something to prove that younger gamers want a D2-like game. D2 *DID* happen right on the cusp of persistent online worlds, even though all it was was a persistent character that interacted in small instanced segments. The real money marketplace has a lot riding on it in terms of how all games will work moving forward, especially their own products.<br />
<br />
<br />
I just chalk &quot;no blizzcon&quot; up to the basic fact that they've got nothing they're willing to share at this point, and we don't need another MOP, SC2:2, D3 reveal. D3 would likely be launched by that time anyway, with SC2:2 / MOP in the thanksgiving / winter season.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't be surprised if WoW has the next half-dozen expansions all plotted out and finished to varying degrees.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rioo</div><div class="date">2012-01-25, 06:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A bit surprised but seeing how they'll just have released the WoW expansion, the SC2 expansion and Diablo 3 I can't blame them. Sure they could have talked about the next patch in WoW, but the only thing that's interesting is Titan and they clearly don't want to do that yet. So either a crap-ass Blizzcon or a nice SC2 tournament, I'd go with the SC2 one any day. Who knows, Diablo 3 might even be enjoyable to watch too as an added bonus.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nekosom</div><div class="date">2012-01-25, 06:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">People defending this crack me up...You think if the company/game was still doing well they would skip an event they have done every year for a long time now? They LOVE doing Blizzcon, or at least they used to till they started putting out inferior products. <br />
<br />
Nothing to talk about? Please...I highly doubt mop will be out yet, plus there is D3x1, SC2 protoss campaign, Titan Teasers, they could even do previews for WoW 5.1 etc.<br />
<br />
Considering neither Legacy of the Void or D3x1 are probably even in development yet and Blizzcon is only 9 months away, what exactly would they have to show? A teaser for vaporware and a content patch? They don't &quot;LOVE&quot; doing Blizzcon, they love the publicity it brings those products. You pretend like their motivation behind Blizzcon hasn't always been unfettered greed.<br />
<br />
But there's nothing to promote, so what's the point? This isn't a fan-run convention that throws these events just for the hell of it, it is a corporate-run advertising campaign.<br />
<br />
I love these people who wear the rose-tinted glasses and think that Blizzard's philosophy hasn't always been to make money. Blizzcon was a complete contrivance from the get-go, and I'm actually somewhat impressed that they're smart enough to know that sometimes a corporate circle-jerk isn't always appropriate when there's no product to show.</div></div><hr />

Titan<br />
Diablo 3 1 Expansion<br />
SC 2 Last expansion<br />
Wow Last expansion (Burning Legion expac, lvl 100, 2 new hero classes, many changes, bosses like Kil'jaeden (return), final boos: avatar of Sargeras, <br />

Honestly If blizzard pushes back MoP till next year they are going to loose a LOT of subs for a while. Even people who are pretty loyal fans will probably go try out Star Wars (like myself) Is wow going to die? I hardly doubt that, wow will die when blizzard lets it, because even if they do loose a lot of subs they will always have people paying them for wow as long as they put out content for it.<br />

How can you not care for something that you've seen literally no assets for? For all you know it might cater to your exact specific tastes and be the best game you'll ever play.<br />

<br />
Everything Blizzard has said points to sooner than that. They stated as recently as this week that they intend to release expansion content quicker than they have in the past. If MoP were released November 2012 that would put it 2 years after Cataclysm, which came 2 years after Wrath, which came 2 years after BC. To release XPac content 'quicker', they would need to release before Fall 2012. I'm sure they will. I actually think we're very close to the alpha/beta. <br />
<br />
Also they said recently that the version of MoP played at Blizzcon was 'far into development'. Another clue that MoP is closer than some think. I'm sure they'll hit their Q2 target. Then they'll hold Blizzcon early 2013 and announce WoW X5 and Titan.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard has been aiming for annual expansions for the past 3 expansions. I havent heard anything about an alpha for MoP yet, and the beta is generally at least 3 months. If an alpha begins soon I could see a summer release, and it would make sense for it to be summer given when we got 4.3. A full year of just 4.3 wont sit well with most people.</div></div><hr />

No source, but there were some quotes from a while back about it being heavily FPS based. Now that could mean we'll be chucking spears and shooting bows, but more likely a sci-fi based game......or it could be something completely off the wall like a wild west, or WW2 game but I doubt it.

<br />
Right, I believe that.<br />
<br />
D3 is going to be out 1st quarter, I'm betting; it is &quot;done&quot; but for some reason they're going back and making nibbling changes now. Heart of the Swarm... not sure on an ETA, but they're not exactly designing fresh systems or gameplay engines for this; it's effectively a Starcraft 2 Expansion. Mists of Pandaria is also an expansion, building off a set engine with set dev tools.<br />

Blizzcon was always touted as being 'for the fans'. People were already increasingly upset about the ticket costs being raised more than 75% over the last 3 years. Add to that the 'drama' of last year's Blizzcon.<br />

People are also fed up with Cataclysm. With MoP likely not being until fall, Wow's last Cata content patch a month or so ago, and the guaranteed beta for the 'yearbies' not starting until summer, there's half a year of some very unhappy customers.

<br />
Blizzard is in real trouble it seems. From recent leads of D3 fired, to a lead in Titan gone as well, it shows that they're struggling, and in no time soon are they going to pull themselves out of this slump they've been in to their old glory days. WoW is a good indicator with people leaving left and right. You can notice it on the message boards and fan sites with activity as in at times when there would be 1000 posts in a time frame on news, now there's 100-200.<br />
<br />
MoP is releasing this year, and not the end of the year like we're used to. Blizzard is going to be in full-blown panic mode as you can see with two of their big projects in various troubles, and one expansion pack for a RTS that should have came out a long while back. MoP will release in summer this time, or end of, because they know that they can't rest with Guild Wars 2 and company getting soo much media and fan attention. Mix in the luke-warm response to the MoP expansion, and they're very-very concerned. I mean, they're not even cashing in on another Blizzcon, something it's fans looked forward to yearly. Which means they have nothing to show for it, which is of MAJOR concern because that means Titan is in massive trouble. You would think they'd show something off about it to get attention away from GW2 and company, but they have nothing.<br />
<br />
This is when we see some major restructuring within Blizzard. Their time frames were out of control, and they're going to start embracing consoles now as well I'd bet. Maybe this will be the kick in the pants Blizzard needs to be a great dev again.</div></div><hr />

I will remember this post and see who is lol ing. All these &quot;thats way too long&quot; posts occurred at the end of wrath too. They are owned by Activision. If you think they are going to release this product at the end of the summer which is just about the worst time to try and sell a video game to people you are mistaken. Unless they can release it at the same time as GW2 to try and crush that launch they will bite the bullet and make more money around the holidays selling xpacs. The diehards and season passers dont quit playing and paying for this game anyway. Its these people that allow blizzard to do this.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, the only thing I do recall is that it's not based on any existing franchises. They've done fantasy with WoW, so sci-fi is the other general option. Although steampunk/gaslamp fantasy would be interesting. I highly doubt it would be anything &quot;real world&quot; like wild west or military - we expect more from Blizzard than that.<br />

Given that just about everyone who works for Blizzard also works Blizzcon, and with 3 major titles hitting, I don't blame them for not having one this year. Like most have said, MoP might not have even had a content patch yet, and having Blizzcon would push back work on that as well. While announcing things at Blizzcon is nice, a lot of us would probably much rather things were already in development - and perhaps ready for alpha/beta - by the time they're announced. That gives us demos to play at Blizzcon that aren't the same stuff we've already been doing. With MoP/D3/SC2 out - what incentive is there for me to go? No new demos - other than Pandaria itself, but I'll have been playing the beta already. I'll have D3 as well due to Annual Pass, so no need to demo that either. I've never been a big RTS fan, so SC2 would be the only thing I might be interested in. No reason to go. Although I will miss meeting up with some of my fellow raiders, that's not quite enough of a reason for all of us to fly to California (since quite a few already live in SoCal).</div></div><hr />

I have to agree here, its not THAT exciting to watch a bunch of Koreans/Japanese people playing StarCraft 2 &gt;.&gt;<br />
<br />
Or to watch a bunch of nerds raging because they couldn't kill a shaman....</div></div><hr />

I enjoy a large scale SC2 tournament now and again but WHY. THE HELL. ARE THEY. STILL!!!! FORCING. WOW. AS. AN. E-SPORT !?!?!?!?!?<br />
<br />
You can't balance an MMO! Arena has always been a joke and their sloppy attempts to 'balance' WoW by forcefully homogenizing the classes has done nothing but negatively impact the game!</div></div><hr />

Coincidence that it's korean/asian with them releasing MoP? <br />

Blizzard are SO trying to hit the eastern market.</div></div><hr />

As sad as it sounds, Blizzcon virtual ticket was one of the highlights of my year last year. Hopefully they change thier minds.</div></div><hr />
