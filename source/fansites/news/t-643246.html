Patch 3.1 on Live Servers this Week<br />
There isn't any official confirmation yet but the patch is now available on Blizzard download servers and it's only a matter of hours before we see a message from them. <br />
<br />
Raid Instance - Ulduar<br />
For millennia, Ulduar has remained undisturbed by mortals, far away from their concerns and their struggles. Yet since its recent discovery, many have wondered what the structure's original purpose may have been. Some thought it a city, built to herald the glory of its makers; some thought it a vault containing innumerable treasures, perhaps even relics of the mighty Titans themselves. Such speculations were wrong. Beyond Ulduar's gates lies no city, no treasure vault, no final answer to the Titan's mysteries. All that awaits those who dare set foot in Ulduar is a horror even the Titans could not, would not destroy, an evil they merely... contained.<br />
<br />
Beneath ancient Ulduar, the Old God of death lies, whispering.... Tread carefully, or its prison will become your tomb. <br />
<br />
The Patch 3.1 - Secrets of Ulduar (http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/underdev/3p1/index.xml) official page is now available as well.<br />

<br />
Ulduar is a new Raid Instance featuring 14 new bosses, 800 new items (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=861), Tier 8 armor sets (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=852), and hundreds of achievements (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=834)!<br />

Patch 3.1 - Season 6 and Vault of Archavon<br />
Season 6 will start a week after the deployment of patch 3.1. New armor sets (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=854) will be available and a new boss (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=854) has been added to the Vault of Archavon.

Mounts / Companion Pets<br />
Tons of pets and mounts have been added through the new dungeons and world events added with the patch! <br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Interface - Dual Spec / Dungeon Maps<br />
A few changes have been made to the default interface, the most important ones are probably the addition of the Dual-Specialization (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=863) feature and the new Dungeon Maps (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=860) added to each instance. <br />

<br />
Argent Tournament<br />
The Argent Tournament is a new World Event located at the north of Icecrown. The Argent Crusade is setting up this tournament for everybody to test their skills against one another before joining forces to battle the Scourge. Gameplay-wise there are new daily quests to do along with mounted combat. You will gain ranks as you continue to do the daily quests and be able to become a champion of the city factions (Orgrimmar, Ironforge, etc.). At this champion rank you will gain a currency that allows you to purchase new items like the banners, non-combat pets, mounts, and gear.<br />

<br />
Professions Changes<br />
A lot of professions had the reagents requirements of low-level recipes lowered or changed to match the latest changes in the game (Drops from &quot;old&quot; dungeons removed, etc ...). Make sure you also check all the new glyphs in the Inscription additions!<br />

yes, season 6 is starting one week after that.<br />

Is there ANY way to get sure of this?<br />
I mean, it won't be like the patch comes out tomorrow, then there's another week of season5, and on the 21st Season 5 ends and season 6 starts?</div></div><hr />

<br />
This was my first thought, that this WAS the standard 1 week notice that Blizzard have said that they'll always notify for one week before a season ends. But after re-reading the post I guess they decided it wasn't needed anymore, how fucking lame. Sure - throw some random dates when it can possibly end, but I still want the damn notice.</div></div><hr />

Also what the hell did he mean the Horde's partnership cost us more death than the scourge at wrathgate? I believe the forsaken that bombarded everyone didnt count as horde......considering they later on conquered undercity.

I concur. It seems like the &quot;media&quot; jumped the gun a wee bit too soon.<br />

<br />
The Patch Notes have been updated with the final patch notes directly taken from the patch files. Patch is now 100% confirmed. The amount of posts on the front page has been reduced to 1 to make it a little more lighter. <br />
100% confirm anything? If they're done with changes, sure, but there's still a lot of bugs to fix that don't need to go in the patch notes.</div></div><hr />

This vid is pure awesomeness. Varian being a beeoch kinda pissed me though. Once he and Garosh got separated he was like &quot;ummmm ok screw you guys I am outa here&quot;! and ported..... Also what the hell did he mean the Horde's partnership cost us more death than the scourge at wrathgate? I believe the forsaken that bombarded everyone didnt count as horde......considering they later on conquered undercity. Damn I always hated Varian but now I wanna rip off his fatass head cause he is a puss.<br />
<br />
Varian's point of view is that while those guys broke off from the horde, all of the horde is unstable and united only by temporarily similar goes... he thinks the horde can't be trusted and is a constant threat, so he wants to eliminate it.</div></div><hr />

Glad somebody took note of this, and I can pretty much say that this is going to play out alot more during the wotlk run...... let's just see if Garrosh is going to be smarter than Arthas.<br />

Either way love this trailer, it's amazing and so full of lore. Those of you who say it is boring should probably go back to watching another undead rogue 1 shot people with Linkin Park in the background.</div></div><hr />

<br />
you sir do not know what awesome is, that video was lacklustre, alot of infightign a dn absolutely no reason or to go to ulduar, sure we saw a preview of bosses , but what terrible things can yogg seriously do?? we didnt see any of that in the trailer (boss previews ftl)it din't provide enough instentive to rush into ulduar and find yogg sarror if that was what we needed to do.<br />
<br />
if anythign , arthas seems a much more pressing issue .What happened to the story telling of warcraft 3? common blizz are instance bosses nothing more than lewt guardians?</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's not exactly true, there was (at least) one incident in vanilla where US got the patch and it turned out to be so buggy and game-breaking that EU didn't get it until a week later.<br />
<br />
But in general yes, US gets the patch Tuesdays, EU Wednesdays. No big secret there.</div></div><hr />

&quot;We're extending today's maintaince. Something's screwed, we don't know what or how to fix it yet. The servers will be up whenever we're done.&quot;<br />
<br />
I'd be able to deal with that much better then this, &quot;Check back at 4. No wait, make that 5. Did I say 5? I meant to say 6.&quot; That shit pisses me off.</div></div><hr />

Thank you for your patience. We ran into some issues in the testing process which have resulted in delays. We currently do not have a definite estimate on when they will be playable, but we will provide another update at approximately 6:00PM PDT. We are doing the best we can to have the realms available in the next two to three hours. <br />
