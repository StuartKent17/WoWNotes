Activision Blizzard's earning call was today and we learned, among other things, that the WoW playerbase is down to 11.4M players. That's 5% less than before the expansion and it seems that players went through the Cataclysm content faster than expected. <br />
<br />
Blizzard also promised faster release of new content and expansions during the call. <br />
<br />
From Curse.com (http://www.curse.com/articles/world-of-warcraft-news/956087.aspx)<br />
During today's Activision Blizzard earnings call, World of Warcraft and its expansion Cataclysm were two very hot topics. Listeners asked a number of questions related to the game, more than any other title or franchise in the publisher's stable.<br />
<br />
Of note, World of Warcraft's subscriber base has reached pre-Cataclysm levels, according to Mike Morhaime, CEO of Blizzard Entertainment. He then later stated an actual number, with subscriptions at the end of March clocking in at right around 11.4 million.<br />
<br />
That's down by about 5% from the announced 12 million mark late last year (http://www.curse.com/blogs/blizzard-entertainment-en-news/archive/2010/10/07/wow-breaks-12-million-subscriber-milestone-proves-it-s-not-dying.aspx). Interestingly enough, that was right before Cataclysm released. In fact, it's actually lower than the milestone reached in 2008 (http://us.blizzard.com/en-us/company/press/pressreleases.html?081121) with the release of Wrath of the Lich King.<br />
<br />
But one important thing to point out, and Mr. Morhaime touched on this as well, is that World of Warcraft's subscriber base does not change linearly. It fluctuates based on content consumption, which players seem to be doing a whole lot of -- at a more rapid pace -- with Cataclysm. &quot;Subscriber levels have decreased faster than previous expansions,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
Surprising? Not really. We have to remember that when these numbers were pulled, Cataclysm was in a bit of a lull. The expansion had been out for close to four months, and most of its content had been consumed by a large percentage of the player base -- aside from heroic raids.<br />
<br />
<br />
Diablo 3 Public Beta in Q3 2011<br />
The 2nd big interesting thing from the earning call was the announcement of Diablo 3's public beta in Q3 2011, it looks like the summer will be busy between Patch 4.2 and Diablo 3 ... For more Diablo related news, head to Diablofans.com (http://www.diablofans.com/).<br />
The 3rd quarter reference in the earning's call today was a calendar quarter, meaning that we're aiming to launch the Diablo III beta between July 1st and September 30th. Keep in mind that it's our current goal, and of course that can change as development continues. <br />

2011 Arena Pass: Phases<br />
The 2011 Arena Pass (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/game/arena/) is split into several different phases. To help you gain a more detailed understanding of how this year’s Arena Pass will unfold, you can find an explanation of the different phases in this article. You can also find out which matches are counted towards receiving a pet or title!<br />
<br />
Registration Phase<br />
4 May – 21 June (9pm CEST)<br />
During this period you can register for the European 2011 Arena Pass Service. Registration will be closed outside of these dates.<br />
<br />
Practice Phase<br />
11 May – 8 June<br />
During this period you will be able to enjoy the Arena Pass Realm and practice your setup with your friends. Matches played during this phase will not count towards the pet and title prizes.<br />
<br />
Ranked Ladder Phase 1<br />
8 June– 22 June<br />
All Arena Rating points will be set to zero when this phase begins. Ranked 3v3 matches played during this phase will count towards the pet and title prizes. If a player switches from one Arena Team to another, the Arena Team that the player joins will have their Arena Rating reduced by 150 points.<br />
<br />
Ranked Ladder Phase 2<br />
22 June – 4 July (9pm CEST)<br />
Ranked 3v3 matches played during this phase will count towards the pet and title prizes. During the Ranked Ladder Phase 2 of the Arena Pass Service, players cannot switch Arena Teams.<br />
<br />
Prize Eligibility<br />
Ranked 3v3 matches that count toward the pet and title prizes will start on 8 June 2011, (once the weekly maintenance has ended) and end 4 July 2011, at 9pm CEST.<br />
<br />
Please note that phases begin once weekly maintenance has finished on the dates specified, and end at the beginning of maintenance on the dates specified (unless stated otherwise).<br />

Legendary Staff availability<br />
It's actually easier to get started on the path to acquire this legendary; the journey itself is more difficult though. Regardless, players who have cleared the prior tier of raid content are the only ones eligible to begin the quest line -- any player who's part of a group which is capable of accomplishing that probably has a good shot at getting a staff for themselves. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/174133/legendary-snorendary))<br />
<br />
Legendary Staff - Guild Pet Reward<br />
We're doing something wholly unprecedented in the history of World of Warcraft, by making the acquisition of this Legendary result in a pet for the whole group responsible. Never before has an entire guild been able to acquire any kind of item for helping a member acquire an item or achievement.<br />
<br />
We thought that was pretty cool. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/174133/legendary-snorendary))<br />
<br />
Legendary weapons in 5-man instances?<br />
At least for the foreseeable future, we’re shying away from the model where individuals or five man groups can acquire legendary items, because that could have several possible effects which don't mesh well with our idea of what these items should represent. The items might become common enough that orange becomes the new purple, or so random that the acquisition doesn’t feel particularly good, or we’d have to include a lot of artificial controls on how many of those items end up on a given realm despite a thin veneer of accessibility. Any way you slice it, we think that this would diminish the appeal of these items, and that’s not the way we want to go for now.<br />
<br />
We do want the path to getting them to be more than a scavenger hunt though, and we’re continually trying to make the experience of acquiring a legendary weapon more… legendary. We learn as we go. For example, we’re unlikely to ever again do the Molten Core / Black Temple style legendary drops where sometimes you get lucky and more often, you don’t. We think that was really excessively random, and perhaps more importantly, it lost the entire sense of ceremony involved in forging your weapon. To return to the point of discussion that spawned this thread, Dragonwrath is almost the polar opposite of that. Sure, there is a “gated” portion of the quest line, which involves killing Firelands raid bosses, because we want this weapon to be something that a group has to work for and so that nobody is completing their legendary on the first week. But there is also a ton of other content as well: many new quests, legendary-specific raid boss fights, and a great personal challenge which evokes the spirit of those old classic World of Warcraft epic quests. The staff is really awesome in itself, and is rewarding for the whole group which completes it. I think that’s pretty cool, and I hope that those who get the opportunity to pursue the staff feel the same way. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/174133/legendary-snorendary))<br />
<br />
Legendary items are only for people lucky enough to have a raid!<br />
I'm not sure that you can call being a dedicated raider a matter of luck.<br />
<br />
When someone plays a video game, they’re usually faced with a lot of choices. World of Warcraft has a ton of choices, and being part of a guild and choosing to raid is one of the more important choices one makes. World of Warcraft has also had a pretty clear structure of progression for a long time. There’s leveling content; all the quests, dungeons, and events which one can experience as they increase in power toward maximum level. Then, at the level cap, there are some new tiers of content. Top end daily quests, five man dungeons and heroics, battlegrounds, PvP zones and the like. This is all extremely accessible, and (we hope) all players who reach maximum level in World of Warcraft will experience all of it. Then, for the players who choose to pursue the necessary preparations and relationships, there are arenas, rated battlegrounds and raids. Those are the most demanding World of Warcraft experiences available, and we hope that most players will make the choice to take their skills there and see at least some of that content, since there are some very rich experiences to be had.<br />
<br />
Raids in particular are intentionally challenging environments, and they are meant to stand up as obstacles to overcome, to reward players who are willing to develop the relationships and coordination with other World of Warcraft players to meet and beat the toughest challenges the game has to offer. They represent achievements to aspire to and we put a lot of time into that content and try to make it rewarding because we want you to want to see it.<br />
<br />
Legendary weapons are legendary in part because of lore, and in part because of the grand adventure it is to achieve them. They are intended to represent a goal for an entire guild and raid group, and acquiring such a weapon reflects on the raid and guild as a whole. This helps us keep these items rare, which makes them more exciting and prestigious, which, in turn, allows us to make them more powerful.

<br />
They treat their players less like cattle then any other developers I know, based on how many subscribers WoW has.<br />
<br />
Also, 5% is nothing, second place for a sub based MMO is what, 3 million? It is a lull in content, so anyone who thinks the sky is falling can gtfo until 4.2 hits and they release the numbers then.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Prove that the people that have left aren't all the people that want desperately easy Heroics, then you'll have a point.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
But seriously, this is to be expected during a content lull like right now.<br />
<br />
And if you can prove that the gap between raid tier 1 and raid tier 2 will be longer than what we had to wait for during TBC between tier 2 and 3, and you'll have a point too.<br />
<br />
<br />
People trying to associate the fall off to 1 or two things, are wasting their time, because we don't know exactly when or how fast the numbers have dropped, which is the relivance thing we need in order to make an educated guess.<br />
<br />
People making a big deal over a population fall off that may or may not have happened even if NO mistakes were happening from the dev team (6 years is a long time to play a single game guys, remember that), we can't judge those mistakes as being a direct cause either. As people can point out, there have been plenty of historically worse mistakes that haven't caused the same fall off.<br />
<br />
I think the issue here is lack of appeal rather than driving people away. The amount of unique indiviuals that have stopped playing may very well be the same during previous periods, the difference this time is that before, a lot of people came back, and this time, they just can't be bothered.</div></div><hr />

The other things is the devs are making questing much easier for players now with the map overlays. In the past, a lot of quests would take considerably longer because you often wouldn´t know exactly where to go. They also made questing faster with new mechanisms like auto-complete questing and also quest hubs now require less traveling back and forth. All in all, this just make questing faster for us, but still require the same amount of dev time. I was a little disappointed with just how fast I got to éndgame´, which for me is just doing a few dailies and queuing for heroics.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Very true, but remember that Wrath's tier 1 was cleared in 24 hours, Cata and TBC both took 5 months, and TBC's was gated.<br />
<br />
Player mentality is the issue. Killing everything on Normal once seems to be enough for them to claim &quot;I've cleared the content&quot; and seem to forget what happened during the previous 2 expansions, which saw bigger lulls and easier content.</div></div><hr />

11.4 million is still a fuckton. We may have reached market saturation though. Unfortunately(or, fortunately, depending on your perspective), this means than any WoW-clones coming out soon won't be doing so great.</div></div><hr />

I wonder how much more we would have had if they hadn't of done that ? That and putting the A Team on Titan.<br />
<br />
they did say months before release that there intention was to re do the old content, and i for one dont mind, its actually nice to do some alts, and the whole world was remodelled<br />

Good thing I am one of those subscribers quitting due to lackluster content.<br />
This patch 4.1 didn't even release anything other than the 2 new dungeons really, most was class &quot;balances&quot; yet they are still not balanced at all!<br />
I'm looking forward to D3, it will be a while though.<br />

Maybe? Unless the 5% drop kept dropping over 3 or more quarters steadily, I wouldn't pay it any mind to be honest. Though it IS true that players burned through the content very quickly, is that necessarily a bad thing? It gives some people time to focus on other things and let them enjoy the game instead of feeling like it was a second or third job to them.... and someone made a comment about the dual boxers dropping their other accounts, THAT is HIGHLY more likely than people just dropping the game because of a slight lull in pace.</div></div><hr />

All the players that are getting sat or just not progressing cause all that left is all the bads to group with are just quitting.<br />

<br />
There is no &quot;one&quot; reason for a loss or a gain of half a million subs Sherlock.<br />
Many things are making people come and go it's never one single change/addition.<br />
<br />
Subs are now pre-Cata level that means that 500mil start/continue to play with the release of Cata and then left, you can't say that this 500mil is the same, they can be players from 2004 or players that played 2 months and left.<br />
<br />
When you see a number you have only this, a number you can't say for sure what's the reason on why people left and if they will come back or not.<br />
<br />
Either way it's summer,5months old expansion,5year old game i think 5% lost on their subs is nothing compared to what it should be, WoW need to lost a lot more to matter, they player base is vast and the expansion are keep on coming, the chicken still lays golden eggs</div></div><hr />

Isn't 4.2 suppose to be basically done? 4.1 content was suppose to be a piece of the bigger 4.2 Firelands. If they wanted to end a lull (or loll) they could have launched 4.2 sooner if players are consuming it faster than expected.<br />
<br />
I think most could tell that by how the 4.1 patch went that 4.2 wasn't even close to being ready. With 4.1 introducing a whole new set of fail, in terms of bugs and game issues, I cringed at thinking of what a bigger 4.2 patch would have done to WoW.<br />
<br />
Consuming the content too fast may have some truth, but I honestly think it's only a small part of the real reasons 600k people left. A few little things aren't a big deal, but as more and more little things pop up, and give reason to not play, it's only a matter of time before it's too much and people &quot;need a break&quot;.<br />
<br />
Blizzard not doing something about this lull means they don't have the people on the WoW team to get rid of it, especially when they have to consider the timing of the launching of all their expansions and new products. They could end a small lull now, or prevent a bigger subscription loss later when a new game comes out.<br />
<br />
hehe, gotta love how people try to put their spin on the situation.<br />

Edit: hehe, the 600k could have been from them banning all those folks running that archeology macro.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I really wonder with all that testing and PTR, how come they couldn't foresee frost dk burst 4.1?<br />

All those people that said Rift wouldn't make a dent were wrong. Patch 4.1 was a huge disappointment for raiders like me (in a semi casual guild) who have been working on HMs for a while. The addition of ZG and ZA gave us nothing really exciting, and a lot of the gear in there just gets disenchanted. Its a nice alt dungeon, altough now we have started raiding our alts too.<br />
<br />
So with the fact that we have had no new major raid content in 5 months, and Rift is new and exciting to a lot of players, any wonder with the big drop in subs?<br />
Although it seems they only think Cataclysm has been out 4 months?? &quot;The expansion had been out for close to four months, and most of its content had been consumed by a large percentage of the player base&quot;<br />

Then, we have &quot;most of its content had been consumed by a large percentage of the player base&quot; (in which case, you should probably push content faster, no?).<br />
<br />
I don't think that's the base is consuming stuff faster. I think that it consumes less content - and simply stop there. Less and less are coming back to the game at each patch, and it's evident that Blizzard has accumulated pretty much all of the potential players for the WoW game genre; there's not many more left around.<br />
<br />
Still, for an almost 7-year old game... it's in a pretty good shape.</div></div><hr />

Also Blizz are still using the WotlK formula of enforced gear progression which seems to make everything but the latest patch redundant and I don't really know of many players who approve of this, casual or hardcore.<br />
<br />
I've noticed people who have quit a few times in the past are still coming back to the game, but they're only lasting a few weeks before quitting again.<br />

get your facts straight, yes there are more people raiding 10 man, however about 50 kills on sinestra compared to 160 25 man kills, so please do some research before you start moaning about difficulty. 10 man raids have from the beginning been overtuned and just now over the past month or two been &quot;nerfed&quot; and actually have become doable on 10 man.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They don't 'think' Cata has been out for 4 months, the numbers pulled date back from 1st of March, when Cata actually WAS out for 4 months. <br />
<br />
People concluding the game is not balanced and therefore people are leaving should try some others recent MMO's and demonstrate which ones are balanced. From what I understand, balance wasn't something the Rift developers were even going for. I would imagine some complaints on flavor of the month classes for that game too. And I'm positive a lot of other games will have the same issue. Class balance in WoW is constantly being tweaked on a very small scale, because it is not a huge imbalance in any way. And any imbalance there is, usually gets addressed quite fast. <br />
<br />
A 600k drop in subscribers comes from people that have seen what there is to be seen (all quests, zones, dungeons) and concluding they either cannot be bothered to raid because of difficulty constraints, or just out of boredom because they have been playing this game for 5 years and can finally distinguish the addictive pattern it creates. New expansion, delete old gear, gather quest greenies that are superior to your overpowered and hardearned epics, quest/dungeon to max level, start gearing up again. Only 600k people growing bored of this and probably still returning when a 4.1 patch drops, or 4.2 arrives, is still good business. <br />
<br />
The sky will fall when the drop Blizzard sees is round about 3-4 million players, and a patch failing to return half of those to the game to check it out. Even then, WoW would still be the biggest MMO out there. Perspective, all you doomsayers should get it ;)</div></div><hr />

So true. All they talk about is how they would like to implement these awesome ideas, but either don't want to do it mid-expansion (lol we're not even past the first tier), or they don't have the technology (aka programming skills or want to prioritize it over say creating NPCs named after themselves), to do it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
- Fly around to potential places. During flight, you do something else not archeology related (I watch online TV, go work out, chores, etc.)<br />
- Employ the use of cheap 3rd world labor to dig for your old sticks. (Archeology bots)<br />
- Tell some guy you have a lot of old sticks, and he'll give you a shiny object.<br />
- Rinse and Repeat<br />
<br />
Like Archeology, smart people pay someone else to do the work for them, and claim it as their own.<br />
<br />
Archeology failed because people expected it to be more Indiana Jones type stuff and it turned out to be the worst profession you could ever design. I mean, you don't even play WoW 95% of the time. You're in flight, fly to the spot, put out your finder a few times, and you're done. Then fly back to the flight point, send your character to another place, and alt-tab to something else.<br />
<br />
hehe, it's like Blizz designed a profession telling you to do something else instead of playing their game.<br />
<br />
A bit of a tangent, but it's little things like this that make Cata a fairly weak expansion so far.<br />
<br />
Another example... I've enjoyed getting, and using, the engineering toys from TBC than I ever have with the Cata ones. Loot-a-Fail-Rang and Interrupt-Your-Own-DPS-Bolt-Gun were the two toys that were conceptually interesting, but poorly implemented.<br />
<br />
I mean, it's just a lot of little things they just didn't bother to touch on with this x-pack. I know, I know, a lot of old areas were redone, and yes, that's a ton of work, but it's stuff that is extremely low on my 'sounds like fun' list. I've flown over all those places, and I'd have to reroll several newbies to experience those zones. It's just not something I'm interested in when I've leveled up like 12 lvl 80+ characters.<br />
<br />
Updating the zones to redo them so it's exciting for new players was a good idea, but the end game, which is where pretty much everyone is at in an old game, tends to be the more important thing to focus on, and they didn't do a solid job of it.<br />
<br />
Firelands so far looks pretty standard.<br />
<br />
The devs are incredibly excited about offering guild members a pet for getting the new legendary since no other legendary had done it. Is it really that big of a deal to do that? Seems like a pretty small thing to get excited about. Like their expectations are super low or something.</div></div><hr />

Yet the first tier wotlk raid content was waaaay easier than first tier of cataclysm, if anything, Cataclysm lost subs because they decided not to cater to casuals as much.<br />
<br />
Heroic 5s were pretty challenging, normal raids were pretty challenging, I got through them but trolling the forums I saw sooo many people getting discouraged and quitting, imo they toned stuff down too late. Most of the people trash talking the casuals couldn't handle heroic difficulty, yet they were worried about normal getting too easy. Also I had to laugh when Blizzard said stuff like &quot;hey if heroics and raids are too hard just play normals!&quot; (number of normal level 85 dungeons at the time: 3) Then they wonder why people got fed up and bailed.<br />
<br />
I myself made it through all the heroics + normal difficulty levels, I'll admit I'm not hardcore enough for heroic raids but I had a good time of it... I've also been to plenty of Blizzcons, met a lot of the average WoW players, who enjoy the game for the social aspects as much as the game itself. That doesn't mean they don't want to raid, but I, as a guy in his 20's who has played a shitload of video games, raided a ton etc found normal difficulty raids right at about the level I wanted.... Now what about the 90% of people who have less experience/time/bananas/w/e than me... tough cookies?<br />
<br />
The fact that they said in Wotlk &quot;hey we more people to actually see the raids, because they really are cool content and they progress the story&quot; then they turned around and said &quot;hey play those three normal difficulty dungeons&quot; in Cataclysm made no sense.<br />
<br />
People want to be able to enjoy content, including raids. Look at Wotlk, plenty of subs with easier content, the more people who can enjoy bottom tier the better. I say put in another difficulty level (easy) and we'd be in a good place. Let casuals play casually and drop the &quot;hey we can be hardcore too!&quot; attitude Blizz, that isn't what got you where you are now.</div></div><hr />

Isn't 4.2 suppose to be basically done? 4.1 content was suppose to be a piece of the bigger 4.2 Firelands. If they wanted to end a lull (or loll) they could have launched 4.2 sooner if players are consuming it faster than expected.<br />
<br />
I think most could tell that by how the 4.1 patch went that 4.2 wasn't even close to being ready. With 4.1 introducing a whole new set of fail, in terms of bugs and game issues, I cringed at thinking of what a bigger 4.2 patch would have done to WoW.<br />
<br />
Consuming the content too fast may have some truth, but I honestly think it's only a small part of the real reasons 600k people left. A few little things aren't a big deal, but as more and more little things pop up, and give reason to not play, it's only a matter of time before it's too much and people &quot;need a break&quot;.<br />
<br />
Blizzard not doing something about this lull means they don't have the people on the WoW team to get rid of it, especially when they have to consider the timing of the launching of all their expansions and new products. They could end a small lull now, or prevent a bigger subscription loss later when a new game comes out.<br />
<br />
hehe, gotta love how people try to put their spin on the situation.<br />
<br />
Edit: hehe, the 600k could have been from them banning all those folks running that archeology macro.<br />
<br />
there are still unfinished dailies, bugs that prevent further daily testing and the firelands raid is not even open yet so its still gonna be atleast a month before its on live.</div></div><hr />

So unless you raid, there really isnt too much to do outside of Arenas. I loved LK content and played through the entire expansion as a casual player. But now the game is so limited...that is why I cancelled my sub 4 weeks ago. And to hear Legendaries to keep going to the raider....hmmmm....nope still dont feel like playing again lol.<br />

That's ok because I think they keep more subscribers by only having legendaries in raids than if they weren't</div></div><hr />

Yet the first tier wotlk raid content was waaaay easier than first tier of cataclysm, if anything, Cataclysm lost subs because they decided not to cater to casuals as much.<br />
<br />
Heroic 5s were pretty challenging, normal raids were pretty challenging, I got through them but trolling the forums I saw sooo many people getting discouraged and quitting, imo they toned stuff down too late. Most of the people trash talking the casuals couldn't handle heroic difficulty, yet they were worried about normal getting too easy. Also I had to laugh when Blizzard said stuff like &quot;hey if heroics and raids are too hard just play normals!&quot; (number of normal level 85 dungeons at the time: 3) Then they wonder why people got fed up and bailed.<br />
<br />
I myself made it through all the heroics + normal difficulty levels, I'll admit I'm not hardcore enough for heroic raids but I had a good time of it...

<br />
Well spoken mate....the whole point Blizzard made in LK was to separate casuals from hardcore with normal and heroic raids. That was SOOO perfect for my style. I still got to see end game content and it kept me going. But with Cata it's near impossible for me to do this. Even the heroic dungeons are a wipefest (noob tanks and healers now electing the queue made it even harder and longer to complete). With casuals making up over half of the subscriber base I think Ghostcrawler got lost in his world of gaming and lost the focus that made LK so great to all types of players.</div></div><hr />

The rate at which they have been producing content is incredibly lower than what other developers already do with their MMOs, especially when considered how many more resources Blizzard currently has. <br />
<br />
WoW is definitely going to slightly lose parts of its populations with the upcoming releases ( Star Wars: The Old Republic, The Secret World, Guild Wars 2 etc.), but if they can drastically improve the content production rate then they can avoid going totally downhill, which wouldn't be insane to think if they kept the old rate with all-new games around.</div></div><hr />

um you missed the point either way and the sarcasm at the end....for Blizzard to announce 600k loss in subscriptions in less than 6 months but oh HEY! we have legendaries with pets! Come on please....yea by far its not a panick button time, but maybe it should be a wake up call to get back to what made Blizzard so LEGENDARY in LK. If not, and all you WoW lovers can QQ all you want but deep down in the depths of that muttled wow brain, you know those numbers of declind will keep rising even with Firelands coming out....</div></div><hr />

We are already one month and 10 days passed the cut-off. Not to mention Blizzard probably didn't include people who canceled but still had remaining game time. I would imagine that number is way higher than Blizzard wants to publish.<br />
<br />
There have been thread after thread of people saying they quit, along with a ton of people giving their observations on their servers about long time guilds breaking up, people no longer on their friends list, etc etc.<br />
<br />
To say this is a lull, or some other anomaly and it has nothing to do with overall player satisfaction is not being logical.<br />
<br />
I still play Warcraft, I have seen the same thing happen on my server with the decline of people no longer playing. Frankly it doesn't affect me, I still enjoy the game, though I don't play as much as I did, partly because I thought the zones and raids in Cataclysm were garbage, and I took a break in January, knowing that I would come back and try out Firelands.<br />
<br />
I hope all the content in 4.2 will be amazing. If not, I probably will be done for good, or until the next expansion if it looks good.</div></div><hr />

Cataclysm heroics are defo not any harder then WotLK heroics (talking about 5 mans here).<br />
<br />
Something that should change tough, and i know alot of people will hate me for saying it, is that raiding should go back to how it was in TBC. Attunements for both raids and heroics. <br />
Making an additional level of difficulty on bosses with setting them to Heroic just doesnt do it. Bosses should be hard to begin with. That way, it will trully give you and your team a victorious feeling when slaying a boss. Heroic modes were shit from the start. <br />
<br />
And more grinding!</div></div><hr />

<br />
LOL yea I dont think so mate on this one....Maybe to clarify with the term 'harder' to a casual also implies time consuming (hence that is why most are casuals due to lack of time constraints). In the beginning when I hit 80 in LK I remember being in Halls of Lightning with a pretty good group (no LFG yet) and after a few wipes we cleared it in just under an hour. Never again in any heroic did i spend even close to that much time in a dungeon. And you're telling me that now 5 months of heroics you can wip out a random heroic easier than a LK heroic? Please lets get real and save some face on this one. Unless you are secretly Ghostcrawler and are just trying to add sugar to the sour ingredients in the pot, you fail in opinions.<br />
<br />
And why do i keep monitoring these forums someone pms me....hoping to one day find a reason to start playing again a game that i loved so much for 5 years.........</div></div><hr />

Im actually surprised u said wow cant peak again<br />
Many things they have been doing is little but as they go along like direct x11 smoother models the game is changing. The game has gotten more accessible but also more challenging. We arent haflway thru this xpac and already you want to call it fail. Not just you but many people. Ok wow dipped and your point being...people have things going on. Whats happenign with the game is and will always be changing. Everyone says why didnt they do this sooner..well it wasnt done sooner because it wasnt thought of. The interaction between GM's and the way they communicate and the way the game changes is just coming forward is only because of how this community is changing. WoW is far from done. Everygame sees decline and thats what happens. WoW imo is the future till titan comes out, so willl they stop developing no, will they stop creating no, will people want something else to play yea of course. Seeing as how far they come and how far the MMO community has come as a whole WoW wont and prob wont ever be done. When you speak of outproduce WoW what do you mean. People dont like that pay for this n that, I have friends who played rift and already quit. They wont play wont but quit rift and arent even looking forward to GW2, I cant even say im looking forward to it, imo its looks like another jap anime mmo. Heres my opinion like an asshole I have one liek everyone else. WoW wont die this has made to many social and even political aspects in life. Its mmo's as we know it. We are the community and we are the future, we may have diff play styles and we may have diff agendas but when it comes down to it everyone compares everything to WoW. That it why and it will rein supreme. Blizzard is gaming and they will make sure that WoW is killed by themselves hence enter Titan, its like beatiung a dead horse but thats been said over n over again</div></div><hr />

Their own development department know that's not the reason, and made Rise of the Zandalari before the Firelands to try to correct their previous misconceptions, and yet they still say that absurd? Oh, come on...</div></div><hr />

I am not sure what you mean by balance, but that is far from true. For one example DK's were not even close to the tops of the damage meters, in any fight; Hunters however were. So what does Blizz do? They nerf DK's and buff hunters .... amazing! Why? because of pvp! The fury warrior changes was to stop burst dps in pvp .... AND YET THEY BUFF ARCANE MAGES! Nothing like getting hit for 80k arcane blast and then reading the patch notes to see a 15% damage buff.<br />

It's not only &quot;content consumption,&quot; but the feeling of the core mechanics. Imo, healing feels like crap, tanking is frustrating, and DPS is an e-peen contest with other tards yelling &quot;LOL I DID 15K DPS IM GOOD *dies to fire*&quot; along with the community post wrath will never be the same as it was in TBC again. Also, pumping out content faster than bliz is now with the immense bugging when the patch comes live will most likely lead into a deterioration of quality, and I can get a piece of shit MMO anywhere. (I could just slip 15 bucks into my Aion account, how easy was that!) Time to go back to the drawing board bliz, cause this game has been taking a beating as far as quality and challenge since 3.2 with trial of the huge stinking load of crap, more like trial of my patience. (although to tell the truth not much can be done, I see most of the problems is community based)<br />
<br />
I rather enjoy healing in WoW right now, it actually feels like a it's my duty to heal people rather than show up and spam one heal and win. DPS seems to be an e-peen contest no matter what game you play, people are always fascinated with being first, being the top, it's not just WoW it's every game I have ever played. <br />
<br />
I personally think WoW's core mechanics are fine for the most part, the content is what needs work, it's easy for the most part, I'm not an utter completion freak but I have been through normal mode in current content and that is just dandy for me, now I'm waiting for firelands to come out and spend a few months rocking that out with my guild.<br />
<br />
There could be many reasons for the sub losses, hell I cancelled my sub for 8 months just because my band was going places, once it died down I came back to WoW. People grow up, people get bored, people just.. move on. Blizzard knows this and which is why they'll keep coming with the new games for people to play and a new MMO to appeal to the people who want an updated MMO.</div></div><hr />

Ok so you try n balance a game between pvp and pve. They said from the begining they didnt want to separate the 2 and keep all the talents in line with both. If thats your argument then it kinda sucks. One the game is based off of 3v3 pvp balance and if you havent seen that then wtf are you even doing posting. Balance is from a pve and pvp perspective. Really check how you play because hey just because other wont say it but maybe you suck at both and cant play your class. I know shitty pvpers who are awesome at pvp and vice versa so run your mouth more</div></div><hr />

Its just easier to get 10 competent players to raid than it is to get 25. Sure all the hardcore guilds are still 25 but they never had a problem filling spots. All the middle of the game guilds have a handful of good players and this 10m raiding makes it easier for them to progress. All the players that are getting sat or just not progressing cause all that left is all the bads to group with are just quitting.<br />
<br />
People are progressing through the content much faster now is cause they only need 10 good players and no one to hold them back.<br />

Same.<br />
<br />
WoW is a lot better balanced than any other MMO I tried, and most non-MMO games.<br />
<br />

<br />
I think this just goes to show you've never played many computer games before. WoW is better balanced than any other MMO (by a fairly large margin, too), and than most non-MMO games, too. Your perception of balance is either based on a self-defined standard where you yourself should either be just above level or noticeably above (due to how human perception works, 50/50 would appear to be &quot;mostly losses&quot; to you, sorry, ask your local red traffic light), or on games like Starcraft II (incidentally by the same developer) or HoN. Games which are based on pro-league level play and focusing specifically on the smallscape PvP-only balance.<br />
Since WoW has a much larger playerbase to balance for (since it has PvE and different kinds of PvP), the 1v1 balance is never going to work out as well as say in HoN.<br />
<br />
But again, which game are you comparing WoW for for this?<br />
<br />
<br />
There is one reason and one reason only for why players for the first time are leaving WoW rather than flocking to it: Heroics &amp; Raids are no longer fun - they're chores. Cataclysm was the expansion for the elitists... turns out they only make up a few percent of the total playerbase. Who knew... oh wait... I did.<br />
<br />
Ofc you might be right, but I wouldn't exactly call it a negative thing then. The quality of pugs has noticeably improved. Not only on a gameplay- but also on a social-level. People chat again, they talk, in ZA/ZG they discuss how to clear how many of the timers, and so on. It's no longer 45 minutes of quiet boredom until people get their VP dispensed.<br />
<br />
But, this is due to exactly what you said: Cataclysm forced the truly bad players (and I mean social issues as much as gameplay-skill here) to either improve, or give up on it. The ones who improved, hurray. The ones who didn't... why should I feel bad if they quit? The sub-numbers prove it's a rather small number we're talking about, and if they improve my QoG noticeably by quitting, I'm happy.<br />
The one big remaining problem now is that WoW never teaches you how to play while levelling. I agree universally that this needs to be remedied in some way, there needs to be clear restrictions and rewards for learning how to properly Tank / Heal / DPS while levelling up. That alone would improve lvl85 life like nothing else would.<br />
But in the interrim, getting the people who both don't know how to play and (and this is the dealbreaker for me) can't be arsed to try improving to quit is... good.</div></div><hr />

Oh please, give me a break. The argument is valid, your just out to whine with anyone who doesn't agree with your opinions. It has nothing to do with how good I am in pvp. Did you not see the Colossus Smash changes? 50% in pvp, 100% in pve. How hard is it to do that with all spells? They did it with CC too. <br />
<br />
Saying the game is based on 3v3 is total bs. This game used to be about raiding capital cities and AV games that used to last for a week. Now its about capture the flag and arena ratings. <br />

Well 600,000 subs is about £64 million a year less cash. That for anyone is a huge chunk of money, and money that will not be invested back into the game. Admittedly they will break all records ever set when D3 comes out, short term, this is a big financial blow.</div></div><hr />

ALERT: The following text is full of irony.<br />
YAY!!! Kudos to the loud minority, and minority wannabes, that made a lot of noise on how good Cata was by showing to those sucky players it's not facerollfest like that worst in the history expansion, WotLK. <br />
&lt;-----&gt;<br />
Blizzard should NEVER take back the huge business success WotLK was just because a tenth of the players whined on how everyone could do things that only THEM could in the past. They still had really hard Achievements the common folks could only dream to have in WotLK.<br />
<br />
NOW I hope this lesson is enough to them say SHUT UP to those complaining that Firelands have &quot;only 7 bosses&quot; and &quot;why I can't have more than 2 raid days on the week, if I play just for the raids&quot;. Go play some of the other aspects of the game and quit whining. Or go whine about having separated 10 and 25 locks again, since it's still gray area of which way is better.</div></div><hr />

I know at the start of wrath I was terrible with my warrior, then he got nerfed and then buffed over a couple of patches, and during that nerf time i kept playing him and kept trying and trying to get better dps, and when warriors got buffed again I was able to keep up with the dps of the average raider on my server. Mind you I did this without going more than 3/12 in ICC, and wearing half t9 and half t10 and no Needle Encrusted Scorpion.

&quot;Plus the strongest competitor to the game so far -- RIFT -- launched at the beginning of March. This no doubt pulled many away from Azeroth, even if only temporarily, to explore a new world.<br />

I wonder how much more we would have had if they hadn't of done that ? That and putting the A Team on Titan.<br />
<br />
i kinda agree here. maybe they put a lot of effort in redesign the 1-60 zones content, which is not exciting unless someone are leveling their alts. <br />
<br />
And there are some really basic but important stuffs (e.g. updating the old race models, gear customization, etc) which is never implemented in game, although people has been asking them for years. Instead, they create new FUN profession like archaeology....</div></div><hr />

- Cata was the weakest content xpac to date.<br />
- They failed to release content at an acceptable rate.<br />
- The perceived quality of the game has reached new depths (recycled content, recycled assets).<br />
- Their inability to balance the game.<br />
- Their refusal of allowing players to customize and make their character unique.<br />
- Homogenizing of classes making them all more and more &quot;samey&quot; and &quot;me too&quot;.<br />
- Their refusal of taking the time to balance PVE and PVP properly, because it'll take too much time to give spells/abilities different effects between both game types.<br />
- Their blowing off their consumer telling them what they want as opposed to listening to the players what they really want.<br />
<br />
Players are not buying their &quot;lol guys, we'll do what we promised THIS time, we swear, lol&quot;, and are dropping subs. This figure will continue to plummet I feel as people are very-very disappointed with how Blizzard is handling their game. Openly admitting your top-tier, best talent is removed and put onto their &quot;next-big-thing&quot;, which is directly having a massively negative impact on the quality and direction of the game surely does not help. Them also &quot;slipping&quot; up in an interview saying they are literally cutting corners in the quality and development of the game because &quot;Time is Money&quot; really hurt gamers perception of Blizzard.<br />
<br />
This is not the Blizzard of old, this is one that's greedy, cutting corners, not listening to it's userbase, and not prioritizing their money maker as they know it's running it's course, and instead putting time, effort, and money into every project other than WoW. You can rosey goggle this all you sheeple want, but this is the truth from someone who played for years and let their subscription run out finally.<br />
<br />
Do not think for one minute that they're panicking right now, after all, $9million a month is not chump change, and directly impacts their expected income for funding all their other games like they have been, as well as the amount of statues they can buy and put into their offices. And the panic is going to grow worse as more and more people will be leaving this game every-single-day until they step up the quality and effort they put into this game, instead of cutting corners, and adding &quot;value and features that people want&quot; (but don't really want) like premium services as remote AH and Guild Chat.<br />
<br />
I should have known something was up when I got a free trial to come back to WoW not even two-weeks after I left. It's only going to get worse for them as like it or not, Star Wars is a HUGE name in general. It'll be a fresh experience, and will do far more damage to WoW than RIFT even did. Not to mention all the other prime titles launching this fall. <br />
<br />
What I also should have known is we won't be playing Diablo 3 this year. At this rate with the later than expected Beta for it, it will fall into next year going by Blizzard's slowest in the industry work pace.<br />
<br />
It's a shame to see what has become of my favorite, most time invested game. It's for the most part their fault for reasons listed, but it's also a major fault of the sheeple that let them get away with this for so long. Not voicing out enough so that maybe they'll listen.<br />
<br />
Hopefully they bounce back and realize they have to stay true to their promises, start listening to their fanbase, put more effort into this game, and most importantly stop taking their fans for granted.</div></div><hr />

i disagree i think players have got bored of the game and just quit and new players are finding it hard to see why they should buy 1 game 3 expans and pay £8.99 a month for a really old game when there are cheaper alternatives about with equal game-play and better graphics / game engines. ya old games are just old.<br />

Where was the option for, &quot;I'm just bored.&quot;?<br />

WoW has become increasingly less fun the past couple of years. It's just burnout. Cataclysm is fantastic, but no amount of content can make an old game new again.<br />
<br />
this is just a decrease in subscriber numbers, and i bet the decrease in players activties is more severe.<br />

I actually know a lot of people are leaving the game without canceling the sub, myself being one.<br />
<br />
60 euro per 3 months is no big deal. I dont cancel it, i just play it from time to time, much less than before.</div></div><hr />

About 2 months ago as they were announcing that the Firelands would be delayed, Blizzard made the statement that people were moving through the content slower than expected so they were pushing back the release of Firelands to 4.2 and allowing ZG and ZA to help make the current tier easier.<br />
<br />
Now Blizzard is saying that people are going through the content faster than ever. Completely contradictory to their previous comments.<br />
<br />
Which one is it? Sounds like alot of corporate bullshit to try and appease their investors. My guess is a large portion of the 600k who quit probably felt that the game no longer suited them either due to difficulty or massive amounts of changes.....<br />
<br />
Theres still only a few hundred guilds worldwide who have completed this entire Tier. Those 600,000 people have nothing to do with them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Personally, I still have loads of stuff to do, doing some archeology, doing old content for achievements. I don't raid (anymore) but have done all the heroics once for the achievement. When they go faster I'll probably do everything for the meta... Call me crazy, but I enjoy undermanning ICC or even Naxx more then the new content. Solo or duo the Weekly raid in Dalaran, oh yeah.<br />
<br />
But that's me. I can totally see that if you have nothing to do in old content, have done the new quests, have maxed archeology, are stuck on progress... what is there to do? Dailies? <br />
<br />
The bottom line is, there are some players that have nearly done everything... That has nothing to do with the expansion, they would have burned out regardless. I'm pretty sure that is why the top 5 (ranked by achievements) players in my guild have stopped playing.</div></div><hr />

Sure there's no way to make game fun forever, but it was their failure to merge raid content, implement new kind of PvP which is not successful at all, instead of expanding arenas.<br />
I'd bet people would run rounds in Dalaran, uh I mean Stormwind much less likely if they could raid and pvp twice as much they can now.<br />
<br />
Removing progress from arenas and merging raid content saved people a lot of time. However they have nothing to spend that time on.<br />

<br />
I mean all those players that still maintain active subs while loging 1 hour per week etc. <br />
<br />
Also stating that players clear the content faster then before its completely ridicoulous. Infact raiding guilds have NEVER EVER been slower when it came to clearing content and the vast majority of the 25 man guilds havent even cleared half of the available HM's. <br />
<br />
Of course the above is directly related to difficulty and we never seen a harder tier in the past but the fact that most guilds are far zway from clearing the content isnt really questionable.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you did your dailys every day you run out of content (everything exalted, every reputation item aquired) very fast. About 2 months ago I maxed out everything there is possible to do outside raid content and archeologie (after getting the junior professor title I stopped this boring crap) just by doing the daily quests and running my daily heroic.<br />
<br />
So if you don't have a raid, you have nothing to to. If you have a raid, then you will soon find out, that the normal modes are not very challenging (maybe except Nefarian). Hardmodes on the other hand are too hard (the first 3 bosses are ok). This is also very well reflected in this:<br />
http://www.wowprogress.com/<br />
<br />
H: Sinestra: (http://www.wowprogress.com/achievement/5121) 348 (0.61%) and H: Cho'gall: (http://www.wowprogress.com/achievement/5120) 665 (1.17%)<br />
means hardmodes are too hard. 5-10% would be a good number.<br />
if you compare it to normal mode:<br />
<br />
Cho'gall: (http://www.wowprogress.com/achievement/59) 26524 (46.78%)<br />
about half of the raid guilds are able to farm the same boss on normal. <br />
So raiding is over- and undertuned resulting in bored normal mode raiders and frustrated hardmode raiders (ignore the 1% players that will now tell you hardmodes are fine the way they are now).<br />
<br />
So my conclusion is, that people are going through the content faster than ever if you exclude the hardmodes. So you have boredom&lt;-&gt;frustration which leads to quitting. And the game is over 6 years old now, so many try other games.</div></div><hr />

<br />
- 4.0 has been out since some time<br />
- Rift is still a new game, and people will start coming back ot Wow in a bit (4.2 maybe?)<br />
<br />
So no worries for Wow just yet<br />
<br />
Blizzard/Activision actually stated that most of the players have already returned to WoW. I dont think Rift had any sort of affect on WoW's subscriber numbers.</div></div><hr />

Really anxious to play it for myself. Great news there, too bad about the subscription loss, but honestly, they still have a LOT of subscriptions and where some people leave, others join, certainly nothing to place too huge an impact on anything.<br />
<br />
the problem here is that the Vanilla and most of the expansions really haven't dropped in price much at all, and a lot of new players arn't willing to fork out ~100 dollars for Wow, they go from the current somewhat snazzy 1-60 stuff, mind you, npcs basically do everything for you now, seems really meh once you do it once, anyway and then they hit Outland, and it's not as shiny anymore, a lot of new people are staying a bit longer then level 10, but it's not worth forking out a fair chunk of money to just give a test run of a game, which seems to have plateaued</div></div><hr />

100% agree with this post. Hardmodes are way too difficult.<br />
<br />
It annoys me when people claim you aren't done with the content since you haven't cleared all the hardmodes. If only 348 guilds have killed her, I dont think that's a playerbase issue.</div></div><hr />

Its that the content wasn't there to begin with. A lot of Cataclysm's development was spent on redesigning level 1 to 60 leveling content. I don't know about the rest of you but I buy expansions expecting to play new content on my main, not to go back and do all the level 1 to 60 areas. I wonder how much more we would have had if they hadn't of done that ? That and putting the A Team on Titan.<br />
<br />
Lets be clear, they spent ages redoing the 1-60 experience and then drastically increased the xp gain, plus threw in heirlooms for almost every slot so that new leveling experience lasts little more than a week, and that is being generous. They then wonder after devoting so much time and energy to that, how people can run out of content so fast.<br />
<br />
The mind boggles seriously. Most people have been saying for months the 1-60 leveling curve is both far too fast and mind numbingly easy. Even me, who usually enjoys leveling has grown bored since player power in relation to mob power has grown by about 300% since Classic.</div></div><hr />

Blizz gave me a 7 day free pass just 2 days ago and most of my complaints have been fixed, queue times are like 5-9 mins max now as DPS and I can do a weeks worth of dailys in 1 day, but when I checked the guild roster nobody was on and has been on for over a week, this was an active guild with over 200 people who were friends for years, I knew personally and were WoW addicts like me, no sign of them :( Its really sad to be honest.

I don't think that Blizzard did not take the usual seasonal fluctuation into account. This is more than that and quite frankly, I'm not surprised.

Cataclysm, for all that it did have, had very little to keep players hooked. Heroics... nothing new from Wrath, aside from higher difficulty. New zones... eh, only a handful of them, and they were all very linear (how many times can you run through TH and still find it enjoyable?). Raids... Blackwing Descent was largely recycled from Blackrock Mountain assets we saw 6 years ago, Bastion was pretty cool, and Throne of the Four Winds was short. 4.1 is barely tiding most players over - we saw ZG and ZA 4 to 5 years ago, and they haven't changed that much to keep most players interested beyond one or two runs, maybe a few more - that is a week's entertainment at this rate, at most.<br />
<br />
Players consumed Cata's offerings because there really wasn't anything to wow them. If you've done Vortex Pinnacle once, you've seen it. Archeology wasn't a slam dunk, but a grind. The revamped 'classic' world was awesome, but only for one or two playthroughs. After doing all this for years (depending on how long you've subscribed), it's getting to be old hat. People don't just want something new, they want something that isn't World of Warcraft.</div></div><hr />

<br />
11.4 million = none left?<br />
Most classes are actually more even this expansion than any of the previous ones. They need mass testing on live servers on how scaling and differing playstyles pan out. Not enough people accurately document and test out on the beta/PTR's after each change to give a solid figure. Most care more about trying to feel super OP with new gear and also how to corner the market when said patch goes live (tradeskill mats etc). So, once its live they test and adjust. As it is now, most classes have easy counters, and counter another class easily. I can only think of 1 class actually struggling in high end arena and that is hunters. Last look almost all classes still had players in the top teams somewhere, although not in as high of ratio.<br />
<br />
Also, this happens every expansion, numbers surge prior and during an expansion, and drop off after 3-9 months as initial content loses interest in some players. It has been a larger fall and sooner this time, but then it was also only 5 levels and less total zones implemented so the solo interest was much shorter.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;Looking for Group: Call to Arms&quot;.<br />
<br />
A development team that resorts to overt bribery to resolve a core game design problem is a development team that I will not support.<br />
<br />
The saddest part is that the system is working - not just because of the influx of noob tanks - but the &quot;outflux&quot; of decent players that are tired of being treated like they don't matter. When one DPS can carry an entire heroic group through a dungeon and then get no recognition for it beyond his own DPS meter, but a half-assed tank can fudge his way through a dungeon and get a free mount?<br />
<br />
No thanks.<br />
<br />
Your post may get lost in the shuffle, which is a shame. I think it is a very salient point. Over the years, there have been many bandaids used to address certain fundamental flaws in the game's design (some holdovers from Classic, some not) or to otherwise &quot;get people playing again.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike Morhaime says it is &quot;content consumption&quot; - if I could sit him down right now, I'd tell him it is a lot more than just that. Don't rush expansions or content patches simply to put more shinies in front of the ADHD kids. Really, they should shoot for a modest subscriber total, a 2-3 million, and leave it at that. Stop making WoW more and more into a pick-up, put-down console game. Find a balance point between quality and quantity in terms of content - yes, your appeal will go down, but you'll have a solid subscriber base. 12 million was amazing, but consider that a cresting point.</div></div><hr />

I quit and won't be coming back. I had enough of their, &quot;We'll get it right this time guys, we promise!&quot; line. They reached the tipping point, not just for me either, lots of people. I wanted to believe them since Blizzard for a long time followed though, however they changed, and they used up all of their trust points they had accumulated over the years. I was in a day one wow guild. At the end of LK, we had 45 raiding members. Today the same guild has 12 raiding members, and have considered closing up entirely. Not all of them have been unsubs, a few left for other guilds as we called 25 man raiding etc., but at least 25 of them were unsubs.<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyone else listened to the conference call and think it sounded like &quot;Hey we lost 600k subs but don't worry, we are putting new mounts and pets in the store and looking at more premium and value-added services&quot;?<br />
<br />
Yeah, I hate this &quot;value-added services&quot; BS too. If it was truly &quot;value-added&quot;, it would be free; more for your current money, thus more value. Instead they want more money to use the new features. That isn't &quot;value-added&quot;, it's just another new for-pay service. <br />
<br />
The game now has corners cut in development, and all of the other items that plagued it are getting more pronounced. All Blizzards response has been internally seems to be, &quot;Don't worry we'll sell mounts in our e-store, that will fix it&quot;. Blizzard changed for the worse when Activision took over, the impact gets bigger daily. They used to be about making the best game possible, even if it meant being a little less profitable (but still very profitable). Now it's only about the profit and nothing else, if it hurts the players/game experience they will do it if the bean counters say it will net more cash.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's a fucking bag of shit, dude. It's not like it's anything useful.<br />
<br />
As far as the earnings call goes, I think it's a good thing for them to lose a lot of subscribers. Activision thinks they have a cash cow in WOW. Well, it is, but you still have to throw resources at a cash cow, and frankly, they are taking the wow franchise for granted. It's about time they saw some hurt where it matters-- in their fucking wallets.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;Activision Blizzard's earning call was today and we learned, among other things, that the WoW playerbase is down to 11.4M players. That's 5% less than before the expansion and it seems that players went through the Cataclysm content faster than expected.&quot;<br />

Before that you could raid 25 man with the guild and casually run 10 man with half decent PuGs (or run some raids on an alt). Now most raiders are locked out from everything during a raid week leaving only mouthbreathing morons running PuGs.. When they made the shared lockout they should have doubled raid content. The imbalance in PvP is also quite rediculous and has been all through Cata. Clueless generic dribble Q&amp;A with the current incompetent and lazy dev team also doesn´t help.</div></div><hr />

<br />
^ Agreed. I love raiding 25man but it just isn't that viable anymore. Why do 25s when you can do 10s and get teh same rewards? Although it was a nice thought, I would love to see 25s competitive again.</div></div><hr />

- all (apart one) of the posters whining have a number of posts on mmo-champ 1&lt;x&lt;200. i smell a horde of trolls.<br />
- who cares about you leaving? again, it's not a problem for me and for all the ones who still enjoy the game.<br />

Now, personal opinions:<br />
- D3 open beta? WOHOOOOO!!!! I can't wait.<br />
- daily blink is LOL.<br />
- WoW lost subscribers? Don't care. I play the things of the game i enjoy, and when i'll be burned i'll leave. No need to claim apocalypse.<br />

Please, END THESE BAGS FULL OF CRAP ABOUT QUITTERS; if you don't enjoy the game anymore is perfectably understandable, but the fact you quit doesn't mean everyone should.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;It fluctuates based on content consumption, which players seem to be doing a whole lot of -- at a more rapid pace -- with Cataclysm.&quot; must ring some bells I hope :p. <br />

<br />
Hopefully though this will give Blizzard a wake up call and have them start pushing out a bit more entertaining content whilst focusing on the real issue in the game - wait times (which they are working on, but I'm looking more at pvp, horde vs horde are in rateds, why not in random bg too?). Though as someone said, for how big it is, they have done really well with it.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xotrem</div><div class="date">2011-05-10, 12:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I blame the players for going through the content faster then expected. On my server we are considered slackers because we haven't killed all the raid bosses yet. But I tell them that I am not bored because there is nothing else left to do. People who raid 4 and 5 times a week trying to blow through all the content set themselves up to be bored. That isn't the fault of Blizzard, that is the fault of people's impatience.<br />
<br />
So playerbass has dropped 5%. So it is still like 10 million over Everquest which refuses to die. It also goes to show that either the people complaining about the game are either the minority or blatant liars about quiting, because looking at the forums, the playerbass should be down 50%, LOL.<br />
<br />
But here is the rub, and this is a fact. There will never be another fact posted more true then this about playerbass declining. It isn't anything about what Blizzard is doing. If you say it is you are lying, either intentionally or unintentionally lying to yourself. There is only so much you can do with an MMO to keep it fresh. No matter what they without completely changing every single aspect of the game can it be made &quot;fresh&quot; again. So please, stop wasting out time and space on the forums demanding Blizz change everything and how you are leaving. The other 11.4 million people really don't care.<br />
<br />
As an aside, in our guild we have lost 2 people since Cata that have stopped playing. We have had 3 older ones start back since 4.1 hit. So I am not looking for tumbleweek to be blowing across the landscape just yet, LOL.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also, 5% is nothing, second place for a sub based MMO is what, 3 million? It is a lull in content, so anyone who thinks the sky is falling can gtfo until 4.2 hits and they release the numbers then.<br />
<br />
Discounting china which has growing sub numbers but lower sub costs, eu/na is looking at more of a 15-20 percent decline which is pretty large in less than a year. Also the last numbers they pulled were in the largest content lull outside of rs the game has seen so the content lull excuse is a bit null and void.<br />

<br />
March/april numbers =/= summer<br />
<br />
And historically when mmo's start to decline they slowly keep declining without some huge change ala f2p switch. Wow had a great run and im sure it will be active for the next 3-4 years but i doubt 2012 more people will be playing than now.</div></div><hr />

Also you ever seen Software which worked 100% when upgraded or whatever, its same like on patchdays blabla mimimi, this doesn´t work.. im sure everyone which knows atleast something about coding will agree... u can´t do it without bugs...

Subs dropped, cause its getting to the summer, also most ppl which want to clear content did it already and are waiting for 4.2.Nothing special about it.

Which one is it?<br />
<br />
At least this will provide a wake up call to blizzard that they can't slack on raid content like they did for most of wotlk. If sub numbers continue dropping (and they will if firelands is not good enough) then the shareholders are not going to be happy.<br />
<br />
If wow's sub numbers do decline permanently it'll probably start off slow but grow rapidly as guilds fall apart, friends quit and servers begin to lose their community due to enough people quitting. If firelands doesn't bring the standard back up then the sub numbers will just decline further.<br />
<br />
I hope for everyone's sakes that Firelands will be Ulduar 2.0<br />
<br />
Interesting thought: I wonder how many of those quitters were PVPers. People always said that WOTLK was the lowest point in pvp, but what if cataclysm hasn't met peoples expectations of &quot;fixed&quot; pvp? Perhaps the state that 2vs2 is in could be part of the cause.<br />
<br />
<br />
So, looks like rift took 600k subscribers.<br />

Take the most extreme opinion of your opponents you can, and then pretend that it's the norm and laugh at it.<br />
<br />
Well played. You and I both know that the people saying Rift would take half of wow's player base were:<br />
1. A tiny minority.<br />
2. Complete idiots.<br />
<br />
If Rift has taken 600k subscribers that is a huge victory for them. You can run mmo's on far less numbers..</div></div><hr />

&quot;old&quot; in that way that ppl which wanted to clear the content, in normal/hc already did it around that time. + that rift came + it already gotten hotter around this time (atleast here in central europe) and the numbers are from end of march in total -600k so nothing special about it.</div></div><hr />

I quit in LK from pure boredom especially after we beat LK in the first 2 weeks (Im in a medium core raiding guild meaning we don't push for firsts but we do raid multiple nights and hours), then nothing for 10 months. (ToC wasn't fun either but i waited to see how icc was gonna be, wasn't really worth the wait)<br />
Not sure how dungeons and raids so easy a retarded monkey can clear it is fun?<br />
To be honest i would rather have hard content that lasts so if you have to wait longer for a patch atleast you still have stuff to do.<br />
<br />
Sorry but i play a game to have fun, healing while also watching tv and eating dinner cause all i had to press was rejuv a wild growth (The LK model) wasn't fun, it was mind numbingly boring.</div></div><hr />

I still think WoW is still overall a good game, but it does feel a bit stale now. I appreciate that they redesigned the leveling experience but there just isn't enough to do at level 85 compared to previous expansions. In short, Cataclysm is more boring than TBC and even WotLK.<br />
<br />
I have no plans to quit WoW, but I am to the point that I only log in a couple nights a week to raid with my friends. I don't play nearly as much as I used to play because there just isn't anything else worth doing in my opinion. Everything is too easy: rep is too easy, cooking/fishing skillups are too easy, not enough variation in daily quests, character slots already filled and don't feel like leveling more alts, and so forth.<br />
<br />
WoW has peaked and it will slowly be shedding customers. It doesn't mean that WoW sucks, but just that the golden days are over.</div></div><hr />

I wonder how much more we would have had if they hadn't of done that ? That and putting the A Team on Titan.<br />

<br />
Yeahhhh. Less than 5% of the player base made it past Raz. Content that was over a year and a half old when TBC was released. I could have gotten another year+ enjoyment out of Vanilla and I only made it to twin emps(no, I didn't kill them). Even after you got your gear upped to current content level, current content was still challenging. Not hard, but the bosses that were meant to be gates still acted as such and if you didn't bring your A game you would wipe to them.<br />
<br />
Blizzard is right to an extent about the churn, but never have the minor balance issues that people QQ about constantly caused a huge sub loss. Also I see a lot of people posting with an opinion similar to yours as well. Most of the problems I see with the game are systemic, not balance related.<br />
<br />
The major problem is that a lot of these changes are coming from a group I like to call &quot;moderate elitists&quot;. Which means blizzard is attempting to cater to all sides of the spectrum at once, and they can't do that. No one can. The closest its ever been was somewhere in between Vanilla and TBC and even then I'm fairly certain it was accidental. There was a period in WotLK where they came close again, but in a different fashion that wasn't so great because it more or less invalidated a lot of content.<br />
<br />
40 mans forced people to take bad players and train them. I know, I did it. In TBC+? Bads just get booted. We had 20+ good players already no problem. Its not a huge feat to get 20 good players. fill in the other 5 with people that don't suck too terribly and you're good to go. No incentive to train, no incentive to help, and much less room to carry people. I saw some of the worst players turn into top 5-10 DPS consistently in 40 mans.<br />
<br />
Itemization is also a problem. There was never a problem for us getting people to go back to MC to either gear up alts(giving those players something to do) or gear up new players. There was always one or two awesome drops that folks didn't have yet. our second tank didn't have his TF, the token ret pally didn't have hand of rag, two or three of the rogues wanted a brutality blade. Etc. Even into AQ40 progression getting people to help others was easy. Out of 100+ possible drops the good consistent raiders wanted 10 or so of them, and the remainder of items were still big upgrades for whoever we were gearing out.<br />
<br />
This, while a lot of people(wrongly) say it was catering to the &quot;elites&quot; was, although I think accidentally. catering to both at the same time. TBC's major saving grace was Kara, and later ZA. I don't even know how many hours I spent in those two. A large portion of the player base never raided anything much beyond those two. WotLK's saving grace was double lockouts. Cata.... has no saving grace. Thats why its getting so much flak. There's no room left for maneuvering. You're going to play the game the way they want you to play it or not at all. Unsuprisingly(myself included shortly I think, unless firelands fixes a lot of systemic issues) a lot of folks are choosing the &quot;not at all&quot; option. As for sub numbers, thats just 600k that have canceled. Of my entire friends list most log on maybe once a week at best. Several haven't logged on in weeks and its just a matter of them taking the time to cancel their account when they realize the game isn't fun and they don't want to play anymore. In guilds etc. I see on my server 80%+ activity decline. A lot of guilds are being forced from 25 mans altogether, having to do 10 mans. Its the same on both factions.<br />
<br />
Another problem is the LFD tool. It basically rendered anything that gets put into it &quot;inconsequential content&quot;. Crap thats meant to be easy, and thus provides little value. The LFD tool was good when it was realm-only. There were still consequences for terrible players. People had more incentive to try to help someone out simply because they were liable to be grouped with that person again. Cross-realm LFD is and was a terrible idea and whoever actually pushed it through the door at blizzard is responsible for one of the most major systemic issues with WoW at the moment.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying Vanilla was perfect, Vanillas list of problems were generally simply a lot smaller than what has been created since then. Albeit the list was a bit longer, the items on it were of less consequence. <br />
<br />
<br />
Note: Cata is not too hard. I have a 95%+ success rate for random heroics with pugs. Most of the complaints seem to come from folks who run with guilds all the time who can't handle stuff that isn't exactly as they expect it to be IMO. Bad players are bad players. Deal with it somehow and move on, it won't kill your run.<br />
<br />
<br />
What I would like to see:<br />
<br />
As a Band-Aid:<br />
Vanilla realms, and TBC realms for those who liked that xpac better.<br />
<br />
<br />
To fix issues:<br />
Removal of cross-realm LFD. Lockouts returned to 10 man and 25 man. Hardmodes eliminated, and a return to gated progression systems in which there was a real sense of progression rather than a &quot;Well.... we cleared all there is to clear... wanna do it again for slightly better loot and epeen?&quot; (Hint: Most guilds are choosing not to do heroics, either directly or indirectly due to their players not wanting to crawl through the same crap but harder. Its not due to a lack of competency for many of them).<br />
<br />
Last, but not least. A return to 40 mans. I put this one last, because its more opinion and anecdotal evidence related than the rest. However most folks I've talked to that played through the 40's in Vanilla agree with me. The guilds that failed to do 40 mans were often the guilds that weren't worth playing for anyways as they wouldn't help their own players out.<br />

Somewhere between $1.5 and 2 BILLION a year! Blizzard couldn't care less about losing a few customers, and their line about faster deployment of new content is a joke. If they could have rolled out new content you would think they would be doing it already as people are crying for new content for more than a year. I highlighted new because rehashing old content (Naxx / Deadmines / SFK / ZA / ZG / Ragnaros with legs.) just doesn't cut it for players that were here for vanilla and BC. They have seen the content sometimes hundreds of times only to have to do it all again to get new loots...</div></div><hr />

<br />
TBC model was best. It wasnt HC as Vanilla. It was more accesible for players then Vanilla. But everything was slower. Reputation was slower, gearing was way slower. HC players had top tiers raids. And casuals did they reputations, HC dungeons and sometimes low tier raids. Everything was in &quot;balance&quot;.<br />
<br />
Now? You hit 85. You log in, touch one button and you are in dungeon. You dont have to do anything for it. No key, no reputation nothing. After dungeon ther is nothing to do. Only log on your alt. In this game you have everything TOO FAST. That why is there boredrom.</div></div><hr />

Female goblins look awesome and female worgen look like rabid chihuahuas who got into some makeup, all because they wanted to make their release date. They didn't listen to the players at all, so I decided I would go to a game that did. All of my WoW-playing friends agree that they were a massive failure, but I guess I can't be surprised. The females of each race always looked like a different species completely, which is why they stand up straight when the males hunch, and why female worgen have pupils and males don't. Female worgen also have jaws that look so thin and brittle that they'd break if they tried to bite something.<br />
Not to mention this expansion is focused around the Horde, and even then, they ruined how Garrosh looked. They gave Malfurion a new skin and didn't bother with Tyrande, who deserves it more.<br />
Need I go on about the reskinning and slowness in releasing content we've all experienced before?<br />

Just because they are down 600k its not the end of the world. 11.4 million is still 11 million more then most games have. On cod at any given time they have around 300,000 people online. League of legends there is 200,000. Nothing else comes close to WOW.</div></div><hr />

If you have the chance to get $100, but end up with just $85, the $15 are effectivelly lost to you. I am sure however that Blizz is doing his math properly. Keeping as many subscribers as possible while having as small budget as possible seems to be the business strategy right now. You don't end up with the best game, but you do end up with biggest overall profit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, if you look at WoW's market share it has been steadily declining during the last two years and half, unless the MMO market was also stagnant during this period (something I really doubt).<br />
<br />
While WoW is still quite strong, It seems to be past it's prime, and Blizzard does not seem to know how to turn it around. This, in turn, opens a very big opportunity window for other MMOs to grow strongly despite WoW's market leadership. I don't expect WoW to lose it's leadership in the next couple years, but if games like Rift, SW:TOR, or GW2 can deliver their full potential, they might get a shot at being #1 in a few years.</div></div><hr />
