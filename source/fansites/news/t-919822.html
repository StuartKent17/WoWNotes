Some people have been requesting models of Firelands Raid weapons, here is your preview! You can probably expect more content in the next 2 weeks now that we have a release date for the patch forcing me to enter my &quot;OMG HURRY!&quot; mode.  
 
Also, keep in mind that these models might be slightly different in-game, etc ... but most of the time they should be fairly accurate. (And some of them look pretty nice)

Reminder - Ask The Devs #9 - Tanking<br />
The latest Ask the Devs was published a couple of hours ago and focused on tanking, it had a couple of interesting information and you might want to read it. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Ask The Devs #9 - Tanking (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/2333-Ask-The-Devs-9-Tanking)<br />
<br />
<br />
Among other things, developers hinted at the next legendary weapon to be released in Patch 4.3.<br />
Q: Will we see a tanking Legendary sometime soon? – Pedoso (NA)<br />
<br />
A: The tanking community both loves and hates when this question comes up, but it received a lot of votes, so we’ll answer it. The answer is not soon, but probably eventually. The problem with tanking legendaries, of course, is that the shield-users and non-shield-users tank with different weapons. That’s not a deal breaker, but it is a consideration. We could allow the legendary to be transformed from a one-hander to two-hander or we could just design an item for a more narrow audience (such as a shield). The 4.2 legendary has fairly wide appeal, and the 4.3 legendary will have much more narrow appeal. We don’t want to fall into the trap of making legendaries too formulaic. <br />

Making poison buffs permanent<br />
I remember when I had to mix poisons using reagents, buy different reagents depending on which level of poison I wanted to create, they had charges as well as duration, and they were wiped every time I zoned into or out of an instance... Uphill, in the snow, beset by amorous troggs, both ways.<br />
<br />
I think that when we apply poisons (or cast any buff, really) it makes us feel more connected to our characters and what they're about. It would be marginally more convenient to simply cast a buff once (or never cast it at all) and forever benefit from the buff in question, but that's not very interesting or involving. It would also remove a lot of context; your character should be more than just a collection of pixels. What you do in-game should have some meaning; even if it's as simple as tipping a bottle and poisoning a dagger.<br />
<br />
Of course, things have become more convenient over time as well, and there may be a time when it makes sense to remove a buff duration. I just wanted to point out that it's not totally pointless, and even the slightly &quot;inconvenient&quot; things play a role in how it feels to play a class. <br />
<br />
[...] I think the current system balances a sense of involvement with convenience pretty well. I'd rather be fighting mobs or PvPing than sitting in Ironforge buying bagfuls of reagents to fill my poison bag, but I feel that it's good that I still need to pay a visit to the Shady Dealer now and then.

<br />
Same place they got the last boss from :p. Would only make sense that he'd drop it, again, as it is pretty much, his weapon. And 4.3 legendary? They should slow down on these things... I know WotLK had 2 but not right after another &gt;.&lt; unless 4.3 is the last patch, then they add a bootleg 1 boss raid for us to play with till next expansion.</div></div><hr />

I loved the first version of Tarecgosa's rest since it looked like a simple branch like old school wizards, or some kind of Harry Potter's wand like someone mentioned when the model was first datamined, but god I love the Gnarled one!<br />
<br />
I would also like to know if the Stave_2H_FirelandsRaid_D_03, the former model for Tarecgosa's rest is really going to be implemented or Boubouille simply decided to throw it in there because it is Fireland themed. The Stave_2H_FirelandsRaid_D_02 model kind of look similar to the final version though, maybe blizzard decided to reuse that model instead of throwing it away.<br />
<br />
Appart from that, most weapons and shields looks amazing!</div></div><hr />

<br />
cause one-handers the size of two-handed weapons was awesome during tbc.....oh wait no it wasnt (not counting the legendary blades). I'll only be fine with one handers being as big as they used to be as long as two handers are as big as the swords from naxx 2.0</div></div><hr />

<br />
^ this<br />
<br />
there's nearly no difference between the size of 1h and 2h...<br />
this sucks...<br />
1h should be smaller... cause you swing them fast<br />
2h should be bigger.... cause there's a reason they have a 3+ speed</div></div><hr />

<br />
The one which is slightly blue coloured does not suit the hammer imo, but that might be because i'm used to the old model.<br />
<br />
It's just that the red versions look very similar to the legendary one, and thus give back the legendary feeling as well compared to the blue one.<br />
<br />
but still, i like a lot of these weapons ^^</div></div><hr />

<br />
Pretty obvious since it's a full half a tier higher in item level than the rest of the stuff in the rest of the raid.<br />
<br />
http://ptr.wowhead.com/item=69897 Normal Mode 378<br />
http://ptr.wowhead.com/item=71466 Heroic version 391<br />
<br />
http://ptr.wowhead.com/item=71352 Normal version 384<br />
http://ptr.wowhead.com/item=70723 Heroic Version 397<br />
<br />
Also um<br />
http://www.wowheadnews.com/blog=189887/patch-4-2-firelands-boss-loot-including-where-pureblood-fire-hawk-drops<br />
Pretty much has the full loot table datamined ands which boss drops what. <br />
<br />
So yeah, I would say there is a pretty high chance ragnaros drops the new sulfuras mace.<br />
<br />
Ragnaros works like Kel'Thuzad and The Lick King. He drops items with a higher level than what is found on the preceeding bosses in the same instance.</div></div><hr />

As for the weapons, they all seem very glowy so I'm not sure how thats going to multiply with Enchants.<br />
<br />
A lot seem kinda &quot;meh&quot; though, and overdesigned.<br />
<br />
As for the Rogue thing I'm SO glad poisons arent going to be a permanant DeBuff. I know it makes the games &quot;easier&quot; now, but I always felt a lot more connected with my character and his &quot;rogueyness&quot; when I used to have to actually buy vanishing powder and used to mix up all the poisons my self to apply.<br />
<br />
It sounds daft but I think they kinda lost part of the connection when they took that away.</div></div><hr />

With that being said, I'm glad for once Rogues get an awesome looking dagger, it resembles the Blades of Athena that Kratos used in GoW2.<br />
Of course I've seen a few Rogues running around with variations of the name Kratos but now I'm sure someone is going try to look like Kratos in-game duel wielding those (we've seen Superman &amp; Wonderwomen in SSOTD, so it won't be long)<br />

maybe but i spend alot of money on poisons alone... going to the shady vendor costs me 10 or 12 gold to buy a few stacks of poisons daily... it adds up... I think you should implement a poison flask to dip ur daggers and swords in.. Making it reusable. otherwise poisons take up bag space and are a inconvience to reapply midfight cause doh they fell off and their goes 75 % of deeps as mut.</div></div><hr />

Yes, the 1H sword model looks quite a lot like the Aldor exalted sword, because of the tip. You're right!</div></div><hr />

The entire raid is essentially Molten Core 2.0. Why are you not surprised the weapons found therein look like the weapons found in the old raid.<br />

It was the same with Blackwing Descent, or rather Blackwing Lair 2.0. One of the best two handed weapons from BWD is a remodeled sword from the old Blackwing Lair.</div></div><hr />

And I also do NOT like that ever since some time in WotLK they started making two handed weapons tiny. I mean they're so short... Look at the 2H Sword here, it's barely bigger than the 1h Swords are. In fact old 1h swords from TBC have been bigger than these 2Hs. And then there's the staff that looks to be the typical hunter/feral druid staff. It has the same look here as they had back in WotLK and beyond. It's a shame the best looking weapon here is Sulfuras and it's from 2004. Although I will say I do like how the shields and the legendary staff look. <br />
<br />
But seriously look at these weapons and think back to some of the WotLk tier weapons. Such as the new firelands polearms. They look the exact same as many before them. I just don't get why they keep making these weapons look so damn similar. I'm not trying to be all negative, but really if you can't tell how similar some of these look to previous weapons I just don't know what to say.<br />
<br />
I will say however I think the artists did a great job with most of the armor tiers for this patch. While a lot of people hated them, I thought they did a really good job for the most part. <br />
My biggest complaint all in all is that they are making weapons (2h especially) smaller and smaller. If you don't believe me, go look at a picture of the classic Ashkhandi from BWL and compare it to the Ashkhandi from BWD. The Descent's version is way smaller. Weapons should be huge and intimidating, not dainty =\<br />
<br />
Edit: I forgot to include the daggers in what I really like about the new weapons here. That flaming dagger is the best looking dagger since Perd's Blade imo</div></div><hr />
