In the upcoming patch we are adding a new feature to the Icecrown raid instance that allows the raid leader to change the instance's difficulty setting on a boss per boss basis. The way the raid leader chooses to switch is the same as now, by right-clicking on the character portrait. The difficulty settings can be changed from inside Icecrown Citadel, with some restrictions. For example, you cannot change the difficulty in combat or during certain events specified by our design team. To enable the ability to change the raid difficulty to heroic, you must first defeat the Lich King on normal mode, as doing so unlocks the heroic version of this raid instance. There is no heroic version of trash; meaning changing the difficulty will only affect boss difficulty.<br />
<br />
We chose this particular functionality because we didn't want to use the Trial of the Crusader method, and have four versions on a raid of this size. We felt the Ulduar method of having to know a certain trick to do on the boss was difficult to communicate and tied too heavily to achievements. We might eventually convert Trial of the Crusader over to this new system but Ulduar and Naxxramas will likely never change. <br />
<br />
PUG with the Blues<br />
Now comes the time to be a forum hero and fraps how you wiped because of a Blizzard employee.<br />
Come join the fun on the PTR and instead of getting the PUG blues, you could end up grouped with a blue. Members of the Development Team (including the encounter designers themselves) and the Community Team will be on the PTR to test out the new dungeon system and want you to come join in the fun. Join us tomorrow, November 4 beginning at 4 PM PST. (PST Time (http://www.time.gov/timezone.cgi?Pacific/d/-8))<br />
<br />
For a chance to group with us, be sure to use the Dungeon system and choose the &quot;Random Heroic&quot; option. <br />
<br />
[...] To be specific, we'll be queuing using the &quot;Random Heroic&quot; option in the new Dungeon system. If you want a chance to join a group with one of us, you'll need to queue up this way as well. <br />
<br />
[...] All Blizzard employees participating should have the &lt;GM&gt; tag in front of their names. Each employee will be able to pick whatever class, realm, and faction he or she wants. <br />
<br />
[...] In total there should be 30-40 Blizzard developers, producers, and community team members using the Dungeon system for at least an hour.</div></div><hr />

I guess you'd have to know one way or the other, or else whats the point in telling the community to do this?</div></div><hr />

Seriously though I wonder what happens if you get a blue in group I know I wouldn't want to do a dungeon with them, id rather pester them about changes and ask questions about the design intent. Blues only get real data and answers when no one knows they are looking.</div></div><hr />

Just thought about something, what if the group they end up in is worthless? Like whipe 5 times on the first boss or something like that. Will they just leave the group, cheat or just out stand the pain?</div></div><hr />

afaik instance servers are different from realm servers. so the simplest guess would be: first one to enter an ini sets the instance server and all other group members join that one.<br />
<br />
second<br />
i doubt that any blizz employee of importance will be on any other than the US ptrs. on EU, thats where i play, if at all, there will be some random GMs forced to do an hour(as stated in the blue post), wich would be one or two inis at most, and send back an evaluation of their experience in 3-5 lines of an email to blizz HQ... noone to answere any substantial questions or smthn like that.</div></div><hr />
