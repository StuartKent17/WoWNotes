It’s been a while since we’ve delved into some of the nuts and bolts of World of Warcraft, but today we wanted to talk about an exciting visual update we’re working on for Legion—extended draw distance.<br />
<br />
For the new expansion, we’re making some under-the-hood changes that will make it possible players to see more of the world than before. This new perspective on World of Warcraft won’t be limited to the Broken Isles. Players who return to the Eastern Kingdoms and Kalimdor will also be able to see distant terrain and buildings from farther away than previously possible.<br />
<br />
You can see the dramatic difference for yourself between the old and new draw distance in the following screenshots.<br />
<br />
This first image is taken from vantage point in Shadowmoon Valley looking toward Karabor from midway through the zone—first on the current Ultra setting and then on the new Graphics Level 8 setting.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
In this screenshot, Karabor isn’t even visible as a silhouette on our highest graphics draw distance for Warlords of Draenor (Ultra). The equivalent setting in Legion will result in the next screenshot once this change goes into the game.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Now that we’ve shown you what to expect, let’s dig further into what’s going on behind the scenes.<br />
<br />
There are two numbers that contribute to how far the player can see terrain and structures in World of Warcraft. These numbers are the “fog distance”—a depth from the camera at which point any object’s pixels are fully converted to the fog color—and an overall draw distance, after which we clip all object geometry, preventing anything past that point from drawing. On lower settings, you can see the second value as terrain and buildings seem to melt into existence, fully fogged, before slowly getting colored as you get closer to them.<br />
<br />
In Warlords, the highest-end hardware that can reliably run the Ultra setting manages to push the fully fogged distance to about 1,300 “game units” (yards). After that point, all objects would be drawn filled in with the fog color until the clipping distance. The same setting in Legion will draw out to 2,600 game units. Those who currently play at High settings in Warlords and see out to 1,000 units will see 2,200 units in Legion. Graphics Level 10 is currently set at 3,500 game units, which you can see in that last screenshot. It’s important to note that due to memory considerations, all of these new draw distances are only available in the 64-bit client.<br />
<br />
If you’re interested in the “how,” a bulk of the effort to achieve this went into changing the way we draw terrain and water in WoW to render fewer vertices at a distance. But it also necessitated the implementation of Level of Detail (LOD) for game models, like trees, and buildings as well. A model with LOD can swap to a lower polygon count model at a distance without negatively impacting the visual quality of the scene. We prototyped aspects of these systems in both Warlords of Draenor and Mists of Pandaria and learned enough from those two expansions to feel confident about making this change in Legion.<br />
<br />
Another important change related to performance and quality will be the number of graphics options. We are retiring the concept of Low, Fair, Good, High, and Ultra in favor of a numerical scale. In Legion you’ll play the game on options 1 through 10, with 1 being the lowest we support and 10 being the highest. The old graphics settings land around 3 being comparable to the old Low and 7 being a match for the old High. This gives us even more room around the minimum spec and the recommended spec to either ease burdens on low end hardware or push titanic configurations.<br />
<br />
Please note that as we progress through the beta, we may make additional changes to draw distances in order to deliver the best gameplay experience and performance. These changes are currently available to check out in the Legion beta test.</div></div><hr />

It auto tones down the spell effects in large groups, there are some hidden settings to tune it (maybe? I don't remember).</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm very curious how this is gonna look in Uldum. That's probably the one zone of all that feels the most &quot;massive&quot;, and where draw distance has always lead to some problems before, like those Skywall towers not being seen until pretty up close, and so on. Probably gonna look so much better now :)</div></div><hr />

If it's doing it already then it definitely needs some more tweaking, heh. The level it's at now in anything greater than a 5 man is just way too much IMO.</div></div><hr />

For a few minutes until you had to change the fueling rod in your compact nuclear reactor to continue powering your bank of supercomputers. Exaggeration ofc but you must have had some cutting edge hardware to do that however many years ago that was.</div></div><hr />

Why don't they do some real &quot;under the hood&quot; stuff like adding support for more than a single fuckin' core?<br />
2016 m8s, I understand WoW has to run on even the oldest of toasters but for those of whom who like to play at 4K res and even with an enthusiast level machine are only able to get 30 fps or less on certain boss fights it's a little infuriating.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not sure what you're looking at but the fog starts a lot further, hence, increasing the draw distance</div></div><hr />

<br />
After placing the before and after pics on separate tabs so i could compare full size images one after the other and really looking closely, I see what he means. For example, notice that in the 'old' picture of the Vale, the trees are brighter and clearer looking (even if you can't see as far in the distance), and in the Icecrown comparison, the snowy edges of the zone were brighter white and clearer when closer to the player, whereas in the new one that same area looks like a dreary mess consistently as it goes into the background. <br />
<br />
While its true that Icecrown is a dreary mess in the first place and that its kind of the point of the zone, we see another example of this exact same effect in the Crystalsong comparison. Notice how the snowy mountain cliffs closer to the viewer in the old one is crisp and white and clear, and in the 'new' one it is much more toned down and muted.<br />
<br />
My armchair guess is that this was a bid to try and shoot for a gradual shift of what we see in the background compared to what we see up close, in an effort to move away from 'blocky' shifts in perception. That stuff exists for a reason though, and we gotta see the stuff around us with brightness and clarity before we can worry about the shrubs and bushes a couple miles off. The tech is very nice and cool, but it may benefit people if they're able to use their graphics settings to customize stuff, if possible.</div></div><hr />

At least start the fog way back in the distance like other games do it. Examples:<br />

You've always been able to extend it farther beyond what the Game menu has; Same goes for Camera Distance. Before Draenor, max was 7. Legion was 10. Highest allowable is 50.<br />
<br />
Same goes for Graphic settings / blood effects / and particle effects. :S</div></div><hr />

We know, we know, it's an old game. And was still bad.<br />
<br />
And this upgrade just seems to just adapt some default limiters to growing hardware performance again, rather than fixing the poorly optimized code to make better (or actually any use) of current hardware potential of 'modern' computers built after the year 2010.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not sure what you're looking at but the fog starts a lot further, hence, increasing the draw distance<br />
<br />
I think he/she means the effect of the Fog has been stretched out.<br />
<br />
Like so:<br />
<br />
http://s33.postimg.org/q15tirei3/newfoglegion.jpg (http://postimg.org/image/q15tirei3/)<br />
<br />
Which means it does indeed start closer than before, but it takes a longer distance before the whole strength covers the scene.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The game allows a far higher draw distance now than it ever did, you couldn't make it exceed its limit even with addons or scripts.<br />
The actual limit on live is just a bit higher than the options allow you to set, so scripts can increase it. In Legion, the actual limit is far higher than it used to be on live.</div></div><hr />

http://i.imgur.com/vMkMc1xl.jpg (http://imgur.com/vMkMc1x)<br />
But but it doesn't start so near. They need to start the fog further away and all would be fine. Just don't make objects in close range dull and with a blueish tint.<br />

I don't think that's the draw distance so much as it's that some of the objects and doodads that are incorrectly optimized. I've noticed my framerate tanks when I look at certain liquid surfaces or, like, braziers with new special effects.</div></div><hr />

Limited view distance and fog are not only there for technical purposes but also to simulate an atmosphere like in the real world.<br />
On a typical day real world 'view distance' is something like 10-15km.<br />
And when I can see across a whole zone and into the adjacent one in WoW, that just doesn't feel right, don't you think?<br />
<br />
Increased renderung distance for objects is nice though.</div></div><hr />

no I am not sure, but that's what the weather forecast data usually says.^^ Never seen a number bigger than 20km there.</div></div><hr />

On a typical day real world 'view distance' is something like 10-15km.<br />
And when I can see across a whole zone and into the adjacent one in WoW, that just doesn't feel right, don't you think?<br />
<br />
Increased renderung distance for objects is nice though.<br />
<br />
yeah. because I want to be reminded how much farther I am being forced to ride because I bumped my head and forgot how to summon my flying mount. <br />
<br />
Brilliant.</div></div><hr />

This would be interesting if even a shred of this was factual. Absolute conjecture</div></div><hr />

<br />
When you start talking about things like &quot;reducing vertices drawn&quot; and LoD (Level of Detail), those are indeed optimizations of the existing engine that will allow for more efficient use of current (and older) hardware. Modifying an existing engine takes a large amount of work, especially for a game as large as WoW.</div></div><hr />

This is more from server/client lag. Not so much view distance.<br />

After placing the before and after pics on separate tabs so i could compare full size images one after the other and really looking closely, I see what he means. For example, notice that in the 'old' picture of the Vale, the trees are brighter and clearer looking (even if you can't see as far in the distance), and in the Icecrown comparison, the snowy edges of the zone were brighter white and clearer when closer to the player, whereas in the new one that same area looks like a dreary mess consistently as it goes into the background. <br />
<br />
While its true that Icecrown is a dreary mess in the first place and that its kind of the point of the zone, we see another example of this exact same effect in the Crystalsong comparison. Notice how the snowy mountain cliffs closer to the viewer in the old one is crisp and white and clear, and in the 'new' one it is much more toned down and muted.<br />
<br />
My armchair guess is that this was a bid to try and shoot for a gradual shift of what we see in the background compared to what we see up close, in an effort to move away from 'blocky' shifts in perception. That stuff exists for a reason though, and we gotta see the stuff around us with brightness and clarity before we can worry about the shrubs and bushes a couple miles off. The tech is very nice and cool, but it may benefit people if they're able to use their graphics settings to customize stuff, if possible.<br />
I agree. Even though I can see the terrain further, everything looks much more muted. It feels like the fog starts 10 yards out and just dulls everything quicker. I would prefer the old compared to this new.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A good approximation for the distance to the horizon (in km) is 3.6 x sqrt(h), where (h) is height in metres above ground level. On Earth that is, not Azeroth.</div></div><hr />

If performance is that important, you wouldn't be running at Ultra settings in the first place. Increasing the maximum graphics on higher settings does nothing for the performance of those running at lower settings.</div></div><hr />

I can only imagine what this game would feel like if the graphics were up to date.

Yes, I think I'm insane in the membrane, but really hoping to get it maxed out on 3x 1080p monitors. 970 wasn't able to handle it properly.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry to tell you this, but it won't help much. I know someone with a 1080 and 4790K and he still has pretty bad FPS in some areas with quality at 10 (maxed out). <br />
WoW is just too CPU limited to make full use of such a highend GPU.<br />
Draw distance and stuff like that relies strongly on the CPU and WoW's old modified WC3-Engine is only using 2 CPU Threads unlike modern games which use at least 4.</div></div><hr />

WoW uses all 4 cores on my CPU... and your statement is incorrect, wow is not a &quot;CPU Limited&quot; game anymore. Ultra Settings all 4 of my cores use roughly 25% and the GPU uses ~40% ish. <br />
They migrated off the &quot;CPU&quot; bound part with WOD release (anyone remember the CMAA crap)<br />

<br />
With that said, the game still has to render a lot of stuff, and you will always take frame rate hits when there are tons of players around.</div></div><hr />
