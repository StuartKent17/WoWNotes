Battle.Net Website Update - Legion Preparation<br />
Blizzard made a small update to the Battle.Net website to add design elements for Legion. The Illidari Felstalker mount (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/5125-Legion-CE-Mount-Illidari-Felstalker-Darkmoon-Faire-Updates-Blue-Tweets-DLC-503) that is the reward for the Collector's Edition was added in Patch 6.2.2. No preorder date has been announced yet.<br />

Blue Posts<br />
Crithto Leaving Blizzard<br />
Honestly, yesterday was one of the most emotionally overwhelming days I've ever experienced. I had no idea I'd get the reaction I did from so many people including all of you. I spent some time last night reading your comments here and let me just say, I was moved.<br />
<br />
Your touching responses, well wishes, and encouragement mean the world to me. Not only that, but friends of mine outside our world here caught wind of it all, and you moved them to tears as well. And this isn't to inspire more sadness or posts. I just wanted each of you to know how much I appreciate what you've shared, player and co-worker alike. Thank you. Truly, truly, thank you. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/389577-what-a-long-amazing-trip-its-been/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/19136254971?page=15#283))<br />
<br />
Assault on the Pit and Draenor Flying<br />
The frustration caused by having to wait for Assault on the Pit is something I've seen a lot of over the past few weeks. I don't have any additional information at this time, but I wanted to let you know that this feedback has been forwarded on. Thanks for the feedback! (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/389670-yeahwe-continue-to-wait/) / Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/16069797548?page=2#30))<br />
<br />
Official Communication<br />
I’m going to try and tackle some of the most recurrent questions and concerns here. Bear with me!<br />
<br />
Again I want to reiterate that your feedback does get read. The tricky situation is that replying to a thread with a small “thanks, this has been forwarded on” can then set a false expectation that there will be an answer, or a change to the game, when that post appears out of context somewhere else on the internet.<br />
<br />
Likewise, after a while a simple “thanks for the feedback” in response to every thread can begin to feel just as empty as not receiving an answer at all. It may also cause people to feel more neglected than they already are, if their own topics are not replied too. Having a lot of similar replies can even make relevant answers harder to locate on the aforementioned Blue Trackers. Of course, if a topic is particularly prevalent I will endeavour to let you know that it has been heard. (for example (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/16069797548?page=2#30))<br />
<br />
I’m also not a developer, so I’m not really in a position of speculating or commenting on game design choices where the Blue text effectively causes any response posted to be viewed as Blizzard’s official stance. That being said I will try to chase up on widespread concerns and, any significant information I do get, I will try to relay to you as much as possible. Though I also want any information I provide to be as accurate as possible to avoid potential sources of confusion. This leads into:<br />
<br />
To the green - seriously? Timezone difficulties and &quot;permission-to-post&quot; issues?<br />
It’s not really a permissions issue. Of course we want to make sure that everything we post is accurate which can cause delays. Some communications are partially a timezone issue, with the developers being in the US it’s far more likely that any tweets or posts that the developers make, will be during US hours, because that’s when they’re working. Likewise it means that here in Europe, we may have to send e-mails to the developers enquire for information if our schedules don’t overlap.<br />
<br />
For all important communications, we are trying to get everything communicated at the same time in all regions via blog posts. If any localisation is needed, then that may delay the process, but the goal is for important communications to be on blogs in all regions within 24 hours.<br />
<br />
Yes, this may not have always happened in the past. We’re well aware of that and working on improving.<br />
<br />
On that note, let me pitch a question here – would you like for the Updates from @WarcraftDevs thread to be mirrored onto the EU forums so you have better visibility of it?<br />
<br />
Eu needs to get the information in all languages at the same time or the world is destroyed.<br />
This isn’t always the case either. While it is true for important announcements and updates, there are smaller, more language-specific, updates from the community that may not be posted in all languages. This is decided on a language by language basis. For example a Hearthstone tournament running in Germany, only being casted in German, would normally only be communicated to our German speaking audience as it’s of more relevance to them.<br />
<br />
And I'm simply astounded by your welcome thread and Bashiok's farewell thread, because most of those blues, I've never even seen them here or anywhere for that matter, especially not this year, AND YET - most of them bear the &quot;Community Manager&quot; title.<br />
The Blues you see in those threads are Community Managers that have individual game and languages responsibilities. For example, here in Europe we support 6 games in 5+ different languages; to break that down there is (generally) one Community Manager per language, per game. That means there are a lot of Blues you may never see outside of those types of threads, simply because they are supporting a different game/language.<br />
<br />
I have a question; as a community manager surely managing the community of the official site takes precedence over third parties i.e. twitter, youtube, fansites etc. Why is this not the case? If people have feedback to give or questions to ask surely the official forums would be the place they're most likely to come to do so.<br />
I know this isn’t going to be a popular answer, but Twitter, Facebook and YouTube (and probably more to come) are also official channels. These sites may not be directly hosted on Battle.net, but they are still official channels. The World of Warcraft community, as a whole, is very diverse and spread out more than just on the official forums. All feedback is valuable, regardless of where it comes from.<br />
<br />
To go back to an earlier point, any important information we try to communicate through the official blogs. The official Twitter and Facebook pages are generally used to highlight fun stuff the community is doing (Cosplay, Machinima, Fan-Art, etc.) as well as direct people to the official blog posts. Again, this is something we’re striving to improve on.<br />
<br />
But, and ultimately…<br />
<br />
I fully understand that you have all been feeling neglected here on the EU forums and I definitely hear that there are aspects of the game that you’re unhappy with. However, I can’t change what has happened in the past. I can only change what happens going forward. I want to go forward working together with you all, which is why I made my initial post (and this follow-up!) giving you a view of the stuff I do. The main takeaway I wanted to give from that post is that some days (maybe even weeks), I might not post all but that this isn’t because I’m ignoring you. Interacting with the community, championing your feedback and also highlighting all the great content the community makes, are all things that enticed me toward this job – it’s what I aim to do as often as I can!

2015 European Regional Finals Disqualifications<br />
This past weekend at the Road to BlizzCon 2015 European Regional Finals in Prague, two players from two different Arena teams were disqualified on the day of the tournament. This resulted in a less-than-ideal experience for everyone involved, especially the other teams in attendance. <br />
<br />
In both cases, the disqualified players were found to have been violating the Terms of Service of World of Warcraft. According to our Tournament Rules, players’ accounts must remain in good standing for the entirety of the 2015 WoW Arena World Championship. As these players’ accounts had been suspended, they were no longer in good standing, and thus disqualified from the tournament.<br />
<br />
We have performed a thorough investigation of the accounts in question, and have found overwhelming evidence indicating that both players were indeed participating in activities that rightfully resulted in their accounts being suspended. Blizzard does not publicly share details of actions taken against specific accounts, but offenses that typically result in suspension include: exploiting game mechanics, buying or selling accounts, playing another person’s account for advantage (boosting), and/or collusion with opponents.<br />
<br />
In both cases, we should have taken action much sooner, and regret that these players were not informed of their disqualified status prior to the event.<br />
<br />
We are working to improve our processes to prevent situations like this from happening again, and ensure that ineligible players are properly disqualified before tournament play commences.<br />

It can happen sometimes with players slipping through the pipes or the whole other person playing the account thing. I've seen it a few other games. But yeah the accounts were suspended prior so they should have known who was suspended and who wasn't before inviting them.</div></div><hr />

Talent trees removed entirely, VP system heavily nerfed - detached from dungeons and attached to dailies, 1 item slot removed, heavily overtuned normal raids, even less actually new dungeons and more rehashes, classic Scholomance entirely destroyed, etc., etc., etc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Funny then, because I started in mid-Wrath and MoP = the best expansion I've experienced. 14 months of SoO had stronger retention power than the first 6 months of WoD at that.<br />
<br />
So there haven't been any good expansions since WOTLK in YOUR opinion, not for a fact.</div></div><hr />

They're afraid they'd offhandedly mention something completely trivial they were planning on adding, have it be cut, and have players bitching about years later.<br />

<br />
To echo the statements of previous posters: It's Blizzcon in a month, why would they release information now? That's silly. If they did that, I know you'd just go &quot;Well there wasn't any information at Blizzcon!&quot;<br />
<br />
You know what people are like, they say anything now it'll be taken as red, even if they say...we're considering maybe thinking about doing something like this. Be patient, Legion wasn't announced that long ago.</div></div><hr />

Not presenting these ideas as content that will more than likely be in the game is probably a good way to avoid disappointing people. Stop trying to push the whole &quot;entitled community&quot; crap already. <br />
<br />
They failed to communicate the pre-expansion info in a good way and they've paid the price for it. Right now all they're doing is curling up in cotton wool because people said nasty things to them which isn't going to help anyone.</div></div><hr />

That can still happen considering all the things you just mentioned were announced at Blizzcon and were then cut between that announcement and release. Same as what has happened with WoD. I can guarantee you that they're gonna do it again at this Blizzcon and with the possibility of it being as bad as WoD's list.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, you could look at it a couple of ways - you could do a slow trickle of teasers and reveals, like a piece of concept art, or throw in a casual mention of something new into the discussion - don't bring it to a boil, but keep the heat on. <br />
<br />
What they're doing now is turning the heat off, the hype is cold. They're starting from square one later on, when they could be riding what hype they got from the Gamescon reveal, tweaking it once or twice a week with small reveals to keep it simmering. <br />
<br />
Remember the countdown timer for D3? Cheap, easy, and it kept people guessing and their attention on it. <br />
<br />
They could also use small reveals to build hype for Blizzcon itself. &quot;Check out this cool shot from a new zone in Legion - want to see more? Buy a virtual ticket for Blizzcon!&quot;<br />
<br />
It's not rocket science. They're doing Blizzcon hype, they should be throwing Legion tidbits into it. Unless they don't have much to show at Blizzcon, which is unthinkable, and I don't think is the case - if that were true...that's bad. Really bad.<br />

<br />
The blue issue is getting to ridiculous levels. The simple issue is, players want blues to interact more. Not just answer every question, but just be part of the discussion. It was like that for 10 years - the blues were as much a part of the community as players - yes, they made and responded to kitten threads, but that was fun! <br />
<br />
Now, it's rare to see one post. Yes, we get it, they're busy - maybe the problem is Blizzard got cheap and instead of hiring more people to cover all of the social media bases, they make the CMs do too much, so they don't have time to post on the forums.<br />
<br />
Or, a new policy was set, forbidding it. Which is what I suspect is the case - they post for paragraph after paragraph why they don't post anymore...but it doesnt ring true. Just say &quot;there's a new policy, you guys have to talk to each other, we can't be part of it&quot;. <br />

<br />
What they're doing now is turning the heat off, the hype is cold. They're starting from square one later on, when they could be riding what hype they got from the Gamescon reveal, tweaking it once or twice a week with small reveals to keep it simmering. <br />
<br />
Remember the countdown timer for D3? Cheap, easy, and it kept people guessing and their attention on it. <br />
<br />
They could also use small reveals to build hype for Blizzcon itself. &quot;Check out this cool shot from a new zone in Legion - want to see more? Buy a virtual ticket for Blizzcon!&quot;<br />
<br />
It's not rocket science. They're doing Blizzcon hype, they should be throwing Legion tidbits into it. Unless they don't have much to show at Blizzcon, which is unthinkable, and I don't think is the case - if that were true...that's bad. Really bad.<br />
<br />

<br />
Imagine the pitchforks if the artifact system is dumped, or they reveal a stripped down, useless version of the class halls. Which could happen.<br />
<br />
On Artifacts: &quot;Although originally we said that each spec would be getting their own Artifact with model and variants appropriate for it, we've now decided to give each class only one artifact for all their specs! That's right! All paladins get to use the Ashbringer, all Shamans get the doomhammer and etc, etc.&quot;<br />
Audience: &quot;What about the specs that use different stats? Or use DW or 1h weapons?&quot;<br />
&quot;Don't worry! Remember that stat switching system we introduced in WoD? The artifacts now use that! As for dual wielding specs and 1h weapons, our new smart artifact weapon type system ensures they switch to the right weapon type for your spec and even allow you to use two if you're an enhancement shaman and etc.&quot;<br />
Audience: &quot;What about survival hunters? And the relics for each spec?&quot;<br />
&quot;Well we feel survival hunters are actually fine as ranged and as for relics... Well you can always run more dungeons to loot the ones you need. Also we're pleased to announce that we reduced the ability system that we tied onto the artifact weapons so that it is more streamlined.&quot;<br />
<br />
On class halls: &quot;When announced we wanted the player as the leader of their new class halls however we ran into a problem with everyone being the class hall leader so instead we've changed your title to class hall garrison commander who oversees all the missions that potential 'recruits' get sent out on. Additionally we thought that rather than segregating all the classes into their own unique bases and locations, instead we're going to have a single hall on Dalaran with representatives from each class order and the 'orders table' from which you hand out the potential 'recruits' orders.&quot;<br />
Audience: &quot;What sort of rewards will we get from those recruit missions as the garrison commander?&quot;<br />
&quot;Rewards? Absolutely none! After all you're not actually doing those missions and only performing your celerical duties. Instead your recruits level up, gain gold and even rank up over the course of multiple missions and may even end up outranking you as the new class hall leader. AS for the content that you as the player get to do in the class halls, at the end of the hall should be a table with a daily objective in a contested zone on the Broken Isles within which you'll have to combat the invasionary force (elves, legion or naga, oh my) until you fill up your objective bar and return to base to claim Class hall participation points which we haven't decided what to do with yet.&quot;</div></div><hr />

I started playing during TBC just before Sunwell came out, and I think MoP was a one of the best expansion. And no, the &quot;vanilla/tbc players think it was poop&quot; thing is something you came up with, with no real proof to support it. <br />
<br />
MoP was pure gold, the things it added are so many and so good that anyone saying it was a shitty expansion is simply another of that whiny &quot;vanilla was so much better&quot; player. Seriously, 90% of the vanilla players didn't even see the end game content, but they still brag how it was good compared to now.<br />

Which things did it add exactly, outside pet battles? Enforced dailies in order to use VP, obsoleting dungeons even before they were released? Gathering 10 pieces of barely visible lake dirt with tons of other players competing for it, on daily basis, instead of doing some dungeons? It was so &quot;pure gold&quot;, that Blizzard had to single-handedly nuke panda valley and turn ex-questgivers into raid bosses, because players, like now, were leaving in droves horrified by that soulcrushing grind that awaited them at 90 for the most basic things like using VP. Now Blizzard tries doing the same with flying.<br />

That's what blue posts were saying. 2% is also exaggeration, usually 1% per talent point, and there were many talents adding those %s here and there, and that's how the character was built. That's CRPG approach.

I did type that wrong, I think in the old shadow tree it was 1 point for a 2% increase totalling 10% over five points, but alas when you added that extra point it made no difference and ended up &quot;wanding&quot; for more damage, and back in vanilla and tbc, wanding was serious business if oom, some of them hit hard.</div></div><hr />

I was usually downranking my nukes for more efficiency if I had mana problems. And for leveling/farming I was using efficient builds, like those which give more survivability, and gear which gives more Int/Spirit/mp5.

<br />
I've just started playing GW2 on the free version, and whilst it is heavily restricted and constantly wants you to &quot;upgrade&quot; all the classes are balanced, and it ultimately comes down to what you find fun to play which I think is a great strength. Level cap is 80 but within the first 6 levels you will have a good feel for it. Constant world events popping up as you run around you can just join in and get rewarded depending on your participation, you can help other people kills mobs and get xp and loot. Lore wise it will never be as deep as wow but it is definitely worth a dip.</div></div><hr />

I'm a vanilla player, and I think MoP was great. Second to Wrath. It cleaned up systems that needed big overhauls. It had a great setting, fantastic characters, beautiful art, and a nice theme. <br />
<br />
The biggest mistake of MoP was telling us Garrosh was the villain. Well, good on them for learning, because they haven't told us the villain of Legion yet.<br />
<br />
A lot of Vanilla/TBC players wear very strong rose-colored glasses. In their minds eye, they were all the perfect players. Most of them sucked. Only tiny slivers saw advanced content. I'd rather lean toward &quot;everyone sees it&quot;, which MoP did great. <br />
<br />
And I say that despite the fact that MoP was the expac I did the least raiding in due to a guild collapse.</div></div><hr />

1 quest? How about tons of similarly crappy daily quests, which were probably good 1st time, but turned old really fast? In TBC dungeons were more rewarding, so you didn't really have to dailies, which served more as gold-making aid and some stuff to do on the side rather than 2nd job.<br />

Because there were times when WoW was about to die because of bad design decisions. So developers were browsing forums and taking all the feedback in attempts to fix stuff, so in result Cata DS patch actually happened to be very good, and MoP daily madness was finally halted. And now it is this time again. WoW is crumbling into dust and if Blizzard won't do something as radical as killing those Lotus pandas, don't expect that there will be expansion after Legion. It isn't hard to understand that some people actually don't want to see WoW dead. And Blizzard really needs to wake up, deliver with Blizzcon this time and start PTR for patch 6.3.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Your fear is irrational, just as all the other &quot;WoW is dying!!!&quot; preachers.<br />
<br />
WoW, even in it's &quot;dying&quot; state, has amongst the highest Sub numbers of all the MMO's in the world.<br />
<br />
And there are MMO's who sustain on a few hundred thousand subs ; such as Ultima Online, Everquest etc...<br />
<br />
But yeah, i'm certain that bringing back irrational gearing choises, 1 spec per class viability and plain broken game mechanics (Tanking with Battle Shout, wut? Tanks not even Prot?) - will somehow dispel this &quot;primtive&quot; and &quot;Boring&quot; system which is in place.<br />
<br />
Fact is, bring back the Bosses that did Mindcontrol on everyone and let everyone have full DMG. Yeah, that sounds like a great design idea.<br />
<br />
Or maybe we should bring back the idea of having so poorly itemized gear, that you are FORCED to take it - And it's not in a logical order, nonono, it's spread all over different raids! <br />
<br />
But it gets better!!! Then, let's put in so that you get only 3-4 drops, per boss, when you have 40 people, and you have to have all of thoose people geared so you can go to the next tier of raids so you can gear up from that, to get to the next tier - And then introduce a f'cking boss to the 1% remaining, that breaks the whole idea of how many tanks you should yield - That guilds break APART, to steal each others tanks.<br />
<br />
YEAH. Let's do that, bring back this &quot;Fun&quot; and &quot;Awesome&quot; system. Please!<br />

It was just not that good, outside for that 1% of people who had the time. Just like Vanilla!<br />

Whta's exactly is oboslete about MoP dungeons compared to other expansion?<br />
<br />
<br />
It was so &quot;pure gold&quot;, that Blizzard had to single-handedly nuke panda valley and turn ex-questgivers into raid bosses, because players, like now, were leaving in droves horrified by that soulcrushing grind that awaited them at 90 for the most basic things like using VP.<br />
Lol, how deluded can you be. They nuked the valley for lore reasons, not because player were tired of doing daily quests.<br />
And the daily complain is also something greatly exagerated. The problem was only in 6.0 with the sheer amount of quest to do, later in the expansion no one had problem with it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Talent trees system wasn't collapsing in Wrath. Who said it so? Some ghost? Even Cata talent trees offered much more choices and talent possible combinations than MoP with its 729 mostly useless combinations of talents.<br />
That's it. Yes, you just proved yourself to be one of those &quot;rose-tainted glass&quot; idiots running around this forum.<br />
Cata talents were COMPLETE SHIT, the absolute culimination of cookie cutter builds. There was zero choice, ZERO. Every fire mage had the same talents, every affliction warlock had the same talent, and so on.<br />
<br />
The old system was falling apart because it was full of talents that simply increased your damage/healing/resistance (ie: Obliterate deals 10% more damage, or gain 2/3/5% more stamina), making them mandatory and reducing the personalization aspect.<br />
Also, to keep that system Blizzard should have had either:<br />
- kept adding rows every expansion, eventually running out of ideas or making every class have everything<br />
- make players complete more than one talent tree, inevitably making balancing the game a complete nightmare<br />
<br />
The second point was actually the reason behind Cata design of choosing a tree and completing it before going into another. It was not sustainable, but yeah, keep thinking otherwise.</div></div><hr />

Vanilla raider here. Pandaria was great all around except for the long wait for Draenor and even that could have been worse. The legendary cloak holidays were a nice way to keep people who were coming back to the game interested.<br />

If MoP was really as bad as you say, I don't think we would have gotten so many back for warlords. Nothing about warlords pitch was &quot;It's all the things you wished we did instead&quot; It's very much a doubling down on what worked in MoP</div></div><hr />

The biggest mistake of MoP was telling us Garrosh was the villain. Well, good on them for learning, because they haven't told us the villain of Legion yet.<br />
<br />
A lot of Vanilla/TBC players wear very strong rose-colored glasses. In their minds eye, they were all the perfect players. Most of them sucked. Only tiny slivers saw advanced content. I'd rather lean toward &quot;everyone sees it&quot;, which MoP did great. <br />
<br />
And I say that despite the fact that MoP was the expac I did the least raiding in due to a guild collapse.<br />
<br />
Well said, amen!</div></div><hr />

HAHA, dear lord, you never did Netherwind rep, did you? Hunting for eggs, 4 in the morning, cause every other person is hunting for them as well - whilst doing the same repetetive dailies, over and over - on top of the Ogrilla dailies?<br />
Read what I wrote. I wrote that dailies were aid, not scourge. I don't remember badge gear being locked behind Netherwing or Ogrila.<br />
<br />
Whta's exactly is oboslete about MoP dungeons compared to other expansion?<br />
Because MoP was the time when VP weren't yet entirely removed, but they were locked behind millions of dailies, as they were useless without reputation. New race/class were baseline expectation from expansions. Scenarios and challenge modes were just another difficulty mode for existing content (scenarios copied overworld areas, and later we had Heroic Scenarios even), most Scenarios had some super crappy mechanics (escort of super slow panda, barrel rolling, etc.), though some weren't that bad. When scenarios were robbed of all &quot;trash&quot; loot they became just that - utter boredom. That's exactly &quot;rose-tinted glasses&quot; you speak about.<br />
<br />
Lol, how deluded can you be. They nuked the valley for lore reasons, not because player were tired of doing daily quests.<br />
And the daily complain is also something greatly exagerated. The problem was only in 6.0 with the sheer amount of quest to do, later in the expansion no one had problem with it.<br />
Yeah, when they added &quot;happy island&quot; (which coincided with nuking Lotus pandas), noone had problems. Apparently there was some Barrens stuff, but Blizzard kept most of it only for 1 patch, so can't say as I didn't play during that time after daily madness.<br />
<br />
That's it. Yes, you just proved yourself to be one of those &quot;rose-tainted glass&quot; idiots running around this forum.<br />
Cata talents were COMPLETE SHIT, the absolute culimination of cookie cutter builds. There was zero choice, ZERO. Every fire mage had the same talents, every affliction warlock had the same talent, and so on.<br />
I didn't say Cata talents were good. But they were million times better than what we have from MoP till now.<br />
<br />
The old system was falling apart because it was full of talents that simply increased your damage/healing/resistance (ie: Obliterate deals 10% more damage, or gain 2/3/5% more stamina), making them mandatory and reducing the personalization aspect.<br />
That was just blue post excuse for what happened with them. There was a lot of class personalization aspect, those &quot;simple increases&quot; were fun as they directly increased combat capabilities and I could write whole book on each class back then. You were nearly &quot;classless&quot; without spending talent points, and they were like building blocks. Compare it with &quot;talents&quot; of MoP/WoD. You say it was dull, but it is exactly this which added more depth to character progression. Visiting trainer for new spells, getting new spell rank (without losing efficiency), getting grimoires for your warlock pets, etc. Compare it with current shallow model. I prefer my CRPGs not removing stats, talents, skills, etc. for the sake of Action/Arcade adrenaline-loaded crowd.</div></div><hr />

Challenge mode completely changed they way istance were played. Scenarios were easy and fast content with no mechanics at all, and yes, they were new, not just a new difficulty.<br />
New race and class is not baseline for every expansion. In fact, MoP was the first expansion to have BOTH. WoD has neither.<br />
I've got no pink googles on kid. Maybe you should remove yours, since a lot of vanilla/bc player are telling you that MoP was good, unlike what you said in your first post<br />

You're paranoic. They added Timless Isle for the same reason they added the 5.1 daily hub, the Thunder Isle in 5.2 and the revolution in the barrens in 5.3: new daily content each patch. The abc of every respctable mmorpg. Keep your complottist ideas in your closet <br />
<br />

Million time better than what we have now, in my Language, means good. And they were not, Cata talents were the wrost ever seen<br />

It wasn't an excuse. If you find fun spending point on mandatory talents that directly increase your performance without any mechanics or effort behind it, good for you. I didn't find it fun, and most of the community didn't, as I still remember the whine on the official forums during Cata.<br />
<br />
Also, you blantantly decided to ignore the rest of my argument where I explained why that system could not be mantained. But I guess that beside ranting for everything you can't do much<br />
<br />
<br />
And with this, I'm done. I don't intend to waste anymore time talking with someone so biased. Go play on provate servers or change game, leave WoW to players that actually wants to see it evolve.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Another vanilla player here. I loved MoP - great story, great setting, there were a lot of dailies, but as I wasn't raiding formally, they were great as things to do every time I logged on. I kept busy on 7 alts through the longest content drought so far, and really...other than being ready for new content, I wasn't unhappy. I was gearing up alts, running LFR, doing professions, doing PvP, I even have pet battles a try. I hunted treasures, because they were actually usable as they were account bound. I did arch, and got some good finds. <br />
<br />
That's the key to a good expansion - everyone is kept busy and happy. Raiders were happy, solo players were happy, pvp was happy (for the most part, the bots got really out of control at the end), and I could log on and pick from all kinds of content to do, every day, so it was hard to get bored. Sick of the timeless isle? Go dragon racing, or do the Isle of Thunder dailies, and do the vault, or try and get a dinosaur mount, or finish off the expansion quests in Karasang. <br />
<br />
I love this &quot;What did it have that WoD doesn't&quot; question - it had choices, and a lot of them, and it had fun - and it was enough to keep 6 million people playing through a long content drought. WoD didn't even make one quarter without people bailing.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ElDoorO</div><div class="date">2015-10-12, 06:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Mid-Wrath player here (I think I MAY have installed BC and said &quot;fuck this&quot; for whatever reason, might be because I was into another game at the time and didn't have time for both). MoP from ToT onward was reasonable. MoP from release to ToT SUCKED.<br />
14 months of SoO killed my care for raiding.<br />
I think people are just being out-right asses about MoP though. &quot;MoP sucked&quot; != &quot;100% of MoP sucked&quot;. It means that overall MoP sucked.<br />
I still can't believe people fell for the &quot;TI no flying was great therefore an *entire expansion is going to be great!&quot; line.<br />
I'm still disappointed by the lack-luster MW Monk Mastery being healing sphere's. It's just.. stupid.<br />
<br />
Raiding and LFR-wise I think it was *perfect*. I think WoD LFR sucks horribly. It's far too easy and cheats the player from the experience.<br />
The questing was &quot;ok&quot;. I think Wrath questing was *amazing*, as far as storytelling goes, and am still butt hurt about them removing Wrath Gate. I think questing was *smoother* since Cata but story has been blargh since then.<br />
<br />
WW monks were in a reasonable spot PvP wise but now they are trash.<br />
<br />
Wrath &gt;&gt;&gt; MoP&gt;&gt;WoD=Cata<br />
<br />
Just my opinion.<br />
<br />
Back when Vanilla was out, I was playing EQ I believe. I remember thinking I don't want to start another MMO, I don't have time for that.<br />
The grinds of old school MMO's were insane. WoW has *nothing* on them. And I will never go through that again.</div></div><hr />

Just because a feature is &quot;expected&quot; to be added, doesn't mean it's not a feature added.<br />
<br />
<br />
Scenarios and challenge modes were just another difficulty mode for existing content (scenarios copied overworld areas, and later we had Heroic Scenarios even),<br />
Azjol-Nerub and Ahn'kahet shared the same dungeon model and textures. Utgarde Pinnacle and Utgarde Keep had the exact same dungeon models and textures. Drak'Tharon Keep and Gun'Drak had the same dungeon textures and models. Halls of Lighting and Halls of Stone? Same dungeon models and textures. How about Trial of the Champion and Trial of the Crusader? And that's just Wrath.<br />
<br />
Now onto BC: All four Auchindoun instances (Shettek Halls, Auchenai Crypts, Shadow Labyrinth, Mana Tombs) had the exact same models and textures. All four of Zangarmarsh instances (Slave Pens, Underbog, The Steamvault and Serpentshrine Cavern) all used the same models and textures. How about Hellfire instances? Ramparts, Blood Furnace, Shattered Halls and MAgtheridon's Lair, all shared the same textures and models. Do I need to say anything about MEchanar, Botanica, Arcatraz and The Eye?<br />
<br />
<br />
most Scenarios had some super crappy mechanics (escort of super slow panda, barrel rolling, etc.),<br />
Like we didn't have quests in every single expansion and even during the vanilla game where we would have to escort a slow NPC. As for barrel rolling? That's just your opinion. I found them entertaining.<br />
<br />
<br />
I didn't say Cata talents were good. But they were million times better than what we have from MoP till now.<br />
Except they were not. With Cata talents you basically only had two options: you're 'ok', or you suck. You're 'ok' if you picked what the cookie-cutter build for your spec tells you to, and you 'suck' if you picked anything else other than what the cookie-cutter build tells you to. With MoP, you can literally pick what you want to adapt yourself to different situations. You can even change individual talents without having to respect, and without having to undo all the higher-level talent choices.<br />
<br />
<br />
That was just blue post excuse for what happened with them. There was a lot of class personalization aspect, those &quot;simple increases&quot; were fun as they directly increased combat capabilities and I could write whole book on each class back then. You were nearly &quot;classless&quot; without spending talent points, and they were like building blocks.<br />
Except the talent trees weren't supposed to be your character, but a complement to your character. I don't know what you see it as fun, but I really couldn't find anything fun at all in leveling up and going &quot;Woo-hoo! Spending this talent point adds another 1% to Haste!&quot; It was dull. They were just meaningless, unnecessary stepping stones to get to the active abilities. It was only interesting when I would get another attack. Today, though, when I reach one of the levels for a new talent, I get to actually choose something that has an immediate, meaningful impact on my gameplay.</div></div><hr />

The raids were very good, I mean, people were likening Throne of Thunder to Ulduar. The story was very good. The architecture, the zones, class balance, mechanics. Fantastic.<br />
<br />
What destroyed it for everyone? Sitting in Seige of Fucking Orgrimaar for 14 months and the insane daily grinds.<br />

If ToT was 1 month longer and Seige ended 3 months earlier, it would rank right up there as one of the better expansions. But because there is such a terrible taste in everyones mouths, it is forever condemned.</div></div><hr />

Random poster posts his own opinion as fact. News at 11.<br />
<br />
On a more serious note, though, MoP didn't &quot;suck&quot;. Sure, it had the 'drought' that was all those months of Siege of Orgrimmar, and the &quot;big bad bunch of dailies&quot; but that only lasted for the first tier. After that it was smooth sailing. And the rest of the expansion was pretty good. A new race, a new class, beautiful setting, awesome music, interesting backstory, an interesting developing storyline, etc.</div></div><hr />

A race almost nobody plays, a class nobody plays, dailies at the beginning of the xpac that nobody liked, the 2nd half the xpac was this drought you are talking about. Otherwise ya smooth sailing.

Looks like your bias is too ingrained in you to even consider the possibility that MoP had good things in it. And I'm not presenting my opinion as facts. The visuals of MoP were indeed beautiful, overall, as well as the music. As for the 'new race and class nobody plays', first, you're wrong. People do play that race and that class. They may not be as represented as the Hunters or Blood Elves, but some people do like the added race and class.<br />
<br />

Well considering it was WoD they were working on in that period and that they even said they probably wouldn't do another content patch in the gap between the last patch of MoP and WoD's release because they were working on WoD and were even unsure if they were even going to do a prelaunch event this time....

That's not how it works. When you look back and judge an expansion on its pros and cons, the gap at the end of the expansion is included. You don't blame the next expansion, that makes zero sense.

We don't speak about art assets. Scenarios were instanced part of isolated overworld locations, just with a bit different mobs. ToC was overall bad though, no excuse for that :)<br />

You're 'ok' if you picked what the cookie-cutter build for your spec tells you to, and you 'suck' if you picked anything else other than what the cookie-cutter build tells you to.

You can even change individual talents without having to respect, and without having to undo all the higher-level talent choices.<br />
That was a long debate in many threads. Point is &quot;you suck/you are ok&quot; was always coming from those who just copy-pasted guides and used them as divine scriptures instead of using their own heads. And of course they couldn't see any other build bu only rad-only build, neglecting other sides of the game (PvPing, farming, soloing, etc.) - granted it was harder to make interesting variations with Cata talents than with WotLK talents, but it was huge difference with MoP+, when you can as well not choose any talent and do mostly fine.<br />
<br />
Except the talent trees weren't supposed to be your character, but a complement to your character. I don't know what you see it as fun, but I really couldn't find anything fun at all in leveling up and going &quot;Woo-hoo! Spending this talent point adds another 1% to Haste!&quot; It was dull.

They were always fun for CRPG players. Getting new active abilities on other hand was a bit dull - it is more of a perk of Action games. Cata added heavy Arcade elements to rotation (procs for almost all classses), and MoP subverted it even more with walls of texts describing talents' &quot;procs of procs&quot;.<br />
And that's exactly what keeps people playing games like this - getting additional +1(%) here and there - be it from talents, from gear or from somewhere else. Nerfing leveling and removing talent trees made a lot of damage to character progression.</div></div><hr />
