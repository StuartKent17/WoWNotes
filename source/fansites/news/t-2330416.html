This is a brief summary of the second Overwatch panel!<br />
<br />
In-Game Cinematic Panel<br />
<br />
Teamwork: Cinematics are created as a collaboration of the IGC and the Overwatch Engine Team<br />
A whole new engine had to be built to allow creation of cinematics<br />
The team has about 25 members<br />
The team incorporates multiple Blizzard game engines<br />
<br />
<br />
Story Development<br />
<br />
Planning started early 2017, when the map didn't exist yet<br />
Characters: Junkrat and Roadhog<br />
Concept art, and the Queen's Decree was given to the team<br />
During their exile, they [Junkrat, and Roadhog] stole everything they could<br />
Choosing the place: the gate of the town<br />
The Hook: Junkrat just wants to light the fuse to blow stuff up<br />
Overwatch cinematics up to this point were very empotional<br />
The title sequence was made to feel like a fun adventure<br />
<br />
<br />
The Pitch<br />
<br />
The cinematic was pitched without a script or a storyboard<br />
The whole pitch was acted out<br />
Greenlight to continue<br />
The storyboard was very close to the final cinematic<br />
<br />
<br />
Nuts and Bolts of the Overwatch Engine<br />
<br />
Needed to be able to capture images and insert assets to the engine<br />
Buffers: images that represent data<br />
Set the Scene: TED is a light Overwatch engine used to set scenes, use the camera, add animations<br />
The effects system drove the capture<br />
The Play of the Game system and Capture system was very useful<br />
New Camera system: had to make a free movement camera<br />
Make the game engine not optimize engine by forcing quality 11<br />
Break apart the scene into assets so they can be manipulated<br />
Inserting the images to the engine<br />
The Graphics cards were not able to support Quality 11<br />
Slowed frames down to 1 FPS<br />
The cinematic took up 5 TB of space<br />
<br />
<br />
Animations<br />
<br />
The game team helps the IGC team understand the character<br />
Play of the Games give a really good insight into the character<br />
Reference is used to discover ideas, facial expressions and nuances<br />
Brad passed out during one of the takes when acting for the reference<br />
Smear Frames: makes the animation more realistic by smearing the character<br />
Makes it easier for the eye to follow, only visible in slow motion<br />
Jokes are added by animators sometimes<br />
<br />
<br />
The Engine<br />
<br />
The characters, costumes, and variations are taken from the game engine<br />
Everything that doesn't already exists in the game has to be manually made<br />
The mesh of the characters has to be improved, because cinematics have more detail<br />
A rig has to be built, which is the skeleton. This gives points of articulation<br />
Limbs: these are added separately as controls for the animatior<br />
Junkrat alone has 78 limbs and 524 controls<br />
There are multiple automated control that move controls together<br />
The face has multiple animated controls to create facial expressions<br />
Effects are hand drawn frame-by-frame<br />
All these are then added to TED for capture<br />
<br />
<br />
Art and Lighting<br />
<br />
The map was in development during the cinematic development<br />
The final map was used as a base<br />
Ambient light: simulates sunlight in the cinematic<br />
The characters could not be seen while the light was added<br />
Multiple point lights are added to make characters and items pop<br />
After lights are added, it is ran through compositing<br />
Because the payload was not used in game, which allowed to make it much more exaggerated<br />
A surprised Pachimari was added to the cinematic as an Easter egg<br />
<br />
<br />
