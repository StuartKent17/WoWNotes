<br />
Welcome to the Darkmoon Faire!<br />
Blizzard detailed the new and existing aspects of the Darkmoon Faire today. We detailed the fish heads and coaster (https://www.mmo-champion.com/content/8384-Patch-8-1-5-Live-This-Week!#dmf) earlier this year in our 8.1.5 guide.<br />
Step Right Up! Try Your Luck!<br />
A gathering of the exotic from around Azeroth (and beyond!), the Darkmoon Faire is a celebration of the wondrous and mysterious. This mist-shrouded island is a conundrum wrapped in an enigma, accessible at the beginning of each month for one week only. Don’t be shy now, don’t be bashful—step right up for a tantalizing glimpse of what Faire founder Silas Darkmoon has in store for you!<br />
<br />
New Attractions and Prizes!<br />
The Darkmoon Faire returns this Sunday, April 7 with a brand-new roller coaster ride, new balloon-themed pets, and the latest haute couture fashion accessories: severed fish heads!<br />
<br />
New: Darkmoon Faire Roller Coaster<br />
<br />
<br />
https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2019/april/thumb/dmf01.png (https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2019/april/dmf01.png)<br />
<br />
The Darkmoon Faire Roller Coaster is the longest, tallest, and fastest wooden roller coaster in Azeroth! Grip the edge of your seat as you get tossed around swerving through curves and taking terrifying plunges on this rickety track of twisting timber. There's no height requirement, so dwarves, gnomes, and goblins can ride without having to measure up.<br />
<br />
Brave riders will be granted the WHEE! (https://www.wowdb.com/spells/46668-whee) buff, which increases experience and reputation earned for one hour. The experience gain will lend itself to collecting Heritage Armor sets and for unlocking Allied Races, including the recently released Kul Tiran humans and Zandalari trolls.<br />
<br />
New: Pets<br />
<br />
<br />
https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2019/april/thumb/dmf02.png (https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2019/april/dmf02.png)<br />
<br />
Darkmoon Prize Tickets burning a hole in your pocket? For 90 tickets, Carl Goodup will sell you three new pets to commemorate your visit—the Horse Balloon (https://www.wowdb.com/items/164969-horse-balloon), Murloc Balloon (https://www.wowdb.com/items/164971-murloc-balloon), and Wolf Balloon (https://www.wowdb.com/items/164970-wolf-balloon). Just make sure to keep them away from pointy objects.<br />
<br />
New: Fashionable Fish<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Darkmoon Island offers 360 degrees of seas full of interesting finds. Cast a line and maybe you’ll reel in a Severed Crimsonscale Head (https://www.wowdb.com/items/164972-severed-crimsonscale-head) or Severed Azurefin Head (https://www.wowdb.com/items/164973-severed-azurefin-head). Wearing them is all the rage at the faire this season.<br />
<br />
When<br />
Starting on the first Sunday of each month, lasting one week.<br />
<br />
Where<br />
Darkmoon Island, accessible from portals in Elwynn Forest (Alliance) and Mulgore (Horde). You can easily reach the portals located in Elwynn Forest and Mulgore by paying a Darkmoon Faire Mystic Mage (located in Stormwind, Orgrimmar, and Dalaran) to teleport you there.<br />
<br />
Although there is no level restriction to attend the Faire, you can only travel to the island while the Darkmoon Faire is open.<br />
<br />

<br />
Fall is hemisphere specific. Quarter 3 2019, most people understand to be &quot;in the third quarter of 2019&quot;<br />
<br />
Also not everyone refers to Fall (must be an North American thing?), you guys over there are weirdos that still use imperial measurements :P</div></div><hr />

Encourage players to interact positively<br />
Support player autonomy &lt;----<br />
Focus on horizontal progression instead of vertical &lt;----<br />
Build upon previous designs<br />
Strive for the fun &lt;----<br />
&quot;<br />
<br />
Exactly what i've been talking about all along.<br />
These guys get it. GW2 ftw.<br />
<br />
Ion could learn a thing or two from them.<br />
And the WoW world-design team as well. Just take a look at the HoT expansion, or the latest WvW map. That is world design.<br />
I mean in HoT you cant even take one step without struggling to stay alive, and you have to be a freakin cherokee tracker to find your way to the place you want to go. Now that's fun.<br />
<br />
<br />
I've played a total of around two years.<br />
Vanilla, two expansions, WvW and PvP.<br />
I still still havent completed the game. I still log in every now and then, and there's new goals for me to strive for.<br />
Where in WoW you're done in a month or two, on each expansion. And that's even with all the timegating.<br />
<br />
I log in as often as i want, play as long as i want, do whatever i want, and i'm not being punished for this <br />
cause there's no mandatory &quot;incentives&quot; and min/max progression gain per/time.<br />
<br />
Leveling feels fun, for once in an MMO.<br />
You can go anywhere, explore all kinds of hidden paths and jumping puzzles, even some riddles.<br />
And progression is horizontal.<br />
<br />
And most of all, i dont need to think of my goal in order to login, cause the game is fun on it's own.<br />
Even if you're just running around for no reason. lol.<br />
<br />
<br />
The bad? The lore can be summed up in one page.<br />
Lack of collision ruined WvW right from the start, but if you accept that, you'll still have fun.<br />
If you like a strict &quot;trinity&quot; system you'll be dissapointed. For example, it's not like &quot;where's my heals noob?&quot; but more like &quot;here's your heals, go and get them&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Based on this article it's the opposite of going strong too. They talk about the super adventure festival being content that they've recently worked on, what a joke, 3 devs spent a day on it at most. <br />
Also their future plans are a big fat nothing. Some changes to make pvp more enjoyable in the long term, sure that's always good, but I'm reading this as they are about to make their final efforts to maximize gem store money, when the game goes into maintenance mode in the near future.<br />
<br />
<br />
MMO champion netizens love bashing BfA &amp; WoW in general, but man WoW has a lot of meaningful new content added every year, that's not something that GW2 had recently. The living story updates that Mo is so proud of are empty content with no replayability at all and they've really shot themselves in the foot with going all in with fractals as well as their only dungeon content, just my 2 cents.</div></div><hr />

Exactly.<br />
<br />
It's funny how critics of WoW will take anything said by for example Ion and proclaim &quot;It's Lawyer talk, he can't say it's all cupcakes and rainbows but he can't say it's shit neither!!!&quot;, but when the exact same sort of corporate speech is used by creators of games they like and enjoy, it's suddenly &quot;Oh these developers are so IN TUNE and so HONEST!!&quot;... <br />
<br />
It's really odd to see the mental gymnastics people will employ to justify what they enjoy vs what they don't.</div></div><hr />

While I love reading through the datamining, it might be best if they can get their presentation ahead first. Datamining can and has in the past given us a wrong view of what is coming. E.g. ESO will do a big blog post on design intent this week and then release their PTS the week after, giving people a clean view of what is planned and thus having us depend on datamining less (though considering how ridiculously thorough their patch notes are, it's not even needed). It would be great if Blizzard tried to come ahead of the news for their own game for once.<br />

Blizzard firing people after reporting &quot; we made tons of money this year &quot; <br />
<br />
And<br />
<br />
Arena.net firing people because they close under-dev project due to terrible financial situation<br />
<br />
Making tons of money =/= firings aren't necessary to build in other more useful areas of the company. Now, if they'd made tons of money from WoW and then fired developers from that title, there'd be cause for concern. <br />
<br />
The poking was at the people placing values into it depending on how they feel about the company and its products.</div></div><hr />

Meh, it's a private website so maybe they post about shit they care about as well rather than everything under the sun?<br />
Or they won't post news about other titles if there's news about WoW at that time?</div></div><hr />

That's true, it always comes kinda &quot;out of the blue&quot; rather than when it would make sense.<br />

<br />
Since the initial release of the original game they barely added new things to pvp, or at least things that really mattered. It's been what 7? years, in that time maybe there was a period of half a year to one year, when they seriously focused on pvp in early HoT. I'm sure they've experimented with lots of things, such as Stronghold &amp; much earlier on Courtyard, but these were ultimately failures of massive proportions. I'm fairly confident that less than 15% of the development went into pvp over the years &amp; less than half of that was content that was well received. <br />
<br />
(I'm primarily a pve player, but I have grown to like conquest in gw2 &amp; I have played it for about 2000 hours over the years. I never liked WvW very much, but the game has forced me to play it for certain tokens, so I've spent like 100-150 hours in there.)<br />
<br />
One of the main problems with Anet is that despite having so many employees they really suck at making content (quantity wise), it's like they are only playing DnD in the office for ehm science.</div></div><hr />

You are being disingenuous. We are talking about the Front pages and News. Also they do NOT have a forum for ESO since it came after they realize those forums are a waste of space and any announcements are from forum users, not from the website proper.<br />

I honestly don't expect other MMO news here. This is a Blizzard fansite that is mostly focused on WoW and as you said, the name is just a misnomer. It just feels arbitrary to randomly see GW2 news on something insignificant. We do see FFIV expansion release news I think. We haven't had news for other MMOs for a while. It was clear several years ago that they made an effort to expand to other MMOs (with more forums and more frequent news) but that obviously failed.<br />
So it really just felt arbitrary which is why I noted it. It might simply be things that catch Chaud's attention for whatever reason. It's not a problem, just felt it was worthy of a comment since it's a break in a pattern.</div></div><hr />

While I love reading through the datamining, it might be best if they can get their presentation ahead first. Datamining can and has in the past given us a wrong view of what is coming. E.g. ESO will do a big blog post on design intent this week and then release their PTS the week after, giving people a clean view of what is planned and thus having us depend on datamining less (though considering how ridiculously thorough their patch notes are, it's not even needed). It would be great if Blizzard tried to come ahead of the news for their own game for once.<br />

MMOChampion is and has always been a misnomer.<br />
And I honestly don't need MMOC to know that ESO or FF14 is competition. ESO and FF14 KNOW they are and are doing their best to keep the players WoW is losing and so I am certain Blizzard also knows and thus understands they need to put the extra effort for 8.2. If 8.2 is a dud, they are risking temporary loses to competitors becoming permanent.</div></div><hr />

I can't believe someone said GW2 is a pvp focused game. The game has no focus whatsoever. It has been in a bad state for a while because they haven't been producing enough content. Out of the lackluster content they do produce there is no replayability. It's practically on maintenance mode with a map and 2 hours of story update every 4+ months.<br />
<br />
The only thing that is actively updated and changed every week is the store. Players who do actively play defend it zealously because they're mostly whales who spend more than they would in a subscription based game.<br />
<br />
WoW is not in a good state either right now, but at least it maintains a steady (albeit low quality currently) stream of content that GW2 hasn't had for the past 2 or 3 years. Anet haven't even been working on another expansion.<br />
<br />
People are ignoring the fact that they made that post on the future of GW2 because they have basically been doing nothing but twiddling their thumbs and experimenting on failed projects while leaving GW2 in the dust. They didn't fire a load of developers for no reason.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Except none of us really know how much competition they are giving WoW. Every site you go to that claims ESO and FF have “X” number of players also add caveats that those number also include things such as alts, bots, etc. <br />
I’m not saying they aren’t competition, but to act like they are huge fompetitors when no one knows is as misleading as the article headline “ESO approaches 3 million users.” <br />
Blizzard not publishing numbers anymore isn’t a reflection of how bad/good it’s doing, it’s a reflection of how they aren’t misleading audience members. It may be bad, it may be better than people think. For sure the game is on a decline and has been for a long time. No one can deny that. The game still seems to be going strong and still has, what seems, like a large amount of people playing:</div></div><hr />

Wtfreak are you talking about? Full focus on PvP?  You obviously never played the game. The main focus is on the story. And the PvP which is amazing is an alternative form of play. Pull your head out and dont post just to look at yourself chat</div></div><hr />

It's beautiful, professions are a lot better done than WoW's, they have no world pvp while leveling so nobody bothers anyone, there's no competition for farming nodes and everyone can mine / gather, world quests add people around automatically (so no need for addons or manually searching), their reagent tab has slots for everything and is for all chars and so on.<br />
It does devalue group play in a way, but I didn't find this to be an issue. The only thing it doesn't do is make it easy for new players to take part in raids and dungeons. Best gear is crafted and most people playing it already have it. There's really no reason to bother yourself with a new player unless he's your friend and really want him to play with you.</div></div><hr />
