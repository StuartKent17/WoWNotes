<br />
They used orcs because they had nothing else.<br />
They used smoke and mirrors to make the models, because they had nothing else.<br />
They didn't have anything to make the cinematic, and only had 4 weeks prior to the announcement.<br />
They barly had any assets. <br />
<br />
So basically, they cut corners, because they HAD to cut corners. <br />
<br />
I'm impressed after listening on how well it turned out<br />
I'm upset because it could have been 10x better had they had the assets and resources they needed.<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
The WoD reveal trailer seemed pretty damn finished and awesome to me. Compare that to the OTHER trailers.<br />
<br />
In BC, they didn't even have the draenei, or even ANNOUNCE the draenei. There were no models of new creatures and no new zones other than a shot of karazhan. <br />
<br />
WotLK was two players running around a very early version of howling Fjord, with a little bit of dragonblight and borean tundra thrown in. The only new creature models are the yeti and the vrykul (which ended up being redone anyway.) The little snippet of Arthas at the end is actually a still vignette you can find in the WoW model viewer that they threw together. <br />
<br />
Cataclysm's was probably the most put-together looking. But they still didn't have Deathwing's model. <br />
<br />
People got all uppity about MoP's trailer.</div></div><hr />

Not sure what you think is happening because nothing interesting is coming for WoW players this Blizzcon.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If only something major were happening in WoWt in... oh, say, less than two weeks. <br />
<br />
I just can't think of anything.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Warlords is on the way. That is the future of WoW. Still many people are interested in the technical aspects of it. Some of it is actually pretty cool.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I know A LOT of people want news about the future of WoW/Warcraft, but I don't think they'll reveal anything this close to WoD launch.<br />
<br />
And apparently there were soooooo many expecting stuff like Warcraft 4 and/or the new expansion info, nothing was promised yet so many act like they got scammed</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaleredar</div><div class="date">2014-11-08, 10:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Smoke and mirrors will do that.<br />
<br />
I never said it was bad, I just said it could have been better. And they verified it.<br />
<br />
Compare it to the other reveal trailers. It stands up with any of them, and is pretty much objectively better than BC's.</div></div><hr />

Just let me get to 100 so I can at least make theories about the future. As of right now all we have to go on are trademarks and a boring blizzcon.</div></div><hr />

VFX is smoke and mirrors.<br />

Shirtless Khadgar made me laugh so hard omg.<br />
<br />
I'm enjoying the fact that Blizzard is giving their playerbase some much needed insight as to how development works with WoW. Seriously some great stuff for people looking to join the industry down the line, and gives some explanation to certain aspects people have been wondering about for years.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xskarma</div><div class="date">2014-11-08, 11:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Loved the panel and the honesty. I think Blizzard is very aware of how much attention and love their artwork gets and how much of a tool it can be to produce interest for their products, or hell, be products themselves. It would not surprise me at all if we see Blizzard gravitate more and more to this and put more and more of a focus on it in the future.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chickat</div><div class="date">2014-11-08, 11:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I love the art team. I would pay 1000 dollars to have a guldan style orc warlock for my lock.</div></div><hr />

<br />
All their behind the scenes DVDs have tons of documentary features about this stuff.<br />
<br />
The MoP one even has a full live action cut of the cinematic using the footage they shot for reference material.</div></div><hr />
