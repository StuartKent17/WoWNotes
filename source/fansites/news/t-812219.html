These hotfixes were intentional and we wanted to share more information about the &quot;why&quot; for you all here:<br />
<br />
Mana is supposed to matter for healers, and in the case of Holy paladins, that just wasn’t happening. We were seeing raid groups attempting to learn new bosses where the other healers were out of mana while the paladins were still at 90% of mana. We also thought the experience of paladins healing harder heroic dungeons was inconsistent with that of other healers, or our design intent. We thought it was only a matter of time before groups started going out of their way to stack paladins for raids or recruit them for dungeon runs, which of course is not our intent. For this reason, we thought it was important to address this point now rather than sitting on it until a future patch.<br />
<br />
The main culprit for the increased paladin efficiency this was Holy Power from Tower of Radiance. We were seeing a strategy develop where paladins would cast Holy Light on a Beaconed tank, and then cast Light of Dawn on the raid (and use very few other spells). This strategy was remarkably successful considering how simple it is. The Holy Power-based heals are supposed to be an important component of the paladin kit, but because Holy Light is designed to be super efficient, the overall strategy was too efficient. The intent of Tower of Radiance was to make directly healing a Beacon of Light target less punitive, but instead it was becoming the only smart way to play. You can still generate Holy Power by using Flash of Light or Divine Light on a Beaconed target, or through a variety of other ways. Remember, overall it isn’t balanced if paladins are just as mana efficient as other healers and have several mana-free spells.<br />
<br />
Light of Dawn was adjusted because it was completely eclipsing Word of Glory. We lowered the healing of Word of Glory late in development, but also redesigned Light of Dawn. They had fallen out of sync, and Light of Dawn was just too good. <br />

PvP Season 9 Has Begun!<br />
The first PvP season of World of Warcraft: Cataclysm is underway! Players are now able to compete in level-85 Rated Arenas for top gear, items, and titles -- and for the first time ever, they can enter level-85 Rated Battlegrounds to fight for the same rewards available through Arenas, along with the original World of Warcraft PvP titles. Players can also participate in unranked War Games, skirmishes that allow Battleground and Arena teams to hone their skills against opponents of their choosing -- even if they're in the same faction. So prepare yourselves, aspiring Grand Marshals and High Warlords, as the struggle between the Horde and the Alliance is about to get bloodier.</div></div><hr />

Thats how BLizzard does things when it comes to paladins. Always has - always will. Happy I desided to not play holy paladin at all cause I've seen this all before. It will not change. <br />
<br />
The two AOE healing mecanics from BLizzard were off for most of beta. They didn't listen to ppl that told them again and again that these ablites with long cd and none scaleable would really create increadable unbalance. When they finally realised it... they did it a week from live having no tests whatsoever done on it.<br />
<br />
So.. yet again. Dont blame holy paladins for how things were. It yet again BLizzard that screwed up when it came to the class.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I disagree with how they did it.<br />
<br />
First through a stealth nerf through a hotfix with no notice, even though they just brought the servers up from maintenance and patch. <br />
<br />
But mainly because they took the Holy rotation that they and players have been devolping for the last 3 months in beta, patch 4.0.1 and then through Cataclysm and tossed it out the window.<br />
<br />
Now we're back to WOTLK type healing of just spamming one heal over and over again instead of choosing the heal based on the amount of damage being taken, aoe damage, quick damage, etc.<br />
<br />
Now instead of using holy light on fast quick damage, or for a slow large hits and moving to divine light when it's quicker larger hits or flash of light when it's unexpected large hits, we're going to be using Divine light every time.<br />
<br />
There's simply no reason to waste mana on casting a Holy Light now that it takes no part in Holy Power, a huge system they designed Holy Paladins with.<br />
<br />
Instead of changing the fact that Light of dawn was transferring heals through beacon or simply increasing our mana cost to bring us in line, they throw our healing rotation out the window again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So, in essence Blizzard, you are trying to make the inefficiency of mana regen equal between all healing classes? Meaning, if these three other healing classes are blowing through mana before a fight even reaches the half way mark but paladins are able to keep up, then I guess we should change how Holy Power works, up the cost just slightly of our base healing spell which has a terrible cast time and in turn, have paladins blow through all their mana. Awesome.<br />
<br />
As a paladin healer myself, gaining Holy Power when casting HoL on my beaconed target was like a god send. I could pump out 3 heals and then use Word of Glory without having to worry about the tank getting too low on health. Now, if a fight goes into the phase where the tank is going to be taking a lot of damage, we'll have to spam FoL during the CD of HS then hit them with WoG, rinse and repeat. Do you realize how much of a mana burn that is? So then you blow all your CDs, gain some mana back and try to catch up while the other healer(s) are blowing through their mana. What's left? No healers. Wipe. That's just how I see it. A big old kick in the face, point and laugh, paladins are once again TERRIBLE.<br />
<br />
THANKS SO MUCH BLIZZTARD.</div></div><hr />

There's more to healing now than back then. The way dpsers play also affect healing. Their interrupts, stuns, CC and ability to reduce and minimize damage is -very- important for a healer to stay on top of the situation, and quite frankly I wouldn't have it any other way.</div></div><hr />

I agree with what you are saying in principle but not that you like how it is now.<br />
<br />
Yes, DPS should have to pay attention and not take as much damage - but what's going to happen if they don't? Healers just heal them up. Do you really think a DPS is going to listen to a healer that it was -their- fault they died and not the healer? You are insane if you think so.<br />
<br />
The only way this will work in practice is if Blizzard implements some type of first party Failbot system so you can say flat out look, DPS, you are the retarded one, stop being stupid or get out of here. Otherwise the healers will just keep taking the screams and stressing out healing mistakes and going oom.</div></div><hr />

I love these type of replies. Paladins were blatantly broken in the OP healing department. Paladins are bitching, complaining, and threatening to quit, reroll, OMG BLIZZ YOU BROKE US, etc and expect to remain in their current state. Why should the paladin class be entitled to be able to heal more and 2-3x as efficient as other heals and be left alone? Every other healer has to watch their heals, time everything right, and pray the group does their job appropriately or they can't heal it. Paladins I've noticed have been able to heal situations in 5 mans other heals could not even fathom controlling and still come up with 50% mana and the group alive. Blizzard finally realized this. Besides..what's easier to do? Buff 3 other healing classes to do &quot;better&quot; and go against their new healing philosophy or nerf paladins who in their state prior went completely against it?</div></div><hr />

<br />
On the contrary, the perception is now going to be that shamans are the top healers, because they're actually pretty good at it, plus they bring along a whole boatload of utility. <br />
<br />
If people decide to start stacking shaman for raids, you're going to find yourself on the heavy end of the nerf bat as well. <br />

Nerfing ToR to make HL not proc holy power makes ToR completely useless, because its' not like we're going to go around spamming our most expensive heals on the BoL target to cast WoG or LoD. If you are going to nerf ToR in this way where we will very rarely even use it, then at least buff the amount of healing BoL does to 100% instead of the 50% it currently has, and slightly buff HL to make it a stronger heal to at least make holy paladins better options for tank healing, because at this point 12k heals every two seconds clearly isn't viable for tank healing. A LoD nerf was needed, but at least revert it back to its 30 second cd. Now, with ToR nerfed to shit, the entire mechanic of holy power will be useless (unless you count using your holy power every 18 seconds to get a LoD or WoG off?).</div></div><hr />

Since when did healers have rotations? Healing is hard at the moment witch was intetnded. It wasnt hard for paladins because they had a so called &quot;Healing Rotation&quot;.

<br />
I already queue faster as a healer than a tank, i'm guessing that's because the new healing style turned off so many healers that they rerolled dps or tank. why take on the stresses of healing when you can mash your /focus CrowdControl spell every 30 seconds and your pewpew buttons between that?<br />
<br />
Holy paladins weren't immune to boss mechanics, bad groups or not going oom from spamming DL or FoL. they were ~10% more tolerant (rough approximation). I'm sure they needed a nerf and not say, a Mage (GL in s9). <br />

I can't say I disagree with the 'din nerf, their healing was ridiculous and yes we as a guild were heading towards more dins than anything else in our healing setup. Our dins were bitching tonight about this &quot;bug&quot;, which turned out to be a stealth nerf, but honestly, other healers could not even begin to compare to the efficiency and power that was paladin healing. I dunno if this nerf was the right way to do it, Uglywho really has a point there, but yeah, a nerf was absolutely inevitable.</div></div><hr />

I like most paladins saw that we were doing a lot more healing than the other healers, but expected this to be a scaling issue and that other healers would catch up in 359 gear, guess I was wrong.<br />
<br />
But still there are millions of better ways then just removing one of the most fun mechanic of the class. Not even mentioning &quot;hotfixing&quot; it without notification. Was it too much to wait until after server maintanance? Wasn't really fun seeing the mechanic not work in the middle of a raid fight and not knowing what the hell is going on. We lost quite some time trying to figure out what was going on.<br />
<br />
I must say that in regards to paladin communication Blizzard really tries to stay true to their track record of nerfing the class via stealth hotfixes and when enough people find out and the GM's have gotten the required amount of tickets they finally admit what they did. Really disappointed about this behaviour, unfortunately after 4 years its not even a surprise anymore.</div></div><hr />

The same problems happened in WOTLK, in T7 holy paladins (well almost all healers) were ridiculous, I recall just blasting holy lights with divine plea up with no real concern for anything except spamming holy light and not standing in fire. <br />
<br />
Unrelated problem that has happened again, Enh shaman scaling better with FT/FT than WF/FT, again.<br />
<br />
They make the same mistakes all the time, then they spend half the expansion balancing their mistakes again. I'd imagine given how different paladins are now, that they will not be balanced until T13. They really don't seem to know how to balance holy power at all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I disagree with how they did it.<br />
<br />
First through a stealth nerf through a hotfix with no notice, even though they just brought the servers up from maintenance and patch. <br />
<br />
But mainly because they took the Holy rotation that they and players have been devolping for the last 3 months in beta, patch 4.0.1 and then through Cataclysm and tossed it out the window.<br />
<br />
Now we're back to WOTLK type healing of just spamming one heal over and over again instead of choosing the heal based on the amount of damage being taken, aoe damage, quick damage, etc.<br />
<br />
Now instead of using holy light on fast quick damage, or for a slow large hits and moving to divine light when it's quicker larger hits or flash of light when it's unexpected large hits, we're going to be using Divine light every time.<br />
<br />
There's simply no reason to waste mana on casting a Holy Light now that it takes no part in Holy Power, a huge system they designed Holy Paladins with.<br />
<br />
Instead of changing the fact that Light of dawn was transferring heals through beacon or simply increasing our mana cost to bring us in line, they throw our healing rotation out the window again.<br />
<br />
Seriously this is such bull shit. With Cataclysm they changed the way all healers do their job and for Holy Pallys the only way to not go oom is to use Holy Light ....a lot. After we learn this new strategy to heal and we get adjusted to it, they change it during downtime with no announcement? Obviously they knew they were going to create a shitstorm so they just decided to not mention it! I thought it was bug when I logged and TRIED to heal a heroic because I thought there was no way they would take the healing method that they MADE US LEARN and then changed it to shit. What the fuck blizzard, thanks for alienating me from the class and spec I love(d).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Albireo</div><div class="date">2010-12-15, 04:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So, in essence Blizzard, you are trying to make the inefficiency of mana regen equal between all healing classes? Meaning, if these three other healing classes are blowing through mana before a fight even reaches the half way mark but paladins are able to keep up, then I guess we should change how Holy Power works, up the cost just slightly of our base healing spell which has a terrible cast time and in turn, have paladins blow through all their mana. Awesome.<br />
Welcome to the rest of the Heal-boat. Keep your hands and feet inside at all times. Paladins might want to keep away from the bitching whilst in the vicinity of Priests, Druids and Shaman. We've been dealing with it since Launch. Suck it up. We're all as broken as each other now. I'd much rather have this than one being chosen over another in a heroic/raid composition.<br />

Keep your hands and feet inside at all times. Paladins might want to keep away from the bitching whilst in the vicinity of Priests, Druids and Shaman. We've been dealing with it since Launch. Suck it up. We're all as broken as each other now. I'd much rather have this than one being chosen over another in a heroic/raid composition.<br />
<br />
I'll give it a month till we see some real changes; be it from the Healer side or the rest of the community...Season Nine should get some imbalance problems brought to light at least.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Priests have been yelling blue murder over their imbalance since approximately six-months before the Beta broke into Launch. We have still yet to hear from a blue about what is going to be done to balance out our scaling from all three specs in both PvE and PvP.<br />
<br />
Typical wrath baby logic. My class is broken, so break them too. It used to be my class is broken, so fix it. Why have things devolved so much so quickly. What you people don't get is that how Holy Paladins were working is how blizz said they wanted them to work. It isn't like someone found a glitch in the game. It isn't like someone found a loop hole. It was working as they intended it to work. Yet because other classes are broken they instead break the class they just spend months redoing. It seems to me that my holy paladin has gone back to how he was in wrath. I can see it quickly devolving into a stack as much int as humanly possible, along with haste and hope for the best. <br />
<br />
Anyone remember all of the arguments that used to occur over what was better FoL or HL builds? One was designed for fast, efficient heals. The other for big heal nukes. They geared differently, they played differently. Blizz wanted to combine those two into one class. Yet now they are essentially breaking their entire design philosophy. <br />
<br />
At least it's business as usual with all of the paladin hate on these forums. So many people want to see paladins fail, and they have no idea why. it's just the popular thing to want. <br />
<br />
No big deal for me really, I preferred healing on my druid before. I still prefer healing on my druid. If you aren't a retard you can do lots with them. So this makes two broken talent trees paladins have, who is betting on a paladin tanking nerf coming up? Doesn't matter that they are last in every category, just that they are paladin is enough to nerf them.</div></div><hr />

Even more so a spell that is slow and heals for nearly nothing. Unless they buff regen, I don't know how a holy pally would even make it through a fight with Fol, Holy Shock, WoG and Divine Light. I've been considering going prot, or main ret even, as i felt completely useless in the 4.0.1 nerf.</div></div><hr />

<br />
By whinging that &quot;light of Dawn was eclipsing word of glory&quot; just put it back to costing mana and on a dam cooldown as they had before.<br />
<br />
Instead they nerf the mechanic that was helping me tank heal and generaly not oom in standard 5man heroic bosses. Instead of 3 x 2.1k mana to get a word of glory I now (at a minimum) 6.1k x3 (flash of light - don't get me started using divine light). So I now have to use an extra 13k to get word of glory - how does that make anysense.<br />
<br />
All this will do is kill both holy light and severly reduce the use of word of glory.<br />
<br />
Good job blizz make two of my spells obsolete because the change u made to one (light of Dawn) was OP.</div></div><hr />

doing it in the middle of raid attempts/doing it without first announcing it? Man you people are retarded,<br />
you've know about the fact that paladins out heal all the other healers since the beta,<br />
fix it before things go live, you could have made that change easily enough, I swear just imagining how staff meetings go,<br />
do you lads have a big bingo basket with numbers on it that represent issues and pull out one every 20mins?<br />
<br />
I consider myself a really really good healer and I really like the fact that when an encounter ends I'm completely dry, especially if someone made a mistake somewhere among the lines that they shouldn't have. Right now, it's tuned in a way that if someone makes only one we wipe, maybe you should relook at how things are tuned now that you have scaled down the healing a lot again.<br />

We still managed to clear most of the boss which I guess means that the nerf was needed. But the problem I think is that I now I cannot generate holy power. I mean I don't understand wtf was wrong with paladins and why they needed &quot;holy powers&quot; but blizzard worked pretty hard to embed it into the class and now I can't generate any holy power.<br />
<br />
In AoE fights it's just impossible for me and not enjoyable, they say they wanted me to have options and uses different spells but effectly now my only option is to use HL to heal in AoE and people will just have to die if I can't get around to them fast enough because otherwise I'm worst then OOM. I can handle &quot;going oom&quot; and having to use different spells but right now it just feels broken and that 1 button mashing is my only option.</div></div><hr />

I think Blizzard need to re-think how they communicate with community. It might be true once a while there is a paladin having 90% mana left after a fight, but that only means one thing, he was slacking.</div></div><hr />

They said the other healers were out of mana while the paladins were still at 90%. They didn't say at the end of a fight. They meant this is happening during encounters. You even put quotations on that. :/</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ZeroWashu</div><div class="date">2010-12-15, 11:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't mind the fact that Holy Paladins needed nerfing. I understand it and I agree that they were too powerful with their ability to keep mana.<br />
<br />
I disagree with how they did it.<br />
<br />
First through a stealth nerf through a hotfix with no notice, even though they just brought the servers up from maintenance and patch. <br />
<br />
But mainly because they took the Holy rotation that they and players have been devolping for the last 3 months in beta, patch 4.0.1 and then through Cataclysm and tossed it out the window.<br />
<br />
You seem to be missing the point. Ghostcrawler has been going on and on about how you WILL heal in Catacylsm. Each time players find a method that works that violates their new model they are going to stomp it. You WILL do it their way. See, they are all so smart and all knowing and they have figured out that healers only have fun if they are stressed out. Remember how he droned on and on about how you WILL use the new slow but efficient spell? He droned endlessly that if you don't do as he says you will be wrong, to enforce it they made all the good spells so rotten in mana costs you get very little choice. I would LOL if DPS had to pay our mana costs per point of DPS.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CCloak</div><div class="date">2010-12-15, 11:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, having light of dawn heals not going back to beaconed target will work without lowering the healing numbers, that is the reason why holy light spam is sufficient to heal the tank, while also healing the group/raid, don't forget holy palladins have free self heals everytime they cast a heal.<br />
But yeah, cannot be done by a hotfix so 40% number decrease would be easier for programming.<br />
<br />
I can see holy light not getting anymore holy power, if that is meant to put palladins on par with priests, which seems to be the norm.</div></div><hr />

My main is a holy priest and it's been a real struggle since launch, I don't see why any other healing class should have an easy time and get away with it.<br />
<br />
Yes, your spells may suck all of a sudden, welcome to my world. Yes you will finally have to rethink your healing, as have priests and druids since launch (don't know about shamans, really).<br />
<br />
I actually welcome the healing changes - when was the last time you've seen a mage sheep an add or a rogue sap one? For me that was in Vanilla. Since then it's been a &quot;tank it all, aoe it all&quot; most of the time and healers were just supposed to heal through it. Those times are gone (for now anyway) and it makes running a dungeon so much more of a challenge - at least if your group actually knows that the lich king is dead and that things have changed... somehow.<br />
<br />
It's not about breaking a healing class because all the other healing classes are broken. Healing isn't broken, it was changed. Paladins aren't broken now either, they're just on par with priests and druids - finally.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">soccer84playa</div><div class="date">2010-12-15, 02:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's sad people can't learn to adapt. HoL LoD rotation is way to OP. There's still ways to gain HP and using spells depending on damage will still sustain mana better. Paladins are sitting with tons of mana in fights if using their abilities the right way so it's not going to hurt to have to adjust spell usage a little bit. Someone mentioned using FoL for heavy damage. FoL is a oh crap button for when you fell behind. If a encounter has a intense healing period there should be cool downs on tanks or raid wide cool downs being used to compensate. That doesn't mean you'll have to burn your mana with FoL. Knowing when and what spells to use is potent in raiding. DL is powerful if you're using it at the right time and don't fall behind and have to use FoL. HL is a weak filler heal that generated HP and conveniently people were using LoD because of how buffed it was for raid healing as well as a tank heal. When heavier damage comes now and you do have to use a stronger heal you'll be generating HP for those periods and will be able to use your LoD and WG faster. I have been through a large portion of the paladin nerfs and buffs for many specs and there are times we are way OP and it sucks to get nerfed but you have to live with it and L2Play with the changes. There are people in WotLK who adapted and performed very well in raids. That wont change for Catacylsm. So, instead of complaining go out there and practice new techniques to be on top of your game.<br />
<br />
edit: forgot to mention HL is a very mana efficient heal still and if the damage isn't heavy it can still be used. Although losing the ability to generate HP from it is a huge lose it still has a chance to proc no cd HS which does generate HP.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But by trying to amend this op ability they have nerfed a mechanic (holy power) that was not over powered when used with word of glory in 5/10mans.<br />
<br />
Using holy light to stack holy power and then WoG a tank is vital when mana is low. Yet this is now gone due to LoD being op.<br />
<br />
As I said before they should just make this spell cost mana and or have a significant cd not nerf a whole mechanic.<br />
<br />
To compare and help put it into persoective - if say eviscerate was hitting to hard would they nerf it by stopping the ability to get combo points for sinister strike? Of course they wouldn't as this would also affect evenom etc yet here LoD broken so they nerf the system despite it affecting other spells (WoG) which are far from op. Eh!?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Naix</div><div class="date">2010-12-15, 02:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">On the contrary, the perception is now going to be that shamans are the top healers, because they're actually pretty good at it, plus they bring along a whole boatload of utility. <br />
<br />
If people decide to start stacking shaman for raids, you're going to find yourself on the heavy end of the nerf bat as well. <br />
<br />
So go ahead, celebrate if you wish. Karma's a bitch.<br />
<br />
Blizzard has already stated that they thought Shamans were the model of healing for cataclysm. So I seriously doubt they are going to nurf Shamans healing any time soon. Shamans are the least played class for 6 years. This may get more people playing a Shaman.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jontaxe</div><div class="date">2010-12-15, 06:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I like how after a year of &quot;waaahhhh... heroics too easy, can't wait til Cata when heroics are hard again!!&quot; whining on these forums you get exactly that and now... paladins whine. God. You people have overtaken mages in the biggest bunch of bitches in the game category.<br />
<br />
Lemme clue you in as to how healing works for the rest of us in Cata (and this is coming from the supposedly &quot;Zomg OP!!&quot; shaman):<br />
<br />
If you heal DPS who pull aggro you will OOM and wipe.<br />
If you heal DPS who stand in the fire you will OOM and wipe.<br />
If you cast too many super fast heals because you let the tank get too low you will OOM and wipe.<br />
Your DPS will have to use CCs. Or, say it all with me: you will OOM and wipe.<br />
Your tank will have to use cooldowns some time in heroics, or, again, you will OOM and wipe.<br />
<br />
For those of you whining that: &quot;Healing is stressful now, zomg!!!&quot; I have to say: welcome to healing. You must have started healing in wrath. Before wrath, that's how it was. Mana was always a problem. Fights could also end when the healers went OOM instead of only goofy enrage mechanics. Or instead of the tank getting globalled. You had to... &lt;gasp&gt; triage. Things like: &quot;Well, that rogue is about to die. The boss is at X%. I am at Y mana. If I heal him, will I run OOM and wipe us when the boss is at 3%? If I don't will we have the DPS to win?&quot; And you had to make that decision in a second or two. And if you were wrong you would get blamed, not the rogue standing in the fire.<br />
<br />
It's how it was, and it's how it will become again. It's not for everyone. If you only healed in wrath, it might not be for you. If you really expect to end the fight with any mana at all, you better think again. If you don't like it, I have nothing for you except: respec.<br />
<br />
I find it fun. You might not. But it's how things are going to be for at least a couple more gear levels.</div></div><hr />

Surely there was a better option than screwing about with Holy Power generation like this? 18 seconds to generate enough Holy Power to use two of my spells unless I run in and crusader strike the boss seems a bizarre way to go. Especially since it will encourage the very playstyle of spamming one heal that Blizzard wanted to get away from. I doubt this is the end of the 'balancing' and expect further changes to all of the healing classes (of which I have one each!). I only hope they all end up in some sort of balance, since not all of us who play Holy Paladins are doing so to purely top the meters.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But seriously, if this situation were to have happened to the other healers, they would be swearing up and down that &quot;everything is broken&quot; and &quot;nothing is right&quot;. Oh - and that we, Holy Paladins, are still OP. Give us a break. Honestly, I'm not shocked to find that most of the applause comes from other healers.. they hot key 2 buttons and stare at their HPS. Yeah, we shined pretty hard core in WoTLK, ya da ya da, our time is up.. whatever the case, let's see one of you give US a reason to be jealous. Please. I'll wait. ;)</div></div><hr />
