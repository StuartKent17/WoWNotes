<br />
You won't lose them, no. You don't click to learn them like you do with Toys, it's just automatically added when you log into a character that owns them.<br />
<br />
<br />
is there any SS's of this new level 1 mount? sounds interesting<br />
<br />
<br />
It's the same model as the Mechano-hog/Mekgineer's Chopper, except it has an NPC driver (orc/human) and you sit in the sidecar.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, all that happens is that when you log into a character any existing heirlooms, with upgrades, will be &quot;unlocked&quot; in the new tab. Unlike toys nothing will be consumed.<br />
<br />
For instance: You have a Int Heirloom cloak(1-85) enchanted in your alt, in the new tab it will be unavaible to create more of it unless you log into that alt, which will identify your heirloom and unlock it with its upgrade in the tab, but the current enchanted item will remain in your inventory/bank for whenever you want to use or mail to another alt.</div></div><hr />

Is that mount surely from shop? i thought it's going to be somehow connected to HoTS. It'll actually make sense because Blizzard will make money from it... How? &quot;Buy HoTS starter package!&quot; and then you'll enjoy HoTS and buy other heroes skins! (aka. more profit!)</div></div><hr />

Fire/arcane mage buffs? I guess i'll wait til patch 6.2 ...<br />
Monks got buffs, locks got some dmg buffs(even tho they need mobility not dmg), spriests got buffs, warriors got buffs.<br />
Meanwhile only frost mages got attention(as always), arcane got pom-poly change revert only and fire lost a spell for some fckin reason and got glyph of ignite, which is some kinda bull$%^&amp; like weaker frozen ammo, that's suppose to fix how terribly bad are fire mages right now.<br />
These spells shouldnt even exist(at least in their current form):<br />
1. lvl 75 mage &quot;nova&quot; talents<br />
2. glyph of ignite<br />
3. glyph of regenerative ice<br />
4. frozen ammo<br />
5. burst of speed<br />
6. stampede<br />
7. DKs 17 trinkets( dont remove them, make them unusable under CC, so they need to be used preemptively )<br />
8. shuriken toss<br />
9. killing spree ( or at least make it some how preventable )<br />
10. skull bash mini charge ( just make it a normal melee interrupt )<br />
11. starsurge perc for 3 stacks ( mindless and retarded, makes boomkins stupid faceroll class )<br />
12. double time ( at least increase the recharge time of charge a little bit )<br />
13. spirit bond, conversion, ysera's gift ( these 3, just go away) / / empowered seals % healing and recuperate( change from % healing to scaling amount)<br />
14. force of nature ( 3 free insta roots on demand is stupid, we're not in mop anymore )<br />
15. incarnation for ferals ( just move their dmg to bleeds )<br />
16. faerie swarm ( spammable ranged slow, that doesnt let you stealth for years )<br />
17. wind shear ( longer CD, 12 sec cd is complete bull%^&amp;* )<br />
18. dots in general some of them last for over 15-20s, preventing restealthing</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;Your heirloom items will all be grandfathered into whichever group is appropriate, with previous maximum levels being upgraded. This means that if you have an heirloom item that previously maxed out at level 85, it will now max out at 90.&quot;<br />
<br />
Items grandfathered in will get a boost not a nerf.</div></div><hr />

they shouldnt - but at the same time normal brf shouldnt be tuned to 660-665 itlv min for intended audience. hell i doubt that those people will kill more then 3 bosses untill they hit 670+ or will have enough mythic friends to carry them.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
sorry to say but MoP at this stage feel much more fun and much more accesible - even without flex difficulty - hell we dont have it anymore - normal is back to old normal difficulty pre soo flex diffculty - why the fuck blizzdecided its good idea is compeltly beyond me with how much they admited in mop that constant rise of diffculty lv was a mistake.</div></div><hr />

You're mistaking *progress* for *faceroll*. If you have 7/7 Normal with mostly Normal gear, you should also have a HC piece or two from garrison, then you can go into BRF Normal without any major problems, but you'll PROGRESS on those fights. Expect 10-20-30 pulls to get the mechanics down and maybe a lucky break.<br />
My guild has ~660 average ilvl and we killed most of bosses in 1-3 tries, except Thogar and Furnace which were 9 and 12. That's NOT progress. That's faceroll.<br />
<br />
So blue explanation is nowhere near idiotic. If you're HM normal geared you'll be killing wing starter bosses for a week or two to get some gear, including maybe HC HM if that's your thing, and then after few weeks you'll be able to snatch a few wing end bosses. That's what it means to progress.<br />
<br />
Buy you want to walk in there with ilvl655 and just stroll through wings? Nope. And that's how it should be. Because again, progress. If you want to walk through wings, there's LFR.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What? Gruul was a loot pinyata. Also, you could do Normal HM &gt; Normal Brf &gt; Heroic HM. Like you said, normal BRF drops 665, while heroic HM drops 670. The only reason you're finding it harder than HM now is because we've been doing HM non stop for two months.<br />
<br />
Lastly immersion? Imperetor Mar'gok and Cho'gall most certainly more powerful lore wise than Gruul, regardless of mechanical difficulty. Heck, they're more powerful than Blackhand, who is just a dude.  You want immersion it should be BRF then HM.<br />
<br />

<br />
numberwise those fights are very similiar - at least for healers - dmg incoming is very similiar on both - i facerolled it too on 675+ toons in main raid but thats not the gear u should be doin normal in - it should be tuned for 650 max - but blizzard went away from it for whatever reason.<br />
<br />
maybe because they know that there is nothing else in game to do expet for raiding and thats why they are forcing players to &quot;progress&quot; who were never interested in progression - those players for whom flex was designed for and so prudly bragged how much succes it was - how come that it could work perfeckly in SoO and cant work at all in WoD - what caused devs to change their mind - what was the cause of 180 degree turn toward what was pre SoO. that is what interest me most.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You're saying &quot;players that can't play&quot; will leave. So from the tone of your comment it seems Blizzard should be the one fixing the situation by making content too easy, and chasing away the other part of the population who seek challenging content, instead of &quot;players who can't play&quot; putting some effort in the game they play. <br />

Something that I've wanted to say for a long time, there are guilds with disabled people in them.<br />
Last one I've found was 100% deaf guild with 3/7 Mythic progress in Highmaul. There's a reason voice comm programs are important part of raiding.<br />
There's a guild with 1/7 Mythic progress that has one 100% blind player that's being helped by audio cues and some target-of-target macros etc.<br />
These are guilds with MYTHIC progress! <br />
And then there's people who are whining they can't do Normal, or that LFR is their &quot;end game progress&quot;. How someone isn't deeply ashamed to say he, as a fully functioning person, can't do what someone who is more or less heavily impaired, is beyond me.</div></div><hr />

This means that if you have an heirloom item that previously maxed out at level 85, it will now max out at 90.&quot;<br />
<br />
Items grandfathered in will get a boost not a nerf.<br />
<br />
Of course you miss it. The 1-85 heirlooms unlock the 1-90 upgrades. The 1-80 only unlock the 1-60</div></div><hr />

I have to assume I'm just a bad player, but in a weird way it's freed me from the yoke of raiding. I understand and support the challenge that real raiders deserve. I accept Blizzard's vision for their game. It's just way, way too much for me, so I'll be personally bowing out of it and the game. Take care everyone.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah I hope so. As a total Hearthstone noob, getting eaten alive by experienced players with tons of expensive cards was about the most un-fun thing I've ever played.</div></div><hr />

<br />
maybe because they know that there is nothing else in game to do expet for raiding and thats why they are forcing players to &quot;progress&quot; who were never interested in progression - those players for whom flex was designed for and so prudly bragged how much succes it was - how come that it could work perfeckly in SoO and cant work at all in WoD - what caused devs to change their mind - what was the cause of 180 degree turn toward what was pre SoO. that is what interest me most.<br />
Do you realize that Flex is now baseline? Both Normal and Heroic are capable of flexing. And current normal difficulty is the same as the original flex difficulty when they introduced it - they moved everything down one. Heroic is technically the old normal difficulty. So normal raiding is actually easier now. Also, the players who &quot;have no interest in progression&quot; are not raiding to begin with. Raiding is progression. There is no way around it. Someone who is sincerely &quot;not interested in progression&quot; is going to do LFR and nothing above it, since that is just a tour of the content.<br />
And Gruul is incredibly easy. He is definitely the loot piñata of BRF. He is maybe harder than Heroic Kargath, but even that is a bit of a stretch. There's no way he's harder than any other Heroic Highmaul boss, though. Now, Oregorger is definitely a stupid boss, but that is due to dumb mechanics, not numbers.</div></div><hr />

Most people didnt even play during this time, let alone raiding.</div></div><hr />

I know there was one blind guy who raided, his friend guiding him on where to move and whatnot. That might be the same guy. He even has an item named after him (or his friend?) in the game, Davidian's All-Seeing Eyes, with the flavor text, &quot;Sharp enough to see for two men.&quot;<br />
<br />
EDIT: I went and checked, that was the friend's item. The blind guy's is Hexu's Amplifying Helm, with the flavor text, &quot;A man with a friend is never without vision.&quot;</div></div><hr />

So from the tone of your comment it seems Blizzard should be the one fixing the situation by making content too easy, and chasing away the other part of the population who seek challenging content, instead of &quot;players who can't play&quot; putting some effort in the game they play. <br />

This has nothing to do about a blind guy. This has to do with ppl that couldn't play from start of this expansion for many different reasons. It has nothing to do with being good or bad players - but the simple fact of decent item curve. Most players don't want to be carried trough content. And neither do they want to have to play many tiers of outdated content that most are bored of death with.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mmoc14a888ba76</div><div class="date">2015-02-08, 08:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You're mistaking *progress* for *faceroll*. If you have 7/7 Normal with mostly Normal gear, you should also have a HC piece or two from garrison, then you can go into BRF Normal without any major problems, but you'll PROGRESS on those fights. Expect 10-20-30 pulls to get the mechanics down and maybe a lucky break.<br />
My guild has ~660 average ilvl and we killed most of bosses in 1-3 tries, except Thogar and Furnace which were 9 and 12. That's NOT progress. That's faceroll.<br />
<br />
So blue explanation is nowhere near idiotic. If you're HM normal geared you'll be killing wing starter bosses for a week or two to get some gear, including maybe HC HM if that's your thing, and then after few weeks you'll be able to snatch a few wing end bosses. That's what it means to progress.<br />
<br />
Buy you want to walk in there with ilvl655 and just stroll through wings? Nope. And that's how it should be. Because again, progress. If you want to walk through wings, there's LFR.<br />
<br />
That's the first time I saw Flex being qualified as progress.. 10-30 attempts per boss? If that's true, what they did this expansion was destroy not one, but both difficulties that existed for casuals/ pugs. <br />
<br />
Not to mention, those 'heroic' gear pieces are very heavily timegated and take some investment in the table-clicking game. Same with making money for covering the repair costs for those whose guild doesn't cover those.<br />
<br />
Where does one queue for this LFR version of BRF though? I'd welcome something new to see.<br />
<br />
<br />
Most players don't want to be carried trough content. And neither do they want to have to play many tiers of outdated content that most are bored of death with. Basically. Especially not if the content is thematically the serving of oat porridge that Highmaul feels like, although opinions may vary on that.</div></div><hr />

I imagine you're being sarcastic, but LFR is coming later. They are staggering the releases. Highmaul's LFR was released later too, but it didn't seem that way since a lot of people were still in the process of leveling.</div></div><hr />

<br />
above 80% kill on hc is at 680 gear<br />
above 80% kill on normal is at 672 gear<br />
<br />
and the bosses drop 665 items on normal.<br />
So why the f. I go there if already have got the same itemlevel...<br />
<br />
BRF is a fail, beacuse this is not a new tier... the min. itemlevel for flex raids need to be 636-640.... <br />
Becuase Blizzard said at the end of MoP: flex mode will be optinal... SO WTF is this now?<br />
<br />
Nowadays people think normal raids are the base and heroic is the big progress... and they don't even think about Mythic...<br />
It's like most of the people just gave up the real heroic content... LFR-N-HC-My are just time sink, N-HC is the way...</div></div><hr />
