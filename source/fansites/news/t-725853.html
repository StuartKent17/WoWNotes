Someone pointed on the forums that I suck at my job (http://www.mmo-champion.com/showthread.php?t=725794). In an effort to unsuck, I will point out two nice interviews on GamePlanet:<br />
<br />
Ghostcrawler Interview on GamePlanet.co.nz (http://www.gameplanet.co.nz/pc/games/159702/features/135036.20100613.Blizzards-Greg-Street-on-new-systems-in-Cataclysm/)<br />
Cory Stockton Interview on GamePlanet.co.nz (http://www.gameplanet.co.nz/pc/games/159702.World-of-Warcraft-Cataclysm/features/135035.20100613.Blizzards-Cory-Stockton-on-designing-Cataclysm/)<br />
<br />
We learn a couple of new things there :<br />
Reforging will be done by NPCs in cities, it will let you reduce a secondary stat by 40% and put those points into a different stat. Secondary stats are pretty much any &quot;rating&quot; stats, you cannot reforge primary stats such as Strength, Stamina, Intellect, etc ... The cost of reforging will be the vendor cost of the item, it can be done on any item from green to purple. <br />
Heroic Shadowfang Keep and Heroic Deadmines should be shipped in Patch 4.1<br />
The CoT: War of the Ancients raid will be introduced between Patch 4.1 and 4.3<br />

Path of the Titans<br />
Path of the Titans Removal<br />
We still think it would be cool to add some kind of post-game progression to allow for player customization, but we would have to be very careful and do it right. Nobody wanted to see a feature that felt like it delivered on half its potential. Nobody wanted to be thinking about how we were going to &quot;fix the flawed Paths system&quot; in 5.0. If we can come up with a design we like, then we'll try again in the future.<br />
<br />
A big part of game design is triage -- knowing when something is good enough, knowing when something can be good with just a little more work, and knowing when something is a lost cause... at least for now. There are very few WoW features that we kill outright. Most go into a design parking lot, and we get together every few months to review those features and consider what to work on next. <br />
<br />
[...] Fortunately, one of the benefits of being Blizzard is we don't have to ship a product until we think it's ready. Our marketing department works with us on the game, but they understand that when the game is ready is ultimately up to the team. We didn't cut it because we ran out of time. We cut it because we didn't think the design we had was fun. At the high level we still like the idea, and if we can solve some of the problems we might bring it back in the future. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25399821080/you-can-t-back-out-on-path-of-the-titan-s-now/))<br />
<br />
Glyphs / Inscription<br />
Glyphs in Cataclysm<br />
Minor glyphs are fine in our opinion. They weren't intended to offer power and they are certainly much more flexible than major glyphs. Some classes need some better minor glyphs though (e.g. warlock).<br />
<br />
Medium glyphs are the kind of glyph you'd take if you had more choices. For example, a Fury warrior these days in PvE probably takes Execution, Whirlwind and Heroic Strike. Why wouldn't you? You hit all of those buttons a lot. The glyph of Cleave isn't bad, but you just don't find yourself in situations where you would use it as much as Heroic Strike, so it just never competes. If it wasn't competing with Heroic Strike though, say it was in a different category, then it might be worth considering. Bloodthirst would be an excellent medium glyph, because it is useful but doesn't contribute to dps. Medium glyphs are good for situational abilities, cooldowns, defense and utility.<br />
<br />
Now having said that, we are also taking a hard look at the major glyphs. Glyph of Sprint (movement speed) is a pretty interesting one. It is probably a dps increase given that it helps your time on target, but it's hard to put a number on that. It's very easy to put a number on Glyph of Eviscerate (crit chance). It's a math problem. That glyph is either going to be demonstrably better or worse than the other majors, leading to the cookie-cutter mentality. We already have plenty parts of the game where there really isn't a wrong choice to be made -- with enchants and meta-gems for example, there is typically a right or wrong answer given that we don't make several per spec. We do make several glyphs per spec, so we think they can be cooler. Customization was our original design for glyphs, and frankly we just didn't deliver on it. They feel like talents, and pretty simple talents at that.<br />
<br />
The challenge for us is that ALL glyphs have to follow this model. If they don't for some classes, as happened in LK, then eventually the whole thing unravels. We have a much better feel for what makes an interesting gylph now. I'm not going to promise we're going to deliver on it this time around, because we weren't able to the first time. But it is a goal and we're going to spend a lot of time on it. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25399620895/medium-glyphs-and-dps/))<br />
<br />
Non-Consumable/Learnable Glyphs in Cataclysm<br />
Making glyphs more interesting to every player is more important than making consumable glyphs a reliable money-maker for Inscription, given that there are plenty of other ways to handle the latter. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25399620895/medium-glyphs-and-dps/))<br />
<br />
Guild Talents / Leveling<br />
Guild Talents removal<br />
Guilds aren't a new feature for WoW, and we are really sensitive about imposing any kind of structure on them that might make you feel like you aren't supposed to stay with your current guildies any longer. To that end, there were flaws with guild talents that we didn't like.<br />
<br />
Guilds are, for the most part, groups of friends. We don't want features to drive wedges between them. We don't want you to guild hop looking for the talents that suit you best; we want you to play (or in many cases keep playing) with your friends. With a talent tree, guilds would naturally have different talent trees, which creates a reason to bail or guild hop that doesn't exist today. If you didn't like the direction the guild was taking (for example, you were a PvP guy with a GM focused on raid-progression) you might feel like you should leave. That can happen today of course, but you can also stay in a PvE guild just because you like the members even if you don't participate in the same content because you're not losing out on inherent guild benefits.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, we felt like the decision-making, for many guilds, would be up to a relatively few people, possibly as few as the guild master. Talent trees work for classes because the decision is up to you. We didn't want to create the risk of drama over choosing those talents or even not being consulted in choosing them.<br />
<br />
Another advantage of the perks system is that it's easily expandable. If we want to add new levels and / or perks in later patches or expansions, we can, without having to rejuggle a talent tree. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25399601135/please-rethink-the-guild-tree-and-path-removl/))<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
Interrupts in PvP<br />
We don't want interrupts to be binary either. They shouldn't be able to lock a caster down. We currently have something of an arms race where the melee got more mobility and interrupts, so the casters got more escape methods and instant spells. We just need some bilateral disarmament, so that melee can sometimes interrupt spells. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25399820831/cc-spells-and-haste/))<br />
<br />
Characters with existing PvP ranks titles<br />
The plan at the moment is to grandfather in anyone with an existing BG PvP title and just let you keep it. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25399741224/a-question-about-pvp-ranks-coming-back/))<br />
<br />
Raids &amp; Dungeons<br />
Movement in Cataclysm<br />
Movement is supposed to be a challenge in PvE. Handling the times when you have to move elegantly is one of the differences between a kill and a wipe. For Cataclysm we are making sure everyone has something they can do when mobile, whether it's Moonfire for Balance or Fel Flame for warlocks. In the same way you need to master when to AE and when to single target, you need to master when to use the mobile spells and when to not use them. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25399820831/cc-spells-and-haste/))<br />
<br />
25/10 Man Raids shared raid ID<br />
We thought the LK design was asking raiders to raid more than they wanted to. When you see a boss twice a week, you just burn out on the fight that much faster.<br />
<br />
If you really love raiding, as many of us do, bring an alt the second time around.<br />
<br />
5 Bosses in the Bastion of Twilight (Grim Batol Raid)<br />
As to the number of bosses, the 5 is just from Bastion of Twilight. There are two additional raid instances in the first tier of content and together they'll offer enough bosses for us to fully itemize, around a dozen or so. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25399741109/why-does-blizz-want-us-to-raid-less/))<br />
<br />
Archaeology<br />
Archaeology<br />
We have some end-game plans for Archaeology. I would compare it to Cooking, which isn't mandatory, but useful enough that nobody is surprised at the appearance of a Fish Feast. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25399821080/you-can-t-back-out-on-path-of-the-titan-s-now/))<br />
<br />
Archaeology rewards<br />
Many of the archaeology items are stored in your journal, not your bags, so inventory space shouldn't be a big problem. While many of the artifacts are only there for rewards, the rare finds run the gamut from unique toys to usable weapons to special pets. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25399921142/archaeology-lore-items/))<br />
<br />
Miscellaneous<br />
Spell haste in Cataclysm<br />
We're not getting rid of spell haste and I agree it's fun to get quick spells.<br />
<br />
I was talking more about the PvP environment (and to a lesser extent PvE) where the balance has shifted too heavily towards very fast or instant spells that leave the other side with no chance to predict, react or attempt to counter what you're going to do. It's a problem with CC, I'd agree, but it's also a problem with some of the really hard-hitting nukes where someone can die in a couple of GCDs before they can pop a defensive cooldown or even get healed.<br />
<br />
We want combat to be less binary, where someone can get into a wounded state and then move either towards being fully healed or being dead depending on what they and everyone else involved in the battle do. We want there to be some back and forth -- some chances to make mistakes and then recover from them. PvP can currently feel like a tennis match where the team who scores the first point wins.<br />
<br />
There still need to be moments where if you line up all your cooldowns you can kill someone who is wounded, but those need to be not every spell you cast. Given talents and gear, fully three-second cast time spells aren't really going to be that common for actual casters, but spell interactions are balanced around having a cast time so that the other side has a chance to respond. When every spell is at the GCD cap or hasted by a talent or proc then you sometimes die before you even know what happened. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25399820831/cc-spells-and-haste/))<br />
<br />
31/41/51 Points Talents<br />
We design the 31, 41 and 51-point talents to be attractive if not mandatory. There are very few builds that don't go down to the bottom of a tree and we don't think the ones that don't are in some way more interesting builds.<br />
<br />
Remember, the passive bonuses are just that -- bonuses. If you find a build that avoids 51 points in one tree but picks up something really awesome instead, you will still be fully functional. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25399821098/cata-talent-bonus-flaw-causes-lack-of-choice/))<br />
<br />
Solo players<br />
You can still choose to level up Archaeology, which is going to have quite a bit of content. We are also updating all of the other professions to make them more interesting. In addition to goblins and worgen, we have redone the questing for most of the original zones, and all of the lower-level zones. If you like solo play, you will find literally thousands of new quests. We will also offer more achievements, many of which are designed with the solo player in mind.<br />
<br />
There are also two buckets of solo players: one is the type of player who pretty much treats WoW as a single-player game and doesn't interact much with other players. The other category is the player who may have lots of friends online but doesn't feel like they have the time commitment for very organized and scheduled PvP or raiding. The new dungeons and BGs will also offer you lots of content if you are someone who plays alone but doesn't mind working together with strangers for short periods of time. The big Cataclysm feature you will miss out on as a solo player is the guild revamp. Again, if you just like to play alone but don't mind being part of a guild, you will still be able to help your guild contribute though.

<br />
Lead developers are all working on the new MMO and we're all going to die<br />
I know this is a popular sentiment among the tinfoil-hat conspiracy crowd, but it's false. We have almost the same team in place that we had for LK. We have many developers who have been working on World of Warcraft since its inception. Most of our leads have been leads for years.

Lifebloom<br />
Lifebloom is positioned as a tank-healing tool in PvE. We don't think there will be much use for using single stacks on non-tanks given how many other heals you have available that will likely do the job better. In PvE, you will likely get a 3 stack up, and then shift to Nourish to maintain the stack, throwing out Swiftmends or Healing Touch as necessary. In PvP, Lifebloom will still probably get use because of its bloom mechanic. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25399820825/2-cata-resto-druid-questions/))<br />
<br />
Tree of Life<br />
1. With the addition of the tree of life cooldown, will trees still be under the elemental heading and therefore bannishable by locks?<br />
No. You won't open yourself up to new forms of crowd control, and neither will locks or DKs using their abilities. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25399820825/2-cata-resto-druid-questions/))<br />
<br />
GC, care to comment on the ToL speed reduction returning? Snaring yourself doesnt' seem like a good design, neither in PvE nor PvP.<br />
The speed reduction thing is something we're trying again. We know it's going to be controversial and it's possible it won't stick. We really want the ability to be used at the right time, not just on cooldown. There has to be a wrong time to use it. In PvP, we want there to be a way to counter the druid, especially given that the built-in crowd control is gone. The other consideration is that we plan on getting a new model that looks more like an ancient and less like a treant, so moving slower might fit. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25399820825/2-cata-resto-druid-questions/))<br />
<br />
Will I be able to cancel ToL form after activating it, and if so will I be able to return to it before the duration is up?<br />
I imagine you can cancel it. Like all cooldowns though, if you waste it, you waste it. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25399820825/2-cata-resto-druid-questions/))<br />

Complexity of Elemental in AE Situations<br />
Yeah, I'd agree that Elemental has a lot going on for AE situations. Not all classes do though. We could add AE rotations to everyone, but I'm not sure the bang for the buck is really there when we could also just ask players to use their single target rotations more frequently.

However, one of the more interesting quotes was: &quot;Legendaries will be available in 10-player raids as well. We want this new shift in philosophy to be about a playstyle choice, not what you feel obligated to do because an item you want only comes from 10 or 25. The general idea is 'more loot, not more powerful' for 25-player raids.&quot;</div></div><hr />

It almost feels like the raids are going to be really small and just as soon as we get ramped up in the raid, it will be over with. Also with this all being the first teir it sounds like all 3 raids will be the same difficulty as apposed to one being the into the next one requiring gear from the first one and the third requiring gear from the second one.</div></div><hr />

I am really excited about Cataclysm, though I was a bit disappointed to hear about the removal of Titans path, but I guess it would turn out to be a problem.<br />
<br />
I hope the new low level quests offer better rewards than the current ones do. I gotta say I feel the quest rewards in current Azeroth is really lame. <br />
Also, 3 raids at launch is a bit little isn't it? I might be wrong but I think wotlk had 4, (if VoA was there at launch, I gotta say I can't remember) And TBC had 5 I believe. We might get another &quot;VoA&quot; on the new pvp/daily quest Isle. <br />

<br />
I don't think anyone leaves a good guild over stupid shit and the people that do are the people you don't want around anyway. My guild has 3 people left that were raiders in BC, but all the ones that are gone quit the game altogether not gone to another guild.<br />
<br />
Some guilds are hopeless to begin with, unless you give some guilds a talent to insta kill hard bosses people will still join and leave guilds ranked 8000 at record speeds no matter what.</div></div><hr />

We still think it would be cool to add some kind of post-game progression to allow for player customization, but we would have to be very careful and do it right. Nobody wanted to see a feature that felt like it delivered on half its potential.<br />
you had enough time to add some kind of post-game progression, if it's not in the game when cataclysm comes out, you failed.<br />
<br />
Glyphs in Cataclysm<br />
Minor glyphs are fine in our opinion. Some classes need some better minor glyphs though (e.g. warlock).<br />
You knew that warlock minor glyps are terrible, but you didn't do anything the entire expansion about it. How nice of you.<br />
<br />
Spell haste in Cataclysm<br />
When every spell is at the GCD cap or hasted by a talent or proc then you sometimes die before you even know what happened.<br />
nonsense, melee attacks are instant, have 0 cast time + crazy autoattack damage, thats when you die before you even know what happened. The reason why haste stacking is mandatory, is spell pushback. Btw. uninterruptible instant cast stuns can not be avoided and are more dangerous than hasted fears. World of meleecraft with instant attacks will always be &gt; casting spells and getting interrupted.</div></div><hr />

People will always switch guilds, but there was no game-related reason for it. They left because other guilds progressed faster or because they didn't like the people in their current guild, etc. With guild talents, Blizzard would introduce a game mechanic that could make people leave a guild because the GM chooses (in their opinion) the wrong talents. That is something they want to avoid. There should be no game mechanics reason to leave, so now every guild gets the same perks. Ofcourse you would still have the difference between level 1 and level 25 guilds, but I guess they think that's a minor issue.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Some enjoy soloing while their friends aren't online, or inbetween raiding.<br />
<br />
Some try to do so much as a challenge (when TBC was released i did the Paladin mount quest solo at 64). It was fun and far more difficult than the blood elf equivalent.<br />
<br />
Some just enjoy the lore and story (you'd be amazed at what little things are in quests, or i'd never have found out night elf virgins are in short supply [ashenvale - when forest song got upgraded] or that druids can be called hippies [fethermoon stronghold]).<br />
<br />
Many reasons for solo play in MMO's, the fact i play and speak to players and engage in social norms while doing my own thing is something other games can never offer from the AH to yes, even trade chat. <br />
<br />
<br />
Although i might drop out of WoW when SC2 hits, but once cata comes around then i'll be back.. worgen most likely, maybe a druid (more shapeshifting than deep space nine series) or warrior (shame no paladin worgen but they don't go well with the &quot;light&quot; as it were).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Blizzard, either on their own or with direction frm Activision has implemented the phasing out of WoW. GC's answers were soo omuch bullshit and it's SOOO apparent HE doesn't buy into his own canned responses. He's a puppet now... mouthing the words of corporate.<br />
<br />
Shifts to solo and casual playstyles, reduction of new content/mechanics, rehash of old models/zones, cancelling many core changes, sellign of pets/nounts/etc for fast cash... all leads to expectations of decreased participation/subscription.<br />
<br />
The good news is that the oNLY reason to allow/plan for WoW to deline in a controlled fashion is that the NEW MMO is fantasy based and will, for the most part, replace WoW.<br />

Why does Blizzard think they can change that. The only way to make people use glyphs they like if the glyph does not do anything relevant (like a glyph that changes the look of your polymorphed target). If a glyph adds even one point of dmg more than the other, raiders will use that one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Umm... This is a bit different to how I remember it - assuming we have an item with 100 crit and 0 hit, before they were saying you'd change that to 0 crit and 50 hit (thus lowering the overall value of the item, but customising it to your needs more), now it seems to imply that you'd change it to 50 crit and 50 hit, making the item more valuable without fail.<br />
<br />
By more valuable, I mean if I know 50 haste is worth a 1% DPS boost and 50 crit is worth only 0.7% DPS, then I'm switching some crit to haste every time... Not sure how that's going to work - surely even my BiS Tier 14 item is going to be improved by reforging a bit.<br />
<br />
I'm also assuming you can only reforge once per item... Other wise it's just an obscene money sink (well, 7 reforges at probably 25g each = 175g, and say 12 items is like 2000g off the bat for a gearset, assuming 2* value for new epics vs current ones, and only one stat needing reforging from 100) to go from 100crit/0haste to 1crit/99haste :S<br />

&quot;That sucks! I wanted my guild to be different from everyone else!&quot;<br />
&quot;Why does that matter? Shouldn't what your guild accomplishes, their name, their colors, and their level be enough of a marker of what they are? Why must your guild have reduced repair bill vs more gold dropped from raid bosses, they're both the same really.&quot;<br />
&quot;But they're different! That's why it matters!&quot;<br />
&quot;Okay, whatever.&quot;<br />
<br />
@Saitan If you want to play a single player MMO, go play Lord of the Rings Online, they have 1-man raids, I'm not even kidding either.<br />
<br />
Also, about the number of raid bosses, and the raids being released with Cata, there are 4 raids. He said Bastion of Twilight has 5, and 2 others on the first tier have 12 combined. That's 17 bosses if you can't do math. there is still one raid unaccounted for, using my awesome skills of deduction, it's probably a 2nd tier raid with more bosses outside of the 17 in the first tier. I gamble 20-30 raid bosses upon cata launch.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not what he said. He said there are other solutions to making inscription profitable, not that they don't care if Scribes make money. Maybe they plan to do the off-hand thing again, but keep it going through the whole expansion. Maybe they plan to revamp the Darkmoon card system to make a bit more reliably profitable. There's lots of things that they can do to make Inscription profitable without somehow propping up glyph sales through some artificial means.<br />
<br />
I also don't think they mean that they plan to really change the current system; but rather that the current system isn't terribly profitable, but they don't plan to do anything to &quot;fix&quot; it. I read about people making fortunes playing the Auction House with glyphs, but I don't see how. I've been trying to sell the same stacks of glyphs for weeks now. I carefully chose which glyphs to make based on reading the various class forums to find out which glyphs are particularly recommended for various class spec combination, combine with seeing which were selling for good profit. I Carefully monitored my auctions to make sure I didn't get undercut, blah, blah, blah. I've recently gone as far as just listing every glyph I'm trying to sell for 3G just to get rid of them. Doesn't seem to matter. <br />
<br />
As far as I can tell, no one buys glyphs. It occurs to me that this makes a lot of sense. The majority of people only need glyphs when they respec. Most people either don't have to, or don't want to be bothered with changing glyphs between fights. So right there you're limiting your demand. Add to that, Inscription is cheap to level and was really profitable early on, so there's lots of Scribes. I think what it comes down to is that the vast majority of people either have a Scribe, or have one in their guild; and since they hardly every need glyphs (and they're often much cheaper to make than buy), they just hit up the Guild Scribe when they need something.</div></div><hr />

He said there are other solutions to making inscription profitable, not that they don't care if Scribes make money. Maybe they plan to do the off-hand thing again, but keep it going through the whole expansion. Maybe they plan to revamp the Darkmoon card system to make a bit more reliably profitable. There's lots of things that they can do to make Inscription profitable without somehow propping up glyph sales through some artificial means.<br />
<br />
I also don't think they mean that they plan to really change the current system; but rather that the current system isn't terribly profitable, but they don't plan to do anything to &quot;fix&quot; it. I read about people making fortunes playing the Auction House with glyphs, but I don't see how. I've been trying to sell the same stacks of glyphs for weeks now. I carefully chose which glyphs to make based on reading the various class forums to find out which glyphs are particularly recommended for various class spec combination, combine with seeing which were selling for good profit. I Carefully monitored my auctions to make sure I didn't get undercut, blah, blah, blah. I've recently gone as far as just listing every glyph I'm trying to sell for 3G just to get rid of them. Doesn't seem to matter. <br />
<br />
As far as I can tell, no one buys glyphs. It occurs to me that this makes a lot of sense. The majority of people only need glyphs when they respec. Most people either don't have to, or don't want to be bothered with changing glyphs between fights. So right there you're limiting your demand. Add to that, Inscription is cheap to level and was really profitable early on, so there's lots of Scribes. I think what it comes down to is that the vast majority of people either have a Scribe, or have one in their guild; and since they hardly every need glyphs (and they're often much cheaper to make than buy), they just hit up the Guild Scribe when they need something.<br />
<br />
Sellig gylphs is insanely profitable at the moment, it's all about your competition. You're probably being undercut the instant you post them but if you can control the market (which is very hard work) you can get massive rewards. I can earn 5k gold a day but if I put the same amount of effort in with non-consumable ones i'll get an incredibly small fraction of that and as time goes by it will only decrease. As a result there's no reason to do it and no alternative. Whether you like that system or not is irrelevant really because it's the system that has been given to us and changing it only hurts players who have been dedicated and put in alot of effort towards it. You might think I'm just being greedy but since I'm not raiding at the moment I leave my game running in a window and I am constantly checking it to fight off competitors which is not only stressful but incredibly time consuming. The current system is not great but without telling us how they plan to fix it they'll just burn it into the ground and I would rather have the current system than no system at all.</div></div><hr />

People jump boards because of many reasons, such as drama or intent of going uber. To be honest I don't think a guild that chose PvE tree will gain significant edge in PvE over guilds choosing others. So a certain tree is not going to change the quality of a guild, its member does. Blizzard is talking about &quot;bringing the player...&quot; thing for years, now what?<br />
As a guild master I don't care much about the tree. But the aoe rez will be a really helpful tool for progression raids, and this idea should not die with this change of mind. <br />
Additionally, I hope there will be a raid summon function for all raid leaders. Many would agree a long summoning process could create lots of afk's in city and instance. A faster start-up of a raid will be a kick on the butt to many sloppy players, and once good habits forms, the positive influence will take a long way.</div></div><hr />

I've been irritated about some of the non-addressed issues lately, but none of these particularly bother me. I'd like more information about what they are planning on doing with Inscription (not gonna lie, it's terrible right now, only keep it because the self buffs are on par with other professions), but I can't can't realistically see it being much worse than now. If it does get much worse I'll just drop it and be on my way. I'm hoping they let Inscription make some nice offhands, there haven't been many good ones and the really good ones basically have no equal. I completely agree that guild talents would have led to serious guild hopping, and to this day I never understood what exactly PotT was going to involve, so I can't complain about it being less important.<br />

But just like always you'll buy the expansion you think sucks. You'll level til 85, then make an alt to experience all the new low level quests. You'll raid and do dungeons, paying their subscription every month. Shut the fuck up man.<br />

Don't get me wrong, this isn't a QQ I can't make money post, I make plenty of money, just not with glyphs.<br />
<br />
It really is. I play actively on an unpopulated server and the glyphs price vary heavily, one week they can go for 40g and the next for 4g. In general, the demand isn't high - I have a scribe and am usually unable to sell my glyphs even when I undercut severely. It's simply not profitable enough to waste time on making and trying to sell them. On a sidenote, the same is happening to gems since last mini patch, where gem prices fluctate heavily and cut gems sometimes cost less than uncut ones (especially red ones). One week gems can go for 220g, the next 120g. However, gems are always in high demand, as long as I keep an eye on it making a profit is much easier than with glyphs.<br />
On a different server with higher population I play, most glyphs go for ~40 gold and they do seem to sell. I keep an eye on them all the time because my lowbie alts cannot afford them there. :) I can't comment on the status of gems there since obviously I don't even have gear to socket at level 50.<br />
<br />
To be honest, I found the glyph system to be exactly how Blizzard described it: just an extra talent tree that costs a lot of gold (especially just when WOTLK released). As a warlock, I deliberately kept one minor slot open in the what now turns out to be idle hope that at least minors were gonna get a huge update with lots of crazy and interesting choices as WOTLK progressed, something that this &quot;medium glyph&quot; (new name please, that really sounds lame) hope will provide instead. However, this never happened and so every talent build had mandatory glyph X, Y and Z and replace Z by T in case you do take talent B instead of A. The only class of the 5 I played high end that felt customizable enough were resto druids - my resto druid does carry a stack of various glyphs and changes them around depending on fight, since most of their glyphs are not insanely awesome and therefore mandatory everywhere and anywhere, but also not that many are insanely stupid or underpowered or useless beyond words - that's two extremes most classes deal with. So yes I really do feel the glyph system in the end felt like a pointless and meaningless bonus of sort we cannot afford to ignore but also mostly doesn't add much to the game for most cases (except said resto druid, which, on the other hand, only really applies to 10man since in 25 it's mostly rejuv+WGspam+beer&amp;footballmatch-afk).<br />
<br />
I'm disappointed Path of the Titans went, I never quite understood exactly how I should imagine how it would work, which made it all the more exciting. &quot;Medium glyphs&quot; on the other hand just sounds the way the glyph system was intended in the first place, a bandage fix and a big hassle with no real progression unlike Path promised us - just click and select the least horrible ones and get a scribe to erase one or two every 2 months. Nevertheless, I can't be negative, will just have to see how it works out and hopefully the 'medium glyphs&quot; won't be &quot;+10% damage on Eye of Kilrogg&quot; but &quot;gives your Eye of Kilrogg huge teeth and the /nibble emote&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Furthermore, we felt like the decision-making, for many guilds, would be up to a relatively few people, possibly as few as the guild master. Talent trees work for classes because the decision is up to you. We didn't want to create the risk of drama over choosing those talents or even not being consulted in choosing them.<br />
This method was successful in Warhammer. I was co-lead of one of the largest and most successful guilds at launch and was with the game long enough to see our guild reach level 25. Every single level we gained, we talked, as a guild, about what the next point would go into. Sometimes we would talk the day before if we thought a lot of people wouldn't be online or we'd wait until there were.<br />
Sadly, due to the major differences in the communities, Blizzard has to &quot;babysit&quot; us and implement it as a perks system instead. Most guilds would handle guild talents responsibly, but for every guild that did, you can be sure almost as many would not.<br />
As a casual &quot;virtual world designer&quot; (meaning I don't get paid and no one will ever see my worlds /cry), I would have done it slightly different. Make the guild talents something semi-fluff. Extra gold off boss kills, faster rep gains, cheaper reagent costs, etc. However, also include the perks like they've mentioned. Make the perks that &quot;ooh aah&quot; talents that they had originally planned (no I don't know what they were beyond what was shown/mentioned at BlizzCon last year). Not saying Blizz is messing it up, just that in this casual designer's opinion, that would have given the best of both worlds. :p<br />
<br />
Raids &amp; Dungeons<br />
Movement in Cataclysm<br />
Movement is supposed to be a challenge in PvE. Handling the times when you have to move elegantly is one of the differences between a kill and a wipe. For Cataclysm we are making sure everyone has something they can do when mobile, whether it's Moonfire for Balance or Fel Flame for warlocks. In the same way you need to master when to AE and when to single target, you need to master when to use the mobile spells and when to not use them. <br />
After reading this, I can look at the Halion fight in Ruby Sanctum and see the direction they're moving (hurhur punny) with movement in raid encounters. I can't speak for others, but I'm pretty damn excited. :D<br />
<br />
The only question I'm left with, which is not terribly important, is this: For people with personal guilds (no one in it except yourself), will it still be possible to level that guild? Obviously it would not be even remotely as fast as a normal guild with a 10+ person roster, but will it be possible at all?</div></div><hr />

The cost of reforging will be the vendor cost of the item, it can be done on any item from green to purple.&quot;<br />
<br />
Well, I totally called that one. With the way Blizz has been dumping all of the big things they have been trumpeting about, I'm not at all surprised to see that Reforging is being shifted from the hands of the crafters to NPCs. I've got mixed feelings on this -- now it'll allow people to reforge their gear without have to track down a blacksmith or leatherworker or tailor every time they want it done, but on the downside, that's a real loss for people who are trying to make a profit from these professions. <br />

World of meleecraft with instant attacks will always be &gt; casting spells and getting interrupted.<br />
<br />
I would have to agree with the warlock minor glyphs as well as the spell interupts and pushbacks. If they don't want to have pushback on melee, perhaps blizz should look into a melee's attack damage being reduced proportionately to the number of people wailing on him/her. Example: One person beating on melee, 5 percent reduction, 2 = 10% reduction, 3 = 15% etc. If a spell can suffer pushback, why should a melee's strike equal 100% or normal damage while the melee has people beating on them.</div></div><hr />

Yes, because all guilds that aren't server first have sucky players. It couldn't possibly be that they simply don't have the time to dedicate to raiding. I know, I know...raiding only takes one night a week 4 hours a night or something like that, but the truth is some of us don't have time to progress because we have actual life commitments.</div></div><hr />

We thought the LK design was asking raiders to raid more than they wanted to. When you see a boss twice a week, you just burn out on the fight that much faster.<br />
<br />
If you really love raiding, as many of us do, bring an alt the second time around.<br />
<br />
<br />
How is bringing an alt going to make you stop seeing the same boss more than once a week?<br />

<br />
i agree, reforging was going to make my tailoring actually make some money for a change, too many professions are useless in terms of money making, and reforging was potentially going to fix that, clearly this change completely screws over many professions again just like going from BC to Wrath did. <br />
<br />
i think removing the PotT system wasn't needed, it was gonna be a snazzy little thing to do when we were bored. now it's merely a dream. removing the guild talent system is 50/50 if it went live most people would handle it properly, and others would not, blizzard has done the lesser of 2 evils here with this.<br />
<br />
but the guild experience system is frustrating due to the fact a lot of people take a while to fit into guilds and so fourth could be annoying quickly, i still think regardless, if you lose your rep every time you join a new guild, asshole officers and Guildmasters will turn kicking people into a fun little game, which is very annoying and I'm sure people would agree with this.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Clever of him to say we have almost the same design team we had for lich king, instead of saying we hardly have a single member of the burning crusade team left, or the vanilla team for that matter. Tinfoil hat is part of the &quot;applying to ridicule fallacy&quot; or saying something ridiculous to get people to laugh at it, in effect making it laughable in attempt to silence the discussion.</div></div><hr />

Very likely. Also Blizzard failed at commenting that news. But bear with me for a moment.<br />
I am proud owner of almost all classes, all leveled to 80 and such. But with WotLK access to raids i just found out<br />
i cant run them all and i had to select main (few &quot;submains&quot; and few chars played less or more) which is not fun, and it was very stressful having to raid with 1 char same instance twice a week to even maintain contact with main raid force. People whined and turned down WoW (aka canceling their subs) becouse they felt burnout. I think Blizz is trying to solve that, even if that means you are locked to 1 raid per week, be it 10m or 25m.</div></div><hr />

More like many a guild will return to the way things were, you fought bosses only once before lockout. Hopefully this will slow people down so we won't have the same situation we had waiting for 3.1<br />
<br />
The 25 -&gt; 10 conversion sounds like a brilliant idea, I know on many an occassion where 1-2 players have not shown up and we've been stuck with a 22 man raid. Forcing us to either cancel altogether or *cringe* pug some people.</div></div><hr />
