Warlords of Draenor - Creeping Carpet and Dustmane Direwolf<br />
Today we are taking a look at two of the mounts you can craft in Warlords of Draenor, the Creeping Carpet (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/169952-creeping-carpet) and Dustmane Direwolf (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/171844-dustmane-direwolf).<br />
<br />
The Creeping Carpet (http://www.wowdb.com/items/115363-creeping-carpet) can be crafted by tailors. It requires 100 x Hexweave Cloth (http://www.wowdb.com/items/111556-hexweave-cloth), which is a daily cooldown that makes 10 per day at max Tailoring skill. The Tailoring Emporium (http://beta.wowdb.com/garrison/buildings/128-tailoring-emporium) can help to produce additional cloth. It also requires 20 x Sorcerous Air (http://www.wowdb.com/items/113264-sorcerous-air). <br />
<br />
The Riding Harness (http://www.wowdb.com/items/108883-riding-harness) works in a similar way, requiring 100 x Burnished Leather (http://www.wowdb.com/items/110611-burnished-leather) and 20 x Sorcerous Air (http://www.wowdb.com/items/113264-sorcerous-air). <br />

Behind the Scenes of Lords of War<br />
Blizzard released some nice background information about the Lords of War series.<br />
As we completed our Lords of War video series, Blizzard creative developers sat down to discuss the project and document the process of bringing the epic stories of Draenor’s most savage warlords to light. We hope you enjoy these behind-the-scenes extras:<br />

7 Day Game Time Promotion Emails<br />
From time to time we run different promotional offers for a subset of players, but they’re generally not something offered to everyone. Which is why this may work on the accounts that were offered the promotion, and not others. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/346632-regarding-7-day-promotion-emails/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/15006760747?page=1#1))<br />

Raid Progress on The Armory<br />
As you already noticed, the Raid Progress feature has been removed from the Armory for now. This is not a bug, it was intended as we decided to rework the feature, so don’t worry, it’s just a matter of time before it will return (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/346524-why-oh-why/) / Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/12534713394?page=1#6))<br />

Someone getting 'more love' as you put it doesn't really affect you in a negative way so try to be a nicer person, will take you a long way in life.<br />

<br />
that creeping carpet has an awesome design. Don't see how a flat carpet can have a &quot;new model&quot; except for a different skin but yeah i agree it doesn't exactly scream &quot;creeping&quot; much though. <br />

Maybe if the corner balls were skeletal corpse hands or skulls it would.</div></div><hr />

Well you craft the harness, since it's magical it probably just pulls some poor unwitting wolf out of elsewhere in existence for your purposes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
TBH, what can be done with a carpet that flies? <br />
<br />
In terms of tailoring, though, what about a magic sail, for a small sailboat that magically flies, or a hand held magical cloth balloon (could even sit on a balloon, tbh, to use the mount animation), or a patchwork drake, or even the &quot;Flying Thunder (Cloth) Bolt&quot;!!</div></div><hr />

What mmo-champion hasn't posted is the whole 30+ minute run of Grimrail Depot. It's on the official site's main page as well as on the Polaris channel on youtube. It might help to have some context for some of the scenes in the animated short.</div></div><hr />

This is EXACTLY how I feel. I'm paying a monthly subscription for CONTENT. <br />
That means I expect the content to be in the game, not someplace else I have to pay yet more money for.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Maybe if the corner balls were skeletal corpse hands or skulls it would.<br />
<br />
It's called a Creeping carpet because it is a GROUND MOUNT only. It creeps along the ground....</div></div><hr />

Sadly its a recolor. I'll grab it cause Tailor/mount collector etc, but I always disliked the ride animation over ground travel with the Carpets. Oh well. Better than a Dragon that has huge wings that runs on the ground instead. Its like a bad D&amp;D campaign, I could stay in the sky and kill you PCs, but instead I'll land and stop using my advantages.</div></div><hr />

I can read, but no carpet ever has been a ground mount only. And all carpets should fly outside WOD.<br />
Thus, logic skill skipped most of you.</div></div><hr />

Seems like reality has skipped you. The thing is called a CREEPING carpet because it only creeps along the ground. Just because all previous carpets were flying doesn't mean this one is. Look at all of the carpets, the previous ones say flying carpet. This one does not, it says this is a ground mount. You may be able to read but comprehending what you read seems to be a different story.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In terms of tailoring, though, what about a magic sail, for a small sailboat that magically flies, or a hand held magical cloth balloon (could even sit on a balloon, tbh, to use the mount animation), or a patchwork drake, or even the &quot;Flying Thunder (Cloth) Bolt&quot;!!<br />
<br />
I can't believe that you got to sail and magic flying balloon without thinking tailored parasol/umbrella.<br />

^lol this. I always see people complain about the lore not being explained in game. A lot of it is but of course it all isn't. The WoW lore is so massive at this point there is really only so much they can put in without it being shoehorned in.<br />
<br />
There is a bunch of stuff they explain in game but people always gloss over it. My belief has always been if you truly cared about the story you would read up more on it. WoW is the bare minimum. If you want more you are gonna have to go to outside sources. That's just the way it is. it's like comparing a book to a movie. Some stuff just can't make it in due to time constraints.</div></div><hr />

<br />
-make it a 2-seater<br />
-have players actually sit on it (preferably cross-legged) instead of standing<br />
-make a new mount that is anything other than another reskinned carpet<br />
<br />
Just a few ideas.<br />
