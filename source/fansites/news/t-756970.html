Cataclysm Pets - Armadillo and Seagull<br />
2 Companion pets have been added to the game in the latest beta build, the Rutsberg Seagull (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/89472/) and the Armadillo (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/89670/). The texture on the armadillo seems to be a little low res but keep in mind that the pet is fairly small. <br />

<br />
LVL 85 Dungeons too hard?<br />
It's not quite that extreme. The problem currently is that some players are tackling Uldum or Twilight Highlands in level 83 gear, or worse, their LK epics (just had to throw that in there :) ). You will probably want a good mix of level 84 and 85 gear before doing the level 85 dungeons, and certainly the heroics. Eloderung says that he or she now has a decent mix of dungeon gear so the quest gear issue should be skewing things less. There are still overtuned or undertuned bosses and abilities for us to contend with though. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26725672943/lvl85-h-paladin-numbers-abilities-thread/))<br />
<br />
6% vs. 10% spellpower in Cataclysm<br />
The 10% spell power isn't offered by a ton of specs (nor are there any other specs that we want to add it to), but the buff makes a really big difference to casters. The 6% buff is there so we could make sure you weren't totally without any kind of buff if you lacked one of the 10% guys. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26723613865/6-vs-10-spellpower-in-cata/))<br />
<br />
Mastery Stat<br />
Well, they are shiny and new and pretty much give you exactly what you want, so that response isn't too surprising. It's good that mastery is attractive and fun. We just don't want non-mastery gear to be viewed as junk the way some classes view some stats on Live. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26725672943/lvl85-h-paladin-numbers-abilities-thread/))<br />
<br />
Spamming the same spell<br />
Right. It's a skill curve thing. If there is a right time to use something and a big penalty for doing something at the wrong time, then there is a bigger difference between good and less good players. If you can pretty much do something whenever, then there is less to learn about your class, less to perfect and ultimately less reward in investing in understanding the character. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26725672943/lvl85-h-paladin-numbers-abilities-thread/))<br />

http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ipaladins.gif Paladin (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/273-Paladin) / 3.3.5 Talent Calculator (http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?paladin#,,12213) / Cataclysm Talent Calculator (http://www.wowtal.com/#k=..paladin) / Beta Skills/Talents (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/1670-Paladin-Cataclysm))<br />
Holy Light / Flash of Light spamming<br />
We just don't agree that it worked. What generally happened was either the set bonuses, glyphs and librams all aligned to make either Flash of Light the best spell or Holy Light. In rare cases we got lucky and paladins could choose to gear either for a FoL or HL spam, but they were still choosing one spell over the other. They really weren't using a particular spell for a particular job, so the toolbox felt small and they were hitting the same buttons all the time.<br />
<br />
I can almost promise you that a Holy paladin in Cataclysm will use Holy Shock, Word of Glory, Flash of Light, Holy Light, Divine Light, Holy Radiance and Light of Dawn on every challenging dungeon or raid run. That sounds a lot more fun than spamming Holy Light with the occasional Holy Shock on cooldown. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26726014169/paladin-holy-changes-in-cataclysm/))<br />
<br />
Mana costs<br />
Mana needs to matter more. Ret (and Prot) generally need to be able to hit all of &quot;their&quot; buttons without being resource constrained, but then should only have enough mana to situationally use things like Holy Light, Exorcism or (untalented) Consecrate.<br />
<br />
It's fine to cast one Exorcism at range to pull or something, but it's not something we generally want you doing outside of Art of War procs. We're pretty reluctant to put a cooldown back on the spell though. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26725723300/feedback-paladin/))<br />
<br />
AE Healing<br />
We just don't believe the healing situation and the AE healing situation in particular is as dire as many of you are suggesting. We balance the encounters around the class capabilities, so if many groups are struggling on certain ones, those will be adjusted accordingly. We generally don't give classes new abilities because they have trouble on certain fights. If you're finding that you are just constantly behind the curve on every encounter, even the trash, then you are probably doing something wrong (attempting these dungeons undergeared is something we are seeing a lot) or your class has some kind of systemic bug that is affecting all of the healing you do.<br />
<br />
Overall, the dungeons probably will end up more challenging than they were in Lich King. Even if we eventually end up with 10 minute chain pulling 5-player dungeons in Deathwing gear, there is no need to start out that way. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26560850176/my-holy-paladin-feedback/))<br />
<br />
Holy Mastery<br />
Incidentally, we looked at mastery for Holy paladins today and decided we were happy, for now, with the power it offers, so reforge away if you think that makes you more powerful. We might always tweak things in the future. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26725672943/lvl85-h-paladin-numbers-abilities-thread/))<br />
<br />
Changing Light of Dawn to only use Holy Power<br />
We thought about a similar implementation a lot, but just worried that would make Light of Dawn harder to use. With a long cooldown, you at least can save it until you think you need it. Sitting on 3 Holy Power (and being unable to use Word of Glory during that time) might be brutal. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26725672943/lvl85-h-paladin-numbers-abilities-thread/))<br />
<br />
Haste/Crit/Overhealing in Cataclysm<br />
That's an interesting perspective. Typically LK paladins tell us that they like haste because it lets them get a heal out *right now* before a tank dies, but don't like crit because it often overheals. To use a tired cliche, it did feel a lot like Whack-a-mole because you needed to heal ASAP but how hard you healed someone wasn't nearly as important. FoL could often bring someone to full and a HL crit would be tons of overhealing. (I am talking only about the stats in how they affect healing per se, not extra effects like Illumination.) In Cataclysm you won't overheal as much (making the free healing from crits more useful) but you won't be in constant fear of the tank dying in one GCD (making haste less useful). (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26725672943/lvl85-h-paladin-numbers-abilities-thread/))<br />

Secondary effect on Heroic Leap<br />
Adding a secondary effect to Heroic Leap, like a Thunder Clap or letting you get out of roots might be a good role for a glyph. We don't like to glyph new high level abilities immediately because then players don't appreciate what the glyph does for them, since they have never used the ability unglyphed. It's something we could consider for a future patch. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26560867318/new-warrior-discussion-build-12857/))</div></div><hr />

What blizzard has done is basically compressed the usual 7 zones per expansion into 5 zones. What this has done is to put it in wrath terms is you go from Borean Tundra/Howling Fjord (Vashjir/hyjal) straight to Icecrown/storm peaks (Deepholm/twilight Highlands). There is no middle leveling spot. <br />
<br />
So you go from pretty easy mobs in the zone to stuff that damn near one shots you. <br />
<br />
You need to factor in the LFD tool as you level to gain access to the items you need to do the higher end leveling zones. Jumping striaght into a level 84-85 zone in your level 80 epics isn't going to work. That why people think its hard. They undergear the zone. something people are not used to.</div></div><hr />

Seems to be some rather clueless Puggers then - if you watch TotalBiscuits video, he feels let down by the trash (CC the healer and they are pie, don't CC the healer and wipe) and the bosses too. They partly 4 manned Vortex Pinnacle (in a guild run and in appropriate gear)</div></div><hr />

Oh no no no. Right now the path is like this: Hyjal &gt; Vashj'ir (or opposite) &gt; Deepholme &gt; Uldum &gt; Twilight Highlands. And you have to do all quests in every zone (well, you will probably ding 85 before ending all the quests in Highlands). And this is from 80 level starting experience. Right now I lack 4 bars to 84 level and finished full Vashj'ir and Deepholme (and most of Hyjal, but there's one quest bugged which prevents you to continiue the story). I even recall Blizzard saying that you will have to finish every zone to ding 85.</div></div><hr />

I can't say if something is too hard or not on beta, obviously. But I think a lot of people say it is hard too fast because if you started playing in WotLK everything is hard because you got boosted by experienced raiders with at least 1 tier higher gear than you need to do heroic 5 man dungeons.<br />
<br />
And really, how hard can solo questing and 5 man dungeons be? I hope they keep it hard because the 9 - 10 million subscribers who have been playing for at least 2 to 3 years want some challanges also, I guess.</div></div><hr />

I think you didn't really understand what he was trying to explain. I think he means that the difficulty between level 82 and level 84 quests is the same as the difficulty between level 72 and 79 quests. People are not used to that and figure they can easily do level 84 quests and dungeons in level 82 gear. <br />
<br />
The difficulty of the quests and dungeons and the gear ramp up (is that correct english?) twice as fast as in WotLK because there are only 5 levels added to Cataclysm.</div></div><hr />

My only concern atm is server stability when you have everyone cramped into a single zone at a time, like it used to be in TBC. I was very happy when Wotlk had both Howling Fjord and Borean Tundra to choose from, then moving onto Dragonblight and Grizzly Hills, respectively. It wasnt until Storm Peaks and Icecrown that a lot of players found themselves into the same zones. <br />
<br />
Not looking forward to having the whole realm forced into these news zones :(</div></div><hr />

I imagine it will end up nerfed, but not right away, maybe something like this.<br />
<br />
<br />
Heroics and CataTier1 at release<br />
Patch 4.1 comes out with CataTier2 and a minor nerf to dungeons/heroics<br />
Patch 4.2 comes out with CataTier3, and a more significant nerf to heroics and a minor nerf to CataTier1<br />
Patch 4.3 comes out with CataTier4 and a more significant nerf to CataTier1, and a minor nerf to CataTier2<br />
<br />
This would of course, be to promote alt leveling and newer players who are not already in CataTier3 gear come CataTier4.</div></div><hr />

Fine, go play the beta, find some bugs / suggestions, post'em and there you go, blue post ! Because if no one ask anything there wont be any f*cking blue post.<br />
<br />
Until then, quit bitching, it's getting really annoying.<br />
<br />
This. Paladins are basically the only class in Beta that people who have played the class before sit down and say, &quot;Okay... I have all these new abilities. Now what the hell do I do? Do I use this for that, or maybe this for this instead? I should test it.&quot; If other classes had major questions, they'd be answered. But since they don't, there are no questions to be answered. It's simple logic which people on the internet tend to be unable to grasp. Instead they see it as, &quot;Blizzard is neglecting me! WHAAAAAA!&quot; instead of &quot;Blizzard isn't answering my questions, meaning there can't be any major ones. That's good.&quot; And when there are large posts about every class that is not Paladins, they usually complain anyway because what THEY specifically wanted to know wasn't answered or Blizzard decided to answer it in a way THEY specifically didn't like.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying Paladins aren't at fault of doing this too. I'm sure they are. And when they do, I'm sure posts just like this will tell them to shut up too. But until then, UP THE F*** SHUT! Unscramble that, because I'm sure most complaining about &quot;Paladin spam&quot; have a level of intelligence at which that is still challenging enough to keep them busy instead of posting.<br />
<br />
As for my own concerns, can someone give an actual in-game screenshot of the pet so we can see the size in comparison to the player? As Boub said, it's kind of small. I just want to see what the slightly low-res textures actually make it look like.<br />
<br />
I'm also looking forward to challenging dungeons. My guild used to go back with alts and the gear of the time and do Classic and BC dungeons and raids just to see how challenging and fun they were, and I noticed a sharp drop-off between BC and Wrath. Glad to see it's getting restored.</div></div><hr />

All the classes have changed mechanics and TONS of unanswered questions, MAJOR questions mind you.

The physical ability to tank is still there for the Death Knight, but the rune system makes it retarded to use cooldowns compared to any other tank class.<br />
<br />
At present, due to blood runes, i can only cast Heart Strike OR Vampiric Blood, every 10 seconds (ignoring Vampiric Bloods seperate cooldown).<br />
<br />
This would be equal to making Heroic Strike and Last Stand share a 10 second cooldown.<br />
<br />
That was just one example of how the new rune system has broken cooldowns for Death Knight tanking.<br />
<br />
Does this make sense to you yet?</div></div><hr />

In the last raid tier's epics I would expect to be able to stomp through heroics without using CC.<br />

The problem with WotLK dungeons (both Normal and Heroic) is that none of them required CC. Ever.</div></div><hr />

I think a better comparison would be if shield slam and Shield Block shared a cd. As it is on beta dk tanks have to choose to either use a damaging attack for threat and risk dying or using a cd and risk losing aggro. You than cannot use either for 10 seconds unless you just happen to get lucky and proc a blood rune to be refreshed.</div></div><hr />

About CC and facerolling dungeons: some dungeons DO require some CC and other intelligent tactics if you do them in normal mode with a group of &lt; 80's with &lt; 200 iLvl greens and blues. The 3 ICC dungeons are only the most recent and obvious examples, but there are others too. <br />
<br />
The problem was already mentioned above: any ingenious mob mechanic disappears when you have enough gear to simply absorb the damage you are being punished with for not being tactical.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There's loads of threads everywhere about DKs and Rogues with 20+ pages and they're all pretty much ignored. There are loads more being created every day because people hope that if they spam the forum GC will eventually say something. He won't (except maybe to post &quot;this isn't the feedback we want! coolface.jpg&quot;). DKs do get some blue posts sometimes, but they're all &quot;nah we think it's okay you're just bad&quot;. Rogues don't get any. HaT hasn't been working properly since the beta started and no one can figure out if it's a bug or intentional because despite the dozens of threads about it they've all been ignored. Hell, even Mages are getting some neglect, but at least they weren't completely ignored talent tree wise no matter what their issues were (DKs) or get utterly broken thanks to the new trees (Rogues).<br />
<br />
So glad I don't play any of those classes. But then again I don't play a Paladin or Warrior either, so maybe I'm SoL.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wrath of the Lich King was released (if I remember correctly) on November 13th and I got to level 80 with my rerolled main on November 29th. I'm pretty sure I completed all of them on the way to 80 but I know for a fact that there was no CC.

<br />

<br />
HAhahaha... you're serious?<br />
<br />
Heroic Strike and Heart Strike both use the primary resource.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, our Rune Dump ability to generate threat is only viable after a Dodge or a Parry.<br />
<br />
So yes, theoretically, Heart Strike is our version of Heroic Strike in that is is ALWAYS available as long as you have resources for it.<br />
<br />
If you want to compare Rune Strike to Heroic Strike, then i can do nowt but laugh.<br />
<br />
So again, would you consider it to be fair that Heroic Strike share a 10 second cooldown with Last Stand? Or Devestate share a 10 second cooldown with Shield Wall?<br />
<br />
Cooldowns that require Runes:<br />
Rune Tap - Blood Rune (Means we can't use Heart Strike for 10 seconds)<br />
Vampiric Blood - Blood Rune (Means we can't use Heart Strike for 10 seconds)<br />
Bone Shield - Unholy Rune (Means we can't use Plague Strike for 10 seconds)<br />
<br />
For example, say there is an encounter that does an ability at random intervals (still announces it, but cannot be tracked by DBM or whatever). I've just used Plague Strike &amp; Heart Strike, then the boss announces he is about to use omgwtfbbq attack. I cannot pop Vampiric Blood or Bone Shield due to using my only available runes for the attacks 3 seconds before hand.<br />
<br />
All Blizzard need to do is give those three abiltiies a Runic Power cost instead, like Icebound Fortitude, and everything will be sorted.<br />
<br />
Blizzard seem to want to make the DPS/PvP side of DKs insanely OP, whilst making the Tank side insanely gimped (compared to other tank classes).</div></div><hr />

It's a 5-man dungeon for crying out loud. 5-man dungeons need to be just hard enough to give true casual players a challenge, but should ultimately be puggable. These aren't raids...not every trash pack needs CC and not every boss needs 5 separate mechanics to avoid. For a person who is obviously a dedicated 25-man raider, it seems very silly to run through the first version of a 5-man dungeon in a beta and complain about every little thing.<br />
<br />
5-man dungeons aren't created for the hardcore raider, they are simply a means to an end. For everyone else in this game who are casual and might not even raid, ever, there are 5-man dungeons which possibly give a pretty good challenge. Raiders who go into 5-man's and complain about how easy they are is on the same level as a casual who goes into a raid and complains about how hard it is.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Heroic Strike and Heart Strike both use the primary resource.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, our Rune Dump ability to generate threat is only viable after a Dodge or a Parry.<br />
<br />
So yes, theoretically, Heart Strike is our version of Heroic Strike in that is is ALWAYS available as long as you have resources for it.<br />
<br />
If you want to compare Rune Strike to Heroic Strike, then i can do nowt but laugh.<br />
<br />
So again, would you consider it to be fair that Heroic Strike share a 10 second cooldown with Last Stand? Or Devestate share a 10 second cooldown with Shield Wall?<br />
<br />
Cooldowns that require Runes:<br />
Rune Tap - Blood Rune (Means we can't use Heart Strike for 10 seconds)<br />
Vampiric Blood - Blood Rune (Means we can't use Heart Strike for 10 seconds)<br />
Bone Shield - Unholy Rune (Means we can't use Plague Strike for 10 seconds)<br />
<br />
For example, say there is an encounter that does an ability at random intervals (still announces it, but cannot be tracked by DBM or whatever). I've just used Plague Strike &amp; Heart Strike, then the boss announces he is about to use omgwtfbbq attack. I cannot pop Vampiric Blood or Bone Shield due to using my only available runes for the attacks 3 seconds before hand.<br />
<br />
All Blizzard need to do is give those three abiltiies a Runic Power cost instead, like Icebound Fortitude, and everything will be sorted.<br />
<br />
Blizzard seem to want to make the DPS/PvP side of DKs insanely OP, whilst making the Tank side insanely gimped (compared to other tank classes).<br />

It's a 5-man dungeon for crying out loud. 5-man dungeons need to be just hard enough to give true casual players a challenge, but should ultimately be puggable. These aren't raids...not every trash pack needs CC and not every boss needs 5 separate mechanics to avoid.

<br />
5-man dungeons aren't created for the hardcore raider, they are simply a means to an end. For everyone else in this game who are casual and might not even raid, ever, there are 5-man dungeons which possibly give a pretty good challenge. Raiders who go into 5-man's and complain about how easy they are is on the same level as a casual who goes into a raid and complains about how hard it is.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sorry but what has being casual or hardcore have anything to do with how hard 5 man dungeons should be? Casual means you play not that much but it doesn't mean you are an idiot who can't cast polymorph. It also doesn't mean that raids are hard for you, there are also casual raiders you know.<br />
<br />
If I were casual, whatever that means, I would want to have hard 5 man dungeons that I can finish within 30 minutes. It means I have a challange and I won't get bored that fast with doing those dungeons. More entertainment for me since I don't raid or barely raid.<br />
<br />
And 5 man dungeons are made for every player also hardcore players or raiders. They need to do those dungeons to obtain gear to raid.<br />

So I guess you think 5-mans should be boring walkovers that cater to bad players as opposed to interesting, challenging pieces of content that properly prepare you to raid? <br />
<br />
I don't think your philosophy makes any sense. Easy != Casual. A casual player is someone who cannot spend large chunks of regular time in the game, not someone who is bad at the game. It's pretty insulting to the millions of casual players to suggest that the game should be dumbed down to cater to them, since they never asked for that to begin with.<br />
<br />

Ok but in that situation, as a quality tank who KNOWS said random omgwtfbbqpwn ability is coming...would you not then keep one of your runes available to hit your cooldown so you can survive? <br />
<br />
Plus I highly doubt we will see many such abilities, as it seems that they want your healers running out of mana to be what mainly causes a wipe, not the tank getting gibbed in a GCD or two. There will be some, but not to the extent that WotLK raids had them.<br />
<br />
I am sure this is a major issue for you, but the way you are presenting it is &quot;I should be able to maintain optimal threat generation AND optimal survivability without having to manage my resources, even though I play a resource limited class&quot; It just comes off as really whiny.</div></div><hr />

I bolded the two points you seem not to grasp. How am i supposed to plan ahead for an ability that is random and not on a timer?<br />
<br />
And i am not saying i should be able to maintain optimal threat and survivability without managing my resources. What i am saying is that we should have equal ability to maintain optimal threat and survivability as other tanks.<br />
<br />
Druids and Warriors cooldowns are completely FREE (minus Frenzied Regeneration for Druids - but i have never known a Druid to EVER be rage starved [i was Feral before rerolling DK]).<br />
<br />
Paladins use mana for theirs i believe, but for a Paladin Tank... mana is pretty much infinate if he knows how to play.<br />
<br />
Im not even asking for ours to be made free, just given a cost (Runic Power instead of Runes) which is more reliable.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Defining a casual, especially in WoW, as simply someone who doesn't spend as much time playing is a bit shortsighted. Being casual means you aren't min/max'ing your character, like you do. Sure, if you and your fellow raiding guildmates go into a new 5-man, you find it easy because you know exactly what gear and stats you need to get the absolute most dps and heals. A casual who plays to have fun is more likely to equip &quot;wrong&quot; gear for their class, not gem correctly (or at all), etc. Therefore, these 5-mans are going to be a ton harder for them.<br />
<br />
My point is that 5-man dungeons aren't going to be tuned to give a hardcore min/max'ing 25-man end-game raider a challenge. They never will. So you complaining about every single thing is pretty much pointless, because they will ALWAYS be easy to you, no matter what. If a 5-man dungeon was a hard challenge to you, then god help all the casuals out there (that's a round-a-bout compliment, basically).<br />
<br />
Now, if you made the same complaints about a heroic version being extremely easy in tier 10 content, then I'd be perfectly fine with your complaints. If it were a raid, then preach on brother. But it's a regular 5-man dungeon for crying out loud. For hardcore players such as yourself, you're going to find every single one boring. That's just how it will be.</div></div><hr />

I think people are not realizing that this isnt just another 5 levels tacked on in the same style as the last 80. A single level increase for your char, or gear, is going to be more significant than its numerical value would indicate from prior leveling experiences. The difference between level 84 and 85 is a lot more significant than 79 and 80 was, both for chars and gear.<br />

<br />
Ad far at the over-emphasis on pally and war posts and lack thereof other classes, maybe it's just the way it will be prior to the release of cata. My main is a warlock and while I have been perusing around looking for hot lock news I havent really come up on anything special. Yes I am a member of the warlocks den but its always nice to see certain things on the front page, while I agree other classes are getting an overhaul, the lock changes to Soul Shards are crucial and important and they are changing the way the class that I love functions at its most basic level. Time will tell, all I know is that nothing will be perfect when cata comes out and when it does release, warlocks will be the first to be nerfed per usual.</div></div><hr />

So you think they are min/maxing their gear in that video? Where did you get that from? They don't even have gear on the beta. They are in lvl 80 epics.<br />
<br />
Even if they got gear they probably wouldn't enchant or gem it because it is just leveling gear.<br />
<br />
And again you assume casual players don't know what gear they have to wear. Not knowing what to wear is the same as being a bad player and not necessarily a casual player. Do you know what casual means? After 80 levels I hope I can assume people know a thing or two about the game.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh and thanks for the video. I hope more people give good suggestions and feedback on the beta instead of just saying &quot;this is too hard&quot; just because they are too lazy to figure something out and actually try.</div></div><hr />

I class myself as a Casual Player.<br />
<br />
I play, at most, 3 days a week for 3-4 hours at a time... this is only to raid. Back when Ulduar came out, i was part of a guild (and participated in) the Server 3rd kill of Yogg Saron 25man. That was whilst Ensidia were still on our server (Magtheridon-EU) at the time.<br />

That's your definition of 'casual' but it isn't necessarily the correct one. It's definitely the one that people are thinking of when using 'casual' as an insult but if you clear all the content in 1 night and you only play to raid why be 'hardcore'?</div></div><hr />

It's getter more and more difficult to be excited about the proposed warrior nerfs changes because there is so much being gutted from the warrior already.<br />
<br />
Less rage.<br />
No more on swing mechanic (I understand the desire to remove this one, I really do).<br />
WW is being delegated to rare situations. Instead of blizzard taking a quality suggestion (50% damage on all targets + %50% weapon damage split between all targets) Blizzard simply chose to make a 'new' whirlwind called Raging Blow... Except it does less damage, hits one target, and requires an enrage effect.<br />
<br />
How can anyone be excited about a skill that does exactly the same thing as before, but to less targets, does less damage, and requires an additional state to be in?<br />
<br />
Now the one thing that blizzard has dangled in front of warriors for ages, heroic leap, is continuing to be nerfed into the ground before it even goes live!<br />
I understand that we can't be allowed to leap freely, that's fine. But why remove the thunderclap effect? It's once every 2 minutes (1.5 talented) it's not going to break anything.<br />
<br />
Of course, after removing the TC ability of it, you offer a &quot;glyph&quot; that will put it back...<br />
<br />
I just don't see how, at least fury warriors, can be excited about the &quot;changes&quot; to warrior.<br />
<br />
While I'm at it, can you please consider changing tactical mastery from tier 2 arms to tier 1? There is already enough penalty in stance dancing, but forcing people to go deep into the arms tree as their second tree just so they can stance dance is bad. Or perhaps let warriors keep 25 base rage while switching to any stance? This would prevent the massive rage starvation situations for all classes. It's just really frustrating that warriors who want to use other abilities are forced to spend 5 really bad points into the top level of arms just to get into 2 points into tactical mastery. The first level of arms is really bad, the second level of arms is really good... Why not cross them up a bit?</div></div><hr />

It's definitely the one that people are thinking of when using 'casual' as an insult but if you clear all the content in 1 night and you only play to raid why be 'hardcore'?<br />
<br />
<br />
clearly they're talking about when content is first released and so called &quot;hardcore&quot; guilds are raiding 5+ nights, &quot;casual hardcore&quot; guilds, as they like to call themselves(lol), are raiding 3, and the casual guilds are still, and forever, only raiding one. i've raided at every level, and trust me, there's a horrifyingly massive difference.</div></div><hr />

I don't think I'm really getting my point across all that well anyway. But 5-man dungeons are not meant to be insanely difficult by any stretch of the imagination. *Maybe* in vanilla, but not now. That's what heroics and raids are for. If you are expecting a regular 5-man dungeon like VP to give you any kind of a challenge while in level-appropriate gear, I just think you're expecting too much out of it. In this case, with VP, having self-confessed heroic ICC25 gear is most likely level-appropriate, from what I've read in other places.<br />
<br />
I'm just confused as to why hardcore raiders are complaining about normal 5-man dungeons. Nothing is really changing, they are still going to be insanely easy. A little CC here and there and some obviously easy boss mechanics so grandma and your 11 year old niece can beat them, but after a couple of months, even that won't be required anymore.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Calaba</div><div class="date">2010-09-07, 04:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Defining a casual, especially in WoW, as simply someone who doesn't spend as much time playing is a bit shortsighted. Being casual means you aren't min/max'ing your character, like you do. Sure, if you and your fellow raiding guildmates go into a new 5-man, you find it easy because you know exactly what gear and stats you need to get the absolute most dps and heals. A casual who plays to have fun is more likely to equip &quot;wrong&quot; gear for their class, not gem correctly (or at all), etc. Therefore, these 5-mans are going to be a ton harder for them.<br />
<br />
My point is that 5-man dungeons aren't going to be tuned to give a hardcore min/max'ing 25-man end-game raider a challenge. They never will. So you complaining about every single thing is pretty much pointless, because they will ALWAYS be easy to you, no matter what. If a 5-man dungeon was a hard challenge to you, then god help all the casuals out there (that's a round-a-bout compliment, basically).<br />
<br />
Now, if you made the same complaints about a heroic version being extremely easy in tier 10 content, then I'd be perfectly fine with your complaints. If it were a raid, then preach on brother. But it's a regular 5-man dungeon for crying out loud. For hardcore players such as yourself, you're going to find every single one boring. That's just how it will be.<br />
<br />
Did you not listen to his commentary? Their gearscore was so low, the LFG tool wouldn't even let them join! Min/Max-ing their gear they are NOT. The problems were:<br />
1) Too low damage on just about every mob. <br />
2) Not enough abilities / boss damage to make the bosses interesting. Such that every boss is reduced to tank-n-spank, the whirlwind boss being a ton-notch example of &quot;just stand here and nuke for a few minutes&quot;.<br />
<br />
Now, this stuff being in beta, it's all subject to change. But as it looks now, EVERY healer that runs this dungeon is just going to be bored, no matter how casual they are. Every group of trash is an AoE pull for the tank, and AoE-fest for the DPS. Most of the time taken was spent on mana breaks after each pull. The dungeon LOOKS good, but is no more fun than the AoE-fests we have in Wrath already.</div></div><hr />

Instead of giving us the news, and just a basic tour of the instance, as he has done a basic tour of so much more in the game, here he spends nearly all the time whining providing his opinion, which is a far cry from his purely neutral and informative videos in the past. This video is extremely annoying and he has very unrealistic expectations for the difficulty of a NORMAL. 5-MAN. DUNGEON. If he wants complexity he can wait till heroic or raids to complain. CC is being introduced in PvE to a lot of players who came in during wrath, or frankly just forgot about it. Expect it in normal 5-mans to neutralize the threat of a pack and later on to simply reduce the threat. It's called stepping stones, and this guy failed to consider such an elementary design concept for this type of game, and thusly doesn't deserve a front page mention on a site this popular.</div></div><hr />

Not an insanely difficult instance but something to keep you awake beyond &quot;Sheep this, trap that, AoE, next pack...&quot;. Personally I think it's fine to expect that from Normal dungeons.<br />

To be good enough to raid you need to get better. Where from? Heroic dungeons.<br />
To be good enough to do heroics you need to get better. Where from? Normal dungeons.<br />
Every stage of group-based activity in the game needs to challenge the majority of the player base to become better at their character.<br />
If there isn't a challenge for the majority of the player base then they get worse, and you get wipes on terrible bosses.</div></div><hr />

Lol well we know what class you play. Other classes complain because for all the broken mechanics and specs in the game, seeing day after day of blue walls of text answering paladin questions with the occasional footnote about warriors is retarded. The eleven year old blood elves cam wait till live to see what's changed like the rest of us apparently have to. I'd rather not get any updates at all than continue to see what paladins are getting and nothing else.</div></div><hr />

The only thing pallies will be able to do well is dps and MAYBE an EMERGENCY heal/pull. And even though they'll be able to do dps, they still won't be able to compete with the more specialized dps classes. The thing that bothers me is that blizzard obviously sees tanking/healing with a pally to be too easy, so they're going to make it a little more &quot;interesting&quot; (Note that &quot;interesting&quot; is often used as a synonym for &quot;harder.&quot;). I don't have anything against making it &quot;interesting,&quot; but for the love of God, Blizzard, don't get so dang carried away with it.</div></div><hr />

Bullshit.<br />
<br />
Hunters have had a HUGE change and have an entirely broken spec, yet i dont think ive seen a single blue post that wasnt talking about Volley.<br />
<br />
Death Knights have a broken rune system (they say improved) that causes tanks to have to trade between threat generation and survivability... something that Warriors, Druids and Paladins don't need to do.</div></div><hr />

And we know which class you don't play.<br />
<br />
Nothing displays maturity more than sweeping generalizations, unprovoked insults, and lashing out at other people just because one feels they aren't getting enough attention.<br />
<br />
If you want someone to blame, why don't you start with the people who insisted that paladins were OP, too easy to play, and that one only had to roll their face across their keyboard to be successful as one. They're the ones that started this chain of events.<br />
<br />
Hatred of Paladins in this case amounts to nothing more than envy. They're doing nothing different than any other class, the only difference is what they're receiving which they have no real control over.</div></div><hr />
