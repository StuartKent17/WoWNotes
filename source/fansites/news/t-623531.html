You might remember this news (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=25825.0) from a few days ago, most of the members from the top PvE guilds Nihilum and SK-Gaming merged in a single guild temporarily called TwentyFifthNovember (http://www.twentyfifthnovember.com/). <br />
<br />
The question is, how much time will it take to see them getting world first kills on raid bosses ? Easy, about 65 Hours and 30 minutes. Wrath of the Lich King was activated on european servers at 22:00 CEST and TwentyFifthNovember (http://www.twentyfifthnovember.com/) killed Kel'thuzad today at 15:30 CEST, and they also killed Sartharion the Onyx Guardian before that. Only Malygos was left and he just died at 18:45 CEST. <br />
<br />
Yes we're talking about 25 man raid instances, it took them less than 3 days (68 Hours and 30 minutes) to get enough people to build a decent raid and down these bosses, it looks like the competition won't be easy in the future. It also means that they already cleared all the PvE content in Wrath of the Lich King and will have to wait for the next content patch 3.1 to have a chance to explore the Ulduar Raid instance. <br />
<br />
Below is a small statement from their site.<br />
<br />
We are proud to declare that all WOTLK PVE raid content has now been cleared. This is both a moment of triumph and a cause for concern. The question in all our minds right now is if we could do this, how soon until the rest of the top guilds in the world clear all the raid content that WOTLK has to offer? Did Blizzard miscalculated in the tuning of these encounters? Or is this Blizzard folding under the weight of a large casual player base that demands to be on equal footing with end-game raiders?<br />
<br />
Malygos down…<br />

<br />
You can find their loot on http://www.twentyfifthnovember.com/ (http://www.twentyfifthnovember.com/) but it doesn't look like there is anything new since the beta loot table.<br />
<br />
The full beta loot tables for each instance (10/25 Players) can be found in the instance summaries:<br />
Naxxramas Loot Table (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=823)<br />
The Obsidian Sanctum Loot Table (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=813)<br />
The Eye of Eternity Loot Table (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=814)<br />
Tier 7 Armor Sets (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=822)<br />

There's way too much public testing which goes on these days, the only thing preventing people from clearing instances is the leveling, they know the tactics, and this instance must be so much easier than original karazhan.<br />

They need to buff the instance imo, the casuals should get the 10 man and the hardcores should get a real challenge in the form of 25man.</div></div><hr />

As said they get paid to play, but I have a very hard time seeing them as &quot;the best&quot; - they aren't the best only the fastest ATM. We will get a better picture once all other guilds have settled in, but for now they can warm themself with their feat of strength I guess :p</div></div><hr />

No, kinda what happens when blizz decided it was a great idea to make the only extensive raid content in wotlk be a raid instance alot of people have already done and mastered. WotLK launched with less original raid content than vanilla did, and that's a pretty hard record to beat. It's a nice big FU from Blizz to anyone that plays this game to raid.</div></div><hr />

I don't think you got what I meant.. The only _new_ raid content in WotLK is 2 dragons that take less than 30 minutes to kill each. So no matter if you're harcore, or play the game 1 hour/week, if you play the game because you like to raid all you get is 2 dragons to kill. That's the only raid content they managed to design. While they've spent tons of time making new quests, zones etc etc. For raiders, all you get is 2 dragons. Hell, the patch that introduce the emerald dragons had more new raid content than WotLK.</div></div><hr />

Actually I'm all for this method. Keep the drops the way they are, just up the difficulty of the 25 man by like 5000% so these &quot;elite raiders&quot; can have their challenge. Meanwhile I'll be enjoying my normal life and the game that I paid for instead of trying to burn through it as quickly as possible. <br />
<br />
1 more vote for 25 man to become impossible mode. Bosses hitting for 90k per swing should be about right. <br />

Actually I hope they leave it as easy as possible so all of these &quot;hardcore badasses&quot; can gtfo and stop trying to turn my game into a lifestyle.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To hell with Nihilum, SK Gaming, 25th November and you similar players. This is a GAME. Not a full time job, getting from 70 to 80 and downing all raid bosses in less than 70 hours is not Blizzards fault, it's you, who have no lives and just keep on playing without actually enjoying the game. &quot;End game raiders&quot;. Does that word make you feel better at the end of each day before you go to sleep, to justify your doing and not being a loser?<br />
<br />

As WoW gets older, the content has been getting easier. I don't have exact numbers, but i'm sure everyone can agree the more instances that comes out, the easier they are. Then content patches in the future nerf them more. If I had to remotely guess at numbers. I would say .5% of WoW Pop. (11 million accounts) compete for world's 1st - top 10. Then another 1% that tries for server firsts. Maybe 5% of WoW Pop that will have all the content cleared come the next content patch. 5% of 11 million is 550,000 people.<br />
Now you think blizzard is going to flinch if they lose 550,000 out of 11 million people because they cleared quickly and can't wait for new content? Or do you think they will be happy because 15% of the population is now able to raid with more enjoyment. All-in-all, a smart move for blizzard.<br />
<br />
As far as them clearing the content so fast...<br />
Congrats. If they were expecting the content to take them til patch 3.1, then they wouldn't be the best. If any guild thinks Blizzard should cater to them because they are the &quot;best&quot; (&quot;best&quot; subject to speculation), then you are an idiot and don't deserve to be the &quot;best&quot;.<br />
<br />
Personally, I would like to see some time records. World's firsts come and go, I won't be looking at who cleared AQ40 first at lvl 60. But would like to see who could clear it the fastest. Then you open up records to everyone for a long amount of time, as opposed to just a 1 time thing. Time records show: group control, knowing the fights to a key, and ways to improve to be fast. In other words, Perfection. <br />
<br />
Edit to stress the GUESSING on the numbers. Beings it won't be 10 posts before someone says, &quot;where did you get those numbers?&quot;</div></div><hr />

Ur bad. They aren't living in basements, they're sponsored to play wow. This is their job.<br />
<br />
I love all the &quot;no life&quot; comments from people that are probably 76 already, spend all day leveling and reading MMO-Champion, and are just jealous that they suck at a video game.<br />
<br />
Me? I'm 73, but I'm not one of those ones bragging about my &quot;life.&quot;<br />
<br />
You have at least one level 70 wow character, I guarantee you that. That already means you've put hundreds of hours into a single video game. That disqualifies you automatically from the &quot;cool&quot; lifestyle that you claim to have. Stop deluding yourself nerd, everyone else at that party wasn't laughing because they were having fun, they were laughing at you.</div></div><hr />

If ppl liked the old world first raid competion, then there is a simple way of just excluding 25thnovember out of the competion since for some reason they get payed for play, mmh never heard of such a silly thing. <br />
The Title of &quot;World First&quot;, 2nd and so on can now go to a guilds who pay to play WoW,not the other way.<br />
So if you think what this guild just did is dumb or something, then just think that they are not a part of the race for World First, since they get payed to play and other Hardcore guild players dont, if they do then just exclude them aswell.</div></div><hr />

<br />
this has nothing to do with blizzard wrongfully tuning the encounters. it has to do with 2 guilds that broke their projects apart (the only 2 guilds that managed to bring fun into following pve progression) to create a guild full of people that WANT and CAN have the lifestyle to make something as ridiculous as this happen.<br />
<br />
shame cause i did follow nihilum and i did follow curse/sk in regards to pve progression and now there's simply nothing to follow or care about. might as well get 25 monkeys to do amphetamines and parachute them into an instance. we can only take solace on how long 3.1 will take to get release :D</div></div><hr />

Yeah because Karazhan is serious top-end content.<br />

Naxx is Karazhan. Even the 25 man version is intended as an introductory raid, not harder than the ten man version. This was a specific design intent.</div></div><hr />

Or is this Blizzard folding under the weight of a large casual player base that demands to be on equal footing with end-game raiders?<br />
<br />
When Burning Crusade launched, hard core raiders were upset because there gear was replaced two step into Outland. It became a bit of a running joke, but there was still a very large outcry against giving up something they had 'worked so hard for' for a green in the first two quests. I don't think Blizzard folded under the weight of casual demand in this instance, but hardcore demand.<br />
<br />
Fast forward from BC's launch and you have WotLK. I'm absolutely loving the game, but it's an exact opposite from BC in terms of gear replacement. I have a hodgepodge of T5/T6 or equivalent gear, and I am two-shotting mobs and not having to stop to drink. I literally do not stop. All of those who raided have gotten to use that gear in the expansion...for Sunwell gear, the whole expansion.<br />
<br />
Hard core raiders got what was asked for, their crazy final-instance gear is still useful in WotLK. Now they're worried that Blizzard is catering to casual demand because it was too easy to get there and complete it.<br />
<br />
I think there should have still been a large gear-jump in WotLK, to bring everyone on par before entering raid content, and thus allowing for the scaling of content based on what you know players will have entering the raiding scene. But I think this could have been done at level 80, in the dungeons before raids, allowing players to gain the advantage of BC raid gear for the leveling process but not use it to skip the dungeon gearing-up step completely. Perhaps next expansion. :)</div></div><hr />

Nerd rage much ? first of its not 3 people who cares , you showed that by you nerd rage , you actually care.<br />
<br />
second , yes they are hardcore , not only in hours spent , but also in how much better than they are then you in this game!<br />
third the epeen crap , why do you even play this game if you don't care about accomplishments , this is a pretty shallow game if you think questing in this game is good , i would advice you to play something like fable 2 or something , i promise you if you &quot;really&quot; dont care about epeen and such , that is a much better game for you to play.<br />
<br />
and finally stop QQ'ing about how others is actually better than you in something! , and serioussly if you have a mortage or not , 40 kids or whatever who cares , you still sucks , do you actually belive that your the only one with a mortage who plays this game?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
We are proud to declare that all WOTLK PVE raid content has now been cleared. This is both a moment of triumph and a cause for concern. The question in all our minds right now is if we could do this, how soon until the rest of the top guilds in the world clear all the raid content that WOTLK has to offer? Did Blizzard miscalculated in the tuning of these encounters? Or is this Blizzard folding under the weight of a large casual player base that demands to be on equal footing with end-game raiders?<br />
<br />
This is hilarious though: rush as fast as you can through the game then complain when you're at the end, sound like a plan--although they may have a point if raid encounters are easier to figure out than their own self-created problems. These guys need to stop complaining when they shoot themselves in the foot.<br />

Sure, Nihilum can clear it like this, but they have Naxx experience, as well as the Sunwell work.

I think what he means is that they blew through content so fast that it's very unlikely they actually enjoyed their time spent levelling up. DOn't even sit here and tell me it's possible to read the quests, get into the lore, and get to 80 in 2 days.

Actually you are wrong , without the hardcore raiders and theyr achivements , there would be alot less so called semi hardcored and casuals. well i am not going to argue , but if you dont see that what games like wow is all about , well i give up . its about accomplishments , if everyone can achieve something in one day , that means they will stop playing the game after 14 days out of boredom. so to make it short , they have to make the game cater to both the super hardcore and casuals.</div></div><hr />

But they are the most hardcore group of player in the game at the moment so I think they will continue their crusade until Arthas is dead more or less. Talking about how &quot;easy&quot; it is, well we will have to see about that when the other guilds are clearing it. By the by the 25-man Naxxramas ain't suppose to be an upgrade to Sunwell difficulties. It's a fucking entry instance so wth, why is everyone so surprised</div></div><hr />

If you keep making a game where 1-4 guilds on a server of thousands of people are the only ones experiencing the high end stuff then you create a low morale among the larger non elite player base. <br />
<br />
Maybe, maybe if people played this game like it was a game and not a life or a job this would not have happened.<br />
<br />
Maybe if people just had fun instead of going crazy to be &quot;first&quot; this would not happen.<br />
<br />
Maybe if people realized that what you do in game has no bearing on you at all in any way. Being leet in game is not leet in life. About the only example to play the way most do is if you go on the gaming circuit and compete and actually win money/prizes. <br />
<br />
One last Final thought, No matter how good this game is it will not last forever. Eventually they will shut it down and retool the whole thing as maybe World of Warcraft II or maybe since we have gone to other planets Universe of Warcraft, lol. Anyway if you finish something fast then it's your own fault you have nothing to do not blizzards. I wonder if the guilds that plow through things enjoy the little things in the game. Or the big like the Giant freeze machine or the armies frozen in time, or the Giant Elites guarding the wall in the Conflagration. I went exploring and have seen every part of Northrend except 3 areas that can only be gotten too by flight. Did I go crazy trying to get to 77 to buy the flying skill for 1000g? No. I sat and I fished. Then I went back to doing the quests in the Tundra.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Are these kids that stupid.....these &quot;end game instances&quot; were not even the end game instances.<br />
<br />
they pushed off the REAL instance to 3.1 because they did not want to delay the release because of the holiday, downturn in the economy and warhammer.<br />
<br />
they rushed this whole thing...and this is more proof of just that.<br />
<br />
THEY also screwed up the gear difference between sunwell and lvl 80 to teh point that its not even that big of a difference....that you can run into lvl 80 instances and still own with 80% of your gear being SW...<br />
<br />
sigh</div></div><hr />

<br />
Completing the current game in three days is pretty silly really, I guess its blizzards fault - too easy to level, instances too easy, way too much freedom on test realms, too much datamining.<br />
<br />
Theres no mystery, theres nothing new, most of these people did every single thing already so all they had to do was complete it again.<br />
<br />
Still though, what a massive anticlimax, rush to level 80, trash all content, now what? they have to wait for months.</div></div><hr />

25th November got paid to clear istantly the actual endgame content? Well, congrats to them just because they are paid to play an online game.<br />

For the rest of you all complaining about how much easy is now the game I say: that's the game you had chosen to play, no one forces you to play this supereasy-game.<br />

Like every other hobby or game it may become not only a game but more if you do it extensivly. People who have lvl 70 chars and have played the game for months (maybe even years) cant call this &quot;only a game&quot; any more. Theyve invested hundreds of hours into this.

Seriously, the little press release on their site shows how full of themselves they are. So what if it's cleared quickly? Most of the world's playerbase aren't 80 yet, and when they get there they won't clear the instances in two days like these guys did. Blizzard are a business, and they make smart business decisions when they make the raids tuned to a wide range of players. Most players of this game who don't bother coming to sites like these don't even know who Nihilum and SK Gaming are, and they don't care. Blizzard are still getting only $15 a month from these guys like they get $15 a month from &quot;casuals&quot; - there is no reason why the hardcore's $15 is more special or worthy of being catered to.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vilius</div><div class="date">2008-11-15, 09:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually you are wrong , without the hardcore raiders and theyr achivements , there would be alot less so called semi hardcored and casuals. well i am not going to argue , but if you dont see that what games like wow is all about , well i give up . its about accomplishments , if everyone can achieve something in one day , that means they will stop playing the game after 14 days out of boredom. so to make it short , they have to make the game cater to both the super hardcore and casuals.<br />
<br />
<br />
#1. Its an MMO that allows people to choose what the game is about to them. It seems that you have already said what the game is about to you.<br />
<br />
#2. They have an accomplishment. they mastered these fights in the Beta, figured out what they were going to do to down the bosses the fastest, and they did it. If you count the past weeks of preparation for this, then they did not &quot;achieve something in one day&quot;.<br />
<br />
So all of the sudden, after 4 years, Bliz can not cater to both the hardcore and casual? Why would the company that made Sunwell and Naxx for the small percentage of the raid population to down pre-nerf all of the sudden mess with their money making machine now? I trust that they know what they are doing. All I am saying is that some will never be happy.. thats true in all walks of life.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
good fotball players could also quit tomorrow and even theyr lifes would go on , as have been tried to communicate , is that the $15 from casuals would be the same as a hardcore $15 , there is only one problem with this: most casuals actually somehow is interested in how hardcore player is progressing in the game since they cant do that themselves , i am not saying this is the reality for everyone , but for many these guys are like good sports men that people look up to and want to be like when they are growing up in the wow universe.<br />
<br />
so without the hardcore players , there would be less recruits and less general activity in the wow world ,so again to make it short , both casuals and hardcore players are needed for this game to live.</div></div><hr />

While this may be true, there is diminishing returns on the gear so speak. All of the &quot;rating&quot; stats diminish slightly per level from 70 to 80 so they were no where near as strong as they were at 70 versus 80 with that gear.</div></div><hr />

Have you ever heard about e.sports ? Famous Korean players still payed for playing in tournaments while wearing sponsors clothes, caps, pc components? It's like real professional sports but it's a video game.<br />
They receive from 20,000 to 30,000 thousand dollars per year plus the rewards from LAN tournaments (from 5,000 to 100,000 dollars achieved per team in a single tournament).<br />

Did you really just compare WoW raiding to Starcraft or Counterstrike? Players fighting NPCs to players fighting players?<br />
The big raid guilds do have sponsors, but it's for advertising on their websites. No one would know if they were their clothing because they don't go anywhere to battle... NPCs.<br />
<br />
I'm a big fan of WoW's PvE (but not raiding), but to say it's an e-sport is quite far fetched.</div></div><hr />

2. Beta was much easier.<br />
3. They had a chance to try new bosses and know the strategy.<br />
4. Live is harder to practise because mistakes are mostly wipe. Beta werent.<br />
5. Beta was bugged, you could use op classes to down bosses and see phases.<br />
<br />
How long took your guild to clear kara, 1 month?? Should be the same with naxx.<br />
How long took you to kill Grull??(Before nerf) Like 4 weeks of trying? Should take something similar for malygos.<br />
And was it much easier to kill when you cleared at least once?? Well, yeaaa.<br />
<br />
People are worry that it will be way to easy??<br />
Dont get me wrong but we shouldn`t compare ourselves to these professional* players.<br />

No it's a sign that blizz was catering to hardcore raiders cause those fucking whiners bitched and moaned when their t3 got replaced by outland quest shit. They whined and whined and whined about the gear gap from vanilla to bc to the point that blizz said &quot;fuck it fine keep your damn epics you dickwads&quot; and so hardcore guilds now can go immediately into raiding at 80 without having to touch an instance for new gear. They got to try out all the raids in beta so they knew what was coming, and they didn't have to do shit to prepare for them besides grind to 80.<br />
<br />
It's not that impressive, it just shows they had the dedication to get 25 people to stay up for 72 hours straight to grind to 80 and then hit the raids. A full clear of Nax also isn't something normal guilds are going to do in one night either as the place is rather big. People shouldn't take this as a sign of the apocalypse for WoW raiding. TBH just ignore those attention whores and enjoy the game and you'll find that the lvl 80 raids are quite enjoyable and i'm looking forward to them as they were lots of fun in beta.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To be fair, SK-Gaming was consistently stronger than Nihilum at the end of TBC. So the fact that they combined does make them an incredibly strong raiding team. So to say that &quot;there are many guilds on par&quot; isn't necessarily correct. I'm not saying a good guild won't get 2nd kill, I'm just saying that this instance is evidently no where near being a judge of raiding ability or guild strength.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i mean do you that call yourself hardcore honestly believe the game should cater to you and be rediculously hard so you can stroke your 12 inch e-peen while touching your 2 inch real peen? nax is entry level wotlk raiding. get over it!<br />
<br />
less than 10% of wow players experienced sunwell content, the other 90% spent the same 15 per month so you could continuosly touch your epeen while dancing and emoting how badass you are while cybering with the girl who is really the wierd guy from down the steet. <br />
<br />
<br />
Which is why you 90% should GTFO. Blizzard would still have a ton of money with only 10%, and we'd all have a better game and not have to deal with you noobs asking for things to be dumbed down.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i dont really care about nihilum or whatever guild... i do care about the challenge we will face when we get there... Wotlk so far it has been great, and for the first time since vanilla wow im enjoying leveling and the quests and low level instances, but leveling will end... and thats when this problem might come...<br />
<br />
casuals pay the same as a hardcore, but they dont put the same effort into it... Thats what this is all about. We dont want to see more content then the other guy...we want to have challenge's, to have to put some effort to achieve something. <br />
<br />
the content is there.. its available to all... if you dont put enough effort to see it, why should you see it? and the one that wants to put effort, that wants to have challenge? doesnt he deserve it? you know the meaning of reward right? You want to have access to all content with no effort at all? with half hour of game per week? well, in that case i think blizzard should implement some cheats to allow casuals to be at hardcore level... ::)<br />
<br />
Blizzard created 10 man's to casual players.. thats fine.. now they have to draw a very hard line between 10 and 25 man's... or are both going to be casual raids?!<br />
<br />
<br />
about the e-peen... its not the hardcore raiders that normally go to a heroic / non heroic to show off his new epic... ;) and it was not because hardcore raiders that epics are the new blues... in pre-tbc a epic was really... ermm.. epic... now a epic is a normal item...<br />
<br />
<br />
this excuse that we pay the same is the weird excuse ever invented in wow...</div></div><hr />

<br />
second , yes they are hardcore , not only in hours spent , but also in how much better than they are then you in this game!<br />
third the epeen crap , why do you even play this game if you don't care about accomplishments , this is a pretty shallow game if you think questing in this game is good , i would advice you to play something like fable 2 or something , i promise you if you &quot;really&quot; dont care about epeen and such , that is a much better game for you to play.<br />
<br />
and finally stop QQ'ing about how others is actually better than you in something! , and serioussly if you have a mortage or not , 40 kids or whatever who cares , you still sucks , do you actually belive that your the only one with a mortage who plays this game?<br />

P.S.: Any fucking random raid did the same thing in beta. Malygos isn't more than a playtoy training boss for causual gamers starting with raiding. The real raids only come later like Naxxramas at level 60 and sunwell at level 70 did.</div></div><hr />

All these &quot;world first&quot; are just titles and really a mistake on Blizzards behalf I think. Its just promoting unhealthy gameplay.<br />
<br />
I'm still level 71 and enjoying questing. But if Blizzard start making the raids really hard for these type of people I will be annoyed.<br />
<br />
Its bad enough Naxx (Classic) and Sunwell Plateu were only seen by a handful of players.<br />
<br />
For 99.9% of the playerbase, there is a lot of fun to come. So far everyone is enjoying the expansion at a reasonable pace and nobody cares if a few &quot;I'm paid to play&quot; gamers have researched the content before the game was released and now rushed to 80 to finish it before most people hit 74.<br />
<br />

If the encounters were &quot;difficult&quot; for hardcore raid groups like nihilium they would also be &quot;terribly frustrating&quot; and &quot;almost impossible to clear&quot; for every casual player. So why should blizzard make the game frustrating for 99% of their players? Why should they develope content for such a small playerbase only, it doesn´t make any sense.</div></div><hr />

I mean grats to them it takes some organization to do this, but top guild =/= your average wow player.<br />
<br />
I consider myself average ( not casual, not hardcore ), and between working 50 hour work week, family, waiting in Proudmoore queue of 1700 people last night, fooling around with my DK a bunch - my main is still lvl 71. So yeah ANY fkin game in the world will be short if you spend 23 and 1/2 hours a day playing it - it takes an IQ of 10 to realize that.<br />

Anyway grats to them, but how about next time they take breaks like normal people, actually read the quest text and immerse themselves in the story, work on professions and stuff and then complain 3 fkin days later. Gah!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Being the best/first in the world in anything requires sacrifice and prioritizing that cant be considered normal, sane or even healthy. This is true for any activity, mmorpgs, athletics, baseball, eating contests and growing the longest toenails possible. Excelling in anything provides pleasure, self-worth and satisfaction. This is true for anything, even if the community acknowledging your efforts is small. Sure it might be more rewarding to be say, a great actor than an hardcore wow player but humans are competitive in nature and wil always compete in anything they can think of. What i always find amusing is that the wow community is so judgemental of the people who deviate from the casual norm. If you are too casual you are a noob and if you are too HC ppl apparently hate you for being..., well beats me. This I find funny because on a global scale we (the wow community) are all weirdos. The terms we use and the stuff we get excited about are after all ridiculous, and on some level we all know it:) <br />
<br />
Second, i think its to early to say that the raiding state in WotLK is in bad shape. 25 11 is not a normal guild by any means and tbh this was to be expected. Im pretty sure that normal guilds and even the slightly more hc ones that raid 3+ times a week will have challenges for some time. If this isnt the case then Bliz really made a mistake but that remains to be seen.<br />
<br />
Raiding in early tbc was really horrible, prenerf Gruul was way too hard for and entry level 25man and prenerf Maggy was a real challenge for the best guilds. SSC with insane trash respawns wasnt really that great either. Also these instances required attunements and certain tradeskils was almost a must (i didnt stop using spellfire until 4part t6).<br />
<br />
But i still think that blizzard easily could implement more challenges for HC guilds and im not just talking about getting rare mounts. Uber heroic versions of instances would be a nice way of distributing legendaries. This way they would be even more unique than now and they should be rewarded for skill/dedication and not luck.<br />
<br />
Oh yeah and and once more, gz to 25 11 who most probably are sound asleep while you &quot;casuals&quot; keep grinding away.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aukid32</div><div class="date">2008-11-16, 12:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well fan-bloody-tastic, who really cares?<br />
<br />
Everyone knows this is a lot that is beyond hardcore. These are the people who use vacation days from work to play WoW for days on end without sleep for the sake of getting world firsts, and while there's nothing &quot;wrong&quot; with that, using them as a barometer for anything is absolutely moronic.<br />
<br />
Personally, if a the top ten percent of the &quot;average&quot; (average being, let's say, the middle 50% of all raiding guilds) serious raiding guilds manage to tromp through raid content a bit too quickly for their tastes so that the &quot;casual&quot; serious raiding guilds (thise group being, say, the bottom 20% of that middle-fifty) actually manage to see content in a reasonable time frame, then I could give a crap less about the feelings of the people who sacrifice work, personal life, and other hobbies for the sake of WoW.<br />
<br />
I don't see anything wrong with WoW being your primary hobby, but bursting into tears because the game has been tuned to be more accessible to people with more than one hobby and a life outside of online gaming is absolutely inexcusable. There's nothing awful about being a hard-core raiding guild, but if the entirety of the game is tuned to a significant minority of players, something stupid is afoot.</div></div><hr />

The game was rather challenging and on a good level just before TBC got released then it has just gone down hill from there.. from medium -&gt; easy -&gt; very easy.. fun.<br />
<br />
And to those saying whaa whaa, so few ever saw SWP/BT bla bla thats NOT true, if you werent complete shit and/or didnt have the time to go there THAT is the reason you werent able to see it.<br />
Dont blame it on the game because ANYONE with more than 3 hours to spend every other day on the game CAN and WILL see the end content in this game if they want to do it.<br />
<br />
What you shitheads dont realize when you say BUT WE WONT EVER SEE THIS CONTENT ANYWAY is that youre not the only demographic for the game, what are those who want to play this game alot more than you do to do when the content is possible to be steamrolled through?<br />
Its not fun for anyone, its like playing a RTS with infinite resources and invincible units.. boring as fuck after 20 minutes.</div></div><hr />

Its also funny with all these &quot;Its just a game&quot; comments being thrown up and down this thread.

<br />
I guess i shouldnt be to surprised tho, i mean, the ability to put yourself in others shoes and understand other peoples perspective on a matter is hardly the most common of mankinds character traits. <br />
<br />
Im not a &quot;hardcore&quot; gamer. I like to read through mmo-champion to keep myself updated. Heck im not even 71 yet but still i have no problem of understanding the joy of being the first/best (yes they are the best at this) guild at pve raiding in wow. Its like being the worlds greatest chess player, or problem solver for that matter. What, you dont think the worlds greatest engineers work 16h a day? The best chess player in the world doesnt play all the time? Ok so you are telling me its different? Oh i see, its because this is a game for you? <br />

a) beeing good at something digitally automatically means you somehow dont have a &quot;real&quot; life<br />
b) someone being payed to do something clearly is a sad bastard<br />
c) if X does what i want to do but ten times faster, there is clearly something wrong and X and his guild should probably not be allowed to compete for world first and other achievements<br />
<br />
Its also funny with all these &quot;Its just a game&quot; comments being thrown up and down this thread. I wonder what people said about the first professional golfplayers, tennisplayers and athletes. &quot;Outrageous! Tennis is a hobby and a lifestyle and now young men can profit from this by playing all day long doing nothing else? Its absurd! What is the society coming to?&quot;... Interesting isnt it?<br />
<br />
I guess i shouldnt be to surprised tho, i mean, the ability to put yourself in others shoes and understand other peoples perspective on a matter is hardly the most common of mankinds character traits. <br />
<br />
Im not a &quot;hardcore&quot; gamer. I like to read through mmo-champion to keep myself updated. Heck im not even 71 yet but still i have no problem of understanding the joy of being the first/best (yes they are the best at this) guild at pve raiding in wow. Its like being the worlds greatest chess player, or problem solver for that matter. What, you dont think the worlds greatest engineers work 16h a day? The best chess player in the world doesnt play all the time? Ok so you are telling me its different? Oh i see, its because this is a game for you? <br />
<br />
Anyway, this quote took the prize tho. Im sure this guy is just joking but if theres anyone out there reading this and in some way nodding his/her head thinking &quot;yea hah damn that would be something&quot;, i feel obligated to respond.<br />
You have obviously no idea how much time &quot;non-nerds&quot; spend doing what they love and get paid to do in that &quot;real&quot; world of yours. <br />
<br />
Oh well off to bed, school all day long tomorrow (yea on a sunday :-\ ), trying to become that engineer i was talking about earlier ;)<br />
<br />
Enjoy LK everyone, cya<br />

<br />
Chess? Unless &quot;top chess players&quot; always have a &quot;beta match&quot; (and of course, a guide telling them what to do next from a &quot;beta chess match version&quot;) to, then , redo that match for real... Not to mention stuff like &quot;well, let's have this old match from 1998 played again now in 2008 championship&quot; to explain naxxramas lol.<br />
<br />
They knew everything from beta (as a matter of fact, everyone who read mmo-champion and other sites too), if the content is actually ridiculous easy or not, we'll probably only see on the next x-pac content patch (if they let ppl play all of it on beta again...).<br />
<br />
I only hope that they don't complain on their sites that Blizzard is &quot;catering for slower casuals&quot; for not releasing the next content patch in december because &quot;we're alread too long in 3.0 and need more stuff to keep playing&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Congratulations on ruining the game for yourselves!<br />
<br />
I hate elitist gamers. They think they are accomplishing something great when they defeat something on a computer screen. It's not about accomplishments; it's about fun. That's what a game is supposed to be - fun. You don't get paid, you don't win medals, and you surely don't advance in the real world by racing through a video game.<br />
<br />
When you don't sleep, eat, or partake in normal IRL activities out of a video game, you are simply ruining video game experiences for yourself. I hope these guilds disband from the amount of incoming QQ.<br />

<br />
As long as they don't start whining about the lack of content, everything is fine with me. Let them clear everything in a few days for all I care, as long as they leave the normal players alone.</div></div><hr />

If you would consider listening to the 10% than on the 90% you should seriously just unplug your internet, and /wrist.<br />
I say unplug first because wouldnt want morons like you in your basement to start following in your retarded footsteps.<br />
And yes...chances are none of em knows how to plug it back in.<br />

10% want a good, challenging game.<br />
90% want everything handed to them, regardless of how much commitment they put in, which leads to a dumbed down snoozefest.<br />

Let's See how Ulduar, Chamber of the Aspects, Icecrown Glacier, [not yet announced raid-instance] will be.<br />
Of course they'll be harder, it's sad to see that half of you seem to think that WotLK raiding somehow is over, it's like saying that BC ended when Karazhan was beaten.<br />

However, this was fast, but as someone mentioned, they listened to the players and didn't hand out T5-equal gear within the first quests, T6+ lasting to 77-80 is wellknown already.</div></div><hr />

its a tought choice...<br />
but hey why not be optimists...and why not believe the world works as we think it works in our litle bubble of reality....lets make this game good and keep earning those 15mil + the 128 mil of the noobs...with the fear that most non-hardcore players aka &quot;noobs&quot;will leave and loose all that money...OR lets do the 128mil +15 of the uber playrs...cause they are bitching for the past 4years...but are still one the game...(btw the numbers are just for example assuming wow has 11mil active acounts...which istn happening)<br />
<br />
and a request..PLZ all of you that dont like this game...just quit...and PLZ let us play the game that we like...there are countless MMOs oute there...pick the hardest and play it..</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's not like the whole player base is capable to do the same, so who cares if some of the top level guilds clear the content fast? Worse for them, cause they'll have to wait for something new... and they can't pretend Blizzard to suit the game on their needs, since of 11 milion players how many are hard core raiders? 1-2%? I don't know.<br />
<br />
If you ask me, Blizzard simply decided they don't care anymore, it's impossible to build content faster enough to please the real hard core raiders, without making it too damn hard for the average people. And by that I mean that if it's not all like Muru's first version or worse it won't take too long to be cleared by them.<br />
<br />
Honestly I don't mind if someone cleared it all, it's still there for me to enjoy at my own pace, if and when I'll be able too. I pay the game cause I like it, I don't pay to see it all anyway, since I don't even have time to raid a lot anymore.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kawari</div><div class="date">2008-11-16, 03:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think there is a simple (well it takes quite a bit of work) solution for the people that believe the game is too easy. Heroic difficulty in raids as well. Sure it may sound a little over the top but if blizz would do that then it would pretty much tailor to every single type of player that enjoys this game. Of course said group of people would have to do some sort of epic attunement quests to be able to unlock the heroic difficulty but that is the point. Only the people that are truly hardcore would be challenged by it. I believe this way Blizzard would pretty much cover the spectrum. 10 man raids = casuals/people that have a family, full time job, other responsibilities. 25 man raids = not so casual, yet not hardcore/guilds that have gotten organized and have set groups. 25 man Heroic raid = people that can devote 8+ hours a day on the game...for these people the fights have to be reworked a bit, mobs need way higher hit points/armor/resistances, and hardcore attunement. I don't know, just an idea to throw out there...could work imo.<br />
<br />
Edit: Also, heroic raids would not available for play on beta servers...the raiders would have to learn as they go...BWAHAHAHA</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Averice</div><div class="date">2008-11-16, 04:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">lol, you have got to be kidding me with that quote.<br />
<br />
Those players in that guild already did everything in Beta! They downed the bosses in beta, they leveled in beta, they already played the entire expansion in beta. How can they complain that the challenge of raiding is being compromised when it's impossible for it to have been a challenge for them?<br />
<br />
They hit 80 3 days after the game came out. 3 days. If they want a challenge then they shouldn't have done everything ahead of time. Shouldn't have planned out ahead of time. But those raiders obviously didn't want a challenge, they wanted a world first. The point of this game is not world firsts.<br />
<br />
Nothing wrong with being elitist. The problem is when you make retarded statements like the one quoted in this article and you don't look elitist anymore, you look like a scrub who is whining about nothing.<br />
<br />
Edit: There are no games designed for &quot;top raiding guilds&quot;. That would be a game designed for maybe 500 people in total. Good luck finding that.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">slimj091</div><div class="date">2008-11-16, 04:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">IMO THEY can wait for everyone else and whinge all they like they like about having nothing to do, they rushed it, metagamed it, the rest of us should just relax and enjoy the game while they cancel their accounts out of boredom. TBH couldn't care less, most of the rest of us live in the real world.<br />
<br />
<br />
i agree.. they get paid to blow through the content no matter what the difficulty level of said content is so they can give interviews that no one cares about after failed live raids at any blizzard event. <br />
<br />
what a lot of people forget (including our twentyfifthnovember overlords) is that naxx 2.0, Obsidian Sanctum, and eye of eternity were never meant to be the pinacle of raiding difficulty. Blizzard stated many times for months before the 13ths that the first raid dungeons would be no harder than kara is for 70's. and yet people are suprised. i'll tell you that i personally expected one of these collection of losers to clear all three dungeons within days of Wotlk's release for the simple fact that that is what they do. they blow through content and complain that it was too easy afterwards. it's what they get paid to do.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rockape</div><div class="date">2008-11-16, 04:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">First, congratulations. But honestly, this can only be interpreted one way. <br />
<br />
They are being sponsored, so this basically IS their job. Hardly anyone else will have this amount of time to dedicate to the game and blizzard of course knows this. But I imagine that they would be worried about their sponsorship drying up without content and the fact that they just wanted to make waves with this news and be in the public eye.<br />
<br />
They want the casuals pushed back down &quot;in their place&quot; I assume. Afterall, if everyone could complete the end game content, who really cares about you, (TwentyFifthNovember), right? I think they are afraid of losing status and sponsorship, nothing more. Blizzard is not going to cater to you so just stop trying and pick another game.<br />
<br />
To them I say, it's very petty of you to make comments like you have. You know the situation. You know most people will take much longer to complete the content and have a much better time doing it. <br />
<br />
And my suggestion to your sponsors? Save your money. They are a waste of your time and money and in the end will only impact you negatively if you continue to support them.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">octoberfest</div><div class="date">2008-11-16, 04:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">guys this game is meant for pvp...the Only fun in wow is pvp because it is the only challenge....how much fun is it to learn a strat for a raid like kara and then do it everyweek with no change, no increased difficulty, and no challenge...pve is to me for nubs....sure it is fun the first time or two you do a raid because it is something new but it is not dynamic and it does not change once you learn it...pvp changes everytime you encounter somebody because people have different gear, different strategy, and different skill levels...no two encounters are ever the same and that takes true skill to master....<br />
<br />
so i say let these raiders do there content in 3 days and not care because it is the nub dumbed down version of wow and you should stick with real wow: the pvp side</div></div><hr />

<br />
Secondly. This is a sad day for me. I have been playing since the start of the closed beta almost 5 years ago. I have seen the content from head to toe and downed every boss in history before Wrath of the Lich King.<br />
<br />
(I have always been about seeing the content being able to say I have done this, and I have always been happy with this, but in the end seeing content being demolished that quickly is really dissapointing) <br />
<br />
I was looking forward to encountering challenges and achievements for this expansion. But if the challenge of who's going to beat this boss or that encounter first has already been beaten after 53 hours of Wrath of the Lick King. Where is the fun in this?<br />
<br />
It discusses me to see how blizzard has changed this game from what I loved to complete and utter crap because people were loosing interested so they had to make it so easy and so obtainable for everyone.<br />
<br />
And I know I am sort of bashing TwentyFifthNovember but Im not I really am so amazed at effort put into this and getting the world firsts. Also I know TwentyFifthNovember &quot;are&quot; some of the best players and have worked together for ever so I might be over exadurating but I still believe Blizzard has ruined the expansion already by letting content be to easy.<br />
<br />
Anyways sorry for Grammar little irritated currently. Anyways congratulations again TwentyFifthNovember and hope this fast WOK content clearge dosent disrupt anything with your ass pwnage over the years.<br />

They don't fucking care about the lore of the game, their only goal is to beat some stupid records just because they want attention from the news website like mmo-champion to talk about them and how they are great and bla bla...

<br />
Not paid, right!<br />
<br />
Last time I checked, most top ranked guilds don't have any financial incentives. We're #1 Alliance on my server, and everyone throws in $2 for the Vent server every few months. Honestly, paid guilds aren't at the same level of 99% of the population. <br />
<br />
Put it this way, if I had signed a contract with my sponsors to be world firsts, I'd probably be injecting caffeine into my blood to stay awake for 3 days, coerce my friends to farm/play for me while when I pass out. There's *financial incentive* to do this. <br />
<br />
The rest of us? Taking annual leave for a few days to grind to 80 solo, enjoying the content with our guildies and still playing more than we should (with no financial compensation).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Here's a post from a guild member, on the Nihilum website:<br />
<br />
Everybody knew Naxxramas was a walkover, with half the guild knowing all boss strats allready.<br />
<br />
They had the option to pratice on Malygos on the beta, so it was expect to be fast, but tbh was faster than on beta, since the PvP gear on beta didden't allow for a easy kill.<br />
<br />
Just a proof of how powerfull SWP gear is for the initial dungeons/raids.<br />
<br />
Also there's still the option to do Sartharion with 1, 2 and 3 drakes which make the encounter signifigent harder. But I'm sure that's for next week's schedule.<br />
<br />
Malygos &amp; Sartharion clearly have not been mistuned as Maulgar+Gruul &amp; Magtheridon was , so it allow for easy content clear in the &quot;Tier 7&quot; spectrum.<br />
<br />
Hopefully Uldar and Sartharion with 3 drakes will provide a more signifigent challenge. Also because they haven't been able to beta test them , thus nobody know the stategies.<br />
<br />
Guilds who cleared SWP before Patch 3.0 will likely do the same as TwentyFifthNovember when their members reach level 80.<br />
<br />
Guilds who still wiped in Karazhan at level 70 might have alot of trouble :-)<br />
<br />
And those who never been to Naxxramas before might need to learn to dance on Heigan ;-)<br />

You think anyone cares more about your statement that you 'dont know how anyone could care about this, or enjoy playing at such an fast pace'.<br />
<br />
They can have fun. Their fun in no way impacts your fun, or life in any way.<br />
<br />
The SP loot still being good at 80 cant exactly be attributed hard core players QQing. Blizzards solution was to make all content very easy through patching, so everyone has the good loot. I thought that meant everyone would be replacing it soon, but I guess not. I say this because people on Silver Hand, a fairly weak server in terms of PvE progression have successfully PuGed KJ, about a day after WotLK. People on good servers were pugging him long ago. Not exactly a raid that qualifies as 'hard'.<br />
<br />
And progression is getting easier, unless BC raids weren't tested at all on beta, I dont know. It took about 40 days for t4 content to be cleared, 3 for t7, by the same sponsored 'no-lifers.' Slight difference.<br />
<br />
Oh, and why is being sponsored a crime...? People frequently pay for things they like, I think its sort of a norm around these parts.</div></div><hr />

That's so impressive. Blizzard is definitely catering to casuals, no question about it.<br />

And tel lme they are not getting paid after you read it-link is at the site 's initial post...and guys having the best TBC gear makes a huge difference...tanks could get uncrashable in full SWP/BT gear (prior to 3.0) that aimed only on avoidance...they prob only changed a few items that found on the way...<br />
If Bliz did the same with items as did in BC it would take much more time for em cause thier gear would be crap in lvl 78<br />
Tbh i doubt there were only 20 ppl who played those characters-they were probably under the same facility and swapped about-having an addon like xpearl for example you would only press a button and make everything set for the next player UI wise..no downtime no nothing-go sleep for 6 hours while i take a lvl...<br />
Not to mention they even knew how many and where even every critter in those raid instances were...for all we know they may have also practised the same &quot;feat&quot; in Beta in the exact same way</div></div><hr />

So, it's just a matter of waiting on 3.1 for them now. Then clear that in 2 days.<br />
Then 3.2, etc etc.<br />
<br />
This proves the value of farming raid content on beta servers if you're trying to get world firsts i guess.<br />
But still, they'll be bored out of their mind, and start complaining about the lack of content now. Way to go :P</div></div><hr />

WotLK launched with less original raid content than vanilla did, and that's a pretty hard record to beat. It's a nice big FU from Blizz to anyone that plays this game to raid.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sorry, but this is complete balooney.<br />
<br />
The original wow shipped without ANY raid content. Onyxia was implemented shortly after US release, and MC also a month or two into the actual game, but it took at least half a year to a full year before BWL was implemented.<br />
<br />
Of course, you may count out naxxramas, however remember the reason its there is that for most people naxx never got to become a part of the raiding tree.<br />
<br />
Also, when you practise in beta and go with full sunwell gear, what the hell do you expect? this is Tier 7 content, its not tuned for world first guilds. TBC raids took longer because some of them were horribly overtuned (remember the original magtheriddon and gruul?).<br />
<br />
They really need to understand this game isnt for them yet. There are introductory raids, so once again, what the hell did they expect?</div></div><hr />

Don't worry Blizzard is actively driving those players away, so you and your casual moron friends will soon be alone playing WoW. I´m glad I saw this coming and didn't buy the expansion. <br />

They recycled an old instance, turning it into a joke and added 2 new dragons and you are satisfied with this?<br />
After the all the money they get each month this is all they could deliver? And the like of you think this is GOOD?<br />

They don't fucking care about the lore of the game, their only goal is to beat some stupid records just because they want attention from the news website like mmo-champion to talk about them and how they are great and bla bla... IMO Beating the game 3 days after the release dont make them great at all, they are just pathetic. <br />
<br />
<br />
What lore? The lore that Arthas can be killed with 10 man? What should they do, stop in the middle of raid and wait<br />
a bit to enjoy the surroundings. YOu should complain to Blizzard, not to the people who clear the &quot;new&quot; instances in no time. They didn't design it. Ask them, I bet they would have liked it to be more challenging.</div></div><hr />

Why do you think SK Gaming and Nihilum merged? Was it because they could both fight for WoW LK firsts against each other? No. They merged because they needed people to raid.<br />

In other words, both guilds went through beta, and I'm guessing lots of people in those guilds retired because they realized the challenge from the game was gone. So they needed to merge to get enough people to raid.</div></div><hr />

I enjoy the storylines as well as raiding so I haven't rushed the levelling process and don't expect hit 80 for a couple of weeks. Twentyfifth are a race guild, people who see themselves as &quot;pro-gamers&quot; so they will always rush content rather than drink in the fabulous lore that Blizzard puts into WoW. Their loss as far as I'm concerned.<br />
<br />
Even though they beat the content on Beta this still seems way too quick for me. Clearing the T7 content in level 70 gear can't be what Blizzard intended. Shouldn't there be a gear-check boss or something? I just don't get why Blizz didn't tune it so that these bosses are virtually impossible in level 70 gear and certainly Malygos should have been completely impossible. It isn't QQ from Twentyfifth, it's a genuine concern. They have raced the content in 3 days but how long do you think it will take a regular hardcore guild to clear it? Lots of them got &quot;free&quot; Sunwell gear with the 3.0.2 nerf so will be geared to the teeth. If T7 content isn't re-tuned quickly then hardcore guilds will have it cleared in 2 weeks max. &quot;Working as intended&quot;?</div></div><hr />

<br />
What does it feel like to have a bunch of angry nerds mad at you for playing the game the way you want to play it, claim they don't care, but still bother to post trash about it? I don't know, probably just feels like looking at a bunch of crybaby haters. If you don't like what they did, or how they did it, or care about leveling your level 71 through the game while reading every quest, that's great. If they want to speed through raiding, that's great for them. It's the joys of an MMO, you can play it how you want to as long as you're not breaking the rules that you agree to when you make your account.<br />
<br />
I find it insanely funny how people are sitting in front of their computers bashing these guys, talking about their lack of a &quot;life&quot; and how stupid they are, and bragging how they &quot;pay their mortgage&quot; as if it makes you any cooler than anyone else who plays this game. The fact that you think these people are so low but you still feel the need to compare your awesome lives to theirs just proves how sad you are, not them. If your lives were so great you'd be out living them instead of trying to tell people how to play a video game for christ's sake. Get over yourselves.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Itzamna</div><div class="date">2008-11-16, 10:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think there is a simple (well it takes quite a bit of work) solution for the people that believe the game is too easy. Heroic difficulty in raids as well. Sure it may sound a little over the top but if blizz would do that then it would pretty much tailor to every single type of player that enjoys this game. Of course said group of people would have to do some sort of epic attunement quests to be able to unlock the heroic difficulty but that is the point. Only the people that are truly hardcore would be challenged by it. I believe this way Blizzard would pretty much cover the spectrum. 10 man raids = casuals/people that have a family, full time job, other responsibilities. 25 man raids = not so casual, yet not hardcore/guilds that have gotten organized and have set groups. 25 man Heroic raid = people that can devote 8+ hours a day on the game...for these people the fights have to be reworked a bit, mobs need way higher hit points/armor/resistances, and hardcore attunement. I don't know, just an idea to throw out there...could work imo.<br />
<br />
Edit: Also, heroic raids would not available for play on beta servers...the raiders would have to learn as they go...BWAHAHAHA<br />

<br />
The majority of the reaction to this isn't simply because Nihilim and SK &quot;hardcores&quot; obviously value their raid progression in a game than anything else. (Seriously, have you read their websites? On progression fights, you're expected to be available in a literal 12 hour window every day. Is a video game really worth 84 hours a week, and if it is, what's your real priority in life?) <br />
<br />
No, the reactions are mostly aimed at two things. 1) That 25thNov sees fit to bash Blizzard for &quot;falling off the wagon&quot; and making content for &quot;casuals&quot;. While I agree in some ways with the idea that Blizz is making WoW way too easy in Wrath (class over-homogenization, super inflated stats, simplification of mechanics, etc), I don't agree that tuning the game for more casual players is a negative thing. TBC's raids were far more extensively visited by a far greater demographic of guilds than Vanilla's were. TBC was amazingly more accessible and was a rousing success, despite &quot;hardcore&quot; whining that the game was ruined. If they want to be elitist, fine, but they take &quot;hardcore&quot; to a whole new level and now that it's biting them in the ass they have no right to complain.<br />
<br />
2) Their immodest self-congratulation over beating all PvE content 3 days in, as though it was really a challenge for them. Of course it was Nihilim and SK that did it all first. They were given access to the beta and all it's content before anyone else, and when a game developer uses you as a testbed for new content and you learn it to the point of farm status before the game even comes out, you pretty much invalidate any claims of &quot;firsts&quot; or that you're somehow awesome. No, you're practiced, and you had the advantage of learning everything before everyone else. Congrats.<br />
<br />
Simply put, 25thNov are being a bunch of elitist asses. And to anyone who thinks that Blizz is killing themselves and the game by catering to - oh, let's be conservative here - 70% of their player base by making things &quot;casual&quot;, then you have no idea how to run a business.</div></div><hr />

Some people are amazed that they are still wearing their T6/SWP gear. That itemization in TBC was a large difference with pre-TBC then WotLK's with TBC. But SWP was the real end-game, the hardest dungeon. PreTBC C'Thun + Naxx was the hardest raidcontent. People with T3 could clear Karazhan without lvl 70 blues.<br />
I think the difference is that pre-TBC there weren't that many guilds who cleared Naxx, there are more who cleared BT (T6) now.<br />
<br />
And to each his own, if they want to be world first, that can be a nice goal. Pre-TBC I really liked Naxx and the ambiance. So I'm looking forward hanging around in that place again and enduring battle by battle. And if a battle is too hard, I like to hear other guilds' strategies. So I'm glad they cleared it (in beta and now).</div></div><hr />

First they merge, which looks like they are afraid of the competition and losing their $sponsors. A clever set-up here would at least have the illusion of a &quot;show&quot; competition like in wrestling. The old SK vs Nihilum racing was interesting for that reason.<br />
And then secondly, they berate the rest of the player base. Not a great image for the sponsors to sell!<br />
<br />
Has anyone told these people that successful sport is competitive and that a good gladiator will play to the audience ... maybe someone should complain to their sponsor paymasters, because at the moment their desire to hoard titles for $$ looks more like what gold farmers and spammers do.</div></div><hr />

Ow and another thing I forgot to add: OK they cleared the raidcontent, but there is more. They can spend their days achieving the other achievements, that are only reachable at lvl 80.

<br />
Good to see complete hypocrisy, and in one sentence no less.<br />
<br />
The problem most people have with this 'achievement' is that these people seriously think they are the epitome of raiders in this game. The actual fact of the matter is, is that anyone who can give 12hrs a day, 7 days a week to playing a video game is in no way representative of the community as a whole. In fact, I would hasten to add they have problems. Not even a stockbroker/CEO works 7 days a week, 12 hrs at a time. Do you really think Blizzard designers sit there and wait for TwentyFifthNovember to consume content before sweating over more? No. I dare say the developers are all still hungover from the releae party at work. They have no obligation to make any extra content based on complaints from people who should have been practicing some modicum of moderation over their unhealthy playstyle.<br />
<br />
The simple fact of the matter is, this guild has basically accused Blizzard of having the audacity to ruin their gaming experience by letting them get in there and tear the place apart. Well here's a hint; DON'T PLAY THE BETA and DON'T insist on rushing through the game and levelling within a day! If you insist on being unofficial quality control for Blizzard, then don't complain when the game has no appeal for you when it releases. And is it not more than a little convenient that the majority if not ALL of their guild members got Beta invites? I'm in a pretty good guild on my server and I was the only one that was in Beta....and that was just pure luck.<br />
<br />
As someone said on another forum; 'it's like when you eat a cake too fast due to greed and don't enjoy it? They have achieved the online equivalent.'<br />
<br />
I have no sympathy for them. But well done regardless....I applaud their organisation/logistics more than anything.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, of course the &quot;hardcore&quot; players will be out of content and whining that wow is too easy now. 90% of the playerbase doesn't care and Blizzard likes money, they're not worried about the 10% that now has nothing to do.<br />
<br />
But I'm feeling charitable. Lets have a &quot;Professional&quot; mode, aside the normal and heroic modes for instances. In this Pro Mode, encounters keep their stats for 25 man raids, but only ten players are allowed to enter. Every bossmob will Death-Touch 2 members of this tenman raid 3 minutes into the fight. Oh, also movement speed is reduced by 50%.<br />
<br />
The reward for this impossible content? A feat of strength. No upgraded loot or anything, just some random PoS note in your achievements, that doesn't even give you achievement points and that nobody cares about.<br />
<br />
<br />
Everyone is happy! The Pros won't be out of content for weeks and weeks and WEEKS to come, the rest of us casual players can go about our business and not have to worry that they're getting content or rewards, that's out of reach for us just because we have a f-ing job.</div></div><hr />

<br />
before SW was released, Bliz let them tested the raid for about 2 months and ended up with what we all know now.<br />
<br />
As i can say here: tuning game contents by these players caused a total disaster.<br />
<br />
OLdschool Naxx and SW(before 3.0&#65289;are perfect example of designed for the &quot;top 10%&quot; users. <br />
<br />
By my own games exp, the sunwell content (before 3.0 which SK gaming said &quot;well designed&quot;) is full of ridiculars classes requirements , potion stacking and hunderds of wipes. <br />
<br />
I would like to point out 90% of what those Sk-gaming guys said about &quot;game balance, game designe&quot; was just POS. <br />
<br />
to most gamer i wish everyone just sit tight and enjoy your own game. And also , do not let your guid tanks say &quot;do it like what (fill an elite guild name here) did, they complete it within 3 days&quot;</div></div><hr />

Does no one see anything wrong about this? Malygos by lore should be WAY more epic than Arthas is... if you know the lore behind this game enough this should be absolutely retarted on blizzards part for making the coolest dragon imo (aside from Neltharion) so easy... gfg blizz kinda killed their own lore on that one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So they want Blizzard to tune the raids to the right level of the people who rush to 80 and rush through the current end-game dungeons with little to no sleep? 1% of the player base. Here's news for you, most of us play the game for fun, we don't see WoW as a race and most of us don't want to reach end game and wipe many times in the small time that we have raiding. It's your fault the game is over so fast, you play so much that it no longer becomes a challenge for you.</div></div><hr />

guys, the problem here is not if they rushed or not...<br />
<br />
i, and lots of players, dont really care if they didnt sleep at all or didnt pissed or did it in a bootle...<br />
<br />
<br />
The problem here is that we are afraid of the non existance of a challenge. It doesnt have to be a challenge of the level of swp.. but meh... no challenge at all? whats the point to go there then? other then epics?<br />
<br />
Blizzard created 10 mans to causals be able to raid all content. Thats nice and it was well done. But now they seem to nerf 25 man aswell. They should draw a very hard line between the 2. that was the point of creating 10 man versions no?<br />
<br />
Making dungeons this easy will make them boring... i mean, a guild get to 80, picks 20 guys (its not even needed 25) that are undergeared to a level 80 (diminguish stats) and in a couple of tries the instance is on farm.<br />
<br />
There is no learning curve, there is no sense of job done. <br />
<br />
<br />
Thats the problem here. I couldnt care less if they get to 80 in 2 days or not. They did? good for them, im still enjoying my leveling, that is something i didnt enjoyed that much since vanilla wow. But i do care if when we get to 80, instances are piss easy and doable with no effort.<br />
<br />
if you dont put effort in game then you should stick to 10 man versions, simple as that...<br />
<br />
<br />
plus, lore wise, its dumb that one of the aspects is killed that easy... he should be AT LEAST on the same level as arthas...<br />

As for people saying 'they did it in one hit!'....remember their idea of 'one hit' is months of practice on the Beta, pre-WOTLK Naxx experience, a shedload of Sunwell gear and 12 hour raid windows.<br />

The majority of people due to logisitcs alone will spend weeks learning the fights....like these clowns did MONTHS before WOTLK released on Beta.</div></div><hr />

I was actually trying to make them realize my first point, the two contradicting statements in the first sentence was intended ;)<br />
<br />
And for all you people qq'ing, think about it this way. They have &quot;no life&quot; according to you other guys aka &quot;casuals&quot; (not intended towards they guy i just quoted) because they spend way too much time on the game right? Sit in front of their pc's too much. Well, think about it this way, they took 3-4 days of play to finish the current content.<br />
<br />
Now, you will take 1-2 months to finish the same content. playing 3 hours a day for 2 months gives you 180 hours? So who really has no life? The people who clear it withing 80 odd hours or the people who spend 180 hours on the same game? <br />
<br />
THINK ABOUT IT, logically.<br />
<br />
Im not saying anyone here has no life, im saying you cannot assume it just because they are the best at it, you can only KNOW it if you know for a fact they have no job/gf/social life, which you do not know for a fact, you can only assume. <br />

No, it really is not. These people are PAYED to play the game, they are in a SPONSORED guild. If your job asked you to do a special project, where you would have to work most of the day for 3-4 days, would you do it, or quit?<br />
<br />
So many of the responses to this are full of complete ignorance, such as yourself.<br />
<br />
1. &quot;Instances are too easy&quot; - While the current raids are by no means the most difficult of what we will see in WotLK, they are not something you just walk through. Several of you have asked &quot;if they did this undergeared, it must be crazy easy&quot; First off, these guys have full sunwell gear, 4-piece t6 bonuses and whatever odds and ends they picked up leveling. More importantly, they are Pros. All of them have been raiding elites since vanilla wow. Team work and skill &gt; gear.<br />
<br />
2. &quot;Months of practice in beta&quot; - You would have to be an IDIOT to make the statement that the guild as a whole practiced in the beta.....the beta whos testers where selected at RANDOM. While several of their members may have made it into the beta, the enitre guild did not. They knew the bosses because most of their players cleared Naxx at level 60, when it was INSANELY difficult. They are good at raiding. The fights did not change much.<br />
<br />
3. &quot;kids who live in expensive basements and have no lifes&quot; - I bet most of the members of this guild spend less hours working then most of us, and get payed the same if not more to do it. And &quot;awkward silence when someone asks what you do&quot; ??? Hell no, I bet they say with pride that they PLAY A GAME FOR A LIVING. Most of you have anally boring jobs, and only wish you could play a game you already commit THOUSANDS of hours to.<br />
<br />
<br />
It is an accomplishment, for they did something that the majority of people who TRY to do will fail. Even the raid guilds that start doing these fights in the next few weeks will wipe a dozen time before clearing every boss in 25-man naxx, and spend hours on the new dragon bosses. Nihilum/SKgaming players are far better at this game and raiding then 99% of you will ever be.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As a casual myself who puts less amount of time in game, I want the game to be challenging and enjoy that little amount of time I put in raiding and yeah I don't like any other aspect of this game or im not just interested in pvp and etc. Doesn't matter if it takes my casual guild to clear stuff in 1 year but I want to enjoy downing even 2 or 3 bosses.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is their RL job... They get paid to play a game...<br />
<br />
From my point of view: I live in an ex-communist pos country, studying my ass off so I could one day get the f*** out of here, and in my spare time (which is rather nonexistent), I used to play some WoW (didn't even buy WoTLK tbh), now I play some battlenet, spend some time with my girlfriend (no, this isn't bragging) or just play some guitar / read a book.<br />
<br />
What do I earn a month? 0. Nothing. But in a few years (3, to be exact, I'm a poor medical student), I'll be somewhere else... Hopefully. Not the top of the heap, but I bet it'll be better than these guys' current RL/ingame statuses.<br />
<br />
This is just a personal opinion. Sure, I would have loved to live their life, like 5 years ago when I was still a kid with no real concerns. But now, life's tough, a video game won't bring food on the table, nor will it support marriage or any kind of relationship whatsoever. <br />
<br />
Why debate so much... ? Let them be. Play the game the way you like it, not the way THEY like it.<br />

I'd like to clear up a few misconceptions. For someone who berates people for being ignorant, you really don't know much, do you?<br />

- They are not, I repeat NOT paid to play. Some of the older members might get a keyboard or a mouse mat from the sponsors. And the guild masters get to travel to conventions. I never got any stuff from anyone for killing KJ word first. It's a hobby. Get over it. Although I'm pretty sure Mek, Mackzter and Kungen would like to get paid, but there's not money in WoW PVE (yet).<br />

1. Although I also believe teamwork &gt; gear, Blizzard has a long tradition of &quot;gear checks&quot;, where you have to get some gear for it to be physically possible to progress, like resist gear for Ragnaros, Vael, Huhuran, Mother Shahraz, dps gear for Patchwerk, Brutallus etc. I think it's a huge miscalculation from Blizz to have skipped this.<br />
<br />
2. All SK members got beta keys from Blizzard. That said, there was no raiding in Beta. Most people didn't even get to 80.<br />
<br />
3. Here you are correct. SK raided 1 1/2 night a week after the first race to kill bosses, hence the total sum of raiding was much less than those who raid 3-5 nights a week for months.<br />
<br />
- Also you are correct in that most Nihilum/SK players are more skilled than others. Or rather, the players don't screw up, ever. Repeat a mistake in SK and you get kicked, or at least benched. (usually kicked). :)</div></div><hr />

I worry for them though, venturing out into the real world because the streets are a dangerous place for a lvl80 WoW player.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is no challenge if a guild can complete all the raiding WOTLK has to offer in under 3 days.<br />
<br />
Not only is it upsetting because raiding used to be hard, its also annoying be i want a challenge, not bottle fed..</div></div><hr />
