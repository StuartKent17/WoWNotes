nathanos is a trash fucking filler character that needs to be removed, I would take 6 years of thrall over that stupid fucking garbage pile any day. <br />

Giant hole opened up in the ocean defying physics? Sounds plausible. Men and creatures flinging magic from their hands - no worries. Flying air ships in a time of rudimentary technology - all gravy baby. Druid's shape-shifting into multiple creatures in mere seconds. Sounds about right.<br />

<br />
Since when has WoW had 'internal logic'. For that matter, what do you even mean by that? Characters in the story are constantly doing things we've never seen before and you just accept it (see: the tidestone making a giant hole in the ocean), yet you can't fathom a single way that magic or ingenuity could have helped them survive a simple fall? <br />
<br />
Or another way to look at it - many character classes can avoid death in a fall. Slow fall, levitate, shadow step, heroic leap, paladin bubble, druid flappy thing, hunter disengage.</div></div><hr />

Maybe the tidestone is just keeping it held up. Not sure any of the mages in game can just do that and keep it going without concentrating/casting on it.</div></div><hr />

A fair point. Spells require focus. Still. If she did it on her own it wouldn't have raised the question of how a bunch of naga waltzed into the Tomb and snatched a super important relic with nobody the wiser.<br />
<br />
She should have used the Pearl of Pandaria. That is not guarded, was sought after by naga in the comic, and has no use now. Oh well.</div></div><hr />

*Sylvanas' redemption story-arc incoming*<br />
<br />
But seriously, Sylvanas and Nathanos are a Mary Sue couple at this point, and the Alliance is apparently a bunch of idiots.<br />
Saddened to see Aszhara and Naz'jatar being used in this expansion. But I hope with every nerd fiber that it is awesome and that it makes WoW a better game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It does, Nathanos is Sylvanas' right hand he goes where she needs him to, Tyrande most likely won't bother to chase him unless he's leading the Forsaken against her, or just happens to be in Darkshore or Ashenvale, she isn't concerned with what everyone else is doing just what's happening in darkshore, it's doubtful she's keeping in contact beyond receiving resources</div></div><hr />

Yo, Tyrande. It's your BFF Gen. You know the guys who helped you when Anduin didn't want to.<br />

Yo Gen. How's it going? I'm stuck in a time loop called Warfront.<br />

That sucks. Hey, we are fighting a witch called Azshara here. Does the name ring any bell?<br />

Azshara? The Azshara?<br />

Yep. In the flesh. You want in? You can bring your boyfriend as well. Maybe the Shadowsongs.<br />

I would love to, but I don't know how to get there.<br />

It's not the pronoun I have a problem with, it's the fact they're acting like it's an plane or something they're riding in. Plus they were literally sailing straight in pursuit when the sea just opened up in front of them so it's extra dumb to act like a ship not making a sudden stop or turn is something shocking if they're sailors.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because these are apparently the best they still have of their navy and it somewhat makes what is meant to be a dramatic moment a bit stupider if their sailors don't understand how a ship functions. I mean unless their intent (writers) is just to showcase how inept everyone is this expansion. To be frank I would prefer if he did just scream that or by the light or literally anything else that keeps their story somewhat consistent.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It’s quite easy to realise the entire event is sped up a little. They’re not going to waste a cinematic showing the boats trying to stop or turn in “real time”. The sea goes from fine to being massive open in the space of 6-7 seconds in that cinematic, when you see that it’s not even moving *that* fast (just as the Alliance ships tip over the edge). Then again, this is a fantasy game we’re taking about where trying to apply real life logic and physics is nothing more than trying to have a mental pissing game about stuff that doesn’t really matter.</div></div><hr />
