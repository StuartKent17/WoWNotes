Wondering if they actually did this to help leveling or if they didn't change much of anything except a few tweaks here and there and then a few mobs got the 24% nerf...</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Maarius</div><div class="date">2018-07-28, 09:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">interesting, in an interview just a few days ago they said they were fine with the combat tuning since 7.3.5, if more than a few mobs got their health reduced by 24%, this would mean they weren't. <br />
<br />
What I get from forum posts is that people like the time it takes for combat BUT they don't like the XP they get out of quests and mobs. People want more challenging battles but they want to be rewarded for those accordingly.<br />
<br />
Giving more XP to quests would mean that you can still finish zones stories (because of scaling) but you could skip some of them on your way to max. level instead of having to go through a lot more of the zones.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What I'd love to do is just level in whatever zone I want. I really don't want to be forced into Outland &amp; Northrend, or Pandaria &amp; Cataclysm, or even Draenor. I've leveled through it all for years on end, just let me lever wherever I want until the most recent expansion.<br />
<br />
It's all entirely irrelevant story-wise anyway. Nothing makes sense, there's no coherence in timeline. Just let me choose where to grind levels. I don't even care if it takes a bit longer personally, I just want that freedom of choice. I can't even get through 3 or 4 zones in the 1-60 &quot;experience&quot; now, I'm shooed off to old and antiquated mechanic-land, AKA BC &amp; WLK.</div></div><hr />

Classic will be waiting for you. We do not want classic in retail. Also educate yourself, mobs pre 100 had MORE health than mobs after 100 for example.<br />
<br />
Still waiting for XP curve nerf, 60-80 I am talking about you. Also I really hope they will include at least Cata/MoP from 60 tho I would love to see all expansions but current from 60. Until major changes I just stop my allied races at 60.</div></div><hr />

What a goddamn joke.<br />
<br />
Can't fix leveling, can't fix the near-complete lack of customization or anything resembling a balanced experience, so just keep it as easy and fast as possible so everyone can just get it over with as soon as possible, regardless whether or not they enjoy leveling or not. Or else people notice that they can go for dozens of levels without any changes to gameplay or new abilities. Good f'ing riddance.</div></div><hr />

Just because Blizzard has allowed leveling to be completely braindead for so long people are used to it doesn't mean it should remain that way.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Now you're getting it.<br />
Yep I get it, people rather wish for +50% exp gained and mobs health/damage to be reduced by 80%, than to make the whole experience balanced (and thus have potential to be fun along the way)<br />

<br />
But it was that way even with the 7.3.5 changes.<br />
<br />
All they did for the most part with 7.3.5 was buff mob hp. There was no threat to them. Dungeons were still aoefests but just took longer.<br />
<br />
A longer experience is not a more fun one imo. A harder one is.<br />
<br />
The current experience focuses more on time than difficulty. Which was stupid. If they make the experience actually harder then naturally it would take more time but it would be a meaningful experience.<br />
<br />
The world scaling is brilliant. Being able to level in Cata at 85 or go back to Hillsbrad at 40 is awesome. The mob changes were just awful though. They made nothing harder. Just longer.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That is exactly what I've been saying, that the 7.3.5 changes didn't go all the way necessary. The health buff *did* fix the fact that casters barely got two spells off in a trash pack before the melee obliterated everything. The health buff *was* necessary, but so would a proper damage buff as well, and Blizzard failed there.<br />
<br />
<br />
A longer experience is not a more fun one imo. A harder one is.<br />
In a perfect world Blizzard can keep leveling time unchanged while making it resemble a properly balanced RPG again, but I'd have zero issues with 10-20% slower leveling overall if I actually had fun doing it. And part of what's necessary then is to make mobs actually hurt a bit, instead Blizzard has now reduced some damage from these mobs that already barely hurt even without heirlooms?<br />
<br />
<br />
The current experience focuses more on time than difficulty. Which was stupid. If they make the experience actually harder then naturally it would take more time but it would be a meaningful experience.<br />
Yes, that is correct<br />
One thing that can be pointed out however is that mobs do need more health partially for the difficulty, you can't take damage if the mob doesn't have time to reach you, but as said, they didn't buff damage nearly enough to hit the levels necessary (ie, health becomes a resource, you want to use stuns etc to minimize damage taken, that is not the case even after the 7.3.5 changes)<br />
<br />
<br />
The world scaling is brilliant. Being able to level in Cata at 85 or go back to Hillsbrad at 40 is awesome. The mob changes were just awful though. They made nothing harder. Just longer. <br />
<br />
Yep, no doubt<br />
I actually leveled in Loch Modan, for a meaningful amount of time and saw quests I've pretty much never touched past a certain point, because things didn't turn grey in 30 minutes.<br />
<br />
I keep pointing out that mobs do need to be harder, but evidently very few are able to tell how that can be part of a more enjoyable experience, how mobs that actually hurt you makes your spellbook relevant, actually might put you in situations where you have to focus to survive etc. I can almost argue that mob damage needs to be doubled at this point. But with Blizzard actually reducing their damage now, from mobs that are already nothing but damage sponges, tells me there's no hope for leveling. It will remain a godmode ARPG hurdle to max level and nothing else, where you can randomly mash buttons and still end combat at 95% health. <br />
<br />
No matter how much more focus there is on max-level content, making leveling into what it is now is a gigantic waste, and people hate it no matter how quickly you level because you barely even get to upgrade your gear... in a freaking MMORPG.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A damage buff would just revert the health buff, makes no sense. Just give more XP per mob and quest so that you don't have to kill that many enemies in order to level up.</div></div><hr />

ICC isn't that bad tbh.<br />

Just takes a few more hits for each boss. They still barely hit you for anything though. Lich King doesn't get any of the annoying mechanics off still either like Shadow Traps or orbs.<br />

In legion yeah, but in draenor its different. I leveled there last night just before the hoxfix and even tanking 2 mobs required me to heal myself unless I got some procs lol. I could &quot;tank&quot; multiple mobs with my earth elemental just fine though, but the elites literally required BL and all cds to get down. Even this morning after the so called nerf, the mobs still hit way harder AND have more HP than legion, its dumb tbh.</div></div><hr />

I experienced exactly this last week, hp in draenor war partially doubled compared to legion. That does make NO sense.<br />
<br />
Draenor was already overtuned prior to 8.0. I'm not sure the relative hps but i'm fairly sure that because they put in ilvl scaling for Legion, the mobs in legion were easier to kill in shit gear than doing the same in prior expacs would have been.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately for us, they have decided that everyone at any given level needs to have the exact same ilvl so they can tune how much our time they can get away with burning at lower levels with the touch of a dial.<br />
<br />
I really don't think destroying power progression and forcing people into 110 levels of world trash taking X seconds to kill no matter what is a good idea and the only hope they have of this shit blowing over is if the release of the expac distracts people from the leveling again.<br />
<br />
If they hadn't put this shit live for a month with jack shit to do, they may have gotten away with it but now that people are aware and hopefully they will end up having to back off this ridiculous notion that to get to 10 levels below max you need to put in a good work week or two.</div></div><hr />

now its time to force them into doubling or tripping xp bonus from heirlooms <br />

For me, I would say 15-20 zones worth of content feels like an appropriate amount to aim for. With 110 levels to grind through, that represents 5-7 levels per zone. So here's my opinion: make each continent a 20-100 continent, and make the completion of a single zone worth about 6 levels. Then moderate completion of each continent would be worth about 40 levels, and it would take about two continents worth of content, plus Legion, to get to max, from 20. This way, you can get to 20, and then level a character all the way to 100 by doing WoD and MoP, for example.<br />
<br />
This would do so much to liven up the experience. You could level three different alts and do almost none of the same content between them.<br />

It's such a shame that they have so much content in the game, and their idea of exposing people to it is to make them scratch the surface of every xpac, the same way with every character.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah I agree with this. If you're going to do scaling, just scale it to max. If people want to keep questing in Eastern Plaguelands when they hit 60, just let them.<br />
<br />
Of course, since they've demonstrated that they can do it all very wrong very fast and very easily, I dunno.<br />
<br />
I don't have a problem with the dungeons/mobs taking more time to complete/kill. Just make the exp worth it. I had a warrior at 56 and I gave up yesterday and just used my 110 boost on him. Anybody who thinks these changes werent done partially to increase boost sales is just naive, sorry. <br />
<br />
And FFS buff the crap out of heirlooms already. That's. What. They're. For. If one person wants a slow, laborious, &quot;enriching&quot; (grindy) experience that they've done 20 times before, great. I think they should be able to do that, and they can, by not equipping any heirlooms. If a second person wants a faster, swifter experience to skip the same crap ad nauseum, great. <br />
<br />
Everybody can have what they want - it is actually possible. There is no need to drag everyone down to the same tedious level.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Gaining more experience from a kill doesn't make you kill stuff faster. So exp boost itself is not the issue, but how they nerfed the stats on them. Now a rare item of the same level is more powerful than the heirloom.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rustov</div><div class="date">2018-07-28, 10:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, scaling all zones 20-110 would be fine (Legion is over, let's not leave Broken Isles as its own mandatory leveling experience).<br />
<br />
I would like if they took a closer look at the scaling system itself. There are definite pros and cons to it, but Blizz has opted for an all-in implementation that really diminishes the RPG power fantasy. Take a look at what they did in Destiny for a more nuanced approach.<br />
Every mob has a single level, that doesn't change. What scales is your power relative to that mob's level. Mobs above you have a scaled power factor against you, that diminishes as you approach their level. As you outlevel them, you gain a power factor over them, but the factor diminishes exponentially as your level grows, eventually flatlining. You only ever grow so strong.<br />
<br />
In WoW it might look like this: Stitches is a level 30 Elite. You're level 20, you're hopelessly outmatched. At 25, you might start to think about getting a group together, and around 28-30, class depending, you're ready to take on Stitches solo. As you level further, Stitches gets easier and easier, until at level 40 you could breeze through his hp with half a rotation- 3-4 globals. However, it's the same at 50, and 60, and even 110: he's still a breeze, but not a one shot. A huge pack of Stitches might conceivably ruin your day.<br />
<br />
I think it really begets the question, then, what is Blizz's philosophy about outleveled content? Do they want to keep it relevant, as an additional legitimate activity you would dabble for whatever purpose, easy but not trivial? Or should everything be left behind, grey and globaled? For me, Destiny 1 went with the former solution and I thought it worked quite well.</div></div><hr />

It doesn't matter if a rare item more powerful than their heirloom because the heirloom outscales it in 2-3 levels. Levelling content used to be a pushover in non heirloom gear, WITH heirloom gear it was just plain retarded and one button one shot galore. Blizzard learned that having heirloom gear be the &quot;Ultimate gear piece&quot; was meddling with everything, say for instance in BG's where if you didn't have heirlooms you were just cannonfodder and graveyard bait. <br />
<br />
The fact that you get xp bonus from it AND it scales with your levels should be a huge bonus in itself, why should it overshine every single piece of gear in the game?</div></div><hr />

<br />
The main issue for me about trying to keep leveling relevant is that the story is not cohesive anymore. So many things have changed over the 14 years WoW has existed in terms of lore. The Cataclysm changes have made the story disjointed and kind of hard to follow. I can't imagine how confusing it must be for someone who has never played the game before to level a character from scratch.<br />
<br />
The Horde has gone through 4 Warchiefs. You start out with Sylvanas, then you do some zones and Garrosh is the warchief, go to Outland and Garrosh is just an angsty teenager, then you go to Northrend and Thrall is in power, back to Garrosh when you do Cataclysm and Pandaria then you hit Warlords and it's Vol'jin, back to Sylvanas for Legion. They don't really explain the changes during questing either. Thrall named Garrosh the Warchief in a book, Vol'jin was given the role in a raid cutscene that people won't see while leveling. I think Sylvanas might be the only one you see while leveling because I don't think you can skip the Broken Shore scenario if you've never done it before.<br />
<br />
Same thing with just the story in general. If you level up a Monk, you're sent to Pandaria early on, then once you hit level 80 you can go to this &quot;unknown&quot; world and meet these &quot;strangers&quot; that you've been hitting up every day for a rested XP bonus...<br />
<br />
If they want to keep leveling content relevant, they really need to overhaul the story again and establish a better timeline for everything that happens. It's hard to be really interested in what's going on if it makes no sense.</div></div><hr />

You people realize that draenor mobs have almost twice as much health as legion, right? Just another weird &quot;hotfix&quot; with little thought behind. It's a step in the right direction that's for sure but still more work has to be done. Some of you people talk about 1-100 leveling like you've actually done it. But I'm guessing you really haven't. If you had you'd know how bad it is. There is literally no sense of progression at all. The leveling dungeons are on par with mythic difficulty, not even joking. Go ahead, queue up for a CATA leveling dungeon and have some fun. The mob scaling is *fine* even tho I don't like it, what I dislike is the mob health change(that they tripled in 7.3.5 but now lowered).<br />
<br />
60-80 level range is abysmal. We're talking some really ancient expansions here and it shows plays it like it. The health increase on mobs turned them into a complete tedious chore. 80-90 is probably the best level range in the game, beside 100-110. 90-100 is bad because the scaling is just piss poor and damage done by players is just too low. Try a leveling dungeon in draenor then do one in legion. It's a night and day difference. The legion dungeons are complete faceroll currently. Let's just be real if they took the scaling in 15-100 dungeons and used that as a measurement for 110 end-game dungeons, ie heroic or mythic and mythic+. You'd probably be one shot by the first mob in mythic+. How exactly is that properly balanced? It's not. Blizzard didn't test this themselves and it shows. Countless of threads over the months about the issues have been posted on the forum and ignored by blizzard. <br />

I've leveled well over 50 characters to 110 in Legion. I've leveled a lot of characters from 1-110 Legion. Before and after 7.3.5. I know what I'm talking about.

Not sure if it helps, but they did announce that while they looked for the root cause, they would apply a blanket health reduction to at least ease the problem for now. Yes, they done fucked up good, but at least they're reasonably upfront about this particular issue.</div></div><hr />

It's MMORPG, so no, there's no choice. You want to go slow, but then tank in heirlooms casually walks through 5 packs of mobs, kills them in few globals and then calls the rest of the party baddies for not keeping up. Overpowered heirlooms should never return.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anyone else curious how does this work? What we see and what the actual values are not the same? Enemy has 100 hp, we deal 80 damage, enemy dies because enemy actually only has 76 hp. Shouldn't a client software has a function to be suspicious of such thing?<br />

Because that is an heirloom piece of gears purpose. It’s meant to replace and outshine all pieces of equipment in that accessible slot to speed up leveling and make killing things a breeze. Heirlooms original purpose was for players who have leveled alts and don’t want to spend needless hours grinding out something they’ve done multiple times.<br />
Now, the purpose of heirloom is what? A bonus to XP that barely makes a dent. I might save 10-20 minutes a zone now, which is barely perceivable when I spend hours there.</div></div><hr />

No, it's meant to be able to scale with your level and provide a faster way of levelling. You gotta stop thinking that it needs to outshine every single piece of gear by a huge margin available for that slot.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eapoe</div><div class="date">2018-07-30, 01:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No, it's meant to be able to scale with your level and provide a faster way of levelling.

<br />
You forgot where it’s also meant to provide a substantial XP boost while outshining every piece of gear for that slot.<br />
As stated before: the original purpose of heirloom gear was to outshine every piece for that slot, thru the xp gain as well as the power boost it provided.<br />
Now, the original purpose is gone and Blizzard has changed that. In my opinion, as well as many others, it is a bad change. Many people agree that some of the changes Blizzard made can be good, but they should have left heirlooms alone as they were created to incredibly speed up leveling. If people don’t want to use them to have a slower leveling experience, that’s fine; but, it should be a choice between the 2. <br />
As far as PvP, blizzard can obviously just modify gear scaling tech to include heirlooms to not be overpowered in PvP.</div></div><hr />
