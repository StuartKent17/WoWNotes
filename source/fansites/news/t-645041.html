<br />
Recent In Game Fixes - 04/21<br />
Keep in mind that some of these changes may not be active until after the server has been restarted. <br />
The Saronite Animus in the heroic General Vezax encounter has had its health increased.<br />
The Mimiron hard mode has received the following changes: increased damage from Flames, increased damage from Frost Bomb (in heroic), increased damage from Water Spray, and increased the health bonus he receives from Emergency Mode.<br />
The damage bonus of the Frozen Power talent should no longer affect boss creatures.<br />
The buff players receive from Tenacity in Wintergrasp is now stronger.<br />
Stoneclaw Totem should no longer put a shield on hostile targets.<br />
The damage from a Clockwork Sapper’s Energy Sap ability has been decreased.<br />
General Vezax’s abilities, Mark of the Faceless and Shadow Crash, may hit players in melee range depending on the situation and player setup.<br />
Players should no longer be able to quench the Unquenchable Flames debuff from a Molten Colossus by using spells like Cloak of Shadows or Divine Protection. The Molten damage from when Iron Constructs turn molten has been reduced, the ground damage from Scorch has been reduced, and the total health of Ignis himself has been reduced.<br />
For Ignis the Furnace master, Strength of the Creator will now only affect physical damage and he will have to wait for a short time to charge after casting Flame Jets.<br />
Katherine Lee should no longer be attackable in Dalaran, meanies.<br />
Shattering Throw will no longer consume an extra 25 rage.<br />
The heirloom item, Discerning Eye of the Beast, will now return mana at any level.<br />
The item Gauntlets of the Wretched can now be sold or disenchanted.<br />
All of the additional creatures spawned during the XT-002 Deconstructor encounter can now be snared in either difficulty.<br />
It will be slightly more difficult to skip Tympanic Tantrum on XT-002 Deconstructor.<br />
For the Hodir encounter, the damage from Champion of Hodir’s Freezing Breath has been reduced, the haste effect from Starlight has been decreased, and the timer for the hard mode has been decreased.<br />
For the Thorim encounter, the Runic Colossus should stop channeling Runic Smash once engaged in combat, the Dark Rune Champion should no longer whirlwind after being disarmed, and the Runic Colossus should no longer melee when it charges.<br />
Glyph of Polymorph will no longer limit the number of recipes learned through Northrend Inscription Research.<br />
The Iron Council encounter has received the following changes: the amount healed through Electric Charge has been increased, the timer to Berserk has been increased, the range of Overload has been decreased, the Lightning Elementals are no longer immune to nature damage, Stormcaller Brundir's melee damage has been decreased (in normal mode), and increased Runemaster Molgeim's damage.<br />
The Kologarn encounter has received the following changes: the speed of the Eyebeam has been decreased, the amount of damaged required to break a player from Stone Grip has been decreased, and slightly decreased the amount of damage done by Stone Grip.<br />
Some changes we have made to the trash mobs in the Antechamber (the area near Iron Council) are: the Devastating Leap from the Chamber Overseer is now a Stun Mechanic, Champer Overseers should no longer be immune to disarm, standing on the Flaming Rune should no longer proc Runic Explosion, Iron Menders should be immune to charm, Charged Dwarves should be immune to charm, the damage from Ball Lightning cast by Lightning Charged Iron Dwarves has been decreased in heroic difficulty, and the damage of Runed Flame Jets have been decreased.<br />
The Auriaya encounter has received the following changes: Sanctum Sentries should no longer spawn while Auriaya is in combat and lowered the damage of Savage Pounce.<br />
Sniper Training should no longer remove players from stealth.<br />
Death Strike will now heal the Death Knight for 5% of his or her maximum health per disease on the target, up to a maximum of 15%.<br />
Focus Magic and Hunger for Blood should no longer last through a talent switch.<br />
Vanish should now properly remove the effects of the Mage spell Slow.<br />
The Mimiron encounter has received the following changes: the damage of Proximity Mines has been decreased, Proximity Mines should no longer explode and damage players after they explode and disappear, the initial cooldown of Shock Blast in phase 4 has been altered so it shouldn't be cast the same time as Laser Barrage in this phase, the casting time of Self Repair has been increased, and the health and damage of Assault Bots has been decreased in heroic mode.<br />
Emalon should no longer use any of his special abilities for a short time after casting Overcharge.<br />
The time between Mole Machines spawning in the Razorscale encounter has been slightly increased.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/24x24/deathknight.jpg Death Strike Healing Nerf<br />
We have since made another hotfix to just change the way the healing works completely. It now heals 5% of the death knight's health per disease on the target, up to a max of 15%. This should allow Frost and Unholy to benefit from Death Strike healing while letting Blood benefit from extra Death Strike damage. The tooltip will not reflect this change until we can patch the client.<br />
<br />
Arena Season 6 - Starting Tomorrow<br />
According to today's blue post, the Season 6 of the Arena is still scheduled to start tomorrow on live servers!<br />
We have stated that players should expect season 6 to start as early as tomorrow. This is still the plan. <br />
<br />
Arena Season 6 – Upcoming Changes<br />
Now that Arena Season 6 is on the horizon, we wanted to share some details regarding upcoming changes to the arena rating system in Arena Season 6. With Arena Season 6, arena teams will start at 0 rating instead of 1500, which will allow teams to have more continuous progression throughout the arena season. In addition, we reevaluated item purchases and felt many of them were too difficult to obtain so we will be altering the rating requirements needed to purchase the latest arena items. For example, items with a rating requirement will now be obtainable starting at 1250 rating.<br />
<br />
As with the current system, the matchmaking system will attempt to match teams against opponents who are closest to their average matchmaking rating. Starting with Arena Season 6, a team’s average matchmaking rating will be shown in the scoreboard at the end of each match so that you can see where your team stands compared to the opposing team you just faced. All arena teams that are below a 1500 arena rating will always earn arena points as a 1500 rated team. This will allow teams to continue to build up arena points while working on gaining the ratings needed to purchase items.<br />
<br />
Please note that a more specific start date for Arena Season 6 will be provided as soon as it is determined.<br />
<br />
Here is a list of some PvP items that will be available in Arena Season 6 and their expected rating requirements:<br />
<br />
Rating Required:<br />
1250+: Deadly Relics/Idols/Librams/Totems <br />
1300+: Deadly Gloves<br />
1350+: Deadly Legs<br />
1400+: Deadly Chest<br />
1450+: Deadly Helm<br />
1500+: Deadly Shoulders<br />
<br />
1400+: Furious Bracer (honor)<br />
1450+: Furious Belt (honor)<br />
1500+: Furious Boots (honor)<br />
1550+: Furious Neck (honor)<br />
1600+: Furious Gloves<br />
1650+: Furious Ring (honor)<br />
1700+: Furious Legs<br />
1750+: Furious Chest<br />
1800+: Furious Trinket (honor)<br />
1850+: Furious Weapon<br />
1900+: Furious Helm<br />
1950+: Furious Wands/Relics/etc <br />
2000+: Furious Cloak (honor)<br />
2050+: Furious Shoulders<br />
2200+: 2nd Tier Furious Weapon<br />
2300+: Furious Tabard No Rating Required:<br />
Hateful Gloves<br />
Hateful Legs<br />
Hateful Chest<br />
Hateful Helm<br />
Hateful Shoulders<br />
Hateful Ring<br />
Hateful Trinket<br />
Deadly Bracer<br />
Deadly Belt<br />
Deadly Boots<br />
Deadly Neck<br />
Deadly Ring<br />
Deadly Cape<br />
Deadly Trinket<br />
<br />
To answer some players’ questions:<br />
Only the current arena season’s weapons (furious) will be available. Deadly weapons will be removed when Arena Season 6 starts.<br />
The first tier furious weapons will be equivalent to heroic Ulduar weapons and the second tier furious weapons will match heroic hard mode Ulduar weapons. <br />
<br />
Another thing to keep in mind is that until you start to get close to your team's matchmaking rating, you will be gaining around 20 or more points in a win and zero or nearly zero in a loss. So players will make steady progress through games played until they near their team's matchmaking rating. <br />
<br />

We do not have the stats of the weapons yet but we already know that the color of this new season is blue! <br />

If algalon is supposed to be harder than that... I dont even know if he would be possible. Or maybe they are overtuning mimiron hard mode because algalon isnt ready so he will just be a cockblock.</div></div><hr />

Then again, XT 002 hard mode? Correct me if I'm wrong, but you need to first down 25% of his health, then kill the heart, then he resets to full health, but with 45% additional health. This means, on heroic, he has 25M health. First take down 6,25 M health, then a heart with 7,5M health (takes 100% more damage, so roughly equivalent to 3,75M) then he heals to full, gets 45% additional health, so he has 36,25 M health. This means you have 46,25M health to burn down within enrage-timer, which I don't remember what was, 9 minutes? 8?<br />
And, does he stop to spawn adds then? Is tympanic tantrum and other abilities increased damage as well?<br />
This sounds like one really hard achievement.<br />
And don't even get me started on Mimiron.</div></div><hr />

Something about hard modes being hard.<br />
<br />
I'm sure the guilds actually doing these encounters will either: enjoy the challenge, agree that it's very difficult and continue trying, or agree that it's too difficult and discuss changes, which Blizzard will probably take to heart, to a degree. Any combination of those 3...</div></div><hr />

It would be nice, if Blizz would actually wait with the nerfing before ppl try the hard modes in Ulduar gear, and if the top guilds fail then also maybe then begin the nerfs. But i doubt it. Ignis was a bit harder than facerolling and Blizz did bend over asap and nerfed him to the ground. A simple fix of not meleeing the pot guy woulda been enough, but no..lets nerf him so there is no challenge left.</div></div><hr />

<br />
6 Minutes enrage.<br />
And the heart has 10m health, not 7.5m.<br />
<br />
So, 5 mil damage in 20 seconds. That's some heavy burst needed.<br />
<br />
Tantrum damage isn't increased, as it's % based, not damage.<br />
<br />
The main thing is that you need to take out:<br />
6.25 mil + 5 mil + 36,25 (25+45%) = 48,5 million health in 6 minutes.<br />
Meaning you need 134722,22 Raid DPS = 5388,88 DPS per raid member.<br />
<br />
Not &quot;too&quot; horrible. Aside the fact that you need to DPS down the adds as well.<br />
<br />
And, you can in theory extend the fight by 15-30 seconds if you spread out during the enrage.</div></div><hr />

Really though, I don't think that something that is too hard is fun at all. Something that is a little bit of a challenge is good, but it's too hard to get many people to do everything correctly. Like Sarth 3d, even with a bunch of guildies, you still get retards that get hit by the walls, void zones. And people that claim &quot;lag&quot;. Wiping for a couple of hours on one boss is not fun to me at all, no matter which boss it is. especially if it isn't something wrong that I am doing.</div></div><hr />

If you keep failing on a farm boss you need to either fix your guild (train/kick the people who repeatedly die) or move to a new guild. Seeing a boss go down for the first time with only couple of hours of wiping is no fun to me at all. Looking back, the best times are the ones where it took weeks of tries and tuning of the raid setup to down the final tier bosses.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, that's true, but you know how most guilds are nowadays. It's like a high school clique where there's people that are favored and won't be kicked out of the raid no matter what. Someone can say &quot;I had lag&quot; like 10 times and will just say &quot;I'll try to do better next time&quot; and that seems to be good enough for the raid leader. I'd suppose it would be very difficult for a small guild in that situation as well, but it's more frustrating when a guild seems to have a &quot;buddy system&quot; so to speak and the favored ones, no matter how bad or laggy they are, will be included in everything.<br />
<br />
So really, making things harder is tougher for the people who actually know what they are doing and don't have lag (real or fake). Yeah, I mean make things a little difficult, but making it so hard that there is no room for error or no room for anyone to die is a little bit extreme. Most guilds aren't like the top ones in the world that live and breathe raids and have the best computers in the world. I guess it just sucks to see people mess things up for bad reasons.<br />
<br />
But grats to those out there that actually have their shit together.</div></div><hr />

The main thing is that you need to take out:<br />
6.25 mil + 5 mil + 36,25 (25+45%) = 48,5 million health in 6 minutes.<br />
Meaning you need 134722,22 Raid DPS = 5388,88 DPS per raid member.<br />
<br />
Not &quot;too&quot; horrible. Aside the fact that you need to DPS down the adds as well.<br />
<br />
And, you can in theory extend the fight by 15-30 seconds if you spread out during the enrage.<br />
For some reason you dividing 134722.22 by 25 to reach the &quot;raid dps&quot; number makes me want to call you a retard really badly, but I'll be civil.<br />
You're obviously not going to have 25 DPS'ers. Let's assume 2 tanks (1 for XT, 1 for Pummelers), 6 healers, and 17 DPS. <br />
<br />
While factoring in 3k DPS for each of the two tanks (pretty generous as one isn't even on the boss most of the time), you get 7571 DPS. This obviously can change based on healers putting out an amount of damage, raid composition, or tanks doing more than 3k DPS. Even still, it seems like a pretty hard number to each, excluding the fact that there are adds to be dealt with. Plus, don't get in the mindset that well geared well played DPS can already do 7.5k -- that's with the heart active in all 3 phases.</div></div><hr />

They will most likely be available for straight honor, or a combination of both ( like the gloves (?) being available for 12,500 honor and 350 A.P ). So, it'll be your choice.</div></div><hr />

One solution to this problem is to macro your pet skills and have the macros on your bars instead (the button will just be greyed out until you do the respec, rather than having to go through the process of putting the skill back on the bar).</div></div><hr />

They only want PvPers who are accomplishing what they consider a successful rating to get a PvP weapon that's worth a damn in PvE. Every season that rating will not change but the weapons will get upgraded. Bottom line: Weapons are getting replaced, removed is more of a misnomer, though technically the weapons being named will be gone. All you need to worry about is if the rating for the tier 1 weapon will change season to season.</div></div><hr />

As if it matters, the entire list of pvp items including weapons look like garbage. Many people have alot of alts, having an intro decent set for the amount of time spent on getting it is fair, it doesn't mean that you are going to pounce your way all the way to the 2k+'s rating with it so I don't understand your concern.</div></div><hr />

This is just you bitching to hear the sound of your own voice. Do you REALLY care if the &quot;scrubs&quot; at 1500 and sub-1500 ratings have epic pvp gear? No, because if you have the skill you say you do, YOU WON'T BE MATCHED WITH THEM IN ARENAS ANYWAYS. ( Sorry mods, just trying to get the point across. ) Even in World PvP, if they do have 3 pieces of Deadly and some Hateful, skilled players are still going to be able to make short work of them. <br />

I'm sure the guilds actually doing these encounters will either: enjoy the challenge, agree that it's very difficult and continue trying, or agree that it's too difficult and discuss changes, which Blizzard will probably take to heart, to a degree. Any combination of those 3...<br />

It was sorta NERFED before today...they are just addressing the fact that they had nerfed it to &quot;take it off the bar FOREVER&quot; for unholy and frost.

<br />
What do you do if you're in a guild that fails on normal mode Ulduar bosses but then just gives up after a few tries? :( The guild I'm in is great - good players, they know what they're doing (mostly) and they have good gear. But we go into Ulduar, try one boss and wipe 3 or 4 times and then they go &quot;qq too hard let's try a diff boss&quot; and off we go to another boss, try that and wipe a few times and they go &quot;omg qq too hard let's go farm naxx for off spec gear&quot;. /wrists</div></div><hr />

<br />
This totally sums up my opinion of raiding in WoW. I don't like dieing because I didn't get heals for 15 seconds. I don't like wiping because the dps wasn't on part. I don't like dieing because the tank couldn't hold a mob. Very rarely am I the one actually creating the problem (how hard is it for a healer to move out of a void zone when I can do it with 20 mobs beating on me?). This is why I like the public quest system in WAR, in that system if you don't perform better than everyone else you usually don't get any loot (you still get a roll but you get a 500 bonus to the roll for being on top), and I normally come out on top in the PQs I have done so far.</div></div><hr />

Both of these are not always an option. In the end, you still need 25 people to do most content. It is better to have 25 people that are somewhat competent then 15 people that are completely competent. The best guilds on the server only have so many spots and they have a nasty habit of poaching from the guilds underneath them so most of the time what you are left with is a group of second class raiders that you have to make due with or simply not raid. The best guilds on the server can kick those people that don't measure up though as a luxury.</div></div><hr />

If they really feel the need to &quot;distinguish&quot; themselves from others in a bloody video game then I don't want to know what their real life is like. Ooh, look at me I beat Uludar hard mode.

You accept that Uludar was released over tuned and realize after a month of nerfs that allow more casual players to see the whole dungeon your guild will start focusing on it. Personally, I spent one night in there wiping on Ignis trash then Ignis (where the tank died in 2 hits) and took a week off from raiding.</div></div><hr />

Oh my god, that is exactly what I say. It's like hey... I'm healing eeeeeveryone, running around missing everything that's coming at me, and checking to make sure a void zone doesn't come up on me.
