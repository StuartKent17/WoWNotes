05/19<br />
Innervate now properly restores the correct amount of mana to Shapeshifted targets that do not have a mana bar active.<br />
Thrust and Shield-Break attacks in the Argent Tournament are correctly being mitigated by the number of Defends that are active on the target.<br />
The Supercharged ability on Storm Tempered Keepers near Auriaya will no longer increase the damage of Storm Wave.<br />
Some of the trash mob packs have been removed in the areas leading to Ignis the Furnace Master and Freya.<br />
In the tunnel leading to Mimiron, the Clockwork Sapper’s Ice Turret's ability, Ice Nova, now does considerably less damage in both difficulty modes.<br />
In the Antechamber leading to the Assembly of Iron, the Rune Etched Sentry's ability, Flaming Rune, does considerably less damage over time in both difficulty modes.<br />
The Molten Colossus near Ignis the Furnace Master will no longer cast Unquenchable Flames.<br />

Some issues were fixed and Algalon the Observer should now properly reset every time a raid wipes.<br />
The hit point increasing hard mode ability for XT-002 Deconstructor has been reduced to 50% in the 10 player Normal setting, and 60% in the 25 player Heroic setting. The corresponding damage increase for XT-002 has also been reduced to 15%. Life Sparks also have half of their previous hit point values.<br />
The engineering boot enchant, Nitro Boosts, will no longer be usable in rated or skirmish arena matches.<br />
The duration of Kologarn's Crunch Armor effect has been greatly reduced in normal difficulty. This change negates the explicit need to tank swap Kologarn.<br />
Thorim's Chain Lightning will no longer affect more than 8 targets in normal and heroic difficulty.<br />
General Vezax now does 10% less melee damage in normal difficulty.<br />
<br />
Ulduar Tuning (May 19 2009)<br />
The following are a list of changes that have been hotfixed to 3.1.2 or are in the process of being hotfixed. All changes are to both 10 and 25 player versions of the instance, unless specifically noted.<br />
<br />
Trash<br />
Storm Tempered Keeper’s Supercharged ability will no longer increase the damage of Storm Wave.<br />
Some Ignis and Freya trash has been removed. If your instance was already open when the hotfix was applied, the trash will still be there.<br />
Ice Turret’s Ice Nova spell now does considerably less base damage.<br />
Rune Etched Sentry’s Flaming Rune does does considerably less damage over time.<br />
The Molten Colossus will no longer cast Unquenchable Flames.<br />
Chamber Overseer’s Staggering Roar does considerably less damage.<br />
<br />
Bosses<br />
Kologarn’s Crunch Armor effect of his Overhead Smash now has a greatly decreased duration in the 10 player Normal difficulty setting. This change negates the explicit need to tank swap Kologarn.<br />
Thorim’s Chain Lightning no longer affects more than 8 targets.<br />
General Vezax now does 10% less melee damage in the 10 player Normal difficulty setting.<br />
<br />
Hard Modes<br />
The hit point increasing hard mode ability for XT-002 Deconstructor has been reduced to 50% in the 10 player Normal setting, and 60% in the 25 player Heroic setting. The corresponding damage increase for XT-002 has also been reduced to 15%. Life Sparks also have half of their previous hit point values.<br />
<br />
In an unrelated tuning note, we also found a case where Algalon would not reset properly in the 25 player Heroic setting only. This has been hotfixed. <br />
<br />
Ulduar Item Updates<br />
The following items have had their stats improved in patch 3.1.2 to match their appropriate item level:<br />
Icecore staff<br />
Boreal Guard<br />
Malice<br />
<br />
The following weapons have had their speed changed to make them more optimized when used in PvE content compared to equivalent weapons obtained in the Arena:<br />
Golden Saronite Dragon<br />
Remorse<br />
Stonerender<br />
Voldrethar, Dark Blade of Oblivion<br />
Dark Edge of Depravity<br />
Aesir's Edge<br />
Hammer of Crushing Whispers<br />
Caress of Insanity<br />
<br />
The dps of the ranged weapons listed below has been increased due to not having an equivalent ammunition upgrade. Please visit this thread for more details: http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=17223144541&amp;sid=1 (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=17223144541&amp;sid=1)<br />

Improving hunter dps through ranged weapons<br />
The developers believe hunter dps is too low, so today we are implementing a change to ranged weapon damage to improve dps across the board.<br />
<br />
Bows, crossbows and guns of item level 226 or higher (which means weapons from Kel'Thuzad, Ulduar and the Furious Gladiator pieces) will do around 30 more dps. This should translate to a hunter damage increase of a few percent.<br />
<br />
We don't think this will be quite sufficient in boosting hunter dps to where we think it needs to be and we have another buff that we plan to get in sometime over the next couple of weeks. We'll announce that change when it gets closer. (We have some plans for other classes as well, but we ask that you please keep this thread on the topic of hunters and the ranged weapon changes.)<br />
<br />
As hunters may recall, we had an ambitious plan to change the way ammo worked for 3.1 that ended up being overly ambitious, causing us to scale back. However as part of that change, we stopped itemizing bullets and arrows. Since hunters could not upgrade from the ammo available at the launch of Lich King, their damage had started and would continue to fall behind as other classes upgraded their gear. This change basically incorporates the ammo damage into the weapons -- as you get better ranged weapons, it's as if you got better ammo to go along with them. This is likely to be a design we continue for the next few tiers of content until we have the opportunity to overhaul ammo completely.</div></div><hr />

... You've just answered yourself to why they took it away... really engeneering is not just a profession that is essentially for PvP it is so good that PvP CALLS for Engeneering.<br />
<br />
That means that in order to all be equivalent in PvP one of their professions SHOULD be engeering since no other profession gives such tools as engeneering. Other professions BUFF YOUR STATS. They don't make you shoot 2k beam or run to save your life or see stealth better. Buffing stats is one thing, buffing your utility, Burst, survivability is another.<br />
<br />
Another thing is certain too, Blizzard SHOULD buff Engeneering for PvE definately.</div></div><hr />

What sucks even more is that I'm a hunter, and the only reason I leveled engineering in the first place was for those PvP boot boost, and the Ammo I could make, also the Mote Extractor. Other than that, its all It can do. I mean damn I could make more money farming ore and prospecting it as a JC</div></div><hr />

Disable all class Racials in Arena. If you want to be the best in PVP you roll the best Class/Professions. Nerfing Engineering isn't going to stop that. You will just see people converting now to JC/ENCH. Which will lead to the same cry babies that have PVE Class/Professions because they arent Pure PVP'ers. &quot;Waaahh I have to use a Blue Gem in my gear and i don't want to!&quot;<br />
<br />
Maybe i am bias to my views because i too am one of the people that leveled engineering 2 weeks ago spending roughly 3k. But that wasn't because i felt the NEED to do it. I just have JC on all of my Toons so i felt like a change.</div></div><hr />

I understand that Blizzard wants to &quot;show cool content&quot; to as many people as possible, but why cant that be a 10man template? IMO TBC had VERY well balanced difficulties on instances ... SSC/TK/Hyjal/BT were all what normal raiders would qualify as &quot;hard&quot;. Sunwell being &quot;very hard&quot;. And then later they nerfed the whole instance down with a big content patch and everyone were able to access them without prequests etc. And i really liked the &quot;TBC way&quot; better.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The profession is horribly implemented, offers huge Arena boons but aside from the Glove Haste offers little to no PvE assistance. However, now 2 of the 3 reasons it was so nice in arena have been removed in less than a weeks time, effectively crippling it as a viable profession for anyone who plays the game consistently. <br />
<br />
Shit its not even a fun profession anymore without the addition of new helms/boots/trinkets like Vanilla Engineering offered.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying the Arena advantages shouldn't have been nerfed, just that Engineering definitely deserves PvE boosts in place of these nerfs but Blizzard has shown time and time again that they don't seem to give a shit about this profession.</div></div><hr />

But is it fair to leave all enigneers with..practically nothing now?<br />

Just give engineers two extra sockets to their ranged slot or a 64AP (or equivalent values of other stats) &quot;Enchant&quot; on the Neck and remove the Rocket/Accelerators from Arena too and everything's fine.</div></div><hr />

Technical reasons was stated for the ammo change not being implemented now. I was hoping for something like this as there are several instance drops of ammo that are quite useless with the current system, with getting 50-200 every other boss kill.. To be fair, they are pre-tbc and not of any use now, but here are the best ones:<br />

although with the introduction of<br />

at the start of tbc they are now completely obsolete. Hopefully it won't be too difficult to get the ammo if they implement such a system. Although I think I'd rather have arrows/bullets with stats, like armor piercing, agility, explosive damage..</div></div><hr />

so they WILL NERF EVERY RAID THAT COME OUT AFTER A WHILE, how in gods name is that hard to understand?<br />
if you are complaining that uld is gonna be easy, blame your self for not clearing it all pre-nerfs, or simply stop going<br />
there are easy mode (they are easy mode... you should be able to down them &quot;easily&quot;), and there are hard mode, they will nerf hard modes to the point that certain % of guilds can down them, lower than that certain % is unacceptable (ofc after giving ppl enough time to experiment and really try to down the bosses), so expect further &quot;tuning down&quot; for bosses and stop whining about that<br />
<br />
eng is still usable in world pvp and BGs as far as i know, good enough if you got eng for &quot;pvping&quot; not for &quot;arena&quot; only, give them some time to work on eng and try to fix the problems then re-enable them in arena, they wont let you have a &quot;broken&quot; toy to play with and hurt others while they are trying to fix it, you are naughty kids, take broken toy away, fix it, then return it</div></div><hr />

another Ulduar nerfs are /sigh<br />

Seriously 10 man was way too hard for the casual players. Blizzard noticed this, that's why it's nerfed.<br />
<br />
Looks like those of us that don't want to spend 10 hours a day, everyday raiding (like Ensidia) to see end game content might actually get to see Arthas.<br />
<br />
IMO 10 mans should be &quot;significantly easier&quot; than 25s. I don't agree with the 25 man nerfs, but the 10 mans are needed.</div></div><hr />

I would very much like to hear a reason as to why this change was made. A proffession avalible to everyone with some nice feats for Arena PvP just gets nered so hard there is no point in having it at all. I get the stealth detection thing on googles but the NB nerf is way to much imo. Why don´t you ban all benefits from all professions then, so we can go on without wasting our time and money for absolutely nothing.</div></div><hr />

no idea what fotmers mean.. and i had skinning/lw since i started playin 2 years ago. skinning was useless for me at a time so i decided to try smth new and since i had mats from mining of another char i decided to lvl crafting prof, these were JC or Engi. i just made the wrong choice so stfu</div></div><hr />

We have plans to make certain that this item is still worth the investment made in it. So don't vendor it just yet.<br />

Next patch they ll add Stealth Detection on Nitro Boots, mark my words!</div></div><hr />
