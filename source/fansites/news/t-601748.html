<meta name="description" content="Nethaera answered a question about gear swapping in Arena, I don't know if this has been confirmed before but it's not like we've got tons of news to cover lately.  
 
Question 
&quot;Hey Neth, The feature to prevent gear-swapping in arenas is not slated to go live with the next content patch, right?&quot; 
 
Answer 
Correct. It IS coming though. It's just not in the next patch.

Events next week<br />
As I said, news are kinda slow lately, hopefully next week will be better with two events.<br />
The [url=http://www.thewsvg.com/events/info/9/]WSVG in Toronto (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=965654657&amp;pageNo=1&amp;sid=1#5) featuring a WoW tournament with a 30,000$ cash prize for the winner. <br />
The Leipzig Games Convention (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Games_Convention) featuring ... a Wrath of the Lich King trailer ! (Yeah, remember the nice leak (http://www.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2007/july/wotlkrating.jpg)). If we're lucky enough maybe we'll get more informations about the expansion here, stay tuned. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, on PvPScene.com<br />
Hunter and Micro Management (http://www.pvpscene.com/index.php#post_h_mm)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
First: Sry for my bad english.<br />
Second: I think you´re gettin´ something wrong here. Today you are able to switch gear while in a arena (e.g. with Outfitter). Blizzard has plans to stop this! They don´t want you to be able to switch gear in the Arena just by gettin out of combat for some seconds.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Legionn</div><div class="date">2007-08-18, 09:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Really, never thought of trying that cause I hardly ever get out of combat long enough to even think about changing gear.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Durahal</div><div class="date">2007-08-18, 11:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Too many locks and shadow priest were complaining about warrs swapping to shadow resist gear ::)<br />
<br />
Lets just hope the Resilience buff makes up for this, lol. :P<br />
<br />
Anyone know if this applies to only armor or weapons also?<br />
<br />
EDIT: Spelling</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shadowclaimer</div><div class="date">2007-08-18, 02:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Its to prevent druids or anyone basically from running back to your starting area, swapping to alternate gear, then doing something completely different (swapping into feral gear etc.)</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">eternity</div><div class="date">2007-08-18, 02:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Too many locks and shadow priest were complaining about warrs swapping to shadow resist gear ::)<br />
<br />
<br />
well i would have said in general : too many players knowing the opposite team switched fast their gear accordingly (+200shadow or fire, frost, regen stuff, stamina stuff)</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">elixir</div><div class="date">2007-08-18, 06:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Damn i cant do this on my rogue any more....poooooo :-*</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Durahal</div><div class="date">2007-08-19, 01:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So... anyone know if this is going to affect changing weapons at all, or just armor?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Legionn</div><div class="date">2007-08-19, 06:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There's shouldn't be any reason for the weapons not being able to be switched out. I mean how in the hell would warriors be able to use our abilities if we weren't able to switch from sword &amp; board to dual wield/2hander.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thiago</div><div class="date">2007-08-19, 07:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Cool, gear swapping still working, dots affected by resilience, what is coming next?<br />
<br />
Man, seriously, I'll reroll my warlock soon as I can while he still usefull on arena...</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shadowclaimer</div><div class="date">2007-08-19, 12:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Why the heck would a warlock have to gear swap? o.O<br />
<br />
If anything you should be happy, no more shadow resist swapouts...</div></div><hr />
