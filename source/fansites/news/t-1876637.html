The Blizzcon schedule hasn't been officially announced yet, but it doesn't appear to have the previously mentioned Engineering panel (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/5177-Blizzcon-Engineering-Panel-Item-Hotfixes-Tweets-DLC-507). You can see Friday (http://us.battle.net/blizzcon/en/event-info/schedule/friday) and Saturday (http://us.battle.net/blizzcon/en/event-info/schedule/saturday) listings on the official site.<br />

If its not officially announced so far, how can MMO-champ have the schedule? Is this made up?<br />

It really DOES look made up. Diablo 3 is long overdue for the next expansion and you are trying to tell me they only have 1 panel for it? As if!</div></div><hr />

No diablo news.<br />
State of the Game - Heroes. Having more panels than diablo is a good sign, so no issues.<br />
warcraft movie trailer and legion cinematic.<br />
<br />
I think Diablo and Starcraft will go into slumber mode till Starcraft 3 and Diablo 4.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Last year had 6 Warcraft related panels, but that includes Movie and the Looking for Group documentary.<br />
WoW specifically was only the Items/Class/etc Panel, Live Raid, Cinematic and Q&amp;A, so yeah, only Live Raid is missing, and we got the Engineering panel instead, which might be interesting.<br />
<br />
2013 had a few more, including Art and Sound panels, which were kind of fun to watch if you like that sort of thing.<br />

<br />

There are 5 hours dedicated to WoW and 2 for Overwatch<br />
<br />
The real question is how selfish do you have to be to want a company to lose millions of dollars and for hundreds of thousands of potential fans to lose something that could be great just because you aren't interested in it?!?!?!?!??!?!?!??!?!?!?!?!<br />

State of the Game - Heroes. Having more panels than diablo is a good sign, so no issues.<br />
warcraft movie trailer and legion cinematic.<br />
<br />
I think Diablo and Starcraft will go into slumber mode till Starcraft 3 and Diablo 4.<br />
<br />
I think they just have nothing new to talk about the movie. You had Blizzcon, you had Comicon, probably we will have a trailer, then thats it, wait till summer</div></div><hr />

Keep your 4chan/twitch-chat talk to yourself.<br />

I am saying there isnt enough content to justify 40 EUR, that is then better invested in an actual game if they have nothing to reveal or show.<br />
Besides, they did not even announce which band will be at the ending ceremony, so there is that.</div></div><hr />

Debatable. If people feel there is enough there to satisfy them then they are getting their moneys worth. Can see where you are coming from though I was personally expecting more D3 stuff.</div></div><hr />

Seemingly no Diablo 3 Announcement<br />
It appears all to be about RNGstone and Heroes of the Storm<br />
Missing WoW Movie Panel<br />
What appears to be only some &quot;Dev talks&quot; in most sections<br />
Non existant announcement as to what Band is going to be at the closing ceremony, this is a huge point as well. No one cares about Sams self service &quot;Level X ETC&quot; or about some punk-ass band like two years ago!<br />
No real announcements</div></div><hr />

1 and 3. Yes admittedly I'm disappointed to. But who knows about D3 until it actually gets going. <br />
5 and 6. Opinions.<br />
2. I'd say more WoW and Heroes personally. Starcraft having a lot makes sense since fans will want to know where the game is going.<br />
4. There's like 1 dev talk.<br />
<br />
Some of these I can agree with you on the others are purely your own opinion which fair enough but don't enforce it as if it's fact. Sorry for not numbering them in order btw just lazy today :)</div></div><hr />

Mainly I believe so. Let me explain how they do it, from what I know. Chaud get whatever news Blizzard want out, he creates a test post in the mod section to preview the news and look for errors, then publish to the front page a matter of minutes or hours later.</div></div><hr />

Me too, but it appears we wont see one or even a cinematic. I am going to uninstall Diablo 3 right now actually. I am not putting up with this.<br />

Could you be any more of a selfish, whiny attention whore? Yes, there is other stuff that both yourself and myself would rather see, but this is what they planned for Blizzcon, and it's not going to change. You might also want to work on your math. WoW and Starcraft appear to be more predominant.</div></div><hr />

You chose to buy them. Uninstalling it over something that isn't confirmed is silly imo. And you know they won't show a cinematic during the opening ceremony how?. You don't just like I don't know if they won't. Absolute speculation.</div></div><hr />

Yes, speculation.<br />

But I choose what I am going to play. And if they are not going to bring anything about, then I have no reason to keep playing these games or god forbid watch that Blizzcon PPV.<br />

While I would love to see a new D3 expansion, it seems unlikely given the current RoS patch cycle. If they stick to the current patch pattern, 2.4 won't be out until April 2016. That being said, development on an expansion wouldn't pick up until after that. (Now unless they have seperate teams for patches and expansions, which I doubt given how small the D3 team is.) I don't think we'll see an expansion annoucement until one of the gaming expos mid-2016.</div></div><hr />

Again opinion. It doesn't change the fact it has become vastly popular and profitable for Blizzard since release. So the sarcasm again pointless because the lack of interest is based of your personal opinion and in no way enforces the games profitability or player numbers.</div></div><hr />

Don't then. Nobody asked you to support Blizz and it is fine if you don't want to. All I'm saying is stop acting like facts aren't facts because you have a personal issue with something.

They always leave time for the opening ceremony to go long, which it usually does. If you look, there's a 30 min gap between every panel, this is so attendees actually have time to do other stuff between panels.<br />
<br />
What's worrying about this is that it almost puts a nail in the coffin for a Diablo 3 expansion, since there's only 1 panel about it.</div></div><hr />

Or starcraft 2 ? I personally love blizzard for these games and that we sit on them for so long , sure they will lose numbers but remembering we already have given our money to get the game at this point. They have scrapped projects in the past and aren't like EA or Activision with CoD , if they decide to do yearly wow expansions I think it would be a bad thing on their behalf, content sitting is fine so long as the next content is not a polished turd and they try selling it off as new chocolate bar. <br />
<br />
I got my ticket and they could still be changing things for all I know , like the post said, no engineering panel when they have said their would be this year. <br />

Well who knows? We could obviously go towards Starcraft 3 but there are other possibilities such as a Starcraft MMO. Highly unlikely but take it into consideration at least since LotV is supposed to be ending the Starcraft 2 saga.</div></div><hr />

No Diablo time, even without an announcement Diablo balance and lore talk is far more interesting that hots.<br />
<br />
Starcraft should have got a lot more love than they did - they are the next expansion launch why are they not pushing that instead of a piss poor card game? <br />
<br />
Seems Blizzcon is in a bit of a shambles tbh. This isn't the Blizzard I fell in love with, this is a profit hungry no depth or soul company.<br />
<br />
3 panels dedicated to SC is more than enough.</div></div><hr />

<br />
WoW - 4 <br />
Hearthstone - 2<br />
HoTS - 3<br />
Starcraft 2 - 3<br />
Overwatch - 2<br />
Diablo 3 - 1<br />
<br />
Which is pretty much what I was expecting, a shift away from being so much focused on wow and still some attention to wow but a move to more on the other IPs. Only 2 for Hearthstone is a bit surprising but not overly, since there isn't a ton to talk about with HS other than new coming cards or planned expansions. SC2 having 3 is a bit surprising also, but understandable I guess with that new expansion around the corner. And lastly, D3 only getting 1 panel is pretty notable.</div></div><hr />

You're reading it wrong, unless you're talking about the blocks of tournament play and stuff.<br />

The Panels, however, are 3 hours total for HotS, and 2 hours for Hearthstone.</div></div><hr />

That's where the Warcraft movie trailer will be shown and the Diablo 3 expansion announcement (if it even happens which is likely). There's no need for extra panel for a movie when there's a major expansion for WoW coming out, they need to talk about it more than a movie they already talked about and will technically talk about it way more through the trailer itself. Just because an expansion is being announced (Diablo) doesn't mean there will be a panel about it (Dev Talk could be the one, it will get renamed after the announcement like every other time ever, or it's missing from the schedule like Overwatch was missing last year until announced.). You guys are literally overthinking and analyzing a freakin' schedule, which ALWAYS ends up changing minutes after the Con starts because of the opening ceremony announcements. Like, is this your first Blizzcon or something?</div></div><hr />

<br />
couple things, they have already talked alot about SC2 LoV, it comes out shortly after Blizzcon, there isnt much left to talk about as far as whats coming. its the last expansion for the game.<br />
<br />
hearthstone and HoTS are growing fast and are very popular games.<br />
<br />
also, those blocks probably arnt the full blocks, they are probably place holders. you mentioned no d3, the likely answer is that the next d3 expansion is going to be announced, and they are reserving some space. last year we had a bunch of unfilled time and it turned out to be over watch.</div></div><hr />

Why even uninstall? Are you trying to save space on your hard drive? Uninstalling doesn't matter to Blizzard. You already paid for the game. You continually get free updates to the game, too. Why anyone would complain about Diablo3 is beyond me. I have thousands of hours in the Diablo games that only cost me a little over a hundred dollars.

Underlined: I disagree. Diablo 3 is in a pretty strong place right now. RoS fixed most of the issues people had with the initial release and Blizz have constantly added requested features over the last few patches (Seasons, Cube and new tile sets/locations, to name a few). Bearing in mind people were/still are playing D2 for the longest time, even with a lack of content updates (after LoD), D3 is doing fine. The only issue it has is the current problems with coding and high GRift runs, which was being focused on in the last PTS.<br />
<br />
Bolded: In what sense? There aren't that many heroes that are best in slot on every map, regardless of skill level. Kael and Kharazim are the only ones that spring to mind, but Kael can be countered and Kharazim can be banned/first picked.<br />
<br />

Although I firmly believe Blizzard have decided to cut down on what they divulge before games now as they shot themselves in the foot for WOD but at the same time, these panels and this announcement is extremely depressing for Wow fans. Is that all they will spend talking about Wow? Really, really depressing and just shows their focus is on the FTP games. Which is even more depressing. Blizzard are becoming the next EA unfortunately. Sure they are a business, but the business model they are chasing hurts us in the long run. I refuse to this day to play anything F2P.</div></div><hr />

No we aren't insulting you for your taste you are by all means entitled to that. Just half of your early posts were forcing your opinion as fact when the case was it was a personal issue. Eg your joker sarcasm response to someone stating the popularity and profitability of hearthstone. You can by all means dislike Hearthstone fair enough. Just accept that it is a very popular and very profitable game for them because that isn't opinion.<br />

I do not understand this comment at all! Wow have the most stage events with 4. Majority of them on the main stage and the main event right after the opening ceremony! We all know that the big game at every Blizzcon is the one presented on the one hour and a half main stage event right after the opening ceremony.

It's a possibility but they wont put that directly into the schedule itself. Same with Overwatch people are expecting something there. Like example it could be in one of the WoW panels or the opening ceremony they possibly mention the Legion Beta.</div></div><hr />

SC2 Panels<br />
Well. Technically, there's only 1 Starcraft Panel which discusses the game-play.<br />
Every year Blizzard does a Sound Panel as well as an Art Panel. Usually, they pick WoW art and sound team to explore this. This year, they are going to use the SC2 team for it. I am really excited to see more SC2 art work. <br />
<br />
D3 Panel<br />
Diablo-3 having only one panel really sucks. D3, as a game, is in a good place right now. It is finally the game it was meant to be. And it loads of fun. A second panel on the future of D3 would have been awesome. <br />
<br />
HoTs Panels<br />
I really don't see why they need 3 HOTs panels. I guess I am not a fan of HoTs. <br />
<br />
4 WoW panels<br />
Well.. I am a massive WoW fan. So, I would have loved it if all the panels were WoW panels :) So opinion in this case might be biased. However, key thing missing from this year's WoW panels is a separate raid panel and a class panel. Since some of the classes are getting critical redesigns (e.g. hunters and warlocks), I would love to know what their plans are for the less popular classes like shamans and monks. <br />
<br />
<br />
World of Warcraft: Legion - World and Content Overview --&gt; Sounds a like very generic high level overview of Legion. A short cinematic + some slides (very similar to what they showed before). I don't see a lot of new data in this panel<br />
<br />
World of Warcraft Cinematics - The Road to Legion --&gt; This appears to be more of a lore based panel. Should be interesting from a lore POV. Once again will lack new data about Legion.<br />
<br />
World of Warcraft: Legion - Game Systems --&gt; This should be an interesting panel. Hopefully they have interesting info on raiding, non-raiding game systems here. This is perhaps the only panel to look forward to in the WoW section of things.<br />
<br />
Q/A --&gt; Depends on the questions asked. They are generally so condescending to the people who ask the questions, that I usually find this section rather annoying.</div></div><hr />

Who knows maybe we will just get the cinematic during the opening ceremony when they usually reveal all? And then snippets of info throughout the year and at other gaming events. But yeah looks doubtful at the moment.</div></div><hr />

On the other hand it's good to see WoW still has the major spotlight. Considering Blizzard now has 2 more games in the field, it seems like in the near future 2 days won't be enough to contain coverage for all Blizzard Games.<br />
<br />
Getting ready to say the same thing. It's a shame that D3 isn't getting some spotlight. D3 is under rated right now, it's better than D2 by far.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gadzooks</div><div class="date">2015-10-09, 06:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">They've waited long enough as is, honestly. It's been out for over a year and a half.<br />
<br />
And there was a two year gap between the release of the game and the expansion. I don't get all of this anger over no announcement for Diablo III. The game is doing fine. They've been releasing patches that other companies would charge for. Season 3 is rocking along great - I'd like the season to last a bit to get some of the good stuff, and possibly a season after that, before they dump any new classes or zones on us. I don't power level for 12 hours a day, I'd like a little more time to get things done. <br />
<br />
Besides, something IS coming. They're hiring for something new, it's on their careers page, an unannounced Diablo III project - most likely an expansion. So it's not being announced at Blizzcon - boo hoo. Legion is in the spotlight this year, it's to be expected. Can we stop with the whinging and &quot;They're abandoning the game!&quot; comments? It's stupid.<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
So i was hoping for Legion closed beta announcement, and chance for ppl whos attending Blizzcon to actually try out beta. Or am i missing something?<br />
<br />
That will be announced in the Opening ceremony, if it is announced. <br />
<br />
The only panel I'm curious about is the The Future Of Starcraft panel - if they're dedicating that much time to it, they have a plan, and I've been wondering what they're gonna do. They have a kick ass team there, be a shame to split them up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
People here have a terrible taste for wording, thinking they are entitled to insult me just because I do not agree with Blizzard's decisions in how they are supposedly setting up this Blizzcon.<br />
<br />
The schedule is a deal breaker for me. Why would I buy the cat in the bag? WoD was already a terrible decision, there is absolutely no plausible reason I should trust Blizzard again.<br />
<br />
And do not start with &quot;faith&quot;, I am not some person who buys blindly in to things.<br />
<br />
I am passionate about the games I play. WoW and Diablo 3 / HOTS to name some.<br />
<br />
But recently, WoW has lost nearly all of my interest because of what Blizzard dared to do with the latest expansion and Diablo 3 is not in a particularly great shape either.<br />
<br />
Heroes of the Storm is fun, but needs more balancing to be done.<br />
<br />
And hey, according to you blind fanboys, it is okay for Blizzard to start slacking on their established franchises just to feed you with F2P games. #VALVe<br />
<br />
Have you even stopped for a second and considered that MAYBE just MAYBE the game is dying a bit faster because of Hearthstone, Diablo 2.3, HOTS etc i mean with that attitude how do you even know that your personal favorite expansion would suffice? In the end alot of ppl are tired of Wow, those are the facts. Maybe just maybe has your Wow soul died and you are crying because you cant live with the fact that this is true. Step back a little and fucking take a good look at yourself, maybe you will realise that you have outgrown the game? Jesus christ man how little love do you get in life?<br />

Well, hate to say it - but as i always say - Blizzcon is about promoting their products... And D3 right now is making Blizz the least amount of money. WoW/HS/HotS all make more than just the box sales, sc2 expac is just comming out - so that is the big focus, and overwatch is a gamble in hoping to launch a new franchise/cash cow.<br />
<br />
Edit: of course a new D3 expac would do this wonders... But im feeling they may have just written off D3 for the time being..</div></div><hr />

Are you really trying to take the moral high ground after an entire page of trolling? Not this page btw. I said that because you decided to link a closing ceremony that was live.

Exactly just people expecting things they want to be there and throwing a paddy because it isn't. Warcraft movie is done apart from editing/cuts all we really need is a trailer.

1. Assumptions are like assholes. They make an ass out of you and me. <br />

well for diablo, i think alot of ppl are done whit ros, ppl need new contet, alot of streamers and utubers have called that blizzcon 15 new d3 exp, so alot of ppl already jumped on the hype train month ago, now that all points towards no expack alot of ppl me including are a bit bummed down, rly hope i get shocked and they atleast teases us something about a xpack cause the game really needs a new class and act to fresh things up,<br />
<br />
What you are saying is confusing to me. They just added a whole new system into the game, plus a new map, plus a new mode in season 4. Why would people be tired of it now? Plus the game is finally stabilizing a little bit. It's changed dramatically for a very long time. I think it would be nice to slow down the pace a little bit and let things settle down. <br />
<br />
Besides, why would anyone expect a second expansion? D1 and D2 were both one and done and then enjoyed a long life of small, steady updates. They didn't even have anything like seasons to freshen things up a little.</div></div><hr />

My money is on Diablo 4, which will likely be an action MMO along the lines of Lineage Eternal: Twilight Resistance, TBR in 2016.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It hasn't been basically WoW since 2007 when they announced SC2 and Diablo 3 in 2008 both of which got a hell of a lot of focus. So 2005 is the only time WoW has basically been the only thing as you put it.</div></div><hr />

*Cry* they dont show what I want and they put focus on games I dont like....<br />
Ya im looking at you &quot;Lillyth&quot;<br />
You must learn that ppl have diffrent opinion... HS and HotS &quot;should&quot; be the main focus right now as HS is growing fast and HotS is the next on the list to &quot;work&quot; with imo. Then we have Overwatch thast will be released later that need some focus.<br />
And as always WoW, still the main game.<br />
<br />
For myself I only &quot;care&quot; about StarCraft and Diablo, as im not intrested in the other games and tired of wow. But I understand that Diablo dont get as much focus as its in a good state and not really much to work with more then updates/patche's but I would love to see a expansion in the future maybe<br />
Starcraft will have the focus needed.<br />
<br />
But do I cry about this that they show much about things I dont really care about? No!... guess why... People think diffrently and I understand why blizzard focus on this things instead.<br />
And if they would put major talk about all games they would need 1-2 more days. You know, more games = more time ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Doubtful, unless it's in an already announced event on the main stage, or during the opening ceremony. The overwatch panel was right after the opening ceremony, on the main stage - a new game would follow that. There's a 45 minute gap between the starcraft and wow cinematic panels. I wouldn't get your hopes up for a new game or franchise.<br />
<br />
The one hour opening is just enough for a recap of all games, a beta announcement for WoW and Overwatch, and the movie trailer. Then they go right into Legion. Legion is getting the most time per slot all day - Legion will be the focus. <br />
<br />
They haven't been hiring for any unannounced games other than a Diablo 3 project, either.<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
Who knows maybe we will just get the cinematic during the opening ceremony when they usually reveal all? And then snippets of info throughout the year and at other gaming events. But yeah looks doubtful at the moment.<br />
<br />
Or, they're not ready to announce one, and will announce it when they're ready, at a game conference in 2016. Gives them reason to book more gaming events. After revealing Legion in Germany, I wouldn't assume every new title will be announced at Blizzcon. They now have all year to do it, if they want. The precedent has been set. <br />
<br />
The one thing you can't say is that D3 is &quot;abandoned&quot;. They just dropped a large patch with season 4 that has a ton of new stuff, and they're still tweaking the game - they have a stress test going on the PTR because they found some new tech to make the game run better - doesn't sound like an abandoned game to me.<br />
<br />
I'm gonna predict that they'll hint towards a new expansion at Blizzcon, possibly reveal the next patch with a bunch of new things for the next season. Season 4 is only what, 5 weeks old? And it should last 3-4 months? And everyone is saying it's overdue for an expansion? ROS was two years after D3 dropped, they have 6 more months before you can claim it's &quot;overdue&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Then those people are at fault for getting themselves hyped up for an announcement that wasn't going to happen. In what universe would it make sense for them to have multiple panels for an expansion that put up a STILL ONGOING search for a new Art Director, for said expansion, only 2 months ago? (Source: http://www.diablofans.com/news/48488-season-3-ending-and-season-4-starting-date). If they're still looking for someone to take charge of the Art (which is usually one of the first things to be focused on), then thinking they would have an all singing, all dancing unveiling is the height of foolishness.1</div></div><hr />

Clearly people do otherwise there wouldn't be other threads for these games. Overwatch, Hearthstone, Heroes and Diablo all have their own sub forum and SC2 has a Megathread.

The point is a lot of people on this forum were expecting a ton of new features and info about legion to be dumped in Blizzcon and it's funny to watch them squirm with the realization there won't be any new info. They'll just talk about what they already talked about at gamescon.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because they mentioned so many actual features at the gamecon? That doesn't even offer much to cut away from... Maybe a zone or dungeon if you really want to find something remotely realistic.<br />
I'm sure the Blizzcon will release a similar amount of information than any other Blizzcon that coincided with a new expansion, if not more since they already announced a couple months before.<br />
<br />
There is a 90 minute indepth preview panel, and 60 minutes of proper Q&amp;A, thats about the same raw time slots we pretty much always had. 2013, which announced WoD, had art and sound panels on top of that ... but while those were neat to look at, they didn't actually reveal anything new.<br />
<br />
But we'll just have to wait 4 more weeks and see, won't we.</div></div><hr />

The movie is essentially complete. Would probably be hard to talk about it without spoiling it at this point. We know which characters are in it and the backstory a bit. And when did they promise this?. Provide a source.</div></div><hr />

Seems highly unlikely. Gamescon was purposely kept vague and simple because they didn't want to announce anything they'd have to change, like with WoD. Chances are in the months since then they've got a better idea of what they want and can do, so we should get more information on what to expect.<br />
<br />
There are still one or two features we don't know about that two devs have called their 'favourite'. A bunch of Artifact information like what models or names for what specs, and specific talents and methods of progression. Will we go back to MoP style faction/daily/story progression? Will we keep WoD's Apexis style &quot;dailies&quot;? Will the new &quot;Followers&quot; join us in the world, or just unlock extra areas for us? What specs are being renamed? Are any more being altered as much as Survival? What might we see in content patches, assuming everything we've seen so far is for launch? Will the weekly events be revamped in any way? Tabard storage? How exactly will the new Transmog system work? How are the new Profession quests and progressions going to work?<br />
<br />
I think they were also going to show the full Legion cinematic, but don't quote me on that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Blizzard has zero say in when and where the trailer is released. It is all up to the studio. If Universal/Legendary Pictures tells them to release it at Blizzcon it is going to be released at Blizzcon.<br />
<br />
Although all he said was it would be released in November. Blizzcon is in November and it seems like the logical choice but his tweet doesn't say Blizzcon.</div></div><hr />
