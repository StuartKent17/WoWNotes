Another wave of hotfix has been deployed on live realms including a very interesting one ... Also, the Oculus has been nerfed once again!<br />
1/5/10<br />
<br />
The proc for the item, The Last Word, has been greatly increased to allow for more continuous uptime.<br />
The NPC Margrave Dhakar in Icecrown will properly respawn if killed while doing the quest, The Flesh Giant Champion.<br />
Wyvern Sting no longer triggers the extra shot effect from Zod's Repeating Longbow.<br />
The Oculus had some additional changes made. The Planar Anomlies during the Eregos encounter will have a shorter duration and do reduced damage, some of the drakes above Varosâ€™s platform have been removed, and the drakes controlled by players will move a little faster.<br />
Players can now send a whisper to a player from another realm that is currently in their party.<br />
The Invigoration buff from melee attacks using the Heartpierce dagger will now grant twice as much resources as before. It now grants 2 rage, 4 energy, or 120 mana every 2 seconds for 10 seconds.<br />

Lady Deathwhisper 25-man nerf<br />
I was going to reply but this summed things up pretty well. A lot of players killed Lady Deathwhisper, but a lot of people also struggled with it which wasn't the intent. These changes did not impact on the heroic version though changes may be made down the road on those as they start to see some action. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/22418972336-why-the-nerf-to-deathwhisperer.html))<br />

Heroism/Bloodlust Drums<br />
Shaman aren't a support class. They have some very nice buffs, but those aren't the same thing. The older design of the shaman was that you bring them in order to make the rest of the group really shine. That's not really where we see the class now. You should want one in your raid, but you should be okay if you don't have one. Put another way, we don't want to to make stacking one class too appealing, but we want you to have flexibility, especially in 10-player raids.<br />
<br />
We don't want anyone being brought to a raid just because they have a super special buff that the group considers mandatory. Some people consider Bloodlust mandatory and some don't. At the very least it is brought by all 3 trees of shaman, versus say something like the Scorch +crit debuff only really belonging to Fire mages (and there are multiple ways to get that one now too).<br />
<br />
Now it's also possible to homogenize buffs too much. If it's trivially easy to get everything you need then we might as well just cast a &quot;you're better&quot; aura on you anytime you're in a raid. Don't let the fact that we're moving away from the &quot;you have to have me&quot; model to mean the opposite extreme is where we want to end up.<br />
<br />
We're not sure we'll make Bloodlust drums for the reasons we stated above. But we're not worried about the concern that shaman will never get invited again. You shouldn't be getting invited because of your buff today. You should get invited because you're not annoying and because you contribute to progress.

I guess you're either one of the people who completely ignore when others need help with their class/spec/role, or start backtalking them rather than helping.<br />
<br />
A lot of people have been wishing for this feature to be added for a long time, seeing as when you try to wrtie advice to someone in party chat, there's usually some jerk who's going to pick up on that and start crying n00b and l2p. With whispers you can prevent that. Sure, some people might be too stubborn to listen, but at least you tried, and you're more likely to get ignored than the person leaving the group.</div></div><hr />

Completely wrong, I'm the guy who plays his char and let others do their job but helps if someone asks to.<br />
So I don't care if some party members do shit, I just keep playing. No reason to whisper anyone.</div></div><hr />

I don't like oculus.<br />
Poor design - vihicle fights...<br />
And yes - I've got all achievments done a lot of times pre nerf - played every role and instructed a lot of newbies what they should or should't do. Still that &quot;it's easy now&quot; changes in no way my opinion on the oculus -&gt; I don't like it!<br />

It would also be funny just because they would give such an iconic ability to pretty much any leatherworker. Talk about having no respect for their own property. <br />
Honestly it theirs and they can do with it what they choose but in the long run there is going to be a price to pay. Many iconic gamedevelopers and market leaders have fallen over the years and Blizzard is not immune. As long as corporate and the artistic people can keep eachother in line they should be fine though.</div></div><hr />

Lady Deathwhisper 25-man nerf<br />
I was going to reply but this summed things up pretty well. A lot of players killed Lady Deathwhisper, but a lot of people also struggled with it which wasn't the intent. These changes did not impact on the heroic version though changes may be made down the road on those as they start to see some action. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/22418972336-why-the-nerf-to-deathwhisperer.html))<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This just makes me go &quot;wtf?!?&quot; ... A boss in the endgame Tier10 raid content is not intended to have people struggle?! Why not just put a cache in that room with free epics and a sign reading &quot;CBA to get facerolled by morons unable to press three buttons in succession, come meet me in heroic if you want to make out. - Love, Lady D.&quot; <br />
Man we oneshotted that encounter in our first ever pug (after wiping 11 times on Marrowgar - yes, we really were that bad :P), holy cow.<br />
Y'know, ib4 &quot;we pay the same as y.. blabla&quot;: I have never been to a heroic raid in WoTLK as I don't have the time for 3-6 raid evenings per week, but I still want a challenge! If raiding normal modes boils down to facerolling everything then why have them in at all? So &quot;even casuals can see all content&quot;? Screw that. I want to not only see all the content, I want to feel it, too. This is effing Ice Crown Citadel, home of countless horrors capable of destroying all life on Azeroth if let loose. Way to go to &quot;see&quot; that part of the content (&quot;lore&quot;) when you breeze through it while brain-afking.<br />
<br />
TL;DR: Damn bads QQing about oh-so-hard raiding are ruining my gaming experience as a casual. Why not put up ilvl261 vendors in Dalaran if raiding is &quot;not intended to make you struggle&quot;?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yomiko</div><div class="date">2010-01-06, 09:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Honestly thinking about the recent nerfs to Occulus is that...maybe Occulus isn't hard but its so darn annoying to players that its worth to wait the 15 mintues + waiting in line again to reque for another dungeon then to have to go through that hassle. I did H-Occulus on my shadow priest one week after WoTLK hit and it was confusing, but we made it through. Although...this was with friends/family and not a PuG. I honestly stay in every Occulus random I get and I've never wiped or had bad players in that instance. HOWEVER, just the fact that I cannot play as MY character but a stupid drake is what really bothers me about that place. IF they ever nerfed it so that you fight ON your drake as your character instead then WOW that would make me just run Occulus. &quot;look at me! I'm a dwarf warrior riding on a drake slammin your face!&quot;.<br />
<br />
Thousands of people complained about this instance and instead of removing it from the random ques or all-together they nerfed it a bit to help people out. So all you guys complaining about it being nerfed are in the minority. It's a good change so don't worry about it...Occulus won't/hardly be entered anymore once Cataclysm hits anyways. <br />
--<br />
<br />
As for shamans...I'm really glad in WoTLK they nerfed a lot of their stuff (Bloodlust with the debuff) as I was always thrown out on my holy paladin in BT/Sunwell for a resto shaman for certain fights and I was really angry. It really unfair to bring a bunch of shamans just so you can constantly bloodlust, so that change was for the better. Though that doesn't mean nobody likes them anymore, my shaman is always welcomed in groups as she does good DPS, helpful totems and does offer BL if there isn't another shaman doing it. <br />
<br />
And about Lady Deathwhisper...this is normal mode guys, not heroic. Blizzard wants everyone to experience ICC/Lich King so stop being all elitist and save your complaining if they nerf heroic modes.</div></div><hr />

The Oculus had some additional changes made. The Planar Anomlies during the Eregos encounter will have a shorter duration and do reduced damage, some of the drakes above Varosâ€™s platform have been removed, and the drakes controlled by players will move a little faster.<br />

<br />
For real, a player that pays the same fee as everyone else, but can't do the &quot;hard&quot; mode should be threat as a scrub faceroller? No right to have a decent challenge in a game (that's why it's called a game)?<br />
<br />
Hard modes just became their excuses for everything. Unfortunatelly. So they don't have to talk about bad cattering decisions. And they don't know why ppl leave the game after a few weeks of new content and just come back months later on the next patch...<br />
<br />
And they're still nerfing oculus? They're attacking this &quot;leaving&quot; problem wrong. Should never reward bad behavior, punish it. Track players behavior while using dungeon finder. If that player leaves this certain dungeon over and over without even starting it, start increasing his dungeon finder CD until the point where he'll be off it for 1day or more... in fact or just remove his frost badges for the next dungeon after leaving oculus without trying. Done.<br />
<br />
Same thing for tanks that are farming hilts and don't warn people about it. Tired of finally getting a group and when we're about to pull the 1st boss in FoS/PoS/HoR, he just leaves. Track this behavior on said dungeons, remove him from dungeon finder (or even lock those 3 heroics for him, even better) for a while or even some days according to the number of H-Frozen Halls groups he left before 1st boss. Learn to respect the other 4 players with you.<br />
<br />
No problem with giving BL/Heroism with drums. They gave other &quot;iconic&quot; spells like Kings. And they cut other classes from their unique buffs with this &quot;bring the player, not the class&quot;, why Shammies still have their guaranted spot because of that? (not to mention other little buffs/convenient spells that still make ppl choose a baddie instead of a good player, but to a &quot;little&quot; lesser extent).</div></div><hr />

I think it's sad that being &quot;challenging&quot; has become a bad thing to many people. As soon as something requires some effort, loads of people start QQing that it's &quot;too hard&quot; and cry for nerfs. &quot;challenging&quot; =|= &quot;hard&quot;! Challenges are what make games fun for me, apparently the greater portion of the playerbase are only in it for easy purplez... and Blizz is catering to 'em. :(</div></div><hr />

Toke us about 20 trys, then he was dead too and it was a even better &quot;Yes!!&quot; Experience.<br />

In tbc era, they were unique, every specc shaman could boost his/her group, in vanilla they were even more unique. Now, its a piece of shit. That one gcd is maybe great for pvp, but totems are useless as long as you have other classes, so theres no point to even pull them out. I am always getting BoW, there is always an ele shammy and DK, so i am playing resto and i am not even using totems. And also, that dps isnt that good, its better to take one rogue with 10k instead of enha shammy with 6-7k.<br />

not saying a nerf was necessary but it was odd to me that in 10mans she had a 3mil mana shield.... but in 25mans it was like what? 14mil? <br />

so you go from having 10 people to 25... but the damage you need to do goes from 3 to 14 million.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DrgnDancer</div><div class="date">2010-01-06, 03:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, really. I have never, ever complained about a nerf, or acted like an elitist prick... but nerf Oculus? Again? Drake flight speed increase is reasonable, since it doesn't really affect fight mechanics, just speeds up transport, but everything else is just getting ridiculous. The place was never hard and is swiftly approaching being easier than most normal instances. I *hate* when people drop out when I get it for randoms (and I strongly support a longer &quot;deserter&quot; de-buff for people that leave parties in uncompleted instances), but at this point no one is going to drop Oculus who is not going to drop no matter what they do. Adding more and more rewards, while nerfing more and more of the instance is not going to help. At this point the only people dropping are the &quot;I hate Oculus, because it's Oculus&quot; crowd who aren't going to stay not matter what you do, and the people who heard this instance was hard sometime early last year and will never know about any nerfs or extra loot because they don't read forums. Or patch notes. Or maybe anything ever. <br />
<br />
Slightly off-topic I'm going to say that I *really* think that they should increase the time of the deserter de-buff for people that leave incomplete instances (heroic or regular). I realize why they did it like they did. Programatically it is easier to provide a group wide de-buff to every party member that fades in the time it takes to do the instance. It will be harder to check each party exit and determine whether it is early or not. It will lead to some unjust de-buffs where a party as whole decided to disband after realizing they could not complete something (maybe put it on some sort of timer where if the party was in the instance more then 30 minutes it is not applied). The benefits will be pretty substantial though. People will be less inclined to leave Oculus if they have to wait an hour after to requeue. They'll be less likely to abandon a party of &quot;noobs&quot; (which in the opinions of some people seems to include anyone who doesn't do at least 4K DPS average across a five man).<br />
<br />
People are assholes and asshole behavior needs to have some negative consequences. I was in a regular FoS the other day, trying to get the cloak that the Devourer of Souls drops (finally got it after 24 attempts). Now my rogue is pretty well geared. Other than my cloak, belt and Darkmoon: Greatness trinket, I'm in all 245 or better. The other two DPS were not bad either. Between us we were pulling around 10K average DPS across the instance, which is way more that adequate for FoS. The tank and healer were from the same server/guild, but no one thought anything of that. We cleared through the first boss with no wipes and no problems of any sort. Without warning the tank and healer just left. There's no possible way that we'd done anything to offend them, and we clearly didn't suck. They just wanted something off the first boss and couldn't be bothered to finish the instance once he was dead. I'm sure they requeued immediately to do it again, and screw over another group. Took us nearly ten minutes to get another tank and healer, and then only because I got a guildie to come help a brother out. There was probably less than 5 minutes minutes left in the instance. So irritating.</div></div><hr />

Are you seriously gonna have this discussion because shammies are the number 1 repeat number 1 needed spot to fill in any and all 10 mans and alot of 25s too. I mean seriously to replace sp totem we need to have demo lock with good gear resist totems need to have certain number of pallies. and to blizz thinking hero/BL isnt needed come on who really believes that? And dps isnt up to par bc most dont really know how to play and the ones that do usually heal. You guys are a versatile class and should be dpsing like one. Not far behind but not on par with pure dps. Now i say this never really playing a shammy( i didnt like the totem system) but as a lock i have to say Never Ever complain to me about your buffs. I have to go demo to have a buff hardly at all. No one hardly cares about candy and i usually SS myself bc no one else cares. O and btw shammies get there own soul stone basically. Fel int gets over ridden by like every priest and any warrior will override imp buff. Talk about useless buffs and i constantly hear that locks are OP well we are pure dps we should be towards top of meters but have you seen our t10 bonus its so not on par with other classes for instance i know a pally who got t10 2 pc and just spams seal/ DS in heroics and does like 8k dmg he tanked gundrak with 4 ppl in ret gear the other day and still was #1 with 7422 dps come on no more talk about OP classes and boo hoo i wont get a raid invite. My 25 man takes at best two locks and only because they are both in top 7 dps while they take 4-5 shammies. If anything give locks and rogues some type of buff i mean even just a little one in a spec we actually use ie destro/afflict</div></div><hr />

<br />
When I say the last boss gives you more emblems they laugh at me<br />
<br />
<br />
What can we do?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Nothing.<br />
<br />
Not everyone reads the forums or patch notes even. WE know, but to those people who just play and not pay attention to patch notes are probably not going to know until they see someone in dalaran with the drake. <br />
<br />
Player 1:&quot;Hwo did u get dat?&quot;<br />
Player 2:&quot;Oculus.&quot;<br />
Player 1:&quot;nobody told me!!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
I suppose the best course of action is to have blizzard literally mail everyone &quot;Hey, Oculus isn't that bad, we added so and so, so you can stop leaving!&quot;</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">serif</div><div class="date">2010-01-06, 04:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">really? i mean come on! shamans buffs suck, they can be replaced boo hoo. Are you seriously gonna have this discussion because shammies are the number 1 repeat number 1 needed spot to fill in any and all 10 mans and alot of 25s too. I mean seriously to replace sp totem we need to have demo lock with good gear resist totems need to have certain number of pallies. and to blizz thinking hero/BL isnt needed come on who really believes that? And dps isnt up to par bc most dont really know how to play and the ones that do usually heal. You guys are a versatile class and should be dpsing like one. Not far behind but not on par with pure dps. Now i say this never really playing a shammy( i didnt like the totem system) but as a lock i have to say Never Ever complain to me about your buffs. I have to go demo to have a buff hardly at all. No one hardly cares about candy and i usually SS myself bc no one else cares. O and btw shammies get there own soul stone basically. Fel int gets over ridden by like every priest and any warrior will override imp buff. Talk about useless buffs and i constantly hear that locks are OP well we are pure dps we should be towards top of meters but have you seen our t10 bonus its so not on par with other classes for instance i know a pally who got t10 2 pc and just spams seal/ DS in heroics and does like 8k dmg he tanked gundrak with 4 ppl in ret gear the other day and still was #1 with 7422 dps come on no more talk about OP classes and boo hoo i wont get a raid invite. My 25 man takes at best two locks and only because they are both in top 7 dps while they take 4-5 shammies. If anything give locks and rogues some type of buff i mean even just a little one in a spec we actually use ie destro/afflict<br />
<br />
<br />
so let me see if i follow this. you're saying shamans should lose their unique buffs, and the pure dps classes should get EVEN MORE dps? so shamans should be gimped to hell and locks/rogues should widen the margin between themselves and #2-#3 on the meters? locks/rogues are already at the top.<br />
<br />
if you take away shamans' uniqueness then you're going to have to buff SHAMANS' dps, not the pure dps classes. if you make shamans another pure dps class (by taking away their utility) then you better be prepared to see them beating you on recount because that's the kind of dps buff it would take to maintain the 'bring the player not the class' quota.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Most heroics I do now, I wear my dps gear while in 5/5/5 blood spec, it's useful to be able to whisper the healer directly to ask if this is okay, instead of saying it in party chat.<br />

<br />
<br />
You just explained where there is a reward, which seems to be the one you're looking for, for hard modes: &quot;earning&quot; the &quot;right&quot; to your victory. If you want to &quot;earn&quot; your right to see the bosses go down, play in hard modes, and done. There, you get your epic Arthas death or whatever. <br />
<br />
Your opinion is not universal. Some actually enjoy current raiding, and will think the Arthas death is epic even in normal mode. <br />
<br />
The nice thing about the way they're doing it right now is that people doing it in normal, or 'easy' mode, doesn't stop you from doing it in hard mode. Really it seems the only valid complaint is that either the tuning on hard mode is too hard, or maybe there's no 'medium mode' (not to give blizzard ideas). &quot;BAWW other people can do this on an easier difficulty setting!&quot; is just bawwing.</div></div><hr />

And one more thing that happened to us in CoS today - drakes in second phase of the instance (time wardens or whatever) didnt attack nearby party members, but they attacked Arthas first everytime, being unattackable for that time.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">newhorizon</div><div class="date">2010-01-06, 05:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was thinking about the heroism thing and I think that it might end up being a good thing for shammies in the long run to have that buff as a drum, There could be a little bit of short term pain where they might end up not getting invited but it would also give you a very strong leg to stand on in getting Blizz to buff your specs which is the real core reason that you wouldn't be invited to the raids in the first place. <br />
<br />
I mean if it was me I think I would rather be a decent dps and have myself/drums ( or whatever mechanism they choose to release it in) be able to cast heroism ( and possibly have the heroism be a bit of a nerfed version of what the shammies themselves can actually offer 8% vs 10% kings)<br />
<br />
I personally play a rogue and am happy with my dps but if I had the option of doing 8000 dps with a class unique buff or 10000 dps with a boe buff that is pretty powerful I would take the 10k every day of the week.</div></div><hr />

Don't have a shaman in 10-mans? fine if you can't do 10-mans it's cause your not geared not because you don't have Bl/Hero. <br />

yes the intent was to give free loot to all lame fucktards. this fight was sooo nice but no they have to nerf it as everything else so it can be done in lvl1 starting shit :-\</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Canopus</div><div class="date">2010-01-06, 05:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think that Blizzard has gotten a little too nerf bat happy with the game as of late. Occulus is a perfect and recent example of this.<br />
<br />
I can understand the arguement behind them adding the loot bag to the final reward loot at the end of Occulus. The logic is sound. People who queue up for random Heroics tend to cringe when they see the loading screen for Occulus. Those same people tend to also drop group immediately when they enter Occulus. The added loot bag at the end is an attempt to cut down on those cowards who bail out on Occulus groups. Whether it will work or not is yet to be seen. I know it may make an immediate impact for those badge whores, jewelcrafters, mount collectors, or anyone who see the real value of the loot bag. But, the general thought may still remain. Noone apparently likes doing Occulus. As crazy as it may sound, you may even see Blizzard add the &quot;Battered Hilt&quot; into those loot bags to really attract players to play Occulus. Well, not really. LOL<br />
<br />
The point is not only has Blizzard swung the nerf bat to Occulus, but also to reg/Heroic Pit of Saron, and reg/Heroic Halls of Reflection, and some changes to the Icecrown Citadel bosses. My question is when will this madness end? Is Blizzard catering too much to the masses? <br />
<br />
Personally, I hope they will stop swinging the nerf bat so much. I can understand fixing or make small adjustments that they may or may not have had time to fix during the PTR. But, killing the difficulty, the original difficulty, of a raid or instance just so they can to cater to the masses is getting ridiculous.</div></div><hr />

Having defeated Putricide in 10 man last night on our last attempt (25 was put off for tomorrow due to lag) I am almost positive that no pug that you cobble together from trade chat will ever down it within the number of attempts provided. And considering how so many pugs are apparently already failing at Stink/Precious I'm no longer concerned with the difficulty of the first four bosses. Have them, knock yourselves out, enjoy the view from Saurfang's terrace ;)<br />
<br />
<br />
I will, most likely, eat my own words within three weeks when the next wing is opened up and they nerf this one by removing the puppies, and making Putricide no long spawn green or yellow slimes because &quot;a lot of people also struggled with it which wasn't the intent&quot; ::)</div></div><hr />

It took nearly 10 minutes just to &quot;get started&quot; because the healer and 3rd DPS kept dropping instantly. We went through 8 players until people finally stayed. The extra loot just isn't enough draw to people given that a lot are in it just for frosts and probably are swimming in Triumphs (I'm up to 110 now after buying all the heirloom items. Yes I mean all of them). <br />
<br />
Take out the drake mount, the gems, the triumphs and just add an extra frost emblem and I bet a lot more people will stay.<br />
<br />
The instance is probably one of the easier and faster ones you can get now but it has such a bad reputation. After we finally got a stable group we cleared it in 8 minutes.<br />

6. Chain Heal..... Hate to say it -.-.....<br />
<br />
Yeah they may not be needed in all fights, but lets be real no one else has most of them. I have been playing Shaman since Vanilla and I personally don't think we are loosing TOO much... Unless you suck and the only way you could ever see a raid zone is using your BL. <br />

<br />
The orbs are also a pain if people don't know what to do. Generally i just have the group fly between the small platforms. But once, the tank decided to not follow us, sat there and ate all the orbs, died, then called me an idiot for not healing and left. Personally, i think every instance should pop up a damn strategy guide. <br />
<br />
And I think it should be the bloodlust/heroism flag, made by tailoring. Plant it in the ground, and everyone within a 50 yd radius gets a 25% haste buff. it would give me a use for all the frostweave cloth i pick up in heroics. LW's already have kings and MotW, and scribes have fort. Tailors only have their super handy frostweave nets...</div></div><hr />

Also, if any shamans are worried about a raid spot because of bloodlust/heroism, you may wish to try and get better, and stop being carried over one buff.<br />
Shamans are in NO where near enough of a bad place as some of you are making them out to be, if you are doing bad for your gear level, maybe its not the class thats the problem, maybe its you.</div></div><hr />

No. You missed the point. We already killed the boss, seen the death scene, heard the RP so nothing is new after the hardmode kill.

As far as heroism drums, i'm stil holding out for the fact that blizzard is going to give paladins Herolust in the next patch expansion which will buff the raid with 30% more haste at all times and will be an aura that will stack with other paladins in the group using the same aura.</div></div><hr />
