<br />
IMO - until top guilds start live streaming their progress live Method do, their world firsts will always be slightly diminished.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">noladrew</div><div class="date">2019-05-03, 04:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Apparently they kept the entire raid stacked to deal with the relic debuff. Supposedly there's a very brief window where the debuff wont trigger any damage but can still be removed in that window if the proper relics are stacked as well. Not to take away from what they've done, but imo more &quot;cheesy&quot; than resetting shaman ankh. Perhaps also why they favored ele shaman more than lock as well... &quot;fk it, people are gonna die, might as well bring more people that can revive&quot; Props to them for figuring it out either way and getting the kill.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ah, perhaps it should be more of a concern before it becomes yet another thing to look down upon in their pastime. It could just as easily give sense and joy to them and their world instead of serving as confirmation of their oppositional views discriminating where there's no need only perceived self-serving interest.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I read on wowhead yesterday, people use shamans for crown, they die and use ankh, and ankh doesnt count towards all battle resses, Method used that tactic to let more bresses be available.<br />
<br />
No idea if Pieces followed that tactic from the beginning, but anyway gz to them! :)</div></div><hr />

We made full circle back to Sunwell, shamans and warlocks, who would have thought. <br />

WTB one raid where you actually stack melee for a change, kinda getting tired of all the &quot;bench the melee&quot; fights.</div></div><hr />

World of warcraft raiding competitive scene is pretty small compared to the likes of league of legends or counter strike or even overwatch. They enjoy being the best but I'm pretty sure they would rather earn money than kill a boss in a non-tier raid. They are saving their strength for Azshara.</div></div><hr />

Obviously he meant in the mainstream sense. And he’s right. Making money is more important than winning a race in fucking world of Warcraft. Especially in 2019 WoW when there’s never been less competition.<br />
<br />
It’s cool that another guild took the first kill for once though. Hope it keeps happening to spice it up.<br />

missing a 4th healer from that roster (only 3, resto shaman, disc priest and holy pala), so probably an alt or a player not in their guild played the 4th healer</div></div><hr />

Method's setup was even more lol. 7 afflilocks, 0 melee.<br />

Method had more warlocks than unique classes.</div></div><hr />

Trust me if they had a choice, they would put Sco on a permanent vacation.</div></div><hr />

But they did have Fragnance on his DH. I watched his stream not long before they killed boss. Wowprogress list is missing few players.<br />
<br />
Method's setup was even more lol. 7 afflilocks, 0 melee.<br />
They also had 16 players, right? Look at raid frames in kill clips, not incomplete wowprogress list.<br />
<br />
See https://www.twitch.tv/videos/419776869?tt_content=full_vod_button&amp;tt_medium=clips_watch_page&amp;t=3h17m58s or https://www.twitch.tv/videos/419778975?tt_content=full_vod_button&amp;tt_medium=clips_watch_page&amp;t=3h11m30s<br />
<br />
So its actually 10 locks, 1 melee :)</div></div><hr />

Oh you are right, they had only 16 on that screenshot.<br />

<br />
A: that would be the risk Method took by live streaming their mythic raids.<br />
<br />
B: even if all Pieces did was copy Methods strategy that would mean mechanically they are the better guild because they were able to take Methods strategy and execute it better/faster.<br />
<br />
I cant image having my identity so wrapped in being a fan of WOW guild that I would feel the need to down play the achievements of a different guild.</div></div><hr />

Yes, but it counts as melee. On progression they also had rogue.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Azshira</div><div class="date">2019-05-04, 10:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think this boss is officially the hardest to kill in-game so far (if only looking at pull count) taking over 700+ pulls. Can't remember any other boss coming close? Maybe KJ in Legion. I know KJ had more bugs and needed big nerf reworks to be killable, whereas this boss seemed to be working, yet needed some tweaking to be more forgivable (not sure if killable before these or not).<br />
<br />
I remember having a quick look at Method's stream yesterday when they got him to 2% early in the day, and I thought well that's it congrats Method again. Logged in hours later and still fighting... It was honestly a refreshing surprise seeing Pieces get it when I checked today. Congrats to both guilds and to all those fighting on.</div></div><hr />

While the guilds that do/did it on mythic supposedly have/had fun - I guess because they simply don't care what class they play - I personally think the design of such encounters is quite awfull. These random flagged hostile moments greatly punish classes that have indiscriminate cleaves or the ones that would inadvertedly become the victims of that cleave, and in this case add another reason to make abandoning certain player roles viable; here almost all melee. I just hope this mechanic won't become a main-stay in the raidboss toolkit, like soaks have become these days.</div></div><hr />

because they didnt spend a week of 12 hour raid days trying to kill it.</div></div><hr />

There's no way regular guilds have any hope of killing it as it is before the next tier comes out. These world first race guilds, with fully decked-out Mythic gear from BoD, took this long to kill it. There's only one other boss in this raid, so it's not like it's something you can build up gear in effectively. It's the same tier as BoD, so it's not like there's some other source of gear to help you kill it. I don't have a problem with content being hard, and wouldn't care if they leave it as it is. But this is something that next to no one in the playerbase will get to see if they keep it as is - hardly anyone will care once the next tier is out. And that is anathema to their design philosophy these days.</div></div><hr />

Probably two weeks, so other hardcore guilds would have a chance to kill it pre-nerf. I'm sure many of them are getting close to kill, just need a bit more time and luck.</div></div><hr />
