Build 8820 - Additional Dungeon Loot<br />
A few more items were added to the dungeon loot list (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=13959.0). <br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Lake Wintergrasp Upcoming Changes<br />
We’re hoping to get the zone into better shape in the next couple patches. Here’s a few things that should be coming in the next build:<br />
<br />
• All vehicles should be despawn after the battle ends<br />
• Demolisher and Siege Vehicle health has been reduced by 50-75%<br />
• Demolisher and Siege Vehicle ram attacks no longer knock a player high enough to kill them<br />
• Jet &amp; Bomber health has been reduced<br />
• Bomber damage has been increased<br />
• Players in Bombers should no longer take damage<br />
• Reward for holding the keep has been added<br />
• The Goblin Workshops in the North and South now also supply players with land mines that deal bonus damage to tanks<br />
<br />
We also hope to have a system for rewarding only players that participated in the battle working soon. <br />
<br />

Profession recipes collection achievements<br />
We're working on the ability to do these kind of achievements. We wouldn't do anything percentage based but rather choose a flat number and add more achievements as we add more content.<br />
<br />
Most likely, you'll see a cooking version like this in the near future. Versions for the primary professions won't go live until account-based achievements are active. We don't want to encourage people picking up and dropping profressions simply to gain achievements. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/20/9244877181-profession-recipe-collection.html))<br />

Feats of Strength - Spirit of Competition 2008<br />
Great idea. We implemented two Feats... one for the Tabard and one for the Pet. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/20/9336453693-suggestion-spirit-of-competition-08-feat.html))<br />

Anticipation / Shamanistic Focus changes / Windfury concerns<br />
One change we're doing to Anticipation is changing it to 3-points, and giving it disarm reduction. We are also most likely going to change Shamanistic Focus to make it a flat mana reduction in shock cooldowns. It's too spammy right now, and the class has too many on proc buffs. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/8/8765613341-malans-enhancementapalooza-8770.html))<br />
<br />
Edit: BTW, one thing I totally agree with is the Windfury Weapon concern. We'll see if we can make the ability less complicated/&quot;mathy&quot;. <br />

We'll be doing some considerable work on Warlocks before that patch hits. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/9/9237587159-content-patchnot-good.html))<br />

BlizzCast Episode 5: Special WWI Edition<br />
Nothing really related to the game itself in this Blizzcast, but still a nice read if you're interested in what happened during the Worldwide Invitational. <br />
This special Worldwide Invitational wrap-up edition of BlizzCast begins with a brief chat between RTS Community Manager Karune, World of Warcraft Community Manager Nethaera, and Diablo III Community Manager Bashiok about their WWI experiences. Bashiok then takes you into the mind of Diablo III Lead Designer Jay Wilson, and the two discuss some recent hot issues surrounding the game. Listen to the show now or check out the transcript to see all the featured artwork.<br />

They said early in TBC that they were working on a solution for when you died up in the air and your corpse was unreachable from the ground. And now, almost 2 years later they have a solution for this &gt;_&gt;</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, it's called rez sickness. I remember the first time I died on top of a mushroom in zangar marsh. I learned not to go flying so close to the alliance base after that.<br />
<br />
Since Wintergrasp is supposed to be an active PvP zone, you can't really have people gimped for 10 mins just because they died in a bad spot though, so this change is necessary here, and not quite so much elsewhere.</div></div><hr />

true, the mount on which you fly from northwestern tower to east tower, is also a spectral Gryphon..<br />

You haven't realized by now that Warriors — against all visible evidence and in contradiction of any logic — are 100% convinced that they suck in PvP? I don't pretend to understand why they have this widespread delusion, so I can't tell you the reasons. I just observe that this is the case.</div></div><hr />

To have an answer to this question, you must look at the psychological profile of the average in the warrior demographic.<br />
<br />
You'll find this as a common denominator among other things:<br />
<br />
Self-Entitlement<br />
Delusion de Grandeur<br />
Obsessive/Compulsive Behavior<br />
<br />
When put in a situation where they just can't have absolute control, they go insane. True story.<br />

Also, isn't most of Northrend one big graveyard? lol... you should just be able to respawn not too far away in that case! Either that, or have the Angel that offers to rez you carry you somewhere... why the griffin? Does the Horde ride a Griffon as well?</div></div><hr />

What happens when the nerfbat hits something like, let's say, Warlocks?<br />
<br />
A little QQ in forums is enough to have everything back to &quot;normal&quot;, lol. They crash forums, lol.<br />
<br />
Guess wich class if the one that complains about Warriors beeing overpowered and in need of nerfbats every patch? Locks, lol. And only 'cause it's probably the class that gives them some problems to win if played right (instead of another normal easy win for locks).</div></div><hr />

<br />
So &#8364;3 equals $3 in Blizzard's conversion rates? Hell, anybody else thinking that's a ripoff?<br />
<br />
Currently it's &#8364;1 = $1.4684 -&gt; exchange rates (http://www.x-rates.com/d/USD/EUR/graph120.html)<br />
<br />
So you'd get roughly something like $3 = &#8364;2,043<br />
<br />
So it's nearly 150% of the price you'd pay as an US american? For something, which doesn't even involve s&amp;h costs or whatever?</div></div><hr />

Who brought up Warlocks?! This is a good example of the kind of delusional thinking I was talking about. What logical leap brought Warlocks into the discussion? As for myself, Warlock is the only class I have never played at all. I have four 70s: Hunter, Paladin, Priest, and Shaman. My Warrior is level 48, by the way.<br />
<br />
The objective reality is that Warriors are a dominant force in PvP, not as annoying as Rogues perhaps but every bit as deadly. If you continue to behave as though that were not the case, you'll continue to look irrational to the rest of us.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
the fact that windfury weapon pretty much requires a specific speed main hand and a suitable offhand so that offhand doesnt steal WF procs.<br />
<br />
throw haste into the equation for weapon speeds and you get yoruself an overly complicated math equation.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Warriors are not nearly as powerful until you put them into a team with a healer glued to their ass. That's the basic problem - warriors aren't broken (OP) so much as the whole team based PvP dynamic in WoW is. A class can be easy to kill when you run across them out in the world, but throw them into a team with support classes, and they become dominant.<br />
<br />
Not entirely sure what you do about that.</div></div><hr />

Warriors in 1v1 are not bad either. What class gives warriors a run for their money? I'd say mages (frost) and there's a heapload of people arguing in another thread that frost warrior vs mage is a 50-50 - Most of which I assure you are warriors.<br />
<br />
They just flop their opinions like nuts depending on whether it is convenient to whine or to bang their chest.</div></div><hr />

Hunters are quite effective against warriors 1v1.</div></div><hr />

feral druid. although I would say dominates, rather than &quot;gives a run for their money&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
throw haste into the equation for weapon speeds and you get yoruself an overly complicated math equation.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Any word from blizz about enh shaman's using 2H weapons? Have any of the beta testers found 2Hs are better than the 2.6 WF typical setup that enh shamans are locked into. <br />
<br />
Really sucks having WF gimped to just 1 style of weapons. <br />

Yep.. he's only concerned with his own class being as EZ mode as possible. Doesn't matter if the game is balanced in any way/shape/form.</div></div><hr />

Except for Ret Pallies. And the DK situation will change, don't worry. They're not going to be as powerful, and people will learn to fight them more effectively.</div></div><hr />

What significant accomplishments-- like putting mortal strike on his action bar? Making friends with a healer?</div></div><hr />

Well if playing a warrior is that easy, getting 2k+ in arena should be no problem. When you get there you'll qualify to have your opinion count for anything.</div></div><hr />

I think the &quot;you can't say anything about warriors until you played one&quot; attitude falls under one of the 3 character traits commonly found in people who play warriors that he listed before:<br />
<br />
<br />
Self-Entitlement<br />
Delusion de Grandeur<br />
Obsessive/Compulsive Behavior<br />
<br />
And thus proving his thesis accurate.</div></div><hr />

My 5s in S3 hovered around 2100 most of the season... but I'm bored of TBC and have been barelly playing or caring for S4, why else would I be playing with a paladin &gt;_&lt; So you haven't proved shit, and until you post on a 2k+ warrior your opinion on warrior PVP means nothing.</div></div><hr />
