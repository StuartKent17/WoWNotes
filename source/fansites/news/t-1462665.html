Blizzard organized a couple of press tours in Europe and Korea and interesting info about the new expansion is starting to appear on the web.<br />
<br />
Mamytwink.com (http://www.mamytwink.com/) got to play the expansion for 5 hours and gave his impressions (http://www.mamytwink.com/actualite/press-tour-resume-de-5-heures-de-jeu-sur-warlords) along with a couple interesting spoilers. Below is a rough translation of original article (http://www.mamytwink.com/actualite/press-tour-resume-de-5-heures-de-jeu-sur-warlords): <br />
<br />
Leveling and Other Numbers<br />
<br />
I played a gnome warrior in the Shadowmoon Valley, the Alliance starting zone. After about 5 hours of /played and 80 quests I reached the end of the zone and Level 92.<br />
At level 91, I had 63k health as a Tank.<br />
Monsters had around 100k health.<br />
I was dealing around 1k to 5k damage on normal hits. Up to 10k critical damage for some abilities (Shield Slam).<br />
It takes 597k XP to go from level 90 to level 91 and 640k xp to go from level 91 to 92.<br />
Quests rewards were between 10k and 15k xp. Up to 20k for the difficult ones. <br />
A new quest type is available: the &quot;Bonus Objectives&quot;. When you walk around a zone, new objectives might appear randomly in your quest list. Completing the objectives will reward you with extra experience, leaving the area will drop the quest. <br />
<br />
<br />
Shadowmoon Valley<br />
<br />
Shadowmoon Valley is composed of lush green plains lit by the moonlight. It has a very peaceful feeling. The glades and forests are amazing and very colorful. You will find Naarus, Draeneis cities, and Iron Horde strongholds in the zone. <br />
The Alliance starting zone seems pretty much finished. Lots of details, impressive vegetation, and a lot of different monsters.<br />
I found a lot of monsters from The Burning Crusade that have been updated: Talbuks, Nether rays, Turtles, Larvas, Boars, Sporebats, Wolves, Bees. The new Talbuks and Sporebats models are EPIC.<br />
Ner'zhul is the principal antagonist of the zone.<br />
The zone ends with a scenario that I couldn't test because it wasn't available. It was called &quot;Grommar's Purge&quot; (Note: roughly translated)<br />
I found the zone really well made. The vast plains and colorful glades immerse you entirely in the game. The scenery is new and doesn't give you a feeling of deja vu (except for some monsters, but it's not really shocking). <br />
<br />
<br />
Misc<br />
<br />
The new race models are great (I could also create a female dwarf). The facial expressions are awesome!<br />
The new soundtrack is also very good.<br />
When asked about the beta, Ion Hazzikostas answered : SoonTM.<br />
<br />
<br />
SPOILER The zone ends with a pretty huge storyline twist, only click the line below if you do not care about spoilers. You should probably stay away from the comments of this news as well.<br />
<br />
Ner'zhul uses an evil force, the Void Terror. At the end of the zone, you fight Ner'zhul and he manages to corrupt a Naaru into a &quot;Dark Naaru&quot;. To purify the Naaru, Velen sacrifices himself and dies. This is a pretty huge plot twist and his death will be part of a cinematic at the end of the quest. It is followed by a giant battle. You join Maraad (freed from Ner'zhul earlier) to fight the Iron Horde. <br />
<br />

Warlords of Draenor Gameplay Footage<br />
Inven (http://www.inven.co.kr/webzine/) (Korean website) posted 3 videos of actual Warlords of Draenor footage on their Youtube channel. You can see a couple new things in these videos, including:<br />
<br />
<br />
The grass now moves as your character walks through it<br />
There is a toggle for new character models (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2014/february/newCharModelsToggle.jpg).<br />
The map now has navigation breadcrumbs at the top<br />

<br />
to be fair that one sets up two characters who have a chance to be very very important to the alliance and it doesn't actually remove the character in question due to it being the alternate version.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Cairne Bloodhoof =/= The Prophet Velen. And when did I imply that the Horde had anything to do with it. The point is, one of the Alliance leaders that has one of the biggest contributions to the overall lore of the game and some of the most innately powerful abilities (who was also largely left out of the actual game to many peoples' consternation) is killed in the first questing zone. Meanwhile, Alliance players have to have 2 expansions of World of Hordecraft. We can't even kill Garrosh when we defeat him, yet they take Velen out in a questing zone. Dumb as fuck.</div></div><hr />

This is a crock of shit and I'm tired of hearing people say this.<br />
<br />
It doesn't matter that its the alternate version. The fact is that this Velen and his actions in WoD were very clearly shown to us under the assumption it was in place of our Velen and the issue of &quot;He doesn't do anything.&quot; That's why they kept mentioning he was going to have a more active role, ect.<br />
<br />
And then they decide to kill him off in the first zone.<br />
<br />
such active. much alliance.</div></div><hr />

I could see something like this happening, would be nice for our Velen to actually do something once in a while.<br />

Agreed, I would be very very disappointed if THIS is what they had in mind with a more active role, but I hope it's just a way for them to exclude the double Velen problem and let our Velen get active.</div></div><hr />

The horde zone is good too but SMV is seriously looking good. It's amazing what new character models are doing for this game. It's such a breath of fresh air. If anything just having all of the NPC's with the updated models is a huge difference from live. Everything has more polygons and the game is actually starting to look a lot more fluid and modern.<br />

I hope this is the case. Either way, still dumb to take down one of the most powerful entities of Azeroth/Draenor in a questing zone. They could have done this more elegantly than just offing him in a questing cinematic.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I love how at the first mention of Velen's demise everyone assumes that that is the finality of his part in the coming story.<br />
<br />
If it happens that soon into the Xpac, and he's such a big lore piece (though fairly absent in the games thus far), I would imagine that Blizzard would remedy that later into the story ... Not to mention that this is all on Draenor. The last refuge of the Draenei. I can't imagine they'd just shove Velen under the rug like that unless they're planning something ridiculous and huge for the Draenei ...</div></div><hr />

An amazingly powerful being, Velen-Beta, died saving an even more powerful being, a naruu, from an orc supervillain. There are better ways to die than that?<br />
<br />
It's better he dies early in an impressive way. It makes a big impression on the maximum number of players. They will scatter once they leave the starting zone, but Velen-beta's death will stick with them. Can you even leave the starting zone without seeing his death? This isn't exactly a calm introduction like in MoP.<br />
<br />
Besides, now the new characters can take over and have the maximum amount of screen time and allow the story to progress without the constant drag of two Velens on the story.</div></div><hr />

Uh oh. Someone called that. Said that happened with the Pandaren as well. I never noticed that on Pandaren but it might be more noticable on other races.

If by public beta you mean open beta, then its a possibility, but closed beta will most definitely occur if not only for stress testing the game and testing each and every small aspect under a much wider array of possible users.</div></div><hr />

Sorry, but no. Having a closed beta keeps people playing more than testing internally and then releasing open beta.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is an amusing post, mainly because it was more than obvious that the people playing knew the basics of how to play their chosen classes, indicating that they've played before. So, keeping your post in mind, please tell me the difference level 90 boost is going to make..?<br />
<br />
New players that boost will still have 10 levels of current content to play through. They will either learn quickly or they'll have an extremely painful leveling experience, and an even worse dungeoning experience. It's not like the lower end of the skill level is sudden going to become worse due to 90 boosts because there are already players who have leveled to 90 and still have no idea what the hell is going on. Why? Because leveling does nothing to help you learn your class. <br />
<br />
<br />
End of Wotlk you had 33-34K HP<br />
<br />
Not entirely true, if you were DPS or Heals you had that much. Raiding with my Paladin in 10 man ICC I managed to get to 60k HP without Hellscream's Warsong (ICC buff).</div></div><hr />

At the end of ICC, my DK tank had 50k hp and that is with stam in every gem slot, etc, since stam stacking was the way to go back then. Once the cata pre-release patch came out, I had 70k hp without changing anything because of the buffs or whatever you wanna call them. If they weren't talking about tanks, though, DPS classes did have between 30-35k hp at the very end of WotLK (cata pre-patch era).</div></div><hr />

From the classic WoW manual:<br />
<br />
<br />
The elder shaman of the Frostwolf clan, Drek'Thar served as Thrall's tutor many years ago. Blind since birth, Drek'Thar had to prove his worth during the Horde's dark period.<br />

<br />
<br />
My exact thought. I demand that they start killing off 90 % of the memorable horde characters as well. This is just silly. I demand the death of Green Jesus and no more new testament expansionpacks aka World of Hordecraft. This is retarded. What do Alliance get for expansions? Neutral Khadgar, Neutral Tirion, you name it. I hate the storyline of this game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1) Velen did nothing important since his speech in Sunwell. Cairne Bloodhoof already had solid exposure BEFORE even WoW began.<br />
2) Nerh'zul is not part of player horde but part of the bad horde &quot;Iron Horde&quot; totally different. <br />
<br />
Sorry but the guy has a point. Horde favoritism is the issue here.<br />
<br />
It makes me wonder which Velen died<br />
<br />
The one native to the alternative timeline Outland we are visiting?<br />
or the one from the Alliance in our time?<br />
<br />
If the first died than its not a problem since our Velen can come in his place. He wont disapear either because the Outland Velen comes from a seperate timeline.<br />
If the second died than its also not a problem because Outland Velen can do the same.<br />
<br />
So yeah... my question is this: WHICH Velen died?</div></div><hr />

Correct, but they want to please everyone again, so they are doing squish every expansion instead (and might end up pleasing no one).<br />

That option was the first thing they did. Not everyone has cpu that can handle wow at max gfx as it is, so there is no point in adding more for them, plus it might take away some nostalgia from returning players. Also the pros (and the cool kids) will use them for extra performance anyway, as they are too busy playing the game to watch their models.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't believe the intention was for this person to record it and upload it. I think this was more of a leak of sorts so they didn't specifically choose someone to record it.<br />
<br />
Cavemen might be mongoloids, but they don't have low res textures, so those aren't really interchangeable thought processes.<br />
<br />
Also they aren't making orcs, or any race for that matter more evolved, they are just making them look more like what they originally envisioned that was impossible with previous tech. <br />
<br />
They haven't evolved in this time anyways, its been like 50 years or something like that, think about it, Garrosh's father is there. They aren't going back into prehistory. So no, they wouldn't have looked like that, but they WOULD stick out like a sore thumb and ruin any semblance of immersion if they were the only remaining low texture model in the game.<br />
<br />
PS - It is an alternate timeline anyways so current azeroth happenings would have no affect on WoD world, and vice versa.<br />

<br />
Neanderthals, the classic archetype of cave men, lived over one hundred thousand years ago, creatures do not evolve over the course of a few hundred years in extreme manners except in a few cases in WoW and those always involve an outside force like Fel Magic. Some people in WoW can live long, but regular Orcs do not live that long and the Draenei faction has not even existed that long. Draenei as a people may have, but if that is the case they would look more like the Eredar people rather than primitive creatures. Orcs would theoretically be smaller in fact since the drinking of Demon Blood made them larger and more physically intimidating. So Draenor Orcs would technically be smaller, but that's a level of detail I don't mind them skipping on since it might hurt the overall feel.</div></div><hr />

So, keeping your post in mind, please tell me the difference level 90 boost is going to make..?<br />
<br />
New players that boost will still have 10 levels of current content to play through. They will either learn quickly or they'll have an extremely painful leveling experience, and an even worse dungeoning experience. It's not like the lower end of the skill level is sudden going to become worse due to 90 boosts because there are already players who have leveled to 90 and still have no idea what the hell is going on. Why? Because leveling does nothing to help you learn your class. <br />

Not entirely true, if you were DPS or Heals you had that much. Raiding with my Paladin in 10 man ICC I managed to get to 60k HP without Hellscream's Warsong (ICC buff).<br />

Dear god... people like you need to quit playing.<br />

Sure, there is a chance that &quot;avoiding the free customization shitstorm&quot; came up during talks about the toggle button, but they were talking about letting people see the old graphics/models if they wanted to, since people were so attached to their toons.<br />

Hey Blizz, why no free customizations? We feel like the new models are so well done that you wont even want to re-customize, so it's not needed.<br />

<br />
Problem solved, for those who might prefer the old ones!<br />
<br />
I'm impressed Blizzard actually did something players wanted. Thumbs up!<br />
<br />
Okay, but ask yourself this. With the implementation of this toggle, does it make either of the following true?<br />
<br />
* They cannot add new hair/race options without including both old and new so as to not alienate players with old models.<br />
* They cannot add sub-races because they would have to make them as both old and new models.<br />
<br />
I'm all for some leeway in decisions on behalf of customers; I just don't want it to hamper any new additions because they're trying to placate those who prefer outdated models.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not from what I've seen. The way they're setting this up SEEMS to be as a pair of alternate realities, so much like DC Comics, you'll have Azeroth 1 as the core game and Azeroth/Draenor 2 as the WoD realms. Thus if Azeroth 1 Saurfang comes to Draenor 2, you might have two Saurfangs working together, etc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Blizzard has said that WOD Draenor is set in an alternate timeline that connects to ours, so events that happen there don't directly affect Azeroth's past (like... lets say we kill Ner'zhul, we won't suddenly not have a Lich King, no purge, WC3 pretty much never happens, blah blah).<br />
<br />
The WOD Draenor Dark Portal that's 20ish years ago is connected to ours, however, so Garrosh and the Iron Horde can come through and try to wtfpwn us<br />
<br />
Also, I don't feel this spoilers, since this is how Blizzard explained it at Blizzcon</div></div><hr />

How on earth did you read this as milking players for money?<br />
If they were milking players for money they WOULDN'T have added the toggle, because then anyone who doesn't like the new models would have to buy a re-customization. Instead they saw that not everyone liked the minor changes and gave players the option to use the old models if they don't like the new ones.<br />

No, I can actually see his point, and it's a valid one. What the toggle option of &quot;likes/dislikes&quot; is missing is &quot;Likes the new model, but doesn't like the particular face that the upgrade has assigned to them&quot;.

God I hope they remove that. The last thing I want to see in this new graphics style is 10 year old models running around on people who are incapable of dealing with change.<br />
<br />
That's not how video games work. Just because I don't have new models turned on, doesn't mean you will see my character as an old model. Each person's PC draws their own models, me toggling the model type doesn't change anything for you.</div></div><hr />

It's amazing to me that people react this way. Do you not understand how storytelling works? Velen leaves a gap of leadership (even if its just alternate Velen) that must be filled. That leaves people like Yrel to step up and take charge. This is the best thing to happen to their race lorewise since TBC launched.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tolvo</div><div class="date">2014-02-21, 03:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I believe a big part of the issue is just not the death of the character, but what the character has done leading up to their death. Velen as a character has had little impact in the game world despite being one of the most important characters in the lore period. He shows up very few times and rarely takes action instead focusing more so on talking. Velen is a prophet and a powerful priest, yet he does very little with that. His death would be a great way to introduce a new character and put the focus on them, but that would be good for said new character not Velen's story. So far in WoW he has just not been involved enough, then for this character to be killed off in such a way when there is finally an expansion they can have a big impact in is just wasteful on Blizzard's part. It is essentially saying &quot;Look, we want a redo. We set up this character and didn't know what to do with him, so let's just kill him and bring in somebody else that we think we can write for.&quot; If Velen had just done more from BC onward his death would be very meaningful, and we'd have gotten everything out of Velen before his death. But with how little he's been utilized it is just a waste of a character. <br />
<br />
Also I am taking into account that this is &quot;Draenor Velen.&quot; Blizzard has mentioned that &quot;Azeroth Velen&quot; is not going through the portal at least at the start. The issue still stands that there could have been an active Velen doing his work to actually lead his people rather than taking his &quot;Wait and see, things will unfold&quot; stance that he has all too commonly. Killing off the Velen that we would otherwise be interacting with in WoD still leaves us out a potential character that has otherwise been wasted in general in WoW.</div></div><hr />

Can get a bit meh, esp if they do the annoying auto accept, thats bugged me a bit in wow sometimes, but still, its always better to have greater variety.<br />
<br />
Yeah rift has the same idea as SWTOR, though i believe the bonus objectives in SWTOR and bound to that quest, while in Rift they are seperate special quests. The player housing reminds of me of the dimension in Rift too</div></div><hr />

Framerate problems today are usually more fillrate (from several layers of effects on top of each other) problems and less polygon problems. Graphics cards today can push fantastic ammounts of polygons. It's the textures and the layers of effects that cause fillrate peaks (and then there is the data traffic problem between clients, big lag spikes we had in SoD where caused by fast smart heal features during heroism, so blizzard slowed them down but increased the heal/tick).</div></div><hr />

Well guess what children, horde and orc fans who to put up with seeing fan favorites like nazgrim die as a boss, and now having to see ner'zhul, bladefist, deadeye, and maybe even grom die as bosses in WoD, while having to put up with the writers making them into bad guys.<br />

Suck. It. Up! You don't have a clue how it feels seeing fav lore characters made into scapegoats for loots and bosses. <br />
<br />
On a brighter note, good seeing Thrall in doomhammers armor, but why he'd wear it here is not explained, why would he wear armor they would have been made around this time for orgrim, and carry the doomhammer which would have been made the same.<br />

Durotan was kind of uneventful his introduction, plus, he looks NOTHING like he does in the cinematic poster, he looks just like a generic orc, as does Thrall.</div></div><hr />

Though Velen was willing to get things done, he was generally an advocate of peace. With him gone, however, leadership of the Draenei will likely fall to Maraad and Yrel, Draenei who are far more likely to break their enemy's necks than break bread with them. Killing off Velen may well be unleashing these Draenei and letting them show us how a race as ancient and powerful as they are goes to war.</div></div><hr />

When a Naaru has the light drained from them they turn into a Dark Naaru, simply put. If someone just has a way to drain one they can create Dark Naaru, one such way would be using Void creatures like a Void Lord(Which may be a form of Naaru or not, depending on how far down the rabbit hole you like to speculate.)

I think you might be letting your imagination get away with you. Endgame tanks in WotLK had 50K HP at level 80, this character has 63K at level 91, which doesn't seem like a crazy incline. <br />
<br />
We'll never get back to Vanilla where having 4K HP was considered a lot (in the MC/BWL era anyway)</div></div><hr />

Butterfly effect doesn't pertain to 'alternate realities' exactly... You do realize this is alternate past right?<br />

Although this has me curious, as disconnected as the 'alternate past' is, the aftershock of 'his death' and what it does to this timeline's future is very interesting to me.

LOL WHAT!!<br />
<br />
Time travel to the past might be impossible, but to the future it's not only possible, but also a reality we live everyday when we see anything around us that reflects light.<br />

Stephen Hawking examines how we may some day, travel to the future.<br />
<br />
Translation, it is a theory.<br />
<br />
Also I'm well aware of this theory<br />
<br />
It explains how it would be possible, but with no way to achieve that, there is no way to test it, so &quot;a reality&quot; is beyond stretching it.<br />
<br />
No one knows what would happen if you &quot;time traveled&quot;<br />
<br />
Also I would like to point out that my response was directly related to a comment talking about traveling into the past and how actions would effect the present. You MUST take context into consideration when responding on a forum. I do not see how a theory of future time travel has anything to do with traveling into the past and changing the present, even out of context it isn't pertinent to the conversation at hand.<br />
<br />
Also before you start your comment off so snidely, maybe you should read the context of the situation and respond accordingly.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
In response to your edit:<br />
<br />
Even if you considered that time travel, which I don't, I consider that just quite simply travel, considering that is what it is, that has no bearing on the situation. Like I said, he was talking about traveling back in time, and also, the effects on light have nothing to do with the effects on people.</div></div><hr />

Endgame tanks in WotLK had 50K HP at level 80, this character has 63K at level 91, which doesn't seem like a crazy incline. <br />
<br />
We'll never get back to Vanilla where having 4K HP was considered a lot (in the MC/BWL era anyway)<br />
<br />
Yeah that's what I'm saying though, I was hoping that level 100 numbers would look similar to our old level 80 numbers. Looking back, those numbers just had a good &quot;feel&quot; to them. Instead it seems like our level 100 numbers will be exceeding our level 85 numbers...I'd been hoping that Blizz was going to balance things so that level 100 full Mystic geared tanks were in the 60K health ballpark, but instead it looks like maybe they'll be closer to 400K.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Keep in mind, the scaling is also squished. The bigger the numbers the more exponential scaling must be to &quot;feel&quot; the difference. By pushing all the numbers down, scaling doesn't have to be as dramatic. Level 100 players will probably land around 80k with tanks pushing 100k. At least that's my hope.</div></div><hr />

Cairne Bloodhoof =/= The Prophet Velen. And when did I imply that the Horde had anything to do with it. The point is, one of the Alliance leaders that has one of the biggest contributions to the overall lore of the game and some of the most innately powerful abilities (who was also largely left out of the actual game to many peoples' consternation) is killed in the first questing zone. Meanwhile, Alliance players have to have 2 expansions of World of Hordecraft. We can't even kill Garrosh when we defeat him, yet they take Velen out in a questing zone. Dumb as fuck. So agree with maybe they need to lose another 2 million people before they pull there fucking heads out of there asses</div></div><hr />
