Starting May 7, 2008, Epic Weapons and Blizzard Entertainment will be looking for the best original pieces of artwork that show the Lich King Arthas Menethil wielding his trusted runeblade Frostmourne and the Grand Prize Winner will receive a full sized 47&quot; long replica of the Frostmourne sword courtesy of Epic Weapons and a guaranteed entry into the beta test of Wrath of the Lich King! Two runner up winners will also be selected for entry into the upcoming Wrath of the Lich King beta test.<br />

Blizzard Store redirecting to the previous page.<br />
An update was just applied to the store which can cause this problem. Try exiting out of your browser and then returning to the online store, it should work correctly. If it doesn't please let me know. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=6286663305&amp;postId=62858801803&amp;sid=1#1))<br />

Multiboxing in WoW<br />
A user on the european forums (http://forums.wow-europe.com/thread.html?topicId=3982958571&amp;postId=39823603605&amp;sid=1#0) asked Blizzard if it was allowed to play multiple accounts at the same time. Here is a short description from the original post (http://forums.wow-europe.com/thread.html?topicId=3982958571&amp;postId=39823603605&amp;sid=1#0)<br />
<br />
Multiplexing, What is it?<br />
Multiplexing is when someone uses either a program or a &quot;splitter&quot; to allow them to play 5 characters at the same time. For example, the user will press Thunderbolt rank X on the emitter (First character chosen) soon after the 4 other characters will cast the same spell.<br />
<br />
What is &quot;Boxing?&quot;<br />
Boxing is a sport (Ofc) But the term &quot;Boxing refers to a Box, e.g cardboard box. And when 5 of the same class do the same thing, you could call this &quot;Boxing&quot;<br />
We have stated several times that we have nothing against multiboxing. As long as the player controls each of the characters the player may run multiple clients/characters.<br />
This is also a good opportunity to post the following tutorial explaining how to record multiple instances of WoW on the same computer. <br />

<br />
Multiboxing the name you actually explained pretty well, though you forgot to mention that you actually have to own as many game retail boxes as characters you want to play at the same time.<br />
<br />
Also Multiplexing is not really an accurate term. Most of us use Keyboard Broadcasting that sends the actual Keypress to all the wow instances. Hereby activating manually each character to cast the spell. The other characters do not copy what the first one does. They do what the keypress that is sent to the game tells them to.<br />
<br />
The way you explained it would mean botting and automated gameplay which would be against ToS and botting. Thereby would get the following accounts at least banned, if not all of them.</div></div><hr />

Box = computer. This term as been used for as long as I've been online (mid 90's), and most likely before that as well.<br />

Multiboxing = using more than one computer.<br />

That's all there's to it. Boxing, as in the sport? Game boxes? No.</div></div><hr />

There's a more accurate FAQ about multiboxing here: http://vboxing.net/faq<br />

http://www.dual-boxing.com has an awesome community that can help new multiboxers learn how to get their own rig set up, whether it be multiple wow clients on one machine, multiple wow clients on multiple machines, or multiple machines per wow client. Highly recommended.<br />

You don't need more than one to dual, tri- or even V-box. Hence I have always, and will in the future be taking it to mean the number of game accounts or game boxes you need to have to play that many characters. Which is clearly the most logical meaning in the context.</div></div><hr />

What some random kid posts a 'informational post' on your forums so you decide to put it on the front page? Did you even bother to check or read what he wrote?<br />
<br />
I must say I am sincerely disappointed with who ever runs this site.... Seriously, 'multiplexing' what the fuck were you thinking?<br />

Maybe it would get updated if people weren't such jerks with their corrections, and even to each other. This is like 15 year olds fighting over their favorite music genres...<br />
<br />
Anyway, the term multiboxing is older than WoW. It typically refers to using more than one computer. In the context of WoW, and other pay to play games, it could just as easily be used in reference to the amount of game accounts needed to do it. The proper term (as mentioned later in the thread) for that is multi-instancing, as you are running more than one instance of WoW on the same computer.<br />
<br />
Which method is preferred doesn't really matter. It's cheaper all around to do multi-instancing though, and anyone looking to get into it for cheap would be better off with this way first. The terminology used really doesn't matter as long as its clarified, as different communities tend to arrive to their own unique words/means for things.</div></div><hr />
