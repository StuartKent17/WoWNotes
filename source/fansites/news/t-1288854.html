<br />
RNG and Loot Systems<br />
Why not have something similar for PvE? Why not? I know there are valor and justice points but they don't cover everything. Weapons would be a good example. <br />
Just my opinion, since I feel this is an interesting topic to talk about...<br />
One of the aspects that makes raiding (and PVE) so exciting is the fact you don't know what will drop and when. It's not the first time I find myself in a position where I'm chasing a particular drop and it just keeps evading me *forever*. It is, indeed, rather frustrating when you consider it from the perspective of the person that wants to finally get that new shield or bracers or whichever.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, though, and this is where I think it'd make PVE less attractive is that, if you can plan for certain which upgrades you'll be getting, and when, then, there might not be enough reason to progress past certain bosses. Say, your guild has a hell of a time trying to kill Megaera. Under such a system, you'd still be rewarded with a Tier 15 helm token after some time, despite that one dropping only from the Twin Consorts. And therefore, losing part of the incentive to keep pushing your raid progress to that boss as well as getting rewarded just for showing up on the instance and doing some progress.<br />
<br />
Also, the Valor Point items do ensure you'll be able to get items within a reasonable timeframe, of course, you might argue you'd like to get gear faster, but the fact is that you can control to some extent when you'll get something. <br />
<br />
Putting those things into perspective, sure, weapons may feel harder to attain since you can't get them through Valor Points, but, if you could carefully plan item by item when and how you'll get each upgrade, wouldn't that remove that excitement of finally getting the item you've been chasing for so long?<br />
<br />
please explain where the excitement is of going through raid after raid &amp; the item (weapon in this case), just never drops? oh look, another raid &amp; yet again nothing drops...i can hardly contain myself until next week when i get yet another chance to try my luck. oh the excitement of it all. put in that context, would you really think its enjoyable to go through yet another LFR only to find it doesnt drop again? <br />
Now talking about weapons... how often has it really occurred to any of you that you've never had a weapon drop for an entire tier? Personally I've never been in that position. Have I gotten my weapon late in a tier? Yes. Have I gotten it soon after a tier had launched? Yes. That's RNG. I'd wager if most people could plan their upgrades, weapons might be on the number one spot (depending on the class, of course).<br />
<br />
But above all that, the underlying question isn't just convenience, but rather it branches into two things:<br />
<br />
-Why do we want to get rid of RNG? Because we can't control drops? Why is that negative if you're having fun playing the game? If someone out there wants to get all the items as soon as possible so he/she can stop playing the game as soon as possible, then maybe the proper question should be... are you having fun in WoW? Because the moment we start thinking on the quickest way to get everything done and then not come back until a new patch has been released might be a sign of needing some time to disconnect from the game.<br />
<br />
-Once you control your drops, what's next? removing RNG from quests? from things like which artifact you'll get next on Archaeology or which jewel pattern you'll learn on that next research?<br />
<br />
RNG does have a positive aspect for the game. Sure, it makes it unconvenient when we're trying to control everything, but I believe it ultimately falls back to the &quot;having fun&quot; aspect of all this. Would you have fun in a game where you can control everything? For an extended period of time?<br />
<br />
No RNG there, but hey, I guess there's a reason companies pay you a pre-determined sum of money each month rather than by handing you an random item you may or may not find use for. I like my job a lot and having a random reward system wouldn't make it more fun. <br />
But this is a game, not a job. It should be fun, if it feels like just an obligation... what's the point? I mean, from what some of you are expressing, it sounds like you feel obligated to play and the loot is forcing you to play longer than you'd like. Isn't that an odd sentiment to have?<br />
<br />
A table of gear comes out, where you can CHOOSE whether you want the tanking gloves(which you have) or the tanking shoulders (which is whole new and exciting!) Then you don't have a chance of getting a set of fine armor which you already have. I've tried this too many times. It comes up on my bonus roll and i get all excited until i see it's the same damn boot or shoulder that i already have gotten 3 times! <br />
<br />
Conclusion: It would be nice to actually choose the armor you want if you should be so lucky to finally get a loot (which is rare these days LFR). Don't hate, this was just a crazy yet awesome (in my opinion) idea that fell into my little mind! <br />
But we don't have just LFR, there're normal and Heroic raids. A player running LFR and Normal/Heroic using such a system could probably pick the perfect gear for himself quite quickly. One thing is frustration with not getting loot on the Raid Finder (which is something that may be alleviated in 5.3) and a different thing to have a system where you can basically cherry pick the gear you want to perfectly cover each slot. It takes a lot of that excitement I mentioned.<br />
<br />
Players should get loot for EVERY boss they kill. It's simple as that. You go, you kill, you loot. There can't be nothing else, since the game is not about the lore, story or immersion anymore, but pew pew and lewt. Truth be told. <br />
That's never been the case in the game. <br />
<br />
If blizzard wants to change this, they should emphasise on the lore and story. Yes, there will be losses, but when the design revolves around killing LFR Tsulong (with THIS char) 20 ACTUAL times and never getting the bloody trinket he drops<br />
But there were other options, right? You could get other trinkets if the one from Tsulong just refused to drop (which in the other hand, you can safely say is bad luck after so many kills).<br />
<br />
Nobody wants to take RNG away. And nobody talks about getting everything as fast as possible. We want to see Progress in Raiding. Either in Raid-Progress or in IL/Loot. All in good time is a different thing than &quot;Well you will get that Item without alternative maybe never, thats RNG&quot; <br />
It's just, we can't simply reduce it to &quot;hey, we want progress in raiding&quot;. Sure, I bet that's a cool idea for many, but it has consequences on other aspects of the game, and that's what I find interesting, discussing those things. If we reduced everything to the perspective that makes our arguments valid, we would probably just limit ourselves to post either &quot;hey, this is cool, we'll pass it along and see what the developers say&quot; or &quot;hey, sorry but the developers are not considering this&quot;. Is that the kind of interaction you'd like from the blues? I'm genuinely curious.<br />
<br />
My DK friend still has no sha touched weapon and he's using the weapon from msv. I dont have my sha touched weapon either, but at least I have the healing mace from MSV upgraded. It's stupid how easy it is to obtain the sha touched gem but getting the weapon simply wont happen. <br />
<br />
I have never gotten my weapon from toes. The drop rate for weapons needs to be increased then people wouldn't be so upset on the matter. <br />
Ah! But he's using a weapon from that tier! <br />
<br />
Of course, not the one he wanted, but one from it. You can say it felt getting sha touched weapons was too hard which is a valid argument, but it doesn't make my point any less valid, he did get an upgrade. So perhaps the thing isn't just RNG or RNG not, and it's more about... are the items and the effort required to get to them truly rewarding? Let's say Jin'rokh dropped the best weapons of this tier. And only weapons. Would it be as satisfying to finally get them as if they dropped only from Lei Shen?<br />
<br />
I'm not sure you understand where I'm trying to get to. I think discussions like this (about loot systems in wow) are indeed interesting, and I'm 100% sure they provide useful feedback to the developers. It doesn't mean they'll necessarily implement anything of what you've mentioned here, but it'll make them have a better perspective of what the community thinks about this and might even give them a few ideas of their own on how to tackle those things they might also perceive as issues.<br />
<br />
In short, don't focus too much on if I'm rebating your arguments. That's not the point of my posts, in the end it isn't me who you need to convince of anything and there's no gain in happily sitting down and saying &quot;sure, this is all good!&quot;. If I'm asking something it's not to be dismissive, just to give more flesh to the discussion and allow more people to chime in with their thoughts. The more (ideas and perspectives), the merrier, because that's what makes these things so interesting.<br />

will there be leeway for healers to take part in hc scenarios?seems a shame if we miss out on stuff just because we arent dps<br />
You can heal them. It should allow the other two players to pull more stuff or move faster. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/323145252540121089))<br />
<br />
The need for real cooperation made WoW great; now absent before normal mode raiding. LFG/LFR == &quot;RaidVille&quot;<br />
A small percentage of players cooperated. Most just leveled and then rolled an alt or stopped playing. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/319168219418087425))<br />
<br />
What about making loot depending on the composition? 5 shamans in 10man raid - bigger chance mail dropped? 10 man is hurt now<br />
We actually like the different types of loot encouraging (but not mandating) class diversity. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/318798891304767488))<br />
Benching friends and family because they are not diverse enough sucks. Many 10 mans are built around friend/family.<br />
That's totally a philosophy we support. It just may not be the most efficient way to play, if that's important to you. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/318888725344043008))<br />
<br />
why do you add components like brawlers guild and challenge modes if you got no time left for normal 5 mans anymore?<br />
You're making an apples to oranges comparison. Consider the amount of dungeon architecture in say Stormstout Brewery. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/318888487120146432))<br />
<br />
Please stop making everything doable by a randomly assembled group. Yes, I know about challenge mode. No loot.<br />
We're considering heroic scenarios requiring a pre-made group. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/318800547434094592))<br />
I could see these going well, but I'd really like to see punishing 5-mans return. *I* like challenge modes, but friends don't.<br />
The problem we had before was making matchmade dungeons that were essential to progression too challenging. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/318818981807009792))<br />
It's possible if you could run matchmaking dungeons to gear for LFR that heroic premade dungeons could also still exist. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/318818868984442880))<br />
<br />
Does the ptr provide you with enough or proper feedback to tune raids?<br />
High end - yes. Heroic guilds bring their whole raid and give us lots of numbers and feedback. LFR is pretty easy to test. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/322438197571358721))<br />
Normal is the most challenging - PTR raiding is just not something in the DNA of many of those guilds (understandably). (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/322438393818648576))<br />
<br />
Did you ever consider making Lesser Charm of Good Fortune available for Justice Points or BoA? I h8 doing dailies after exalted..<br />
Elder Charms perhaps, but we don't want Lesser Charms to be grindable that quickly. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/322395592858955776))<br />
<br />
Can you do anything about duplicate gear in Raid Finder? It isn't fun to get the same item three times...<br />
We might let &quot;bad streak protection&quot; apply to duplicate items as well but we haven't decided for sure. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/322395051021975552))<br />
<br />
Clarification on the bonus roll protection. Does it work on rolls in normal raids as well as lfr? and in current content?<br />
Not sure yet, but my guess is we'll do all bonus rolls and LFR personal loot. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/322392966075412481))<br />
<br />
Also, this reads like you are planning to lower drop rates to adjust for the new loot system fix in 5.3. True?<br />
That's not something we want to do. Just clarifying that the goal is to avoid bad streaks not to let everyone gear up faster. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/322077206295764992))<br />
<br />
Interesting idea from forums to help tank/heal queues: give healers/tanks BoA token that lets dps alt go to front of queue.<br />
I fear the experience won't be good for everyone if players with no interest or skill in tanking do it just for other rewards. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/321664806933368832))<br />
Was me. Do u fear cmplaints frm excsive Q &gt; so so tanks. DPS might tolerate tnks more if they tried it.<br />
Yeah, true and the right rewards could encourage someone who is ambivalent to tank. Just don't want to force undesirable behavior. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/321771155511975937))<br />

Because, you know, there's nothing fun about it.

I almost want to go over to the official thread and tell the sad tale of my first max level character, who in their first heroic got the 2handed mace from Maiden of Grief, then didn't see a weapon (of any sort, not just useable ones) drop for the next 18 months until 2 weeks before 4.0, when a 2 handed sword upgrade dropped, a DK won it, and promptly disenchanted it. When cata hit I took her over to Mt. Hyjal, did the first 5 quests, got a massive green upgrade, and haven't played her since.<br />

I find it funny that we have replaced the occasional troll in LFR from DS with the full time troll that is the current LFR system.<br />
<br />
Random small chance that you &quot;win&quot;, then a 1 in X chance to win an item that may be useless or an item that you already have. And guess what? It never changes! Bad odds are bad till the end. Has anyone actually filled every slot through LFR?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Don't be dense. The old loot layout in LFR was awful; people just now say they &quot;liked&quot; it more because they could see if a relevant item dropped, even if someone else won it. <br />

Can you prove that the odds of getting an item now are lower than the odds of getting an item back in DS LFR? As I remember, Blizzard has said the chances should be equivalent. <br />

Maybe weapons should be constructed from raid boss drops, but that would delay the &quot;lucky&quot; people.<br />

<br />
Btw...funny that the bluepost mentioned fun in the same breath as RNG. <br />
<br />
Because, you know, there's nothing fun about it. After weeks (months!) of not getting the drop, not having something to spend vp/jp on, and LFR giving the same drops over and over (but rarely, if ever, what you need) there isn't this overwhelming feeling of excitement when something finally DOES drop--it's a sort of, &quot;Meh, finally,&quot; sense of relief, and then you continue on to the next queue or the next reg/roic raid.<br />
<br />
I've never felt more stagnated in my progression than I have felt in MoP, which is odd, because LFR supposedly makes content so accessible.<br />
<br />
So you're playing 'just' to get loot? Surely that means that the loot, isn't the issue but rather what you're playing is.</div></div><hr />

There are 2 main rogues in our guild, one (me) can't get weapons to drop for the life of me, I'm still using a LFR Sha Touched dagger and I lucked out getting a MSV Heroic dagger off the dogs.. from a coin! I say this knowing the meaning of the word... I LITERALLY have not gotten one weapon from a boss to drop, only time has been though the bonus rolls.<br />

The other rogue on the other hand has gotten latest weapons left and right, even after he no longer needs they drop.<br />

<br />
Spellcasters, some melee, tanks, and heals don't require so much on weapon dps to perform well. Of course it helps, but a new weapon for a WW monk is such a giant dps increase, that it's very important that we get said weapon drop.<br />
<br />
The non-weapon dependent classes can get competitive items through valor. So can melee, but they don't do us as much good. So valor is inherently biased towards those classes that don't benefit greatly from weapons. <br />
<br />
There are no crafted weapons either, or BoE weapons like in cata to purchase. Every weapon drop comes from a boss, and so melee are in a weaker spot because of it.<br />
<br />
Blizzard has options. <br />
<br />
1. Put in crafted weapons of the current tier. The problem with this is simply that the market would be overran with them fairly quickly, thus negating the grind for valor or raiding. This probably won't be done.<br />
<br />
2. BoE weapons. Worked well in cata imo. Soul Blade anyone? They were rare enough that you either got one randomly, or you could pay a ton of money to get one. <br />
<br />
3. Make weapons purchaseable by valor. It should only be available at exhalted though, to make it so if someone has went very far through a tier, with no luck, they should have the option to FINALLY upgrade. I personally think this is the best solution.</div></div><hr />

The old loot layout in LFR was awful; people just now say they &quot;liked&quot; it more because they could see if a relevant item dropped, even if someone else won it. <br />
<br />
Maybe that's true, or maybe they don't like going weeks and weeks winning nothing but junk they already have or don't need. How exactly is that any better than the old system? Does it matter if the afker in the corner wins something and you don't but since you can't see it its better? Only thing this change did was take away the option to be trolled by players so you could be trolled always by blizzard. They took a wrecking ball to solve a problem when a hammer would have done a better job.<br />
<br />
<br />
Can you prove that the odds of getting an item now are lower than the odds of getting an item back in DS LFR? As I remember, Blizzard has said the chances should be equivalent. <br />
<br />
Nope since blizzard doesn't show statistics. Can you prove your winning doesn't effect me? Nope for the exact same reasons. What I can prove is that in the old system the longer it went on the better your odds got of winning something because fewer and fewer people would need it. In the current system you may never win something off a boss who has something you need let alone win the item you actually need. this also doesn't take into acct gear that would be passed to you by other players. I probably won 3+ peices from people who rolled and won something and then handed it out to me because, &quot;your dps is great.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
I did.<br />
Link?<br />
<br />
I only run LFR if I absolutely have too or if our guildies are running it. The place is a personnel nightmare and a loot nightmare. Black hole that sucks up all your time and sanity.<br />

They should drop the &quot;win&quot; rate a tiny bit and then if you win you can choose whatever you off that loot table. This would have solved the problem with people wanting alt spec gear and made it less frustrating to win the same item over and over.</div></div><hr />

The difference from the old system is that you don't compete with other players for gear. Your chances of winning something are independent from theirs, and even if the afker standing in the corner wins something, it doesn't decrease your chances of winning an item you want. Essentially it takes out the ninja/trading/class imbalance factors that made it even less likely for you to win something in DS LFR. Yes you will still go for periods without winning stuff or win stuff that you don't need. The same thing can and does happen in normal raids. LFR is not meant to give you gear faster than normal/heroic, and it IS meant to have a big RNG factor.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sajek</div><div class="date">2013-04-17, 08:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The blue is right, RNG, in a weird way makes things more fun when you DO get something. I've played since Vanilla (I've had hiatuses but played heavily in all expansions), as hardcore raider as they come (except last 2 xpacs, took its toll on life). Now I'm much more casual and I do raid, mostly LFR these days since I just came back 3 weeks ago to try MoP. As in Cata, MoP tries to allow everyone to experience everything and gear up quickly which makes a *lot* of things mindblowingly easier than any previous expansion ever did.<br />
<br />
All the queuing for everything certainly has it's plusses since I can quickly jump in and do what I want when I play. I don't need to have 2, 4, 9 or even 24 friends to do stuff with but here comes my point with LFR and loot. We end up playing entirely for ourselves, not our friends/raid group. At least in some way, if you're part of a proper raid force, sure you want to get loot but you're also happy when other raid members get things that allow the entire team to progress. In LFR, it's all strangers you have no allegiance to and will probably never see again. If you get frustrated getting nothing due to RNG, it's amplified since not even people you care about get anything. In fact, you have no idea WHO gets anything unless they link it or they loot it from the awesome gold bags...you know what, even if they are strangers, I like to click those links to see exactly what they got. Sure, been doing MoP for only 3 weeks but 25 &quot;rolls&quot; in Throne of Thunder LFR and got 2 minor items...8% drop rate. Never kept stats on my past raiding experiences but I've gone 2 full months in Molten Core not getting anything since priest stuff simply never dropped in our raid so I'm used to that, and my %'s might not have been any better really.<br />
<br />
What makes it frustrating is that 8% for essentially a raid experience that was 100% playing by myself for myself (strangers I'll never see again around me). I'm all for being happy for other people but heck, I don't know who to be happy for! It’s all hidden now.<br />
<br />
I remember I was totally excited when I got Benediction/Anathema in Vanilla since it finally dropped (the quest item anyhow). But you know, the best item I ever got was when I had the special honor of being the first one to get Dragonwrath in Cata because people thought I deserved it. A great feeling to be sure but you know, getting Dragonwrath felt like a total grind. There wasn't the excitement of surprise from a drop, it was just putting in my time, doing funky things on this boss and that boss, then looting this type of item, then looting this other type of item etc... Same would be true if &quot;everything was valor&quot; or &quot;every boss gives you loot&quot;. It makes whatever you get less special and more of a grind, since you only need to put x and y time (and then what!?!).<br />
<br />
The game has changed considerably since its origins and I get it, the masses must be happy as the business can't run on the few skilled/hardcore players but we've lost something along the way. Gear used to be a means to an end to progress and see the content which resulted in being totally excited when my raid first reached Ragnaros, Vashj, and Kil'Jaeden after being stuck on Mu'ru for like a month and a half, not to mention a dozen other bosses. The excitement I feel by reaching an end boss of anything is nil now since I know everyone can see it or has seen it. So I do normal raids instead of LFR and get to see the exact same thing....then say I'm skilled and my team is too and I do heroic raids and get to see the exact same thing. The content has been rendered no longer special, the only difference between LFR/Normal/Heroic is the loot or an “achievement” for doing a heroic mode of whatever.<br />
<br />
We now only play for loot and not content so we get all tied up in a bunch whenever we don't get it....a lot of the content has been rendered much less special. Terrible isn't it?</div></div><hr />

Until someone shows me a link where everyone in the raid won something I will be extremely skeptical on how someone else's roll effects others.

As for DS, I geared up three alts through DS lfr in about 3 months. I might have won 5 useful pieces through all my toons combined since mop. Though to be fair I don't run lfr often and as a result my alts are poorly geared. <br />
<br />
As a final note, I am a fan of RNG. When you win you get excited. Problem is you still have lots of RNG but its almost immediately soured when you &quot;win&quot;, if it can even be called that, an item you don't need. So either they up the &quot;winning&quot; chance or give you more control of what you win.</div></div><hr />

<br />
RNG has always been RNG.<br />
<br />
All of these complaints to suddenly &quot;Change&quot; RNG are idiotic. It's the same way it's always been, SAVE for the charms which give you an extra chance at loot. And people are suddenly complaining RNG is too restrictive?<br />
<br />
I expect in the next expansion they will allow us to spend charms for a chance at a specific item, or have a thumbs up/thumbs down loot table that will allow the game to more accurately fill our needs with the same or similar RNG system.<br />
<br />
Until then the CM's will do their job by defending the systems as an alternative to saying &quot;You're right, it's not great, and we'll have it fixed within a year. &quot;Soon ™&quot;</div></div><hr />

At least before you could choose to pass on crap. Imho, the loot systems are fine, but allow trading of gear we win in LFR to players that shared the kill. Or at least exclude an item we already have if it's going to give us something. Most of the time the item that's a repeat is less vendor gold than winning the bag....</div></div><hr />

<br />
Btw...funny that the bluepost mentioned fun in the same breath as RNG. <br />
<br />
Because, you know, there's nothing fun about it. After weeks (months!) of not getting the drop, not having something to spend vp/jp on, and LFR giving the same drops over and over (but rarely, if ever, what you need) there isn't this overwhelming feeling of excitement when something finally DOES drop--it's a sort of, &quot;Meh, finally,&quot; sense of relief, and then you continue on to the next queue or the next reg/roic raid.<br />
<br />
I've never felt more stagnated in my progression than I have felt in MoP, which is odd, because LFR supposedly makes content so accessible.<br />
<br />
It's not even &quot;artificial&quot;, these systems are designed around gambling and reward theory. This is the most addictive and ultimately psychologically rewarding system that offers a &quot;high&quot; or rush from winning, and you act like it's some sinister plan to trick you into spending time. This is what happens when people burn out. They forget that you just play the game because it's fun, and start seeing that what you once found fun isn't fun the 100,1000th time you doti, and you recognize you were just addicted to an artificially designed system of reward vs failure. Once that appreciation for the rewards vanishes, you burn out and then start blaming anything you can but the actual truth.</div></div><hr />
