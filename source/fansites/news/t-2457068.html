Blizzard finally realizes that raidgroups are killing warmode. <br />
<br />
Hopefully they take the next step: separating raidgroups from 1-5mans via sharding.</div></div><hr />

So let me get this right, you want to get more Alliance players to turn warmode on but you want them to go 1 v 5+ SOLO? <br />
<br />
<br />
Allowing it to be completed in a raid focused too much of that aggression in one place in one large group. This change spreads the fight out into more parts of the world.<br />
You create Assaults in ONE part of the world..... encourage people to ATTACK this one spot in Defense or Offense. So there will be about 20-60 players in the area at ONE TIME. But you want them to go SOLO in Warmode to kill 25 of the opposing faction?<br />
<br />
How does a healer kill any player in a grp of 5+ with little damage output but can outheal the damage they take in? <br />
<br />
How does a Pure DPS kill someone i a grp of 5+ with no healing support?<br />
<br />
How does a Tank kill someone in a grp of 5+ with no healing support and little damage output?<br />
<br />
You want to encourage WAR in Warcraft, but you want players to do it SOLO? Wars are not fought 1 v many and they come out alive. We are not Tyrande, Malfurion, Sylvanyas, Anduin, Nathanos, Saurfang. You know the NPCs who can CRUSH all enemies. <br />
<br />
So now we must go out “Against Overwhelming Odds” in Warmode and fight an entire army or small squad as a Lone Soldier.......... Guess I will be skipping out on this. I did the Drustvar Assault on Tuesday, it was a Blast seeing about 50 Horde and 50ish Alliance duking it out in Drustvar. It was great, the Horde pushed up and fought to Arom Strand and kept it for a bit til Alliance routed them all the way back to the farm. this was back and forth for about 90minutes til I had to go do RL things. That was the first time I did PvP since CLASSIC. And it was FUN. We were a Raid ARMY fighting a battle but now......... we must become the lone soldier who can take on the world without a scratch and die ONE HUNDRED deaths, just to get those 25 kills because, why should we be allowed to have a good time in this game huh.......</div></div><hr />

<br />
I recall back in original WoW when I bothered to PvP, half the fun of the huge battles was in raid groups forming (Tarren Mill vs Southshore etc), as people would coordinate more, and everyone could have a go. People would protect the healers, and rogues would attack outlyers like Mages/Priests who weren't being covered by a plate team.<br />
Was part of what made the WPvP feel epic, and part of a genuine faction war.<br />
If people completing the quest was too easy, then increase the cap, but make it raidable. Killing 600 players in a week in a raid is easy enough to do if you enjoy that stuff, and also encourages a WPvP mentality on the server.<br />
<br />
Seriously, speaking as a casual solo player now, not every fucking thing has to be catered to me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That sounds fun. However, it's not fun when only 1 side forms a raidgroup. My last experience playing WoW (October), I was ganked repeatedly after trying to counter a 40man raid with a 7man. It was impossible to form one, no one cared. The zone was simply unplayable for Alliance, for hours on end. The only solution to quest was to join a friend's shard or turn Warmode off.<br />
<br />
I think they should just put raidgroups into their own shards. I like largescale Wpvp *sometimes*. I also don't mind getting ganked now and then. But getting dominated by a 40man for hours on end just isn't worth it. I won't be doing Warmode until raidgroups have to fight each other, instead of picking off soloers.</div></div><hr />

You can still form a party, but no one is having fun gettin farmed by a 40man group, alliance yells for balance entire 8.0 and now they balance it for horde a little bit aswell and you go nuts.

For those who want a TL;DR - Alliance raids good. Horde raids bad.<br />
<br />
To all three of you, tell me this, do you honestly believe that Horde players do not form Raid parties when they do their own Warmode? Do you really think that all those players I was with not ONE horde raid was there either out of about 40ish to 60ish players? <br />
<br />
BOTH sides should be allowed to do it in Warmode not just one side, but kudos for showing just how blind you are to the point. I dont care if it is Alliance or Horde raids if there are a asston of players of opposing factions raping the other in Warmode then BOTH should be allowed to do this in Raids. But good job showing your Horde fanboism. I was actually looking forward to this Horde side tonight on the next Assault. While I was on Zuldazar during their assault time(think it was Zuldazar) I was going up against a strong Horde front and it was cool that I actually had to do covert Ops to get around them and get my objectives completed. And yes I was also ganged up by Horde players there too several times. But that is the Price to pay for Warmode. I turned it on and I got wrecked. It was great. It was war. but I will digress since it is seen that Alliance are the crybabies Horde has it rough......</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't even PVP. I never have WarMode on. But taking out raids? Then it isn't an MMORPG anymore.<br />
<br />
Maybe... just maybe... WarMode is a fail concept? Go back to having PVP realms instead?.... This clearly isn't working out.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Boo Radley</div><div class="date">2018-12-20, 07:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The answer to the War Mode &quot;raids&quot; not allowing quests is simple.<br />
<br />
Instead of allowing groups of 40 to gather up at a flight point or hearth point (like the attacks on dazar alor the day the patch went live) if it was capped at 5 players per group for credit the enemy could at least fight back a little. They wanted player vs player combat to include the chance at actual combat. Its not that hard to understand and honestly a reasonable change on blizz's part.</div></div><hr />
