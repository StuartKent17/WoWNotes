WoWszene.de (http://www.wowszene.de/news.php?extend.1182) got the full text available. <br />
<br />
The expansion is Northrend, etc, etc.<br />
We will fight Arthas himself.<br />
Level cap is 80 (New skills, new talents, etc)<br />
The expansion is designed for lvl 68 and higher players.<br />
The Death Knight class will be available for both alliance and horde players and it seems to work on the same mechanics as Jedi in SWG, you can create them once certain criteria are met. (First hero class of the game)<br />
The Death Knight will combine damage dealing and tanking.<br />
Siege weapons and destructible buildings will be added to PvP<br />
A new battleground will be available<br />
New profession : Inscription. (allows the player to permanently enhance their spells and abilities and to create mysterious items of power to use, trade, and sell.)<br />
More hero classes will be added in the future<br />
Leveling from 70 to 80 should took nearly the same time as 60 to 70 (probably a bit more)<br />
First zone will be Howling Fjord<br />
We should have roughly the same amount of dungeons as BC<br />
<br />
<br />

Of course, these informations aren't officialy from Blizzard, and you should trust them only if you're stupid/intelligent enough to trust this site. (Probability this is real : 70%, according to our fake-o-meter)<br />

We've also got the first screenshot of a Death Knight (http://www.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2007/july/deathknight.jpg) but ... It looks like a fake to me *cough*. Dwarves are biggers.</div></div><hr />

You really dont understand what they mean. They mean that you can only create a death knight once you've done certain things. This means that everyone CANT be a deathknight.<br />
<br />
How common they are depends on the criteria, but it means that everyone in fact cant be one, especially not straight away.</div></div><hr />

I'm too scared to even think of how much Kungen's revenge will hit for now :P<br />
<br />
All in all it sounds like som excellent additions to the game, I'm especially looking forward to how they will create the siege weapons and destructable buildings - sounds like fun :)<br />
<br />
I still have my doubts about the hero classes though - even though I was incredibly hyped about the idea some time, I just think it will take too much balancing to make it all work out :S of course time will tell and new classes are only welcome - Let's just hope that Death Knights dont both have MS and Death coil :P</div></div><hr />

Why would Blizzard make yet another level increase? It will be a pain in the butt to level from 0-80, which will make new players burned out before they even get to the max level.

But i hope it isnt like that... A proffesion that increases spell duration aor redues CD or in creasses spell range sounds more fun and strategical.<br />
<br />
But my main concern is the Hero Class: Deathknight.... I think its done wrong because this way the next expansion will only feature areas for hero classes since other classes will be Under Powered or not accepted in groups/raids and this will only encourage more ppl to buy characters rather than to go through the game and meet al the requirements. Even if this sint the case I still like the Idea of UPGRADING ur current class better.<br />
<br />
But I think I dont have to worry about it because I think this is fake, atleast the herpo class thing, because now everyone would want to be a hero class and after a while u will see less healers and more dps/tanking deathknights. Blizzard said there content was avaiable to all players so there would be a considerable amount of DeathK.. I thinkif Blizzard ould implement HClasses they would add atleas a few at once to give u a selection to start with.<br />

It all sounds very vague which leads me to believe that this is the mere planning of it, and the release will be 1.5 - 2 years away.</div></div><hr />

Both the Death Knight description (starts at a high level?) and this part about character customization cause me to seriously doubt the veracity of this information. Most of it is logical extrapolation based on the original game and the first expansion, and the rest is the pipe dreams that people have posted about on blog sites and forums since BC came out.<br />
<br />
I also agree that the introduction of hero classes is<br />
a) still a ways off<br />
b) going to include more than one initially</div></div><hr />

Also taking another leaf out of City of Heroes book is the concept of high level characters being able to create a new character class.

Although the expansion is Northrend, I don't think Icecrown will be open for a while. I believe its been stated by CM's that we won't fight the Lich King until at least level 90 or 100.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not to mention that both fights are at the best opportunity for the players.<br />
<br />
Ragnaros was resummoned too soon for him to regain his former powers, and as such he is nowhere near that powerful than he was/is.<br />
<br />
Same with C'Thun, first of all he wasn't fully summoned yet, and second of all you weaken him from the inside in the fight.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Synneth</div><div class="date">2007-08-01, 01:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Assuming this is all true...<br />
<br />
I'm interested to see how they implement the Deathknight and thus how they will make it &quot;exclusive&quot;. By making it a raiding pre-requisite it will likely alienate the entire PvP community if the Deathknight is even remotely overpowered compared to &quot;classic&quot; classes; Blizzard made a very good call in judgement by making the arenas a test of skill and team coordination instead of whether you were in a high-end raiding guild.<br />
<br />
If they make it in a way that requires you to have levelled X number of level 70 classes, then those who play one class exclusively are going to be at a massive disadvantage to those who levelled alts. I'm not sure if this is a bad thing or not, but in my opinion access to a special ability should be equal for all and no-one should &quot;start&quot; in a better position to another.<br />
<br />
Then there is the question about the class itself, is it meant to be &quot;exclusive&quot; or is it going to be relatively easy to unlock; my guess is that it will be easy to unlock - something as simple as getting a character to level 70 and performing a quest chain + group quest in a heroic (similar to the epic Druid flight form). Depending on how exclusive it is, what will it's relative powers be; if they make a class to rule all (like the Jedi in SWG) then eventually the game will be made up of 50% Deathknights and 50% the rest, unless they add more &quot;super classes&quot; to keep people coming, in which case the old classes will gradually get phased out.<br />
<br />
Overall I agree with someone above about it being a bad business idea. I think the Deathknight will be reasonably easy to unlock and it'll be no better or worse in relative power than existing classes. If it is better then it's going to cause far more problems for Blizzard than if it's just a &quot;normal&quot; class.<br />
<br />
This is obviously, assuming it's not all a big fat fake. I seem to remember a blue post that they would never add another class until they are happy with the balance of the present classes. Well I'm sorry, but it doesn't take a genius to see that the classes of WoW are not balanced; not in PvE or PvP.</div></div><hr />

Ragnaros wasn't really a god. and C'thun was in a extremely weakened state.<br />

<br />
Judging by how BC rolled out and Blizzard's statement about an expansion every year, their early goal will probably be around the same time as BC, and I wouldn't expect them to even try to rush it out sooner. Even though we know there will be problems/imperfections/things-not-quite-ready at launch, they will (as they did before) try to have things as fine-tuned as possible.<br />
<br />
Their internal estimate will probably be January, but they won't announce an expected release date for months yet (closer to the end of this year) and it will probably migrate deeper into the year. Spring 2008 at the earliest, with a possible pushback to summer.</div></div><hr />

I would have to level alts to 70 because continuing on my main would be a waste of time. <br />
<br />
<br />
Because it hasn't been released. This is all speculation and does NOT mean that it is from Blizzard.</div></div><hr />

Uh, what? Most servers have many, many more people that are not even in end game guilds. How can you sit there and say &quot;70%&quot; (sigh at people making percents up) of the player base has seen it? Sorry, but 70% of WoW isn't raiding and have NOT gone into SSC+. It is mostly casual.

I doubt it hard. permanetly enhance their spells and abilities... it sound a bit OP...<br />
<br />
<br />
A new battleground was already being planned. Also, if you had read it more carefully, you would've noticed that a deathknight char is a new character that you will be able to make once you've fulfilled some crap.<br />
About inscription...sounds alot like a pve sided version of engineering to me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And the fact that you &quot;unlock&quot; it seems a bit odd to me as well, so everyone would have an instant level 80 death knight as soon as they meet the criteria?<br />
<br />
I'm going cautious on this one, no way Blizzard would let ANYONE even a German site get ahold of an FAQ before its announced at Blizzcon..<br />
<br />
Btw: Killing Arthas? Illidan maybe, but not Arthas, he's too much a part of the lore itself, I could understand hurting him severely but they would never come outright and say you KILL him.. if you remember in the BC FAQs they said &quot;you don't kill Illidan as much as get in his way&quot;<br />

Hm, but i think it would kind of suck to roll one on a pvp server, you probably will get ganked every 60sek. (sry just a tought, wont happen, i know ;)<br />
<br />
btw im rly praying for new 20-58 lvling zones.<br />
<br />
Death Knights, is there... i think its possible blizz brings in a new class for both factions but why should it be dk ? cant imagine any plausible cause how they get to horde/alli - and heroclasses ? dont rly think so<br />
<br />
what i'd also like to see is some class made throught combining 2x 70chars. then i could think of still playing without a new lvlcap.<br />
<br />
oh, and needs m0ar animated hugemotes !!!<br />
<br />
edit: killing arthas is kind of the bigest overpowerd faking shait that you could do atm. i wuld buy the exp just for the reason that i could gimp upthere and get my ass kicked by that crazyassmofo.<br />
<br />
im just to curious what happens after the epx. atm we just reroll everything we have seen in wc1/2/3. but after arthas (kk there are a lot of things that happend beside the mainstory) there is nothing we can prepare for. I love the fact to see the story go further<br />

They're letting you take a shot at &quot;beating&quot; Arthas. I doubt Arthas will be felled so easily. After all, Blizzard already has Kel'thuzad and Kael'thas as prime examples of bosses who were beaten but not quite dead.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. The majority of this is fake because this seems like a bad idea from a business perspective. <br />
<br />
2. This is real, and Blizzard is simply getting desperate. Why? Not sure. We have 9 million players and they make plenty of money, which makes me think my first thought is more realistic. <br />
<br />
<br />
Why would Blizzard make yet another level increase? It will be a pain in the butt to level from 0-80, which will make new players burned out before they even get to the max level. Not only that, but how long did we wait for the 1st expansion? Nearly 3 years? And we're already talking about a new expansion, which is retarded because 70% of the player-base will never see SSC, TK, BT, or Hyjal. Did I mention all of the current content will become obsolete just like Naxx did? <br />
<br />
<br />

Then i think it will have to do with the burning legion(Kael never died therefore he is plotting with kil'jaeden) if you recall from the quest where you turn in kael's orb thing he then comes and yells in shatt saying something about &quot;the master&quot; if he is working with burning legion that's referring to Sargeras*spell check* ending with the end of WoW with us killing sargeras(we probably knock off most of the other lore characters between the way those i skipped that is)</div></div><hr />

But ending the lore of major characters from a SINGLE PLAYER game in a multi-player hardcore raid only is complete and pure, inexcusable BS. Uther was a peripheral character who died in order to tell Arthas' story, so what, this is to tell the story of 25 wankers who sat there and slowly beat the Lich King to death? wow. awesome.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cyraneth</div><div class="date">2007-08-01, 05:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ouch... This sounds bad, if it's true.. :o<br />
<br />
First off, if they make only one Hero Class for WotLK, everybody will want to play that. And yes, everybody will eventually get their hands on it if it's in the expansion. Just think of the Netherdrake.. Everybody's riding that over-sized lizard now, and there's not really much prestige about it anymore. And the devs have already stated they're making content for the masses, not for the select few.<br />
<br />
Imagine the first 25-man raid in Northrend... Everybody will be arguing about who's gotta STFU and log off their Death Knight and fetch a healer alt instead 'cause otherwise they'll all be Shadow-using melee DpS and semi-tanks... Hopeless. :P<br />
<br />
I mean, why force the players to reroll a new character after they &quot;unlock&quot; the Death Knight? I don't want new stuff I can only enjoy if I reroll. I want new stuff for my character! Give existing classes the option of transcending into Hero Classes instead of having players start a new character and leave their mains behind to rot. Also, what happens if you've already used your 8 character slots?<br />
<br />
And why oh why make Inscription? That profession sounds borked already.. You're basically forced to pick it up to enhance all your skills and spells, then you can switch back to your old stuff, or what? No, if they want to add a new profession, add the long-requested Carpentry (AKA Woodworking).. How about a way to craft bows? Arrows? Staves? Campfire tinder, even?<br />

I'm sure you posting it right now had nothing to do with the expansion, no matter how you phrased it.

2. This is real, and Blizzard is simply getting desperate. Why? Not sure. We have 9 million players and they make plenty of money, which makes me think my first thought is more realistic. <br />
<br />
<br />
Why would Blizzard make yet another level increase? It will be a pain in the butt to level from 0-80, which will make new players burned out before they even get to the max level. Not only that, but how long did we wait for the 1st expansion? Nearly 3 years? And we're already talking about a new expansion, which is retarded because 70% of the player-base will never see SSC, TK, BT, or Hyjal. Did I mention all of the current content will become obsolete just like Naxx did? <br />

How is it bad from a business perspective to have most of your 9 million subscribers buy another expansion, I don't understand. Even if, at worst, only 1/2 the people buy the next expansion... thats an instant kick of a fair sum of money into their pockets, even after paying all their fees to the distributors. <br />
<br />
I don't understand how you can say more content is bad. If people can't beat SSC / TK right now, like most of my guild, another year or two's worth of trying is only going to get them pissed off and for them to stop trying. Having people beat their heads against the wall only means less subscribers, which would be ...bad from a business perspective! <br />
<br />
New expansion means they can start out fresh on level footing (pretty much, as level as they're going to get). And try again. Do you honestly expect blizzard (and thus everyone) to wait for the majority of gamers to figure out how to dodge lurker spouts and such like? A lot of this new expansion content, even Naxx, wasn't meant for even close to the majority of gamers. It was something to strive for. If people aren't good enough or can't find good enough people to play with, they'll have nothing to strive for. People with nothing to strive for quit and play something else. Therefor you make new content every year. Preeeeetty simple.<br />
<br />
My mind is boggled with your logic, I'm afraid. Blizzard getting desperate? Blizzard has been saying they were gonna do this for awhile now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The hero classes do sounds very interesting but I hope a death knight cant be selectable by all classes. (Odd for a druid to suddenly be a death knight as someone said before)<br />
<br />
Rather I think it would be a better fit for say a shaman to at 80 to become a far seer, a rouge a blademaster, or a lock a necromancer or lich or maybe even the deathknight. I think the old Secret of mana game did that and though you picked your class you went into it was a cool system.<br />
<br />
However if a deathknight class specifically were to be universally pickable by even only the high levels with content unlocked... How would the alliance use them? Warlocks are one thing but think WarII. Palis were the opposites of DKs. (Which raises the question why were shamans put their and not DKs at first... Oh well different topic and obviously not my best argument now that I look at it.)<br />
<br />
But for people who would be skipping the 70 stuff I hope the green items you get from quests wouldnt be as uber as the epics you would be getting from BT. I understand the reasoning for it but I would rather have early 71 on be super easy for Black temple runners and medium for skippers than equal. (Skill aside just something that bothered me nothing big)<br />
<br />
As for the new profession I doubt the buffs would be huge more like enchanters enchanting their own rings.<br />
<br />
Next up... I personally I would much prefer a WarIV hero taking down arthas or no one at all. Archimonde annoyed me a lot (not to say I have beaten him or even attempted) in the sense that even with help he is even phased. I am remembering the last level of WarIII RoC that when archimonde came in your base with divine armor you went to your next place to defend because that first human base and second orc base got fucked over quickly. My point being 25 footmen / mages / tauren etc etc beating (killing or not) a badass from the lore isn't as pleasing as an epic cutscene of sorts. ( Oh and I realize the players dont really kill archimonde but... Think about a lowly non hero taking a smack from one of the most powerful being in existance and 'tanking' him.) Oh well another personal annoyance.<br />
<br />
Lastly (finally I know) I would hope before northrend is overrun with raids that the naga / ashzara / old god water elemental version of ragnaros (I think that has pretty much been said by now with the 1000 hints) aren't forgotten. I hope all understand that lady Vashj was not the leader of all the naga and that very cool (maybe underwater :D) fights may remain.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaziel</div><div class="date">2007-08-02, 05:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay, just a clarification about the whole Death Knight = Jedi thing, assuming this post is real at all.<br />
<br />
When they refer to the Jedi from SWG they are most likely only talking needing to unlock it before you can access it. In SWG you needed to skill one character up to a certain level on random job trees and it would unlock a new character slot where you could pick &quot;Force-Sensitive&quot; as a player option.<br />
<br />
If they go this route in WoW there are things to realize:<br />
<br />
First off, you won't have to skill up random professions or weapon skills or anything like that. The reason why is professions and weapon skills are not one of the primary focus of WoW. In SWG one of the central aspects of the game was you could pick which skills you want and customize your character like that. Whether or not you thought it was a good design is besides the point, it was central to the game.<br />
<br />
In WoW, the unlocking of the character slot will most likely take the form of a quest. A highly probable scenario is that you need to do repeated runs though 5-mans that has you killing a Death Knight (not Scholomance or Stratholme, but new 5-mans in Northrend) to get a semi-rare drop (2-5%). There are, let's say, three pieces, and once you get all three you combine them into a lifeless Vampiric Runeblade.<br />
<br />
This item starts a long quest chain (and is possibly usable as a weapon, but it only qualifies as a white 2H) where you bring the Vampiric Runeblade to life, slowly lose your soul to it (by having it, for example, drink up the souls of those you kill), and finally throw off the shackles of the Lich King's control, with the final quest either involving another 5-man (possibly heroic) or maybe even a raid (but I doubt the latter).<br />
<br />
Note: For those who think &quot;But I play a (druid/mage/priest/rogue/shaman/warlock) and I can't use 2H swords!&quot; the weapon wouldn't need to be equipped to &quot;lose your soul&quot;. It could either be a usable item that you use on your target's corpses, or just having it in your inventory is enough.<br />
<br />
Upon completing this quest chain you could now create a &quot;new&quot; Death Knight. Said Death Knight would probably start at level 68 or 70, allowing you to bypass the entirety of the &quot;old content&quot;. While this would bring with it, it's own set of problems, that's for a different post.<br />
<br />
Also, Death Knights would not be insanely strong. They would be about on par with the rest of the classes in the game. If they made one class really powerful, even if they planned on releasing other really powerful classes later, it would be unbalancing in the game, plus it would force people to feel like they had to abandon their old characters to keep up with others.</div></div><hr />

<br />
IF they rly bring it in they would know how to implement it (trusting blizz at this point)<br />
and even if the DK wuld be extremly OP they would bring the balance in anyway, maybe by releasing right another op class, but dont know about these Heroclasses, everyone would only play ONE single class, and get bored rlyrly soon</div></div><hr />

There's a difference between this:<br />
Tons of informations were released on an internal source during the night. Probably to let most of the GM know what's going on. <br />
<br />
And this:<br />
None of the information below has been officialy announced by Blizzard, this is only a compilation of information gathered from reliable sources.<br />
<br />
His &quot;source&quot; this time seems to be mainly the Something Awful forums. If it was another internal leak, that's a horse of an entirely different color.</div></div><hr />

Uh, no it isn't. Did you even read his post?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
After I posted the original information, a post appeared on Something Awful with a few extra details and I eventually merged it when it turned out to be ... reliable. The only details added from this post were :<br />
<br />
The &quot;big&quot; changes to the existing lore (I don't want to spoil it again, you know what I'm talking about)<br />
Gnomeregan possibly retaken by gnomes<br />
Blackrock Spire eruption.<br />
<br />
And I think that's it, everything else was from my own personal work and is data gathered from multiple sources over the last month.</div></div><hr />
