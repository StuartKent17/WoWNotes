Someone posted a few questions about the Death Knight and Bornakk was nice enough to answer them, I guess it's always nice to have a small compilation of Death Knight facts (because we don't know much about them actually)<br />
Q: Everyone will roll death knight alts because they start at lvl 60, so they have less work to do.<br />
A: We do hope a lot of people try out the class, it should be a lot of fun. But we also know that people have their preferred style of play so we don't expect everybody to drop their current character(s) and play the Death Knight exclusively. <br />
<br />
Q: It forces you to master a class in high-level areas where you need to know your class to suceed, and most new Death knights won't know how to play their class at all.<br />
A: Just leveling up to reach Northrend will take time and should provide players some great experience in learning the new class. <br />
<br />
Q: Other classes will fall out of favor for alts, because they start at lvl 1, wheras Death Knights start at 60.<br />
A: I'm not sure that other classes falling out of favor as alts is really a big deal, but I wanted to clarify that the starting level of the Death Knight has not been finalized, but they will start at a higher level as a level 1 Death Knight doesn't sound quite right. <br />
<br />
Q: The massive flood of Death Knights will clog battlegrounds, making matches extremely uneven (No class variety, so less heals, druid bufs, etc.)<br />
A: While a lot of people may make Death Knight alts to try out the class, especially near the launch of Wrath of the Lich King, not everybody is going to level them to 80 or switch them to their main character. Also, both factions will be interested in playing the Death Knight, so any lack of heals will probably go both ways. <br />
<br />
Q: The lack of levels to obtain takes away what makes WoW so fun: Leveling up and gaining new abilities.<br />
A: They will still need to level through Outland and Northrend which can take a fair amount of time. <br />
<br />
Q: New players will have to wait months to try a class they may have wanted from the beginning.<br />
A: We have not finalized way that the Death Knight will be unlocked yet, if that is what you are referring to. <br />
<br />
We have wanted to make Hero Classes for a long time and we feel the Death Knight will be a fun one to start with while adding a great new element to the game for players to enjoy fighting with... and against.<br />
<br />
Because we talked about them way back at the launch of the game, a lot of people had or still have a built up idea of what a &quot;hero class&quot; is or should be. But until the Death Knight, they didn't exist, so there was no definition of a Hero Class. <br />
<br />
We don't want a Hero Class to be stronger than the other classes and we don't want to restrict it so only a few of our players can create them. One of the design philosophies that we follow is that we keep our entire playerbase in mind when making things to maximize the fun for everybody, not just a select few. <br />
<br />
Third faction<br />
Not anytime soon, and probably never considering how hard it would be to balance everything.<br />
While hearing murloc noises already makes me shudder, the Alliance and the Horde are a strong basis to build a story of conflict and war for players to experience and we have no plans at this time of adding a third playable faction. We are happy with the way the two factions are &quot;interacting&quot; in the game and plan to continue weaving the story around them. <br />
<br />
Vanish<br />
While we are always evaluating abilities and making changes as appropriate, we have no current plans to change how vanish works. Hope that helps.<br />
<br />
Various info from other websites<br />
The official site was updated with a small Ogri'la guide (http://www.wow-europe.com/en/info/basics/factions/ogrila/index.html), you probably understood everything written here within 10 minutes of questing but I guess it's great if you want to start. (Especially if we consider that I've been slacking on reputation pages).<br />
WoWinsider.com (http://www.wowinsider.com/2007/09/14/map-of-utgarde-keep-and-what-we-know-about-it/) updated the WoWWiki map of Utgarde Keep posted yesterday with a few more information, including various point of interest, you can check it here (http://www.wowinsider.com/2007/09/14/map-of-utgarde-keep-and-what-we-know-about-it/).<br />

Indeed. While any feedback from &quot;blue&quot; is better then none at all, they could be a tad more selective in what to reply to.</div></div><hr />

Holding a runeblade, waving his grey but young hair and spreading genocide and corruption upon the innocent, while being protected by a mourning plated armor.<br />

Currently leveling a Shadow Priest up to 70 then having to slowly progress through the raids again just to hope I get to BT and get his awesome looking t6. Leveling lets you learn the skills and how to use it but I think 60-80 will be plenty of time to learn those skills.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">overneathe</div><div class="date">2007-09-15, 06:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I enjoy it. And if it was not for the moronic lowbies out there I'd keep the levels and actually have some fun doing the old content. Instead I take 2 weeks to grind which is enough to build myself dozens of strategies, learn the new class spells/abilities, and choose the proper spec for my interest.<br />
Blizz is doing the right thing by adding 10 levels. Not sure if I'd buy the expansion if it didn't have that. No levels - no new talents, no new skills, no time to learn to use your unexistent skills and talants, sh*tloads of dungeons and raids with EXTREMELY powerfull items which will take months for attunement and guess what happens if you enter a BG at 70 having those legenderies... It's extremely stupid and I have no idea why people would not like to level. WHAT is the point of 30 more 70 dungeons and 15 more 70 raids? WHAT? Go play an FPS plsktnx.<br />
<br />
Blizz is doing the proper thing by adding 10 more levels and highly increasing XP gain from grinds and quests before 60. They're also making some elite/group quests soloable. If it's how I imagine it I'd be able to make a 60 in about a week actually sleeping every night.<br />
You go Blizz, kill the noobz. ;]</div></div><hr />

Before, it worked wery well..<br />
Now its bugged at many point. I already see a mob attack me after vanish (without stealth detection).<br />
<br />
And they said it works ....<br />

I said, they don't know how to fix it ...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Then why call it a hero class? Just call it what it is, just another new class. &quot;Hero Class&quot; that by itself creates high expectations among the WoW crowd. Expectations that won't be met, therefore people will get dissapponted and left with a cheated feeling.<br />
<br />
I know there are hundreds of different ideas on how hero classes should be like in WoW, if you ask the public. But I think the majority will agree that they thought that hero classes would be superior to the old and stale classes. <br />
<br />
I myself always hoped that the hero classes would be some sort of evolution from the old classes. Therefore not just one class per expansion, but 9 or more. <br />
<br />
If we look at how much actual new gameplay was introduced in TBC, I think we shouldn't expect too much of their 2nd expansion. Just think, how much of the gameplay of the classes has actually changed? Off course some classes have evolved, like mages pvp, but warriors for example still spam Hamstring/MS in pvp and still do stationary tanking where they need to spam their CD's. <br />
<br />
No, TBC is entertaining to a point. But their 2nd expansion won't even be close to the competition who'll release totally new games with actual new gameplay.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">overneathe</div><div class="date">2007-09-16, 12:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You want the answer don't you? All of you? Why HERO classes?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Because they're the heroes from warcraft 3. This is the only answer. The even more proper title for them would be only heroes, but we need to tell everyone they're actually a class.... so hero class. End of story.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dash</div><div class="date">2007-09-16, 03:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Duh, but why make the heroes on the same level/power as the normal classes? What makes a deathknight more heroic then a paladin for example? <br />
<br />
Blizzard wants the deathknight to be something you need to earn, something special. Granted, you probably don't need to do alot to earn the right to roll a deathknight. But apart from the lore and storyline, the deathknight will be nothing more then just another class.<br />
<br />
Combine that fact with the fact that Blizzard will give the existing classes just a handfull of new abilities which will probably have a minimal effect on their gameplay and you get an expansion that will pale to the competing MMO's that will hopefully come out around the same time.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">overneathe</div><div class="date">2007-09-16, 09:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Because Blizz can't spend the time to balance more then 2 (if even that's possible) new classes on an expansion WHILE making the other 2GB of changes.</div></div><hr />
