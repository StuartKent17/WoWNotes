First off, that is not the time frame for an extended maintenance, this is the standard maintenance period for any server take down. The patch will not be this Tuesday. It has seen ZERO time on the background downloader and it's approx. a 2GB patch. At a minimum this patch will be on the background downloader for a week. Also, will the implementation of the wiping the trade in time on items during the maintenance will require that blizzard give several day notice on the patch, as not everyone logs in every day and checks the news. <br />
<br />
If they do go live this week, Blizz would be making a huge mistake.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Your first 2 points here seem to hinge on 4.2 being 2GB. It is nowhere near 2GB. I have access to the 4.2 patch from Blizzard's own patch servers and it's about 409-414 MB with a roughly 5.34 MB tools patch. These are the same URLs that Boub would be talking about in his above post. While large it's not large enough to place a major strain on network infrastructure. With the streaming launcher you would only need to download a portion of this before getting into game so the background downloader isn't really needed for this.<br />
<br />
You can not take the size of the PTR as a comparison. The PTR is meant as a permanent install so when you install it for the first time you are patching from 4.0.0. After that you are meant to just use the launcher to update it. If you haven't done the PTR for a while then it requires you to patch the older builds first. There's also no 14007 build patch files on the PTR so you can't do a direct size comparison that way either.<br />
<br />
Your last point confuses me - why would they need to give advance notice of wiping the trade in time on items ? I've seen nothing in the patch notes about that. Besides Blizzard's never known to be hand holdiy about that sort of thing. If they were doing they would post something to the blog and/or the forums and too bad to anyone that's missed it. Look at the recent authenticator changes which were only on the forums - lot's of people missed that. Didn't stop Blizzard from doing it anyway _then_ putting up a post about it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Enigmah</div><div class="date">2011-06-27, 09:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Let me clarify a bit since my last post was extremely rushed. 4.2 is roughly 2GB, at least that was the amount needed to download if you used the quick install method for PTR testing (Copying patches up to 4.1 from live folder then allowing the DL'er to get the rest). Lets even assume for a moment that the patch were 500mb, they would still have it on the background downloader for a few days at a bare minimum. I can't remember a patch over 100mb that wasnt on the DL'er for some time. Hell on the PTR alone the patches to the patch itself were more than 400mb's, so I'm inclined to call BS on your link to their servers indicating yadda yadda. Simple math &gt; some mysterious back-alley link containing Area 51 patches for Blizz.<br />
<br />
I was very unclear on the item refund issue. With this implementation Blizz quite literally has to announce the date of 4.2 with some advanced notice so that inappropriate purchases aren't locked in. Personally, I feel this should be a week notice, but a few days will suffice for most players. This &quot;feature&quot; was rushed in with a minor post containing poorly worded details on how it worked for one, which leads me to believe they're saying &quot;Hey, start spreading the word that you can't sell items back patch day&quot;...........whenever that might be. It just doesn't work like that, they'll let us know or all hell might break loose.<br />
<br />
Most major content patches have followed one week after an arena season ends as well. While this is not definitive, as they have released the day a season ends, it is still a good indication that the patch is not this week.<br />
<br />
Everyone needs to remember what was said &quot;at the earliest June 28th.&quot; This means no sooner than, but possibly LATER as well. I know MMO wants to push out news to get people to come view the site and all, but they also PROCLAIMED the patch was going to be the 21st, which I quite frankly laughed at as they supposedly have &quot;inside&quot; sources. Any twit with more than 300 brain cells could have told you the 21st wasn't the date for release. <br />
<br />
All in all, could the patch be tomorrow? Ya, I suppose so, but I wouldn't hold my breath unless someone is standing by ready to perform CPR on you.</div></div><hr />

I didn't think I would have to sit here and respond to a troll, but there ya go, a normal scheduled maintenance period taken from the 12th of April. Take into account the 28th being on the official preview page (obviously not confirming anything) for a brief period of time, and the fact that for 2 weeks prior to this tuesday's maintenance we've had rolling restarts.<br />
<br />
Also, in reference to your item-refund policy heads up notice, i'm fairly positive that the weekend before the patch would suffice.<br />

With this implementation Blizz quite literally has to announce the date of 4.2 with some advanced notice so that inappropriate purchases aren't locked in. Personally, I feel this should be a week notice, but a few days will suffice for most players. This &quot;feature&quot; was rushed in with a minor post containing poorly worded details on how it worked for one, which leads me to believe they're saying &quot;Hey, start spreading the word that you can't sell items back patch day&quot;...........whenever that might be. It just doesn't work like that, they'll let us know or all hell might break loose.<br />
<br />
lol @ thinking Blizzard needs to go out of their way on this issue...<br />
<br />
&quot;hell might break loose&quot;.... uh... lol<br />
<br />
Of the possible 2-3 people in all of WoW who might legitimately make that mistake and log right off, well too bad. If you rely on some two hour timer to do your research after the fact, I can't really sympathize.<br />
<br />
The whole point was to catch people gaming the system. The impact to legitimate players is minimal, who the hell buys wrong items from the vendors and then only realizes it the next day? The only way timers actually get used on a day to day basis is in raids, not from people mis-clicking vendors.</div></div><hr />

They are when you still need the equivalent of the &quot;orb&quot; for this new patch. Which will be in very short supply. Everyone may be able to get the <br />
&quot;shards&quot; but not everyone will be dished out the &quot;orbs&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Lets even assume for a moment that the patch were 500mb, they would still have it on the background downloader for a few days at a bare minimum. I can't remember a patch over 100mb that wasnt on the DL'er for some time.

<br />
I have a very long post to type up to refute your &quot;2GB&quot; claim but right now I'm eating breakfast.<br />
<br />
<br />
For now here's something directly from a US tech support blue :<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
Ok, I just found out the 4.2 patch for the US client is just under 400 megs.<br />
<br />
And there were no patches for the PTR that were over 400 MB. I've been on them since they started.</div></div><hr />

Your entire argument appears to rest on 4.2 being 2 GB. Everything that follows appears to be lending strength to that argument with the line of reasoning of &quot;Blizzard needs to give us plenty of advance warning of ____ because of _____&quot;. Once you take into account the fact that Blizzard have given us plenty of advance warning of the thing in question plus has been known in the past to just make changes without informing or warning the player base means the one bit of evidence in your post that has any crecdence on the post coming out this week is the size argument.<br />
<br />
For starters copying the patches files from Live to install the PTR is not a supported method of installing the PTR. You are meant to never de-install and just to update it each time via the launcher. You may say this is a minor difference but in fact it is - the build patch files on the PTR are different from Live. Some will translate over , some will not.<br />
<br />
For example Live goes 13623,13914,14007 PTR has no 13623 or 14007 update files. It goes 13875,13914,14002 then build 14040 in it's build update files. Also the Cache folder in the Data folder has different size between PTR and Live so take that out of your calculations.<br />
<br />
Your PTR launcher probably looked at the files it didn't have and re-downloaded what you had already downloaded on Live as once again the files aren't named the same.<br />
<br />
What you can do is estimate how big a jump 14007 (live build number) to 14040 then add up the rest of the patch files from there. Here I've made some screenshots of my PTR data , updates and data -&gt; enUS folders :<br />

<br />
Lastly I'ld like to reveal here that I'm the Mac Tech Support MVP. So I do have access to avenues of information that a normal player does not. One of those sources give me a bunch of links. I won't share all of them here as I don't want people to try to patch their wow installs ahead of time but here's one :<br />
<br />
http://ak.worldofwarcraft.com.edgesuite.net/wow-pod-retail/NA/12911.direct/Updates/wow-0-14333-Win-final.MPQ<br />
(http://ak.worldofwarcraft.com.edgesuite.net/wow-pod-retail/NA/12911.direct/Updates/wow-0-14333-Win-final.MPQ)<br />
If you look in your wow.mfil file you will see that same URL. This is Blizzard's own patching servers. Don't believe me ? Go take that file out of your wow folder. Then open the Launcher and see it recreate that file. Then open the wow.mfil in your favourite text editor.<br />
<br />
The other links have different file names but the same domain name in the URL (ak.worldofwarcraft.com.edgesuite.net (http://ak.worldofwarcraft.com.edgesuite.net/wow-pod-retail/NA/12911.direct/Updates/wow-0-14333-Win-final.MPQ))<br />
<br />
With the streaming launcher you only have to download 70 % of the patch before you are able to play. Once in game you stream patch data from that domain name on port 80. So players would be downloading at most 330 MB before being able to play and streaming the rest. It won't be a huge strain on network infrastructure so a prepatch download isn't needed.</div></div><hr />

It always ends a week before any major content patch and since there hasn't been one yet, the patch won't be tomorrow.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Enigmah</div><div class="date">2011-06-28, 06:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I stated my reasons. You stated what we already knew, or could reasonably assume to be true, and attempted to bedazzle it. Common sense told me the 21st wasn't going to be the release day despite the &quot;News&quot; saying otherwise. Again, I don't believe it will be released tomorrow and no matter how much sparkle you add to those old jeans, I won't wear them. It's this little thing called an opinion. I mean its not possible that they could simply place a patch there a week before it goes live, right? Or could they *evil laugh*?P.S. If that is the final patch size I'll buy the first round, other than that............thinking of clever retort.......mac's blow. You're not the only one with sources. Go check that other wow information site and the bulk of the news is posted/gathered by an associate, who despite having been leaked info that the patch is suppose to be tomorrow, feels it will not go live either, and that the decision wasn't going to be made until late this evening (more than likely just before maintence)...opps did I just spill some information. So as you can see, your argument has as little, to quote you, &quot;credence&quot; as mine.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That patch came through a while ago I believe, and it was prolly just a tool update or something. I would imagine that MMO is focusing on trying to make the page we see above these comments look prettier for today rather than reporting something that won't make a difference in the long run. <br />
<br />
However, I am curious as to why no-where on the U.S. side of things is there confirmation, and still no downloader data.<br />
<br />
Oh wells, I don't have a cap on my internets - I can wait till after work. :)<br />
<br />
There is a post in the CS forums about the extended downtime, but it doesn't come out and blatantly say &quot;4.2 is today.&quot; <br />
<br />
Silly Blizz and their ability to make me excited.</div></div><hr />
