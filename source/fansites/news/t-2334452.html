<br />
Based on the previous times this has happened, I would expect that you can complete up to a 15 on that week for a new scale item in the cache on the following week, and then that same week (week of the 5th) the higher level drops from the dungeons themselves will open up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
At least since Blackrock Foundry. It would be longer if Wing 2 would release 12th December, because Christmas are 2 weeks later. Maybe they even build schedule around Christmas this time (so we don't have gap longer than 2 weeks).<br />
<br />
Btw, anyone expect thread from that guy again, where he bitch about LFR gating? You know what I'm talking about. ;P</div></div><hr />

Nothing else you enjoy in the game besides lfr? <br />
<br />
Seems odd to only resub once the full lfr is out. Does that mean you resub ... run lfr in full ... and then immediately unsub again at the end of the day after completing it? I ask this since your behavior suggests that your only interest is in 'seeing' lfr. Obviously the gear holds no interest for you as it is only useful if you are running other content in the game, which I'm guessing you don't since you'll only resub when a new and full lfr is available.<br />
<br />
Very confusing and I'm curious.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's not &quot;all I enjoy&quot;, I enjoy leveling, and I enjoy doing new content. It's not like there's going to be a bevy of new content otherwise coming out. If there was, I'd resub. I resubbed when the new hub and dungeon came out too. Then I let it lapse once I finished the storylines and did the dungeon. <br />
<br />
That's what I do. I sub when there's new content added, then I stop subbing once I've finished it to a level in which I'm happy with. If there was no LFR, I'd just resub long enough to do new dungeons and new hubs/storylines, then lapse until there's more.<br />
<br />
(I have no interest in PVP)<br />
<br />
Like, if I resubbed right now, all I'd have to do is repeating content I've already done or doing content, like mythics, which I don't want to do.<br />
<br />
Oh, or level alts, which Legion turned me off of doing until recently. I've leveled a few (I think I have 3 or 4 at 110, though I do have a character of every class at at least 100). Frankly, that's just not mega appealing either.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Given the delay, I'm tempted to wrap things up for now and see how things are looking a little ahead of the next pre-patch.<br />
<br />
LFR only takes a week and, unless my guild somehow magically resurrects itself, that's all I expect to be doing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We deal with Sargeras in the last encounter. You will see what happens to him, or you can just look up spoilers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've not done this before but I have some sympathy with it and may go with it in future.<br />
<br />
The big difference with LFR is you usually to complete it the first time you run it. Some of the bosses might need a few stacks of determination when people are new, don't have great gear or know the bosses. This usually means clear the new LFR wing the day it's released and then wait another 14 days for the next wing. That's not so bad if you have other content to do but, as far as I'm aware, we are pretty much done with content now, aside from the raid, until the pre-patch.<br />
<br />
You mention gear but I already have a higher average gear level than LFR will drop, and I just run world content. Sure you can go for set bonuses but in general you already have all the gear you need for any content short of heroic raiding/mythics. If you run this stuff already I'd expect you to already out gear LFR rewards.<br />
<br />
This is all really to say that I would expect for most people that LFR is just tourist mode, so I don't find it surprising.<br />
<br />
But there will always some people who actually want to farm LFR for the gear or just to get a leg up to the next stage, but I would expect serious raiders to out gear the next tier LFR before it's even released.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well according to Blizzard the majority do and it justifies the raiding development scene.<br />
<br />
Why do you want something removed that you don't have to do? Why or how does it affect you that someone is getting considerably lower item level gear? <br />
<br />
I'll answer that for you. It doesn't. And thankfully you aren't designing the game because you would end up alienating a lot of players by removing something that is completely optional to you.<br />
<br />
According to past dev interviews they stated they want LFR to be just under Normal and KJ was kind of a test when it launched because that had quite a few wipes.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cavox</div><div class="date">2017-11-09, 07:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Why do you want something removed that you don't have to do?

<br />
OH BOY WHERE DO I START<br />
<br />
It's steadily killing raiding guilds since the day it was created. I've personally known a lot of players who came back to WoW, leveled up to [max_level] and did an LFR or two, then got bored and quit again.<br />
<br />
You need motivation to raid, LFR is the most demotivating tool I've ever seen. TBC, vanilla and WotLK were great, because seeing a boss was a reward in itself, not a themepark raid you can literally AFK through.<br />
Is it a coincidence that LFR came out at the same time WoW's population started a dive which hasn't stopped since (Cata)? I think not!<br />
<br />
And of course the statistics will show that people attend LFR raids. Who wouldn't if there's a chance for legendary items, a way to do without ANY effort your weekly raid quests and get some low level tier sets? The problem is that the &quot;here's a raid and 10 difficulty levels - enjoy!&quot; is a shitty approach, which has been discouraging people who might've been real riders if given a chance and some challenge.<br />
Now WoW became a single-player MMO where you queue do to dungeons, queue to do raids, queue to do pvp not moving an inch from [your_faction's_capital]. But that's another story for another time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Then go play Vanilla when it's out. That's what it will be there for if you believe that it was a much better time for raiding. Although if I recall the devs stated that not enough people were seeing the raids hence LFR.<br />
<br />
Right now your statement of LFR should be removed is bordering on arrogance at best.<br />
<br />
So because you know a few players that = majority? Yeah no that's not how it works.<br />
<br />
Ah yes the usual &quot;let's correlate sub loss to LFR directly&quot; argument. Because I haven't heard that one for the 100 billionth time on this site.<br />
<br />
Luckily the devs do not agree with your statement otherwise it would be gone by now. They stated time and time again that without LFR they would not be dedicating as much resources to raiding. <br />
<br />
If you don't like LFR don't do it. Simple as that. You are not forced at all. There are plenty of other methods to obtain Legendaries. Oh and the raid quest works off what difficulty you've done. If you only do Normal you will never see a Heroic chest mission for example.</div></div><hr />

I don't want to play Vanilla, because it was shit - yes, I used to play it back in the days. Give me TBC or WotLK servers and I'll seriously consider it.<br />

I debated your points. If you cannot handle that then maybe you should not be on an online forum rather than trying to play the &quot;think of the children&quot; card.<br />
<br />
The fact is LFR is the reason raiding gets the development time it does. Another fact is that you do not have to do it if you don't want to. Nobody is making you. <br />
<br />
Your opinion is that it is bad for the game. You are of the opinion that a completely optional mode has somehow affected your experience. No what has happened is that because a few people you know only do LFR you think that the majority don't progress. You are basing a majority experience off of your experience with a few people you know.<br />
<br />
And again it seems to be only bad for you here. You really seem to care that someone gets to see an easier version of the raid in which you do not have to participate in. I told you there are plenty of sources other than LFR besides Legendaries. So no you don't have to run LFR at all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thinking raids wouldn't get developed as much without LFR is stupid and you should feel stupid. Post source if you would be so kind, because it's some kind of gold-medal tier of mental gymnastics.<br />
You've either not read my posts or are retarded. I'll leave it with that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
WoW is on a decline because content changing, attitudes from people are changing and the people who liked TBC and so on, a lot are not subbed for varies reasons that are unimportant to your arguement. LFR is just another tool for people to use in the game. If people are bored and quitting because of LFR, the problem isn't LFR, it's the people coming back to play. You can't force entertainment and if they are bored because of LFR, there are other games or even other things in-game they can do. You can just ignore LFR (I do mainly) and play just fine. Most pugs &quot;put in the effort&quot; just fine.</div></div><hr />

LFR justifies the creation of more raid content when millions of players are able to see content. Only a few thousand people actually saw Kel'thuzad, but millions saw Deathwing. The reason Mists of Pandaria is starting with 18 bosses and adding larger raid tiers than we have had previously is because many players are going to see the raids through LFR.<br />
<br />
You were saying?<br />
<br />
So again. It's stated right there from an interview that LFR justifies the creation of more raid content aka more development resources put towards it.<br />
<br />
Where did I say they would barely be developed? I said it was LFR that justifies the amount of increased development raiding has had over the years.</div></div><hr />

Why would anyone put any effort it something they might enjoy if they try (normal/hc raids) if you have an easy-mode version at the tip of your queue button? How hard is it to understand? I don't get it.<br />

I was saying it's mental gymnastics, but ok - you gave me source for that statement. It doesn't mean it's right. Of course Blizzard agrees with you and others defending LFR - that's what I'm disagreeing with. Blizzard isn't always right - just look at the state of world PvP, declining subs.<br />
<br />
And no, the game is old, but that's not the reason people are quiting it. It looks fine and could be 12M+ subs again if Blizzard stopped making a feel-good game for people who play 30 minutes a week and went back to the challenge they lost in WotLK.<br />
<br />
My point about LFR being bad still stands. You want to disagree? Fine.</div></div><hr />

Ah so you ask for a source, given a source and now it's suddenly not correct because of your own biased opinion towards LFR?<br />

Yeah it's clear there is no reasoning with you especially when you yourself asked for evidence on the matter. <br />
<br />
And no your point about LFR being bad is an OPINION. Not a fact.<br />

You are essentially dismissing a provided source because of your own vitriol for LFR.<br />
<br />
But thankfully you or I don't design the game and LFR is here to stay for those who want it. :) Because I wouldn't trust me or half this forum to armchair design the game at all.<br />
<br />
Which means when it's fully open I'm going to grab my 4 set and any minor upgrades and probably hit a Normal pug like I did with ToS.<br />
<br />
Although I'm not sure if those OP trinkets drop in LFR. Will probably try and snag one for alts but not going to put a huge time commitment on them since I don't really like that part of the effect doesn't work in outdoor content.</div></div><hr />

I've met tons of people who play for mythic raids.<br />

Titanforging which relies on luck yes?<br />
<br />
How about we stick to the base item level of each raid? Because Titanforging can happen in ANY difficulty. It's not LFR exclusive. And I see no issue with a possible upgrade happening in LFR. It creates a replay mechanic for those that want to do it without forcing you into it. Relinquished gear actually helps this situation as well due to how easy it is to farm.<br />
<br />
And I've met people who play the game for all kinds of content. Some are pet battlers, some are LFR players, Mythic Raiders, Gladiator PvP players, Casual PvP players and so on. My perspective is built from my own opinion of the game. That's it really. I don't judge LFR like you do based off a few players I know.</div></div><hr />

I'm a mythic raider - my guild farms 4 mythic ToS bosses (people quit the game, so our progress stopped and we can't transfer, because Blizzard wants us to pay real money for something other games have for free). Do you know how I feel when I see some shitter, who's never seen an inside a mythic ToS running around with a higher ilvl than me, because he was &quot;lucky&quot;? It feels like &quot;why should I even bother&quot;. <br />
<br />
Not to mention I can't seriously tank with my warrior, because I was &quot;unlucky&quot; enough not to drop the bracers yet. <br />
<br />
Blizzard is full of retarded ideas. You remember garrisons and how they DESTROYED the economy? Are you enjoying your crafting professions, like LW, BS and Tailoring? Oh boy do I.<br />

<br />
I've always stated I'm not fond of Titanforging. I mean I wish it would go back to 6 item levels. Titanforging still only offers a chance which means you aren't forced into it. Base item level for each raid is enough to progress. Titanforging is essentially a bonus except they went a bit over the top with it.<br />
<br />
And on the transfer note. Which other MMOs let you transfer for free out of curiosity? ESO uses Megaserver so there isn't a transfer, FF14 costs £12, GW2 is paid and the only free one I know of is Rift but well that game is meh. I'm trying to think of other games but I can't off the top of my head and Rift is the only one that comes to mind.<br />
<br />
And I agree. I wasn't too fond of Garrisons either. Not because of the crafting but because of the Legendary being tied to it a little to try and keep it going. I actually enjoyed the crafting catch up mechanics because I had a lot of lowbie crafters I wanted to level for a while which the Garrison enabled me to do.<br />
<br />
Just the shipyard really frustrated me due to those Legendary missions. And them just rubbing in Farahlon with that stupid pearl item.</div></div><hr />

I'm glad there's some common ground we agree on.<br />
<br />
I count MMOs which use megaservers, because it's Blizzard choice to use the old server technology (even though they are improving the tech with zoning and sharding) and they force the playerbase to pay for.<br />
<br />
Black Desert Online also comes to mind.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The thing is I'd rather have zoning and sharding than a Megaserver. However they seriously need to wake the hell up with Connected Realms. Merging low pops to low pops isn't going to work anymore. Merge low pop PvE ones with Draenor or Silvermoon EU for example and the same for PvP.<br />
<br />
Sharding did it's job and resolved the WoD fiasco with Legion and most issues in general for once.<br />
<br />
Only Megaserver MMO I don't count is ESO. Because it is just one server. There isn't named servers so you can't exactly transfer. Although Megaservers like that are beautiful because you don't have to.</div></div><hr />

and ? world bosses drop free 930 loot and nobody is whining about it - by now if you farmed them you should have at least 4-5 pieces from them - by the time it lands it should be 8+ pieces - yet somehow thats ok <br />
<br />
nobody will do lfr for loot besides very fresh alts.</div></div><hr />

TBC, vanilla and WotLK were great, because seeing a boss was a reward in itself, not a themepark raid you can literally AFK through.<br />
Is it a coincidence that LFR came out at the same time WoW's population started a dive which hasn't stopped since (Cata)? I think not!<br />
<br />
LFR came out in Cata because they killed the normal 10 man raiding that casual players did. Those players quit because there was nothing to do. It also killed a lot of 25 man raids because it was easier to get enough people for 10man which gave the same gear. There were almost no pugs compared to Wrath. People who liked 25 man raids (like me) quit. So raid participation was down and raid development could not be justified without getting people back into raiding. The only real mistake is that they made it too easy. It should have been just slightly less difficult and queuable, sort of like the difference between the current normal and heroic.</div></div><hr />

In that case it can be just normal diffculty raids you can queue as you do for LFR now. Give people a chance to fail. It's a reason to get better at the game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's steadily killing raiding guilds since the day it was created. I've personally known a lot of players who came back to WoW, leveled up to [max_level] and did an LFR or two, then got bored and quit again.<br />
<br />
You need motivation to raid, LFR is the most demotivating tool I've ever seen. TBC, vanilla and WotLK were great, because seeing a boss was a reward in itself, not a themepark raid you can literally AFK through.<br />
Is it a coincidence that LFR came out at the same time WoW's population started a dive which hasn't stopped since (Cata)? I think not!<br />
<br />
And of course the statistics will show that people attend LFR raids. Who wouldn't if there's a chance for legendary items, a way to do without ANY effort your weekly raid quests and get some low level tier sets? The problem is that the &quot;here's a raid and 10 difficulty levels - enjoy!&quot; is a shitty approach, which has been discouraging people who might've been real riders if given a chance and some challenge.<br />
Now WoW became a single-player MMO where you queue do to dungeons, queue to do raids, queue to do pvp not moving an inch from [your_faction's_capital]. But that's another story for another time.<br />
<br />
<br />
Using your logic, no one ever played sports professionally, because they could go down the park and play and with some friends. No one ever painted a masterpiece, because they threw some paint as a child on paper. <br />
<br />
If a persons motivation to play this game is utterly destroyed by the fact they can do something easily, then they weren't that motivated to being with. <br />
<br />
Also, look again at the facts on Cata. LFR came out at the end of cata, long after the losses had truly set in. This was the infamous expansion, where ghost crawler told everyone 'git gud'. Turns out that many, many people were not that interested in wiping in a video game over and over. MoP actually held steady for a substantial portion of time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Except that's wrong.<br />
Post-WotLK Blizzard was never pro-difficulty. Even Cata dungeons were nerfed to the ground after 2 weeks since release, because people came crying about it. I have to ask for source about that &quot;git-gud&quot; attitude, because I don't remember Ghostcrawler saying anything even remotely like that. That was a lot of years ago though, so I might've forgotten.<br />
<br />
Also LFR was implemented with Dragon Soul, so in the Cata timeline it was pretty much in the middle of expansion.<br />
<br />
Also I don't get your sports analogy. You have to use food ones, these are always gold.</div></div><hr />

Then I let it lapse once I finished the storylines and did the dungeon. <br />
<br />
That's what I do. I sub when there's new content added, then I stop subbing once I've finished it to a level in which I'm happy with. If there was no LFR, I'd just resub long enough to do new dungeons and new hubs/storylines, then lapse until there's more.<br />
<br />
(I have no interest in PVP)<br />
<br />
Like, if I resubbed right now, all I'd have to do is repeating content I've already done or doing content, like mythics, which I don't want to do.<br />
<br />
Oh, or level alts, which Legion turned me off of doing until recently. I've leveled a few (I think I have 3 or 4 at 110, though I do have a character of every class at at least 100). Frankly, that's just not mega appealing either.<br />
<br />
Not to come off as rude, but are you sure an MMO like WoW is the right game/genre for you? You seem more like and RPG kind of player?<br />
MMOs are more about the grind to become powerfull than the story, and the story is more a good bonus. That’s atleast how I see it :)<br />

Your attitude towards Blizzard as a whole is sad as hell, and if I didn't know any better I'd recommend that you step away from the game for a few months because it seems to be affecting you quite deeply with the bile that you have spewed in this one post.<br />

Face it, this game is RNG at it's absolute best. And if RNG is what is getting you down, go cancel your sub and get outside. Because you know what's not RNG? Having actual fun.</div></div><hr />

It's allegedly a bad thing for raiding guilds, and probably it can steal a player here and there, but there is absolutely no proof that everybody that is &quot;a lost raider&quot; would actually raid at all if LFR was removed. <br />
<br />
Personally, I just don't have great interest in large scale raids, I've done them now and then but I like to keep it to learning the story from them as I love that. I have no interest in raid loot itemlevels or so, but I do enjoy looking for fashion. I've always been more a 1-5 player person, it feels more entertaining to me in that environment as it typically uses more of each class and each player's actions counts more. Also, I find in general the whole addoncraft to be pretty tiresome. So for me, I'll wait for LFR to do it for story. It's kinda strange to me how long it takes to come out, since Normal mode tends to be so easy as well, but...</div></div><hr />

Your attitude towards Blizzard as a whole is sad as hell, and if I didn't know any better I'd recommend that you step away from the game for a few months because it seems to be affecting you quite deeply with the bile that you have spewed in this one post.<br />
<br />
Face it, this game is RNG at it's absolute best. And if RNG is what is getting you down, go cancel your sub and get outside. Because you know what's not RNG? Having actual fun.<br />
Understanding his position is actually pretty easy. He does the hardest content of a game, so he wants the best rewards for it. Seeing someone else having even better rewards from doing basic content like dungeons or LFR or simple world quests gives him the feeling, there's no point in doing the hardest content since its rewards are not the best. I get his mentality to an extent, it's the need(fun) to compete with others and to surmount them on a certain level. Look for iLevel as a sort of gold medal for his achievement of advancing on mythic mode.<br />
<br />
Every player has different views of WoW and reasons why he plays the game. His reason is as valid as yours. And to him, mythic raiding and the competitive aspect of it is his source of fun in the game. For you, it might be something different. But nonetheless, both sources of fun are valid.<br />
<br />
Actually I agree with his point of hating titanforging. It's a bad system since basically only people doing mythic content (raids and/or high M+ dungeon content) have the need for items with such high item levels. But that's a discussion I'd like to have with the team at Blizzard who made the decision of implementing the titanforge system in the first place.<br />
<br />
Edit. And nope, I don't do mythic raiding. :-)</div></div><hr />

I`m not a mythic raider either, but I agree with him and with you..titanforging is a cancer (and I have a bunch on my main...940/937 ilvl as hc raider and I`m inactive since 1,5 months..inc a 955 gloves from hc ToS...)</div></div><hr />

I wish they'd remove it permanently, so these &quot;raiders&quot; have to actually go and do normals, which are piss-easy to begin with, but can't just afk bosses.<br />
So in other words you want ALL raids removed cause that is what happens when lfr is gone cause people doing lfr &gt; people doing normal + heroic + mythic together.</div></div><hr />

MMOs are more about the grind to become powerfull than the story, and the story is more a good bonus. That’s atleast how I see it :)<br />
In the end though, you do yours, and I do my thing.<br />
<br />
I've been playing WoW since 2006 or so. I enjoy it for what I get out of it. <br />
<br />
That being said, if Blizzard hadn't made platitudes for people like me, I'd probably only resub at the start and end of expansions.<br />
<br />
and actually, character growth is the number one reason why I do play it. I just get bored when I can't grow my character in any meaningful way that doesn't require stringent grouping or whatever. <br />
<br />
I actually like grinding if I get something out of it :(</div></div><hr />

Excellent idea. Those folks seemed very passionate about providing as close to a Vanilla experience as possible. I'd recommend hiring some of them if they are interested.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's steadily killing raiding guilds since the day it was created. I've personally known a lot of players who came back to WoW, leveled up to [max_level] and did an LFR or two, then got bored and quit again.<br />
<br />
You need motivation to raid, LFR is the most demotivating tool I've ever seen. TBC, vanilla and WotLK were great, because seeing a boss was a reward in itself, not a themepark raid you can literally AFK through.<br />
Is it a coincidence that LFR came out at the same time WoW's population started a dive which hasn't stopped since (Cata)? I think not!<br />
<br />
And of course the statistics will show that people attend LFR raids. Who wouldn't if there's a chance for legendary items, a way to do without ANY effort your weekly raid quests and get some low level tier sets? The problem is that the &quot;here's a raid and 10 difficulty levels - enjoy!&quot; is a shitty approach, which has been discouraging people who might've been real riders if given a chance and some challenge.<br />
Now WoW became a single-player MMO where you queue do to dungeons, queue to do raids, queue to do pvp not moving an inch from [your_faction's_capital]. But that's another story for another time.<br />
<br />
Do you raid above normal difficulties? I'm just curious what types of players actually acknowledge the existence of LFR (apart from actual LFR-raiders)</div></div><hr />

Ha, if anything LFR stopped Cata's bleeding. The xpack was already losing people at a rate only matched by WoD, for several reasons, but the biggest one was probably trying to make the game hardcore again after Wrath (such as with difficult Heroics and 10m raiding) so that casual players crashed and burned. If you follow a graph of Cata's lifetime, 4.3 is the patch that slowed the sub descent despite releasing along an infamously terrible raid. <br />
<br />
LFR players are their own thing. Before, they just didn't raid at all. With LFR they see the content. Blizzard try to rid themselves of LFR, by nerfing its rewards to the ground in WoD in the hopes of pushing people into Normal. It did not work at all because LFR-only players do not want the pressure of an organized raid setting. <br />
<br />
I find LFR hate to be absurd. I'm a Mythic raider and it barely affects me at all. Let others have their fun.</div></div><hr />

no wonder blizzard is barely scrapiing any subs and have to release classis to milk some more cash from players.<br />
<br />
If somehow you could coordinate the sub behaviour of ALL LFR players as 1 . And all sub/unsub at the same time ,blizz would be your bitch .<br />
They would do backflips for you guys . Elitist's could never pull this off as there numbers are about 5 % of the total population .Blizz would not care.<br />
You guys on the other hand would rule the game as blizz(as all company's) are driven by pure greed and you guys would be controlling the majority of their wow cash flow . Unite and controll !! Power to the people!! If only .....:rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

Come on dude, you're getting free tier sets for zero challenge. And potentially a chance at gear better than mythic gear. Either join a raiding guild, pug normal, or be patient and appreciate what you get. I know you want it all NOW NOW NOW, but please try and appreciate that (in a non derogatory fashion), you are getting fantastic gear handed to you on a plate, while other people have to put in effort into getting that gear. If you don't want to put into raiding for whatever reason, then you have to be patient and wait, that's the trade off. That's not unreasonable is it? <br />
<br />
It's also for balance, so that you can't farm all of LFR for tier sets and trinkets in the first week.</div></div><hr />

I don't think those OP trinkets actually drop on LFR.<br />
<br />
I checked the LFR loot table and Argus doesn't have them listed. But he does on Normal and higher.</div></div><hr />

Yup, you're right. I forgot they weren't in the LFR. I meant farm for tier sets and trinkets in /general/ rather than this raid specifically as nothings been missing from LFR before now in terms of gear(maybe the legendary ring upgrade token? I forget but pretty sure you needed to do normal at least for that).</div></div><hr />

<br />
To be honest I think a week per wing is more than enough. By 4 weeks a lot of people have Normal on farm, HC on farm or ending progression and higher end guilds progressing through Mythic.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah 2 does feel way unnecessary. I can literally only assume its to stop top end raiders farming it.</div></div><hr />
