Patch 4.2 Hotfixes - June 29<br />
Classes<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/idruids.gif Druid (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/270-Druid) / Talent Calculator (http://www.wowtal.com/#k=..druid) / Skills/Talents (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/1117-Druid-Cataclysm))<br />
<br />
Feral druids can now use Skull Bash in the Firelands raid. It only seems fair.<br />
<br />
<br />
Dungeons &amp; Raids<br />
Baradin Hold<br />
<br />
Eye of Occuâ€™thar damage and health is now properly scaled for 10- and 25-player versions of the dungeon.<br />
<br />
<br />
Blackwing Lair<br />
<br />
All Brood Affliction debuffs applied by Chromaggus are now removed after zoning out of Blackwing Lair.<br />
<br />
<br />
Firelands<br />
<br />
The stationary Hell Hound pack at the front of the dungeon should no longer cause players to become stuck in combat.<br />
There are now fewer Hell Hounds before Bethâ€™tilac, making the engagement a little lessâ€¦ hellish.<br />
Bethâ€™tilac and her offspring now have increased health and damage on Heroic difficulty.<br />
Ragefaceâ€™s Face Rage is now slightly less rageful, as the increase of the rate of damage per tick has been reduced.<br />
Creatures linked to Shannox will now respawn every 4 hours until he is killed, up from 2 hours.<br />
<br />
<br />
Zulâ€™Gurub<br />
<br />
High Priest Venoxis and Zanzil have had the damage of many of their spells and abilities reduced.<br />
<br />
<br />
Items<br />
<br />
Cauldron of Battle and Big Cauldron of Battle no longer lose flask charges from repeated clicks when players already have one in their inventory.<br />
Eternal Embers dropped in the Firelands raid now bind when picked up. Master Looters are only able to give Eternal Embers to players who are on the quest All-Seeing Eye.<br />
Paladin tier 12 2-piece set bonus: It should no longer be possible to get a double proc of Flames of the Faithful.<br />
Many item procs were not being triggered properly by melee auto attacks after a hotfix made yesterday. This has been corrected.<br />
Holiday Rewards<br />
<br />
Satchel of Chilled Goods, Keg-Shaped Treasure Chest, Heart-Shaped Box, and Loot-Filled Pumpkin will no longer remain in character inventory once the associated holiday is over. Players must loot the items from these caches before the corresponding holiday ends. More information can be found here.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
Arenas<br />
<br />
The Ring of Valor<br />
<br />
There is no longer a 6-second delay on the rising of the pillars after the match has begun.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Quests &amp; Creatures<br />
<br />
It is no longer possible to complete some daily quests more than once a day by turning them in during a small window before the standard reset time.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Holiday Bag Hotfix<br />
Weâ€™re going to be applying a hotfix soon to remove holiday-specific bags when the holiday period ends. The specific bags in question are:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Loot-Filled Pumpkin (Hallowâ€™s End)<br />
Keg-Shaped Treasure Chest (Brewfest)<br />
Satchel of Chilled Goods (Midsummer Fire Festival)<br />
Heart-Shaped Box (Love is in the Air)<br />
<br />
<br />
These bags will only exist while their holiday is active, and when the holiday ends they will be removed. This is to resolve an exploit revolving around keeping these bags beyond the holiday period to re-roll their contents.<br />
<br />
Youâ€™ll want to be sure to open and remove the contents of any holiday bags before the holiday ends. If you still have any bags from previous holiday events they'll be removed when this hotfix goes live. <br />
<br />
<br />
Patch 4.2: Featured Items<br />
In addition to the new iLevel 365 gear that players can purchase from unlockable vendors at the Molten Front and the epic armor sets they can claim from Ragnaros and his minions in the Firelands raid, patch 4.2 also boasts a wealth of cool items for collectors and completionists alike.<br />
<br />
From companion pets to mounts to trinkets with unique on-use effects, there's a little something for everyone. To make sure you don't miss out on any of these collectables, we've put together a list of all the new featured items introduced in 4.2 so you can check out what's available and where!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Patch 4.2 Featured Items<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Blue Posts<br />
Patch 4.2 Hairstyles<br />
We did have a lot of new hairstyles we had created over time up on the patch 4.2 Public Test Realms. The problem was that, even though these hairstyles were added on the test realms, many of them were not finalized or approved by our art team. Because of this, a good portion of them (about half) were pulled shortly before patch 4.2 was released on live realms, leaving only a partial implementation of new hairstyle choices.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, this means some races/genders now have more hairstyles than others. This result had nothing to do with intentionally giving some races more choices than others. It was based purely on which hairstyles we felt were ready to go live, and which we felt were not.<br />
<br />
These new hairstyles are also not available at the Character Selection screen and can only be chosen via the Barbershop. We definitely plan on going back over the hairstyles which did not make it into the game and adding them at a later date. <br />
<br />
So the artists approved the new Draenei swim cap, but they didn't feel other styles were good enough? That boggles the mind.<br />
In an ideal world I don't think any of them would have gone live in patch 4.2, as we prefer to release updates like this when everything is ready to go. It wasn't really our intention to throw them all in without letting players know we were adding dozens of new choices, but we ended up only pulling some of them out.

<br />
You don't. If you look, different rep levels have different ilvl.<br />
<br />
And that's also an elemental shaman axe, so a whole 3 specs can use it, up from 2. Man, almost makes me wish I'd stayed with my shaman this expansion, instead of strapping the shield on my warrior.</div></div><hr />

Finally a healing weapon I can get on my Paladin without having to compete with Priests or Druids!<br />

The only thing that has different lv. among the rep reward is the end game ring(391), same as ICC ring, which you can buy only when you're exalted. Any other rep rewards are all 378.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They drop from bosses, so it makes sense that the normal versions drop from normal bosses, and heroic drop from heroic bosses. There's a tab for Normal and Heroic on the info box.<br />
<br />
Not sure what the confusion is, let me know if I answered your thought - was hard to understand. :)</div></div><hr />

I think the eye of occulk or whatever is the new trash you have to kill in BH, not the ability that is part of the boss fight. Granted, this was a full pug, but we wiped twice today on that first new trash pull in BH....<br />
<br />
To make it worse, 30 minutes later I died a horrible tanking death to some spinning turtles.</div></div><hr />

Man, almost makes me wish I'd stayed with my shaman this expansion, instead of strapping the shield on my warrior.His question was basically if the datamined 391 files that still exist on live are actually going to be obtainable. Currently as it stands the only.391.waist upgrades known from.boss drops are 1 dps.plate, 1 dps feral leather and 1 397 cloth. That leaves a LOT of people stuck with 378 waists so yeah Id say it is an important question.One that I really would love to see addressed and hopefully fixed if necessary.</div></div><hr />

Satchel of Chilled Goods, Keg-Shaped Treasure Chest, Heart-Shaped Box, and Loot-Filled Pumpkin will no longer remain in character inventory once the associated holiday is over. Players must loot the items from these caches before the corresponding holiday ends. More information can be found here.<br />
Blizzard are pretty much douchebags... remove the item, THEN announce you're going to remove it. Would've been nice to have like a couple days warning.</div></div><hr />

It is a nerf. But a good one. Me and another Arcane Mage have to get rid of Fage rage from players. But sometimes, if youre unlucky, you dont even get a crit after three casts -&gt; player dead, cause of horrible fast ticking three ticks. :(</div></div><hr />

The turtles aren't actually that bad if you have people to stun interrupt the spins. Works well once you get that down. Makes them trivial.</div></div><hr />

High Priest Venoxis and Zanzil have had the damage of many of their spells and abilities reduced.<br />

Finally, they did this for Venoxis. Just seem like healers can't do anything with that Toxic Link ability.</div></div><hr />

I must have missed it if it is, going through the drops... Wish there was more healer stuff dropped by trash, am I right? One Spell Dagger for a damn Shaman, comin' up! It has crit, so it's kinda for healers too!!! DERP! (Crit at entry level/trash clearing gear levels, or 355-360+ won't need Crit much for Healing, even for us Resto shamans compared to Spirit, of course depending on gear but.. I've found the need for plenty of Spirit for emergencies, like self-rezz etc. Drop MTT, pop Core, and on I go... Crit wouldn't be all that helpful once your oom or close to it :-/ Maybe at later gear levels, like I said...)<br />
