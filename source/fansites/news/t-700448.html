Wee. A minor change, but one that's been annoying me as of late. There's been a handful of occasions on raid bosses where the pet is pretty much out of range, and I have to constantly adjust.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Take for instance the Blood Council. Now, I'm not a Warlock myself, but we generally have our Warlock send his Imp after one Kinetic Bomb, so we don't have to worry about that one.<br />
<br />
Now, if the Warlock is running out of mana, he would then have to run aaaall the way to the imp to get mana, or Life Tap, if he was across the room. Bad things happen.<br />
<br />
Just an example though.<br />
<br />
<br />

Love the lil' XT, and glad to see Discipline Priests won't be left out, or my Sacred Shield \o/</div></div><hr />

Odds are it will be. Just by the sales numbers that can be gathered by the<br />
donation to Make a Wish from previous sales, and Blizzard's statement they <br />
will add more in the store in the future one can pretty much come to that conclusion.<br />
<br />
The Celestial Steed ... possible mount in the store? While I hope it is attainable<br />
with a little work, I don't want to see it be a store item. 310% leads me to think<br />
its either a drop, or another yet to be seen meta achievement like the violet<br />
proto-drake.</div></div><hr />

Not really a buff so much as a correction that allows Disc. Preists to gain the 5% advantage.</div></div><hr />

They ban gold sellers because it is making a profit off of Blizzard's intellectual property.<br />
<br />
It would be like charging your friends $1 every time you send them a gift in one of those Facebook games.<br />

It's not about selling in-game items for real money. It's about selling stuff that doesn't belong to you.</div></div><hr />

Annoying on certain fights when the pet gets out of range, and I have to life tap instead of dark pact. Some fights, I'm at max range, and the pet goes to the other side. Sure, I can hit the boss, but the pet is 1-2 yards outside my range.</div></div><hr />

It might be a new theme of theirs to take popular old bosses and make pets/mounts based on them. Lil KT, Lil XT, Algalon themed mount, all based on popular old bosses. Wouldnt be surprised to See Lil CT(C'thun) Lil YS(Yogg saron) is they stay in that fashion. I'd even pay for a Lil Invincible.</div></div><hr />

Jasyn is correct. Blizzard sells its own products to us the consumer because it is a business. Gold sellers, while being an illegal business, are taking the &quot;toys&quot; from Blizzard's &quot;playground&quot; and profiting from them. That is what's illegal, bud.</div></div><hr />

I know that they're a business which has a fiduciary duty to maximize returns. That being said, part of the appeal of the game to me has always been the absence of micro-transactions. You pay x dollars per month, and that gives you the same opportunity to obtain the same items as everyone else. The gradual transition towards micro-transactions is a worrying trend in my view.</div></div><hr />

You make a good point but the thing is the pet's aren't a super amount of money. They are at a price that if you can afford wow you can afford the pet. And you just know the day they come out everyone and their dog's going to have one :)<br />

<br />
This exactly.<br />
<br />
If they're going to be getting so much more money from these micro transactions then maybe they should follow suit of other online games by removing the monthly fee.<br />
<br />
As if 10 million people paying £8.99 a month isn't enough for Blizzard.<br />
<br />
Funnily enough this kind of thing only started happening about the time a certain Activision muscled their way in...<br />
<br />
I really don't want to see Lil XT in the store. Pets &amp; Mounts should be rewards for quest chains or rep gains in-game, not purchased for a stupid amount like £10.<br />
<br />
Come to think of it, I swear Lil KT &amp; Pandaren Monk were only £6 before. How on earth did they get more expensive? Were there more manufacturing costs involved or something?! Sprites are now subject to major inflation! Oh noes!</div></div><hr />

Right, I mean the pricing is really not my issue. It's the concept of micro-transactions, they undermine the fundamental equity of a subscription based game. Pet collecting used to be one of my hobbies, but I'm not going to pay real money to 'keep up.' I understand it's their company and their game to manage as they see fit. I'm not going to quit over this, nor am I trying to unduly flame Blizzard. The decision does make sense from a business standpoint, at least in the short run. I just think it's a slippery slope and that it undermines (albeit only a little) one of the best aspects of the game.<br />
<br />
In related news, I am going to add up what all the mini-pets cost and then use it to buy Activision stock. That way when I see the mini-pets in game I won't be jealous, I'll just /wave and say 'thanks for increasing my returns!'<br />

It's actually funny that people buy ingame pets from Blizzard with real money but their accounts are technically still property of Blizzard. You can't sell them eventhough you bought it from them.</div></div><hr />

20 energy on feint-20 energy=free feint<br />
<br />
net gain=20 energy<br />
<br />
the 2 piece set bonus from tier 10 is 30 energy (15 gained and 15 saved) every what? 30 seconds?<br />

if you have no other rogues to trade tools with, the feint glyph is fantastic.i will put it on one of my 2 specs for sure.</div></div><hr />

20 energy is less worth then 15% more damage for 4s. and in which fight do you use feint on cooldown while tot you should use always on cooldown no matter if it costs energy or not since it makes sense to tot any dps class no matter if its a rogue or not. that means even in fights where you should feint on cooldown(is there any one?) it doesnt makes sense and in addition in most cases the healing is good enough to ignore feint completely and do damage instead. in pvp there are by far better glyphs noone rated higher then 900 would even think about using this glyph.</div></div><hr />

Except follow-pets don't affect game play in any way. They're simply cure little screen artifacts that some people like to collect. If they start selling gold/enchants/gear/special abilities for real money, then I'm all with you. Even more to the point they've been doing this for years (really since day one), it's just a more direct transaction now. Buy a limited edition game box? Get a &quot;free&quot; pet (for $20 or so). Spend $20 to get the Blizzcon Pay-per-Veiw? Get a &quot;free&quot; pet. Buy WoW TCG? Get loot cards, including &quot;free&quot; pets. This is just saying, &quot;you know what, people love these little digital screw balls, why don't we just sell them direct instead of all this indirect silliness&quot;.</div></div><hr />
