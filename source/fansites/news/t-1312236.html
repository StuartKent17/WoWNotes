Casting While Moving<br />
I think the concept largely stems from the idea that casting a spell takes an extreme amount of concentration. Imagine, for example, a chef preparing a meal and chopping up a bunch of potatoes or something. Now imagine him doing it at a brisk jog. Somehow that seems... unsafe, at best.<br />
<br />
Obviously there are gameplay reasons why a spell would be castable while moving, but even then, one could argue that part of the &quot;strength&quot; of that spell is the ability to do so. Maybe a Lightning Bolt is fairly easy for a Shaman to cast while standing still, but it takes a lot of focus to be able to fire one off while running.

Patch 5.4 Holy Paladin Changes<br />
Hi there Jmax, I'm here with more information from our developers to provide more context behind some of the recent changes to Holy Paladins on the 5.4 PTR.<br />
<br />
Intent behind the Eternal Flame change<br />
<br />
We’ve made some changes to Eternal Flame because we feel the talent was being overrepresented within the Holy Paladin population.<br />
<br />
Our intent for was for Holy Paladins to pick Selfless Healer if they like to Judge, Eternal Flame if they like heal-over-time spells, and Sacred Shield if they liked damage absorb shields. As it worked out, most every Holy paladin chose Eternal Flame, and we don’t want every Holy paladin to be a heal-over-time machine. (That’s a niche best served by Restoration Druids and Holy Priests.)<br />
<br />
We don’t think Holy Paladin’s healing throughput is too high overall (though we’ll gather more information from testing on the 5.4 PTR), so our intent is not to nerf but to reduce reliance on Eternal Flame. One of the biggest problem with Eternal Flame is the way it interacts with the Illuminated Healing mastery, which turns the heal-over-time spell into a potent shield as well. If needed, we will compensate by buffing healing elsewhere.<br />
<br />
Our plans for now, are to revert the nerf that was done to the initial healing component of Eternal Flame, but we are unlikely to change the Illuminated Healing back to the way it was. <br />
<br />
Sacred Shield<br />
<br />
Regarding Sacred Shield, we tried giving the talent as a baseline ability to Protection, but we’re unhappy with that experiment and are likely to revert the change. We agree that the current (old) version of Sacred Shield is more attractive to Holy than the (new) version. We also would likely have to nerf Protection to compensate for getting Holy Shield in addition to another talent. Overall, we think the current (old) version of Sacred Shield is a better design. Perhaps we can still make Sacred Shield more attractive for Holy and Retribution, and make the other two talents (Selfless Healer, Eternal Flame) more attractive to Protection. <br />
<br />
Our goal<br />
<br />
We understand that Selfless Healer requires a certain playstyle that not every Holy paladin will find attractive. So we want to make Eternal Flame and Sacred Shield feel like viable talent choices as well.<br />
<br />
Mastery not benefiting from Execution Sentence or Light’s Hammer isn’t intended and probably just got caught in the change to make Eternal Flame’s heal-over-time not benefit with mastery. We will correct that.<br />
<br />
Remember, at this early stage in the PTR, our designers’ focus are on implementation changes (mechanics) first, and tuning changes (numbers) later. Your feedback at this stage will be more helpful to be focusing on the mechanics (e.g. “I liked using hots” or “I like to Judge and wish I could use Selfless Healer more”) and less on “OMG 30% nerf.” (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/262957-54-holy-paladin-opinions-feedback-and-ideas/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/9344634569?page=1#2))<br />

Patch 5.4 Kil'Jaeden's Cunning Update<br />
There's been a lot of discussion on the topic of Kil'Jaeden's Cunning in 5.4 but we've got some new info, and since that thread is growing rather large I think it's best to start up a new one.<br />
<br />
We've been following all of your feedback very closely, and we're going to try a different approach to Kil'Jaeden's Cunning in 5.4.<br />
<br />
In a future PTR build, Kil'Jaeden's Cunning will once again be a passive effect. Selecting it will allow the Warlock to cast Malefic Grasp, Shadow Bolt, and Incinerate while moving. There is no penalty, so you'll be able to move at full speed.<br />
<br />
We still feel that the 5.3 version of Kil'Jaeden's Cunning isn't working out, but we don't want to &quot;nerf fun&quot; either. It's clear that many Warlocks simply enjoy the feel of being able to cast on the move, and we'd like to be able to preserve as much of that feeling if possible.<br />
<br />
With this change, we can make the &quot;penalty&quot; of taking KJC that you don't have Mannoroth's Fury or Archimonde's Vengeance, which should result in more damage output in cases where movement is less critical (and we're working on some changes to Archimonde's Vengeance that should help with that). We're also still planning on buffing Fel Flame in a way that helps lower the impact to mobility caused by choosing one of those talents over Kil'Jaeden's Cunning, without nerfing it for PvP purposes.<br />
<br />
Remember, we're still extremely early in the PTR process. There will be many more changes to the game before the patch goes live.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the update. So just to be clear, Mannoroth's Fury is still on track to be 10 secs up, 60 sec CD with the increase to range and damage? <br />
Yes. Again, PTR is PTR and anything can change, but we do like how the new Mannoroth's Fury makes it a clear DPS boost in AoE situations.

<br />
<br />
Patch 5.4 Pet Battle PvP Timer Changes<br />
We have received feedback where players said that their opponent ran out the whole 30 seconds every turn, which made him wait too long in the battle. Therefore, we are ready to add a new feature in Patch 5.4: In a PvP pet battle, if one side doesn't take action within 15 seconds, the system will reduce the time that player can use in the next turn as a penalty. This change is intended to accelerate the pet battle and make it more compact.<br />
<br />
Currently, the system works as follows (numbers below are subject to change):<br />
<br />
Each side has 30 seconds for each turn in the initial state, but if one side doesn't do anything in one turn within 15 seconds, then the time that player can use in the next turn will be reduced by (time used in the last turn - 15) / 2 seconds and the total time that player can use in all turns will be reduced by (time used in the last turn - 15) / 10 seconds.<br />
<br />
For example:<br />
<br />
If one player uses 25 seconds in one turn, then the time that player can use in the next turn will be reduced by (25 - 15) / 2 = 5 seconds, which only affects the next turn. The total time that player can use in all turns will be reduced by (25 - 15) / 10 = 1 second, which affects the whole battle and stacks, but it will reduce the time that can be used in one turn by 15 seconds at most. Therefore, he has 29 - 5 = 24 seconds to decide in the next turn.<br />

Uhm.... Realising that storming a fortified city, filled with soldiers and unknown horrors, and talking about the fact that you might end up with a lot of casualties - isn't &quot;crap&quot;, it's basically common sense.<br />

Garrosh never betrayed cairne, Garrosh respected him and was upset when he found out magatha had made him cheat, after he found out about her plot he refused to send her any reinforcements which she desperately needed in order to keep control of thunderbluff from the rebels. If he had sent her more guards baine wouldn't have been able to retake thunderbluff.<br />

If garrosh didn't respect cairne, he would have sent magatha more troops, she would be the leader of thunderbluff and garrosh would have the support of the taurens rather than them being in the rebellion.</div></div><hr />

It is rubbish. All of a sudden Garrosh betrayed Cairne. Last time I checked, Garrosh duelled him and Magatha Grimtotem betrayed them both. Furthermore, both Vol'jin and Baine know this fact, so their conversation makes no fucking sense.</div></div><hr />

If that's true, then they seriously need to reconsider Normal raids and especially heroic raids and bring them down to the quality and difficulty of LFR, because it's more &quot;fun&quot;, meaning you don't get penalized for not caring about the game you're playing, or the people you're wasting the time of. Or remove them both and leave LFR as the only means of raiding, because of one comic on the internet :p</div></div><hr />

Ofc majority if not every single holy pala is taking Eternal flame cause it increases healing on meters. Nerfing EF will not change players minds on what talent to take in PVE cause the others are just bad for throughput even tho they can be livesavers.

Blizzards continual effort to have all hunters reroll mage. They better have some compensation for these nerfs is all I'm thinking. I've been all but driven outta 25 man hm raiding already and they keep nerfing us. I don't see why hunter as a pure dps class has to be middle of the pack and have so little to offer as we do. I have no problem losing the crappy interupt or the change to Stampede since they at least gave us some sustained dmg boost there.Though We need some Pve Dmg buffs not nerfs, be it minor or at all. Seems like they want to keep going until we hit rock bottom though imo. World of Magecraft.</div></div><hr />

Tired of people hating on Garrosh and thinking it's cool to do so. Garrosh is a tragic hero, this expansion's Macbeth.<br />
<br />
Hardly. Garrosh &quot;doing nothing&quot; isn't a very good declaration of support, and it doesn't make up for all the other crap he's done. He's racist against some races within the Horde, he's shorted the goblins on payments (big mistake), he used excessive force on Theramore. At a time where perhaps peace could have existed between the Horde and the Alliance, Garrosh's pride got in the way (Sha of Pride a coincidence? don't think so). He defiled the Vale of Eternal Blossoms, and with it, the Pandaren's trust of the Horde. He has betrayed Thrall and the very concept of the Horde. &quot;Only the strong may dwell in Orgrimmar&quot;, and then he threw the trolls out.<br />
<br />
Garrosh wants to use blood magic to create an army (Dagger in the Dark scenario) which is viewed as morally corrupt. Don't forget the fact that he tried to have Vol'jin killed.<br />
<br />
If you see Garrosh as some sort of tragic hero simply because he chose to do nothing in regards to Magatha, then I'm sorry but you're blind. *Doing nothing* isn't the same as aiding Cairne. Simply put, Garrosh needs to die.</div></div><hr />

I'm right now stuck at the legendary Furorion fight with an ilevel of 520...as a shadow priest it is just hell cause you have almost no spells you can cast while moving...you have no initial burst and no spamable instant aoes. As a result the blobs are near impossible(unless you get extremely lucky or outgear the fight by having 20 ilevel more than other classes need).<br />
I mean, diversity is nice...but can anyone create a fight where the shadow beats everyone else by 20 ilevel? I don't think so. So you already get a serious and permanent disadvantage build into your class(slow start, no instants, no fast aoe, no serious damage while moving)...and that's crap. <br />
It's nice to be able to dot, but to benefit from that you need the ability to kite the enemies and it doesn't make much sense if you have to stand still to cast those dots then cause during that time the enemy gets you.</div></div><hr />

I guess my concern is the green fire boss of which porting to drop threat is a documented mechanic (not yet tried myself) and if they do jump to 60 will it make the encounter harder?<br />

<br />
I imagine if you roll Mage you would also be sat out.<br />
<br />
I have no evidence to back these claims up - but I'm willing to bet that I am right.<br />
<br />
You have no evidence whatsoever to support a negative attack on a person's gaming skills, yet you &quot;bet&quot; that your claim is right. Well if that's not the textbook definition of an illogical ad hominem right there....<br />
<br />
PS: the guy is right. Hunters have to work twice as hard (read as: too many buttons and choppy priority system) to do the mediocre kind of dps that shamans were doing, right before shaman got buffed. Locks are still on top, Mages are nigh untouchable, and rogues were buffed too. Hunter remains the only pure dps class to be doing, AS A STATISTICAL AGGREGATE AVERAGE, less dps than a hybrid class.</div></div><hr />

Unless your 13/13 hm in 25 man as a hunter don't talk to me about skill buddy. Go ahead and explain to me now what benefit bringing more than one hunter to a 25 man at the moment would be ? Could you imagine it not being a matter of being sat but a realization that I could easily reroll and be more of a benefit to the team playing a different class ? I still play my hunter in Hm ToT yes but have chosen to in 10 man wiht a group missing the attack speed buff (hyena pet). While my mage in half her gear does miles better dps in 25 mans. PS: I have no more evidence other than your Armory profile of the posting character of yours but it appears you have a grand total of zero boss kills within ToT let alone 25 man Hm's.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ever heard of perspective?<br />
Is it not at all possible that Baine BELIEVES Garrosh betrayed Cairne, regardless of if he did or not?</div></div><hr />

This SS is a brand new Talent, the only thing that is the same is the Name, Holy Shield = (old) Sacred shield, as an ability for &quot;Prot&quot; Pallies, now if you are a non-Protadin, I understand your gripe, but as prot this is win win.<br />

Warrior BUFFS?!?!?!?<br />
<br />
Riptose for Warriors can be awesome, but this ability alone will complete change the best stat weights for Prot Warriors, making pure avoidance 2nd to Stam again. There are a few things to weigh out though, if Hit and Exp is completely ignored then you have to worry about unstable resource gains for our active mitigation abilities. I'd like to see this tested out.</div></div><hr />

Pretty much just a nerf without buffs to offset and severely reduces the skill it takes to play a hunter. Give readiness back to MM and leave it alone. It was never a problem before and very fun to double up your big abilities that had any CD. And explosive trap pretty much guarantees a lock and load proc, maybe even two while black arrow is less reliable but does more damage in non-aoe situations. BA also needs a buff now.<br />
<br />
The Dark Legacy was awesome and sort of sad. When you realize that someone is having fun and you arent its never good.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Truefax</div><div class="date">2013-06-22, 02:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Why are you nerfing Conductivity?<br />
<br />
Shaman (Forums / Skills / Talent Calculator)<br />
<br />
Talents<br />
Conductivity has been redesigned. Casting Healing Wave, Greater Healing Wave, Healing Surge, or Chain Heal, increases the duration of Healing Rain by 1 second. Damaging an enemy with Lightning Bolt, Chain Lightning, Earthshock, or Stormstrike increases the duration of Healing Rain by 1 second.<br />
<br />
Why is this being changed? It's a situational and powerful aoe healing ability for elemental and enhance as it is right now:<br />
<br />
When you cast Healing Wave, Greater Healing Wave, or Healing Surge, allies within your Healing Rain share healing equal to 30% of the initial healing done.<br />
<br />
If your Lightning Bolt, Chain Lightning, Earth Shock, or Stormstrike damages an enemy, allies within your Healing Rain share healing equal to 50% of the initial damage done.<br />
<br />
Leave it alone! Extend the duration of healing rain? it's about to go from situational to NEVER being selected as a talent. Especially with the buff to healing tide you're planning (which is actually not even a buff, since you are nerfing purification to only apply to healing stream totem).</div></div><hr />

Blizzard then nerfs a class to the ground in PVE. We put a man on the moon in 1969 but here it is 2013 and we can't balance classes in world of warcraft without rendering them useless still el oh el?<br />
<br />
We also can't put a man on the moon.</div></div><hr />

But I have to work for it, and give it my all. If they nerf readiness to the ground like they are in this beta build, that will mean no matter how hard I work, I won't be able to stay anywhere near the top dps's in the next patch. They better buff other abilities or hunters might as well find something else to do than raiding during next patch.</div></div><hr />
