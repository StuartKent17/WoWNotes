Patch 6.0 - Raid Size Changes<br />
Watcher shared (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/430449981032386560) some information about Patch 6.0 raid size changes today on Twitter!<br />

Patch 5.4.7 - Charge and Warbringer Changes<br />
The latest PTR build removed the stun from Charge (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/100/#17807-17841) and added it to the Warbringer talent. It looks like the next build will revert this change and instead make Pummel (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/6552-pummel) and Disrupting Shout (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/102060-disrupting-shout) have a shared cooldown.<br />
We're going to revert the Charge and Warbringer changes from the 5.4.7 PTR and make a different change. Here's some context:<br />
<br />
We feel that Warriors are too disruptive vs casters in PvP at the moment. To a certain extent it's intended that it should be more difficult to get casts off if there's a melee DPS sticking to you, but Warriors just have too many options along those lines currently. That's part of the thinking behind the change to Charge: as a root, Charge would not interrupt casting, so it would be useful purely as a gap closer and rage generator, not as a way to lock down a caster.<br />
<br />
We're reverting it because, although we do think it's a good change and something we're likely to revisit in the future, it's a bit too big of an overall change for 5.4.7. There's a bit of a ripple effect here; making Charge a root certainly accomplishes the goal of scaling back Warrior interrupts, but it opens up some secondary issues (such as &quot;what happens when you Charge a target with Hand of Freedom active?&quot;) that we'd need some additional time to clear up. Put another way, we wanted to nerf Warriors' ability to disrupt casters, not their mobility, and at this point in time the Charge change would have been a nerf to both.<br />
<br />
So instead, we're making a different change: Pummel and Disrupting Shout will have a 15-second shared cooldown. To be clear: Disrupting Shout will remain at its current 40 second cooldown, but you won't be able to use it within 15 seconds of using Pummel. Likewise, using Disrupting Shout will put Pummel on cooldown.<br />
<br />
We may still come back to the Charge change in Warlords, where all sorts of other changes will have happened (especially to CC) that allow it to make more sense, and we can spend more development and testing time on making sure it doesn't have any unwanted side effects. For now, the shared cooldown on Pummel and Disrupting Shout will fill our original intention of making Warriors just slightly less difficult to cast against.<br />
<br />

<br />
Disrupting Shout and Pummel now both share a 15-second cooldown when either ability is used. Disrupting Shout's 40-second cooldown remains unchanged but the ability will be unavailable for 15 seconds after using Pummel.<br />
Charge now pins a target to the ground, rooting the target (used to stun the target) for 1.5 seconds and generates 20 Rage.<br />
<br />
Talents<br />
<br />
Warbringer now causes Charge to stun the target (used to cause Charge to root a target) for 3 seconds, reducing movement speed by 50% for 15 seconds, and generates 20 Rage.<br />

the plan is to not significantly alter existing animation, just polish - so yes that will remain the same (artofcgrobinson (https://twitter.com/artofcgrobinson/status/426046290011516928))<br />

<br />
PvP<br />
So as MMO-C showed alliance won 84.9% of IoC last month, could that be because of bad map balance? (Too me it feels like it).<br />
there was a bug in 5.3 where alliance could leave the starting area early &amp; ally HK farming groups focus on IoC. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/425846950848503809))<br />
<br />
The problem is faction imbalance and no efforts made to address it. I pvp as ally for near insta-q's (0-2 min).<br />
Certainly. But faction balance has fluctuated over the games lifetime. One popular guild moves and many follow. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/425839256632713216))<br />
<br />
Misc<br />
itâ€™s the perception of mandatory spend versus optional that makes the difference. I.e. Pay 2 compete = bad! pay for cool pet = good<br />
The qualifier &quot;optional&quot; isn't sufficient. It's subjective on what optional means &amp; often the option is wait longer or play more. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/425070236958588929))<br />

<br />
Yea, we can agree on no beta news is bad and generally lack of substantial WoD news. The rest is pretty subjective, I think that new player models looks amazing so far and I couldn't care less about store mounts.<br />
<br />
The raid change thing will be weird though, but I guess everybody that has a chance of clearing HC will have done so by the time we see the pre-WoD patch. So the impact shouldn't be too big.</div></div><hr />

I thought the orcs were a nice update, detailed but still representative of the old model we know and love, though I heard some didn't care for the female human's curves or something to that effect.<br />
<br />
My biggest issue with the new model system is the lack of distinct faces. Pandaren are all the same, just different colored fur. Hopefully this will be harder to get away with with more human-looking races such as, well, humans. We need more wrinkles, scars, and different shaped faces, and fewer happy panda grins (http://i284.photobucket.com/albums/ll24/catti29/pandarenheadoutlines.png).</div></div><hr />

<br />
The real reason is that in this meta-game, nerfing Charge like that would completely ruin Warriors. Once the meta-shifts because of the removal of a lot of the CC in WoD, -then-, they can nerf Charge without any large repercussions.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dwarvenpanzer9</div><div class="date">2014-02-04, 05:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Warrior Changes......Again...All this PVP garbage does is screw up PVE.<br />
<br />
If you want to fix things for PVP, make it so PVE is unaffected. I am sick of everyone bitching and whining about &quot;ZOMG pvp is so unbalanced, Blizz! Fix this now&quot;, and then all the changes Blizz is coerced into making end up altering PVE.<br />
Now you're screwing with warriors being able to properly stun and/or interrupt adds in a raid with any relative usefulness...<br />
<br />
Case in point:<br />
1) Removing the stun from Charge now makes it damn near useless in a raid if an add needs to be stunned (i.e. Dragonmaw Bonecrushers on Galakras if they are hitting someone with Fracture)<br />
2) Changing how the interrupts work by putting them on a shared CD now makes it impossible to keep up a decent interrupt sequence if you happen to be the only one available to do so:<br />
example(s) from both current and prior raids, because the situation has presented itself multiple times, and most assuredly will again: <br />
Fallen Protectors - Embodied Gloom - I'm usually the one to get on him after Sorrow dies, and then I'll hit Pummel, then hit Disrupting Shout, then Pummel is back up for the last one as it's dying (the tank may take one interrupt, but this change screws over the whole dynamic)<br />
Spirit Kings - Zian - Same situation as FP, where having the multiple interrupts at least allows for being able to fill in gaps in the interrupt rotation when needed in addition to Pummel due to, you guessed it, them being on proper *separate* CDs<br />
Galakras - Dragonmaw Bonecrushers - Already mentioned, but noting it again...Rooting them will not break a Fracture.<br />
Sha of Pride - Manifestation of Pride - Interrupting Mocking Blast might not be all that necessary, if ranged burns it down fast enough, but the fact that the ability to properly do so twice on the add if needed will be removed is now a hindrance that should not be coming to pass in PVE...<br />
<br />
I could come up with more examples, but I don't feel like typing them all, since my point is made...<br />
<br />
TL;DR - Stop changing PVE just cause you want to make changes to PVP. You have already made trinkets and other such items function differently if used in Battlegrounds (the trinkets from the Shado-Pan Assault, and the iLvl squish of any gear past a certain threshold)... If you're going to change how abilities function in PVP, make it so they stay the same for raids, because this is getting bloody ridiculous.</div></div><hr />

Honestly I think they are using MoP as a quasi-beta right now, testing new ideas and implimenting them now. Which I think is very good.<br />

<br />
Yeah... please excuse my being blunt but your complaints and arguments are laughable.<br />
<br />
Yes, I understand that for bonecrushers on Galakras, the stun from your charge is very good utility.<br />
But consider this:<br />
a) more likely than not, if you've got the group positioned correctly, the fixate will target a friendly npc that is already right beside you<br />
b) you should already be in melee range if you're dpsing and doing your job<br />
c) You're one of 9 or 24 other people, you have healers that can stun without losing dps, tanks that can stun with a global, not losing positioning of adds<br />
<br />
The same goes for silence. If you don't have a ranged player that can't reliably silence, then there is something wrong with your raid even before the warrior nerfs. Firstly, everyone should already be on the Embodied Gloom. Secondly, disrupting shout is on gcd. If you don't have other melee or ranged that can be thrown into the interrupt rotation you really have no business raiding on heroic, as on normal, a silence hardly matters.<br />
<br />
My point being, these changes are not problematic in the least bit as far as pve is concerned. The changes for pvp make a lot of sense seeing as warriors are already unpeelable and do 70k damage per global.</div></div><hr />

6.0 will be the transition patch - all the core/class changes from the new expansion, with out any of the content. Normally lasts a few weeks to a month.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Deliverer</div><div class="date">2014-02-04, 08:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So basically every other tank have 2 interrupts right now..<br />
Paladins have avenger shield, which can proc, and the regular 15 sec cd interruption<br />
Dks have strangulate and the 15 sec regular interruption <br />
As far as I know Druids got also 2 interruptions.<br />
Not sure about monk. <br />
So now warrior is left with only 1 interruption. <br />
<br />
This is the use I have in siege of my double interruption:<br />
Fallen protectors: group up the gloom with he and the other add, double interrupt on sun<br />
Norushen: adds interruption<br />
Galakras:double interruption on shammies <br />
General nazgrim: interrupt the caster add<br />
Spoils: gather and move the caster add on mogu side <br />
Garrosh: Mc'ed people and adds inside the transition phase<br />
<br />
And let's not talk about challenge modes and dungeon a in general in which basically every single trash pack need interruptions.<br />
<br />
I can understand if you are trying to nerf warrior in pvp against caster, I actually pvp aswell as pve and I personally think casters have really hard times with us but this is also a huge nerf to pve.. I can't count how many times I mass interrupted on my warrior in this xpack and it has become a core ability as tank to be able to double interrupt in raids as well as in challenge mode. This change SHOULD NOT affect pve.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, I understand that for bonecrushers on Galakras, the stun from your charge is very good utility.<br />
But consider this:<br />
a) more likely than not, if you've got the group positioned correctly, the fixate will target a friendly npc that is already right beside you<br />
b) you should already be in melee range if you're dpsing and doing your job<br />
c) You're one of 9 or 24 other people, you have healers that can stun without losing dps, tanks that can stun with a global, not losing positioning of adds<br />
<br />
The same goes for silence. If you don't have a ranged player that can't reliably silence, then there is something wrong with your raid even before the warrior nerfs.

You realise Mythic is just what we currently call Heroic right?<br />
<br />
When 6.0 lands, Flex will be called &quot;Normal&quot;, and what is currently Normal will be called &quot;Heroic&quot; and what is currently heroic will be called &quot;Mythic&quot;, with appropriate raid size changes and flex options. They aren't making a new difficulty or remaking any fights or anything like that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Mythic is 20 man heroic. In WoD they expect you to have every class.<br />
Normal will be fleixible in size, where as now it's only 10 or 25.<br />
<br />
This will mean that current heroic teams must adapt to the size difference.<br />
<br />
This is not simply a name change. This is step one in the two step process.<br />
<br />
Step One: Get heroic to 20-man size. This will buy people time to figure out how they want groups for WoD raiding.<br />
Step Two: Release WoD raid where they expect you to have every class and be prepared for new challenges.<br />
<br />
I would suspect they want to break this apart in to two steps, using SoO, because going straight in to the new challenges with your new group may prove frustrating. With SoO they can expect most mythics to have a full understanding of at least SoO reg full clear and at least a few heroic downs. This gives people more of a chance to feel the *group* first without worrying about new mechanics, yet.<br />
<br />
So to the person who said &quot;you realize mythic is just heroic&quot; -- I believe you are wrong.</div></div><hr />

<br />
While I can understand your desire for more features, wouldn't you say it's a bit &quot;real life&quot; that humans naturally have distinctive facial features, and pandas generally all look the same? What I mean to say is that when you go to the zoo and you see pandas, the average human probably couldn't tell apart one from the other. What kind of features would you want to see a panda have that wouldn't too-far remove them from their real-life adaptations? <br />
<br />
The problem, specifically, is that pandas aren't on the same classification level as humans. Pandas are a sub-type of bears. If WoW had introduced &quot;bears&quot; as the race and then allowed you to customize your bear to look like a panda or a black bear -- similar to how you choose human as your race and then can choose to customize skin color, facial features, hair, etc -- maybe then we'd have more available options to customize your &quot;bear&quot;. Unfortunately though, because we're limited to &quot;panda only&quot; features, they are mostly going to look the same.</div></div><hr />

It's also a problem of what counts as a different feature. Humans and pandaren, once you strip away all the textures, both have exactly one face with other stuff drawn on. But for Pandaren, people think different fur patterns don't count as different faces, but wrinkled vs smooth skin on humans does, when both are just painted on to the same face.<br />
<br />
It's one of the things that made the whole &quot;fem pandas have only one face!&quot; thing so rediculous. Everyone has one face with different stuff drawn on.</div></div><hr />

I'll bet that over 3/4 of them were bought by resellers to put them up on Ebay, as the current going ebay price is around $150-$200. Blizzard should just flood the market with them to avoid all the resellers picking them up.</div></div><hr />

You do realise that Pummel and DShout don't interrupt Fracture? The only option would be Shockwave which has an abysmally long cooldown if used just for rupting fracture. But sure...we warriors are spoiled...never seen a more uninformed post.<br />

<br />
It's lot easier to design PvE for an existing set of abilities, so that every class gets a chance to shine, than it is to start by designing cool PvE skills and end up with a good PvP balance without the need to tweak those skills endlessly. And not only is it easier, but it's also less intrusive when you can later on balance PvE on the encounter level (e.g more aoe fights), instead of nerfing player characters directly.</div></div><hr />
