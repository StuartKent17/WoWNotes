Message from Mike Morhaime<br />
Everyone,<br />
<br />
We announced today that we’re in the process of cutting a number of active positions, mostly non-development, throughout the company. I'm sure this announcement has sparked some questions from all of you, so I want take this opportunity to address those as best I can. Over the past several years, the company has grown rapidly and evolved to better serve you and the rest of our global community. Thanks to all of your support, we continue to serve by far the biggest subscription-based MMO community, as well as the most passionate eSports and online gaming communities, in the world.<br />
<br />
In order to keep making epic game content while serving players effectively, we have to be smart about how we manage our resources. This means we sometimes have to make difficult decisions about how to best maintain the health of the company. We’re in the process of making some of those hard decisions now.<br />
<br />
After evaluating our current organizational needs, we determined that while some areas of our business had been operating at the right levels and could benefit from further growth, other areas had become overstaffed. As a result, we need to scale down some of our departments and part with some of our colleagues and friends here at Blizzard. I know that you all understand how difficult this type of situation can be for anyone who might be affected, so I want to assure you that we'll be offering each impacted employee a severance package and other benefits.<br />
<br />
I also want to emphasize that we remain committed to shipping multiple games this year, and that our development teams in particular remain largely unaffected by today's announcement. We're continuing to develop, iterate, and polish Blizzard DOTA, Diablo III, StarCraft II: Heart of the Swarm, World of Warcraft: Mists of Pandaria, as well as other, unannounced projects. We'll have exciting news to share in the coming weeks regarding Diablo III's release date, and will soon be holding a private media event to showcase the latest work on Mists of Pandaria. It goes without saying that we're working hard to get all of these games in your hands as soon as possible.<br />
<br />
You've all come to expect Blizzard to live up to our mission statement with every game, and deliver the most epic entertainment experiences ever. You can continue to expect that and nothing less from us as we move forward.<br />
<br />

Press release on BusinessWire (http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20120229005855/en/Blizzard-Entertainment-Announces-Staff-Reductions)<br />
IRVINE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Blizzard Entertainment, Inc. today announced that it has conducted a review of its business based on current organizational needs. Following a completion of the review, the company is conducting a global reduction in workforce of approximately 600 employees. The company anticipates approximately 90% of the affected employees will come from departments not related to game development. The World of Warcraft® development team will not be impacted.<br />
<br />
“Constant evaluation of teams and processes is necessary for the long-term health of any business. Over the last several years, we've grown our organization tremendously and made large investments in our infrastructure in order to better serve our global community. However, as Blizzard and the industry have evolved we've also had to make some difficult decisions in order to address the changing needs of our company,” said Mike Morhaime, CEO and cofounder of Blizzard Entertainment. “Knowing that, it still does not make letting go of some of our team members any easier. We’re grateful to have had the opportunity to work with the people impacted by today’s announcement, we’re proud of the contributions they made here at Blizzard, and we wish them well as they move forward.”<br />
<br />
Blizzard's current development and publishing schedules will not be impacted. The company will announce specific release plans for Diablo® III in the near future, and it’s continuing to drive aggressively toward beta testing for World of Warcraft: Mists of Pandaria™, Blizzard DOTA, and StarCraft® II: Heart of the Swarm™. Blizzard also remains committed to maintaining its high standards of quality for customer service delivery. In addition, Blizzard is still recruiting and looking to hire qualified developers for a number of open positions. Further details are available at http://jobs.blizzard.com.<br />
<br />
For press inquiries, please contact Lisa Jensen in Blizzard Entertainment public relations at ljensen@blizzard.com.<br />
<br />
The accounting charges associated with Blizzard's reduction in workforce are not anticipated to be material to Activision Blizzard, Inc. and were included in the 2012 financial outlook that was provided on February 9, 2012.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Blizzard employs thousands of employees, including legal teams, art assets, a large in-house music team (largely unheard of in this industry), a massive in-house legal team, web designers, etc. etc. etc. <br />
<br />
Not only is Blizzard treating them right with a great severance package, but they are giving great recommendations to these people as they look for other jobs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Like any company, they're looking to improve the profits they make. It isn't always a case of &quot;They make 123012031023 per year, of course they can afford it!&quot; it's a case of making as much profit as they can, and without knowing for certain, this is probably them doing just that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Its not remotely about whether they CAN support such a staff. Its about whether they need it.<br />
<br />
Certainly this is further evidence of the company dying in some non-specific, and catastrophic fashion, and not something that successful businesses do all the time! [/sarcasm]</div></div><hr />

I'm sure the official Blizzard forums are teeming with the most experienced players that also have the most open minds about changes and content iterations.<br />
<br />
And I guess I'm wrong for enjoying the game then. And for being excited about Mists.</div></div><hr />

I beg to differ. They make a tonne of money from the cash-shop, and our Sub basically goes towards paying salaries as the cost of servers is no where near as great as it was when the game first started.</div></div><hr />

Yep, it sure is. Some states have laws that more closely regulate that sort of thing than others. But, as Mike said, they're getting a severance package that will hopefully tide them over until they get a new job... and having Blizzard Entertainment on your resume wouldn't make finding a new job too difficult I shouldn't think.

Yeah, resource management is a nice explanation for firing people and no longer making good raids.<br />
<br />
I picked these two posts out in the hope that future comments could engage their brain longer than these guys did. Blizzard is more than the people that develop raids or even WoW and simplifying things like this down to &quot;Hurr Blizzard just wants to save 100k a year because they're greedy&quot; is being clueless.<br />
<br />
He gave no information about who was being cut. For all we know they're rearranging teams and wanted to reduce hierarchy by losing managers. Maybe they're centralising certain accounting or management and no longer need project specific staff. Until details are given any assumptions are exactly that: assumptions.<br />

In practice people are also fired for discriminatory reasons at will. The burden is on the individual to prove discrimination and to bear the substantial costs of the legal process. In reality unless your boss stood in front of a TV camera in public and explicitly stated that he's firing you for discriminatory reasons, you have no recourse whatsoever.</div></div><hr />

<br />
With the loss of subscribers over the last year you can't maintain your current payroll and realize your budgeted profit margin (Blizzard still has shareholders to answer too). In the normal course of business when this happens you look at trimming back office first which means finance, HR, customer support, legal ect ect. The actual game developers and anyone directly relating to the final product would go largely untouched since they are the ones that make you the money. If they did trim in this area it would be teams that were working on future projects that are yet to be announced.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well of course he did, Captain Obvious. First of all the phrase &quot;largely unaffected&quot; is completely subjective. That could very well mean that 49% of the people they fired were game developers and 51% were not. The phrase would still be accurate in some people's opinions, wouldn't it? That aside, the statement as a whole means absolutely nothing.<br />
<br />
Let me ask you this. If you were the CEO of a company, and you had to fire a bunch of developers, would you tell the truth and admit that they were developers, or would you lie and say they were not? Remember no one can confirm or deny your statement either way (since only the company's employees know for sure and they are bound by non-disclosure agreements), and there are no legal prohibitions on lying to the public about hiring and firing developers.<br />
<br />
So what would you do? Would you tell the truth and deliberately make your company and yourself look bad for no benefit whatsoever? Or would you lie to the public, secure in the knowledge that no one has any chance of proving you wrong?<br />
<br />
If basic common sense doesn't help you answer that question, then the fault is yours.</div></div><hr />

The mind-set required to run a small company and large company is very different, and the management structure and practices for a small company can have a very negative impact on a larger company. The company I work for currently is undergoing this process at the moment. It's very easy when you're going through a rapid expansion to recruit too heavily in some areas, then find down the line that you actually didn't need that many in the end. Then you have three options. To get rid of them, to leave them there inflating your payroll demands, or re-train and re-deploy them to an area you do need more people in. While the 3rd option is the most idea, it's going to be unlikely they have the compatible skill set you're looking for. After all you hired them into a different area that they presumably had experience and skills for.I think this statement is a perfectly normal and right thing for Blizzard to do. After such massive growth over the last decade they needed to stop, take a breath and take stock of what they have and more importantly what they actually need.

Think about it this way. One subscriber pays $15/month. Each call center employee is paid probably at least $15/hour and with california taxes and mandatory employee benefits, the company ends up paying at least $75/hour for each employee. If an employee works 160 hours per month, that's $12,000 per employee per month. It takes 800 subscribers to pay ONE customer service rep. Customer service is by far the largest department in Blizzard. With that kind of business model, I'm not sure how you think they're making money &quot;hand over fist&quot;. They've lost 2 million subscribers since 2008, so that's 2,500 people they can't justify jobs for.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard employs thousands of employees, including legal teams, art assets, a large in-house music team (largely unheard of in this industry), a massive in-house legal team, web designers, etc. etc. etc. <br />
<br />
Not only is Blizzard treating them right with a great severance package, but they are giving great recommendations to these people as they look for other jobs.<br />
<br />
And you know what you say is fact based on what exactly?<br />
<br />
Most of what I read in there is corporate jargon for &quot;We're not doing to well so we're making cutbacks.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Largely Unaffected&quot; may mean that while many people weren't fired, they were asked to take pay cuts. While that does mean jobs weren't lost, it may result in those still employed not giving it 100% because they feel the work they are currently doing isn't worth less then what they were making.<br />
<br />
In addition, you're speculating that those being fired were just legal, art, music, and web designers. While this may be the case, it's just idle speculation at this point. It could also be writers, game designers, and many more positions.<br />
<br />
In addition to that, you make it seem like you know that the severance package is going to be a great one. For all you know, it could be a months paycheck and continued health benefits for a month until they find another job or go on unemployment. Trust me, a corporation that has to fire people isn't going to just hand out great severance packages. If that were the case, they'd keep them on working for their pay instead.<br />
<br />
To me, this is a continuing sign that Blizzard as a company isn't as strong as it once was. As a stock holder, this really makes me wonder if the value of the stock is worth the risk of ownership.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Activision or not, it is indeed a result of them being publicly traded.<br />

They added lots of content to satisfy the 1% but in the past it's the 99% that makes this game what it was.<br />

Battlegrounds have gone stale, exploits not fixed for many years.<br />
Blatant PVP imbalances that should be fixed, instead they nerf the typical classes that aren't doing the harm and never nerfed the forever OP classes like Frost Mages.<br />
<br />
Casuals and even semi-hardcores stop playing the game because the game just simply lack content outside of raiding. <br />

They need to fire the lead designers and replace with fresher brains.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Porkrind</div><div class="date">2012-02-29, 06:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Think about it this way. One subscriber pays $15/month. Each call center employee is paid probably at least $15/hour and with california taxes and mandatory employee benefits, the company ends up paying at least $75/hour for each employee. If an employee works 160 hours per month, that's $12,000 per employee per month. It takes 800 subscribers to pay ONE customer service rep. Customer service is by far the largest department in Blizzard. With that kind of business model, I'm not sure how you think they're making money &quot;hand over fist&quot;. They've lost 2 million subscribers since 2008, so that's 2,500 people they can't justify jobs for.<br />
<br />
The way I see it, this is more or less an acceptance that their automated support processes (ie: the I got my Account hacked and all I got was this lousy bag of tokens default hacking response) combined with authenticators and other upgrade security measures have basically made the support staff that was on-hand to deal with this stuff largely irrelevant. <br />
<br />
It's not a bad thing, but people are largely ignorant of the needs of a business and how things may work behind the scenes. Anyone who didn't think this was the expected outcome of all the customer service related changes over the last couple years, just doesn't understand why things happen at their job either. That new automated process they're trying to implement at your job? yeah, that's there to probably get some people pushed out of the company because people are way more expensive to keep. That's business.</div></div><hr />

No, i don't think it's overconfidence, I think it's more that they needed more people at different times and Blizz just didn't want to release anyone. Now that there's more suits involved, they were told more clearly that this is a business, not a club house, and they had to get the most productive people.</div></div><hr />

The money they would raise would not have gone to support current staff levels.

Of course they are making plenty of money but at the same time there isn't half as many tickets being made as what used to be. Alot of people can't be bothered to make them anymore as most people get the feeling nothing gets done anymore.<br />
Sadly for the work force they're not going to keep people on when there's nothing for them to do. As bad as people think it is for the game not going how they want it to, try losin your job!<br />

Because they don't collect 15 a month from all those subs, and in fact, they collect $0 from a lot of them where they are not legally allowed to charge a monthly sub, and only make money from the game purchase or server transfers etc. What they aren't telling everyone is where the majority of their subs come from now. The shift has moved to mostly Asian countries where they cannot make as much. WoW may not be dying, but it's primary demographic has changed.</div></div><hr />

Pretty much what this person said. If you're a qualified game developer looking to get in at Blizzard, now's the time. It's regrettable that people had to lose their job, but this is a positive direction for the company. It's been apparent to most of the community throughout Cataclysm that development has been seriously lacking, and someone at the top has finally noticed and is taking charge to improve the situation. Most people have noticed that ticket queue times are mostly under 15 minutes for the past several months, that's largely due to them not needing the massive amount of customer service reps that they have employed since the wrath boom. Developers get paid much less per-subscriber-affected than customer service reps, so now hopefully they can afford to really grow the gaming experience.</div></div><hr />

It really sucks for those individuals but I doubt it will impact the overall quality of the game, or the game itself in moving forward? Why? Well to me it's pretty simple. Look at all of the changes they have done to ease problems that players might have over the years? Authenticators help against account theft and the ability to trade loot for 2 hours after it was looted helps when people miss loot things. To me it just seems changes like this alleviates a lot of work customer service has to perform and therefor the huge staff they grew over the past 7-8 years in this department is no longer needed. It sucks for these people but that's just the way it is. I myself won't look into it any more than that unless convinced otherwise. No tinfoil hat here!

And before people start talking about RF and RBGs, raid finder is a joke, and rbgs are impossible to get on unless you are on a high pop server.

As I said earlier, it takes roughly 800 U.S. subscribers to pay for one California customer service employee. So the short answer is, yes, that's correct.</div></div><hr />

They need to show growth and the way to do this is to cut positions in order to maximize profits. <br />

Blame the shareholders ... they're the most successful gaming company in history and they're still not happy with what they have and expect even more growth.</div></div><hr />

If that were the case, they'd keep them on working for their pay instead.<br />
<br />
To me, this is a continuing sign that Blizzard as a company isn't as strong as it once was. As a stock holder, this really makes me wonder if the value of the stock is worth the risk of ownership.<br />
<br />
As someone who has been a part of deciding to let people go I can tell you that indeed it is often more cost effective in the long run to offer generous severance packages as opposed to keeping a position filled. The cost advantages come from the fact that you will save on taxes and insurance costs when you eliminate a position so even if you continue to pay their salary for six months in most states you are saving a lot of money in Unemployment, Worker's Comp Insurance, and additional costs that come along with an active employee.<br />
<br />
As for the stock issue, most investment houses will see this a good thing.<br />
<br />
On a side note, someone earlier mentioned that if Blizzard paid someone $15 an hour that it was really costing them $75 an hour to employ that individual. This is beyond exaggeration. Even assuming Blizzard has fairly generous benefits packages that $15 an hour employee might only cost $20 -$25 per hour. You have to think, a portion of payroll taxes Blizzard has to pay on an employee is coming out of that employee's pay as well. If it was costing Blizzard $75 an hour to employ a $15 hourly employee, that employee must have the best medical coverage in the world and have allowances for travel, food and other perks that typically only salaried employees would be given.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Errant</div><div class="date">2012-02-29, 06:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have to agree with what gx240 is saying. Even though he said development was &quot;largely unaffected&quot;, he did insinuate that some developers were given the axe. And considering how lackluster all the cata content was, especially the further along the xpac went, I would be willing to say the game could benefit from significantly more developers, especially considering one of the goals for cata was &quot;more end game content than ever before&quot;. And before people start talking about RF and RBGs, raid finder is a joke, and rbgs are impossible to get on unless you are on a high pop server. Reused models, and probably the most boring end game boss in the games history tell me that development is incredibly short handed.<br />
<br />
It says explicitly that WoW development team was completely unaffected. Any developers that were sac'd came from starcraft, diablo, dota, or titan. What this will do, hopefully, will open up finances to hire more developers for wow, so we CAN get better quality content faster.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tojara</div><div class="date">2012-02-29, 06:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It does make me wonder how 600 positions can be cut but the development teams are &quot;largely unaffected&quot; - just why would a company whose primary function is making software need THAT many non-developer staff?<br />
<br />
Customer service is huge a department.<br />
<br />
Alleviate the most common problems and you see less need for customer service. Just imagine how many tickets they have saved with authenticators and the ability to trade loot for instance. When they said that it was beneficial for them to release authenticators with no profit in mind, that is only half of the story. While they probably didn't make any money off the authenticator itself, they probably were able to cut A LOT of CS as less people were in need of their account being restored. When I got hacked back in WoTLK (when authenticators first came out) it took me a couple of days to get all my stuff back. When I got hacked at the beginning of Cata when authenticators were FAR more common it took me a little over an hour to get all my things back. That's a huge difference. What I can tell from this is CS is less and less backlogged with issues like this, especially issues that are time consuming like account restoration.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ganush</div><div class="date">2012-02-29, 06:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is not surprising or shocking news. As subscriptions decline (which doesn't necessarily mean WoW is dying), there becomes less need for support staff. My guess is that is where the majority of these position cuts come from. Businesses experience ups and downs and Blizzard is obviously on a down. What I see having happened is they decided that WoW should be everything to everyone and as a result none of the demographics who play are getting quality. If Blizzard really wants right the ship, they need to decide firmly on a game model and create a quality content within that model. Like it or not, WoW is their flagship and they have lost their way. It's pure conjecture as to who is responsible and what mandates developers are given, but they need to get back to creating quality content and stop trying to appeal to everyone. Whether they choose to focus on casual players or more serious gamers is a choice they need to make and deal with the results.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Caimbeul</div><div class="date">2012-02-29, 06:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">To all of you saying how can blizzard do this or they make so much money. While its true WoW is one of the most sucessful MMO's globally remember that each country has its own pricing structure. More then half of all the subscribers are likely in places like China where what constitutes a subscriber is very different due to their &quot;pay per minute&quot; type of pricing. Lets assume half of all subscribers pay full for a standard subscription. (Doubtful) Lets assume A median price per player of $13 a month. (Remember LOTS of people pay bulk monthly rates) Thats 13*5million. Or 65 million a month. for a total of 780 million a year. Now lets assume a median income of $40,000 for employees, im gonna assume the higher paid developers are gonna be bringing up the wages of standard CSR members. Last we saw blizzard had 5,000 employees. Now we have a cost of employees of 5,000*40,000. Thats $200,000,000 a year gone right there. A quarter of the profits, gone. If we assumed 3 million players paid a standard subscription rate...That profits drop to less then half. Now, lets take into account lawyers, rent and mortagages, server costs, hardware costs. etc and all that is gonna start chipping away at their profits even more quickly. While yes they are still going to be in the black, they are a publically traded company and therefore have an obligation to ALL of their shareholders to cut losses (Read: Excess Employees) and Maximize profits at all times. In fact they can be held legally accountable in multiple countries if they DONT. Don't get me wrong, it's always terrible when people lose their jobs. But its also a business.</div></div><hr />

The conference call was bad, things will get worse before MoP releases. They are now rushing in Diablo just to get something, anything released slapping broken systems and half assed components into the game. Round 2 will be in about 3 months unless Diablo somehow manages to save jobs. But those jobs are largely customer service no doubt and Diablo won't require near the customer service that WoW does. Look for your tickets to get back up to a week to be answered also.</div></div><hr />

Most of them are quite likely in the lower ranks of Blizzard's staff like tech support and other similar tasks. Considering the 2 million subscription losses they experienced last year, the demand for such posts at their company are decreasing. As sad as it is, if you have no work for them, there is no use having them as employees. <br />

Blizzard is more than the people that develop raids or even WoW and simplifying things like this down to &quot;Hurr Blizzard just wants to save 100k a year because they're greedy&quot; is being clueless.<br />
<br />
He gave no information about who was being cut. For all we know they're rearranging teams and wanted to reduce hierarchy by losing managers. Maybe they're centralising certain accounting or management and no longer need project specific staff. Until details are given any assumptions are exactly that: assumptions.<br />
<br />
Edit: Or as poster below says, customer services scaling back due to falling WoW subs.<br />
<br />
I'd just like to add that there is a reason why the subs are falling and these cuts are actually needed. Blizzard lately seems extremely focused on making more and more money from microtransactions whilst scaling back on content, that's simply the way it is at least to me.</div></div><hr />

They're a fucking business, they're not a charity. If they feel they'll make better profits and/or be more productive, who cares? Greedy? What? You intend to ever work on a game so you earn just enough to pay for a small apartment and basic food? Get a grip. <br />
<br />
I disagree with many things Blizzard and other videogame companies have done, but it just annoys me beyond belief to see all these people talking about a company like it's some bloody charity. <br />
<br />
Do they want to make a profit? TO INCREASE their profits? Of cooooooooooooooourse! It's a business! It's how bloody capitalism works. Don't like it? Don't play it.<br />
<br />
I'll stop playing when I feel the game has nothing else to offer and I'll complain when they implement something I disagree with, not when they haven't announced anything related to in-game content besides some strategic financial decisions. If this makes the game worse, then so be it, they will lose subs and realize it was a bad move. If it makes it better, even if only from a financial perspective, then they have succeeded. I'll reserve judgement for the results when they're actually for show.</div></div><hr />

Just going by the 4600 figure provided by wiki. 600/4600*100. Also, for those that think this has anything to do with the recession: the average full time wage in the US ($40k) for 600 employees could have been paid for a year with 1/4th of the profits of the last quarter of 2011. They lost money in the third quarter, but still made over 500m profit in 2011.<br />

<br />

<br />
Exactly. What recourse do consumers have with a business? Not many. One of them is not purchasing the product they have on offer when they make decisions one disagrees with. Unless one is an Austrian economist or a shareholder, one doesn't need to be an apologist for corporations when they make amoral or immoral decisions that increase their revenue.</div></div><hr />

It was customer support not development. I know one of the guys that was let go. He was a GM &amp; he said other GM's were let go as well.

Surviving in this economy:<br />
<br />
Step 1: Create first new unique mount model for entire expansion <br />
Step 2: Don't reveal where it comes from, raising hype<br />
Step 3: Put mount on Blizzard store for $25<br />
Step 4: ????<br />
Step 5: Make millions of dollars.<br />

Even if we use a ridiculous figure of 500 man hours at $100 an hour (which is completely insane, my company pays engineers half that) that's still only $50,000 of total cost to produce the asset.<br />

They've made MILLIONS of dollars off that investment. Obviously, they know how to turn lead into gold in this economy.</div></div><hr />

I'm willing to be a very large amount of his &quot;worth&quot; is in Blizzard and Activision stock. Its not like he has that cash on hand.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Why would you want someone to be unemployed? You're an awful human being.<br />
<br />
You don't have to be an awful human being to want someone to lose their job. Ghostcrawler and the development team in general at Blizz has really dropped the ball lately. WTF were they thinking with MOP? Or T12 and T13 (T11 was awesome, minus the gap in 10 vs 25 difficulty and some bugs)? When a company has so much riding on a project, which is what WoW is, then they cannot afford mistakes like those that have been made recently. Heads need to roll.<br />
<br />
I can understand why they removed a lot of their support staff. Less players in the game = less customer support needed. It is simple math.<br />
<br />
They need to get on the Dev team next. Find out the teams and people who have pushed the horrible ideas, and start throwing people out on their asses.<br />
<br />
I have been a Blizzard fan since Warcraft 1, and loved WoW when I started playing a few years ago. It pains me to see it go downhill, and D3 is worrying me too (no random PvP or hardcore PvP?!).<br />
<br />
My WoW account is already cancelled until they get their collective heads out of their asses (if they ever do). They really better do it soon, too, because SWTOR took a small chunk out of WoW but if GW2 delivers on all of its promises it is going to carve them up. Then again, that may end up being better for both games. Give GW2 a good playerbase, and make Blizz worker harder on WoW to try to get people to stay, or at least keep their account going. Everyone wins.</div></div><hr />

That's like saying no other company cuts people to save money which is completely false. /facepalm to you<br />
<br />

Oh you have played it?<br />

Sadly this is true. Plus there still hiring for open positions which wouldn't be true if this cut was just to save money.</div></div><hr />
