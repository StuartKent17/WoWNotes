They could ofc not write the patch notes, but their current philosophy means that won't happen. We'd still see them datamined anyways.</div></div><hr />

GarrBuilding #168 - Menagerie - The Menagerie provides new opportunities to develop and enhance your pet retinue. - Provides new pet options and unlocks pet missions<br />
<br />
Pet Missions?! Now that sounds kinda cool. I hope it's like some sort of pet battling dungeon that work like Pokemon Gyms/Caves where you go through several enemies via pet battles and defeat the boss at the end. Whatever it is, it seems like yet another secret feature involved with Garrisons that isn't farming or micro-management. I'm probably being redundant by stating the obvious, but im guessing these missions are only unlocked when you build a Pet Menagerie, which i hear allows you to see all your pets walking around your Garrison with free reign like it was Pokemon Farm. Sounds pretty cool that we get more stuff for pets so they are useful and entertaining. Can't wait to find out more on this.<br />

i really hope garrisons don't end up being manditory for raiding. not something i can be bothered doing on multiple characters every single day I doubt they'd actually do that. so far it seems to be beneficial to optional things like professions, pet battling, leveling gear, gold, a mount or two (according to Blizzcon), etc. What i'm more curious about, is the trade route feature of Garrisons they mentioned at Blizzcon, where you're able to set up trade routes with other people's Garrisons. I wonder if Blizz scrapped that or not. Definitely would like to find out.<br />

Curious what Yrel's Mace is for considering it requires level 70<br />
I bet that's a place holder level, but those stats make it seem pretty convincing. I'd like to get to the bottom of that mystery too :|</div></div><hr />

It's just her weapon she's going to be running around with. Lor'themar Theron has his weapon in the item list datamined in the past as well, for instance (which is a copy of the Greatsword of the Sin'dorei). A number of NPCs are outfitted with a dummy item for equipment.<br />

There's really nothing exciting about it to be honest.</div></div><hr />

If you look at the spell changes again, every healing spec got some kind of mana return, between 1-4%. I'm guessing they are going back on their own mantra of taking out the mana cooldowns. They know the mana cooldowns are needed, but still wanna get rid of the buttons, so now every healer has a minor mana return baked into one of their spells. Or in Paladin's case, they got their Divine Plea button back, except now its 3 hopo for 4.5% mana.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Mistwalker.&quot; Sigh. They take away some of the coolest titles to ever be implemented and give us that? I will not be caught dead with that title on.<br />
Not really sure why this is a complaint. No one said Blizzard took away older FoS titles all for the purpose of giving us &quot;[NAME] THE MISTWALKER!&quot; You ever consider that titles like Warlord, or Hordebreaker were purposefully exclusive so there are titles that actually live up to being a real TITLE? So that people can have pride that they were among the privileged few to earn a name that no one else can get? I dont know about you, but if wouldn't be impressive if everyone was The Scarab Lord, or The Immortal<br />
<br />
As far as cool title names, there are tons. Stormbreaker, Kingslayer, The Insane, Flameweaver, Firelord, of The Nightfall, and the list goes on.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Those axes and shields are ugly and boring. That first axe and sword are pretty nice though. And the scimitars would be nice if they weren't so thick looking. No point in having an agile looking weapon if it's unbelievably bulky and thick. <br />
<br />
I wish they would go back to making simpler looking large weapons like Ashkandi and Obsidian Edge Blade. Or even some of the other weapons from Burning Crusade like that sword from Kil'Jaedan or the golden sword from Tempest Keep. They were huge, but still ornate and fairly believable. Only really chunky weapons I've liked since then would be a.. well I can really only think of Hammer of the Naa'ru or whatever. It's chunky and doesn't look all that believable but it's still elegant and works. <br />
<br />
I feel like they're definition of &quot;Savage&quot; just means giving everything spikes, a very primitive design, and constantly throwing that bulky scratched up metal texture that looks more like cracked stone. If it weren't for that I'd say they would be pretty decent for dungeon blues which is what I'm thinking these are. <br />
<br />
Well, minus those horrible fist weapons. Why is it so difficult for them to make decent looking fist weapons? They did good with the ones from twins in Throne of Thunder, but other than that it's just been disaster after clunky disaster. <br />
<br />
And please, let's not make the bows be large clunky looking stone/metal tusk/spike crap. I can handle some giant bows with some tusk accents and feathers, but no more unnecessary spikes everywhere.</div></div><hr />

Also Mistwalker is a damn cool name. The name of the expansion is &quot;The Mists of Pandaria&quot;. You're getting a title directly from the expansion itself. The title you get is for a hard to achieve/retain feat of strength, that will no longer be obtainable past that point.<br />
<br />
It is going to be a well earned Unique title that no one else will be able to get anymore. 9 CM's means AT best. That's a handful of players with the title and more than one of the cm's have best times done by the same groups. That's a rather rare title.</div></div><hr />

Hopefully someone can confirm this but are these Indian names? Could give us some hints and the cultural influence they are using for Arakkoa. As a note, Chakras are from India. <br />
<br />
Ranjit, Master of the Four Winds - The Arakkoa's penultimate Chakradhaari, Ranjit has mastered the secret techniques required to create gale force winds with his chakra.<br />

Yes, Indian names and therefore, possible Indian (and persian) cultural influence. From a language perspective its a mix of sanskrit and old persian - or 'Avestan' - I wonder if blizzard went after the pun here, too.</div></div><hr />

Not all of them have spikes, alot of the WoD weapons look pretty nice. Even BC-esque due to the wide range of colors and unique designs (i.e. pyramid looking crossbow) instead of just wood brown or steel grey. Even when they do look like that Axe, there is still a bit of color flare (i.e. the purple hilt), and something unique about it like the fact the furnace on it, which is very iconic of the Iron Horde. People were asking for more simplistic weapons in the last preview and now that there are some shown (like those swords in the OP) ppl still complain. I just dont get this community. I say people just dont know what they want. You guys can have your opinions about the gear but just know that there are quite a few gems that have been datamined so far.</div></div><hr />

Not really sure why this is a complaint. No one said Blizzard took away older FoS titles all for the purpose of giving us &quot;[NAME] THE MISTWALKER!&quot; You ever consider that titles like Warlord, or Hordebreaker were purposefully exclusive so there are titles that actually live up to being a real TITLE? So that people can have pride that they were among the privileged few to earn a name that no one else can get? I dont know about you, but if wouldn't be impressive if everyone was The Scarab Lord, or The Immortal<br />
<br />
As far as cool title names, there are tons. Stormbreaker, Kingslayer, The Insane, Flameweaver, Firelord, of The Nightfall, and the list goes on.<br />
<br />
Fairly certain you have completely missed the point. They're removing 'some of the coolest titles in game' ie challenge mode realm best titles like flameweaver, jade protector etc and replacing them all with one generic 'Mistwalker' title. Thus making incredibly rare, individual and cool titles, dissappear, and replacing it with one, vastly more common, less individual and soon to be grossly over used rehash.</div></div><hr />

That was my point. It's not like Titles haven't been removed before. Unless the people who already obtained it dont get to keep it then i dont see your reasoning.</div></div><hr />
