There are two main audiences: Players on PvP servers because that is where they ended up that don't really want to be there. There are also players that love world PvP and want more of it. <br />
The PvP vs PvE server division is going away, replaced by an individual toggle. You can choose if you want to opt in to PvP or not when you are in town. Players that feel trapped on PvP servers have a way out. This opens up the game to changing and improving the world PvP ruleset. <br />

As you're all saying, you just defeated the biggest threat... If every expansion is the next biggest threat, well... it gets a little obvious after a while.<br />
<br />
Story wise, this expansion is taking a break and looking at internal conflict before raising the stakes with the next 'biggest threat to the universe' situation to deal with.<br />
<br />
And for the rest of you saying how pissed you are about your home zones being destroyed. Congrats, you're having the exact reaction Blizz wants you to have.<br />

Quite possible that this is supposed to be some filler addon with meaningless skirmishes that doesn't advance any main story b/c people are tired of the Legion and the Void would essentially be Legion in purple colors.<br />

As a player, I am mainly pissed because it doesn't make sense whatsoever.<br />
The factions are in no condition for a new world war, and quite honestly: if this were the slightest bit realistic, all of them soldiers would be friggin TIRED of war crap.<br />
<br />
I know, they can't make a game for us where everything is peaceful b/c combat is all there is but still. Just feels crappy to regress 10 years.</div></div><hr />

They are essentially portraying a medieval human society. Eventually these humans get tired of warfare. Wives want to have their husbands back. Society needs to recover from heavy losses, economy needs to recover from &quot;war-mode&quot; ect.<br />
<br />
The only races that would realistically (by that I mean: IN CHARACTER) be fine with constant warfare would be Orcs and Forsaken.</div></div><hr />

Right?<br />
<br />
Because if there's one thing most players (as opposed to obnoxious mouth-breathers on some forums) is &quot;MOAR FACTION PVP NAOW!!!!!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Factions are such a fucking stupid concept with this style of execution. All it does is split up your playerbase and add to the rot that is the community.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mmoc2ebc293481</div><div class="date">2017-11-03, 08:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">From official site:<br />
<br />
<br />
Experience the relentless conflict at the heart of the Warcraft saga. Play through six new zones filled with new World Quests, new World Bosses, new raids and more as you determine whether the Horde or Alliance will shape Azeroth’s future.<br />
<br />
What this might mean is:<br />
<br />
1) There is a set ending where either the Horde or the Alliance wins over the other.<br />
2) There is a set ending where no faction can't win and the expansion ends with a truce or something<br />
3) There is no set ending and you, the player, get to decide which faction wins the war according to which faction you play. So if previously you were the champion of your Class Hall, now you'll determine the entire future of your faction and Azeroth itself.<br />
<br />
If 1) or 3) happens, I have no idea what can happen in a future expansion. I mean, will blizzard create a future expansion which has two very different stories based on which faction you are? For example, if you're Alliance, there will be no more Horde in the game in a future expansion from a lore-wise point of view? Will Blizzard keep doing this in every expansion, and how burdersome will it be until it turns out to be a bad idea? Will the game go in a direction where there's no canon lore anymore, where everything is just a &quot;what if&quot; scenario? Or will this be the last expansion (with classic WoW servers announced and all)?<br />
<br />
2) would be the more sane option, but also seems the less exciting. If no faction can't win, then what's the whole point of this expansion?<br />
<br />
<br />
This expansion sounds...I don't even know, to be honest. This can be great or it can be really lame, depending on how they handle it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's really the only way to deal with the server faction imbalances. If it's 10:1, it's not PvP... it's just shitty.<br />

I welcome this change.</div></div><hr />

Guess that means that for example, the bonus for questing PvP-on is +50%, then if you're playing on a heavily unbalanced server, you'll have +40% on PvP-off to compensate</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">FecundDecay</div><div class="date">2017-11-03, 08:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am.... genuinely kinda livid right now.<br />
<br />
There have been many times in WoW history when the fan-base was in an uproar, crying screaming and yelling, threatening to quit or doing so...<br />
Over Cataclysm zone redesigns, over flying mounts, over all kinds of shit...<br />
<br />
And I have always stood by the game, and accepted their artistic vision for what it was. <br />
<br />
But now I find out that the damn Undercity, MY PEOPLE'S HOME LAND, is being &quot;taken&quot; by the opposing faction - along with the entire continent? No Glades, no Deathknell, no Silvermoon, no Silverpine.... after all the art and building updates made in Cataclysm that really nailed the &quot;Forsaken&quot; feel in those zones - now suddenly they're just getting destroyed and/or handed over to the opposing team?<br />
<br />
Undercity is the city I started this game in. It's the city I ALWAYS choose to use over Org or SM. It's the ancestral home-land of my multiple Forsaken characters. It's easily my favorite city in the game, both in terms of look and feel....<br />
<br />
And now I'm losing it?<br />
<br />
I have NEVER been one of those &quot;screw this I quit&quot; people - but unless this is some kind of massive troll there is a very good chance that this is going to finally close the door for me. It was lame enough when Undercity was left using Vanilla textures during the Cataclysm revamp - but for it to just get erased from availability entirely at this point is borderline disgusting. That land and that city is a fundamental part of my experience in WoW, and it has been for over a decade at this point.<br />
<br />
If it's actually gone, there's a damn good chance I'm going with it.<br />
I've really tried over the years to set my own desires aside and let them do what they wanted with their own game...<br />
but this is just going way too damn far. This is crossing a line I didn't even know existed, and I am pretty damn furious about it.<br />
<br />
Ignoring the fact that this whole &quot;now we're back to faction fighting&quot; instead of dealing with any of the light/void plots they spent all of Legion setting up is STUPID - to add insult to injury by destroying or re-assigning two of the coolest capital cities in the game is just....<br />
<br />
it's just plain bad game design.<br />
I am Jack's unquenchable rage.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Funny, toggling off PvP without having to pay a $100+ to transfer my toons is by far the most appealing feature of Horde vs Alliance expansion to me, ironic, not sure it's enough to make me play this expac tho.<br />
<br />
<br />
On top of all that, we know the whole A v H war can't really go anywhere cause they dont want to piss off half the player base... so it'll end in a tie/stalemate/truce as usual and we'll go back to fighting azshara/old gods etc as if the &quot;war&quot; never even happened.

<br />
The entire idea of PvP servers died when they started getting super imbalanced... 5:1... 10:1... so when you roll a character on a PvP server, it's not really a PvP server anymore, because you can just look up which server gives you an extreme advantage and go there. Or else you end up stuck on a server where it's impossible to enjoy anything. There's no fun in getting steamrolled by 20 of the opposing faction when you land at a flightpath.</div></div><hr />

WoW has officially ran out of creativity and quality story telling.<br />
<br />
i mean, seriously, we took down the last despot that tried that faction war (garrosh), and we just completed not one but two campaigns using allies from both the alliance and the horde which took care of some of the worst evils in the universe (the burning legion), and now we're supposed to march back into the stupid faction war? <br />
seriously, the only reasonable reaction RP wise from any player character would be to step into the face of his/her faction leaders and &quot;explain&quot;, politely, that our armies aren't interested in restarting the whole pointless conflict, and that in fact if they really really want a war then our order halls are more then capable of handing them their heads on a platter, and that's not even considering the fact that RP wise we are heroes of our factions and could probably beat our leaders in both a real and a publicity fight (after all, the alliance solders on the battlefield saw their leaders fleeing from the burning legion, while us, the big heroes, stepped up and beat the invasion)</div></div><hr />

Most likely simply under siege or something. If you look at leak from book published yesterday, it mentions Undercity as if it was in big trouble, but it still was there and belonged to horde.<br />
<br />
That's not how they're making it sound. They've said several times in several ways that the entire continents will be controlled by the horde and alliance respectively. <br />
I don't see how we could continue to have a city in the sewers underneath a new alliance city on a landmass they control completely.... that wouldn't make sense.<br />
<br />
I'm holding out hope that they find a cool and interesting way to phase this or something like that - but if it turns out we're just completely losing undercity entirely, then I am more angry than I have ever been about any change this game has ever made in the past.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now you know how the humans felt when they lost it to those filthy undead to begin with. We're just taking back what is ours. Suck it up, buttercup.<br />
<br />
Champ - the Forsaken living in Undercity right now ARE THE REANIMATED PEOPLE of that city. We didn't &quot;take&quot; anything - we moved back into the ruins of our own city after we were killed and turned into zombies, and our city was destroyed by the scourge. The only person in the Forsaken faction that isn't actually from Lordaeron is the Dark Lady herself - the rest of us are exactly where we were before the events of Frozen Throne.<br />
<br />
Maybe you shore L2Lore before you go around beating your chest. None of the playable humans on the alliance faction are from Lordaeron - that's why you start out on the other side of the damn world in Stormwind. e_e You want Strom? Have fun. You want to re-take all the plaugelands? You want to go take Stratholme back? HAVE FUN! That's all yours. Lordaeron is our home, and it always has been. If anyone here is &quot;taking it&quot; it would be your faction.</div></div><hr />

Not for me. Most people were just logging in for raid night. Now in Legion you are expected to do WQs and mythic+ if you want to raid. You need to play the game much more often than back in classic. MoP was probably the best time because there you could do most things with very little time.</div></div><hr />

Also there is RPG issue. When taking daily quest player went to NPC to talk, got quest, then handed it over. World quests don't make any sense there - no lore connection, no faction connection - just fast todo junk that randomly spawns and despawns for no apparent reason.</div></div><hr />

i mean, why would we split along faction lines at this point? i could maybe see the order halls going to war with each other, but there's no reason to go back to faction warfare. <br />
in fact, from an RP point of view. we, the heroes of azeroth, would be more likely to kick out any leader who suggested such an idea on the assumption he's either too self centered, or corrupted by outside influence (and we have the power to do it, remember most of us lead our united cross faction order halls, with the best gear and warriors at our disposal).</div></div><hr />

Yes of course I'm not defending or arguing in favor (or not) of those features. But Garrisons and Artifact were completely new mechanics and that is always good to take.<br />
<br />
Plus, even though WoD Garrisons were a complete failure, I liked the improvements made in Legion (with class quests, some were very interesting). And the Artifact is nice if you take away the grind part. Cool weapon, with talent tree (well that was true at the beginning, where you had to chose the talents you wanted, now it's just a clickfest), several skins.<br />
<br />
The fact that Battle for Azeroth doesn't bring anything new makes me feel it is a complete filler expansion, where we will have to fight against the other faction just because we didn't find anything else to do.<br />
<br />

On the one hand, I'm excited NOT to be dealing with the end of the world (again). On the other, it seems as much out of place in the line of plot as WoD did following MoP (not to mention that nothing we did in WoD seemed to have any lasting anything... from a Legion perspective, it's as if WoD basically didn't happen). I'm also very disappointed that coming together to save Azeroth has resulted in, &quot;Okay, but we've been sharing this world with each other too long, DIE DIE DIE!&quot; This seems stupidly out of character for Anduin, particularly when one of the highlights of Legion was Varian suddenly realizing his son was right. This is essentially saying, &quot;No, Dad, you were right all along.&quot; Meh. However, I'm definitely going to see where the storyline goes.<br />
<br />
What I don't appreciate is, as a PvP server player... who the hell asked for forced PvP flags? The whole reason people play on PvP servers is the added challenge of not knowing who is lurking around the corner. Switching the entire game to PvP flags is a horrible move.<br />
<br />
I have to say... definitely not as excited as I have been for every previous expansion, but definitely eager to explore new zones. I'll wait to see what additional features pop up as we go forward, as the expansion does seem a little feature-light, but we'll see...</div></div><hr />

Or else you end up stuck on a server where it's impossible to enjoy anything. There's no fun in getting steamrolled by 20 of the opposing faction when you land at a flightpath.<br />
<br />
Except, of course, that on a PvE server, you have the ability to flag yourself in and out of PvP. A PvP server is, by its very nature, non-flaggable. If they simply merged all the PvP servers into one &quot;battlegroup,&quot; where there was no longer any advantage to choosing a low-pop server, that would be fine.

No one is saying we want peace, just saying that this reignited faction war doesn't make any sense considering we were literal brothers in arms and allies with each through the class halls throughout all of Legion. It's coming out of nowhere and doesn't make sense lore wise at this point. Apparently the book coming out will address this, but as of now without that context the cinematic just felt like the season premier of a show where some serious game changing shit went down in the previous season finale and EVERYONE missed the season finale.</div></div><hr />

You Level<br />
You do 5mans / unrated pvp<br />
You raid / rated pvp<br />
<br />
Only way &quot;Artifact Power&quot; will work is if the rewards are strictly cosmetics or non power items like mounts, transmogs, titles, tabards, wings, &quot;glows&quot;, toys and things like that. I also made a huge post on official forums before Legion about this, the problem is that as soon as something becomes a power upgrade everyone who wants to compete with their friends or fight for raid spots, even in the shittiest guilds, will feel pushed and forced into grinding as hard as possible. Ever heard anyone speak about grinding as a fun thing? No, because it's not. Doing the same easy content over at over on auto pilot is NOT fun. So what happens if people are pushed/forced into grinding the same shit for hour after hour? They get burnt out, I did and a lot of people I know and played with got burnt as well.<br />
However if the rewards didn't give you any power the designers could get creative and the players could target the rewards they liked at their own pace. This makes the grind completely optional and with no rush to get it done, you could have daily quests for extra artifact power (cosmetic coins) in the same area as a regular daily/world quest but click this extra item 15 times. Now if you didn't care about cosmetics at all you could skip that, happy days, if you care about cosmetics you can spend a little time on it while you play all the parts of the game.<br />

But the faction war doesn't make much sense to me... but we will see how it goes.<br />
<br />
Only think, if the Horde burn Teldrassil BEFORE the Alliance attack Lordaeron I'll be pretty irritated. Can the Horde, for once, not be the instigators? Garrosh, Wrathgate and even the death of Varian? It's enough, let the Alliance start the fight for once. Let them be the supposed instigators for once.<br />
<br />
A cool idea that was suggested is that maybe Genn goes full retard, makes a small faction of Worgen extremists and they are the ones that instigate the war and burn down Teldrassil but manage to make it look like it was the Horde? Could be interesting... just sayin'. Genn is pretty much the Alliance Garrosh now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. So is the garrison/guild hall mechanic totally gone? I see no mention of anything similar. (I see the mention of &quot;warfronts&quot; but that seems more like the Broken Shore &quot;Mage Tower&quot; Mechanic)<br />
<br />
2. I see artifact weapons are getting &quot;a proper send off&quot; (which wasn't unexpected) but what will be replacing them? I see some mention of Azerite as the &quot;Artifact Power&quot; and a note that the artifact empowerment trees will be going away. So will there be a new generation of artifact weapons or are we going back to pre-Legion where you get weapons as quest rewards and drops, but you will be able to somehow modify and empower this weapons with azurite?</div></div><hr />

Azeroth is gifting us with a medallion that gathers power from the lifeblood of Azeroth that is seeping out around the world. Further you empower it the more you can empower 3 armor slots with new sort of talent rows for each piece that are &quot;customizable&quot; instead of just linear progression like legion artifacts. There was an image of a turn dial with 4-5 layers.</div></div><hr />

the option is intended for PVE players who play on a PVP realm for different reasons. and since this is probably going to be a base feature, a.k.a something coded into the player base class, it obvious it will apply to all players. brain to hurt?</div></div><hr />

On the one hand, I'm excited NOT to be dealing with the end of the world (again). On the other, it seems as much out of place in the line of plot as WoD did following MoP (not to mention that nothing we did in WoD seemed to have any lasting anything... from a Legion perspective, it's as if WoD basically didn't happen). I'm also very disappointed that coming together to save Azeroth has resulted in, &quot;Okay, but we've been sharing this world with each other too long, DIE DIE DIE!&quot; This seems stupidly out of character for Anduin, particularly when one of the highlights of Legion was Varian suddenly realizing his son was right. This is essentially saying, &quot;No, Dad, you were right all along.&quot; Meh. However, I'm definitely going to see where the storyline goes.<br />
<br />
<br />
tbh i didnt even thought about this but when you mention this - lol - this intro is literal &quot;f...ck legion intro&quot; in which Varian admits that they need to fight together<br />
<br />
no f.... wonder Metzen left - they shit alll over on his lore with this. and that why they hired his replacment who will write nythign as long as they pay her.<br />

<br />
Maybe an old god &quot;took over&quot; Genn/Jaina to stir up some shit as a distraction, so that the Black Empire/Azshara could easily take over in 8.1 ?<br />
<br />
Edit: See, after we fought off most of the titans, including a fallen avatar here and there, we are pretty much gods lore-wise. It wouldn't make sense to go full on against us at this point without considerably weakening us beforehand. Azshara and N'Zoth would've probably realize that by now. Even Yogg had to prepare a bit.<br />
<br />
After we get rid of the artifact weapons, the veil and sorrow will probably by the driving force. A pissed-off night elf 5man will shit all over the whole Black Empire after what they will have caused.</div></div><hr />

In other words, war between the two factions is pointless. I can see how they wanted to go back to the basics, after all we did just have an over-the-top, Planet vs Planet in space kind of deal. But after that this just feels so...mediocre for storytelling purposes.<br />
<br />
As far as features and stuff go, it's all more of the same. This expansion, so far, feels like a really big content patch, not an expansion. Feels like this is the WoD expansion to lead into the good stuff they put all of their focus into in the background. Something very simple and quick.</div></div><hr />

It's just a rehash of Theramore got nuked while Ogrimar was sieged.<br />
<br />
You may have forgotten, but I remember:<br />
Worgen starting quest storyline<br />
Robo Kitty<br />
<br />
The whole mess that was Cataclysm and MoP. I think I will take my money elsewhere. Not to mention horde racial advantage which was only offset by mid expansion change of the human racial - only one race in alliance had an advantage over horde. Then it got nerfed. As it is right now, horde racials are so much better than alliance racials, any PvP focused expansion is going to be a horrible experience for anyone who picked the wrong faction at the character selection screen.</div></div><hr />

Yep, every major feature just feels like a low effort reskin/rename of existing features.. Subraces just recolors of old races basically, artifact necklace is just artifacts without all the cool custom weapon art, &quot;islands&quot; are new scenarios (same thing as the broken isles legion invasion scenarios from the sound of it). Warfronts.. new world pvp zone ala Tol Borad.... never trust blizzard to make those good. Nothing feels actually new in terms of gameplay. Filler expansion is filler.</div></div><hr />

After Legion, we are back to WoD standards. Absurd and forced plot, dramatic lack of innovative features, lots of smoke and mirrors but not much substance. <br />
<br />
At a moment were the game was back on its feet after the WoD debacle, they needed to decisively push on innovating and improving core aspects of the game, instead they come out with this &quot;meh&quot; expansion. Sub-races, which could have been at least a decisive innovation, deliver much less than expected and are obviously gated beyond some grind. No thanks. <br />
