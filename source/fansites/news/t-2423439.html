Upcoming Feral Buffs<br />
As well, please, i beg you, make berserk stays up when you change the form, countless times i needed to change form to cast a regrowth to buff my bleed damage via bloodtalon (first time), only to see berserk buff vanishing.<br />
Going to send a hotfix soon to fix this. Berserk should persist through shapeshifting, same as Tiger's Fury and Incarnation: King of the Jungle. Thanks for pointing it out.<br />
<br />
After doing our internal testing, taking into consideration the feedback here and elsewhere, we're now going forward with the following damage increases:<br />
<br />
Brutal Slash: +20% Damage<br />
Swipe: +15% Damage<br />
Thrash: +15% Damage<br />
<br />
We don't have a precise timeframe for this to hit the live game, but we expect it in the next 48 hours or so.<br />
<br />
<br />
Bounty Bag Hotfix<br />
We've hotfixed the bounty bags to always reward 100 honor, regardless of how many you loot. Keep in mind looting bounties also increments the achievement &quot;Bounty Hunting&quot; which is needed for the meta achievement &quot;Conqueror of Azeroth&quot; which rewards a title and mount.<br />
<br />
When the season begins, Bounty Bags will reward Conquest.<br />
<br />
Thanks for feedback, and the lively discussion!<br />
<br />

No WoW Panel at gamescom<br />
We do not have a dedicated World of Warcraft panel at gamescom this year as such.<br />
<br />
We instead have a series of other activities such as Island Expeditions showcases with 2 top German guilds battling it out, a Battle for Azeroth cosplay showcase, Video Games Live performances featuring a live rendition of the sea shanty from Warbringers: Jaina, and the reveal of Warbringers: Azshara.<br />
<br />
Warbringers: Azshara will be shown directed after the Battle for Azeroth cosplay showcase which will be streamed live from 18:15 CEST on Friday, 24th August.<br />
<br />
We posted a blog yesterday that covers all the WoW related stuff happening at gamescom this year:<br />

<br />
Call to Arms: Vol'dun Quest<br />
Need to remove the Air Supply Crate. You shouldn't base this quest on whether you get lucky or not. I have been in this wasteland for over an hour, and ran to 2 chests that were called out only to have one despawn in front of me and the other despawn before I got there.<br />
<br />
It's not fun what so ever. So, either remove it, or let them last A LOT longer and pin them on the map.<br />
We agree. We are removing the Air Drop requirement in a hotfix. Should be live soon.<br />
<br />

What, you didn't know? It's perfectly fine for Rip to do more damage in Resto spec with feral affinity.<br />

Absolutely fine.<br />
<br />
This is the case for all healers, and the reverse is true as well. Swiftmend with Resto Affinity does almost double what it does as Resto. It's because you have other things to compensate with, though Feral has few.</div></div><hr />

I would agree with you if all of the ferals were not complaining about how low damage is. Feral damage is pretty bad right now. It is not just the casulas that are complaining but the guys that have been mythic raiders for the last few expansions.</div></div><hr />

Well I've gotten a lot of top 1% logs as Feral and these &quot;buffs&quot; will do nothing, absolutely nothing to fix or help Feral problems right now. <br />
<br />
There are Ferals on the official forums who are in world top 50 guilds and who competed at the mythic dungeon invitational saying they are not going to make any difference and are going to re-roll, so if you wont believe the literal top 1% of feral players, who are you going to believe? Blizzard? LOL</div></div><hr />

Just to clarify, the reason I said &quot;AoE abilities that ... might as well not ... exist&quot; is that Swipe and Thrash make up so very little of a Feral cat's AoE damage. Most of it still comes from spreading single-target bleeds, because our true AoE skills are so laughably weak.<br />
<br />
If frost mages were having serious performance issues, this change would be like saying, &quot;we're buffing your damage when you auto-attack with a wand by a staggering 20%!&quot; A large-ish looking percentage buff to an ability that would need to be more than doubled in power to be useful.</div></div><hr />
