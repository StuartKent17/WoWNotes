Dev Interviews<br />
IGN (www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/14/gamescom-2015-world-of-warcraft-legion-is-embracing-the-past-to-secure-its-future? hub page (front page)) had the opportunity to talk to some developers recently. <br />
<br />
<br />
Players were excited by interacting with heroes from the past in Legion.<br />
Garrisons were a good idea, but didn't live up to their full potential.<br />
By the time the team realized the problems with garrisons, they were halfway through the expansion and working on the next one.<br />
The team doesn't think about subscriber numbers on a regular basis, as it doesn't help to make the game any better.<br />
The team is aware of the Orc fatigue. <br />
Sylvanas is back and going to play a huge role in this expansion.<br />
Thrall will continue to evolve in Legion.<br />
Creating new characters in the lore that weren't in older Warcraft games is challenging, but the team is getting better at it. Garrosh is a good example of a new character that worked.<br />
Having a year between the last patch and new expansion doesn't work well, so the team is continuing to try and shorten the gap. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Developer Communication<br />
Several developers talked about the change in communication in reference to a blog post by another game developer (http://askagamedev.tumblr.com/post/126941182591/do-you-ever-feel-like-the-industry-is-too) today. Be sure to read the full post for context.<br />
<br />
Blog Post Key Points (Non-Blizzard Blog):<br />
<br />
You never get a second chance at a first impression - A first impression is really important. We can’t just show you all of the nasty in-development stuff, because it’s not pretty.<br />
Timing is important - The marketing department is to get as many people as they can interested in the game at the time it is released, but the public can also get turned off if they get an information overload<br />
Game development is malleable, fan expectation is not.<br />
<br />
A lot of things get cut during development. <br />
Sometimes it’s for technical limitations, sometimes it’s for budget limitations, sometimes it’s for licensing, most of the time it’s for scope and schedule. <br />
The hard core fans especially will take what the developers say as a promise, and we simply can’t make promises during development because features get cut all the time.<br />
They’ll call us liars or won’t believe us because we SAID we’d do feature B and we didn’t, and so we can never be trusted and we are the worst developers EVER and the game is doomed and so on and so forth.<br />
<br />
People don’t really understand game development, but think they do<br />
<br />
It’s really really easy to be an armchair game developer. <br />
The general public is never going to have access to all of the information that the developers with which to make their decisions. <br />
Gamers really don’t understand game development any more than diners understand how a restaurant is actually run. <br />
Most gamers out there don't really care about the nitty-gritty of game development. They just want to know that the game they want is going to have the features that they want.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The sooner the era of &quot;DEV SAID IT, MUST BE TRUE OR RIOT&quot; ends the better. <br />
It's bizarre if you think about it - no one expects TV shows or movies or music to show WIP cuts that are unfinished outside of marketing.<br />
In games if we show a concept of a thing (just a concept!) it's somehow locked in as a thing that we failed to deliver if it isn't fun.<br />
Working in an environment where we can't share anything because of how the community latches on and turns it in to a weapon is not great.<br />
The space between &quot;here's an incomplete thing, give us feedback&quot; and &quot;here's a thing that's pretty but can't change much&quot; is -tiny-.<br />
This is a problem both game studios and the community have to work on, I'm not blaming the community, but it's on the harsh side right now. (nite_moogle (https://twitter.com/nite_moogle/status/633725919350398976))<br />
<br />
it can also be very hard for people to express things civilly unfortunately when they're extremely passionate about said thing<br />
About 80% of the time when someone on the Internet types &quot;passion&quot; they use it as a green light to be a big jerkface (nite_moogle (https://twitter.com/nite_moogle/status/633731186691469312))<br />
<br />
Yeah. A well-known reason devs don't talk more, that people often mention, is the &quot;everything is a promise&quot; problem. But now I've noticed others more, like &quot;if you give a bit information, people reach conclusions about the entire (99% unseen) game.&quot;<br />
I'd never thought about that one until it became a huge widespread pattern in Warlords beta.<br />
If we mention new thing X, people will imagine the game &quot;Warlords with only change X&quot; and, basically, review it. (HamletEJ (https://twitter.com/HamletEJ/status/633729413578813440))<br />
<br />
We said too much WAY too soon in development for Warlords, and the design direction shifted from what we talked about. <br />
It was a huge mistake that we are doing our absolute best not to repeat with Legion. (CM_Lore (https://twitter.com/CM_Lore/status/633742483189460992))<br />
We obviously can't and won't make promises, but we're trying not to talk about things we're not at least somewhat confident in.<br />
Reality is, hundreds of good ideas come and go for every game in the industry. Honestly best not to expose players to that.<br />
I don't really blame the players. We should have known better. (CM_Lore (https://twitter.com/CM_Lore/status/633786284822007809))<br />
<br />
<br />
Ghostcrawler Tweets<br />
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br />
Developer Communication<br />
since you've left, Greg, the devs have gone silent. It's like...idk...they don't think we're worth talking to.<br />
I really doubt that is the case. It's more likely a policy thing not lack of motivation or desire. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/628723646735872000))<br />
<br />
From what I've read you seem like a pretty cool dude. For those of us who don't know, could you fill us in on your past at Blizzard? Why all the hate on you?<br />
I was the lead systems designer on WoW for several years. My team did class, item, encounter, combat, PvP, UI and really most things that weren't level or quest design.<br />
<br />
Riot tries to encourage all Rioters to be out talking to players, but Blizzard had more of a spokesperson policy where very few of us were out there on forums or other social media. One big downside of the way that works is, for better or worse, you might be the one name players know, and they might project anything they like or don't like about the game onto you.<br />
<br />
While I would say on the whole that players appreciated the attempts at communication, there were some who blamed me personally when their class was nerfed or they thought dungeons should be easier or they thought dungeons should be harder or... you get the idea.<br />
<br />
It's a nuanced discussion because as a lead I am still fine with players wanting to call me out on things they don't like. I was and still am partially accountable for the design quality of the games I work on. So if you have a complaint, I am fine to hear it. Feedback is great. But that does *not* mean that I personally made every change myself. If I really nerfed your warrior because I was beat by a warrior the night before, then I would be a petty asshole and would deserve to lose my job. <br />
<br />
The same is true of League. There is no way I would be able to ninja in a change to a champion that the team wasn't behind. I couldn't dumb the game down unless for some reason that was the direction Riot wanted to go. (Spoiler: it isn't.) I have opinions on things but it's not a company of dictators. We work collaboratively towards certain values.<br />
<br />
But all that said, if you have a concern or complaint about the game, please let me know. I don't have context on everything going on but I can usually find the right person or team and make sure they hear the feedback.<br />
<br />
Thanks for asking. <br />
<br />
In your experience, what factors typically tend to dissuade or discourage game developers and companies from more open communication with players? Is this something playerbases in favour of communication can help to remedy?‎<br />
There are - by far - three concerns that keep developers from communicating with players.<br />
<br />
One is fear of saying something wrong. This could be accidentally leaking something or saying something that comes across as an insult. There ultimately isn't any real fix for this problem except experience. You can ask a coworker to proofread, but if the communication has to go through too many levels of editing and approval, then it's inefficient at really having a discussion with players.<br />
<br />
Second is the fear of getting sucked into an endless conversation. This happens on forums and Reddit easily. Players are interested in having debates and asking additional questions, so a developer post that is intended to be quick and dirty ends up going back and forth and suddenly it's 2 AM, but if you try and pull out, you risk sending the message that you lost interest or don't care. This isn't as big an issue as the others.<br />
<br />
The third is that it takes very thick skin. Players are mean. Period. You can argue that they have a right to treat devs however they want. But the truth of the matter is that a lot of developers do get chased out of the conversation because they can't stand the negativity and it makes them hate their job. I have been doing this a very long time, so it doesn't affect me, but I know it affects a lot of the people I work with now or in the past. I've had bosses that told me directly &quot;Don't read forums,&quot; because they know what a productivity hit it can be to get torn down all the time. (I didn't listen to them, but people do.)<br />
<br />
As far as what players can do, it's pretty obvious. Don't be toxic. When someone is there to have a conversation with you, have a conversation. You don't have to be a white knight. But it does help to be professional. If you have a disagreement with someone at work or school or with a friend, you are probably equipped with conflict resolution skills that help you handle those situations without creating a permanent enemy. Use those skills online. Don't view forums etc. as your personal venting space (again, if your desire is to have developers participate in the conversation). Don't take things out of context. Don't mock them. It's fine to be passionate, upset or angry, but you can convey that without name calling.<br />
<br />
Again, I'm not telling anyone how to act. I'm offering suggestions for how to act if your desire is to see more game developers (from any company) talking to players in a way that doesn't come across as uber-polished marketing speak. <br />
<br />
Legion<br />
I know you don't like talking about wow but I feel you always have good answers. Honest opinion on Legion :P?<br />
Looks great to me. I like how they are being adventurous with classes and items. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/629679798273441792))<br />
<br />
Artifact weapon in legion, AWESOME! or Meh? Also, is that a recycled Path of the Titans that comes with the Artifact weapon (Trait Tree)?‎ <br />
Seems cool to me. I don't know how consciously the team chose to follow the Paths of the Titans design, but I agree that the intent seems similar. I'm glad for it to see the light of day in a situation where players can really experience it as a fully-developed feature. <br />
<br />
What do you think about the new Honor system for Legion? If I remember right, you we're kind of against splitting ability for PvP and PvE.‎ <br />
*I* was not against it. Blizzard was against it, and it appears they have pivoted on that philosophy at least to some extent. The PvE and PvP had already diverged pretty significantly with regards to gear, trinkets especially, and some PvE abilities that just didn't work on players or did less damage. <br />

<br />
Perhaps the greatest mistake here. Everyone working on any kind of product should always look at adoption rates to understand what is gaining traction is what is rebuffing users from joining / re joining. It's very basic business to identify what works best and push on that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Most of the interviews took place in the day or two after Gamescom, so no one knew what had already been asked. This one is IGN, they want to talk about the new expansion and lessons learned broadly, not just hunt for new information and assume their readers have seen all of the other interviews.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, just fk our subsribers. We do not give a sheet. /facepalm<br />
<br />
<br />
A lot of things get cut during development.<br />
<br />
I would say: Most of things get cut during development.<br />

<br />
They’ll call us liars or won’t believe us because we SAID we’d do feature B and we didn’t, and so we can never be trusted and we are the worst developers EVER and the game is doomed and so on and so forth.<br />
<br />
Why the heck do you promise ANYTHING dear Blizzard?? So basically you can just say in next 3 months: 'we cut artifacts coz they suck'.<br />
They did the same with Path of the Titans, new dances, Farahlon and a lot of other things in previous expacks.<br />
<br />
Anyway Blizzcon goodie bag except nice bag looks poor imho. (that Zealot psionic blade - LOL)</div></div><hr />

<br />
It as if they have come to the conclusion that Warlords was bad only because the devs over-shared.<br />
<br />
No. Warlords came out of the gate being great... until you hit that first Heroic dungeon and the gear that dropped was just terribly low. How the hell does that happen 10 years into this game?<br />
<br />
Then Garrisons just became this time consuming waste of time.<br />
<br />
This was the Steam Early Access Expansion. They released a very front heavy expansion, they over-hyped it with all of their nonsense articles (player accessories anyone?), and they KNEW what they were doing.<br />
<br />
LFR- cheaper and easier to make than new dungeons and scenarios.<br />
Garrisons- cheaper and easier to make than new content- 6.1 was a total scam patch and they have all but admitted this now.<br />
Moving faction hub cities to Ashran- cheaper and easier than coming up with a good reason to get players to play in their new world pvp zone.<br />
<br />
I have hope in Legion. But there is a lot of comfortable managers on Team WoW. Yes- I am being a jerkface. Grow up. Business is business. Stop acting like children at your jobs. You are paid by us to create stuff we want. If we do not like what you are creating or believe you are acting like a sleazy electronic bait and switch shop, we are allowed to be A-holes about it.</div></div><hr />

Well alot of adults are getting as stupid as the kids they complain about too. Like maybe it shows that people who shouldn't be playing MMOs or games in general are those who complain the most. Like these people think they understand game develop, thinking it is easy or something.<br />
<br />
I have always said it, I rather WoW have 2 Million players who have a brain, understand design limitations &amp; how a MMO should be, Over 10-12 Million morons who want the best gear from little effort or thinking everything is meant for them. I think the best thing for WoW as a game is for the idiots to drop it even if it means losing subs cause maybe than the Devs will be able to be more transparent in the future without morons thinking everything they show is a promise &amp; not just a concept or idea they're looking to do or wanting to do in the future. WoD is a different animal &amp; they have admitted they screwed up, but it is funny people keep trying to say their pushing the blame on the players. When in reality they can't say it, but 80% of their players are bloody morons with no clue what happens in game design.</div></div><hr />

It's annoying and sad.<br />
Grow up and realize that you aren't the center of the universe.<br />
<br />
And what's all this shit about 'I'm a costumer, therefore I deserve to get what I want'. That's not how the world works. In what industry do customers get what they want? Have you ever raged at a clothing manufacturer because they didn't produce the clothes you wanted? Or did you rage at Coca Cola because New Coke XY didn't taste as you expected? No, you didn't. You just don't buy a product if you don't like it. It should be the same with WoW. If you don't like where WoW is going just don't play it and look for something else in life. You are also free to give feedback in the hopes that in the future you get what you want. But they are not forced to do what you want them to. Raging certainly won't achieve anything.</div></div><hr />

This is very simple if you watch human behavior atleast a bit.<br />
<br />
<br />
But adults are expected to behave as such, and not treat the people who make a product, for which YOU decide to pay or not, as complete shit like a couple of angsty teenagers. <br />
What they are saying is that people, even adults who should know better, are making (very harsh) judgments about things they simply know little about. That's a fact, not trying to be demeaning. But aside from armchair gamedesign, which happens too much, people know nothing of a) the complete feedback and statistics that Blizz does have access to, and b) the decisions and their reasons, made by trained developers. <br />
<br />
So don't give me this &quot;adult&quot; business. Behave like an adult and know what you can and cannot give an informed opinion about, remind yourself that it is an opinion, and remember that if you want to be treated respectfully, you in turn must provide your opinion in a respectful and adult manner. Expecting to be treated like a prince while bashing people who genuinely care and who can and WILL be hurt by your flaming, is rather childish, don't you agree?</div></div><hr />

And what in this world doesn't die slowly? (Well, there are things like certain microbes and prostitution). But that's just how the world works. Get used to it if you wanna grow up. Even you and your wife and your children will die slowly (or very fast sometimes). Or have you been using the same smartphone for 10 years? Seriously, some people have weird notions.<br />
<br />
There is something called product life cycle in economics. If you remove the outliers from WoD and MoP release you get pretty much this (http://productlifecyclestages.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/product-life-cycle-stages.jpg) curve.<br />
I'm not saying that WoD wasn't bad. It was. But still. Expecting that WoW could have stayed at 10M subscribers with better developers is just not a reality.</div></div><hr />

Yes, clearly the problem is their laziness, not your complete ignorance.<br />
- Every mount is build from the same model. Ok, let's start from the basics. Do you even know what a model IS?<br />
- Revamping dungeons/raids. Is there really THAT much of that going on? Are we still grinding Strat Scarlet, then moving on to MC and BWL so we can get into Naxx? At most, there is one revamped dungeon per expansion, and it's not even a copy-paste of the old one, it's an old location refreshed to reflect the passage of time.<br />
- No PvP gear. Yes, I'm sure the reason they're ditching the concept of PvP gear is so they don't have to create one more shoddy-looking piece of armor.<br />
- No new zone in Legion. Have you even read ANYTHING about Legion?<br />
<br />
ALL THE REST is still vanilla? With the coming of the new race models, the only thing from vanilla that is still around is some pieces of gear and the classic dungeons and raids. Or did you miss Cataclysm, where they had to create the entirety of the two continents nearly from scratch to facilitate flying?<br />
<br />

No, their saying that they screwed up talking about to much &amp; than players thought they were all promises. Yet didn't realize that alot of plans change during development, just most of the stuff talk about never see the light of day.

Ok mounts, maybe 4-5 models excist! All wotlk dragons = same, same as for the serpents in mop.<br />
And yes, revamping the whole world in cata was big. But im talking about legion and further.<br />
<br />
Besides this, think about CoD. same length as years as wow, different engines, models, sounds en tons od shit.<br />
Wow, 11 year old engine, models. Finally after 9 year they went revamping characters.... Whooo what a progress. Thats just complete lazyness</div></div><hr />

Probably nothing out of the ordinary. Being more cautious is completely understandable these days.<br />

I think this site needs a name change &quot;mmo&quot; is very misleading, &quot;blizzard games almost exclusively&quot; should fit way better. Hearthstone is not an MMO at all yet it gets more cover than actual MMO's. <br />

What's wrong with having a site being focused on Blizzard content? It did start out as a WoW site after all. And it's not even true what you're saying, I've seen a lot of news and links to news on other MMOs here. GW2, Wildstar, FF14 to name a few.</div></div><hr />

This site has always been about WoW &amp; most recently Blizzard games, don't try to play stupid &amp; think it was ever about any other MMO. You know damn well that the only time other MMO news pops up when their is no WoW news or it is a Curse promotion.</div></div><hr />

And yes, revamping the whole world in cata was big. But im talking about legion and further.<br />
<br />
Besides this, think about CoD. same length as years as wow, different engines, models, sounds en tons od shit.<br />
Wow, 11 year old engine, models. Finally after 9 year they went revamping characters.... Whooo what a progress. Thats just complete lazyness<br />
<br />
There's, what? 350-400 mounts in the game? With 4-5 models, that should mean that each mount has over 70 recolors. Damn, I never noticed there were that many drakes and cloud serpents.<br />
<br />
Again, you are completely disregarding their hard work, because YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW STUFF IS MADE. You probably just think they type &quot;new engine&quot; and a full set of badass graphics appears out of thin air.</div></div><hr />

If only people knew how others games re use models &amp; that it is a normal thing in game design. Having to create a new model &amp; new animations takes longer than they truly think it does.</div></div><hr />

You don't know what they could be doing, because you don't know what they ARE doing. That's the point. You are so clueless about the process that you cannot possibly draw a sound conclusion on whether the outcome is the best they could do or not.

If anything the more silent Blizzard is a direct result of just how incredibly terrible the WoW community is. They can literally not share a thought without people throwing themselves over it.<br />
<br />
I know. I am so pissed at how people are treating him like some back door critic on blizzard. People treated him terrible he decided to quit answering questions. A few days later he ammended that decision, clearly showing us that he got so distressed he just wanted to quit player communication altogether.<br />
<br />
What they are saying is exactly right.<br />
<br />
I mean think about Garrisons. They just had some models , a few pictures and some ideas at blizzcon. THen it wen tthrough development and the way they presented it wasnt reasonable. they never sold it as player housing but people assumed that anyways. And all the other B.S. about them keeping it in one location. <br />
<br />
Yea they said they wanted it in multiple locations. But then Development changed that. And people were pissed because they thought blizzard promised them something!<br />

Exactly, a huge problem. Now they want to remedy this by discussing ideas and concepts a lot less, at least until they know they can do something with it. I can promise you however that people are now going to start yelling and bitching about lack of communication / teasing new features.</div></div><hr />

What they are saying is that people, even adults who should know better, are making (very harsh) judgments about things they simply know little about. That's a fact, not trying to be demeaning. But aside from armchair gamedesign, which happens too much, people know nothing of a) the complete feedback and statistics that Blizz does have access to, and b) the decisions and their reasons, made by trained developers. <br />
<br />
So don't give me this &quot;adult&quot; business. Behave like an adult and know what you can and cannot give an informed opinion about, remind yourself that it is an opinion, and remember that if you want to be treated respectfully, you in turn must provide your opinion in a respectful and adult manner. Expecting to be treated like a prince while bashing people who genuinely care and who can and WILL be hurt by your flaming, is rather childish, don't you agree?<br />
<br />
No, this is not how consumer behavior and market economy works. If you sell me a food in restaurant made of rotten ingredients that gives me stomach ache i dont politely give you my feedback. You are not giving me what i paid for, doesnt matter whether its a game, food or clothing. If its shit im betrayed and i can do whatever i want...people sue companies for millions of dolars for hurting customers or not delivering the product. Few people bitching on the forums is as harmless as it can get, actually. <br />
<br />
Think whatever you want but sub numbers show it clearly, they underestimated maturity of their players. Kids kept playing when it went down the hill since wotlk, always buying this &quot;they are working on next expansion&quot; crap, etc. Now majority are adults who actually give very nice feedback in form of sub losses. Some people are bitching but they are actually the only people who fight for YOU to have more content. People didnt demand shit in the past and it led to WoD. I like people bitching and writing game reviews, the more the competition thrives the more blizz has to deliver and therefore i can have more fun.<br />
<br />
Its only logical blizzards calls these people stupid crybabies, when customers ask for more bang for their buck it means you as a company get less profit. This is all its about. If you dont get it - god help you my friend.</div></div><hr />

More than likely they will - not because &quot;people will always whine&quot;, but because they are two different groups of people complaining.<br />
<br />
One thing is sure, I rather they create hype based on crap that will actually make it to the game, even if that means discussing less about those features during development time, than they creating hype out of thin air on stuff they just want to make and sound really fucking awesome.<br />
<br />
But let's face it, the latter will happen again and again - because that's what sells preorders. Hype everything, even what might get scrapped.</div></div><hr />

I did not say that, and I did not say they were flawless. They've fucked things up, and they still do on occasion. But to go from that to saying that they never do anything because they're lazy and just faff about all day long instead of making the game better is a BIG stretch.

It's annoying and sad.<br />
Grow up and realize that you aren't the center of the universe.<br />
<br />
And what's all this shit about 'I'm a costumer, therefore I deserve to get what I want'. That's not how the world works. In what industry do customers get what they want? Have you ever raged at a clothing manufacturer because they didn't produce the clothes you wanted? Or did you rage at Coca Cola because New Coke XY didn't taste as you expected? No, you didn't. You just don't buy a product if you don't like it. It should be the same with WoW. If you don't like where WoW is going just don't play it and look for something else in life. You are also free to give feedback in the hopes that in the future you get what you want. But they are not forced to do what you want them to. Raging certainly won't achieve anything.<br />

I like you. Incidentally, I completely agree.</div></div><hr />

If you read my first post again: lazy could be replaced by greedy activision. Less develepment cost = larger profit. Or are you telling me companys dont do that? No, allmost every commercial company does this! Thus thats what i was explaining. They remove intensive development to increase profit. The 1 year HFC really shows that (same with SOo and dragonsoul).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Look, if you are talking about your next product on an event to create hype, you know what you are doing, don't try to play the &quot;good guy&quot; here saying that you didn't promised this or that, if you present in a fking giant screen new features for a future expansion you are PRESENTING something, places like Gamescom or Blizzcon are not just places to talk about &quot;ideas&quot;, you go there to make announcements, if you want to talk about ideas then do a freaking blog like Ghostcrawler did back in the day (DevWatercooler) <br />
<br />
You can say that part of the &quot;community&quot; is stupid in terms of game development, and it's true, the same way that a lot of people in this world is stupid in terms of this thing or that because everyone is diferent and like diferent things, the key to solve this is just INFORMING people, if you give people information they will understand, but if you go to a big event, show a video and a powerpoint presentation ANNOUNCING X amount of features don't be surprised that people take that as a promise, because then explain me why should I be excited about anything you say if aparently every single thing that you show to me can be deleted.<br />
<br />
I'm personaly done with the &quot;we could have done better&quot; excuse, the first time I was like...okay I get it, it's the first time you fucked up, don't worry...but they have been doing the same thing for so long now, they just don't learn, they do something wrong and instead of just talking with us apologizing for the mistakes, they just say... &quot;well, we could have done better&quot; of course you could, but I would love to hear an explanation about why you didn't better.</div></div><hr />

Have you ever raged at a clothing manufacturer because they didn't produce the clothes you wanted? <br />
<br />
Actually there are such policies in a lot of industries. The clothing for example is called tailoring, you go to a tailor you tell them what you want and they'll make it for you with your choices of color and material and height and width. Since it's custom made, it's going to cost a ton more than your regular stuff from the shelf, but yeah..<br />
Same thing in software development, customer companies order a thing that they are paying for from a software company or a website for their business. That company makes the website to their desire and layout. I hear this daily from my friends who work at software companies, their customers requiring features for a website etc, the devs might not want to do them or don't know how, but they are getting paid and eventually their bosses say, find a way and they find a way. The devs might hate that but are getting paid for it. At least that's what my friends usually complain, that customers are idiots, but they want it that way so it gets done that way, hence the saying that customers are always right.<br />
I myself work in construction industry in architecture to be precise. We design hospitals, we get constant feedback from nurses and doctors where some walls should be, what furniture should be where and what color. The hospital pays our bills of designing, we can always give ideas and suggestions cause we have the experience and are professionals in the design department, but in the end we do what customer or in this case the employees of the hospital want cause they're the ones using the things daily after they've been built. If they want a shortcut deposit hatch there, they'll get it, if there's nothing important stopping placing it there etc. Or if it's expensive to do, we present the desired feedback to the board commitee of the hospital who decides on money and then they explain to the employees if something can't be done cause it's over the budget.<br />
<br />
Okay that would be a lot harder to implement in a game with 5 million subscribing players to please individuals, but one way could be to actually poll what the community wants and is willing to pay extra for, if it doesn't break the game. Let's say a dance studio (just off the top of my head, first not the best example) for example if asked and 2 million players would pay _extra_ to get this feature, why not do it? If there's like 5 people who would want it at that point, maybe pass then, that's where the money comes to play if it's worth it.<br />
Game development is more of an art from like music or movies, but it's more interactive than those. A band plays the music they play and people buy the record if they like it, but games are more two way street, they are not exactly like companies working for companies like above, but they aren't that band doing one particular genre music either. The graphical artists and story writers are more like those bands that keep their genre going, they have the artistic eye for their craft, but the practical features in a game are more like the hospital workers above, they use the features daily. They are the ones who want to see things they use daily working as intended.<br />
<br />
Granted the community is not the greatest either. I can't say that i'm a game developer myself, i've studied it but not gratuated, but i have nearly a dozen close friends who are. Some work for bigger corporations and they have budgets that limit their resources, hence money is the limit what they can make and cannot make. Technology.. sure to some extinct, but if you're announcing (still not promising) a feature to major public, at this point you should have done at least some research that the technology is not a problem. If you go to press conference with a concept picture on power point and not anything researched or done and say this is coming, start to work on it next week and figure out it's in no way possible unless you can split an atom to 4 particles, yeah.. that's on you. Some of my friends are indie developers they do it for the love of gaming and games, most of these do it for free on their free time, and their games are not limited by the funding, only time. Why do these games get a lot of feedbacked and pre-announced (not promised) features, whilst the bigger corps who are dependant on funding of stock holders have to cut back on features? Thing is it might take them 4 years to implement it, but it still in there, where as people who are funded straight out scrap stuff, to not be done ever. <br />
<br />
I get that the money is the issue and motivator when you're not just doodling in your basement. But with the money in the picture also comes a certain responsibility as professionals to understand what the limits are. Specially if you got years of experience and in the leader department know what the team can and cannot deliver. I'm not saying don't push those limits, of course evolve, but don't go public with experimental stuff, use back channels for that. And people and customers should understand that twitter etc are not official channels for announced features, it's exactly that feedback and conversation method, specially coming from individual developers, not through the official company twitter for example. If that's confusing what is official, why aren't the companies marking with huge block letters sections that are for experimental stuff and back channels of discussion to get feedback? Like a section of forums that is titled: Not announced and NOT promised possible features. Where devs or community managers talk to customers about their wishes or the devs own visions and plans that are not restricted by tos or some beta agreement. In that way people are stupid they take twitter as official source for example, cause it doesn't say that NOT promised features on top of it. People may not want to be told they are stupid, but that doesn't mean they aren't. Make those channels public and known, if it's some dark corner of reddit and half the people on the player base doesn't know what the word reddit even means, yeah you're going to keep getting those angry messages via twitter.<br />
<br />
One point i'd like to present here, if game devs don't want to get called out on not delivering &quot;promised&quot;/announced content, why announce it in the first place? For example Blizzard that announces a lot of big features at Blizzcon, why are they announcing, hyping, demoing or even powerpointing features like Dance studio, Path of Titans etc at blizzcon if they are not 100% confirmed content. They are ideas that might get done, don't promote them at all, until they are confirmed. No one can then say you promised this, if you don't talk about them. Why is there any mention about a thing that gets some people hyped if it's not guaranteed to be in? Marketing hype, two words. Initial hype and word of mouth has been started, then back down and say things were not promised only announced. Just announce that this expansion will have raids and pvp tier and 5mans and quests just like every expansion before since those are guaranteed. It's not that hard, yeah the hype probably isn't going to be that big, but at least that's telling the truth and not having to go back about what we said and when we said. When customers are at Blizzcon waiting on new info they don't want to hear about things that might or might not be in the next expansion, specially if you're 6 months from launch. Again i'm not a game dev, but i'm pretty sure you are not starting to make a new continent or zone for release day 6 months before release, that's highly likely done, might be missing textures or fine tuning, but the basis are there and working.<br />
<br />
For example the Legion announcement contained Artifact weapons and Demon Hunters in a large scale to be main features. If the expansion is released in 6 months and artifact weapons are scrapped during that. Then saying we didn't promise that to begin with we showed a concept of what might be..<br />
Why not just have the annoucement, we are going to have demon hunters and 2 new raids, that's it in the first place, cause those were already designed and 100% sure to be in the game, the end. Then on release if artifacts are ready and will be done for sure, announce that a month or week before release, like hey btw this is also going be in and we know that now.<br />
<br />
Discussing about possible features or might be features is okay and encouraged, but don't powerpoint that in your companys main announcement channel like Blizzcon if it's not sure. In my opinion that's pretty official or as official as it can get, you have the most media coverage possible at that particular time. <br />
Do the feedback and and discussion on forums, polls, or things dedicated to it, not as advertisement by marketing staff.<br />
Good example the Path of Titans that was powerpointed at Blizzcon in the main expac announcement, why was that there if you weren't 100% sure? <br />
Could have left it out, just saying. Nobody would have been any wiser. Then write a topic to reddit or whatever about it after launch that &quot;yeah we had this planned, but it didn't happen we cut it out&quot;. &quot;Any thoughts should we focus this a main feature for next expac and start working on it and finish it before the announcement?&quot;<br />
Things may not say promised feature at Blizzcon, but they also don't say this is just a concept or idea we are toying with.<br />
Blizzcon is just a culminated example, since it's pretty much the biggest yearly press conference of the company, don't bring concepts or far in-development things to the main presentation. At first announcement customers want to get hyped about things that are guaranteed to be playable, not hypothetical things.</div></div><hr />

This community is just growing worse and worse. A bunch of self-entitled Millennials that haven't reached anything in life think they know everything better than professionals. It's annoying and sad.<br />
Grow up and realize that you aren't the center of the universe.<br />
<br />
And what's all this shit about 'I'm a costumer, therefore I deserve to get what I want'. That's not how the world works. In what industry do customers get what they want? Have you ever raged at a clothing manufacturer because they didn't produce the clothes you wanted? Or did you rage at Coca Cola because New Coke XY didn't taste as you expected? No, you didn't. You just don't buy a product if you don't like it. It should be the same with WoW. If you don't like where WoW is going just don't play it and look for something else in life. You are also free to give feedback in the hopes that in the future you get what you want. But they are not forced to do what you want them to. Raging certainly won't achieve anything.<br />
<br />
In what world can you invest hundreds if not thousands of hours of time and dollars/euros into a product like coca cola or cloths? And no one ever build up social connections/communities over drinking a coke. <br />
At least coca cola is smart enough to not change a winning recipe.<br />

The clothing for example is called tailoring, you go to a tailor you tell them what you want and they'll make it for you with your choices of color and material and height and width. Since it's custom made, it's going to cost a ton more than your regular stuff from the shelf, but yeah..<br />
<br />
Well that's all well and good when making a product aimed at a single person.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Who the fuck cares if that's the truth or not?<br />
<br />
<br />
They allways come with the same bullshit.<br />
<br />
Look, if you are talking about your next product on an event to create hype, you know what you are doing, don't try to play the &quot;good guy&quot; here saying that you didn't promised this or that, if you present in a fking giant screen new features for a future expansion you are PRESENTING something, places like Gamescom or Blizzcon are not just places to talk about &quot;ideas&quot;, you go there to make announcements, if you want to talk about ideas then do a freaking blog like Ghostcrawler did back in the day (DevWatercooler) <br />
<br />
You can say that part of the &quot;community&quot; is stupid in terms of game development, and it's true, the same way that a lot of people in this world is stupid in terms of this thing or that because everyone is diferent and like diferent things, the key to solve this is just INFORMING people, if you give people information they will understand, but if you go to a big event, show a video and a powerpoint presentation ANNOUNCING X amount of features don't be surprised that people take that as a promise, because then explain me why should I be excited about anything you say if aparently every single thing that you show to me can be deleted.<br />
<br />
I'm personaly done with the &quot;we could have done better&quot; excuse, the first time I was like...okay I get it, it's the first time you fucked up, don't worry...but they have been doing the same thing for so long now, they just don't learn, they do something wrong and instead of just talking with us apologizing for the mistakes, they just say... &quot;well, we could have done better&quot; of course you could, but I would love to hear an explanation about why you didn't better.<br />

Most MMOs that come out, from what I've seen, are almost surprises with their patches and expansions. Most games get a few trailers and interviews at places like E3 and Gamescom, but outside of those interviews there's no real communication between consumer and creator.<br />
<br />
<br />
Blizzard's more communicative with their playerbase than the average company and the LEAST people can do in return is be understanding enough not to give them shit when plans change or features don't make it into the game. Feel upset, criticize, whatever, but don't act like you were entitled to what they initially announced. Not to say Warlord's wasn't disappointing, but it's not like it was a conscious decision to cause the development problems that led to it being what it is.</div></div><hr />

I'm not defending WoD, no one can defend that shit. <br />
<br />
But what I can defend is general game design &amp; people who are passionate about it &amp; actually understand it. While WoW's community has turned into a self entitlement circle jerk that is mainly clueless about anything on what game design is. Now did Blizzard fuck up talking about those things early, damn right they did. But still people think anything shown even a concept is a promise. &quot;This is an idea of something we would like to do&quot; I don't get how that is this &quot;We promise you this&quot;.<br />
<br />
But for the sake of WoD they litterally said things they shouldn't have, but what I used a abovie is a generalization.<br />

One dungeon (the second Abyssal Maw dungeon) and one raid instance (the Firelands) originally announced at Blizzcon 2009 will not be happening on release, though they will likely appear later:<br />

I honestly don't. I do however see how features such as the Dance Studio which even showed up in the announcement trailer for WotlK can be read that way. Anything from panels and discussions are ideas and concepts until they are implemented.

Or how they sunk a bunch of money in a video game movie which has its own stigmas attached to it being a video game movie of a game thats well past it's popularity peak which deals with events that's most wow players or fans are not familiar with so we get WoD to remind us as a cheap rushed movie tie-in.<br />

Has everyone forgotten the WoD announcement at Blizzcon? We were told that the development for WoD at that time was well ahead of where they were at the same point for MoP. So saying &quot;too much&quot; in that context seems legit since WoD was almost done baking. <br />
<br />
I'm interested in what happened at Blizzard between that Blizzcon and the eventual (and very late) release of WoD.

You could read the quotes right there in the post, about how there's a small space between being wanting feedback on a feature and being able to change it, plus the part where an expansion is already halfway done. But reading is for suckers, right?<br />

You could argue that WotLK was the best expansion because there were most subscribers back then.

<br />
This silly coca cola argument has been making its rounds of the forums, and I constantly point this out. If WoW had never developed any new features after WotLK and just added new raids and zones, it would have gotten incredibly stale and people would have quit even faster. People can enjoy the same food and beverages because food is very different from entertainment.<br />
<br />
People point to wrath because it was the peak subs before the decline, and yet WoW is following the very typical product adoption curve. Nothing could have stopped the decline once WoW reached its peak, and it's clear that wrath was that peak. Anyone left who hadn't WoW joined in wrath to down the biggest baddie the warcraft universe had really seen up to that point. People had a grudge to settle with Arthas from Warcraft 3, and after Arthas died there was really no lore character left that people &quot;wanted&quot; to kill. Deathwing was meh because his only story existed in lore books, which 95% of players never even bothered to read, whereas most had played WC3.</div></div><hr />

People don’t really understand game development, but think they do<br />
It’s really really easy to be an armchair game developer.<br />
The general public is never going to have access to all of the information that the developers with which to make their decisions.<br />
Gamers really don’t understand game development any more than diners understand how a restaurant is actually run.<br />
Most gamers out there don't really care about the nitty-gritty of game development. They just want to know that the game they want is going to have the features that they want.<br />
<br />
<br />
- if the job is to hard for some of your employess fire them and hire competent people - maybe you current staff will be happier serving burgers in mcdonas if they lack skills for programmin<br />
-you dont have to have 100% information to see in what direction game is heading often 5 % is more then enough to see product as faulty<br />
-ye right ofc they dont - its all magic and small dwarfs runing both programming companies and restaurants<br />
-as well as al customers all over the world - nobody is interested in creation everybody cares only about effect - if you employess are ineffective in any industire what do you do ? you fire them and hire more competent people</div></div><hr />

If anything the more silent Blizzard is a direct result of just how incredibly terrible the WoW community is. They can literally not share a thought without people throwing themselves over it.<br />
<br />
And you know who was terrible to GC? Not the average wow player - they don't visit the forums often, if at all. I was in a guild of 300 people at the time, me and one other person read the forums.<br />
<br />
The people who were terrible to GC were the &quot;Mr. Hardcore&quot; raiders and wannabe raiders. The same ones who have been running their mouths about EVERYTHING here, on the Bliz site, on Reddit, attacking anything that isn't raiding. They created the toxic community online and in the game. PUGs are bad because of people who don't play well? No, they're toxic because of the assholes running their mouths about &quot;bads&quot; and holding content hostage to soothe their flammable little egos. <br />
<br />
And now, they're pointing their greasy little fingers at everyone who wasn't on the forums running their mouths, accusing THEM of being toxic. It's perfect. They're perfect assholes. They rise to the challenge of refining the definition of &quot;asshole&quot; at every opportunity. They're doing a bang up job in this thread. <br />
<br />
&quot;Everyone is a just a toxic crybaby blah blah blah&quot; - this coming from people who endlessly whine about LFR. <br />
<br />
Well, I think the inevitable will happen - everyone who isn't a toxic Raider wannabe asshole with a big mouth will leave, and that's all that will be left - a group of concentrated antisocial assholes who never learned to share. Have fun! (While it lasts) <br />

<br />
Players shouldn't have to. Players don't NEED to know, to be able to enjoy a game, and to not enjoy a game. If I buy a movie, and it's bad, I don't sit there and say &quot;Well, movie making is hard&quot;. Fuck that. It's a bad product, and it's on the studio for putting it out.<br />
<br />
This blame game is hilarious - and even more hilarious after months of &quot;constructive criticism only, please&quot; from the bootlickers in the forums. It's not our fucking job to fix the game. Complaining or criticizing something does not come with a responsibility to fix the flaws. It's on the creator, that's a basic, eons old truth, in any expressive medium. <br />
<br />
It's even more hilarious when a creative team is given MONTHS of feedback, and it's ignored, and now the flaws are OUR fault, because we're not game designers? I have to have 8 years working experience to say Garrisons are a big, stinking greasy turd plopped into the middle of a game? <br />
<br />
Yeah. I'm not a gave developer. And I don't need to be one to buy a fucking game. I dealt with that elitist bullshit in college, with the final art douchebags running around sneering that if you didn't understand their &quot;art&quot;, it's because you weren't good enough. Enough of this inner-circle bullshit - if you release games to the general public you need to be a game designer to understand, then you've failed as a game designer. Period. <br />

Warlords of Dreanor is a pile of shit. There, I said that as a non-game designer, call the white knight police! <br />

<br />
Kinda what I read out of that. <br />
<br />
The problem is that, if they keep telling us that something is going to be in an expansion, why WOULDN'T players expect it to be there? If it's uncertain, SAY it's uncertain. There's nothing wrong with that! But if you're trying to sell a product like expansion pre-orders and you tell them something will be in it, and that something ends up not being in it. In fact, if you cut MOST of what you say will be in it, that's false advertising. With most other products, I can get a refund for that. Warlords of Draenor was not the expansion people paid for well ahead of time. We were told it would cost more because it had more content, and that turned out to be a bunch of bovine excrement. And their justification for that is... &quot;It's all the customer's fault for expecting us to deliver the things we said we'd deliver.&quot; Really?!?!<br />
<br />
I dropped my sub months ago. I have 5 days left on all my prepaid time, and I haven't played in at least a month. I vowed after nearly 10 years of a non-lapsing sub, many store purchases, many CE preorders, and Blizzcon tickets that I wasn't sending them another dime unless I'd seen the product first and I knew what was in it and it was what I wanted. I see nothing in any of this to change my stance on this company, and I'm pretty darn sure I'm not the only one. I keep an eye on them because I'm hopeful, but I've just about given up on a company I once loved. It's a shame.</div></div><hr />

The hilarious part is they're going to go through another round of this with all the shit they revealed at Gamescom.

<br />
I woke up, made some coffee, did some emails, and came here, and was astounded with what they posted.

Hey look at that, he summed up 70% of the forum community in one sentence.<br />
<br />
70% of the forum community get upset when they're sold a product and don't get what they paid for? How utterly fucking unreasonable.<br />
<br />
If the devs SAY something will be IN THE FUCKING EXPANSION THAT COSTS LOTS OF MONEY, then you're damn right people expect it to be there. I don't understand how the fuck people actually think that's somehow entitled or whiny? Maybe when you're spending your parents' money, getting the product you were advertised doesn't really matter to you, but when people are spending fucking $60 of their own money the devs shouldn't be LYING.</div></div><hr />

They are the ones who created a horrible expansion. If they had at least attempted to make a good game this time around do they think there would be so much anti-blizzard sentiment?

<br />
It's not even the whole &quot;promised&quot; thing. I played WOD, and I made it two weeks before I unsubbed in disgust. I felt ripped off at how short and meagre the end game was, considering I went in already decided that I wasn't going to raid, or bother with the legendary because it was obviously designed for raiders, and I don't need it. <br />
<br />
I made an adult decision based on my own experience, and that is completely ignored, dismissed and belittled by the guys who made it. A couple million people agreed with me, and did the same. But oh, we don't pay attention to subs. Riiiiight. <br />
<br />
This dev team doesn't know what it's doing. Period. It's blatantly clear, the visionaries who made the game great, who didn't get into pissing matches with the players, who didn't oversell and under deliver, who's names are not on the box anymore, are a loss they'll never recover from. <br />
<br />
I accept it. I won't spend money on this dev team's output anymore, and I'm okay with that. The squabbling and attacking and white knighting in the forums here indicate there are a lot of people who can't, or won't reach that conclusion - and that's fine, too. I don't have to share an instance with them anymore, they're Blizzard's problem. All these white knights and raiders and wanna be raiders who are parroting &quot;toxic&quot; furiously today, in 6 months will be crying louder and harder than the people they're accusing - especially if raid content is cut, or they rehash an old raid.<br />

<br />
Which is absolutely wrong.. an accessible community can't be a bad thing in a million years, but an inaccessible one is. CM nowadays got their mouth tighten up, unlike the time of GC which CM took feedbacks, insults, complains and blames. CM today doesn't say anything at all, because they think by avoiding saying something wrong, they can ALWAYS BE RIGHT, man, that's the stupidest idea for PR policy can ever generate.<br />
<br />
Yeah, so Blizzard think like this&quot;players bitching all the time about what I say and what I don't say, what I promise and what I don't promise, what I do and what I don't do, they are all bunch of jerks rioting all the time. I must end this bullshit by saying nothing at all, I must shut the CM up, being absolutely untouchable so people won't get me wrong and I shall always be right.&quot; The last time I check, that's called DICTATORSHIP&quot;<br />
<br />
I think Blizzard somehow being really afraid of player-base, they would shit in their pants if they had told players WoD would be a facebook game with only two tiers before WoD release, 'cause if they had done that, nobody would ever pre-oder Warlords of Shit. Players are fooled, cheated by blatant lies about game contents as they have fucking no clue that WoD would be cut down so much into a triviality.<br />
<br />
You gotta understand, the only thing worse than &quot;communicating too much&quot; is communicating too little and Blizzard is exactly executing this &quot;talk less&quot; policy. They are frightened because every expansion is worse than the last one. Legion won't do any better, I can assure that, many features will be removed before it goes online so basically it's just WoD 2.0.<br />
<br />
The only thing can F wake Blizzard up is 3M sub gone in Q3.</div></div><hr />

That's not what was said. They said they did not realize there were problems with Garrisons until the expansion was half over, not the beta. If they'd acknowledged the problem in beta, they could have addressed it.<br />

<br />
It as if they have come to the conclusion that Warlords was bad only because the devs over-shared.<br />
<br />
No. Warlords came out of the gate being great... until you hit that first Heroic dungeon and the gear that dropped was just terribly low. How the hell does that happen 10 years into this game?<br />
<br />
Then Garrisons just became this time consuming waste of time.<br />
<br />
This was the Steam Early Access Expansion. They released a very front heavy expansion, they over-hyped it with all of their nonsense articles (player accessories anyone?), and they KNEW what they were doing.<br />
<br />
LFR- cheaper and easier to make than new dungeons and scenarios.<br />
Garrisons- cheaper and easier to make than new content- 6.1 was a total scam patch and they have all but admitted this now.<br />
Moving faction hub cities to Ashran- cheaper and easier than coming up with a good reason to get players to play in their new world pvp zone.<br />
<br />
I have hope in Legion. But there is a lot of comfortable managers on Team WoW. Yes- I am being a jerkface. Grow up. Business is business. Stop acting like children at your jobs. You are paid by us to create stuff we want. If we do not like what you are creating or believe you are acting like a sleazy electronic bait and switch shop, we are allowed to be A-holes about it.<br />
<br />
Couple flaws in your post. Hard to follow subscriber opinions because they're conflicting. For instance, the topic of flying or garrisons. Some hated one while others liked the other. Personally, I liked the garrison. It gave me a reason to log in when I would have just remained logged out until raid time.<br />
<br />
Dailies? Some people like it but I don't. I wouldn't log in to do dailies and I haven't done them after getting the pathfinder achieve. I just hate repetitive content, especially if it's forced in order to progress. This makes it a chore which would be no different than other people's take on garrisons.<br />
<br />
Devs going silent makes sense. Look at what happened this expansion. If Blizz never let the community know about Karabor, farahlon, multiple zone garrison placement, etc... then they could have cut stuff without the community knowing it was cut. The negative backlash is due to the fact that people get excited about something that will potentially be implemented in the game and then find out it won't be when it was never final to begin with. They want to be able to share their ideas without it being taken as gospel but the community takes it as gospel anyway and then crucifies them when it's not being given.<br />
<br />
The major flaws in WoD, from my perspective, is that they didn't deliver on the story more. They had a lot to work with but they didn't really deliver on it. Garrison campaigns was the only lore based end game stuff going on and that's it. They could have put in a quest line explaining the historical roots of Ashran, follow ups on the laughing skull clan (the fate of their clan and what they were up to. They were unheard of after gorgrond), etc... <br />
<br />
Questing was fun because it was the only dose of the lore you got and it was filled with cinematics at the end of a quest chain in every zone. Made you feel like you were building up to fight something great. It dropped off in end game as everything went silent or didn't have good flow. For instance, we have Gul'dan shackling Grom and assuming the throne as the villain but then we get into HFC and Grom plays zero role in anything. Basically, 'thanks for letting me out but now i'm just going to hack this corpse for the duration of the raid'. We had a full cinematic of the fate of how Grom got into that situation but then an anticlimactic resolution. Then we find out that Archimonde, who had little presence this xpac, is the end boss in HFC.<br />
<br />
I know Archimonde is probably an exciting boss to fight lorewise but it didn't really fit well. We literally see nothing of Archimonde except from a toy and now he's the last boss. I went into HFC unexcited for the lore behind it.</div></div><hr />

They should have a initial announcement that goes over everything that is confirmed and locked in.<br />
Then if they want, they can have 'watercool' or 'dev blogs' to talk about potential cool features or things they are trying to or want to add to the game.<br />
To get feedback and gauge the reactions. <br />
<br />
But they mix it all together, and people get this perception of what they game will/can be.<br />
Then they open the pre-sale options. <br />
<br />
To me that is dishonest. <br />
They should not be talking about things that can likely be cut when they are hyping the game for pre-sale.<br />
<br />
If they were honest about 2 raid tiers, and cutting Farahlon, there probably would have been a bunch of feedback on the price of the expansion.<br />
But no, they happened to be quiet about all that until the very last minute possible. (Announcing the new Xpac)</div></div><hr />

If you sell me a food in restaurant made of rotten ingredients that gives me stomach ache i dont politely give you my feedback. You are not giving me what i paid for, doesnt matter whether its a game, food or clothing. If its shit im betrayed and i can do whatever i want...people sue companies for millions of dolars for hurting customers or not delivering the product. Few people bitching on the forums is as harmless as it can get, actually. <br />
<br />
Think whatever you want but sub numbers show it clearly, they underestimated maturity of their players. Kids kept playing when it went down the hill since wotlk, always buying this &quot;they are working on next expansion&quot; crap, etc. Now majority are adults who actually give very nice feedback in form of sub losses. Some people are bitching but they are actually the only people who fight for YOU to have more content. People didnt demand shit in the past and it led to WoD. I like people bitching and writing game reviews, the more the competition thrives the more blizz has to deliver and therefore i can have more fun.<br />
<br />
Its only logical blizzards calls these people stupid crybabies, when customers ask for more bang for their buck it means you as a company get less profit. This is all its about. If you dont get it - god help you my friend.<br />
<br />
That's the problem, Blizzard sin't giving you rotten food. If I go to a restaurant and the steak is a over done, I eat it and then don't go back. Or I ask them politely to cook another, if possible. And usually, I'll go back and try again if I can think of a reasonable reason why the food wasn't good (Came at an off time, was very busy, ect.). If not, I don't throw it in the face of the server and then don't leave a tip. I treat other people with respect, and as a result, people don't tend to think I'm a flaming ass. <br />
<br />
Blizz tried something pretty radical with WoD and it didn't work out. THey tried to line up an expansion to match a movie which was jumped around by things outside of their control. They tried instead of a race or class to give us a home base which turned out to be a bit more dull then most of us would have liked. They tried keeping players on the ground for a longer period of time, but bad communication led people to feel like they were permanently grounded. <br />
<br />
They tried something. It didn't quite work out. I sent the expac back to the kitchen. I think Legion sounds a lot more interesting. I'll see how it goes, I think I might like it. If I don't, well, there's another place down the street. What I won't do is get on a forum like this and cry that people who put their all into this game don't care, or that they're stupid or anything else. That's not true and demeaning to people who have provided me with a lot of good times.</div></div><hr />

It's making a base assumption with absolutely no way to prove or disprove the statement, not stating it as a possible answer, and framing the person from Blizz as a bad guy first.<br />
<br />
That's Toxic. It makes people think much worse about the game than a dozen other explanations, but it makes this person feel superior. THAT is Toxic, and THAT is the kind of bull that hurts this community and this game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The point of a beta is to figure out if what they made FUNCTIONS or needs to be adjusted. A beta test is 100% not designed to figure out if a core system is &quot;fun.&quot; That should be figured out in testing and maybe in an alpha test. <br />
<br />
They gambled on the garrison thing and it did not work out the way they wanted. By the time it became clear what the potential issues were, it was way too late to do much more than a few tweaks. <br />
<br />
I believe garrisons could be good and fun with basically tweaks and some additional developments that never happened. It sounds like they are doing some of what I would have preferred in Legion. <br />
<br />
I also thing that the &quot;progress bar&quot; missions and the lack of compelling apexis rewards (somewhat addressed in 6.2) hurt the potential of garrisons. The invasion missions were kind of fun. If that had been a weekly unlockable &quot;dungeon&quot; that you could queue up for perhaps that could have been cool. Or a scenario where you do things like invade iron horde stronholds (basically a scenario just like &quot;And Justice for Thrall&quot; mission series in nagrand) that can only be unlocked by completing some garrison quests each week would have been cool too. <br />
<br />
It just needed a little more work to make it have a point. <br />
<br />
That cannot be done in a beta, especially when you are 14 months out from your last content patch.</div></div><hr />

That era will never be over as long Blizzard are blood sucking pre-orders and monthlfy fee. They don't feel confident that their current content can keep them. So they are asked to show previews to score pre-orders and score current monthly subcribers.<br />
And oh... the marketing team somehow has to do something to get their paychecks.</div></div><hr />

He needs to take the backseat and not be present for an expansion or two.<br />
<br />
I love Thrall. Hell, he's my phone backdrop. I can't wait to take his weapon. And yay for pretty much confirmation he isn't dying!<br />
<br />
He's gotta show up if for no other reason than to relinquish Doomhammer to Enhancement Shaman. He's one of Azeroth's greatest heroes. I'd be a giant gap to explain why he'd show up for Deathwing and Garrosh but not for a Legion Invasion.</div></div><hr />

They should have a initial announcement that goes over everything that is confirmed and locked in.<br />
Then if they want, they can have 'watercool' or 'dev blogs' to talk about potential cool features or things they are trying to or want to add to the game.<br />
To get feedback and gauge the reactions. <br />
<br />
But they mix it all together, and people get this perception of what they game will/can be.<br />
Then they open the pre-sale options. <br />
<br />
To me that is dishonest. <br />
They should not be talking about things that can likely be cut when they are hyping the game for pre-sale.<br />
<br />
If they were honest about 2 raid tiers, and cutting Farahlon, there probably would have been a bunch of feedback on the price of the expansion.<br />
But no, they happened to be quiet about all that until the very last minute possible. (Announcing the new Xpac)<br />
<br />
To quote the thing you just read: &quot;People don’t really understand game development, but think they do&quot;<br />
<br />
There is nothing &quot;confirmed and locked in&quot; in software until you're actually using it in production. There DEFINITELY isn't anything &quot;confirmed and locked in&quot; when you're announcing something a year out.</div></div><hr />

I would like to go back to the time-tried cycle but perhaps investigating new paths with the 'final patch' each expansion so that there is the odd things to do.

My personal opinion is if they had released Mythic Dungeons and Timewalking dungeons with the other fixes, Selfie cam and twitter integration they had in 6.1, then 6.1 would be rather fondly remembered.<br />
<br />
As it is, Mythic dungeons especially are kind of forgotten in the 6.2 shuffle.</div></div><hr />

And that's the point- creative folk like movie makers or Blizzard create a lot. Not everything can work - either it didn't quite do what they intended, or it wasn't feasible to work with lots of people, or It didn't really tell the story they wanted. So it gets cut. Sometimes that happens.<br />
<br />
But no one's yelling outside of Sony Pictures that they never showed that scene of Bruce Banner in the Arctic in the film, because that would have been so cool and they could have done so much with it, and Sony is obviously lazy bastards for not including it in the film but using it in the trailer because they're liars and they're never gonna watch another Marvel movie again, were they?</div></div><hr />

Except that when you pre-order a DVD or Blueray, chances are that by then you know what's in a movie. Even pre-purchasing tickets doesn't typically happen until the movie is finished.<br />

<br />
There's also a big difference between the way movie makers hype a film and the way developers hype a game for pre-order. While one or two scenes might make it into a trailer but not the film, you can almost bank on them being included on the DVD. You can also rest assured that when they're doing a Q&amp;A on the movie ahead of time that they won't be telling you a whole list of things it'll include only to cut about 3/4 of it. <br />
<br />
Yes, players expect some things to be cut. That happens. But developers presented a whole freaking slideshow presentation with pictures telling us what they had planned for this expansion. You can't turn around and then act indignant that players were expecting a good portion of it to end up in the game-- especially when there was never a clear &quot;No, we've cut it and will never put it in there&quot; from anyone. They told us we were paying more because we were getting more. We got less. Let's be honest. This was not a talk about things developers would like to add but would probably get cut. That wasn't the title of any of the presentations. The presentation was on WoD and what we could expect. It's more than a little dishonest to pretend like it was presented to players the entire time as if it these things were all just little more than wishful thinking.<br />
<br />
This was PR. It was a sales pitch to get people to pre-order and spend their money, and so they had to make it sound like they had lots of stuff to justify the higher price. Do you seriously think that if they'd marketed what they actually had that people would have spent so much money and returned to the game? Really? No, you don't think that, and neither did Blizzard-- which is why they used the more dishonest strategy. This is nothing new, of course. Advertisers do it all the time. But let's not pretend they're getting picked on for something they didn't do. <br />
<br />
We were hyped up on a new Mercedes, spent the money for a Mercedes, and then were given a Chevy sedan with no options a few months later. Now the dealer's telling us that technically we weren't promised the Mercedes. It was just the one they showed us in the brochure when we pre-ordered a car and is wondering why we're so upset.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wow! You were in a beta test 10 years ago? That's quite an achievement. <br />
<br />
If something is too easy or too grindy, you adjust some drop rates or damage numbers. You don't end up scrapping an entire zone or class or feature weeks before launch. They aren't going to drop an entire boss out of a raid because his fight is boring. <br />
<br />
If you want to make an argument that maybe you SHOULD then go ahead, but no one does and that isnt what a beta test is for. Its 100% to iron out bugs and issues with what was built. Period.<br />
<br />
What's hilarious is that you are clearly exactly the kind of player that would CRUCIFY them for delaying a launch or removing a feature because it turned out that it was either so broken or so unfun that it was unacceptable to roll it out.</div></div><hr />

They shared too soon? No, there is still less content than there was before. Sure the quests are better, but what good are awesome quests when you still spend the most time with endgame that sucks and there is just not enough of it. I am not angry becazse I have to be, this is actually the first expansion I am angry about and I played since Wotlk was released, pretty weird huh? The dailies in MoP were terrible, but I still kind of enjoyed them in the end, because of the reward, it felt really hard earned. I still hate one thing.. the lack of changes to the outer world. Why they just can't do few changes to it every expansion, it would give the world feel. Repair Stormwind a little add some conflict somewhere, I think it would be cool if we actually had to use some of older resources for some profession recipes, not way too much though. It would send players through the world. Why every time we find new ore it must be better than the old one, it doesn't make sense and it makes all the previous ores obsolete. I think it could work, but I can feel the hate already.</div></div><hr />

I like that. Partially at fault of the game taking a dump are sites like this. Releasing all the information ever. You know exactly what you're getting. You don't get a new patch or expansion with anything unknown. You know the maps, the spells, the dungeons, the bosses, the loot, the rotation, all of the new features...everything. There is no excitement. Yup, that dungeon was exactly how it was on Fatboss preview. Time to go play battlefield. <br />
<br />
IMO Blizzard, don't release any info. Make it exciting again. Peddling info to whiney kids who just gotta know everything so they can bitch about it. Just make your game, spew some finer points of an expansion and leave it be. Then again, MMO champ will datamine everything and show it off anyways.</div></div><hr />
