On November 3 at the World of Warcraft Q&amp;A at BlizzCon 2018, players questioned panelists Alex Afrasiabi, Ion Hazzikostas, John Hight, and Chris Robinson. Many of the questions deserved a bit more time to fully answer than we originally anticipated, and in the end, eight attendees were left without the chance to ask their questions. Here are the questions that didn’t make it in time, along with our answers to each:<br />
<br />
Over the course of the last 14 years, we've killed many Warcraft villains. What is your strategy for introducing new characters and threats to this universe?<br />
<br />
While many of the iconic villains in WoW over the years were first established in the RTS games (Illidan, Arthas, etc.), WoW has been introducing new characters and threats since its earliest days (such as Onyxia or the Defias). We’re keenly aware of the need to begin building up future threats even as we confront existing ones. A major villain shouldn’t come out of nowhere and be a surprise. We plan our expansions out far in advance, so that we can begin foreshadowing and weaving narrative threads to connect them. Garrosh Hellscream is an example of a character born within WoW and built up to eventually become a major villain and then a catalyst that led directly to Azeroth’s confrontation with the Burning Legion. If you look carefully, there are seeds that have been planted and clues that point to who central foes might be in the future.<br />
<br />
When will the WoW Mobile App ever be complete? <br />
<br />
If you mean “complete” in the sense of integrating the social features currently missing from the app, like guild/community chat and the calendar, that’s actively being worked on and we’re aiming to get that functionality added in the coming months. Due to some tech infrastructure changes in Battle for Azeroth, we had to basically rebuild the existing Companion App from the ground up, but we’ll end up with a more robust foundation as a result.<br />
<br />
Do you have plans to make more reputation rewards account-wide?<br />
<br />
We feel that it’s important for characters to retain a certain element of distinct progression. Part of making an alt can be having a fresh set of goals and rewards to pursue once you’re starting to run out of accessible goals on your main, so we don’t make reputation globally account-wide. But some players feel compelled to re-earn reputations in a way that’s frustrating and we want to do what we can to help alleviate their specific concerns. We’re addressing some of that in Tides of Vengeance:<br />
<br />
<br />
Transmog appearances that have rep requirements will be unlocked account-wide once earned. You won’t need to re-earn a specific reputation on an alt if you want to use their tabard as part of your outfit.<br />
The achievements that require a certain number of Exalted reputations will now aggregate progress across your entire account.<br />
For Champions of Azeroth rep, access to the item level upgrades for the Heart of Azeroth will be account-wide. If you have at least one Revered character, any other fresh 120 alts can go visit Magni and collect all 45 item levels’ worth of upgrades right away.<br />
<br />
<br />
What can you tell us about your future plans for pet battles? <br />
<br />
Pet battles continue to be a fun system layered on top of the core WoW experience. As we introduce new zones and content, there will be new pets to tame or earn as reward. For players who are looking for a new challenge to overcome, we’re adding a new Gnomeregan pet battle dungeon in Tides of Vengeance. Beyond that, in the long-term, we’d like to take a fresh look at “PvP” pet battles to see if we can add a more structure to that system and elevate it beyond what is currently a niche pursuit.<br />
<br />
Will gear ever return to the way it used to be with no warforging and titanforging? <br />
<br />
That’s unlikely.<br />
<br />
Gear used to be only available from a handful of activities, such as raiding or rated PvP. Obtaining a specific piece of gear could be a months-long pursuit. As the quantity and variety of sources of gear increased over the years, increasingly the pacing of rewards wasn’t matching the pacing of the activity itself. By Mists of Pandaria, a guild progressing through a raid zone over the course of a couple of months could reach a point where they were fully equipped with gear from that tier, before having finished the zone. Lacking individual motivation or excitement about rewards when raiding, even if the encounters themselves were still fun, meant a lack of continued progression for the group. If you were stuck on Sha of Fear, there was no real expectation that your group would get any stronger week over week to help you overcome that hurdle. That gave rise to Thunderforging as a system in Patch 5.2, which evolved into the system we know today.<br />
<br />
We like that Warforging preserves a sense of possibility to most encounters, and it allows a group’s overall item level to continue to increase steadily. It also creates moments of surprise and excitement across all types of players and activities. Of course, we understand that when an exceptionally lucky player gets a perfect Titanforged item from a Raid Finder boss, that can feel like it undermines Mythic content, but ultimately, that’s just a single piece of gear. Overall, the Mythic raider will be better-geared than the Normal or Heroic raider, even if the latter gets lucky once. We restrict the ability of pieces like weapons or Azerite armor to Titanforge, and we’ve reduced the chance of extreme Titanforging in BfA. We used to see players who felt obligated to run content they’d outgeared just for a chance at lucky upgrades, and we now see far less of this behavior.<br />
<br />
Players will always want to use the best traits on Azerite gear for every situation. Why punish the player with a big gold cost to reforge? <br />
<br />
We draw a distinction between items and character attributes like spec or talents. Usually you can’t change the former at all, or there’s a destructive process involved like replacing a gem or enchantment, or Artifact Relic in Legion. A healer trinket is a healer trinket, and can’t be morphed into a tank trinket if you want to switch from Holy to Prot. If you want to perform at a given level in both specs, you need separate trinkets of similar quality for each.<br />
<br />
However, we’re mindful of feedback we’d gotten regarding spec flexibility. We want Azerite armor to be flexible, so that you could switch from Fire to Frost if you want to, or you could switch from Arms to Protection for a week if your raid’s tank was absent. Without some friction, the system would just turn into a secondary (and awkward) set of talents, and a mere cooldown could create situations where you switched from one trait to another, and then couldn’t go back at all without having to wait. We ultimately settled on a respec cost that started out very low (5 gold) and increased and decayed rapidly, such that periodic respecs would be essentially free, but swapping back and forth routinely would be unsustainable.<br />
<br />
Nonetheless, mistaken choices or experimentation can quickly spiral out of control and leave even occasional respecs feeling overly costly. In Tides of Vengeance, we’ll be doubling the rate at which the respec cost decays, so it will go down by 50% every 24 hours. Additionally, given the changes to several Azerite traits and the new ones coming with the update, we’ll provide a one-time reset of all respec costs when the update goes live.<br />
<br />
How will you motivate Mythic Raiders to raid, when Mythic Keystone gear can titanforge to such high item levels? <br />
<br />
Aside from prestigious titles and cosmetic rewards, Mythic raiding remains one of the most reliable sources of high-end gear in the game, with more ability to target specific pieces via bonus rolls and trading. It’s no coincidence that the best-geared players in the game are, almost without exception, Mythic raiders who also do other types of endgame content. Historically, raiding was the only way to get the best gear in the game, but our goal today is to provide parallel endgame item progression paths for different playstyles (raiding, dungeons, competitive PvP) to reward skill, dedication, and organization in various forms. Ideally, each of those paths also offers some unique benefits that set it apart from the others.<br />
<br />
How to you plan to accommodate new players who are overwhelmed by the size of the content?<br />
<br />
On one hand, the breadth and depth of World of Warcraft is one of the game’s strengths. A new player entering Azeroth gets access to fourteen years of content, with entire worlds to explore and stories to unravel. But that same content can also be a daunting. Including a character boost with our recent expansions is one way of making sure that players can always leap directly into the latest and greatest content, but that’s far from a complete solution.<br />
<br />
We’re taking a fresh look at our new player experience, with the goal of making it better reflect the quality and scope of the modern game. That’s a long-term project, but it’s an essential one as many brand-new players try out WoW for the first time every way, and we want to make sure we’re welcoming them into Azeroth and really showing off everything that is awesome about World of Warcraft.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thank you all very much for taking the time to participate in the Q&amp;A. It was amazing to see so many players come to the Darkmoon Faire and submit questions (and sometimes, comments) for the development team. We read every single one of them, and we really enjoyed talking with everyone we could in Anaheim.</div></div><hr />

It ruins my sense of progression. You didn't do normal/heroic in WoD and have it TF to Mythic levels thereby negating the enjoyment of getting that item in Mythic. I don't WANT to get something that makes it so I never have to replace that til the next tier, I play this game for the gear treadmill, I love replacing things. Getting a 385 in Normal just hurts my soul (even just one piece). Ever since they added TF I've had to switch characters constantly because I run out of things that need upgrades (and I'm not talking BiS, I don't chase that shit, I'm just talking meaningful upgrades). Major part of all this isn't even TF though, it's that gear is just too abundant, you walk into a raid almost outgearing it (I don't do the top top end anymore, but am more the capable of doing high M+ when I feel like it, which is seldom this expansion)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nicode</div><div class="date">2018-11-16, 09:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What really grinds my gears about titanforging is how every time they are asked about it, they trot out that old bullshit straw man of the &quot;LFR raider who got one piece of mythic gear&quot; as if that's the main problem that players have with the system. The real problem most players (including myself) have with titanforging is that: <br />
<br />
(1) it's the RNG gear treadmill taken to the unhealthy far extreme <br />
(2) it makes knowing the best gear for your character nearly impossible without constant simming <br />
(3) leaves players feeling bad about &quot;upgrades&quot; when they really aren't upgrades at all<br />
(4) destroys the goals -&gt; progression -&gt; accomplishment core loop of an RPG<br />
<br />
But of course Ion never talks about these, because he doesn't want to expose the obvious flaws in the system. Instead he pretends it's all about irrational jealousy, so that he can lawyer it away. <br />
<br />
There's NOTHING wrong with a character feeling as if they've reached a pinnacle of gearing for the current tier. In fact, this is A GOOD THING because it provides a realistic goal and a sense of accomplishment. If they really wanted to &quot;preserve a sense of possibility to most encounters&quot; then they could just leave it at 5-10 ilvl warforge with a chance at tertiary stats and/or a socket, but the truth is that they WANT players to be stuck on the treadmill for the entire expansion with no hope of finishing it.<br />
<br />
Fuck titanforging. It's ruined raiding, it's ruined alts, and it's ruined progression.</div></div><hr />

Treat it as a bonus, a small help towards beating that awesome Mythic boss, who will give you even BETTER gear. When you treat it as a bonus this mentality simply dies. People scream and rage and shout and yell as if it happened 100% of the time. Truth is Blizzard has said this this strange behaviour has died down thanks to lowering the chance for it to happen. It's just a bonus. /shrug</div></div><hr />

It's not as bad TF this expansion, since it seems they did nerf the frequency, but good lord was it too high in Legion. But TF isn't truly even the problem, like I said in my edit, their entire gearing system is fucked. I walked into heroic uldir needing almost no pieces (I don't have any desire to do mythic anymore), this never happened before Legion, and that's not even TF, they just give you TOO MUCH gear.</div></div><hr />

All in your head. If you can't enjoy something, because something better exists, then...well, I actually don't have a single clue what to tell you, because that kind of jealousy and selfishness is so alien to me. <br />

You read that completely wrong. It's not because something better EXISTS it's because I get something equal to it in the lower difficulty which negates my want to even bother with the higher. If you get a 370 piece in normal, why bother trying to get it in heroic? They should have stuck with the +6 from wod.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because doing heroic will get you other 370 pieces you may need along with TF pieces, which will in turn aid you in moving towards mythic and so on. I don't get what's wrong. The loot treadmill is there, the incentive to do higher difficulties is there, the chance for TF to happen is LOW. I've done Uldir since it came out every week, only got ONE TF piece. ONE.<br />
<br />
I suggest Diablo 3 for a rough treadmill since that it what people with this mentality seem to want. Perhaps WoW is not the game for these people anymore.</div></div><hr />

How are you that ignorant? People don't like it because it's artificial RNG to keep us subbed longer. Also it creates systems like Raider.io and the like. Any idiot can have 370 gear score without barely putting any effort into it. People don't want to M+ with them cause they're just not very good. So Raider. io gets created, in the past we'd use ilvl as an indicator as to how good you are, with WF and TF being so insane now, you just can't not have a system like io with Bli$$ard giving away high ilvl gear like candy. <br />
<br />
Also, how is it fun to get a huge upgrade? Most of the time when you get gear, it's not WF or TF, so guess what? It doesn't feel as good. Getting the Mythic 2h Mace on Taloc was great, at first. Then I noticed the other warrior in the raid who got a 395ilvl 2h mace. GREAT FUN AMIRITE? <br />

Okay, you've quit. But imagine the thousands who play this game as if it were a slot machine (gambling problem much?) that keep playing because of the RNG just for a fraction of a tiny chance to get an upgrade, then complain that Blizzard does this to 'artificially extend sub time'. Guess what, the problem is these people's mentality who treat this game as their gambling fix, and not the game's design. <br />
<br />
Regarding getting huge upgrades: you treat WF or TF as the standard instead of what it is... A BONUS. Then your friend gets this BONUS and you get mad because you didn't get the same BONUS. If anything, you should be mad at the laws of chance, instead of the game or your friend. What you feel there is not hate against the design, it is JEALOUSY. &quot;He got an upgrade and I didn't! TERRIBLE SYSTEM!&quot; Calm down and carry on.</div></div><hr />

To show how stupid it sounds what you said. Someone not liking titanforging doesn't mean the design isn't at fault. <br />
Achieving or getting closer to a goal generates a pleasant feeling. Not being able to reach a goal (getting max gear hear) only leads to frustration or endless grinding. It's bad design, not a flaw in someone's mentality.</div></div><hr />

No, he's not an idiot. You just don't like what he says. Also he's not coming out with all those ideas by himself. It's a collaborative process, Ion as a boss has to defend the decisions that were made. Also he wasn't in charge when warforging and titanforging was introduced.<br />
<br />
I myself believe they should just keep warforging and get rid of titanforging. It also should be fixed at +5 ilvl, nice small boost without making an item overpowered.<br />
<br />
As for Azerite Reforging I hate the idea of swapping pieces of gear, talents, traites based on encounter or situation. In my mind it takes away from the identity of a character. Due to the nature of mmo there has to be a way to change this kind of things in case you make a mistake.

The vast majority of the playerbase does not like what he says. Im not alone in this. You are right, he is the boss. That also means he has the ability to tweak and modify systems in place. Doubling down on TF is absolutely is fucking stupid and even you agree it has gone too far. Your plan is exactly what it used to be but has ion changed it? No ion hasnt done shit except continously prove how disconnected he is.<br />

You didn't do normal/heroic in WoD and have it TF to Mythic levels thereby negating the enjoyment of getting that item in Mythic. I don't WANT to get something that makes it so I never have to replace that til the next tier, I play this game for the gear treadmill, I love replacing things. Getting a 385 in Normal just hurts my soul (even just one piece). Ever since they added TF I've had to switch characters constantly because I run out of things that need upgrades (and I'm not talking BiS, I don't chase that shit, I'm just talking meaningful upgrades). Major part of all this isn't even TF though, it's that gear is just too abundant, you walk into a raid almost outgearing it (I don't do the top top end anymore, but am more the capable of doing high M+ when I feel like it, which is seldom this expansion)<br />

Lol this such complete crap. It ruins your sense of progression because you got a piece of gear to titanforge to mythic level in non mythic content? This community is so dramatic it's borderline insanity. How many gear slots do you have?

What is your strategy for introducing new characters and threats to this universe?<br />
<br />
While many of the iconic villains in WoW over the years were first established in the RTS games (Illidan, Arthas, etc.), WoW has been introducing new characters and threats since its earliest days (such as Onyxia or the Defias). We’re keenly aware of the need to begin building up future threats even as we confront existing ones. A major villain shouldn’t come out of nowhere and be a surprise. We plan our expansions out far in advance, so that we can begin foreshadowing and weaving narrative threads to connect them. Garrosh Hellscream is an example of a character born within WoW and built up to eventually become a major villain and then a catalyst that led directly to Azeroth’s confrontation with the Burning Legion. If you look carefully, there are seeds that have been planted and clues that point to who central foes might be in the future.<br />
Illidan says hi.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And not liking titanforging means the design is at fault? K<br />
<br />
It is simply a matter of player mentality. You don't like the design because your mentality is fixed and cannot sustain a design that's meant as a bonus. You want to treat it as a standard, you feel frustrated because you don't get the obvious BONUS. Also, a reminder: getting max gear is your goal? Then why do you hate this system?

<br />
This is literally what they have done for a lot of their raid tiers. Only the end raid final boss usually has something we know/recognise or has any build up. The mid-tier bosses and such are made up as they go along. I mean, G'Huun? The Thunder King? Imperator Whatsisface? Admittedly we get some build up for them, but usually it is just one zone, or some lore thrown in at he start of an expansion and out of the blue.<br />
<br />
Sure, if you want to get finicky, we also have pretty much every minor boss as well made up, but Blizz claiming they invest time and effort in their villains to the extent they are claiming just isn't always true. The ones that have had the most love, have been the ones that have been around since the beginning. The newer ones have been pretty &quot;Meh&quot; with all honesty in comparison.</div></div><hr />

TF is only part of the problem (and it was definitely worse in legion) the main problem is gear is too abundant. I don't Mythic raid anymore, I have no desire to, but Heroic raiding is also out cause M+ just smashes it gear wise, specially in 8.1.

It ruins all sense of gear progression, no one argued with WF back in MoP/WoD, but TF is just down right retarded. If it just stopped at the level of the next difficulty (Lfr only to 355, Normal to 370) they'd kill most of the complaints.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I propose the following: <br />
<br />
There 4 Raid Difficulties. Each raid difficulty rewards gear that is 15 item levels above what the previous tier rewarded (except for LFR, which forms the base power level for raiding gear). <br />
<br />
Raid Finder: 340<br />
Normal: 355<br />
Heroic: 370<br />
Mythic: 385<br />
<br />
When you are rewarded with an item, the game rolls three dice. Each die can reward nothing (most common result), a minor attribute, a gem slot or +5 item levels. This means if you are lucky, all three dice will come up with +5 item levels, which means your gear will then be the equivalent of gear rewarded from the next difficulty up from where you are (so LFR gear is 340, if you roll three +5's, it becomes a 355 piece of gear, or the equivalent of Normal difficulty gear (Normal would go to Heroic and Heroic to Mythic). <br />
<br />
For Mythic difficulty, the +5 item level option will be removed from the die results, that way no matter what happens Mythic item level gear is always the best gear you can get in the game. The gear will still get its three rolls, so it can still be enhanced with minor attributes and/or gem slots. This means that there will always be gear upgrades for you but their impact is less than the system we have currently with +15 item levels on top of mythic gear (which is a system that really frustrates a lot of players).</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nerovar</div><div class="date">2018-11-16, 10:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What really grinds my gears about titanforging is how every time they are asked about it, they trot out that old bullshit straw man of the &quot;LFR raider who got one piece of mythic gear&quot; as if that's the main problem that players have with the system. The real problem most players (including myself) have with titanforging is that: <br />
<br />
(1) it's the RNG gear treadmill taken to the unhealthy far extreme <br />
(2) it makes knowing the best gear for your character nearly impossible without constant simming <br />
(3) leaves players feeling bad about &quot;upgrades&quot; when they really aren't upgrades at all<br />
(4) destroys the goals -&gt; progression -&gt; accomplishment core loop of an RPG<br />
<br />
But of course Ion never talks about these, because he doesn't want to expose the obvious flaws in the system. Instead he pretends it's all about irrational jealousy, so that he can lawyer it away. <br />
<br />
There's NOTHING wrong with a character feeling as if they've reached a pinnacle of gearing for the current tier. In fact, this is A GOOD THING because it provides a realistic goal and a sense of accomplishment. If they really wanted to &quot;preserve a sense of possibility to most encounters&quot; then they could just leave it at 5-10 ilvl warforge with a chance at tertiary stats and/or a socket, but the truth is that they WANT players to be stuck on the treadmill for the entire expansion with no hope of finishing it.<br />
<br />
Fuck titanforging. It's ruined raiding, it's ruined alts, and it's ruined progression.<br />

I agree with your post. With systems like this in place, it's impossible for me to play the game without getting frustrated.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The fact that you think they don't get it is silly. They know what you are talking about. <br />
<br />
The problem is that they have different goals and desires than you do. If this titanforging issue were truly causing people to quit en mass, then it would be changed almost instantly. Since it has stuck around for so long, it is clearly a beneficial to the health of the game (or at least the metrics by which Blizzard measures success). Titanforging benefits two types of players - a) those who are stuck on content and desire to overcome it not by being better but by over-gearing it (whether they consciously realize it or not) and b) those who constantly want the best gear possible and will do anything to get it. The amount of people Titanforging pushes away is clearly smaller than the amount of people who benefit from or desire titanforging. <br />
<br />
There are strong arguments to be made as to why Titanforging is affecting the long term health of the game but to say they do not get your concerns is not accurate. They understand them, they just feel Titanforging is a bigger boon than it is a hinderance. <br />
<br />
However, you can definitely see Blizzard slowly twisting back in your direction with how they removed Legendaries drops from the game (the ultimate form of titanforging). Perhaps next expansion will see Blizzard reign TFing in even more, who is to say.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, I think you've hit on one of my main issues with Legion and BFA. Previously there was always a point with my main where I felt like I was &quot;done&quot; for the tier and could work on alts, or pet battles, or whatever else. Just relaxing stuff. With random loot, titanforging, emissary caches etc., that no longer exists. There is always something else that can be done. I think it is a major contributor to why I felt so burned out with Legion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
-We're not getting rid of titanforging because we don't give a shit that people don't like it and we're too lazy to come up with a better system.<br />
-We're going to continue to arbitrarily punish people with a lot of alts by not introducing proper rep mechanics for multiple characters (for all reps not just one)<br />
-Even though everyone hates it and has told us repeatedly it's a bad idea, we're going to keep going with making azerite gear prohibitively expensive to respec because making you carry 6 helmets and 12 shoulders in your bags is good design or something<br />
-And to address gear in mythic raiding vs. m+, we're just going to say a bunch of nothing and hope people are satisified that we aren't going to do anything.<br />
<br />
Basically they hear you, but also don't give a shit and aren't going to change anything.</div></div><hr />

This is the first time in *years* I've had no desire to even log on and play the game because there is nothing meaningful to do. This expansion is like a desert of boredom. Most of you hate wod and I get it, but at least there was *something* to do, with bfa in its current state there is nothing. This expansion is so far from finished it's just plain ridiculous. It needed at least another 6 months, maybe even a year. I wouldn't be surprised if by next year the expansion will actually feel &quot;fleshed&quot; out. <br />
<br />
The game NEEDS more than some stupid item level grinding. That's literally the downfall of this entire expansion. They think that's all we are, cattle chasing a carrot on a stick. Throw some item levels to make the babies stop crying. Give me a break, this game and the *community* has been turning into a cesspool the last few years.</div></div><hr />

They want you to be able to get gear even after your done mythic raiding which is fine. They want you to be able to get gear from grinding m+ which is fine. All of that is actually good if you wanna play the game for longer than just “raid logging”. <br />
<br />
However, the problem isn’t what he stated. The problem is having items titanforging so damn high that you go into the next difficulty and that awesome mythic item drops but you don’t need it because you already got the same item that titanforged from heroic. <br />
<br />
Titanforging imo can be good for the game. It allows people to play a lot more if they want (like grinding m+) while having a chance to get good shit whereas before we didn’t have that. However right now it has more negatives than positives especially when the above happens. <br />
<br />
They really just need to cap it at something. Getting a lowish titanforge from heroic is already equivalent to mythic. It really is disappointing when you go into mythic and get a fat 385 trinket but it’s not so big because you already got a 385 trinket from heroic. It actually sucks.</div></div><hr />

People can get way to much gear by playing solo with literally 0 challenges, and when they try to apply that ilvl they got, in somewhere where it matters, like raiding or M+, close to their ilvl, they get smacked really hard and think game is shit. But the problem was their gear vs skill curve. If they did not get 360+ by literally login in and stayed at 335 they would start with the lower forms of the proper content and do like M0-M5, Normal Uldir. By the time they got 360 they would know most of the mechanic and can progress further. But this is not the case anymore, and we got 365+ people who never past LFR.</div></div><hr />

About up until MoP ended, if you seriously wanted an answer to that. You know there's a gray scale between &quot;Heroic dungeons are pretty easy&quot; and &quot;You cannot fail even if the healer goes afk&quot;.<br />
At least until WoD released you actually had to play somewhat well to do well, now it's a coma-inducing, godmode snorefest that you can't fail even if you wanted.<br />

Okay, you've quit. But imagine the thousands who play this game as if it were a slot machine (gambling problem much?) that keep playing because of the RNG just for a fraction of a tiny chance to get an upgrade, then complain that Blizzard does this to 'artificially extend sub time'. Guess what, the problem is these people's mentality who treat this game as their gambling fix, and not the game's design. <br />
<br />
Regarding getting huge upgrades: you treat WF or TF as the standard instead of what it is... A BONUS. Then your friend gets this BONUS and you get mad because you didn't get the same BONUS. If anything, you should be mad at the laws of chance, instead of the game or your friend. What you feel there is not hate against the design, it is JEALOUSY. &quot;He got an upgrade and I didn't! TERRIBLE SYSTEM!&quot; Calm down and carry on.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry, but that makes literally no sense. How does it have anything to do with gambling? You're not gambling anything.<br />
<br />
The problem isn't just for me buddy, Bli$$ard/Activi$ion stocks are bleeding, Q3 sub numbers for Wow were way lower than expected, people are not liking this game. Why is it so hard to understand, that maybe, just maybe people would like to see the end game. Like actual true end game. Back before WF/TF we had certain gear we knew we wanted, you'd set out to get it and it was great. At some point you could say, Hey. I'm actually in bis gear now. Lets go world pvp or show off in Ironforge. <br />
<br />
That isn't possible any more. You'll never end up maxed out with the current system. There's literally no way it's possible, although I should say improbable. Any way, my main point against WF/TF is that first of all, my raider friend there didn't do any better than me, he was lower on dps and higher on damage taken, is that fair? No. Is it jealousy? Not really, I'm happy he got it so he could put out better numbers, but my main issue is still the design. I'm not alone here, people do not like WF/TF. Unless you're a LFR hero, it's just not fun. You can call it a bonus and try to justify it, but it'll never make sense. Like I mentioned, it's the reason why raider.io exists, how often do you see people complain about that? So instead of dismissing what I'm saying as selfish jealousy, maybe take a look at the reason why this game is going down the toilet. <br />

Yeah good old days, when game play came before gear. <br />

End game now it seems according to Ion is just getting higher ilvl gear. The journey is gone. I honestly don't know if I'll resub, I'm very worried about Wow right now.</div></div><hr />

I agree with a lot of the sentiment. But who gives a shit about item level? If you're a semi-serious mythic raider or seriously pushing keystones gear is a means to an end. It's not the reward. Nobody wipes on a boss 75 times because they desperately want a 15 item level higher helmet to do world quests. With the removal of unique tier sets though tangible &quot;rewards&quot; for spending months clearing a M raid are unclear. That's my issue. Sure, I enjoy the grind so to speak but my character has nothing to show for it. A higher item level when you look up my armory or inspect me? Fuck that.</div></div><hr />

When you treat it as a bonus this mentality simply dies. People scream and rage and shout and yell as if it happened 100% of the time. Truth is Blizzard has said this this strange behaviour has died down thanks to lowering the chance for it to happen. It's just a bonus. /shrug<br />
<br />
didnt lower it very far. ~75% of my gear is either war/titan/socketed. Maybe more than that. care too little to look. 7/8M and ~2 pieces I wear are ACTUALLY from the raid. <br />

Glad pantheon is getting closer by the day.<br />

Sad to see they are still catering to the &quot;silent majority&quot;. Have fun playing a game with subs fallen to 1 mil.<br />
<br />
well, being objective here. Ive been disgusted with the direction wow has been headed for MAAAAANY years. I saw this writing on the wall beginning in BC for gods sake.<br />
<br />
that being said, of course they are LOL. (catering to the majority, silent or otherwise). The game drew in a lot of first time mmorpger's based on IP, and this is what they know, expect, and believe the genre is. Veterans and people that know cannon mmorpgs and their tenets are left to the wayside, cause if we all left tomorrow - they'd still have their &quot;silent majority&quot; and thus their $$$. They are a business after all. <br />
<br />
Still no less their fault, but they DO know their demographic contrary to what we want to believe. We just arent the target audience. <br />
<br />
As for subs falling. I eat that up myself. Jaded? Sure? Saw it happening, sure. Still 1 million subs is a metric ton. Most mmorpgs need just tens of thousands to stay profitable. Wow needs much more than that I imagine, or did. Before all the homegenizing and streamlining with automated systems. Now, who knows. But with ~1m subs they'll still be cranking out the warforged items and new ways to get meaningless gear. No worries.<br />
<br />
Only good news is wow will keep most if its &quot;target audience&quot; captive while I move onto another game. <br />
<br />
Entire genre has been jacked courtesy of blizzard.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">micwini</div><div class="date">2018-11-17, 11:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">And not liking titanforging means the design is at fault? K<br />
<br />
It is simply a matter of player mentality. You don't like the design because your mentality is fixed and cannot sustain a design that's meant as a bonus. You want to treat it as a standard, you feel frustrated because you don't get the obvious BONUS. Also, a reminder: getting max gear is your goal? Then why do you hate this system? It benefits you, lol.<br />
<br />
That's basic human psychology, which you can bet your ass off blizzard knows about it. It is the same way games like candy crush are designed: Frustration = more money. Titanforging is designed to be a never ending, frustrating goals to make sure the average player, plays the game more, despite being frustrated. It's a design flaw and thats not an opinion, unless you think designing frustrating systems is good design.<br />
<br />
If you think that titanforging being unfun is a mentality problem, then I can say the same about Island expeditions in the same way you approached titanforging:<br />
Island expeditions are not meant to be grinded for AP. Doing more is just a bonus and if you treat the extra grinding as the standard, then it's your mentality at fault.<br />
See what I did there?<br />
<br />
You have to understand that game design should always take into account human psychology.</div></div><hr />

You just don't like what he says. Also he's not coming out with all those ideas by himself. It's a collaborative process, Ion as a boss has to defend the decisions that were made. Also he wasn't in charge when warforging and titanforging was introduced.<br />
<br />
I myself believe they should just keep warforging and get rid of titanforging. It also should be fixed at +5 ilvl, nice small boost without making an item overpowered.<br />
<br />
As for Azerite Reforging I hate the idea of swapping pieces of gear, talents, traites based on encounter or situation. In my mind it takes away from the identity of a character. Due to the nature of mmo there has to be a way to change this kind of things in case you make a mistake. Increasing cost of reforging azerite traits gives you this option in case of a mistake and makes the choice you make more meaningful.<br />
<br />
so does being able to change specs on a whim. Wow hasnt cared about community or character identity in alotta years my friend. its the rpg version of a moba now.<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
Lol this such complete crap. It ruins your sense of progression because you got a piece of gear to titanforge to mythic level in non mythic content? This community is so dramatic it's borderline insanity. How many gear slots do you have? If your running mythic content regularly (raid) how many titanforged pieces from low level content are as good as the mythic pieces you've obtained? One slot? Two if your extremely lucky? That ruins the game for you?<br />
<br />
as stated previously, i use MAYBE 2 pieces from mythic. MAYBE. (not gonna bother switching between specs to check)<br />
<br />
everything is 390/395 from chest or m+ <br />
<br />
ilvl 386 fwiw. good news is, i only log in tues/thurs for raid - and saturday to run keys. <br />
<br />
About the only thing i can appreciate regarding BFA is a metric ton of freetime back.<br />

Some people are overachievers, tryhards, and can't stay quiet for 5 minutes. These are the people who complain about warforge and titanforge.<br />
<br />
or people that view wow like well... ANYTHING IN OUR MEEK EXISTENCE where time and effort invested is ~= to output.<br />
<br />
except, wow defies the laws of the universe. I play better and more often than a particular guild member im thinking of, by roughly thrice. Yet he has a higher ilvl by several ilvls, better trinkets, and better weapon.<br />
<br />
seems legit. <br />
<br />
sorry, im not a &quot;neckbeard&quot; I have a life. I have kids, i try to strike a balance. When im playing wow, im making a sacrifice. Whether it be from time with friends, family, playing other games, you name it.<br />

I cant make said sacrifices in good conscience while the other guy who just logs in for his one +10 a week has more to show for it.<br />

Previously there was always a point with my main where I felt like I was &quot;done&quot; for the tier and could work on alts, or pet battles, or whatever else. Just relaxing stuff. With random loot, titanforging, emissary caches etc., that no longer exists. There is always something else that can be done. I think it is a major contributor to why I felt so burned out with Legion.<br />
<br />
thats the idea now. They &quot;no longer report sub numbers&quot; because theyre abysmal. They had to turn to a new &quot;metric&quot; for success. They now report concurrent subs or some such. These annoying systems keep people playing longer and they contort that into success.<br />
<br />
Really its like prescribing an addict his opiate more or less. Take myself for example. I hate the game now. Loathe it. Began to in legion when it made such a dramatic swing in this direction (and a plethora of other reasons). Thats the first xpac I have quit since vanilla. BFA about to be the 2nd.<br />
<br />
Why did i come back at all? and why am i currently playing? 2 reasons. 1) longtime friends/guildies and 2) time spent/invested.<br />

It's funny, because during Cata people complainted that heroics were too difficult. So Blizzard nerfed em. Now when cata timewalking happens, people die left and right to nerfed mechanics of outdated dungeons because they never learned to play. <br />
<br />
To change gears here a bit: I think the biggest point that Blizzard is missing is that they want to keep people chasing gear rewards. Which is fine! That's kind of what the game is about. But along the way somewhere, they forgot to make chasing that gear FUN! It's weird, because you look at something like the Mage Tower, or Green Fire, that people were willing to chase purely for a cosmetic reward. <br />
<br />
It doesn't ALWAYS have to be chasing a random drop change TF upgrade. Just make the content a little challenging, then put decent, fair rewards that people can pursue with deterministic progress, NOT just random % chance to WF/TF.</div></div><hr />

Of course, we understand that when an exceptionally lucky player gets a perfect Titanforged item from a Raid Finder boss, that can feel like it undermines Mythic content, but ultimately, that’s just a single piece of gear. Overall, the Mythic raider will be better-geared than the Normal or Heroic raider, even if the latter gets lucky once.<br />
<br />
<br />
I hate that the titanforging issue keeps getting directed to the idea of LFR players becoming full 395 geared along with mythic raiders. The issue is that the gear inflation caused by titanforging creates an unnatural progression where players can get into content they aren't suited for and ruining the runs. I'm not worried about an LFR player outgearing a mythic raider, but I am concerned by the number of m+ runs I get into with a 360+ player doing 3-5K dps and standing in everything.</div></div><hr />

Over the course of the last 14 years, we've killed many Warcraft villains. What is your strategy for introducing new characters and threats to this universe?<br />
<br />
While many of the iconic villains in WoW over the years were first established in the RTS games (Illidan, Arthas, etc.), WoW has been introducing new characters and threats since its earliest days (such as Onyxia or the Defias). We’re keenly aware of the need to begin building up future threats even as we confront existing ones. A major villain shouldn’t come out of nowhere and be a surprise. We plan our expansions out far in advance, so that we can begin foreshadowing and weaving narrative threads to connect them. Garrosh Hellscream is an example of a character born within WoW and built up to eventually become a major villain and then a catalyst that led directly to Azeroth’s confrontation with the Burning Legion. If you look carefully, there are seeds that have been planted and clues that point to who central foes might be in the future.<br />

<br />
Yeah,and most of our gear comes from m+,because it is overwhelmingly more profitable when it comes to gear,even for a lot of our raiders in my guild who do one m+ a week have most of their gear from m+<br />

m+ offer easier to get,farmable gear that can exist with every combination of stats due to the amount of versions of each slots exist.It is better gear,and has no weekly lockout,on top of dropping in much higher quantities (average 20% drop from raids (1 item for 5 players) versus 40 to 60% in mythic plus (2 to 3 items per 5 players,EXCLUDING extra loot from completing higher key levels in time)</div></div><hr />

&quot;Part of making an alt can be having a fresh set of goals and rewards to pursue once you’re starting to run out of accessible goals on your main&quot; in regard to rep. <br />
<br />
Doing rep on an alt is not fresh and new.. LOL</div></div><hr />

Let us earn a currency that we can then use to buy Titanforging upgrades for a piece of gear, the same way you did back in Mists of Pandaria. It doesn't feel good to run your face into the wall repeatedly hoping that RNG will grant you what you want, it DOES feel good being able to earn that upgrade over days or weeks of work.<br />
<br />
This, hundred times over! Way better solution which would fix the problem of lacking some gear to kill a boss without having to relay on rng, which was never good, and it would give me an actual reason to do raids again. Also, should remove sockets being random as well, this is as bad as wf/tf in my opinion. Let players be again on the same playfield.<br />

Did you kick your feet and throw yourself on the ground when the warrior got that drop, too?<br />
<br />
Wrong. When I was not raiding the highest diff I was never jealous of other player's gear, because I knew he has earned it by doing the hardest content in game. Which made me wanting to do the same, so I could have the same gear as he does.<br />
<br />
Being blessed by rng doesn't feel good in an mmorpg game, it doesn't feel like I have earned it, it could have never happened, it means I was just more lucky than the other guy doing the same thing I do. You might get that Pog feel for like 2 sec, but other than that it feels bad long term. Missing the time when gear progression mattered.<br />

<br />
Lol this such complete crap. It ruins your sense of progression because you got a piece of gear to titanforge to mythic level in non mythic content? This community is so dramatic it's borderline insanity. How many gear slots do you have? If your running mythic content regularly (raid) how many titanforged pieces from low level content are as good as the mythic pieces you've obtained? One slot? Two if your extremely lucky? That ruins the game for you?<br />
<br />
I went from the best geared player on my server at the end of cata to not even being able to get a full bis gear at the end of mop, and I have killed Garrosh/cleared raid for at least 40 times on the hardest difficulty. At least in cata I knew for what I was working for, now I don't, which kills my sense of progression and fun in the same way.</div></div><hr />

I am not sure how you mean, you just go on all your characters and any new ones it adds to the tally. If it's a reputation on a character you deleted or so, yeah that one will not be count.

<br />
We feel that it’s important for characters to retain a certain element of distinct progression. Part of making an alt can be having a fresh set of goals and rewards to pursue once you’re starting to run out of accessible goals on your main, so we don’t make reputation globally account-wide. But some players feel compelled to re-earn reputations in a way that’s frustrating and we want to do what we can to help alleviate their specific concerns. We’re addressing some of that in Tides of Vengeance:<br />
<br />
<br />
-- So...what I want to know is...who the hell makes an alt with having to level reputations again as a goal?<br />
Answer: Nobody.<br />
<br />
Just another b/s excuse to not make reputation account-wide. Nobody wants to have to continuously re-level reputation on every single alt they make.</div></div><hr />

Hmm..you DO know that Retail and classic are the same game right? Personally, i can't really get into a game area that I played 13 years ago. But that's just me.<br />
<br />

Yeah I'm done with this shitshow of a game now. Bring on Classic.<br />
<br />
Why not just play on a classic server then? :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also, when I make a new alt, I am not doing it to grind reputations... I make it to have a different playstyle/combat/role than my main... dont pretend you care about my goals, you only care about my sub which you think you will extend with no account-wide reps... (you actually ended my sub dude, thank god classic is releasing... although I am still nervous about your ability to ruin it)<br />
<br />
So, let me try to understand, you said that they are undermining your capacity to bring your alt to a level where you can switch between your alt and your main with your friends, being raiding, m+ or whatever. And no account-wide reps are also a reason.<br />
<br />
Then you said &quot;thanks god classic is releasing&quot;, ok, I did not play classic but help me here, as far as I've heard whatever you are complaining about alts CAN'T be better in classic. You still don't have account-wide reps, the progress of your character is way slower and by no means alt friendly.<br />
<br />
I don't dislike WF/TF, but I agree it scales a lot, it should be at best 10+ ilvl and that being rare. You can gear up pretty fast and that actually helps your alts a lot...<br />
<br />
What I mean is, your post makes no sense. If you want to go to classic because BFA is not &quot;alt-friendly&quot; I don't understand. If you want to go to classic because you want a more hardcore and rewarding experience for investing a lot of time then you are surely doing the right thing.</div></div><hr />

Retail has transmog, classic not. The reason people ask for account wide reps are for transmogs reason and some extra utilities (Like the boat vehicle from MoP anglers where you can fish from the boat). In classic you dont have to care about such things. In Retail, 1 character cannot unlock transmogs for all others, so its kind of trolling that they said &quot;we hear you&quot; and that they will make transmog you get with 1 character &quot;account wide&quot;.<br />
<br />
Second, yes alts are better in classic, because there is no time gating on what you try to achieve. In retail, I can only do 7-8 WQs per day and hope for the emossary if I want to get rep with a faction. In Classic, I just grind mobs and items. <br />
<br />
In retail for example, think you have a warrior and a mage. You log in with your warrior Monday to Satarday and play 1 hour each day (total 6 hours). Then on Sunday you log with your mage alt and play 8 hours straight because is your free day. Warrior will be by far more advanced and progressed than your mage even if your mage has 2 more hours gameplay. Not only in reputations, but in Artifact power, gold and gear too.<br />
<br />
In Classic, your mage will be more advanced than your warrior, because he played 2 more hours, period. That for me is alt friendly. It is also Freedom to do whatever I want with my time, rather than get tunneled into specific tasks.</div></div><hr />

A new player entering Azeroth gets access to fourteen years of content, with entire worlds to explore and stories to unravel. But that same content can also be a daunting. Including a character boost with our recent expansions is one way of making sure that players can always leap directly into the latest and greatest content, but that’s far from a complete solution.<br />
<br />
We’re taking a fresh look at our new player experience, with the goal of making it better reflect the quality and scope of the modern game. That’s a long-term project, but it’s an essential one as many brand-new players try out WoW for the first time every way, and we want to make sure we’re welcoming them into Azeroth and really showing off everything that is awesome about World of Warcraft.<br />
<br />
I have to admit that I find it quite impressive in how talented Blizzard is at avoiding answering questions.<br />
<br />
Essentially, Blizzard is saying that they really want to make it so that they can keep the overwhelming amount of content for current players to slog through to keep them playing excessively on new alts without pushing away potential new players because of how tedious and long the leveling experience is.<br />
<br />
Strangely enough, they can't find a viable solution... go figure! :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />
