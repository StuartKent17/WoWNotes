<br />
Rake should again be able to trigger Primal Fury.<br />
<br />
<br />
Dungeons &amp; Raids<br />
Firelands<br />
<br />
Characters who make for a good Dinner Time should no longer be ported to Ancient Core Hounds they are not in combat with when the ability’s effects end.<br />
Fire Scorpion and Flamewaker corpses no longer provide loot or reputation when they’re eaten by Hell Hounds and Fire Turtles.<br />
Unstable Magmas are now gaining energy properly from the Flamewaker Animators.<br />
Alysrazor<br />
<br />
Voracious Hatchlings will now Imprint on a new target if their current target dies.<br />

<br />
Flame Scythe now properly hits pets.<br />
Fandral can now cast Searing Seeds and Burning Orbs while moving.<br />
<br />
Ragnaros<br />
<br />
Several locations which could be used to avoid damage from Engulfing Flames have been adjusted so they’re no longer safe spots.<br />
Combustible will always be reapplied to Living Meteors, even if the attacking character dies as a Meteor Impact occurs.<br />
Living Meteors will now become frozen by Cenarius under all conditions when transitioning into phase 4 on Heroic difficulty.<br />
If a Living Meteor is frozen in the lava pool during the transition into phase 4 on Heroic difficulty, it will teleport on a player after the stun ends, but will no longer explode immediately. Players now have a 2-second window to escape the meteor’s melee range.<br />
Living Meteors will gain the Living Meteor Transform buff once frozen in the Breadth of Frost trap, even if a meteor is knocked into it.<br />
If a Living Meteor's fixated target drops aggro via Feign Death, the meteor will target the pet, and then select a new non-pet target upon which to fixate.<br />
Ragnaros now enrages after 18 minutes in all raid difficulties and sizes, up from 15 minutes.<br />

Wounded Hyjal Defenders should no longer sometimes spawn in with full health and in a standing position when players are on the quest Burn Victims.<br />
Molten Lords no longer become tapped by the first player who attacks them with any of the Trained Fire Hawk's abilities while on the quest Fire in the Skies, allowing for any player who dealt damage to the Molten Lord to gain quest credit upon its death.<br />
Windcallers now respawn within 1 minute on average for the quest Into the Fire when both are rendered inactive. Additionally, players will only experience a maximum of approximately 75 seconds of a delay before they are able to initiate the escort event.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Arena Season Transition Compensation<br />
We're still on track for 7/19 and will have some additional info posted soon on who should expect to receive the 4000 compensation points. <br />

Proof? Look, he still melees his main aggro target, be it a prot warrior or a turtle. Do you know how hard a turtle gets hit? Cleave damage aside, that turtle is going to get one shot unless you chain cooldowns, and I mean like 6 Disc Priest worth of cooldowns.<br />
<br />
Until somebody shows video proof of a turtle tanking Fandral for more than like ~20 seconds I'm not believing it; even though I doubt many guilds did this.</div></div><hr />

Isn't that exactly what an exploit is? Abusing a flaw in the game?<br />

I wonder does this make the fight easier now, if you take hunters, locks &amp; UH DKs and force the pet to stand in front of the boss.</div></div><hr />

I wonder does this make the fight easier now, if you take hunters, locks &amp; UH DKs and force the pet to stand in front of the boss.No, an exploit is abusing a game bug. I think It was Ensidia that used 25 soul stones in TotC. Not exploiting ANYTHING, but just something that was overlooked by developers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
for guilds with low dps that are carried by their healers? there was a thread last night active with people discussing the nerfs, and some member of paragon showed up, telling people they didn't even know about the enrage timer, since they had yet to wipe to it<br />
<br />
<br />
tha majority of them, probably, yes<br />
<br />
till you provide proof (which i'm sure you will not find), this is just you talking out off your ass :3</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aleom</div><div class="date">2011-07-13, 08:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Proof?

You don't need all those cooldowns. A properly specced turtle can tank it just fine. Considering Blood of the Rhino increases all Healing done to the pet by 40% and you have every healer in the raid spamming it, and also Avoidance (a passive ability to all hunter/warlock pest) reduces Area of Effect damage by 90%, and Domo's scorpion cleave counts as AoE damage. <br />
So the fight goes like this <br />
--Warrior pulls boss<br />
--Turtle taunts off warrior<br />
--Entire raid stands BEHIND scorpion<br />
--Entire raid gains 100% damage buff <br />
--Every healer spams Turtle Tank<br />
--Domo turned into Patchwerk style DPS/healing race because he never leaves Scorpion form <br />
--Boss Dies <br />
--????<br />
--Profit!</div></div><hr />

Boss is immune to the pet's taunt, and always has been. I'm also not sure how the pet will keep up threat the entire time, he can't be a target of a rogue's misdirection, and the DPS/Healers will still generate threat (albeit at a slightly reduced rate, that's part of the concentration buff.) Have you done this fight, and have you done the fight on heroic? Have you seen a specced turtle tank it just fine? Or are you making assumptions? <br />
<br />
Regardless, it's a moot point now. The cleave hits the pet now, and even with the 90% reduction it's too much damage to heal through. That said, I still don't think it was possible for more than a few cooldown's worth of damage protection. Unless somebody releases a video we'll simply never know.</div></div><hr />
