<br />
But seriously, looks like Diablo may be flagship for this Blizzcon. In this case lack of Diablo 4 would be a huge disappointment.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Probably more tickets available, considering most people never even make it to the queue before tickets sell out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The first two sold out quickly. So they may have decided to add more tickets, perhaps by adding more space to the Con.</div></div><hr />

I'm excited. <br />

Are you excited? <br />

I'm excited.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A complete mog-set would be nice for wow and another special card with crazy stuff like ETC for hearthstone.<br />
<br />
What would you like?</div></div><hr />

Not everyone can come to USA to participate in Blizzcon.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EyelessCrow</div><div class="date">2018-08-08, 08:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I might attempt to buy tickets to next year's blizzcon. I'm making cosplay armor for the mountain of game of thrones for Halloween this year, coming out pretty good so far (the armor he uses to fight Oberyn in). I might make something wow related next year so I can wear it. Thinking about a paladin and 3d printing crystals to put lights into to make a dull glow and maybe even use wire lighting to accent the armor edges...so many nerdy possibilities!</div></div><hr />

<br />
This will be the fifth year in a row that my partner and I attend BlizzCon. Unfortunately, this year I had to resort to buying tickets from scalpers at well over face value because we couldn't get tickets in either round 1 or round 2.<br />
<br />
Really poor planning on Blizzards part. Scalpers win, yet again.</div></div><hr />

Ya i ended up getting 4 tickets for me and my friends but we had a 5th. We were not able to get 1 more ticket during the 2nd round. So we ended up paying a ticket scalper way too much. This happens way too often..</div></div><hr />
