<meta name="description" content="Keyboard issues with Avast 4.8 
If you're using Avast 4.8 as an antivirus (and a lot of players probably do), the latest update might cause keyboard problems while playing World of Warcraft. Most of the time you will experience a &quot;keyboard lag&quot;, after pushing a key the game will only react 2 or 3 seconds later.  
There was some mention on the French forums about Avast 4.8, there was an update released this week that for some seems to be causing problems.

WoWHead updated with new features<br />
During the last week, Wowhead has been updated with a bunch of new features.<br />
<br />
The Wowhead model viewer (http://www.wowhead.com/?help=modelviewer) has now been updated! You can now view 3d models for armor pieces (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=940), item sets (http://www.wowhead.com/?itemset=217) and humanoid NPCs (http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=4949)! You can even change the race and gender you want them displayed on, and the model viewer will remember what you selected.<br />
<br />
In addition to the added support for character models, the following improvements have been made to the model viewer:<br />
<br />
Both Versions<br />
Added model bones to support placement of weapons/armor.<br />
Moved from COLLADA format to a custom binary model format for faster loading times.<br />
NPC models set to an animated, cooler-looking pose.<br />
Added anti-aliasing.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Flash<br />
Motion blur effect when spinning models<br />
Texture softening<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Java<br />
Viewport sized to fit<br />
Sprite tinting<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Any bugs related to the model viewer should be reported here.<br />
<br />
Next up, Wowhead now supports quest tooltips (http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=9123)! All sites that are Powered by Wowhead (http://www.wowhead.com/?powered) will automatically have this same feature added.<br />
<br />
Also, Wowhead is very excited to announce the addition of a brand new feature--NPC Ability Listings (http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=24976#abilities). The Wowhead Client (http://www.wowhead.com/?client) now automatically gathers data on the abilities that NPCs use, and automatically uploads it to Wowhead. Finally a use for all of those Uncategorized Spells!<br />
