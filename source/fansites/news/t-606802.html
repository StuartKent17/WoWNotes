Items upgrade in WotLK<br />
Players and items will have an increase in their stats/items that goes along with leveling to 80, it will just be a little more consistent when compared to The Burning Crusade. What I mean by this is the way items are working right now will be closer to the new items you get in Wrath of the Lich King and it isn't like you will see an item with double the usual amount of stamina from your first quest.

Infinite Dragonflight in Caverns of Time: Culling of Stratholme (WoWWiki (http://www.wowwiki.com/Culling_of_Stratholme))<br />
And outside of knowing the new Caverns of Time: Stratholme instance is based on the Warcraft III level 'The Culling', not a lot of details have been shared. More will come in due time, whether the Infinite Dragonflight will show up remains to be seen.

Griefing on PvP Realms<br />
There's a PvP resolution to being camped, get some friends, use the chat channels to ask for help, or find a higher level character nearby to beg for assistance. It really isn't the job of support or design to hold your hand all the time though, which happens quite a lot I think you'll agree, but you've created a character on a realm that is based around being able to kill other players. It isn't always going to be fair, and in fact the rules of war are based around attacking when the odds are in your favor. Now how that applies to an online game is obviously not quite as clear, but the fact remains that while it may not be honorable to attack a weaker target, it's certainly easier.

EU approves Vivendi and Activision deal<br />
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - French telecom and media group Vivendi won permission from the European Commission on Wednesday to merge its videogame unit with Activision Inc in a $9.85 billion deal.<br />
<br />
The complex deal will give Vivendi a 52 percent stake in a new industry giant called Activision Blizzard with annual revenue of $3.8 billion, rivaling that of Electronic Arts Inc, the world's biggest independent game publisher.<br />
<br />
The Commission said for &quot;all categories of game software, the combined firm would continue to face several strong, effective competitors, such as Electronic Arts, and the game console manufacturers, such as Sony, Nintendo and Microsoft.&quot;<br />
<br />
Activision is riding high on the success of games such as &quot;Guitar Hero,&quot; &quot;Call of Duty&quot; and &quot;Tony Hawk&quot; but has lacked an offering in the online role-playing area, dominated by &quot;World of Warcraft&quot; from Vivendi's Blizzard Entertainment.<br />
