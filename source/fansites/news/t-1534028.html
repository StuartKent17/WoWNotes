Huh. I thought from the wording this would have been a RAF pet.<br />

It was a joke. Excuse me for not being serious. <br />
<br />
As I did with the skyreaver, I won't be buying this right away. Seeing 100s of others around kills the coolness of it. I'll wait a couple months til everyone else gets sick of it.<br />

Edit: Ha, and it's 30$. Probably wont buy that until next year.</div></div><hr />

And the post isnt so you can make your mount look like it, its for your party members to be able to have the mount for 20 min without paying for it.</div></div><hr />

This is unfair to those who only have so much money to spend each month...</div></div><hr />

Not even F2P games don't charge this much, and they need microtransactions to survive. WoW can survive with sub and selling copies alone, all this extra microtransactions is just extra money going straight to their pockets.</div></div><hr />

Both. You get the mount and a hitching post vanity item that allows others to transform their mount into the Warforged Nightmare for 20 mins (3 min CD).</div></div><hr />

I normally buy the mounts out of the hell of it, but this time they just screwed this mount up entirely by that and its HORRID running animation.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Azrile</div><div class="date">2014-06-11, 08:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">And as much as people complain about the $30, you will see millions of these the first day they are released. Sad but true, but Blizzard makes more per mount than most games earn in a year. In fact, the Brewdog pet, where Blizzard gave half the money to charity, Blizzards share of the profits were more than Age of Conan earned in a year.... one pet...<br />
<br />
Don´t expect them to stop selling them until players stop buying them... which probably isn´t going to happen any time soon.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Queen of Hamsters</div><div class="date">2014-06-11, 08:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bought it, and it's a proper mount (as suggests) and once you learn it you get the hitching post in the mail. Pretty cool mount, but doesn't use the normal horse animations. It uses the animations of the Swift Windsteed which is a nice change.<br />
<br />
8 more and I'll land at 250 before WoD as I had hoped...just a ton of TCG mounts to obtain still.</div></div><hr />

I don't lie, I am tempting to buy it, but from the other hand I am thinking that I pay sub so the devs create content for the game and not for the shop...If only they put so much effort and imagination to the in-game mounts...<br />
<br />
But the ingame have some mounts that are so much cooler than anything in the shop.<br />
<br />
I would take Invincible, Ashes of Al'ar, Flametalon of Alysrazor, Black Qiraji Battle Tank, Mimiron's Head, Sky Golem or Red Flying Cloud over any of the shop mounts any day.</div></div><hr />

Simple really, the people who mass buy this crap are facilitating the removal of content from the game. A company will get away with exactly what its customers let it get away with.

I think WoD will be fairly meh, I think Blizzard has lost their mind with some changes, I'm not thrilled about the lack of content. However I do have an active sub at the moment, because I do enjoy running Flex with friends one day a week. If the mount wasn't hideous and if I didn't get charged ludicrous sales tax for digital purchases, I might consider buying it, but IMO it's ugly, $30 is steep, and 10% sales tax on a digital item is moronic, but hey if someone else likes it, cool. <br />

That's the glass half empty way of looking at it. You're assuming that if this mount wasn't in the store there would be more content, or that this mount would be available by other means. It's equally, if not more likely, that if store mounts didn't sell this mount just wouldn't exist. If you don't like it, don't buy it. I don't like it, so I'm not buying it, but I won't begrudge someone else for buying it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ofcourse not but they could just give it for free (maybe a reward for finishing an achievement, which is also content) while people are paying € 13 a month for a year without new content. Seriously, get over yourself, no one cares about what you spend your money on. Just because some people are willing to pay for these cosmetic items doesn't mean everyone should be fine with it. The &quot;argument&quot; that you can just not buy these items or even quit playing completely is just nonsense, obviously. Everyone plays for multiple reasons.</div></div><hr />

I get the point, it's not a very intelligent one though thus I say it's silly since no amount of store mounts would make them postpone the EXPANSION, which will bring in the big dough. You go argue with the dog, maybe it will just agree with you blindly. Fact: With or without store mounts, the expansion would take as long as it will to come out. <br />

You're assuming that if this mount wasn't in the store there would be more content, or that this mount would be available by other means. It's equally, if not more likely, that if store mounts didn't sell this mount just wouldn't exist. If you don't like it, don't buy it. I don't like it, so I'm not buying it, but I won't begrudge someone else for buying it.<br />
<br />
Look, WoW's models are cartoony and basic, which is fine, I love the style, but I have serious problems believing they have to abandon projects as simple and basic as a mount, because they cant fund it. They own WoW / SC / Diablo / HS some of, if not the biggest games on the market right now, as well as the bustling eSports scene that surrounds these games.<br />

Its almost unthinkable for me to assume they cannot release these mounts without the (most likely) hundreds of thousands of dollars they make from just 1.<br />

Ah, so Blizzard say they are too busy to make pretty much anything that players request (moonkin form etc) and give us content and are working on WoD, anything that the players request will apparently come at the expense of something else (raid tier was the words they used), yet WoD alpha is only just out, beta announcement is nowhere to be seen, and they still find time to make all of these store mounts and crap (yet no content for us) which takes time so by Blizzard logic is actually delaying the expansion. <br />
<br />
This clearly isn't an intelligent point though because Blizzard clearly don't want your money and aren't milking you, they just want to help you to get to 250 mounts :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

A mount with like seven animations take a lot less time to make then a tier of content or even a dungeon. Was it a scumbag move for them to put it in the store yeah but they have every right.

Point is they say they don't have time to do anything outside of WoD development, yet clearly they do have time to add this stuff to the shop, they are always contradicting themselves. No, making mounts and such doesn't take as much as a whole raid, but the time probably could've been used to develop a filler raid for MoP. Raids like RS wouldn't have taken long to implement/design at all compared to ICC etc.</div></div><hr />

Lets not pretend the store mounts are a labour of love, they are marketed to be highly appealing (ie more unique than another 50 reskinned cloud serpents). First bat mount is in store / first colour changing mount also in store. Both arent technological feats they are just good marketing.<br />
<br />
I dont doubt they are incentivised to make more mounts because of the cash, but thats a terrible thing to be racing after, in a game where you already pay monthly and initially.</div></div><hr />

Did I time travel to 1st April somehow? ALL MMOs would kill to have the subs this game has, the amount of services they have that most people have at least used once or twice. The amount of games they have made that are success. Oh and lets not forget the billions after billions blizzard has made from WoW subs alone, and more billions to come. Can't you at least stop putting mounts for sale on the stupid store? This is getting ridiculous.<br />
<br />
All the mounts we get ingame are either fugly or Raid/PvP exclusive, and they make sure to reuse each model at least 15-20 times. Look at shitty MMO games with like 10 players, they can make way cooler mounts then Blizzard does, and they don't even charge half as much as Blizzard does.<br />
<br />
If WoW would be f2p I would understand, but seriously? I'm paying you enough, I've payed you enough and I want my mounts as an in-game reward. I want hard earned achievements that reward cool mounts, profession mounts that don't take xx days to complete, but you gotta be willingly to spend A LOT of gold or waste A LOT of time farming.<br />
<br />
IMO only thing that should be on the store should be games and some irl stuff like teddy bears or fancy tshirts. Not stuff we should get rewarded though playing the game. All mounts, pets, cosmetics etc should be rewarded for playing the god damn game. Not work irl to pay you even more. Damn, what happened to Blizzard, they're more greedy than uncle scrooge, literally.</div></div><hr />

Mercedes Benz costs thousands and most people can't afford it. Most people could buy this mount a 100 times if they wanted, it's the principle, not everyone is jealous because they can't afford it...</div></div><hr />

I'm not sure, but I would think me spending 15$ a month, for the last what, 8 years? I've taken a break every now and then so lets say 5 years of active subs since I started. That's around 1000$ only on subs. I've transferred a few times, changed race and whatnot. Spent money on the game it self+expansions. Deluxe of MoP+WoD. And you're telling me, it's fair for them to just sell their mounts on the store? At least offer the mount for free to those who have been playing since freaking forever and helped them be who they are today. Without us the old players, WoW would be nothing. Yet they don't give a SHIT about us. They only and I mean ONLY want us to pay more and more. They're so greedy,they would walk upto a dying person, instead of helping him they would ask him where the 10$ he owes them are. THAT'S how greedy they are.</div></div><hr />

No matter what they'd do, somebody would complain. A &quot;Thank you&quot; for paying for their services? Where to start with that, would you have been a paying customer for X amount of time, would you have been registered with Blizzard for X amount of time - in all scenarios you would not give something to somebody and therefore somebody would complain. If you pay for something on your own free will, you must like it. If you EXPECT more than what you're paying for, that's really your problem and if Blizzard doesn't give in to your demands, again your problem (although it becomes Blizzards problem, should you stop paying them) but in the end one has to vote with their wallets, how else would you get feedback as such a big company from millions and millions of customers of various kinds, in the front the loudest of them all complaining like Blizz started to cut off peoples limbs.<br />
<br />
People are too invested into this whole thing - got a new mount in the shop and you dont like it? Great, no money for Blizzard!

I'm sure it probably didn't take more then one person to make this. So many people act like the whole developement team and all of Blizzard came together to make a mount.<br />
<br />
It's based off the Swift Windsteed skeleton, and has the forsaken mount look just remodeled to look metal.<br />
<br />
If you don't want it, don't buy it, people.<br />
<br />
As for me, I bought it. People waste money on smoking, drinking, eating more food then required, buying real life things they don't need and hardly use. This is no different. It's not needed and if anyone wishes to spend their money they worked for on it, so let them.</div></div><hr />

What does Blizzard do? Release a new mount to the store! better yet, they also hiked the price up to 30$.<br />

I get they want to make money, but don't you want to earn this mount instead? I bought the star pony day one, and have bought 3 other shop mounts, but don't you think its a little disheartening to see yet another mount accessible only to those willing to spend half a game's worth or two months subscription just for a mount?

Maybe you missed the memo, but that's what businesses do, make money for their employees and shareholders. Your, and any other whiner's, misplaced righteous indignation is laughable and idiotic.<br />

&quot;OMG BLIZZ, U SUK! I QUIT WOW NOW!&quot;<br />
&quot;STOP WASTING WOD RESOURCES BLIZZ, EVERY TIME ONE OF YOUR EMPLOYEES BLINKS WE LOOSE A RAID TIER!&quot;<br />
&quot;BWIZZARD IS A GWEEDY CORPOWATE BUSINESS AND N E 1 WHO DISAGWEES IS A BIG DUM FANBOY. NO EXCEPTIONS!&quot;<br />
<br />
I'm disappointed, but im not PMSing over this stuff. It's REALLY not that big a deal, these mounts have no impact on the game and do not take resource away from WoD or any other part of WoW. I could've sworn the Nightmare would be RAF and Reaver would be store bought, but oh well, just a missed opportunity imo lets move on now kids.</div></div><hr />

Was it a scumbag move for them to put it in the store yeah but they have every right. Content takes a lot longer then making one mount bro they aren't equivalent but I do agree its a d bag move.<br />
According to blizzard basically everything they do will take away from a raid tier and use that as a lame ass excuse so as long as blizzard is using that excuse to not make anything we can use that same excuse in the opposite way when they do make something.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This clearly isn't an intelligent point though because Blizzard clearly don't want your money and aren't milking you, they just want to help you to get to 250 mounts :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
What says it's the same team? What says they won't do it eventually? What about druids make them so special that they should get new models? New models affect druid players, not the entire community. And, quite frankly, it doesn't bring them money fast like a store item does. <br />
<br />
And no, Blizzard aren't milking me, since I'm an adult and as such can decide what I want to do with my money. If I want to spend 25 euro (not a lot) on pixels or 150 + 100 on dinner and a movie, that's up to me...the pixels will last longer though. If I didn't want it, I wouldn't purchase it. Same goes for pets and the transmog helmets, far from everyone buys them all. Just because you repeat something in a sarcastic tone, doesn't make it true nor does it make you clever. Hint. <br />
<br />
Again, pissy people being angry about silly stuff, THAT is the point of all this. If we hadn't been in a content holdup right now, people like you would have found other reasons for being angry over other people spending cash on something YOU don't deem worthy of it.

Precisely the problem with the attitude of many players. <br />

I remember the dude saying that &quot;If the Zulian Tiger came back, I would stop using it because then everyone could just go get it!!&quot;.../facepalm. That mount...I'd have used that mount daily even if 50 other players were riding on it behind me...guess it's a gift being able to enjoy something for yourself rather than needing other peoples envy/impressed comments or whatever to get by.</div></div><hr />

Oh come on now. Quit. I don't like it either, but more-so, because I'd like to earn it instead. Quit if you think this is a misstep.

It becomes a normal mount, you get it, learn it and then you get the hitching post in the mail. The post puts a buff on other players that makes ALL mounts they use for 20 minutes, a Warforged Nightmare horsie. The buff can be clicked away at any time and the post has a 3 minute CD.</div></div><hr />

People acting as if a company making money around a game and players spending money on products for that game = distributing and buying meth or something...or selling loaded weapons to kids. <br />

Hey if you think the practice of selling premium content while charging a box fee and sub is on the up and up, thats on you. To me and A LOT of other people it is shady as fuck. Its sad really I used to love this game but their inability to push out content at a pace competitive with FREE games while charging for mounts and pets has pushed me and my entire guild away. <br />
But you keep on buying those mounts, I am sure they will keep making them for you. I am also sure they will see if they cant get you to shill out more and more money for them.</div></div><hr />

9 months of not a single piece of content, except a store mount that costs more than all expansions up to MOP itself. <br />

That mean they expect to sell 20% less then usual , so they compensate through price. For every player left the forum heroes come here and say &quot; you won't be missed&quot;.<br />

But when enough will leave , you will start feeling it directly on your credit card , cause you must be milked harder by Blizzard . Same for the price of the new expansion. Now with 20% more expensive as usual .</div></div><hr />

I'mma keep being happy with the game and hopefully with the store items they make, if I stop being happy with the product in such a way that I wouldn't feel like paying for it all, then I'd quit...and guess what, you wouldn't see me out here acting as if what I did was a major political stand. ;d.<br />

Depends on how touchy people are I suppose, AND whether or not that person has something else he/she does besides playing this game. 9 months of pause in content hasn't dampened my fun though, I frankly doubt I'll manage to get all the stuff I want to do done before WoD hits. Middle finger to you? Perhaps...not to me though. The expansion will come when it comes...and 2 months later, people will again be moaning on forums about how Devs spend time on doing everything but releasing new content that THEY want.</div></div><hr />

With the extra money they make from this can they hire some more artists and model designers to implement some of the thing players have been requesting but told they can't have because of time constraints and 'it would cost a raid tier'.</div></div><hr />

The worst came with the Sparklepony though, it seems to have mellowed out but it sparks up with every new store item. Some people even taking it upon themselves to bully people in-game seen riding/wearing store items.<br />
<br />
So, I guess those Iphone games made for kids, that has in game purchases isn't morally skewed at all. Oh okay.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And it costs $5 more! Just like this upcoming expansion will cost us $10 more and right after the EU has had a price increase on nearly every character service across the board.<br />
<br />
They missed an opportunity to implement this mount into the game and make it obtainable by actually playing the game. But nah, that might have cut into WoD development time or cost us another raid tier, because it's not like $14.99 a month for the past 10 months with zero new content counts for anything.<br />
<br />
Considering the that current Alpha testing consists of a single zone, one faction and two levels, you can bet on this content drought stretching on for at least another 4-5 months. So in the end, the $30 mount makes sense - they've got to make up for the loss of people dropping from the game due to Blizzard's complete mismanagement of time and resources.<br />
<br />
The fact that they actually made a commercial for the mount makes it all the more pathetic.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I made a video explaining why the Warforged Nightmare means epic things for WoW Visuals (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLPGgg5yxh0), but the gist is this:<br />
- Imagine everyone mounting up and charging forward in battlegrounds or outside the raid portal.<br />
- Now imagine the store helm (a new one) has an on-use effect to give you a transmog (head to feet).<br />
- Say that transmog is &quot;Defender of the Alliance&quot; with silver and blues and lions, and something appropriate for the Horde.<br />
- Now imagine that the hitching post is a statue with that transmog.<br />
- Click the statue and you get that temporary transmog.<br />
- Now you're all wearing the same armor, on the same mount = epic (optional) visual.<br />
- Tabards could be improved, because in the same armor and mount, what differentiates is gender, species, and guild.<br />
- The visual gestalt of a united front, even just the five-man version seen in the video, gives me a spine tingle, which I think is a good thing.</div></div><hr />

Not everyone some people have scruples. But, yeah another store mount added to the game without any new content, I'm guessing 2 more store mounts before WoD drops and at least another pet.

Considering these new store mounts have pretty much 0 impact on expansion release date or raid tiers and all that shit, it really is just an added bonus. Especially seeing as its optional to buy and has nothing to do with actual gameplay, purely aesthetic.<br />

Exactly. And even if it is a different team why is there a separate team for store mounts to begin with? 3d models are 3d models. They could pull this team into character models or do moonkin form revamp with this effort. That just isn't an excuse. Is selling 3000 mounts really better than speeding up content production for millions of subscribers?</div></div><hr />
