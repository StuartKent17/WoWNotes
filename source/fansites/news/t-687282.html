End of Arena Season 7 Coming Soon<br />
We are currently planning to end Arena Season 7 as early as January 19. At that point we will go through our normal process to determine who is eligible for the end-of-season rewards. This process should take approximately one week. It's very important for players who feel that they may be eligible for the arena-specific titles and/or Relentless Gladiator’s Frostwyrm to refrain from transferring their character to another realm until after Arena Season 7 ends.<br />
<br />
The following Arena Season will not begin for at least one week after the current season ends. During this time between seasons, all rated matches will be turned off and only skirmishes will be available. When Arena Season 8 begins, all team ratings, personal rating, and arena points will be wiped, but matchmaking rating and honor points will remain. <br />
<br />
Recent In-Game Fixes - January 2010 - 1/5<br />
Listed below are recent fixes we have applied to the game. Keep in mind that some of these changes may not be active until after the realm has been restarted.<br />

1/5/10<br />
The Lady Deathwhisper encounter has seen the following changes in the 25 player normal version: mana pool has been reduced, the health on all adds has been reduced, and Adherents will wait a little longer after spawning before they start casting.<br />
Interrupting a fireball being cast by the Ymirjar Flamebearers in normal and heroic Pit of Saron will no longer make them instantly cast Hellfire.<br />
The ghost waves at the beginning of both normal and heroic Halls of Reflection have undergone several changes that should make them easier to defeat such as preventing 2 mages or 2 mercenaries from spawning in the 5 mob pulls, a shorter duration of the spectral footman’s shield bash, and the spectral mage’s flamestrike having a longer cast time, shorter duration, and (in heroic) doing less damage.<br />

not like doing the random raid every week and doing the random every day prevents scrubs from getting tier 10 because they can it just takes ALOT longer if your not raiding ICC :P so now we have a new loot pinata in voa -_-</div></div><hr />

You have no idea how bad the nerfs are or if they are worth mentioning at all. Define puggable. I could get 25 people that are all in top guilds and clear all the content in the game the moment they are released. If you mean picking up random players from trade, I would say ICC is NOT puggable and even 25man Ulduar before it was trivialized by gear(which every raid is as time goes by).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, I think those Mercenaries are truly the annoying bunch... especially if you don't have anyone that can remove poison. It's kind of like how H-ToC was at first whenever you got the rogue and had no one to remove his fun poison. I was in there on my pally tank the other day and being the only person that could remove it, I just sat there removing it off myself... not like I had a problem holding aggro as a pally against undead :P.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As a holy paladin in all 258+ gear I really came to appreciate that heroic b/c even when running it with guildmates it caused us to pay attention (esp. with the movement bug that caused rogues to step behind the tank and lay some pain).<br />
<br />
However in this day and age Blizzard has made cc (by and large) a thing of the past. HoR fortunately when first released required most groups to resort going back to using cc, which a lot of players forgot their class had such abilities. All too often as a healer in a HoR pug and I've seen the tank suffering from being able to pick up all of the adds and asked dps to cc some of the mobs only to be replied back with &quot;Huh?&quot;, &quot;It lowers my dps&quot;, &quot;lawl&quot;<br />
<br />
HoR is just one of those instances that require all 5 people to work together, as should be the case. However more often than not someone wants to march to the beat of their own drum and aoe around cc'ed mobs, hunters who shoot their trapped targets, blow trinkets/CDs on a mob of a pack of 5 that isn't even the marked kill target, steal aggro, die, and then blame the tank for being bad.<br />
<br />
Oh well, preaching to the choir I'm sure. In short, I'm glad to see the changes for when I pug heroics (which is a daily event) but sad that they aren't enforcing the idea that players need to work together to accomplish tasks. Then again, I guess that's why we have raids.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm withholding judgement until the rest of the instance is available. Letting pugs kill arthas is different than letting pugs get past the second - second! boss. Let them kill her, get the loot pinata from chess event, err, I mean gunship, and then die screaming on saurfang. <br />
The Naxx statement isn't really that far off - pugs aren't clearing Ulduar, and most fail on twins or anub in TotC (though I barely count that as a 25man raid, I mean really).<br />
<br />
I welcome the Occ changes too - people will say this is due to whining but I'd bet its because Blizz has numbers showing how many people /leaveparty at the start. This is how Blizz fixes these kind of behavior problems.</div></div><hr />

Yes I know the rogues have a version of SS which is fine of course but there was also a known bug that caused mobs of any type, regardless of abilities to sometimes step behind the tank for no reason and then attack.

<br />
<br />
The concept of HoR would have been fine as it was before the random system went into play. Moderate CC turned heroic into a challenge but doable for most groups. Good CC turned it into a snooze. I've done HoR with 3 hunters in a guild run and it was quite possibly the most boring way to do it. We were laughing at how much an effect 3 traps had at the difficulty of the instance and the fact that the traps caused hunters to proc LnL which melted the 1 - 2 free mobs in seconds.<br />
<br />
Why is HoR bad in randoms? Well beyond people failing to CC when they can you also ended up in groups without any CC at all. Had a group with me (DK Tank), shaman, rogue, warrior, and a second DK. It was unplesant when our best CC was chains of ice. I'm not saying that HoR is undoable without CC but the difficulty goes far above what most random groups can handle.<br />
<br />
When I do HHoR with guildmates I specifically seek out a hunter, priest, or paladin for the group.</div></div><hr />

So you and your group is going in there with all ilvl 219/232 gear? (mostly ilvl 219) and clearing it?<br />
<br />
I agree I love the place, but we our gear it quite easily, and its still requires at least a little bit of paying attention.<br />
<br />
To do the place with a gear appropriate tank/heals and dps would be considerable difficult, especially getting 2 of the mentioned classes in the 5 packs. That being said I do hope that they don't nerf it to hard.</div></div><hr />

The encounter was fine, it required moderate organization and dps / tanks to be somewhat awake. Why are they nerfing encounters when there aren’t hard modes available? Everyone is 4/4 ICC now it's not like she is holding back a large number of raiders.<br />

Unfortunately, the player base have changed drastically in recent years.<br />
<br />
When WOW first came out, gamers are mainly elitist/hardcore. Today, thanks to Nintendo, every player in the industry came to realize that the amount of casuals in the gaming audience have been increased by ten-folds, and at the same time, they can make a lot of money from them. They are the majorities now, and still there is a lot more of them that can be brought into the WOW game. All of these does not even yet consider the fact that casuals can be converted to hardcores, and vice-versa.<br />
<br />
This is a reality, its all about money.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The nerfs won't make it easy, but at least you can do it with a not so well arranged group. Most Guilds I know had to get their members to at least ilvl 240+ to down her (next to the movement). Compared to the 10 man it was too hard :)<br />
<br />
For the HDR nerfs ... GREAT! And the min. EQ lvl was raised too!<br />
<br />
I played tank, dps and heal in there and I have to say, it's quite easy for a tank or dps. Sure, to get and hold the aggro as tank can be difficult, but it's not THAT bad. For the heal it's hell - next to massive AOE DMG you get all sorts of debuffs that need to be dispelled, hardcore tank dmg etc. 2 mages on a tank with the 50% more magic dmg debuff from the hunter and a low equiped heal couldnt even think about healing against it.<br />
<br />
No chance ...<br />
<br />
I had so many wipes in there already. Well - best runs I had so far were with a shaman heal (got one too) because he can dispel the debuffs, got some totem for cleaing, resist etc.<br />
<br />
Pala had the hardest time...<br />
<br />
Still, as a shaman with low gear I had massive problems in there - actually pdok or icc is easier to heal than this hc ...</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sulika</div><div class="date">2010-01-06, 02:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">HoR was really no more difficult to tank than any other heroic as a DK. I am sure as a paladin it was much the same. You just drop your AoE in one of the doorways and wait for the mobs to come to you. As a warrior it was a lot harder, due to the spread out way the mobs appear you can't usually pick them up with AoE (that 5 second cooldown on thunderclap is an eternity when there are 2 melee mobs running to the healer) and had to pick them up one by one. Once you got the hang of it it wasn't too bad and the strengths of warrior tanking really come into their own there, spell reflect, shield block, demo shout being used in a heroic again but I could certainly see some warrior players having a hard time there.<br />
<br />
Deathwhisper nerf. Depending on the magnitude of the nerf it is quite possible that phase 1 zerg could end up becoming the dominant strategy. My own guild tried it a few times, we just couldn't quite trigger phase 2 before the 3rd wave of adds. I am sure better geared guilds could have managed that already. If the nerf is 20%+ then I expect it would be quite easy, zerg phase 1, aoe down two waves of adds, enjoy your free epics.<br />
<br />
I am not really expecting to see icecrown pugged widely in the forseeable future, the biggest block to pugging it is going to be the amount of time it takes. You are going to be looking at an instance that will take 4 hours plus to clear, for most people that means two nights raiding and that is pretty much the deathknell for pugs. That is the intention of the 3rd phase of icecrown nerfs, when the boss health and damage slowly deteriorate. It will be to reduce the raid time and make it more puggable. Normal mode icecrown however is not going to be particularly difficult but the time factor is enough to keep most PUGs away for now. I suspect the second wing is going to be about the upper limit of what most PUGs will manage in a night. Yeah you can go back the second day to finish it but in reality half the people from the PUG won't show up and most others won't want to skip the easier earlier bosses for a chance at the later ones which will make it harder to fill up the raid.</div></div><hr />

If people are still complaining about that fact, you should seriously consider quitting the game. There is no QQ anymore in public forums because Blizzard swings the mighty hammer of nerf faster than people could open a topic like in the past. At days where pugs are clearing TOC 25 Heroic without problems and Yogg + 0 is waiting for getting pugstomped, the only thing you can do is hide in your cave whining about the days of Bolten More and STFU.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The nerfs won't make it easy, but at least you can do it with a not so well arranged group. Most Guilds I know had to get their members to at least ilvl 240+ to down her (next to the movement). Compared to the 10 man it was too hard :)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Indeed, you should be able to clear it with gear two tiers lower. ICC is just ridiculous. Why can't i do an instance wich drops ilvl 264 with ilvl 232 gear while watching tv and turning my brain off?<br />
<br />
<br />
Isn't it obvious you HAVE to go back to ToC before doing ICC?</div></div><hr />

People will still leave instance regardless of nerfs and loot boosts. Many players don't like it and nothing will change that. I think Oculus is great, different dungeon, uncommon mechanics, multidimensional =), combination of normal and drakes combat. It was easily doable in 3.0, before drake-gear-boosts, nerfs (when 5x amber was something bit challenging). Anyway everytime I get there I don't mind people leaving it, only means good players will stay and we'll make it quicker.<br />
Edit: after all the nerfs and gear upgrade you don't even need proper tank<br />
<br />
Not bad solution would be to set kinda cooldowns after players leaving. <br />
I don't know Finder's mechanics, but there is moment when specific players from queue and dungeon are chosen. Would be good if person who left e.g. oculus before would not be able to get there for next 2-3 tries/hours/days (could also put them in end of queue). Before Finder was implemented players not intereseted in it were simply not going there - make them leave and not allow to come back for longer time for both - ours (ppl who stayed) and their (leavers) good.<br />
This would kinda work as well for tanks farming Hilts in HoR (someone wrote about it earlier). They leave it should be harder to get there back for them.<br />
<br />
Shamans<br />
I just can't stand reading shammies moaning about BL drums, shittness of their class, raid invitations ending for them, etc. Few examples:<br />
<br />
Wrath of Air totem is only (not replacable) 5% spell haste buff :O<br />
Improved Earth Strength Totem is ultimate/best Agi/Str combination buff giving 178 of both (instead of 155 Horn of Winter) - you max professions to get 40 mor str and 23 agi/str for each raid member is nothing?<br />
Drums: Look at the kings/motw drums - they not as good as origin ones. Drum Kings do 8% instead of 10%, so BL drums will prolly last 30secs or give 30% of haste, or both! <br />
It will be just good addition to some 5/10 setups which can't get the shammy.<br />
Only problem could be with cooldowns when people in pugs use it with no sense, and it's hard to say who used it.<br />
Restos are imba raid healers, Ancestral Healing giving fulltime 10% damage reduction oO<br />
<br />
Plus many others like 280sp no matter what, 5%crit for spell, etc.<br />
Any good player will get invite to raid in sense guild. Dps is not everything, and even if gearing up (to make dps more than enough for top content) is easier than ever. Go Oculus for extra badges.<br />
<br />
Nerfing ICC<br />
No comment. Just thinking either Blizzard is stupidly blind or this is intended to make Wow1.0 die slowly.<br />

There's nothing elitist about wanting a challenge.<br />
And since Blizzard is FORCING this tripe on us for weeks, before we can even access heroic. <br />
There should be at least some brain activity required to do the encounters.<br />
<br />
So far it's an absolute bore.<br />
<br />
Ulduar normal modes were so much more fun and even offered some challenge on release. Then even after they nerfed it into the ground there still was decent challenge.<br />
<br />
<br />
Really. Games are meant to be PLAYED not watched, my friend. <br />
<br />
I'm truly sorry you don't enjoy playing games that offer any degree of challenge. <br />
Even more sorry that you are pissy about those who do.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I agree that there's nothing wrong with wanting a challenge. Challenge is good.<br />
<br />
What IS a problem is a mass c**kblock that impedes a lot of people from seeing important content on the easiest difficulty available, especially when it's the second goddamn boss out of twelve. If you're going to put in a roadblock, you don't do it at the front door. You do it near or at the end (Arthas), and you do it to all non-trivial content (hard modes).<br />
<br />
People bitching about how easy normal ICC is should find something constructive to do.<br />
<br />
Roll an alt with the new Dungeon Finder (zomg it's awesome if your battlegroup doesn't suck).<br />
Get a hobby.<br />
<br />
If you really want to prove how 1337 you are...<br />
http://74.125.95.132/search?q=cache:http://greedygoblin.blogspot.com/2009/08/ungeared.html<br />
<br />
Try something like that. Tackle Uld, ToC, or even ICC while severely under-geared. Figure out where your skill ends and your gear begins. Clear Naxx in vendor-sold white gear if you're that good.<br />
<br />
Everyone, even the PUGs deserve to see all the content if they can pass the most basic of competency checks. If lady deathwhisper was preventing that (preventing people from seeing the airship battle no less!) then her normal mode deserves a nerf.<br />
<br />
...I do hope her hard mode is soul-crushing though.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xiangu</div><div class="date">2010-01-07, 04:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Now that they nerfed Deathwhisper those pugs will be able to go to the flying battle and finally face Deathbringer where they will ultimately fail. When I first read that change I thought &quot;Why did they nerf this piss-easy fight when Deathbringer is so much more difficult (given you have either retards in your raid or just not enough dps and you will really want to bring a LOT) but then I realised.. sure.. if those raids already failed at Deathwhisper they can't possibly know how miserably they would fail at Deathbringer.. <br />
<br />
That being said.. Deathbringer nerf inc. as soon as those idiots get to him and realise how easy Deathwhisper was :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
Probably around 5, seeing as Valithria Dreamwalker fight will take 45 minutes+ except for hardcore groups (the achievment, last time I checked, was heal her to full in 30 minutes, so I assume much higher for a regular kill). Healing a raidboss to full would be a bitch, no matter what hp she was at.</div></div><hr />
