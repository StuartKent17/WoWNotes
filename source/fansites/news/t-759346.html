You got your answer, and hopefully people won't yell at me if something goes wrong. <br />

Gathering professions now give XP<br />
This is an intentional change, however the values may not be final. Tradeskill nodes are intended to give you experience when you loot them.<br />

Bastion of Twilight - Twilight Ascendant Council<br />
The last member of the Twilight Ascendant Council had its model updated in the latest build. This encounter definitely looks promising.<br />

Mimiron's Head/Invincible in 4.0<br />
Ghostcrawler's stated idea to make such things really low drop rates is still a real possibility. Whether or not this change will take effect with patch 4.0.1 is to be determined. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26726036315/4-0-and-invincible-mimiron-s-head-etc/))<br />
<br />
Flying in Azeroth<br />
Flying in Azeroth will not be possible until your account is upgraded to Cataclysm. Patch 4.0.1 is slated to be released prior to Cataclysm and will not include the changes to the old world or any content exclusive to Cataclysm. This patch will apply many systems, class, and user interface changes. It's very similar in nature to the major patches which preceded the releases of The Burning Crusade and Wrath of the Lich King. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26725676005/how-do-we-fly/))<br />
<br />
Raid/Dungeons Content Difficulty<br />
You are correct that a lot of players moan about things being too easy without having seen the content personally. We definitely place less emphasis on their feedback than on people who have actually tried those encounters.<br />
<br />
The hardest encounters of LK were harder than anything we've offered before. And honestly, that point isn't often in contention. I think what surprised players is say how far they got in Naxxramas on their very first night, without a lot of planning or gearing, or how they managed to kill 2-3 heroic bosses on their first night of a new heroic wing being opened in Icecrown (though to be honest, fighting a boss for weeks on normal mode first definitely exacerbates that phenomenon).<br />
<br />
We'll continue to offer some content for the cutting-edge progression raider. There is an encounter in Bastion of Twilight for them. But we also think true pugs shouldn't be stumbling their way through encounters they've never seen before, at least without a very strong or experienced leader.<br />
<br />
To use my own guild as an example, in say the Serpentshrine days, we'd take a few weeks to master a new boss. I could probably count the number of time we got two new bosses on one night. I think a progression rate like that feels better to a lot of players. You spend time in between raid nights discussing what you could do differently on a tough boss, but then celebrate each victory.<br />
<br />
A heroic dungeon doesn't need to be quite so brutal, but it still doesn't seem bad if you wipe on a new boss 2-3 times before you figure out a solid stragegy and everything falls into place. A lot of players love that puzzle-solving aspect of the encounters. It lets them exercise their mind, creativity and knowledge of game mechanics. When you can just overpower the boss and ignore the encounter mechanics, then a lot of that is lost. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26725725600/actual-videos-of-level-85-healing-on-beta/))<br />
<br />
Class balance on PTRs<br />
Most likely not. We'll be evaluating the way players are performing in content on the 4.0.1 test realms, but keep in mind the class changes are balanced around level 85 gameplay. It's almost more likely we'd end up taking away the Icecrown Citadel buff (I'm only saying this is a possibility), as in many cases healing, tanking, and damage dealing may stand to benefit a lot from these changes at level 80.<br />
<br />
Things will be a little bit interesting since these changes are being applied while players are still actively working through the current Wrath of the Lich King content. Bear with us and provide as much feedback as you can about your experiences with these changes under the current content, but keep in perspective that the new class design is meant to be balanced around the upcoming Cataclysm content. We're more interested in ironing out bugs and polishing the systems than attempting to balance them intricately for level 80 gameplay.

<br />
Using all your healing spells<br />
This is a very common line of argument we see from players, especially healers. It runs something like &quot;I use all my heals. I seem to be a pretty good healer. Therefore only using a few heals makes you a bad healer.&quot; It should make you a bad healer (if our numbers are appropriate) but often it does not. Often those 1-2 spells can take you 90% of the way there and the additional heals used my more savvy players only adds 10% or so optimization on top of that. You might have been a better paladin for using all of your toolbox, but the fact is that even very mediocre paladins could heal just fine using only those two buttons. That's not what we are going for. If you're used to using a variety of spells, then this change won't affect you much. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26725675201/holy-paladin-nerfs-12942/))<br />
<br />
Making healing more challenging<br />
We see the sentiment expressed often that making healing more challenging might drive players away. That is a risk, but the flip side is that making healing more engaging might attract some players who find it boring today.<br />
<br />
While it has always been a goal to make World of Warcraft approachable to a lot of different kinds of players, including those who found traditional MMOs too hardcore, we'd rather retain players because the gameplay is fun than because the gameplay is easy.<br />
<br />
Taking your argument to a probably illogical conclusion, if we made healing even easier, we might get even more players to heal. Is that really good for the game as a whole though? (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26725726427/i-like-to-dig-ditches-at-least-right-now/))<br />
<br />
Lack of healers in the Dungeon Finder in Cataclysm?<br />
Players played WoW for six years without Dungeon Finder though. Dungeon Finder is awesome, don't get me wrong, and I spent a lot of time personally working on it. But the intent is not to be able farm dungeons as fast as you possibly can.<br />
<br />
Healing (and tanking as well) isn't for everyone. It takes the right kind of mindset. I know there are players who want to make healing and tanking super easy in an attempt to adjust the ratios of dps to tanking and healing. There are also some who just want to get rid of the healing role completely.<br />
<br />
None of those are our goals though. We want to make healing fun for healers, not make healing so easy that anyone can jump in without any fear of failure.<br />
<br />
I remember looking for Scholomance or Shadow Labs pugs for literally 2-3 hours. There is almost no chance of that ever happening again now that we have Dungeon Finder, even if tanking and healing require a little more finesse.<br />
<br />
So to answer your question, I think having more healers available at any cost is bad for the game. We want healing to be fun for people who like healing. If that means the mages and rouges have to wait 15 minutes for Dungeon Finder instead of 5 minutes, I think we can live with that. If nothing else, fast Dungeon Finder queues (or ease in finding a raid slot, etc.) remain attractive benefits of tanking and healing.

70% spell pushback<br />
Hopefully they just make the 70% baseline for everyone with no pushback with earth shield or concentration aura type spells. Spell pushback is one of those things that can really drive you crazy in both PvP and PvE. :(<br />
We did. We just changed the base pushback resistance so that we didn't have to duplicate the same passive bonus in every tree. <br />
<br />
Tanking / Crusader Strike<br />
If CS and HotR are meant to be single/multi-target counterparts, then they should both hit as the same type of damage. Since CS is stuck as physical due to Ret using it, HotR should probably be switched to physical as well. Mana cost of HotR seems lower than it should be, compared to CS.<br />
We want Prot paladins to be able to swap between Shield of the Righteous and Inquisition when going from single-target to AE tanking. One of the mechanics that lets that work is Hammer of the Righteous being improved by Holy damage.<br />
<br />
Crusader Strike should win handily against single targets. If it's not doing that yet it's just a numbers adjustment, so you'd be better off testing as if it were the case rather than trying to build a rotation based around something that you know we're likely to change.

Note that I am not one of those people who complain, I do complain about numbing down the game too much which in my opinion makes a lot of it unnecessarily boring.<br />
<br />
The point however is not that there is heroic mode available. The point is that the content available for those who cannot do heroic mode raids, or even raids at all, feels pointless and too easy. There is no goal to achieve, no dailies to do (any more, and when they were, I remember there was more complains than there was love for, say, the Hodir dailies), the heroic 5mans have been done so often nobody can really be bothered anymore but does it anyway because else they cannot get gear.<br />
<br />
That's the point. I agree with Ghostcrawler that sure the game should be accessible for everyone, and I also don't think we should get back to a model where raiding, except the first tier raiding, is only for those who play 24/7. But that doesn't mean you should ignore the content available outside raids, too. And currently, that content is next to non-existant in WOTLK, except old faceroll stuff nobody, not even those casuals who play since LK's release, is interested in doing.<br />
<br />
Not only this, it's not like there's nothing in between &quot;completely casual&quot; (read: noob) and &quot;elitist jerk pro dude&quot;. For a lot of people, ICCheroic is not realistic, but ICCnormal is such a huge faceroll that it's not fun, either. At the same time, the huge nabs, like those I ran with in a pug not too long ago, barely get past Saurfang still despite the 30% buff. The point is that making something the right difficulty for every player is ongoing and challenging, but that there's limits and extremes, and that there should probably be less focus on the endgame raids and more focus on outside content as well.</div></div><hr />

The point is that making something the right difficulty for every player is ongoing and challenging, but that there's limits and extremes, and that there should probably be less focus on the endgame raids and more focus on outside content as well.<br />
<br />
<br />
Having raids faceroll for everyone and heroic versions for the better guilds is a perfectly fine model and everyone is happy as they see content, they just need to up the heroic loot far superior to the normal loot and then you can make heroic actually heroic all the way through instead of making 3/4 of the heroic versions still faceroll.<br />
<br />
With this model still in mind MAKE MANY MORE 5-6 BOSS RAIDS! I just dont want to farm the same instance week in week out for gear again.<br />
<br />
I want to see at least 3 raids every major content patch consisting of 4-5 bosses so I have major choice cullminating into the epic end instance of the expansion utilising a wing style layout or even a kind of Black temple layout when the whole instance changes as you progress.<br />
<br />
Learn by your mistakes blizzard and learn by your sucess.<br />
<br />
Black temple - Magtheridon - Serpentshrine - Tempest keep - ALl great instances.<br />
Trial of the Grand crusade was clever and would of been awesome if it had a complimentary other raid to go with it the lack of other choice made it cringe worthy.<br />
Ulduar was fantastic just maybe a little long.<br />
<br />
<br />
TLDR version - Many more shorter raids and make heroic mean heroic please.</div></div><hr />

Make them vicious bitches, both figuratively and literally. Get the worgen mounts out too, and they don't need to be pretty either. Worgen fans might look at a half-wolf-pig-dog mutant thing and QQ until their eyes bleed, or they might actually get somehting &quot;cute&quot;.

<br />
You might have been a better paladin for using all of your toolbox, but the fact is that even very mediocre paladins could heal just fine using only those two buttons. That's not what we are going for. If you're used to using a variety of spells, then this change won't affect you much. (Source)<br />
<br />
Erm - since when have Paladins had variety of healing spells before? 5 years of 2 button healing and they should have experience of exactly what else?<br />
What ppl are critising is that the new spells are not intresting enough to make them a rotation heal (true situatinal heal) but rather a one time slap that is used so sparingly that its really not worth having there. <br />
<br />
Secondly - regarding lack of healers in Dungeon finder. Healing IS already the most challenging part of WOW. DPS is the easiest part by miles. So there should be ways to make DPS more challenging - let them have more of a debuff role - where it is a must to debuff at the cost of doing pure dps. <br />
<br />
I think that what GC is trying to avoid saying is that healing at this point in time is the ONLY way Blizzard have to control raid and group difficulties. So by making healing harder - they are making the overall content harder. That will NOT make healing more populare. And it will probably leave more players left out for seeing the content because lack of healers. <br />
<br />
I suggest GC should take an entire week playing healer for 3-4 hours per day in challenging content + working full time job. It takes alot more out of you cause your attention span needs to be 110% all the time. Thats why alot of healers get burned out. And it will increase again if they are gonna base the raid progression mainly on healing difficulty.</div></div><hr />

As a long time dps, i would agree, i have played dps/tank/healer in icc25, my honest opinion is that tanking is the hardest part, you have to grab aggro with no rage from triggerhappy dps. the next level of difficulty is healing, you have to watch everyone at all times, no slacking or they die. And on the buttom is dps, many can slack with some kind of aoe spam, if dps had to debuff and cc they would approach healing in difficulty. I really wonder what kind of game GC is playing, because dps is the easy part, and he is talking about making it more &quot;interesting&quot; ie. harder for healers, does he think that healers are easier off than dps? I seriously dont get it.</div></div><hr />

On the first part: I think currently tanking is the most easy role. Especially in ICC. You have barely any movement needed. You just try to do lots of aggro, which is not all that difficult. <br />
<br />
DPS is hard if you want to max your damage and keep that needed movement in mind. The main difference between healing and dps is, that as a dps you don't have the responsibility to keep the raid alive. As a healer you do have this responsibility. Due to that you get the feeling successfull raids depend more on good healing than anything else. <br />
<br />
And that leeds me to your second part. I totally aggree with you on that. <br />
<br />
On my note: I do raid as Tank and DPS and used to as a healer. If I want to have an easy Raid Night, I'll tank. If I want to have fun, I play my hunter or DK dd. And I only play a healer if one is needed and noone else can take that role because on my part healing just isn't any fun.</div></div><hr />

Its not the difficulty that burns a player out, in my experience. Its the required amount of attention to the game. A tank that loses aggro for 5 sec can wipe a raid, a healer that loses attention for 5 sec puts more pressure on the other healers, and a dps that loses attention for 5 sec, loses a bit of dps ie. not a big deal. So please stop defending the inherent lazyness of dps. I have played the same mage for 5 years, and its true that to max dps, you must use every ability at the right time, BUT you can slack for 10 sec and you still kill the boss, and no one would even notice it. NOT so for healers and tanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As someone who plays all 3, and personally i think im a terrible tank, average dps and good healer. The Tank losing aggro for 5 seconds may wipe a raid, but honestly on some fights that is never going to happen we could go through all the fights in ICC but i'd wager that for the first few seconds if you dont have tricks or MD then it can be hard to hold aggro but after the first minute or so you could literally get up go a wee and come back and still have aggro, which is why they're doing the whole threat degenerative thingie , the hard part of tanking is definitely the positioning and some fights are difficult to tank, LK for a start. And putting pressure on other healers if you slack? it depends how many you can take but most ICC HC modes we 2 heal with pala and priest me being the priest(holy or disc depending on what i like best for the encounter) if i slack, raid dies. But yea in 25 mans i can slack a lot more and it will be on someone else. And like you say, dpsing is faceroll easy, but then i dont have an RDPS and ours always manage to wipe us at least one on BC HC 25 due to missing an orb -_-.<br />
<br />
TLDR: First 5 seconds of tanking hard then they can slack, healing 10 mans=hard 25=easy. dps always faceroll</div></div><hr />

Na. That's too close to Xmas. Even if everything's broken it'll be the end of November at the latest. Then they'll just patch it until it's fixed. The 2nd seems reasonable, that's still 2 months away, plenty of time to finish.</div></div><hr />

one encounter ... :\<br />
<br />
and for healers that is even harder because they need to focus on raid frames doing almost no-stop healing and controlling that<br />
<br />
yes i'm a healer and a ranged dps (lock), doing dps after being healer is boring has hell and easy has cake in ICC even that i have to switch targets in almost all encounters (and yes, talking heroic mode) when melees dps almost dont do anything :D that is the ones in ICC that fall asleep<br />
<br />
in Cataclysm:<br />
-&gt; healing more harder, fine :D<br />
-&gt; dps has to do CC, reallyyyy nice. something interesting to do and control instead of doing TAB and pressing 4 or 5 buttons<br />
-&gt; tanking ... lets see</div></div><hr />

I'm afraid Pottery isn't to my liking. However, the mount was a reward for a 'difficult' accomplishment. One that some people still struggle with now (lol). Not for people to go back on 3 tiers later/Expansion Later and faceroll it.<br />
<br />
I'm assuming with your reply you have 0 Lights completed back when it was challenging... right? If they put an item in the game, even for cosmetic purposes, from doing something that was considered 'very difficult', then it kind of loses its value if you're allowed to go back and walk over it without paying attention.<br />
<br />
They took out the Black Proto drake and the Plagued Proto Drakes to prevent people achieving them tiers above. Hell, they even took out the ZA bear. Neither of the above were 'difficult' to achieve even in their original state.</div></div><hr />

This is the stumbling point for me. You might find it funnier to play, because you actually care, but most dps are on a little powertrip and that doesnt translate well to the healing game. And making it harder is fine for people running hardmodes, but how are newbies gonna start healing.</div></div><hr />

How can you know what is finished? I notice there is ppl here thinking that there is no internal build... for all we know blizzard can have another 4 expansion live on a internal build :P<br />

<br />
This is the stumbling point for me. You might find it funnier to play, because you actually care, but most dps are on a little powertrip and that doesnt translate well to the healing game. And making it harder is fine for people running hardmodes, but how are newbies gonna start healing.<br />
<br />
As a healer i see your point but blizz said that the only diference for healers is that they have to control mana more and select the healing spells better, as dps they will have to learn how to CC and move from bad places<br />
<br />
i personally i'm tired of seeing in raids on even in 5man instances dps stading on dark round circle, or a mob seeding something at them in the air and even with 5 seconds to move they simply stand there and get hit (i dont remember the name of the 5man instance but is like the same mobs to general vexax in ulduar)<br />
<br />
has in this case, a healer can simply heal them all the way, in Cataclysm this wont happen so DPS will need to play better, i for one if i see some dps not caring about getting hit by stuff that he can avoid i will let it die to see if he learns<br />
<br />
its not about getting the game to non-newbie friendly, or to easy, not like that. Its all about making a balanced game that requires new ppl to learn the basic stuff like (bad place to be at, so move)</div></div><hr />

What the blue is saying is that when patch 4.0.1 is released on live servers, world changes and new class/race combinations will not be available. These changes will be made in a later patch, but will still be available to all players, regardless of how many expansions they have.<br />
<br />
Flying in Azeroth, however, will be limited to those who have purchased Cataclysm.<br />
<br />

It's quite likely that Boub has a good handle on the target release date (either from good guesswork or the inside source he sometimes seems to have), but that doesn't mean it will happen. Blizzard is well known for delaying games when beta is not meeting their expectations. Not to say Cataclysm will be delayed, to me it seems like a month and half is enough time to correct remaining issues if they really hustle; but I think that any moderately serious issues popping up now will bust the date. (Yes a month and half, remember they have to produce, package, and ship. They don't actually have two months left to develop and test if they want to make a release in two months.)</div></div><hr />

No, everyone will still see those changes when they go live. <br />
<br />
The PTR does not have many of these changes yet. They're trying to get the new talents and stuff to work with &quot;current&quot; content, since you won't need the expansion to use them. The world-changing patch may have a different version number (4.0.2 or so)<br />
<br />
You will NOT be able to buy the new flying skill to fly in Azeroth without a Cata account, though.</div></div><hr />

Ahn'kahet forgotten one for the ballistic ball of death :p.<br />
<br />
As a healer i now usually use a chronometer to see how much time some dps are able to stay in the big black void zone without noticing it. Well, some managed to stay in it for the full duration, and then blaming me because their hp was doing the yo-yo.<br />
That's when you want to say &quot;hey no problem, you don't need to thank me for saving your life even if you have such a bad case of tunnel vision that you're not able to see you're inside of a huge black circle dealing continuous damage. I for one prefer that you then spend the whole run to insult me and my family instead on focusing on dpsing, or even surviving for that matter, that's what I live for as a healer.&quot;<br />

Does this answer your questions?<br />
<br />
actually that blue post hints at a change of previous statements that cata changes to 1-60 would be available with out cata.<br />
<br />
sounds to me like a Relaunch rather than a Expansion might be incoming.. The streaming client has been delayed for years and still seems abit unfinished by blizzard standards maybe they have given up on it and optedened for a relaunch.<br />
<br />
Maked the boxed copy give you 3months free.. and every one els gets it for free. (make cata completely replace the wow classic Box) and possibly keep TBC and Wrath or make them Digital download.)<br />
<br />
they could handle the cost of a big push like this guys. and lets face it if they want new players they want a simpler system.<br />
<br />
<br />
its ether that or print new Wow classic.. + WoW cata DVDs and confuse new players.<br />
<br />
might sound craze but they would prob save money this way than loose..<br />
<br />
getting a new fresh printed disk in some ones hands rather than have them dl 16gigs of data over a period of time would unlock potential subscription candidates for millions of more people around the world.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;Opt-ins for the public beta began on July 3rd, 2008; the beta began on July 17th. On October 10th, Blizzard announced that Wrath of the Lich King had gone gold and discs were being manufactured for sale;[2] the game itself was released to the public on November 13, 2008.&quot;<br />
<br />
It took them roughly a month from the date they started pressing the discs from the release date. The beta itself was much shorter as well.</div></div><hr />

MMOWNED said a while back that the release date would be 14th - 18th of November. The 2nd sounds a tad soon, so my theory:<br />
<br />
2nd November - Date of the cataclysm; world changes take effect, opening cinematic is shown upon login. No 80-85 content or new races etc accessible.<br />
<br />
16th November - Full Retail launch.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Azrile</div><div class="date">2010-09-13, 04:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are first two things I would like to comment on from GC this time around.<br />
<br />
You might have been a better paladin for using all of your toolbox, but the fact is that even very mediocre paladins could heal just fine using only those two buttons. That's not what we are going for. If you're used to using a variety of spells, then this change won't affect you much. (Source)<br />
<br />
Erm - since when have Paladins had variety of healing spells before? 5 years of 2 button healing and they should have experience of exactly what else?<br />
What ppl are critising is that the new spells are not intresting enough to make them a rotation heal (true situatinal heal) but rather a one time slap that is used so sparingly that its really not worth having there. <br />
<br />
Secondly - regarding lack of healers in Dungeon finder. Healing IS already the most challenging part of WOW. DPS is the easiest part by miles. So there should be ways to make DPS more challenging - let them have more of a debuff role - where it is a must to debuff at the cost of doing pure dps. <br />
<br />
I think that what GC is trying to avoid saying is that healing at this point in time is the ONLY way Blizzard have to control raid and group difficulties. So by making healing harder - they are making the overall content harder. That will NOT make healing more populare. And it will probably leave more players left out for seeing the content because lack of healers. <br />
<br />
I suggest GC should take an entire week playing healer for 3-4 hours per day in challenging content + working full time job. It takes alot more out of you cause your attention span needs to be 110% all the time. Thats why alot of healers get burned out. And it will increase again if they are gonna base the raid progression mainly on healing difficulty.<br />
<br />
I like your point about healing. My personal opinion is this. They are giving all dps a way to heal, and bandages are being made more boss-friendly. They are also making cc more important and if the dps don't do it will it will cause wipes. <br />
<br />
This is all great and would work in theory. But has anyone pugged lately? Do you really think the average dps is going to cc let alone self-heal.<br />
<br />
This is exactly what will happen. Nobody is going to cc effectively, the tank will get swarmed and not be able to be kept alive. At the same time, the dps (who will still be standing in fire) will do nothing to heal themselves. They will use full AOE abilities and the tank who is trying hard to stay alive, will not be able to keep threat on multiple targets (tank aoe threat is being nerfed).<br />
<br />
So what happens is the tank will die from damage from 5 mobs. DPS will die as mobs break free from the tank, and the healer will constantly be OOM. Do you think a rogue will EVER use recouperate on a boss fight?<br />
<br />
After the wipe, the healer will get yelled at for not healing the dps. The tank will get yelled at for not holding aggro.<br />
<br />
Both will stop queing for pugs, and GC will have his old days back of waiting 3 hours to do a dungeon.<br />
<br />
Guild runs are great. Beta is great. The reason is that the average player there has much bigger sense of teamwork. LFD doesn't have that and will fall apart quickly.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree. However, there's not much they can do - it'll be a while before PUGs become reliably successful again, because 1 healer / tank can't just outgear the place. That's WITHOUT the new CC stuff. While the LFD tool does select dungeons based on gearscore, it's not a &quot;skill checker&quot; by any means. <br />
<br />
Seriously, I can remember having 1 or 2 wipes in guild runs of CoT and UP heroic when we first got to lvl 80. Back then, the CoT timer was hard to beat. This was in content which would later become completely faceroll. Even if these new dungeons are as easy as the Wrath ones, you're STILL going to have this happen in the first tier of raiding. In the 2nd tier of raiding, you'll start to get tanks or healers in each group that can turn the whole run into a faceroll anyway - it doesn't matter if DPS are slow to CC if the tank survives and the healer doesn't go OOM.</div></div><hr />

I was here back when Boub predicted that the expansion would be called Cataclysm, Deathwing would be the enemy, Goblin and Worgen would be races. And tbh at the time all of that seemed so unlikely yet he bet he'd run naked in Paris if he was wrong (and got flamed a whole lot). We all know what happened.<br />

<br />
The difference between this time and last time is that for 2 years, everyone has been used to running heroics riding on the back of a tank and using nothing but AOE spells. It is different from before.. at the end of TBC, the average pug was not used to facerolling heroics in 15 minutes. When we got to WotLK dungeons and were appropriately geared, we still remembered how to CC. There are two years worth of new players who have never cc'd in a dungeon.<br />
<br />
The verbal lashing tanks and healers are going to get after every wipe from spoiled dps is going to drive it to the point of making the LFD useless except for 4-man guild runs who pick up a single player for bonus.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They have never announced a release date for any game at Blizzcon, why would they start now? I actually expect that Blizzcon will be much less centered on WoW this time, though there is a small possibility we will see the Cataclysm cinematic there.<br />
<br />
I personally think that Nov 2 seems a bit early, but it will be November for sure. We will have an announced release date from Blizzard by the end of the month at the latest.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As much as I would like to see the November 2 date happen, I tend to agree with krelios. Unless Blizzard is testing a much better build in secret, the current beta just isn't ready yet. Also, we have not seen stores do a pre-order push, no (or not much) advertising, and very little solicitations. December feels more likely. Shame, I'm off the first week of November too ;).</div></div><hr />

People have had plenty of time to go back there and out-gear the encounter as it is. I remember a day where lucrative items such as this were challenging to acquire...<br />
<br />
Honestly no &quot;Lucrative&quot; item should be removed. Why? Because <br />
<br />
1. No one will use that mount once a new lucrative mount takes the scene.<br />
2. Taking it out only supports inflated egos.<br />
<br />
A person with these mounts use them when they are current and up-to-date to show off to those who cannot get one, be they to bad a player, or just unlucky. Yet the second a NEW mount comes out that is even harder to get, they will forget that old one and sit around to flaunt the new one. Only pulling out an older model when they feel it will increase their ego 10 fold. People that get these mounts are not collectors, they just need something to get off on.<br />
<br />
The &quot;only&quot; people who want these kind of mounts taken out are those who are in top guilds and want to run around showing how &quot;Awesome&quot; they are, and how much &quot;better&quot; they are at life over a mount they rightfully do not deserve. True you and everyone else might have worked your ass off for it, but if the only reason to keep it so lucrative is so you can flex your epeen then no, you don't need it.<br />
<br />
Blizzard needs to keep all these mounts in game, never retire them, put them on a vendor with a price tag of 2-5k gold each and call it a day. That way it will kill ego boosting and promote people to work for the next grade of hard to achieve mount. Those that earned it the right way will have it a hell of a lot longer than those who won't see it till the next expansion or so.<br />
<br />
TL;DR - Stop being greedy</div></div><hr />

<br />
In the past there has always been a big WoW announcement of an expansion or something, but with most of the Cata information known and a release set very shortly after Blizzcon there is little to reveal.<br />
<br />
While they'll have the lore panels and people can try Cataclysm etc etc, there is not expected to be any huge WoW announcements besides the Cata cinematic, and most of the buzz is around the final Diablo 3 class, some more gameplay footage and a release date, as well as information on the SC2 expansions.<br />
<br />
We could also hear about the new MMO. WoW won't be so prioritised this Blizzcon.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If they're targeting such an early date at this time, the beta must be more or less finished minus balance changes in their internal build. And there's no way we'll see it much later than the 15th.</div></div><hr />

On more important news, heard about the gathering XP profession which is nice, but curious how it'll work out with Chinese farmers &amp; etc. Release date seems odd, but hey Boub, you've come out with good information overall so I'll prepare to drop the cash around that time.

<br />
No way they have SCII devs working on Cataclysm right now. You've clearly never worked software development. Crunch time is the worst possible time to bring in a whole bunch of new faces who don't really know the product or the development cycle. I keep saying this: software development is not a zero sum game. Having more people and more money doesn't directly translate into having a game faster or it being better. More people always help, and allow you to tackle more ambitious projects, but just throwing people at problems usually doesn't work. It would take far more time and resources to integrate the SCII team then to let the current team finish as is (though if they lose people, having a few replacements from the SCII team on tap would probably be fine.)<br />
<br />
As to missing the Christmas market... wouldn't be the first time. Blizzard is known for not releasing games till they're ready, and BC was delayed in *precisely* the manner you describe. Not that I don't think they *hope* to get the Christmas market, nor that I think they'll miss whatever their target date is that badly, but they *will* push it back to January if they think they have too. Missing the Holiday release isn't a big a deal with a game like this anyway. The user base is already established. Most of us will buy the game whenever it comes out. At most the Holidays will give them a little bump.</div></div><hr />

As a healer i now usually use a chronometer to see how much time some dps are able to stay in the big black void zone without noticing it. Well, some managed to stay in it for the full duration, and then blaming me because their hp was doing the yo-yo.<br />
That's when you want to say &quot;hey no problem, you don't need to thank me for saving your life even if you have such a bad case of tunnel vision that you're not able to see you're inside of a huge black circle dealing continuous damage. I for one prefer that you then spend the whole run to insult me and my family instead on focusing on dpsing, or even surviving for that matter, that's what I live for as a healer.&quot;<br />
<br />
(Yes that really happened....sadly)<br />
<br />
Sadly we might see alot more of these insults in Cata. DPS expects to do nothing but DPS in 5 man dungeons. If someone dies - its always the healer who takes the blame - and harder content (controlled by healing) will lead to more deaths - more healers beeing insulted - and even fewer healers playing the game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
We'll continue to offer some content for the cutting-edge progression raider. There is an encounter in Bastion of Twilight for them. But we also think true pugs shouldn't be stumbling their way through encounters they've never seen before, at least without a very strong or experienced leader.<br />
<br />
To use my own guild as an example, in say the Serpentshrine days, we'd take a few weeks to master a new boss. I could probably count the number of time we got two new bosses on one night. I think a progression rate like that feels better to a lot of players. You spend time in between raid nights discussing what you could do differently on a tough boss, but then celebrate each victory.<br />
<br />
So WHAT are you trying to say?! Was it too hard in TBC? Is it too hard now? Is it too easy now? Will we see any change for Cata raids? Are they going to be harder or easier? WHAT?<br />
<br />
This is the thypical politician answer, where you simply just leave the questions unanswered and just STATE fact that is already stated.<br />
<br />
You say: You don't think PUGs should have problems with encounters they have never seen before... Atleast if they DON'T have a good leader? WHAT? Does that even make sense?<br />
<br />
You end up telling us that you prefer raid progress where bosses are conquered on different occations, where guilds have to redo tacts etc in between the raids. Yea, sounds good to me. BUT! You just said that you prefer raids where raids don't should have problems. <br />

<br />
You mean they have some secret version thats actually finished somewhere?<br />
<br />
Beta has 2 zones that don't have any quest rewards and that are only half completed quest wise (only 60-65 quests in the zones while the achievements say complete 1xx quests in said zone). Bugged quests that phase people out where they can't get new quests and can't go back to do the ones in the other phases. Casters and healers going OOM within 20 seconds. Instance bosses that bug and make you have to run and zone out to reset it and hope it's not bugged next pull. And many other issues. If they can fix all that in a month and a half great but i find it hard to believe.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not &quot;finished&quot;, but they absolutely have a version of Cata that's not the same as the one on the beta realm. By the time the game is pressed onto DVDs it will be different than the one that beta testers saw last. Of course they saw most of the stuff but with the amount of design being done on this game it isn't possible (or necessary) to keep the beta realm current.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Personally I believe Boubouille's information is probably pretty close if not exact. He provides us *awesome* info constantly and is very rarely wrong. I bet we have a Blizzard announcement within the next week.<br />
<br />
Also, in regard to Blizzcon... I'm sure Cata will be a topic and probably a fully playable version at the convention (full release version probably). I think SC2 expansion almost certainly. New Diablo 3 class (the last one left to announce I believe). Maybe the Cataclysm cinematic if it's not out by then. I'm still shocked that Cata won't be out before Blizzcon.</div></div><hr />

I'm inclined to agree with ent0mbed on this one. Boubouille's track record for important information has been amazing, albiet not perfect, but amazing nonetheless. I can understand doubting him, its safer that way, but to flat out say he is wrong is a little too much.

<br />
First of all, they are increasing the damage healers can do. You can't really make healers do as good dps as the real dpsers though as then there would be no point in rolling pure dps classes.<br />
<br />
Secondly, they DID admit they can't really make healing more entertaining for the masses without making it too easy. It just is not possible to cater to both the group who can't heal properly and need to be held by the hand and those who can heal properly and enjoy healing when it's challenging. Those are just too contradictory groups.<br />

It'd be really silly if healing was suddenly made so god damn easy that any kind of a retard could come and keep the group alive without any effort. Atleast now it requires a person who is genuinely interested in such.</div></div><hr />

That's not really the problem either, is it. We're looking at the core of it at this moment - when players get better, and not just in terms of gear, then healing becomes mind-numbingly easier. Everyone looks back at TBC as &quot;the real heroics&quot; where some instances were still challenging long into the end of the expansion - except for the healer's challenge, which *always* lessened when the players did their job right. And at the same time you see healers complaining about those mistakes, complaining about DPS not watching out for avoidable damage and tanks not being properly geared, because it makes their job harder and not always doable. You can't just narrow it down to &quot;there would be no point if healers could-&quot; or &quot;it wouldn't work if healing was too easy-&quot;.<br />

If only there was some way to specialize the classes like say, points you could spend making choices for how your class should excel to satisfy players of different tastes. Talent specs have become incredibly static and lack their original purpose for a very long time. Now that talents are being revamped, now is the time to expand the concept and allow more flexibility in the player's choices other than &quot;Should I go for Cauterize or Blazing Speed for survival&quot;.<br />
<br />
They said they'd get rid of static talents, but going down the talent trees I still see plenty of them. Talents which could have been replaced with actual choices to how you want to play your healer. Here's a suggestion for a talent of such nature; &quot;When you overheal a target, you have a percentage chance to empower your next Smite spell enough to make it worth casting.&quot; Whoops, suddenly topping people off in a boring run would still let the healer take some interest in running the dungeon.<br />
<br />
Alternatively, you can give the healer choices like Paladins are getting with Holy Power. Make them spend their resources, and allow it to be turned into damage if there's not a need for healing at the present moment.</div></div><hr />

Worgen Female STILL haven't been implemented. They require a large amount of time to test new races for any graphical bugs/etc.<br />

So hopefully beta testers will race change immediately to Worgen Female when available to try to help flesh out the bugs ASAP.</div></div><hr />

He provides us *awesome* info constantly and is very rarely wrong. I bet we have a Blizzard announcement within the next week.<br />
<br />
<br />
I totally agree, Boub is usually right about these things and he probably is again this time. I just personally don't think things will be as polished and relatively problem free as we've been use to getting with a date that is almost here and the progress i've seen playing alpha/beta for 5+ months.</div></div><hr />

The thing is... You can play DPS class and be crap at it and still progress. There is no holding hand needed there. Already in current form you will have to show quite a skill to both tank and heal. Mostly because there is just one of those two in 5 man group - but 3 dps. One decent DPS will do the job - even tho the two others are crap. One bad tank or 1 bad healer and the group is going nowhere.<br />
<br />
So... They will not fix anything by making tanking and healing harder. They will have to adress the DPS classes and give them other roles to. CC is ok - but at this point in time like for the last two years - most dps classes only think about toping the dmg meters and that will not change alot with Blizzard making more challenging content for healers and tanks.<br />
<br />
Personally - I think dungeon finder will not work in Cata. PPL will simply give up using it.</div></div><hr />

Beta is still going, and they're still making changes. I would think it would take that long just to get the code burned onto ~9 million disks, packaged and shipped all over the globe. If they do it by Nov. 2nd, I will be impressed.<br />

What has been the historical time between close of beta and release date?</div></div><hr />

From what I recall, I believe 1 or 2 weeks. Then any changes that were done after that were saved for the next &quot;.XX&quot; patch.</div></div><hr />

Dosen't seem like it is. If you have a beta pass. You've seen the amount of beta content there pushing through. In HUGE WAVES. They send a wave out, It's tested. Reported on, then retracted polished and put on hold for it's live release date. November sounds right, they've started the prologue to Cataclysm 8 weeks before November. They've got all the time they need to finish it. November 2nd sounds fairly right. If not it's close as close can get....</div></div><hr />

I would have to agree with this. As of now, there are so many bugs in beta, it's not even funny. Hell, for a while the bug report system itself wasn't even working. As it stands, I'd be disappointed if this released at any point in November, let alone the first week. If this does release November, I think I'd be tempted to by a Frostmourne replica and shove it up Bobby Kotick's...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Burning Crusade:<br />
Announced release date: Nov. 9 2006<br />
Actual release date: Jan 16 2007<br />
Diff: 68 days<br />
Weekday Announced: Thursday<br />
<br />
Lich King:<br />
Announced release date: Sept 15 2008<br />
Actual release date: Nov 13 2008<br />
Diff: 59 days<br />
Weekday Announced: Tuesday<br />
<br />
StarCraft 2<br />
Announced release date: May 3 2010<br />
Actual release date: July 27 2010<br />
Diff: 85 days<br />
Weekday Announced: Monday<br />
<br />
That gives an average of 70 days from Announcement of release date to actual releasedate. Which means that it will be late November / early December 2010</div></div><hr />

Actually they could have burned the CD's already since content gets patched anyway. So basically the only thing that you need on the CD's are stuff that takes alot of space like textures etc. Considering we need to download a 10gb patch before cata I don't really get the point of even giving us cd's.</div></div><hr />
