Class Changes<br />
Talent Balance<br />
<br />
Developer Commentary: A primary focus for class changes in Patch 6.1 is improving overall talent balance. Not every talent needs to be useful in every situation; and in fact it’s often better if they have strengths and weaknesses. But we do try to have each talent be useful in some situations, and make them close enough in value that if you really enjoy the gameplay of a talent you don’t feel like you’re dragging your group down by using it.<br />
<br />
For these changes we focused primarily on tuning (tweaking numbers), and nearly all changes are buffs to underperforming talents. The goal is to reach more variety of viable builds, without bringing down the existing popular choices.<br />

My WOD first class to level: fire mage<br />

It was painful, xp was good as this expansion is easy mode for that but dmg was pathetic, so i thought, ok sego you are 100, everyone can see how bad fire mage dps is. reinforcements arrive!<br />
<br />
YET - nothing now. Why fire anything as a mage? It's horrible.<br />

<br />
I should however have mentioned that it was around PvP<br />
<br />
The fact that the majority (and we are talking above 70%) of all the healers in arena play Druid. All the other healers have cast spells but druid is the only class that has instant healing. They also has the best CC of the other healers and the best escape (can argue that monk Trancendance is better but it depends on the arena)<br />
<br />
This is HUGE and needs to be looked at, it's simply not balanced if we compare the other healers. Either buff all the other healers or nerf Druid.<br />
<br />
What worries me even more is that Disc Priest didn't get a buff. They may not be the least played healing class, but they sure are the worst (excluding Holy Priest).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Guardian of Elune (Guardian) now also reduces the rage cost of Savage Defense by the Druid's base dodge chance percentage.<br />
<br />
Good start to the Bear fixes. Pulverize was just way too good and basically mandatory on most fights. And even if you COULD use a different talent choice on a boss, if you were good enough to keep pulverise up 80% of the time then you still wanted Pulverize. Bristling fur looks good but I'm curious to see how well the rage reduction is on Guardian of Elune. Def need to test these two out.</div></div><hr />

many, if not all weak / bad talents have been discussed and reported countless times during beta. the developers on the other hand ignored those threads.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Druids are horrible to play against in PvP, tree form is impossible to hit through and a druid paired with good burst is very strong, and lets not talk about their escapes... <br />
Disc priest is just awful in arena, incredibly easy to train down as they have just about no saves. That is all from my own experience in arena and from what I've heard from others as well.<br />
<br />
I really hope to see some more changes coming soon, because it doesn't look too bright right now I feel.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually, it's only nerfs to talents that are not that great right now. Like the level 100 resto talents, or Renewal and Force of Nature(THE TREES,I mean seriously, when have you picked either of those outside of a 'laugh' and just to try it out, not because they're actually useful). This is perfectly in line with what they said about not nerfing talents that were too far ahead but buffing the ones behind. Most of the changes here fit that, save a few exceptions(mostly spec specific with a shared talent, like Mirror image for frost)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because they didn't know the final pricing a year ago, and if the final heirloom gold prices changed by so much as a single gold between then and the 6.1 release they would have been inundated with support ticket sdemanding a refund.<br />

<br />
My WOD first class to level: fire mage<br />
<br />
It was painful, xp was good as this expansion is easy mode for that but dmg was pathetic, so i thought, ok sego you are 100, everyone can see how bad fire mage dps is. reinforcements arrive!<br />
<br />
YET - nothing now. Why fire anything as a mage? It's horrible.<br />
<br />
VS<br />
<br />
My second character to level: BM Hunter. HAAHA this was fun HAHAHA easy everything. Was night and day, felt sorry for fire mage in Garrison. <br />
<br />
But I was scared, hunter too powerful, we be nerfed soon ...<br />
<br />
YET<br />
<br />
What did Blizz do?<br />
<br />
Ignore Fire mage pathetic dps. Let's lower the dps.<br />
Hunter with OP dps? BUFFED.<br />
<br />
HAHA wow.<br />
<br />
That is because fire needs gear, it always has.</div></div><hr />

You know you can collect them and not use them right? (No one forces you to do anything!).<br />
<br />
On that subject is the Daily Grind quest still the only way to get a signifcant amount of apexis?<br />
<br />
I would really like them to add another way of getting significant amount of Apexis, 600 from your frist 5 man 300 thereafter after sort of thing, add them to Ashran (well maybe not ashran as the gear rewards from Ashran are arguable already to good) but signficant amount from Invasions and world bosses etc<br />
<br />
Also is the new tier of Apexis gear dependant on having the other tiers and if so have they adjusted the price in anyway?<br />
<br />
Given how the scaling is does a 670 pair of legs now cost approx 60,000 apexis in total?<br />
<br />
That is 60 daily apexis quests, does anyone else think that is insane?<br />
<br />
I also have to point out while all these change seem good, and I am very happy with warlords, really loving raiding, really loving PvP again but where is the playable content in 6.1?</div></div><hr />

Still, there are no changes for ferals (buffing Force of Nature doesn't do anything since it's worse than Incarnation anyway).<br />
<br />
We need something to make ferals viable in BRF progress. Because other classes scale better than ferals do, we'll become mediocre in single target dps while staying utterly useless on AOE and switching to short-lived targets. We still don't have a valuable raid cooldown. Even our battleress is instant only if we waste our predatory swiftness proc on it. Currently it feels like there is no point in bringing a feral in for BRF progress if there just is another option present (unless you intentionally want to make it harder for yourselves).<br />
<br />
Buffing single target dps a bit and raising our AOE to an acceptable level would mean a lot already. Adjusting feral scaling could also be an option. By buffing swipe and making rip scale better, ferals could still be worth a raidspot in BRF, too. Simple, small buffs would already make a cat's life so much better.<br />
<br />
Kitties deserve some love too!<br />
<br />
PS. Making battleress instant, not consuming a predatory swiftness proc and castable in cat form would be a great QoL change.</div></div><hr />

But I am 100% with you, this patch brings.<br />
<br />
Follower Missions.<br />
<br />
Garrson Updates.<br />
<br />
Profession Updates.<br />
<br />
Class Changes.<br />

WHERE IS THE STUFF WE ARE ACTUALLY GOING TO PLAY?<br />
<br />
5 daily quests, that is it? and oh those daily quests are to do stuff ALREADY IN THE GAME!<br />
<br />
Oh but you can do the Apexis daily grind over and over and over again every day now!<br />
<br />
WOW I am so excited at the throught of that!<br />
<br />
No new 5 mans.<br />
<br />
No new quest hubs.<br />
<br />
No Tanaan Jungle.<br />
<br />
Nothing like Brawlers Guild or Proving Grounds.<br />
<br />
These patch notes are very very long for very very little content that we will actually play.<br />
<br />
Maybe....<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raincrow</div><div class="date">2015-01-24, 02:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm still puzzled over the Mistweaver Mana tea change. When the change was originally reported, it was &quot;4 times spirit instead of 4%&quot;, it has now dropped to 3 time spirit AND they have changed Ascension to provide 10% spirit instead of 20% mana? My Mistweaver doesn't even sport 1000 spirit at this point, trinkets that should be giving me 170+ spirit are providing less than 100, with no indication that this is going to be fixed. Counting Ascension, I have to get up to 2328 spirit in order for the new Mana Tea to match my current mana tea.<br />
<br />
As a Mistweaver, I really only have 2 styles of healing: Really mana efficient raid blanketing with chi use, and incredible inefficient rapid mana burn. It seems all this change does is literally eliminate a healing option for Mistweavers while not doing anything to the default Uplift/ReM play style we use already. But removing the option to be jump roles for a few moments to &quot;Oh crud&quot; heal a tank because we'd kill our mana too quickly leaves me a little confused. As does figuring out how I'm going to get 2300 spirit without gimping the rest of my healing.</div></div><hr />

and why do they remove use items from ashran, this is stupid, they supposed to put difference in pvp like they want, by creating ashran, fucking whiners want balanced pvp go play bg or arena<br />
<br />
War Ravaged (615) it's worthless at this point and Blackrock is starting to look the same (not that you get it often from salvage). I've gotten goredrenched from the Salvage Yard maybe 2-3 times total, big loss? This is a net buff really.<br />
<br />
The Ashran items they removed were: mana regeneration+mana drain from the enemy, mass dispel, mass invis, wand of death (only good for patrol) and the thing I actually kinda mind: town portal. This will make the fragment portal more important though and mass invis is replaced by the invis pot. Most of them were just bloat.</div></div><hr />

um.. because they weren´t obtainable with gold, they were obtainable with JP, which no longer exists. The ones that were obtainable with gold ( guild ones) are still obtainable with gold on live. The ones that were available with DM tickets are still in game. The change is going from a JP vendor to a gold vendor.<br />

I think they are thinking about mains. Right now for most players, those 615 and 630 tokens are worthless, and very quickly the 645 ones will be too. But even for alts, it is not a horrible change to get the +3,6,9 tokens instead of the 615 ones.<br />

<br />
I just am not seeing it as a nerf to salvage yard. I guess it depends on how they do it though. If this simply means that we are getting more +3,6,9 tokens INSTEAD of the 615 and 630 tokens, then in my opinion, this is a buff since most of the 615 tokens I can´t use. If we are still going to get the same number of 3,6,9 tokens, then yeah it is a nerf. My hunch this is in response to a lot of people posting that the 615 tokens are a waste, there was even some suggestions that we be able to exchange the 615s for +3s</div></div><hr />

Not much of a buff, really. It's just going to make our 90 talents actually worth using on single target. Right now they're mostly ignored, and only Barrage is brought for AoE/Cleave. The 40 second Stampede is a slight buff for PvE and could have an impact in arena though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Agreed.<br />
<br />
The game is defiantly the best out on the market, but the market is really dry. They removed too many individual roles only specific classes could fill and kind of made everything one generic play what you want whenever you want. I had fun for the first 2 months or so, and it was defiantly worth the money, but the WoW I know seems to be gone forever... and I guess that's what the majority wanted, which is fair.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Better be removed. Would you like to start buying your mythic gear also from the store? <br />
<br />
Nevermind, I already know you would like that also.<br />

Dont you worry thats going to be in patch 6.2</div></div><hr />

What are you talking about? Paying sub with gold is the same as buying mythic gear with real money?</div></div><hr />

The argument goes something like....<br />
<br />
Buy item for a months sub with real money.<br />
<br />
Sell item for 25k gold in game.<br />
<br />
Sell 10 of those items then buy a mythic run from a top guild.<br />
<br />
Therefore selling sub item for real money = Pay 2 Win.<br />
<br />
The argument against is by the time guilds are selling runs there is nothign left to win.<br />
<br />
(I am not saying I agree or disagre btw just saying what the argument is).</div></div><hr />

I would say something on why should stay but well if ya no longer enjoying the game then you need to find something that you will enjoy..<br />

The problem is I don't think there is much in the way of good MMO's now as they have all tried copying each other in some form, and well we all know how they went.. SWToR supposed to be the bees knees went fp2 really quick, ESO so new not funny went f2p, wont be surprised to see Wildstar go there next.. There are just too many MMO's around now that to find a decent one will be hard for those who have fallen out with WoW..</div></div><hr />

Actually I would like to buy my subscription with gold. So just the other way around. :)<br />

If someone really believes that, they are pretty shortsighted. According to this (granted, now pretty old article) http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/gold-trading-exposed-introduction-article?page=3 around 30% of players were already involved in gold-buying/selling (despite it being illegal). With gold being pretty worthless the last few expansions, a lot of guilds also preferred rl-money over ig-gold as payment for boosting-services. (There is also a pretty high number of &quot;guild-intern&quot; gold-selling-activities, where people ask in their guilds for gold and offer money (or the other way around) - denying that a demand for goldselling exists is just out of touch with reality.)<br />
A plex-like item in wow would enable the casual player in need of gold to get that pretty save, which will make it even harder for illegal services to sell their products and therefore reduce spamming/botting in a meaningful way. Additionally this gold only enables you to buy stuff that other people offer (besides mount-skins), so you can't really pay-to-win, just pay-to-buy-what-other-people-already-offer-and-therefore-might-get-on-the-same-level-as-they-are-until-the-next-item-reset. ;)</div></div><hr />

Re: Power Shot, Glaive Toss &amp; Barrage; These are buffs to one tier of talents, all of which gave nothing for ST dps. Now they might have some part to play in a Hunter's rotation ST but this is a very minor buff in truth.<br />
Re: Stampede; in PvE at least (cannot speak for PvP personally) this is not relevant as it will still be behind A Murder of Crows in most fights.<br />
<br />
My main question would be &quot;Where's the buff to Exotic Munitions?&quot;. I understand that the freezing arrow slow is great in PvP but the other 2 ammo choices amount to almost a 10% dps loss in PvE.</div></div><hr />
