However, it's also a ... reindeer? With a needle on the front to plow through your ceiling if you have no chimney? I don't even know what to call it, but it is not appealing or interesting. The first mount I would not buy, probably not even if it were on sale. I find it not to be noble, pretty, or anything. It's just a beast.</div></div><hr />

I think of it more like buying a car, and then paying extra for a feature or getting a paint job.

You don't pay your dealer a monthly fee to provide your car with upgrades either so it's a very poor analogy, you already payed extra for the &quot;paint job&quot; through the expansion purchase.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't think you quite understand what you're paying for your when you get a subscription. You're right, you don't pay your dealer a monthly fee to upgrade your car, you're paying for the basic utility of what a car was made for - driving. A subscription fee gives you the basic service of logging into the servers - that's it. Anything else is purely extra.<br />
<br />
You do not have to buy the expansions, you could just play in the vanilla and BC areas forever, and in fact the skills and talent trees, (and now all of the races as of MoP) are updated for you at no cost. But if you want to see the new content, you pay extra for that luxury. You want to level a monk, you buy MoP, and you pay extra. You want a fancy mount, you pay extra. None of that stuff is required in order to log in and play, which is all your monthly fee provides, but if you want to improve your experience, it's going to cost you. Just like power windows, a massive sound system, and heated seats are not needed to drive your car, but if you're desperate or rich enough for a more comfy ride, you pay for it. Maybe you don't see the utility in such frivolous additions - and that's fine -, but for some people it's worth the little bit you pay considering how long you'll be using it.</div></div><hr />

You lost me here, this used to be the case 7-8 years ago, these days the actual cost for running a MMO is a barely a footnote in their financial reports, usually bunched up with other minor costs.<br />

You pay a subscription to have the developers continue to develop content and maintain the game world, we used to get fancy mounts in game before Blizzard store was even thought of, in fact we didn't pay anything extra to improve our experience, we got the full experience and all content associated with the game for the subscription alone.<br />

At the end of the day the only reason you pay extra is because people are willing to pay extra for something they previously got included in the original price, which is why the mind boggles at the behavior.</div></div><hr />

<br />
At the end of the day the only reason you pay extra is because people are willing to pay extra for something they previously got included in the original price, which is why the mind boggles at the behavior.<br />
<br />
Well let's go through all of these things, shall we?<br />
<br />
First, MMO's remain the most costly ventures to develop and maintain in the gaming world. This hasn't changed from &quot;7-8 years ago&quot;. Rest assured it is much more than a blip in their financial radar, so any way they can fatten up their bottom line would be welcome. Granted this would be true even if WoW were cheap, but it's not. At all.<br />
<br />
Yes, we absolutley pay a subscription fee for them to continue to develop and maintain content...which they are doing (and currently at a much faster pace than previously). In addition to that they are also--once in a while--putting something extra and optional like this up for a separate fee. There are still a lot of &quot;fancy&quot; mounts developed and put in the game for you to earn in-game (the wind serpent mounts being prime examples along with their fancier lightning-encased brethren). This mount does not detract from the desirability of those others. They are still beautiful. Many are still relatively rare.<br />
<br />
Also, these purely cosmetic premium additions don't do anything to &quot;improve your experience&quot; that the same types of items in the game don't. In fact, if you look at a great deal of the comments for most of the mounts they've sold separately, people generally seem to find them rather goofy or ugly.<br />
<br />
As far as why people are willing to pay extra for them, it's exactly that. They are extra. Optional. Not necessary, and not an &quot;instead of&quot; for content they might have made for the game. Why, when this is blatantly the case, people get so uptight over these things--each and every time, without fail--is, however, truly bewildering.</div></div><hr />

Why do you need a source? You writing a news piece about it or something?<br />

It's pretty evident there will be a major slide. Just sample the forums.

<br />
It's pretty evident there will be a major slide. Just sample the forums. The forum community likely represents 1% of the entire player base, but if THESE people (the addicts who have to constantly be on forums discussing the game when they can't be playing it) are unhappy, then imagine what the 99% are thinking.<br />
<br />
The next quarterly report will reveal one of the biggest slides WoW has seen yet. That will upset those who have no life outside of the game, but perhaps 'outside' is somewhere they should try visiting.<br />
<br />
Im not sure if the sub numbers will be much lower cause China just got MOP. But EU and US will be in bad state. 1st Quarter of 2013 will be even worse if they dont get 5.2 out before that. But we know that they will push it out even if its half finished. Thats the new BLizzard. We saw it happen with D3 and money matters more than players at this stage for them.</div></div><hr />

This hasn't changed from &quot;7-8 years ago&quot;. Rest assured it is much more than a blip in their financial radar, so any way they can fatten up their bottom line would be welcome. Granted this would be true even if WoW were cheap, but it's not. At all.<br />
<br />
The whole of Activision/Blizzards's development costs where less than half of what WoW generates, just to give you an idea how little WoW actually costs to develop.<br />
<br />
<br />
Yes, we absolutley pay a subscription fee for them to continue to develop and maintain content...which they are doing (and currently at a much faster pace than previously). In addition to that they are also--once in a while--putting something extra and optional like this up for a separate fee. There are still a lot of &quot;fancy&quot; mounts developed and put in the game for you to earn in-game (the wind serpent mounts being prime examples along with their fancier lightning-encased brethren). This mount does not detract from the desirability of those others. They are still beautiful. Many are still relatively rare.<br />
<br />
Yet the developers you pay spend time developing an item you have to pay extra for, something we didn't do in the past, nor should have to...<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, these purely cosmetic premium additions don't do anything to &quot;improve your experience&quot; that the same types of items in the game don't. In fact, if you look at a great deal of the comments for most of the mounts they've sold separately, people generally seem to find them rather goofy or ugly.<br />
<br />
Wasn't me that claimed it improved the experience, it was in a reply to such a claim.<br />
<br />
<br />
As far as why people are willing to pay extra for them, it's exactly that. They are extra. Optional. Not necessary, and not an &quot;instead of&quot; for content they might have made for the game. Why, when this is blatantly the case, people get so uptight over these things--each and every time, without fail--is, however, truly bewildering.<br />
<br />
The developer you payed for to work on the game is taking time off to work on something you pay extra for, how is that not an issue? And as Blizzard claimed on multiple occasions that the main issue with slow content delivery is just lack of hire-able developers and especially artists it actually takes away resources from the main development.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard is a business - they want to make money. If you don't like what they're selling then don't buy it. Why do people complain about such dumbass things? Most global businesses have additional things you can purchase alongside a main subscription.<br />
<br />
The bold bit made me cringe. You're not paying a developer to do anything you clueless imbecile. You are paying Blizzard for a videogame - how they distribute their personnel is entirely their decision. If you feel as though what they are doing is detrimental to the end product to the point where you don't want it any more then stop your subscription and take your tears elsewhere.<br />
<br />
To be honest, anyone that gets their knickers in a twist over this trivial issue should probably leave their parents basement and get a clue in life.<br />

You're pretty much just asking why we should have to pay for anything, and why can't they just build it into the game for free, and thinking anyone who pays more than they should is being foolish.<br />
<br />
The bottom-line for both sides is simply: because they can. On Blizzard's side, the money they make from these is like the subscription, it goes towards updates and maintenance, or else they would not be the massive company with a rep for good games the way that they are. If Blizzard can continue to make profit from something to improve their games and get themselves more money, they can and will do so, and it would be stupid of them not to. They'll probably make half a million bucks on this, if not more. That's why Blizzard does not make them free for everyone to get. You can call them selfish, but that's the nature of all MMO companies is to make revenue wherever they can on any service they think people will pay for - that's how F2P MMOs with in-game stores, like Guild Wars 2, where you trade money for items or currency keep going. The more money you can make wherever you can make it, the more successful you and your game will be. You could argue that every pay service should be free, but if WoW didn't have extra mounts, and all of their expansions and services were free, we would definitely not be playing the same game right now.<br />
<br />
As for the people who buy the mount, no, they don't need them, they already have plenty. But if they love the way it looks and it improves how they feel while playing the game they love, then it is a worthwhile investment for them, and they are willing to give their money to a good company in exchange for a good product. For a one-time payment of $25, they can enjoy a beautiful mount on every character for the next, I don't know, 3-7 years, however long WoW lasts. The subscription fee is not really a part of this (unless you're tight enough on money where you just can't afford to even think about paying for this on top of the other), because clearly Blizzard doesn't need more of your money, but you're giving more cash to a company you trust to make a better product in the long run, and you get an odd looking mount for it. It's win-win. Now for the people in this thread like myself who think it's a hideous looking beast, we would lose $25 which is a lot worse than the ugly mount we'd be getting for it, and Blizzard doesn't gain or lose anything, which is why it's just a purely optional mount on the store - neither side loses out by not buying it.</div></div><hr />

WoW is dying. Blizzard are padding their pockets with this extra mount. (Extra point for showing your sarcasm by replacing the z's with $) No one will buy it. Everyone will buy it. I won't be special because everyone will buy it. It's too expensive. It's too cheap, only scrubs will get it. Blizzard gets enough money with subscription fees, they should give us free mounts every month. Be glad for what you get. They shouldn't create new content but fix the old one. It's ugly. It's nice.

This is simply rubbish imo. You have no proof that all the proceeds from this and other digital purchase options from the blizzard store actually go towards developing more content, or upgrading servers, rather than into the pockets of the shareholders or ceo.<br />

It's one tiny model. Basically a reskinned / pimped Talbuk. It's not like it takes months of manpower to create something like this.<br />

You say that like it's a bad thing, and no, I don't doubt that the money goes toward other things like Starcraft II, Titan, and Diablo III. You're right, I don't have proof of where the money is going, but since Blizzard continues to be a good company and provides quality products so that the money is likely staying within the company, and there's not stories in the news of massive scandals where all the devs are fleeing the country, then it's perfectly fine, and players like me will occasionally continue to throw money at them for mounts and pets that we enjoy knowing that we're getting something awesome for it and that Blizzard will keep up its standards.</div></div><hr />

Good company? You do realise that BLizzard has a story of actually listening to their players and designing games for the players. So why on earth did D3 not have at least optional servers that had no RMAH and you couldn't trade items other than in the group you ran with? Cause most players wanted that over forced RMAH.<br />
<br />
So BLizzard has changed. Its no longer designing games for their gamers. WOW has been turned into a themepark game that has very little to do with solid and good RPG systems. The talent trees have been turned into a joke and the 90 lvls of leveling feels empty compared to the early characters where you got new stuff every level.</div></div><hr />

<br />
At this point I'm assuming you don't even know how a business is run. So far your argument for everything is that Blizzard should give everything away for free and that money just falls from the sky for everyone. I already answered your question on why they charge us extra, and your response is that it's &quot;a load of crap&quot; just because you think they're an evil corporation, so this is not even a discussion anymore. I'd love to know where then do you think this money is going, overseas? Of course Blizzard is pocketing some of that money, that's how they keep their employees happy in a garbage economy and give their long-time employees amazing gifts for X-years of service, and in turn we get a better game. You talk about them not being able to find the right staff - considering the team of SWTOR and FFXIV got fired shortly after launch because their game was generally thought of as a failure, it's a lot better to be looking for the right people rather than letting go of them all (granted I think Blizz had one set of layoffs last year, but I don't even remember the department). <br />
<br />
And while the game still might be going and they still profit from all the monthly subscriptions, they would not be making buckets of profit and operate the same. You've clearly never played most of the other MMOs that are out there that are down to a handful of low population servers with horrible content and a lack of timely or interesting updates. Warcraft is and continues to be successful for a reason, as does Blizzard and all the other games they make. They don't announce release dates because they can take their time to make a quality product, unlike a majority of other games that have gone F2P purely to survive.</div></div><hr />

To be fair, it takes &quot;being on a server that's getting empty&quot;, and &quot;being in a situation where you notice that&quot;.<br />
<br />
I primarily play on two servers (one for alliance and one for horde). My alliance one remains packed as far as my experience -- the shrine is busy and the auction house has tons of stuff on it.<br />
<br />
My horde one is a ghost town, but, I don't notice that when I'm leveling alts, because of dungeon finder and now CRZ. Both create the illusion that the server is busier than it truly is. I have to go to a major non-shared hub or look at the auction house to see how empty it has really gotten.<br />
<br />
I personally do not spend much time in non-shared hubs or play the auction house much, so a lot of the time the difference between my two servers isn't very obvious. When I do eventually go to the ghost-town auction house, it's always a shock.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Because they can&quot; doesn't make it right.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'd love to know where then do you think this money is going, overseas?<br />
<br />
Shareholders and execs.<br />
<br />
<br />
and in turn we get a better game.<br />
<br />
You don't, I stated their development costs twice already.<br />
<br />
<br />
You talk about them not being able to find the right staff<br />
<br />
No I don't, it's Blizzard them selfs that uses that excuse for slow development times.<br />
<br />
<br />
And while the game still might be going and they still profit from all the monthly subscriptions, they would not be making buckets of profit and operate the same.<br />
<br />
Again I point to my previous statements about their development costs, after taking half of the revenue from WoW alone to develop all Activision/Blizzard titles and projects they &quot;only&quot; have around $600 million left.<br />
<br />
<br />
You've clearly never played most of the other MMOs that are out there that are down to a handful of low population servers with horrible content and a lack of timely or interesting updates.<br />
<br />
My signature clearly indicates that I never played any other MMO out there...as far as WoW's success compared to other games I'd pose it has to do with a wide varieties of other reasons than the game being the superior, that's another discussion though.</div></div><hr />

i currently have 141 mounts and haven't bought any blizzard store mounts.<br />
it's almost like you don't buy them you don't get your 150 mount achievement<br />
<br />
That is kind of silly to say, I currently own 188 mounts. If I removed all the promotional and Store mounts I'd still have 177. Which is well over the limit for that achievement. As long as you actually put effort into getting those mounts and not slacking or being lazy you can get the achievement. So the only disadvantage is how hard you are willing to work to get the achievement and NOT blame the store or promotion mounts. u.u</div></div><hr />

you said would i be alright with them charging for raid finder or for more levels or for new professions which you have to buy expansions for. <br />
<br />
the majority of what you said only comes when a new expansion comes out. <br />
<br />
or are you trying to say if blizzard sold pay to win items? thats entirely different from things like mounts and pets since both are vanity items blizzard doesnt sell any non vanity items individually they sell them in expansions. <br />
<br />
tbh they should start selling white transmog sets on the blizzard store too that would make alot of money<br />

<br />
If you're asking how people can stand to pay $25 on top of the $15 they pay every month, it's the same as paying extra for premium channels on cable that you certainly don't need, but if you have the extra money and the desire, why the heck not? Yes, they could have just put it in the game and made it available to everyone (which is what I meant by free, so I apologize for that confusion) and no one ever forgets that, but the fact that I can have a cute cat made of fire rolling around and making adorable noises at me for a mere $10 is the only thing that matters. Does it mean they're ripping me off because I could've got it for free if they weren't stingy and just put it in the game instead of putting it on the store? Yeah, sure. Do we care? Nah. Do some people? Definitely, there's a lot of people like you who refuse because it seems rude or extreme to pay above and beyond, or some that are living paycheck to paycheck who can't afford to. And I do think it's a shame that not everyone can get them without paying extra, and I'm sure we could talk about boycotting it and making a difference in how things are run, but the bottom line is that people will still buy it if they like it enough.<br />
<br />
If you're asking how Blizzard has the tenacity to charge people extra on top of the monthly service, it's to make more money. You're right, it doesn't matter where it goes, so I shouldn't have brought it up. It's just blatently to get more cash out of their subscribers. I know that, people who refuse to buy it know it, everyone who buys it knows it. Whether you think that's evil or not because they're using it to fund Titan, or perhaps build a new pool at the 3rd beachhouse of the CEO, doesn't matter really, not our concern if we're happy riding a pretty pony. They can make money from people who want a shiny mount or pet, and they will do so.</div></div><hr />

Edit: Looked it over some more and it looks incredibly detailed, it just doesn't seem special.<br />

For example, the Celestial Steed is completely unique. The Heart of the Aspects also looks like no other mount.<br />

This one just looks too much like a Talbuk. If I spend $25 on a mount, I'd want it to stick out - not just get lost in the crowd.</div></div><hr />

How does he go from jumping to flying in the video?! Unless the demo person had no flying at level 90, then went and bought flying just for the vid? Or is there two versions of the mount, one ground, one flying?<br />

<br />
&quot;Technically&quot; it was a merger. Bobby Kotick, CEO of Activision, is CEO of the merged entity. Which means Activision controls Blizzard. regardless of who bought who.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Mounts are acceptable to pay extra for because they don't give an advantage to players that decide to buy 'em. You can't replace it with ''anything and everything'' because that would include things that give an advantage, causing the game to become Pay2Win.<br />
<br />
<br />
It's easier to achieve it if you buy the mounts though so I'd say it can be an advantage.<br />
<br />
There's enough mounts in this game to get the 150 mounts achievement, without having to rely on luck.</div></div><hr />

Send a gold bullion their way.<br />
<br />
On a more on topic note though, I still cannot get over the amount of people who see this as an acceptable practice. This is a subscription MMO with a cash shop. A subscription game with a mount that costs more than a months worth of playtime. <br />
<br />
The usual expected &quot;well then don't buy it!&quot; or &quot;it is their game, they need to make money somehow!&quot; and variants of such aside, I think a million (billion?) dollar company is just being greedy to a fault when a cash shop is in play with a subscription MMO, especially when you consider how much money is invested each day, let alone each month, in overpriced character transfers/remodels/etc.<br />

<br />
It doesnt have a specified number but feel and impression that company makes towards its customers. When we have some jaring problems in game itself varying from PvP to PvE and all we hear about them are excuses such as &quot;limited resources (lol)&quot; or &quot;technical limitations&quot;, it gets rather irky when we see the very same company somehow finding enough resources to make a mount that doesnt bring anything to game itself.</div></div><hr />

I think I post this most times a new mount comes out. Are you seriously complaining about a business making a profit from something that is incredibly successful? Do you complain when you pay too much for drinks on a night out, for cigarettes, for dinner at a restaurant?</div></div><hr />

Your subscription does not warrant free stuff. You get content and the right to log in for your 12 euros or w/e it is. This is just extra on top of it. But you gotta pay for it.<br />
It isn't game breaking if you don't buy it.<br />
<br />
There's no difference between a f2p mmo who sells something cosmetic vs. a pay to play mmo who sells something cosmetic.<br />
<br />
Ah well. Each new mount and pet added to the store spurrs the same replies as always.<br />

Just goes to show you how many people don't know shit about fiction unless it's shoveled down their throats in high fantasy tv/video games. Hell I can't even say that, they were even in DnD. <br />
<br />
Personally I wish the nose/ears weren't that weird skin color too but otherwise it's a faithful rendition of a Kirin and a really cool mount for mythology buffs. I'm just glad to see they acknowledged actual Kirins in the game after giving the name of Qilins (another spelling of Kirins) to FOO DOGS. <br />
<br />
I do think it would have been more successful if they &quot;westernized&quot; it a bit more in the face rather than following the traditional pictures so faithfully, as most modern depictions merge it with the western unicorn a bit more. The red cow-like snout and copious facial hair almost makes it look like a baboon. They could've also went with a more appealing color scheme and some glow effects. Kirins were described in mythology as practically shitting magic, if there was one time a mount called for sparkles it's this one.</div></div><hr />
