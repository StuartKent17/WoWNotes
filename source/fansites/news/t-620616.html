<br />
He's not too hard. Get a tank, he hits for nothing regularly.<br />
<br />
Go into karazhan, clear attunemens trash. Kill him if you want, don't if you dont. Run up the stairs where the repair guy is and clear that upper ring. There is a blood soaked door on the right up the stairs. Opening it will get you in combat with the boss, so be ready. Just have a tank tank him, and drag him around the circle whenever his Spirits build up to much, as they explode for 6k damage. Every so often he does a &quot;Blood Mirror&quot; thing and shoots a red beam out, which transfers all damage that he takes to that person, SO DONT HIT HIM WHEN HES DOING IT. Hunters can FD, You can vanish, bubble, etc to get it off.<br />
<br />
He's not terribly difficult, and if you don't kill your own people or explode he's probably 5 mannable, I did it with 7 and it was cake once we stopped killing eachother and exploding.<br />
<br />
If you have questions i'll try to answer them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
He has 400k hp, so it's easily doable. (we just did it with 4 people, hunter dps, retri dps, warr tank with crap gear and 4 parts t6 priest healer).<br />
<br />
He spawns some red globules, which you need to get AWAY FROM. These hurt. <br />
What we did was kite him around the room you get up to when you go up from attumen's room. <br />
<br />
He does some red beam against one of the raid members, and when he does that you MUST NOT DPS THE BOSS. The person that has been targetted with the beam gets 1/4 of the damage done to the boss, so it could easily kill a person if you have bad healers. <br />
We just stopped dps totally when he did the beams, and nuked him down in between the beams. <br />
<br />
Enjoy your cool axe and your non-combat pet! (Note, he also drops 2 extra badges :))</div></div><hr />

Come on. I did him with me (an enhancement shaman) and a retri pala as a healer... AND a retri pala as a tank... with 5 people total.<br />
<br />
He is kinda tricky if you do him as a 5-man boss, no doubt about him. But I'd say that with 10 people, he's a pushover. Run away from the bombs and heal the dude with Blood Mirror. Once we figured the Blood Mirror debuff out (aka. we read the tooltip), he went down.</div></div><hr />

yeah i have the same thing. basically if you toss it to somebody they will have it follow them. only problem you might not get it back. so i found a way to get the shade to yourself. put the necklace (haunted memento) in the bank and then take it out again. works like a charm.

Fake because you get 10 points for lvl 10, 20 for lvl 20 and so on that would give him a total of 210 at lvl 60 atleast not to mention learning your mount, pet etc.</div></div><hr />

I agree as well, appears to be a total fake. Look at the 100 in the Zombie &quot;Covert 100 players...&quot; that is pretty offset from the rest.</div></div><hr />

No, it isn't.<br />

its still 2 minutes. But if you kill more than one roach, each one killed will lower your debuff timer by 10 seconds. Likewise, zombies hitting you will knock it down 10 seconds.<br />
