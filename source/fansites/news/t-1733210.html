Shadowmeld Bug<br />
Shadowmeld's (Night Elf racial) functionality received a bug fix in Patch 6.1 to address a number of issues with the ability that wound up affecting its behavior in PvP combat. A hotfix is being worked on (it's not ready yet) that will restore Shadowmeld back to the way it worked (while keeping the bug fixes intact). (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/364344-shadowmeld-still-not-fixed/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/16528042667?page=1#14))<br />
<br />
Shadowmeld Bug<br />
Don't you usually put bug fixes in the patch notes? You know, under the big Bug Fixes section, why wasn't Shadowmeld mentioned? Legitimately interested.<br />
In that particular instance, the change was to make Shadowmeld work more consistently like Vanish or Invisibility where a number of bugs got fixed with those abilities. It was not anything that would be noticed or warrant a patch note because it was intended to not affect how the ability worked. <br />
<br />
Update: The hotfix to return Shadowmeld back to it's pre-6.1 functionality after tomorrow's rolling restarts should be going in later tonight. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/364344-shadowmeld-still-not-fixed/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/16528042667?page=2#22))<br />
<br />
Patch 6.1 Undocumented Changes<br />
Offloading some of the information I've been tracking down in no particular order.<br />
<br />
Regarding Paladin's Hammer of Wrath concerns, I've verified that it was only a tooltip update in Patch 6.1 and there were no further changes to the ability. Also, the ability does not and should not be benefiting from Sword of Light as it's not a melee attack.<br />
<br />
I noticed that Find Weakness for sub rogues has been nerfed in pvp for 6.1. Before the patch It was at 100% armor bypass now its at 50%, this change has only affected pvp. This was not posted in the patch notes.<br />
Tooltip for the ability Find Weakness stated that it &quot;Bypasses less armor on players.&quot;. Additionally, the ability itself no longer exists as of Patch 6.0.2 back on October 15, 2014.<br />
<br />
Rogue - http://us.battle.net/wow/en/blog/15682579#rogue<br />
Find Weakness’ effects have been merged into baseline Ambush, Garrote, and Cheap Shot for Subtlety Rogues.<br />
I Understand we want blizzard to be more open about stuff. But lets be honest it might sometimes be hard or insane to document every single little tweak ever. So trying to nitpick every little bit of something even with something that doesnt really affect gameplay in anyway other than aesthetics. lets not try to be too nit picky and just help blizzard understand where were coming from.<br />
Thanks, I've been trying to investigate credible claims. A number of purported inaccuracies were actually noted in the patch notes or hotfix blog.<br />
<br />
Re: Shadowmeld, Cretch appears to be referring to this: http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/16528042667<br />
<br />
Looks like it doesn't drop combat in 6.1. Is that just PVP Cretch or everywhere?<br />
The Shadowmeld's (Night Elf racial) functionality received a bug fix to address a number of issues with the ability that wound up affecting its behavior in PvP combat. We're working on a hotfix that's undergoing testing but not ready to be implemented yet that will restore Shadowmeld back to the way it worked (while keeping the bug fixes intact).<br />

Gladiator's sanctum work orders got stealth nerfed to be 20 bones per order instead of 10 when WoD launched<br />
<br />
Show me your patch notes on that<br />
Got clarification on that one, thanks for bringing it to my attention. The change has been updated in the 6.1 Patch Notes.<br />
<br />
Gladiator's Sanctum<br />
Work Orders for Gladiator's Sanctum shipments now cost 20 Broken Bones (up from 10). Additionally, shipments now award less gold but increased the chance of receiving an item or bonus Honor Points.

Character / Items<br />
I can not Favorite my PVP Mount (ex: Vicious War Stead)? Bug or intended and why please. #Warcraft<br />
Those mounts are character specific and the favorite feature is account wide. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/572475301357215744))<br />

PvP<br />
Any plans to fix the 2-6 sec delay on Execution Sentence in PvP? really kills the talent. (Holy, used as a heal)<br />
We don't see this internally. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/572471416307654657))<br />
<br />
Seems like the DRs for CC are now always 15 seconds rather than 15-20, feels like a huge buff for comps like RMD. intended change?<br />
It is intended that it always resets after a fixed amount of time, but it should be 18 seconds; we'll get this fixed. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/572475810625421312))<br />
15 sec DR been the case since WoD release. Keep that in mind,to understand what classes you're about to nerf<br />
No, it was fixed to be more exact in 6.1 (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/572481692444672000))<br />
20sec cd, 4sec duration, must have been 16sec DR the highest at all times.<br />
It was somewhere between 15 and 15.4 seconds. It will now be 18 and 18.4 seconds. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/572482319849660416))<br />
<br />
how are you guys feeling about RBG mmr? #1 player hasn't changed in months due to deflation. HotH/HotA 2102 rating<br />
More players per team and longer matches results in less games played, and lower ratings compared to other brackets. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/572472974734856192))<br />
I guess even less player will play RBG now due to the recent mmr changes. who wants to spend years for 2k<br />
Nothing changed with mmr (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/572510354091032576))<br />

Another Overwatch interview (http://www.overpwn.com/news/32-pax-east-playerscut-yes-no-interview-overwatch) provided some new information today. An interesting official response to the question of having a Field of View setting also came up again (http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/2yi4yx/blizzards_stance_on_fov_in_their_upcoming_fps/):<br />
<br />
<br />
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2015/march/paxOVInterview.png (www.overpwn.com/news/32-pax-east-playerscut-yes-no-interview-overwatch) <br />
<br />
FOV is definitely an important element of many shooters, including Overwatch. For clarity, Overwatch currently has a fixed vertical FOV of 60. This means that at 16:9 (which most players use), you'll have a horizontal FOV of about 92.<br />
<br />
To answer the &quot;will there/won't there&quot; question directly, though, there are no plans at this time to implement an FOV slider to the game. The rationale here is that we want to avoid creating a situation of &quot;Haves and Have-Nots,&quot; where those who are aware of the slider are able to gain an advantage over those who aren't. Instead, we'd rather develop towards a unified FOV that feels good across the board. Aiming preferences, viewmodels, dizziness, nausea—these are all factors we considered when designing the current FOV and will remain sensitive and very open to as testing continues.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps!<br />

<br />
For Blizzard's case you have got answer there:<br />
&quot;we want to avoid creating a situation of &quot;Haves and Have-Nots,&quot; where those who are aware of the slider are able to gain an advantage over those who aren't.&quot;<br />
<br />
They are basically afraid that if their game will get even slightly complicated, they won't be able to cater to the dumbest playerbase. They are going straight for the commercial success where more players = more money, so making sure even monkey can play their game is a viable strategy.<br />
<br />
However commercial success != quality game, but who cares when people will buy it anyway since it's &quot;OMG BLIZZARD'S NEW GAME!!!!1&quot; and it will be so plain and simple that even your dog could play it.</div></div><hr />

The weapon models are also huge taking up valuable screen space, can't imagine what they are thinking not allowing an FOV slider. <br />
:confused:<br />
<br />
We will find a way around that.:cool:<br />

What dipshit doesn't look at the option menu in an FPS on PC?</div></div><hr />

<br />
but elves can still hide anywhere they want. whatever guys. whatever.<br />
I thought that Forsaken were no longer classified as undead because paladin abilities against them were too strong in PvP...? I could be wrong, I was never much into PvP and my memory of the game becomes fuzzier the further I go back.<br />

yea but they cant use the same name.. it was rejected there was a post about itI'm pretty sure I recall a blue post that the company allowed them to continue using the name since the products were completely different. Could try and dig it up but no promises.<br />
<br />
Blizzard Entertainment can indeed still use the name. The issue was that Blizzard wanted a registered trademark for the name, which grants enhanced copyright protections or methods for redress of infringement than just a trademark. However, the name &quot;Overwatch&quot; already had a pending application by a different business in the same category (computer and electronics, to summarize). Blizzard's application was suspended because of the probability of confusion between the two products.<br />
<br />
Blizzard still has the ability to trademark (™) their intellectual property, they just can't stick the ® in front of it, at least for now. Naturally for a corporation the size of Blizzard Entertainment with valuable intellectual properties, a registered trademark is much preferred (see Considerations paragraph) (http://info.legalzoom.com/registered-vs-unregistered-trademark-21089.html).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, it is almost unfathomable that all women aren't exactly identical, all part of a nameless mass with no individual differences, right? Kind of breaks all our illusions, almost as if they were as diverse and multifaceted as us men - unthinkable, right! Before you know it they will even start cdemanding to be treated as individuals, who may not all have the same interests, opinions and perspective...</div></div><hr />
