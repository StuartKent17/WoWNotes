Blizzard added the Realm First! feats of strength to the game in the latest Cataclysm beta build. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Realm First! Nefarian (http://db.mmo-champion.com/a/5409/) - First guild on the realm to defeat Nefarian in Blackwing Descent on Heroic difficulty while in a guild group.<br />
Realm First! Al'Akir (http://db.mmo-champion.com/a/5410/) - First guild on the realm to defeat Al'Akir in the Throne of the Four Winds on Heroic difficulty while in a guild group.<br />
Realm First! Sinestra (http://db.mmo-champion.com/a/5411/) - First guild on the realm to defeat Sinestra in the Bastion of Twilight on Heroic difficulty while in a guild group.<br />
<br />
<br />
Today, Mumper answered revealed something very interesting on the official forums: the Realm First! achievements can be obtained in both 10 and 25-Man raids. So far, these achievements do not have any specific reward.<br />
<br />
They are available to both 10 and 25 player raids, whoever does it first.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Vial of the Sands - Alchemy Mount?<br />
A new spell appeared in the latest beta build, the Vial of the Sands (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/93328/vial-of-the-sands/). According to the spell and reagents it looks like it will be an alchemy recipe available through Discoveries, the Vial of the Sands (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/65891/vial-of-the-sands/) isn't a regular mount and will let you transform into a Sandstone Drake and carry an ally on your back!<br />
<br />
<br />
Vial of the Sands (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/65891/vial-of-the-sands/) - Teaches you how to transform into a dragon, allowing you to fly very fast and carry an ally on your back.<br />

Pre-Cataclysm World Event on PTRs<br />
Greetings,<br />
<br />
The early stages of the pre-Cataclysm events have begun on the PTR's.<br />
<br />
If you're encountering any problems with the events themselves or have any feedback please post them in this thread.<br />
<br />
Enjoy! <br />
<br />
The 3rd part of the event is now available on PTRs, Doomsayers are in capital cities and a new questline is available to infiltrate the Twilight's Cult.<br />
<br />
<br />

Twilight's Cult - Horde / Alliance Questline<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2010/february/doomsdaymessage_small.jpg (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2010/february/doomsdaymessage.jpg)<br />
<br />
Quest - Prophecies of Doom (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/25228/prophecies-of-doom/) / Prophecies of Doom (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/25228/prophecies-of-doom/)<br />
Objective - Listen to a speech given by a Doomsayer in the Drag and obtain copies of the pamphlets &quot;Elemental Fire for the Soul&quot;, &quot;What Does 'The End of All Things' Mean for Me?&quot;, and &quot;Finding Security and Comfort in a Doomed World&quot;.<br />
Description<br />
Harbingers of doom are nothing new on the streets of Orgrimmar, but I'm worried about this latest batch. These people are organized and they've attracted a lot of attention in the Drag, where they seem to congregate. I've thought about rounding them up or otherwise disrupting their activities, but that will just drive them underground. We need to find out more about them. Would you go to the Drag, listen to what these doomsayers are spreading, and gather any literature you can find about their ideas? <br />
<br />
Quest - Signs of the Times (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/25254/signs-of-the-times/) / Signs of the Times (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/25282/signs-of-the-times/)<br />
Objective - Setup 5 Warning Posters around the Valley of Strength, the Drag, or the Valley of Honor.<br />
Description<br />
We've got to do something to reduce interest in this doomsday cult, but I'm hesitant to take much action until we know more about who is behind this group. I've had my men place markers around heavily traveled areas in Orgrimmar. Take these posters and set them up where you see the markers. They won't discourage the most determined of seekers, but it's a first step in exposing this cult. The Horde has enough to deal with as it is, without people wilfully spreading lies too. <br />
<br />
Quest - Infiltrating the Cult (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/25288/infiltrating-the-cult/) / Infiltrating the Cult (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/25290/infiltrating-the-cult/)<br />
Objective - Speak to a Doomsayer Orgrimmar's Drag to join the cult, then put on your Recruit's Robe.<br />
Description<br />
The streets of Orgrimmar are wild with rumors about the cult's origins and practices. There's only one way to know the truth about this group, &lt;name&gt;. You're going to join them. Approach one of the Doomsayers in the Drag and tell them you wish to join their group. With any luck, they will give you instructions to introduce yourself to one of the group's leaders and tell you where the group is hiding. Don any clothing given to you by the doomsayer; you'll need it to gain entry to the group's hideout. <br />
<br />
Quest - Spreading the Word (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/25380/spreading-the-word/) / Spreading the Word (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/25415/spreading-the-word/)<br />
Objective - While wearing your Doomsday Message, visit the East Zeppelin Tower, the West Zeppelin Tower, and the town square of Razor Hill.<br />
Description<br />
Welcome to the farm, &lt;name&gt;. Everyone here works to earn &lt;his/her&gt; keep. For some, that means caring for the animals. Others are responsible for working on our construction projects. Still others work to spread our message among the people and I think that's a good place for you to start. Take this board. It bears a short message about our beliefs. While wearing the board, visit the eastern and western zeppelin towers outside Orgrimmar's gates, as well as the town square of Razor Hill, to the south. <br />
<br />
Quest - The Master's Plan (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/25416/the-masters-plan/) / The Master's Plan (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/25343/the-masters-plan/)<br />
Objective - Learn more about the cult's plans at the altar in the eastern part of the Jaggedswine Farm.<br />
Description<br />
You're fitting in well here, &lt;name&gt;, but there is more to us than daily chores and spreading the message. I'm sure you heard a little bit about it when you first joined. As you know, this world is ending and the unprepared will die painful deaths. We have been given a gift, an opportunity to become something greater and more powerful. Overseer Golbaz is will be preparing a ritual before the altar at the eastern end of the farm. Wait there for him, and learn more of your new brothers and sisters. <br />
<br />
Quest - The Doomsday Plan (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/25417/the-doomsday-plan/) / The Doomsday Plan (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/25347/the-doomsday-plan/)<br />
Objective - Take the Elemental Devices to Blood Guard Torek in Orgrimmar's Valley of Strength.<br />
Description<br />
The first batch of elemental devices are ready. Your task will be to conceal them inside the city of Orgrimmar. The devices will unleash their fire elementals at the proper time. Don't worry, &lt;name&gt;, you'll be safely away before that happens. Do not do anything that would draw attention to yourself. &lt;The overseer hands you a package containing several of the elemental devices. This is just the kind of proof that Blood Guard Torek was hoping you'd uncover. You should probably bring the devices to him.&gt; <br />
<br />
Quest - Thwarting Twilight's Hammer (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/25418/thwarting-twilights-hammer/) / Thwarting Twilight's Hammer (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/25348/thwarting-twilights-hammer/)<br />
Objective - Break Elemental Devices to release their elementals. You must defeat 5 Raging Fire Elementals.<br />
Description<br />
You can't have been the only person sent into Orgrimmar to deploy those devices containing fire elementals. We have to find and disable the rest of the devices before set their captive elementals free and burn down the city. Are you familiar enough with the devices to destroy them? You need to break them open before the fire elementals inside have had time to reach full strength. They should be easy to defeat if you open the devices early. The cultists have probably put them all over the city. <br />
<br />
Quest - Warn King Wrynn (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/25425/warn-king-wrynn/) / Warn the Warchief (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/25351/alert-the-warchief/)<br />
Objective - Speak with Thrall at Grommash Hold in Orgrimmar's Valley of Wisdom.<br />
Description<br />
You have successfully defended Orgrimmar from the threat posed by this Twilight's Hammer cult, &lt;name&gt;, and without shedding the blood of our own people. Our enemy will not rest for long. I cannot imagine that Cho'Gall will accept defeat so easily. You must take word to Thrall. Go to the Valley of Wisdom and speak to him in Grommash Hold. Tell the warchief that our enemies have shown themselves and we must be prepared for their return. <br />
<br />

<br />
Brewfest is Here<br />
<br />
Celebrated by both the Horde and the Alliance, the Brewfest ( http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/events/brewfest/ ) is a time to enjoy the fermented fruits of the harvest: pretzels, cheese, and booze! The competing breweries Thunderbrew, Barleybrew, and the Ogres, all come together outside of all the major cities in a bid to outdo each other with their special ales, meads, and beers. This year's iteration of the holiday includes new achievements. Brewfest runs from September 20 to October 5.<br />
<br />
If you're wondering why I didn't news about it earlier, there is your answer.<br />
I’m sorry to say that, at present, there is no new Brewfest Stein for this year, nor is there planned to be. :(<br />
<br />
Sincere apologies for any annoyance this may cause you, but hopefully some will be pleased by the ability to catch up on something missed out year. (Source (http://forums.wow-europe.com/thread.html?topicId=14713272572&amp;pageNo=1&amp;sid=1#4))<br />
<br />
[...] There may be nothing new for characters who have achieved everything in the previous year, but let's not generalize for the entire player base. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26850257604/blizzard-confirms-brewfest-not-worth-it/))<br />

Blue Posts<br />
Guild Reputation Leveling<br />
You are currently only earning guild rep from questing. Based on this, your rep gain speed will be slow since you are missing out on the other two ways to earn it. (rated BG's and boss kills) We just activated guild xp on dungeons so you should see the rate increase from that. You will see another increase once rated BG's are active. Guild achievements will not affect guild rep since the xp that you earn goes directly to the guild and not the players.<br />
<br />
We are watching the rep gain rate both internally and on the beta and we will tune as necessary right up to launch. Guild rep gain is scaled based on the amount of time we think a player should need to invest in a guild to earn the rewards and contribute. It's not something that you can just &quot;grind out&quot; like a normal world faction. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26435286221/guild-reputation/))<br />
<br />
Tol Barad<br />
Leaving Tol Barad<br />
Portals that lead back to Stormwind and Orgrimmar will be present in the next build. These portals can be found on the peninsula island at your respective faction camps. We will also open a portal for the winning team at the raid entrance to Baradin Hold. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26725723733/can-you-leave-tol-barad-without-hearthing/))<br />
<br />
Tunnel System<br />
Those 3 micro dungeons will be closed off during the main battle. Anyone in them will be kicked out. They are there to support daily questing in the zone between battles. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26560865999/tol-barad-tunnel-system-question/))<br />
<br />
Tol Barad daily dungeon quests<br />
Many of the features in Tol Barad have been a work in progress over the past few weeks. Our next push should be in a much more polished state and ready for testing. Thank you for all the reports, this info is extremely useful as we move along in development.<br />
<br />
A few things to note:<br />
<br />
--One of the three micro dungeons is chosen at random after each Tol Barad battle. This comes along with its accompanying quests. This is 100% random.<br />
<br />
--These quests are ONLY available for the winners of the game and must be completed in the 2.5hrs before the next game starts.<br />
<br />
--A total of 6 quests unlock for the winner of each game. 3 take place in one of the randomly chosen micros and the other 3 take place out on the island.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps clear things up. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26723613120/bugs-tol-barad/))<br />
<br />
Reputation leveling<br />
The rep vendors for both Baradin's Wardens and Hellscream's Reach will be fully available in the next build. We had a few hiccups in this last push.<br />
<br />
Reputation for these Tol Barad factions can be earned from doing the daily quests, winning a tol barad battle, defeating the raid boss in Baradin Hold or by purchasing commendations from the rep vendors. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26726015732/is-horde-tol-barad-quartermaster-available/))<br />
<br />
Respawns<br />
The defenders respawn in the center of the island (Baradin Hold), and the attackers respawn at the graveyard nearest the node. So, in a straight fight where both sides are killing at the same effectiveness the defenders should eventually lose. So presumably, if you're fighting a losing battle as defense your better option is to try to re-secure one of the other points. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26725956552/major-tol-barad-issue/))<br />
<br />
Classes<br />
20% Melee/Ranged Haste<br />
Is it just me or does this buff seem too good? In Cataclysm, haste is your main stat when it comes to increasing your resource generation. If you're in a raid group that does not have this buff, it greatly hinders your DPS. <br />
It's not just you. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26850267903/20-melee-ranged-haste/))<br />
<br />
Tank damage on PTRs<br />
The damage being done by Lich King-level mobs is currently higher than intended on the PTR. That's not a good surrogate for what tank healing will be like at 85 in appropriate gear. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26850257683/ptr-tank-damage-still-spikey/))<br />
<br />
Healing<br />
Deep Healing Mastery<br />
We like the shaman version. The druid one is problematic for a couple of reasons. Conceptually, a hot is often the last thing you think of putting on someone who is grievously wounded. Second, at the moment the bonus is only calculated on the initial application and not the ticks. If we can fix that problem, then the druid mastery would be better. It's also possible we'll just redesign it. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26850267419/deep-healing-the-better-you-are/))<br />
<br />

New Restoration Mastery<br />
New Resto druid mastery: Increases the potency of your heals on targets upon which you have a hot.<br />
<br />
It benefits both hots and direct heals equally while still supporting Resto being a healer that cares a lot about hots. It encourages layering different spells while disincentivizing Rejuv blanketing.<br />
<br />
Examples:<br />
<br />
1) You cast Regrowth on someone who has a Rejuv = bonus healing.<br />
2) You cast Nourish on someone who has a Lifebloom = bonus healing.<br />
3) You Swiftmend a Rejuv = bonus healing.<br />
4) You cast a Rejuv on someone who does not have a Regrowth, LB or WG on them = no bonus healing.<br />
5) You cast Rejuv on someone who has a Rejuv = no bonus healing. (You merely refreshed Rejuv.)<br />
6) You cast a Wild Growth = bonus healing on those with preexisting hots. <br />
<br />
C). Rejuv, then LBx3. Rejuv falls off, and LBx3 is refreshed by Nourish. Will the LB ticks retain the mastery benefit? <br />
Yes. There was a hot on the target, so Nourish benefits (from the mastery in addition to Nourish just working that way). <br />
<br />
If someone gets low and they don't have a HoT on them already, are you really going to want to put on a HoT, THEN a heal? Probably not. <br />
My impression is that some of you are going from the extreme of &quot;Rejuv everyone in the raid&quot; to &quot;Rejuv nobody but the tank.&quot; The reality will probably be somewhere in the middle. Some targets will have hots on them and some won't. The more hots you can keep up, the better off you'll be, but you'll have to balance that against the mana cost of doing so. I don't think it's as simple as &quot;always do X.&quot; (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26850267419/deep-healing-the-better-you-are/))<br />

Holy Paladins<br />
We like the change to Daybreak. Read some more posts from fellow paladins if it doesn't make sense to you.<br />
<br />
We're not assuming Conviction is up 100% of the time. Procs that are supposed to be up all the time are usually better designed as passives (unless ramp up time is a concern for some reason).<br />
<br />
Light of Dawn now heals the paladin as well. We will be very surprised if we see many paladins skip the talent.<br />
<br />
Let's keep the QQ under control. If you're so frustrated that our vision of the paladin doesn't align with yours or if you're blinded by rage that we can't see how much weaker you are than other healers, than you're better off just not posting. If you keep posting in this manner you'll just get banned anyway so the effect will be the same. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26850276521/state-of-holy-paladins-build-12984/))<br />

Shadow Mastery Scaling<br />
It's easy to increase the bonus per mastery point for Shadow if crit ends up being a far better stat. It's a little trickier to get Shadow (or any dot class) to devalue haste. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26859187139/shadow-priest-mastery-scaling/))<br />
<br />
Use of Power Word: Shield as Discipline<br />
We don't want Disc just bubbling everyone all the time. That strategy is too effective on live given how simple (and arguably boring) it is. Disc should use a lot PW:Shield a lot more than Holy, but that doesn't mean it should solve every problem for you.<br />
<br />
I'm not seeing the massive throughput differences between Disc and Holy, even on the EJ post you're referencing. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26859267852/priest-discipline-lacking-majorly/))<br />

Rogue concerns<br />
Passive damage -- While the combat log says that you are doing a lot of auto attacking, it's not telling you the full story. A lot of what rogues have to manage (say SnD and Envenom) then boost your autoattacks or poison damage. If we changed SnD to instead be a separate dot for the same overall damage, all of a sudden your combat logs would show less &quot;passive&quot; damage. As long as good rogues can do better damage than bad rogues, we think it's fine.<br />
<br />
Combat's mastery -- The big missing piece of the puzzle was that Main Guache was supposed to proc Combat Potency. Without that (which it now has), it is pretty lackluster.<br />
<br />
20% melee / ranged haste buff -- This is something we're evaluating. It's a really serious buff for rogues and warriors particularly, to the extent that your dps drops significantly without it. This suggests we need to nerf the buff (in the same way we changed e.g. Curse of Elements from 13% to 8%) and buff affected classes to compensate. We just don't want the swing to be that big when you don't have it.<br />
<br />
Mana reducing talents -- We just disagree that rogues are singled out here, though if you see some dps classes that can spend all of their points on dps and skip anything utiltiy related, please bring them up so we can evaluate them. It's always possible that the community (correctly or incorrectly) perceives a talent we intended to be optional utility as mandatory dps. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26859267996/questions-for-devs-about-rogues/))<br />
<br />
[...] Mana reducing talents = the OP was concerned about talents like Deadened Nerves that for PvE really translate into reducing the mana healers spend on heals. Apologies if I short-handed too much.<br />
<br />
We want dps classes to consider these useful talents rather than just dismissing survival as the healers' jobs while they go into dps tunnel vision mode. The OP was expressing the concern that rogues had too many of these talents relative to other classes. I responded that I didn't think that was the case but players are welcome to point out other dps trees that don't match.

As we have said several times now, there are zero players outside of these halls doing Cataclysm raids yet, and the high level PvP is just starting to get there. If we were certain warriors would never, ever get into a state where they couldn't spend rage fast enough with Heroic Strike alone, then Inner Rage might be a lot less important. We're just not convinced that is the case yet, nor do we think any amount of theorycrafting can prove that is the case without actual first-hand experience.<br />
<br />
If normalization and the new HS model have fixed the problem forever, then awesome. It's just too early to know that. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26850256905/inner-rage-math/))<br />
<br />
AE Damage / Blood and Thunder<br />
You shouldn't be dependent on Blood and Thunder to generate enough AE damage. It's there mostly for those cases where you can't always keep reapplying an AE ability but want to keep threat. In other words, a warrior who skips the talent shouldn't feel like they can't AE tank at all. You shouldn't feel like you have to open with Rend every AE pull. A more typical scenario would be on a fight where you know you're going to be AE tanking for a long time, you use Rend after your initial Thunder Clap or Shockwave. (Likewise, Thunder Clap buffing Shockwave shouldn't mean you never, ever touch Shockwave until the buff is applied.)<br />
Thunder Clap's damage may just be too low.<br />
<br />
We'll discuss pulling the GCD cost from Inner Rage. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26859267264/warriors-12984/))</div></div><hr />

If somebody reading this can't understand the significance of why dailies need to be available for both factions at all times (with extra dailies for the winner), then think about this: the losers would just leave and go back to whatever they were doing at the end of the battle. There'd be no incentive to stick around, except to gank the winners, which, while it is some incentive, doesn't compare to the incentive of still having dailies to complete.

Tol Barad has multiple dailies that have nothing to do with who has control, so cool your jets ^^ As you can see you only get a few bonus quests for controlling TB.<br />

Yeah, wot he is saying though Snorg is that to do 10man you only need 10 5-hc geared players rather than 25. So ensidia/paragon and whoever is likely just to build 10man teams on the fly with the luckiest 10 players from 5mans. Not saying thats a bad thing though. Im sure by the time ensidia have thier 1st team 1/2 way through there 2nd team will be rdy 2 give it a go. After all it was the same b4 only with the luckiest 25 people ^.^</div></div><hr />

<br />
There's not an incoming SnD nerf.<br />
They say it's fine that we, rogues, have that passive damage (cause it depends on us keeping SnD or Envenom buffs, etc.).<br />
They say our dps drops too much if we do not have available the 20% haste buff and intend to nerf the buff (the one provided by, for example, Frost DKs).<br />
So, where do you see any incoming SnD nerf? Learn to read and don't QQ that quickly :/<br />
<br />
PS: I would even call it an overall buff, as we will perform better (or at least like other dps classes) if we don't have that buff in our raid, we're not that dependent.</div></div><hr />

That makes me happy, an alchemy mount, but as for Brewfest not changing that is very disappointing, as the last 2 &quot;events&quot; listed on the calendar have been non events for me (Harvest Festival and Pirate's Day). I was really hoping there would be changes, or at least something for my main to do as I'm not one of those do every quest, every achievement on every toon type players. Blizzard really does need to keep these vents fresh and alive by making changes every year.</div></div><hr />

I cannot imagine a guild not getting a dozen peeps to 85 and geared the first week or so of beta and running 10 man a couple weeks while they wait on other members to make it to 85 to make the numbers for 25 man.<br />
<br />
What I DID find interesting was the wording of the &quot;added&quot; Realm Firsts First &quot;GUILD&quot; on the realm... While it is almost always a guild that kills the bosses first anyway... why specify &quot;guild&quot;?</div></div><hr />

<br />
A counter argument is that with 10 man heroic, blizzard can fine tune the encounter so, that one player making one mistake will ensure a wipe. But with 25 man they need to ensure some margin of error due to more coordination required.<br />
<br />
Come to think of it, it is easier to design a 10 man encounter where the movement/dps/healing requirements are extremely tight, than a 25 man encounter, where the simple coordination between the players must be calculated into the difficulty.<br />
<br />
Besides apart from the handfull of guilds actually able to kill Heroic Lich King, most guilds have more than a few warm bodies in every 25 man raid. Its more common on my server to see a guild having killed heroic lick king 10 man, but not 25 man. The skilled 10 man are getting dragged down by the 15 medium skilled players</div></div><hr />

Yes, but some of the 4.0.1 patch is already on the background downloader. As for the &quot;full cycle of events&quot;, even on live servers these events will last 3 weeks tops. The 4.0.3 patch will probably go in the week before release. <br />

Shut up - dont give feedback cause we know your class sucks and we want it to be that way. <br />
<br />
In other words - they really dont care what players think.<br />
<br />
In other words &quot;you can't read&quot;. He wasn't saying &quot;Shut Up&quot; or &quot;we don't care what you think&quot;. He was saying &quot;stop nerd raging&quot;. I imagine it's hard to understand, given the way you worded your own post, but Blizzard doesn't consider &quot;OMFG you screwed Pallies up, and now we suck and can't heal! I hate the new healing system, make it like it used to be, I want spam HL! You suck I hate you and I hope you die in fire!&quot; to be useful feedback. They also don't consider it useful feedback when you complain about something, they answer you, then you complain about the exact same thing again, with no additional evidence or information. <br />
<br />
What Blizzard needs for feedback is not &quot;This sucks&quot; or &quot;You suck&quot; or even &quot;Why do you hate Pallies?&quot;. They want &quot;Ability X is over/underpowered, because of reason Y (which preferably has math, or at least a vague understanding of what the ability does and how it interacts with other abilities) and reason Z.&quot; Or &quot;When I do X, Y doesn't happen like it's supposed to. (or vice versa)&quot;. <br />
<br />
Look at the Druids. Someone made a reasonable comment &quot;Our healing mastery is tied to HoTs, but when we most need the bonus healing (when someone is dying), casting a HoT first won't be an option.&quot; So Blizz is looking at changing it (They won't necessarily do it, but they're looking at it). Note how the complaint is phrased &quot;X is a problem, for Y reason&quot;. Note that &quot;Y reason&quot; is not: &quot;Because I hate it&quot;, &quot;Because it's killing my class&quot;, or &quot;Because you hate Druids&quot;. It's a reasonably thought out reason that points to a legitimate possible design issue. <br />
<br />
So, when presenting feedback: <br />
<br />
1) Don't be a douche.<br />
2) Don't present the same issues over and over. If you presented it once, it's noted. They'll change it or they won't. Just because you suggested doesn't make it a good idea, and even if it's a good idea that doesn't mean it can be added and balanced in a timely fashion.<br />
3) Present reasons for why you think things are problems. Real reasons based on real experience, an understanding of why things work the way they work, and, if possible, math.<br />
4) Don't be a douche.</div></div><hr />

It consists of two islands, the northern one having 5 dailies for both factions at all times, regardless of which faction is controlling Tol Barad.<br />
The southern island is where the &quot;battle-zone&quot; is, which is also where the winner will get up to 12 extra dailies (depending on RNG).<br />
<br />
The 12 extra dailies works like this:<br />
There's 3 dailies taking place out in the open.<br />
Then there's 3 zones having 3 dailies each, these zones are in underground dungeons, and only 1 of them is unlocked at a time.<br />
The dungeon being unlocked between 2 battles are chosen at random, hence the RNG. So if unlucky you gain only 6 extra dailies from the southern island (given that it's the same dungeon being unlocked every time you win).<br />

I seen a few refer to &quot;unless it's as hard as 3D 10&quot; and well but if you think about it probably will be. Blizzard said they were tuning 10 man to be as close to 25 as possible. <br />
<br />
10 man might be easier to coordinate, but you gotta remember it's less forgiving, one death or 2 and it's usually over. 25 man you can get away with a lot more than that. Also factor in the diminishing returns on battle rez. <br />
<br />
Don't disagree with it until you see the difficulty for yourself. My main concern is how 25 man is going to be compensated</div></div><hr />

He wasn't saying &quot;Shut Up&quot; or &quot;we don't care what you think&quot;. He was saying &quot;stop nerd raging&quot;.<br />
Actually that's pretty much exactly what was said.<br />
<br />
If you're so frustrated that our vision of the paladin doesn't align with yours ..Then you're better off just not posting. If you keep posting in this manner you'll just get banned anyway so the effect will be the same.<br />
<br />
I don't see how you can take it any differently. Oh and I know you will think I am one of the ones QQing about paladins sucking. Nope, go check the forums, same name. I like most of the changes, and I post good feedback. This is just blatantly what was said. If you don't like what we are doing, stop posting or you will get banned. This is nothing new at all. WoW forums are generally accepted as a joke because of the dictatorship and censorship issues. Unlike other companies though they make you go to the forums for things instead of trying to resolve them as they should. <br />
<br />
<br />
I imagine it's hard to understand, given the way you worded your own post, but Blizzard doesn't consider &quot;OMFG you screwed Pallies up, and now we suck and can't heal! I hate the new healing system, make it like it used to be, I want spam HL! You suck I hate you and I hope you die in fire!&quot; to be useful feedback. They also don't consider it useful feedback when you complain about something, they answer you, then you complain about the exact same thing again, with no additional evidence or information.<br />
<br />
What Blizzard needs for feedback is not &quot;This sucks&quot; or &quot;You suck&quot; or even &quot;Why do you hate Pallies?&quot;. They want &quot;Ability X is over/underpowered, because of reason Y (which preferably has math, or at least a vague understanding of what the ability does and how it interacts with other abilities) and reason Z.&quot; Or &quot;When I do X, Y doesn't happen like it's supposed to. (or vice versa)&quot;. <br />
<br />
Evidence, and math have been posted on the forums. Along with screen shots, I posted a few myself. ALL of these things were ignored. If you got your head out of your butt, and stopped being such a fanboy you would see this for yourself. The only answers we get are to shut the hell up, and take in the butt or we can gtfo off their game. To be honest that is perfectly acceptable. It isn't MY game, it isn't YOURS. It is THEIR game, and they can do with it what they damn well please. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
1) Don't be a douche.<br />
2) Don't present the same issues over and over. If you presented it once, it's noted. They'll change it or they won't. Just because you suggested doesn't make it a good idea, and even if it's a good idea that doesn't mean it can be added and balanced in a timely fashion.<br />
3) Present reasons for why you think things are problems. Real reasons based on real experience, an understanding of why things work the way they work, and, if possible, math.<br />
4) Don't be a douche.<br />
<br />
Let me rephrase that for you to match the blue post<br />
1. Don't disagree, disagreement will be tolerated to a point. If our rabid fanbois don't attack enmass we will simply ban you.<br />
2. Don't present the same issues over and over. It doesn't matter that something is broken, it doesn't matter that we will not fix it. That is how it is, and you will damn well like it and keep subing. Or don't, see how much we give a crap about losing 1 sub punk. <br />
3. Present all the reasons you want, but just remember If you're vision of the paladin doesn't align with ours you will just get banned. <br />
4. Better yet, don't post. Just give us your credit card info, that's really all we care about anyway. Lets be honest, you are going to kee p playing. For now there isn't much competition to wow, and we know it. So we can act like jerks if we want. That will all change in a few months though, but then so will our attitude. To top it off we will be offering you more incentives to stay and recruit friends, like a shiny pony. Because the more friends you have that play, the more likely you are to stay even if we make fun of you openly. <br />
<br />
Just remember this <br />
If you keep posting in this manner you'll just get banned anyway so the effect will be the same.<br />
It's the last part that should grab your attention. The effect will be the same. Your point will still be ignored. Thank you and have a nice day. <br />
<br />
Oh and to the guy that wanted to punch GC, lol. I wish man. He's just a guy that enjoys the power trip. What more can you expect though from a company that openly makes fun of it's subscribers at conventions. Think about it, would you goto a star trek convention if the actors were laughing at you and making jokes about you? Well at Blizz they know they can now, and they know people will ignore it.</div></div><hr />

I thought by now Blizzard would have known that people are selfish. <br />
<br />
A guild master will do this: &quot;I pick, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you and you since I like you the most and you have the best gear&quot; &quot;The rest of you in the guild can form your own 10-man. I dont really care&quot;<br />
<br />
I'm a class leader of my guild and one of those whos been in the guild for the longest so I'd probably be in the realm first kill. But I'm really worried that this would kill alot of moral within a guild if only 10 of 30-35 people who activly raids can have a realm first.</div></div><hr />

It's a shame that this comment is almost certainly bark and not bite. Dps will only take survival talents if there is also some dps increase baked in with it, they are pvping, or they have no choice, and there's been little banter from devs to encourage taking them. There's been QQ about those types of talents since the 31 trees were first implented from all dps specs who have to take them, and dps seem to be getting a slap on the wrist compared to the healer change and the tank ability changes, but we will see I suppose.<br />

In other news, that Vial of the Sands seriously makes me reconsider speed leveling my future Druid so I can work on my Shaman (and his alchemy) first.

Actually, you can, and it is completely asinine that you seriously enjoy the fact that Blizz is breaking with tradition for... no conceivable reason. All people want... is a different colored stein, mostly because we get one...EVERY YEAR. Now, if these &quot;Feats of Strength&quot; which, as I am to understand, are not to be attainable after the fact (or generally broad and normally only available for a limited time), were included in the Meta, which they arnt, you, as well as Blizz, might have a leg to stand on. However, you are wrong, and Blizzard is wrong. This is blatant laziness on Blizzard's part, there is absolutely no reason they couldnt just make a red cup to just maintain the status quo.</div></div><hr />

You are full of it. Blizz will Never admit that. Not EVER, if they did that they would lose their punchline at game conventions. With blizz's track record they will just buff paladins through the roof in 2 years. Then they will be like, oh crap, paladins are op. They will stay that way for about a quarter of an expansion, then get nerfed to be balanced. By that point though people want some good ol' fashioned payback, plus they just spend 2 years smashing paladins like they were nothing. They want things the way they were. Blizz will respond by nerfing paladins into the ground. Continue this until the end of wow. Now you know what playing a paladin from release is like.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
So much work left to do for Blizz and time is really getting short ...<br />
<br />
Holy: A total and utter disaster. I have played alle Healing classes in the Beta and Paladin is by far the worst. Terrible manaregeneration , basically a single target healer without being much better at it than all the others and way too limited tools to raid/grp heal.<br />
<br />
The Daybreak change seems nice but all it allows to chaincast instantheals ? Is that fun ? Is that original ? Basically no interaction with holy power left .. maybe something is coming .. i surely hope so.<br />
Paladin is so far behind others in grp healing it isnt even funny any more.<br />
Manareg has been totally gutted , Holy Shock nerfed into oblivion and now Holy Light nerfed by 25% and 50% efficency. I am speechless ...... maybe there will be more positive changes in the nex builds but i urge the devs to take a hard look at our grp heals. The CDs are too long and the usage is nor reliable enough in many scenarions where ppl are spread out und take dmg . Raidhealing like this will be next to impossible. My Priest heals so effortless its a blessing compared to the Pala. We need help ...<br />
<br />
<br />
at least thats how i see it. Am i seeing things to negative ? What do you guys think ? <br />
<br />

I'm not saying the sky is falling, maybe things will change. IF, and that is an IF, they don't though paladin healing will be nothing but a joke. Unable to heal even 5 mans sounds fun. I can't tell you about the beta, but I can tell you what paladins are like on the PTR, and I can do it without GC threatening to ban me for voicing my opinion. <br />
<br />
At least I hope, not too versed here. Maybe I will get banned here for voicing dissent with blizz.<br />
<br />
I will give you a further example fanboy. So you can go all rabid on me in defense of GC.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Q u o t e:<br />
Oh yea, and before I go. You need to learn how to actually design a class and role. Basing a large portion of threat around a chance to occur is extremely poor game design. Especially when you're trying to base a fight on that person's ability to preform said role to a make or break point. &quot;Oh the DPS pulled agro, why? Oh because the tank just got unlucky with their AS procs, again, for the 4th time in a row. Oh well&quot;. That statement is hardly acceptable in a raiding environment.<br />
<br />
Do us all a favor, and actually play the game you design. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Hope you enjoyed your contribution to the beta, because it has come to an end. <br />

Yeah, see even if that guy was angry sounding he makes a valid points. Yet instead of going &quot;hey maybe you are right, and it might be a bad decision to make your threat generation random&quot; it's well you disagreed with us you are off the beta. Keep defending. I can keep posting until I am banned here. You won't win though, because as rabid as you are about defending GC and Blizz, they aren't worth it.</div></div><hr />

lololololol there's so many terrible paladins who play that two button class that nobody would shed a single tear if the entire class just managed to vanish overnight. Literally 99% of the paladins who play this game are simply abysmal. Good thing that they're nerfing the entire class into the ground after 2 expansions of paladins being the only class that's capable of healing a tank. Good thing they're getting rid of ret too, which is a complete joke 3 button class to play. Hopefully ret paladins are in the bottom of PVP and PVE, right where they should be.</div></div><hr />

Well you share the same attitude as GC so no chance of you getting a ban on the forums. As to the only class capable of healing a tank though, I've had plenty of good healers from every class, it just takes a little more skill than paladin healing. As for the rest you are pretty right. They are nerfing them to the ground, and don't worry there isn't a chance of paladins being in top or really even middle pvp in cata.</div></div><hr />

SnD isn't going to be hit with the nerf bat. It's icy talons/windfury/whatever other passive 20% buffs that are getting hit with the nerf bat. SnD is a self only finisher that they seem to like (they consider it no less active than a DoT.)</div></div><hr />

I'm not a huge WotLK Paladin fan, but no class deserves to be treated like dirt. Treat the morons who flock to bandwagon jobs like dirt, sure. But there should be something worth playing when the mindless horde (no pun intended) moves on to whatever is the flavor of the patch. I don't really understand what's &quot;wrong&quot; with Paladin on the beta since I've been dedicating my time to other classes and UI, but well-documented arguments should not be brushed off. It is incredibly disrespectful to the people either making an argument or attempting to, and you make yousrself apprear to be someone to ignore in the process. No one wins.<br />

A lot of what rogues have to manage (say SnD and Envenom) then boost your autoattacks or poison damage. If we changed SnD to instead be a separate dot for the same overall damage, all of a sudden your combat logs would show less &quot;passive&quot; damage. As long as good rogues can do better damage than bad rogues, we think it's fine.&quot;<br />
<br />
Well that's bullshit. It may not be completely passive but it sure feels that way. After you put up your SnD and you start Evenoming you don't have to think about it, and the dps difference between a rogue who's careful with his envenom buff and one who simply envenoms whenever he has the energy and cbps isn't that huge.<br />
<br />
They should buff mutilate back where it was. It's a fucking joke the damage it does in pvp. I didn't play a rogue to be a goddamn warlock who has to stand in melee range for his dots to tick.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well my arguments here are not really about paladins. They are about the way blues treat people that are giving them the feedback. If you want some numbers though, I can provide you with some basic ones from a post I put on the forums. If you would like to look at one of my posts about the changes. <br />
http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=26850266706&amp;postId=268477408748&amp;sid=1#0<br />
<br />
Read it, then judge. Aside from that I will provide you with some of the basic reasons that have been pointed out.<br />
1. Mitigation is pretty low for paladins. We don't have high amounts of dodge or parry. That is the domain of druids/dks. Paladins rely heavily on block. Now, why is that so important you ask. Simple. Block is being changed to a 30% reduction when you block. So look at it this way. Our primary defense is rng based. IF we block, then we can prevent 30% of the damage. Say you have 4 guys on you, each hitting for 1k damage. Now as it is now IF (and that is a big if) you blocked each of their hits you would still take 2800 damage, compared to the 4000 unblocked. That is if you managed to block all of their hits. Now that isn't likely to happen for a few reasons. Right now you can see my block on the armory. In the ptr it is quite a bit lower. With the current model I could potentially block all of the damage coming in, because it isn't based off of boss scaling. This is supposed to help with boss fights, at least in theory. However if we test that theory we can see it is only slightly better. As gear increases so does block value. Since only paladins and warriors even tank using a shield simply putting more block value on items as ilevel increased would have kept them both at good levels. Instead the two classes druid/dk both have a chance at 100% damage mitigation, and at pretty high levels. This means that warriors and paladins will take much more damage over longer periods. While dodge/parry/shield block are all rng based, the simple fact that we only have a chance to remove 30% of the damage. Rather let me ask &quot;if you had a trinket that said 30% chance on a physical melee hit to block 30% of the damage&quot; or one that said &quot;40% chance while being attacked by physical melee dmg to take no damage&quot; which one would you choose? Hell for the sake of this argument imagine it said the chance to block was at 40% and the chance to dodge at 30%, would it really change your decision? But, mastery will fix it and I hear you Paladins have a fancy holy shield. Yes, holy shield increases our chance to block by 15%, so we have an increased chance to take less damage. The downside is it triggers off two abilities that need holy power. <br />
<br />
2. Aside from that O.k. so you might say big deal, even with that 2800 that gets through you have armor. Yes, I sure do. Unfortunately it is being nerfed by a pretty big amount. They are reducing armor across the board, even going so far as to remove bonus armor from trinkets. This means that over time the paladin/warrior simply takes more and more damage, requiring more and more heals. This is a tax on a healers mana, this will mean that if the group continues something will have to give. You honestly can't expect healers to be pouring mana into you to keep you up, while also doing their damn best to keep the group up. The paladin will have to heal some. We have a choice, use our holy power for a heal, or cast.<br />
<br />
3.You are probably thinking at this point, so what. You take a little more damage, and you require more healing. Yous till hit like a truck..right? Wrong. Here is a screen shot my HotR hitting multiple targets. Check out that big bad burst. <br />
http://img808.imageshack.us/img808/4677/wowscrnshot091410180050.jpg<br />
in the upper left you can see my holy power is max. So naturally I go into a SotR:<br />
http://img138.imageshack.us/img138/6135/wowscrnshot091410180055.jpg<br />
Our holy powered shield crits for a huge 7869 damage. That's right, all of the saving up to build my holy power, to hit for that. <br />
<br />
O.k. to be fair they have stated damage isn't set yet. O.k., well how the hell are we supposed to give you feed back. Paladins don't get agro just by being present, no matter how many people on the forums want you to believe it. Even if they tweak them by a bit, unless they tweak them much higher this is going to be much lower than on live. <br />
<br />
So paladins take more damage, they mitigate less damage, and they deal less damage. I'm really not sure how you define a nerf, but to me that sounds about as close as you can get. <br />
<br />
4. Aside from all of the above, our class is so entirely RNG (random number gen) based now. Our big defenses has a chance to block. It is better than the current system in only ONE scenario I can think of. IF you happen to be against a boss, that does melee physical strikes, then you have a chance at reducing one of those by 30%<br />
<br />
I could actually go on a few pages, but this is incredibly long as it is. I would consider some of the things above as being constructive. Yet no matter how often this is posted it is disregarded to the point of &quot;agree with us or else&quot;. Still with everything listed above I will damn sure keep playing my paladin.

This is what I like, and while I think some more testing needs to be done as far as numbers are concerned (because honestly quite a few of those things can be tweaked with numbers, even a percentage boost to procs), this is the kind of thing that will help people with a more objective view but no ability to test it. Your post didn't seem to be one of the ones GC was talking about, though, and it would surprise me if it was. I thought they *liked* that kind of feedback, and said they did not that long ago. Even a constructive post laced with insults can be quite infuriating I imagine, considering how much whining there is on the forums. I assume they just want to nip it in the bud, they know what their current reputation is. I also know that they aren't always right, but still.</div></div><hr />
