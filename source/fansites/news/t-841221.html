Patch 4.0.6 - PTR Notes Update<br />
PvP<br />
Tol Barad<br />
<br />
Attacking forces will receive a 200% capture speed bonus when they control 2 keeps.<br />
Defending forces will receive a 200% capture speed bonus when they control all 3 keeps.<br />
Daily quest creatures, herbs, minerals, etc. will only spawn when Tol Barad is in the quest phase between battles. There will be 5-minute and 1-minute warnings before the quest phase ends. The quest phase ends 15 minutes before the battle for Tol Barad begins and queuing is made available. At that time any players in the daily micro dungeons will be ported just outside. This does not apply to Tol Barad Peninsula or the daily quests there.<br />

Nefarian World 2nd kill by Method<br />
Method (http://www.methodwow.com/) killed Nefarian a few hours ago and is the 2nd guild in the world to take down the big black dragon. It's also the world first kill since the hotfix preventing class stacking but technically, that wasn't an exploit, so I'll just let people debate endlessly about it in comments. Congratulations to them! <br />
<br />

<br />
Statement from Method (http://www.methodwow.com/)<br />
Nefarian down, putting us at 13/13 (finally a breath of fresh air!!!). Thumbs up for the dedication shown by our raiding team.<br />
<br />
The current heroic difficulty of raiding is both enjoyable and demanding. We can all welcome, with open arms, the more challenging raid content, but the sheer quantity of content available since Cataclysm launch has required more time investment than ever before to remain competitive. Personally I would have welcomed a 'reasonable' gate-system or similar to allow for more real life time the past ~2months, especially with xmas/new years/exams etc. Taking a few day breaks over the festive period only to be notified that other guilds were currently raiding obviously wasn't ideal!<br />
<br />
This tier of raiding has unfortunately contained multiple bugs, with bosses like Atramedes, Sinestra, and Nefarian standing out. Sinestra had some notable issues for us; having infinite lines at Twilight orbs making progress prior to this current reset difficult. Twilight Flames properly spawning at the Egg locations in phase 1 was also fixed recently on the fight (can see they are non existent @ Paragon's video). The issues on Nefarian are of more concern, with Blizzard seemingly overlooking certain class abilities on a key encounter mechanic. Unsure as to why it was waited with until after a guild had killed Nefarian before applying the fix, especially with &quot;top guilds&quot; apparently under surveillance, such delayed fixes are harmful to the 'PvE race'.<br />
<br />
Hoping that Blizzard can keep up with the quality of heroic raid difficulty while considering the quantity available and as always more vigorous encounter testing/monitoring.<br />

Dalaran/Shattrath Portals<br />
Portals existed to give people access back to capital cities to reach auction houses and class trainers. Auction houses and class trainers were kept in the old world capitals because we knew that if we didn't require people to go back the old world would be a ghost town.<br />
<br />
Those portals had a few fun side effects like letting people warp all around the world toot-sweet at the shake of a nose to do anything they felt like. This was not the intent of the portals and regardless if people enjoyed being able to zip around, it is not the intent of our travel as it exists now to allow them to do so.<br />
<br />
Now that the old world capitals are the major hubs in the current expansion, the expansion zones are in Azeroth which keeps more people around, and we've decided to add trainers and auction houses to Shattrath and Dalaran to aid in the leveling experience, the portals no longer serve their original purpose and were removed. <br />
<br />
[...] We have no plans to implement the old portals back in the game, but thank you for you reasons as to why they should. They've been noted. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/154818/outland-inconvenience))<br />

Blizzard Art Gallery Update<br />
The World of Warcraft: The Burning Crusade Art Gallery (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/media/artwork/wow-bc#/1) has been updated with five pieces representing the Warcraft universe. Make your way through the gallery to take a glimpse into the process behind bringing Blizzard games to life, and the artistry those games have inspired.<br />
The high res version of the Kil'Jaeden artwork is a 17280 x 10368 image (16mb!), you can probably make an awesome poster out of it.<br />

They're all using Potion of Illusion (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/58489/potion-of-illusion/) to mock Paragon.<br />
<br />
It's unfortunate that Paragon's kill of Sinestra was an unfinished version (missing the Twilight Flames) and that Paragon's kill of Nefarian had a literally fight-breaking bug in it (Feral Druid's Rip stacking), but I don't blame Paragon for either of those (mainly the first).<br />
<br />
Also, Method's kill of Al'Akir was post-nerf, and Paragon's kill of Al'Akir was pre-nerf (and only very barely pre-nerf).<br />
<br />
All in all, it's clear who the top guilds in the world are, grats to both.</div></div><hr />

Defending forces will receive a 200% capture speed bonus when they control all 3 keeps.<br />

Or is it designed so Alliance have to have tiwice the numbers to capture the base?</div></div><hr />

I mean, it doesn't exactly stop the defenders squatting on 1 keep the whole time. It's pretty difficult to break them sometimes.<br />
<br />
Also, love the kill pic. Hilarious stuff.</div></div><hr />

It means that if you have all three keeps, you'll be able to fill out your control bar very very quickly instead of spending like 2-3 minutes waiting for it to slowly fill.</div></div><hr />

It makes it easier to hold them if you have all three but if you lose one you lose that advantage until you recap all 3.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Control occurs once you reach the 75%/80% mark. This just helps it fill up to 100% faster, which is kind of meh.<br />
<br />
It mayyyy actually make it not contest if equal numbers of attackers and defenders collide due to the defenders having a higher capture rate... that would be &quot;interesting&quot;.</div></div><hr />

This is what I'm wondering to. I know the bar moves a tad if you have an advantage number wise, but if we (as attackers) had 2/3 and zerged the 3rd keep with somewhat even numbers compared to the defenders there, would we actually gaining control?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Notice how Paragon doesn't mention other guilds in their statement, but Method spends their statement throwing out excuses on why they weren't the World 1st, you sound pathetic.<br />
<br />
Paragon did what they needed to do to be the World 1st, and Method had all the same opportunities to do so themselves, but they didn't, because apparently they all have such BUSY lives raiding 40+ hours a week.<br />
<br />
And you know they thought they were HILARIOUS when they decided to use potions to all be druids, I bet they had a huge laugh about that one, man you showed them. Maybe if Method was a little more willing to do whatever was needed to kill a boss, they could have some World 1st kills also.<br />
<br />
Absolutely pathetic. Whenever you need to bash someone else to attempt to make yourself look better, you're truly a loser. And for the race to World 1st, Method, you truly are losers.</div></div><hr />

They are removing the normal helm and shoulders from the loot table . Instead their tokens will drop and you just trade them in. That means if your class token drops you can roll on it rather then being SOL because your never got the normal version. You will simply trade in the token to get your heroic piece.<br />
This is simply my take on it and I could be completely wrong</div></div><hr />

Hehe, I reacted to this aswell. No one force anyone to play WoW and with that comment it really sounds like &quot;You should have made some gates or so. Because it's x-mas and other stuff we can't miss. But there was no gates so we had to play anyhow! :( :( :( :( &quot;<br />
But same time WoW also have some responsibility. They know that ppl would play more or less 24/7 till all world firsts was completed. No matter if it's x-mas, new years eve or whatever. BUT, everyone know that ALL do not celebrate these days due to religion or whatever. They have other days they can't play WoW. So I'm guessing it's more fair to have it always open than start to gate just because big holidays etc. Pretty lame comment, coming from a top guild.</div></div><hr />

I agree. Cata zone ports in the other main cities would definitely be helpful. As it is, everyone is hanging out only in two cities (Orgrimmar and Stormwind, respectively). Also, a portal to (but not back from) Dalaran would be nice, to cut back on the major flight time from Borean Tundra that is required after taking the zeppelin.</div></div><hr />

Or is it designed so Alliance have to have tiwice the numbers to capture the base? <br />
<br />
From what I'm reading defending forces get a super cap bonus for having all 4 towers standing. Upon losing one tower they loose this boon. Once two towers are destroyed the attacking team gets this buff instead. The third tower just allows for extra time if needed. <br />
<br />
If 200% extra cap bonus is as significant as I think then this should fix the battles where ppl are zerging down a base at the last second.</div></div><hr />

How quickly people forget this quote from Paragon.<br />
<br />
<br />
Al'Akir was a rather merciless boss overall. The difference on this particular boss is absolutely massive in 10-man compared to 25s due to the area scaling. Congratulations to Dream though for getting the world first in 10-man!<br />
<br />
What a rather backhanded compliment from an apparently affable guild. Considering that, from all the data gathered so far, some of the bosses in 10 are harder in heroic than 25. Why then should it have mattered all of a sudden that Paragon killed the boss in 25 when up until then they had gotten some relatively easier kills doing 25 instead of 10. Put simply it shows Paragon is just as bad as Method and were jealous and took a cheap shot, anything to try and discredit the World 1st kill and somehow prove how much better they are. Paragon were just that much more subtle about it.</div></div><hr />

No, Cho'Gall is. Sinestra is an optional heroic only boss. That's like saying Algalon was the final boss of Ulduar. He wasn't. Yogg was. He was only an optional heroic only boss.<br />

It has nothing to do with what is harder. But everytime i see a guild go &quot;Look we got WF 10 man&quot; it kinda feels like a basketball player showing up at a baseball event going like &quot;We just fucking owned the other team so hard&quot;<br />

Paragon's firstkills where legit, since Blizz had not fixed the encounters as it was time and had Paragon let downed the boss. And yes, I think this could be very frustrating to see the boss downed and after that get buffed. Same with new enrage-timers for Omnotron, Atramades and the fixed one for Maloriak with the next patch. <br />
<br />
It's never great to see a boss get buffed after killed for the first time, even when this buff is more a fix then a buff at all. If you change the circumstances of a competition then the competition is something worthless.<br />
<br />
So grats to both, Paragon and Method for clearing all content (under some different circumstances ^^) and getting back your normal life ^^<br />
<br />
What I liked most in the Method's statement was:<br />
<br />
We can all welcome, with open arms, the more challenging raid content, but the sheer quantity of content available since Cataclysm launch has required more time investment than ever before to remain competitive<br />
<br />
So all you &quot;cata is to small, there is not content&quot;-whiners please stop ^^ It seems there is enough content (PVE) even to engage world first guild so they will say it's a little too much ^^</div></div><hr />

They should not have been punished for using that strat, but niether should they have got any rewards, in my opinion<br />

<br />
LK-mixed colored gems are cheaper then red/blue/yellow. This has always been the case. One could use that for more &quot;bang for Buck&quot; when converting JPs.<br />
One BC Gem has the same NPC value as a LK gem but costs only 78 JP. So basically you would buy these and sell them for the NPC for max profit during dump of surplus JP.<br />
<br />
Now instead of converting 78JP to 5G (uncut) you have to spend 220JP for the same amount of gold. Looks like a nerf to me.</div></div><hr />

It is because Dream, who is a 25 man guild, went and downed it on 10 man BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T do it on 25.<br />

I agree the kill was legit, as otherwise, they would have been banned.<br />
<br />
They should not have been punished for using that strat, but niether should they have got any rewards, in my opinion<br />
<br />
I just think it is sad to see an end-game boss between downed with, clearly, a stratgey that Blizzard didn't, and that trivialised the encounter.<br />
<br />
That said, I am over it, and I don't really care either way<br />
<br />
I don't see why you would have to anticipate Blizzard's intentions? Plus, the same could be said for a raid lets say using 6 warlocks with CoD on Curator. Where is that forbidden? Blizzard can design encounters any way they wish. But they can't limit what kind of group can you bring to the raid.</div></div><hr />

Went back, saw the statement. Here is the part of it that references FTH:<br />
<br />
<br />
It was time to put our gameface on - after a few short (and relaxing) farm raids and a day off, For the Horde managed to snag the first kill on Cho'gall. Congrats to them, but damn does that suck! Just as you think you can afford some slack. With that in mind, there was some really serious catching up to do, as we had only dabbled a bit with some potential tactics for the fight. The pressure was definitely on and you could feel it in the raid.<br />
<br />
Anyone else than me having significant difficulty finding any crying or complaining in that statement? I mean, really, come on. A congratulation and a straight-up admittal of disdain over failure to get there first. :|</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, defenders get a speed buff...when they have all three keeps. All...three...keeps. If the defenders are holding all three keeps, I personally think the attackers are clueless and probably don't deserve to win Tol Barad.<br />
<br />
More importantly, holding two keeps buffs the attacker's cap speed. This can make all the difference when the defenders are turtling the last keep and the attackers can manage to at least hold a larger force on site. It also makes pulling out and zerging another keep risky for the defenders, because with a full stack of attackers, plus the cap buff, it won't take long at all for the attacker to cap the last keep if there are no defenders left to hold it.<br />
<br />
All in all, this should definitely reduce the incline on the uphill struggle blizz has stated they want the attackers to face.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is how they killed Al'Akir:<br />
(Cannot post link due to my new member account, so go to Paragon Website and click on Al'Akir video)<br />
<br />
And these are the hotfix that Blizzard did on 26Jan:<br />
<br />
Throne of the Four Winds<br />
-Al'Akir's Lightning Strike damage has been reduced on 25-player Heroic difficulty. In addition, its effect duration has been reduced to 16 seconds, down from 24 in both modes and difficulties.<br />
-Slipstreams can no longer be used during the Al'Akir encounter.<br />
For people that has 0 familiar with name, Slipstreams are the &quot;tornado&quot; that u use to reach Al'Akir.<br />
<br />
So i am glad that blizzard fixed the Slipstreams (we didn't know that we could use it like Paragon did, our mistake), also we did not ask for a nerf on Lightning Strike, we got it (ofc we were a bit happy), and we had to kill it with it, nothing that we could do about it.<br />
<br />
Anyway, none is QQ, people that say it must have some reading or comprehension problem.<br />
Big GZ to Paragon that killed bosses before us.<br />
Not a big thanks to Blizzard that 2 times changed the rule of the &quot;contest&quot; and that could test bosses on beta in a more accurate way, not in a rush like they did and with some guild cut down from testing it due to low amount of Beta-test-invite received.<br />

Gratz to Method for the first post-fix kill. <br />

Considering no other guild has recorded a kill after they adjusted the MC damage boost portion of the fight (or heck, no kills period without it), means this fight is probably a lot harder than it should be.

<br />
Lets be honest. Just by being able to buy gems, orbs, and rep items, dungeon emblems were far more valuable in Wrath than they are in Cata. An uncut mixed color gem was worth 80-100g, for ten valor points, or ten bosses. That amounts to about 700 JP...which gets you three heavenly dust under the proposed new system...worth about thirty gold. This significantly cuts down on the incentive to run heroics. A full stack of JP gets me all of 255g...and that's about to be reduced when the price change on gems goes into effect. For comparison lets say that under wrath prices, it took about 10jp to earn 1g. Under cata, it's currently about 16jp to earn one gold, and likely to go up to 20jp or more just for one gold.<br />
<br />
This means I have more incentive to go play with myself farming in uldum than to go onto the LFD system or run dungeons with guildies. In wrath a solid day's heroic farming at least gave me orbs to craft gear with and gems to sell or socket upgrades with. Currently in cata I have very little incentive to spend 30-90 minutes tanking dungeons for guildies. I don't even need valor gear...I've purchased every meaningful piece from the valor vendor and all that remains for me is to buy boots and sell them...and they're already underpriced due to players who put quick cash over getting themselves upgrades. The orb is nice...but 90% of my orbs go to my guildies and I still can't keep the tailors from rolling on them.<br />
<br />
(Please note that I am not currently advocating selling chaos orbs for JP. Crafting orbs should only be purchaseable by the level of emblem they make gear for...just like in wrath. Chaos orbs should not be sold for JP until 359 gear is sold for JP.)</div></div><hr />

I don't care about Arch. Never again will until they redesign it and do away with crappy RNG layer BS. The way Arch works it will NEVER be a reliable income unless every common is worth the same. So you really can't compare this to the controlled dump of JP.<br />
<br />
<br />
and spending jp on crafting mats. <br />
<br />
Yeah... that's the entire point of my post. The conversion ratio (in terms of gold) is beyond ridiculous. But instead of buffing it, they nerf the alternate way, people would use instead.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The word nerf gets used far too much these days to describe something we don't like. That took all the meaning out of the word sadly.<br />
Yeah right. To put it as simple as possible for you:<br />
<br />
My gold income from JP-dumps was reduced from 160G per 2500 JP to 75G per 2500 JP. (using 2500JP / stack of cloth as an example, the other conversions are worth even LESS on my servers economy)<br />
<br />
So HOW on Earth is that NOT a nerf by any definition of the word?!</div></div><hr />

I do wish that there was a major hub city on each continent. Let's say Org/UC for Horde and SW/Darnassus for Alliance (I know IF is better than Darnassus, but IF and SW aren't that far apart).<br />
<br />
What they have done is turn Orgrimmar and Stormwind in to the new Dalaran. Some people are experiencing major lag issues in those cities. I do appreciate that they've added secondary hearth spots in each city, though, as it helps a little bit when logging in.</div></div><hr />

How does defending the WF kill of Nef make them a &quot;Fanboy&quot;? Last time I checked, Blizzard stripped World Firsts from guilds that were doing something wrong, (See Ensidia's WF LK). As MikeB aka Fony would say it, &quot;It's not like there's a bouncer standing outside Blackwind Descent counting how many Druids are being brought into the raid&quot;.<br />
<br />
Honestly, who cares if Paragon stacked Feral Druids to get a World First? If it was as big of a deal as everyone is making it seem, then Blizzard would have removed the WF from Paragon and hotfixed it right away. However, Blizzard gave the WF to Paragon, and congratulations to them for that.<br />
<br />
And I would congratulate Method for their Nef kill, but their comments are the worst display of sportsmanship I've ever seen. Just because Method couldn't use the same means to get the kill as Paragon doesn't mean they have the right to call Blizzard out for showing favoritism.</div></div><hr />

Alot of you making comments like this, I think don't realize that these top guilds are paid (sponsored) to raid... And from rumors I've heard they get decent bonuses from getting world firsts...

The problem is taking a 3rd keep on attack is almost impossible even with this 200% capture bonus it wont change things and the problems will continue to persist, if alliance / horde camp entirely in a single keep they could hold it off for the duration of the battle and if all alliance / horde attack it they are vunerable to losing bases. <br />

I honestly cannot see this making a difference at all tbh.</div></div><hr />

Maybe they would class stack too if they had the druids. But anyway doing it the right way (talking about righteousness), even if there are blizzard's faults which you can exploit without being &quot;illegal&quot;, to me is the winner. I mean, if Paragon's life became 50% easier for stacking druids, Method were clearly better on that. And everyone has the right to say their opinion and they can qq about paying a company that gives us buggy product. Calm down people.

I know the bar moves a tad if you have an advantage number wise, but if we (as attackers) had 2/3 and zerged the 3rd keep with somewhat even numbers compared to the defenders there, would we actually gaining control?<br />
<br />
The purpose of the attacker change is obvious. The purpose of the defender ´buff´is a little more subtle... what they are hoping is that it will urge defenders to spread out and actually try to defend all three keeps. If you are actually defending that third keep (and hold the other 2) you will have a strong buff, so even if you are outnumbered, you can still keep the bar from moving.<br />
<br />
Their goal with TB is to have 3 keeps all under constant pressure. Not the current ´chase your tail´thing that we have now where nobdoy really fights or defends anything.<br />
<br />
It´s been 3 weeks straight on my server that one side has held TB.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Notice how Paragon doesn't mention other guilds in their statement, but Method spends their statement throwing out excuses on why they weren't the World 1st, you sound pathetic.<br />
<br />
Paragon did what they needed to do to be the World 1st, and Method had all the same opportunities to do so themselves, but they didn't, because apparently they all have such BUSY lives raiding 40+ hours a week.<br />
<br />
And you know they thought they were HILARIOUS when they decided to use potions to all be druids, I bet they had a huge laugh about that one, man you showed them.  Maybe if Method was a little more willing to do whatever was needed to kill a boss, they could have some World 1st kills also.<br />
<br />
Absolutely pathetic. Whenever you need to bash someone else to attempt to make yourself look better, you're truly a loser. And for the race to World 1st, Method, you truly are losers.<br />
<br />
Paragon - &quot;Al'Akir was a rather merciless boss overall. The difference on this particular boss is absolutely massive in 10-man compared to 25s due to the area scaling&quot;, sounds like a &quot;if we had done it in 10 man we'd have been world first bash to me&quot;.<br />
<br />
Incomplete encounters (sinestra), or buggish (rip), blizzards fault or not, can't be world firsts until fixed, and complet imo.<br />

... What? <br />
<br />
What's the point of that when you already got all 3 keeps... ?<br />
<br />
Or am I missing something... ?<br />
<br />
They are trying to encourage the defenders to spread out and defend all three keeps. If you control all three keeps and have 15 people at all 3, then the attackers will have to bring 30 people to one of your keeps in order to even move the bar.</div></div><hr />

I do wish that there was a major hub city on each continent. Let's say Org/UC for Horde and SW/Darnassus for Alliance (I know IF is better than Darnassus, but IF and SW aren't that far apart).<br />
<br />
<br />
Yeah I've been rumbled to, was nice while it lasted to gather whiptail with no crocs buggin me :(<br />
<br />
What they have done is turn Orgrimmar and Stormwind in to the new Dalaran. Some people are experiencing major lag issues in those cities. I do appreciate that they've added secondary hearth spots in each city, though, as it helps a little bit when logging in.<br />

I'm not talking about farming gold. I'm talking about maintaining a reasonable incentive to grind this content, content that is otherwise irrelevant to me after cata has been out for two months...and I'm not even a fast burner. There's a difference between &quot;inefficient&quot; and &quot;obscene&quot;.<br />
<br />
As I said...the original rate of &quot;jp&quot; to gold came to roughly 8-10 jp per gold. That's already been inflated in cata to 1.5x-2x the amount, taking 15.5 jp per gold in 4.03 selling BC gems (the best option assuming you're not a jewelcrafter). When 4.06 goes live we're looking at 20 jp or more to equal one gold.<br />
<br />
Firstly, 400g for 4000jp isn't a means of farming gold. But it's certainly more comfortable than the options available now. The system worked for the last two content patches of wrath...why does it suddenly not work now? In wrath when you were done getting gear you could buy rep items or gems that were not easy to get otherwise (because they were available from only three sources: JP, Honor, or prospecting titanium).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually I think its pretty sad that people take these things so seriously. I guess I simply never understood why people got woodies for world firsts/ realm firsts whatever. I dont base my performance or fun in the game on what other people accomplish or fail to accomplish in the game. <br />
<br />
As for Tol Barad. Finally. I hope this will fix the problems with the battleground and the defenders having such a huge advantage. I think holding the keep now will be much much harder, and hopefully it sees a frequent changing of hands.<br />

I think what he's saying is a fairly valid point. If you dont give those people who have NO NEED to go in to do heroics, then queue times will stay just as high as ever. <br />
<br />
All in all though, Blizz has addressed some of the more pressing problems with Caty in this patch. Here's hoping they continue looking at other problems and actually come up with a fix.</div></div><hr />

I think they earned the right to make a case for themselves. I love how people are bashing them over that, i guess it gives them an occasion to feel better than them :) Noone is arguing over the case Method is making. If they did had bugs thats Paragon hadn't, because they were more closely watched by GM's during raid progress, what can they do? It does not feel right, and i understand them. Same thing for Paragon, Al'akir 25HM is REALLY much harder than 10, so what's wrong with them stating a well-known fact? Does it diminish the accomplishment of Dream? Certainly not, but using that to call them bad, because they are doing 25-man only and didn't got a world first that matters, while they technically did get one is just funny.</div></div><hr />

The problem is if you start removing incentive for seasoned PvE veterans to run heroics, then others suffer in LFD.<br />
<br />
My two 85s have bought everything with JP already. I almost have the heroic achievement drakes, and I consider myself somewhat casual. The more hardcore already have some valor gear.<br />
<br />
If you remove enough incentive to run heroics, then those people will quit doing heroics, and then the queue times will never get better or maybe even get worse.<br />
<br />
I don't see a problem with heroics being a source of gold. The daily random gives you 83g and they usually take an hour or longer. You get more gold than that doing a hours worth of dailies. Both activities require some attention and effort. It is not as if people are making gold hand-over-fist doing heroics.<br />
<br />
I'm not upset with the change to classic gem prices, but I do find it funny that people whine, &quot;These new JP dumps suck compared to older rewards&quot; and then Blizzard says, &quot;fine! we'll just make the older rewards worse then!&quot;</div></div><hr />

Even if you're buying them to cut you could get far more gold per JP if you bought the ilvl 213 epic BoE bracers from the old valor point vendor in Dalaran. Each bracer costs about 350 points and could probably sell for 300-700g depending on your server, hell maybe even more. People as a whole have more gold now then ever before and when I bought 3 of those bracers the other day to get rid of some JP I just stuck them on the AH for 500g each to see if there was any interest and all 3 sold within the day.<br />
<br />
500g (on average) for 350 JP vs maybe 30g for 220 JP. Even when they bring in the new cata mat vendor, it would still be a better idea to buy those bracers, sell them, and use the money to buy whatever cata mat you want.</div></div><hr />

They HAVE to race to world first to keep their job, as most of them make a living off of raiding since they do it 40+ hours a week, if they take breaks like that that is like quitting your job, even worse. If top end guilds stop getting world first/second kills they loose their source of income. <br />
<br />
Since there is no gating top guilds literally have to fight for world first kills just to stay on top, its pretty brutal.<br />

Blizzard has made 10 and 25 basically the same, except for amount of people, 10's might be easier in better coordination and easier to put together, but harder because if just one person dies you are pretty screwed. People need to start excepting 10's and 25's to be the same for World first kills and the like.</div></div><hr />

Instant LFD ports gets dungeons running faster, because people might be on a time constraint and they want to get into a dungeon.

It's unfortunate that Paragon's kill of Sinestra was an unfinished version (missing the Twilight Flames) and that Paragon's kill of Nefarian had a literally fight-breaking bug in it (Feral Druid's Rip stacking), but I don't blame Paragon for either of those (mainly the first).<br />
<br />
Also, Method's kill of Al'Akir was post-nerf, and Paragon's kill of Al'Akir was pre-nerf (and only very barely pre-nerf).<br />

<br />
My two 85s have bought everything with JP already. I almost have the heroic achievement drakes, and I consider myself somewhat casual. The more hardcore already have some valor gear.<br />
<br />
If you remove enough incentive to run heroics, then those people will quit doing heroics, and then the queue times will never get better or maybe even get worse.<br />
<br />
I don't see a problem with heroics being a source of gold. The daily random gives you 83g and they usually take an hour or longer. You get more gold than that doing a hours worth of dailies. Both activities require some attention and effort. It is not as if people are making gold hand-over-fist doing heroics.<br />
<br />
I'm not upset with the change to classic gem prices, but I do find it funny that people whine, &quot;These new JP dumps suck compared to older rewards&quot; and then Blizzard says, &quot;fine! we'll just make the older rewards worse then!&quot;<br />
<br />
There is ALWAYS incentive to run the daily random heroic. Even if you raid 25 mans and do complete clears of every boss you still are not getting weekly valor cap without doing 2 heroics per week. Since nobody except one or two guilds is clearing all the content every week, the áverage´raider isn´t getting anywhere near the cap every week.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rogerbrown</div><div class="date">2011-01-30, 01:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So many people have misinterpreted our post so I would like to clear it up a bit.<br />
<br />
Blizzard said that the top guild's raids are being closely observed by them to see if their encounters are working as intended.<br />
The last 5 bosses of this tier content got changed/hotfixed after they had been killed for the first time.<br />
<br />
The contradiction of the two facts above is what causes the confusion. It looks as if Blizzard doesn't care that much about the actual race for the World First kills and is rather just trying to fix the bosses for the masses that follow the top 3-5guilds.<br />
It is literally a different boss, the one you fight now with the one that was killed the first time. And this is easily understandable because the tactics that you see in the World First kill movies are not viable anymore due to changes/hotfixes.<br />
<br />
I personally have spoken with a couple of Paragon players and we all agreed that this situation was harmful for both guilds.<br />
It doesn't do Paragon justice changing the encounter after it has been defeated. Because Paragon would certainly be able to achieve the same world rankings even if they had the hotfixed versions of the fights from the beginning. And trying to deprive them of their accomplishments is just nonsense.(shoo trolls)<br />
It also made our life harder since we had to do some fights the hard way, taking more time and expanding the gap between the kills with an unrealistic difference in guild level.<br />
<br />
So it was a lose-lose for the both of us. Hopefully people understand that now.<br />
<br />
What we are basically saying is: Blizzard, pay more attention and react much faster on each and every boss that is being killed for the first time if you see that the mechanics are not what you wanted them to be.<br />
<br />
<br />
About the other couple of things being discussed here...<br />
<br />
What we, and every other top guild, experienced at this content was way too massive (way too long grind to kill all the bosses). And even tho we appreciate that there wasn't any pushover boss (icc lootship), in fact almost all the bosses are relatively hard, we don't want the progress to take as long as it did this time. So what we are saying is, reduce the amount of bosses. And we felt that even gating was better than what we had this time. Obviously the best would be just a reduction of the bosses to 8-9 instead of 13 imo, but if blizzard wants to release the same amount of bosses as they did this time and they want to make them all as hard as they were this time, then yes it should be done in a more civil form of gating indeed.<br />
<br />
Now about the subject that if we wanted, we could have just taken some days off raiding.<br />
When you are aiming for world firsts, and you know that your direct competition is raiding every day, you can't expect to take a few days off and still be competing for World Firsts. And mind you we took some days off during christmas and on new year's eve-1st jan.<br />
Lastly... about the SS<br />
I am quite disappointed that there are people trying to find some secret meaning behind it when its just supposed to be funny. Trying to see things when there is nothing is just...<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyways, I hope this cleared things up<br />

Like anything give it a few months and people forget about it. Blizzard needs to do this more and stop caving in. People end up stop whining as time goes on.<br />
<br />
The reason people stopped caring is because 2 weeks later, cata came out, and hey we didn't need dalaran anymore or its ports, people were up in arms about it mainly over it being&quot;Hey blizz, what gives we still need to be in northrend to get our shit done and you took away our only convient way of getting out of here so now we must tip a mage 20g to get out&quot;<br />
<br />
Now of course you could leave northrend by means of a 10 minute flight and a boat.<br />

<br />
Except that I've bought every piece of valor gear that interests me. All that remains are the BoE boots and I'll get enough valor from raiding that it's not worth the aggravation to run the daily H just to get incrementally closer to them. Further, the valor only comes from the first run of the day, but there is pressure to run more than that to help gear guildmates...there is rather a dearth of tanks but quite a few dps that rotate in and out of the primary raid comp.<br />
<br />
And while Blizzard has increased the JP gain from the individual bosses, they've upped the time investment as well. Gone are the &quot;pringles chip&quot; dungeons of Wrath, where a 20 minute run was almost unheard of regardless of the skill level of the players. Now 25 minutes is record time. Most times a run takes 40 minutes to as much as two hours depending on the level of competence of the group, nor does the tank and healer have the ability to carry scrub DPS the way they could in Wrath.<br />
<br />
Please don't get me wrong...I'm not crying about the dungeons themselves. I enjoyed the first weeks of cata dungeons. I enjoyed gearing up. I enjoyed learning new fights, I enjoyed mechanics that were on par with some wrath raids. I enjoyed the whole experience.<br />
<br />
But lets face it...the content has grown stale. There's far less impetus to go back to the dungeons once your toon is raid ready. There's even less when your toon has finished getting valor gear. While there's variety in raids, there's less variety in the dungeons themselves; nine heroics to wrath's ten, with two being rehashed old content.<br />
<br />
One reason why the LFD queues are as long as they are is due to the rate of return being less than it was in wrath, with blizz showing that they intend to make it even more so. The solid, experienced players are getting geared up and geared out, and simply not running as much. These are the experienced hands that help teach the newer players, if nothing else than by example. Not everyone is an altoholic. Personally, I have no intentions of bringing up a second toon to heroics until 359 gear is available via justice.<br />
<br />
My own thought is that 346 gear should NEVER have required Chaos orbs, let alone three. My own thought is that there be another orb, bound or unbound, that drops from the final bosses in regular Grim Batol, HoO, and Tol'Vir, and can be purchased for justice points. Add a couple more guns (especially a tank gun and/or dual spec STR gun) to the engineers, and some 346 armor pieces to the other professions (for example bracers, which can be very hard to get).<br />

Grats again Method on your 2ND kill, and Paragon on your 1ST kill.<br />

And on Method's comment, for all the people that are trying to decipher it, they were both complimenting and trying to hint to Blizzard to test their content more. But there are some bugs that are just unforeseeable, if you can't face that, then stop playing, it's pathetic, they make the game for your enjoyment, if you don't enjoy it when there is a bug or two, quit.

Method is mad that they got no world first kills during this tier. Atramedes was exploited (out of the room) and Magmaw adds were kited to Defense System room and back.<br />

What is the advantage between those skeleton kited in the room or out of the room other than having more room? Magmaw can and will still spill lava and shadow things on the kiter and skeletons still leave fire patchs anyway.</div></div><hr />

OKAY, then why are there still instant dungeon teleports? When at start of wrath we needed Summoning Stones at the entrance, those have been useless forever and still remain. Yet we cant have portals back? That may not relate to the two things I just mentioned, but thats my take on it... They remove 1 thing but keep instant LFD teleports. IDK maybe im just QQing<br />
<br />
Did you really read what they said about portals at all? You are just QQing. They put the portals in to begin with so people in Outlands (and later in Northrend) could easily reach auction houses and class trainers. They specifically kept auction houses and class trainers in the original major cities so that they wouldn't become ghost towns once people got to content that wasn't on the original two continents. Now that Cata is out and most of the new content is on either EK or Kal, people are spending most of their time in Org or SW and there is no risk of them becoming ghost towns at this point. The whole point of the portals to begin with was so that the original content places wouldn't become ghost towns after BC and Cata came out. And now there are class trainers and auction houses in both Shatt and Dal, so the people who are leveling through BC and Wrath content don't need to come back to SW or Org to train and access the auction house. There is no real point to the portals anymore. It has nothing to do with them not wanting us to &quot;zip around quickly around the world.&quot; You can still move quickly around the world if you're trying to get to Cata zones. There are portals to those places. Your hearth stone only has a 15 minute cooldown (if you're guild has the perk). There are a lot of other tools now that can be used in place of a hearth stone (like archaeology rares, guild rewards, etc). I don't even notice the lack of portals in Dal. But then again, I don't see any reason to go to Dal. And if I do, I can almost always find a guildie who is really to come port me there and then I can just hearth back to SW.<br />
<br />
The point of teleporting into dungeons via the LFD tool and summoning stones serve a completely different purpose than portals ever did. Those are meant to be used so that we don't have to wait ages for people to fly/port/whatever to get to dungeons and raids. I guarantee you that if people had to wait for 25 people to fly/run/swim/etc to get to a raid entrance there would be a lot less people raiding.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Haha, nice way to nerf vendoring TBC gems as viable way to dump JP :P<br />
<br />
I never would have thought to do this.<br />
<br />
Also some people already have 5000 valor tokens, wtf? Valor is a pain unless you raid (I don't have time), I don't want to run heroics all day, especially when some of them take like over an hour to do.<br />

<br />
It's not about QQing, it's about being consistent.<br />
<br />
I understand that they don't want people hanging around in those zones, but what about new characters that need to get to outlands or northrend? Sure, I use my AT tabard to easily get to Northrend and if I wanted to spend 6800g i'd get the kirin tor ring. Sure, there's not much to do in those zones, but for those of us (me) that are still doing AT for the rewards, or going there to do the dailies for fishing/cooking hoping that those last recipies would drop, it's now tedious instead of useful.<br />
<br />
Here, if they're going to make it hard for you to go to the old zones, at least put some incentive to stay in the reworked ones. What do I have left to do in Azeroth?<br />
<br />
-Hyjal for Loremaster of Cata<br />
-TB for the spectral wolf and maybe a tabard and pet (already have the drake)<br />
-Kalimdor and EK for Loremaster<br />
-Arch grinding<br />
-some vanilla raiding rep, maybe try for the legendaries, meh<br />
<br />
That's it. Put the recipies back in the fishing dailies, (you know, for chef title and such) give me more things to do here instead. What do I have left in the rest of the world?<br />
<br />
Northrend:<br />
-finish frenzy heart for the two achievements<br />
-get some bros to ICC a bit for the title I guess from honored<br />
-get some drakes from uld and icc maybe<br />
-try and get the drake from sarth and maybe the sarth10 title<br />
-maybe try and get that stupid fucking ring<br />
-finish nerubian arch. I got the vryukul axe as my second solve so that's pretty much over with.<br />
<br />
outlands:<br />
-I only have 4 reps to exalted here (maghar, spore, netherwing, skyguard) so the rest of those (oh my god do not remind me about ogrila)<br />
-netherstorm for loremaster of outlands<br />
-crawdaddy fishing crap<br />
-some dungeons and raids<br />
-finish draenei arch. I got the orc helm as the first solve so that's mostly over with.<br />
<br />
after that it's just pvp and seasonal achievements for the violet drake (I took a break for a year, and started during wrath). I guess I could go for bloodsail or the exalted or insane, but that's way too much work.<br />
<br />
Other than that, I've been playing alts now because I've gotten bored of Retribution.</div></div><hr />

Even if you're buying them to cut you could get far more gold per JP if you bought the ilvl 213 epic BoE bracers from the old valor point vendor in Dalaran. Each bracer costs about 350 points and could probably sell for 300-700g depending on your server, hell maybe even more. People as a whole have more gold now then ever before and when I bought 3 of those bracers the other day to get rid of some JP I just stuck them on the AH for 500g each to see if there was any interest and all 3 sold within the day.<br />
<br />
500g (on average) for 350 JP vs maybe 30g for 220 JP. Even when they bring in the new cata mat vendor, it would still be a better idea to buy those bracers, sell them, and use the money to buy whatever cata mat you want.<br />
<br />
Except that stats on these bracers are worse than first ilevel 272 quest rewards. You need to find an extremely stupid buyer to sell these for 300g+.</div></div><hr />

It's a question of keeping it controlled. In terms of manpower, it means that defenders need to maintain only half the personnel of the attacking force at a given keep to maintain their grip on it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Defenders get all 3 when the game starts, but that make little difference. The out numbered defender will obiously get killed faster than the attacker and you need to be alive to gain capture points. The base would probably turn grey and lose the advantage before defender's reinforcements arrived, as the defender no longer host half the number of men against the attacker on that base.</div></div><hr />

If your faction cant get 25 to join and actively play on offense (thanks for nuking the gatherer nodes), no buff is going to help change the outcome.<br />
<br />
Assuming relatively even numbers are playing, the only advantage for the attacker is that it takes longer for a defender to return to a keep when they die. The new buff will make it a little easier to zerg the defenders and take control before they can return en-masse. Even if the defenders switch keeps, they still might not make it in time to beat the sped up control bar.<br />
<br />
If the defenders split up on main defense and try to hold 2 keeps instead to prevent the attacker's buff, they still have the travel disadvantage and will be a little more vulnerable to zergs. <br />

I'm still not sure any of this is enough to dislodge the defender on a regular basis. Balanced would having the faction cap start at 10 vs. 25, eliminating the rez spawn distance for defenders, and having the winning condition be offense getting 2 keeps out of 3. Give it your best shot, pile up at two keeps and may the better geared/playing side win.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Balance&quot; is a relative thing. Blizz made it clear that they wanted to make an incentive to actually show up and defend. The only way to do this that doesn't result in win trading is to make the recapture process painful. They've admitted that currently capping TB is more painful than they intended and the change will definitely increase the successful attack rates in Tol Barad. They'll also award coordination and intelligent play on both sides. They won't, however, make the zone constantly traded and hopefully won't leave the holding faction feeling that defending is a waste of time, which is what Blizzard saw on many servers with Wintergrasp and what they wanted to move away from in Cataclysm.<br />
<br />
And to be fair, defense is always easier than offence. Sieges are much more painful for the attacker than for the defender.<br />
<br />
Personally, I like the cutoff point for faction numbers balance where it is. The way I see it, if a faction population cannot muster a bare 25 people to defend, they deserve to be outnumbered.</div></div><hr />

Fishing<br />
Rare fishing poles now have a chance to be found in the Bag of Fishing Treasures earned via the Stormwind and Orgrimmar Fishing daily quests.<br />
<br />
About damn time!<br />
<br />
Not really, in my opinion this is a very disappointing update, recycled rewards yet again :(<br />
<br />
The current lot of fishing dailys are just plain awful.<br />
<br />
Once you've completed the achievement, leveled your fishing to 525 there's absolutely no incentive to continue doing them (*)<br />
Why ? Well apart from the low gold payout the biggest disincentive are the rewards from the Bag of Shiny Things:<br />
<br />
Weather Beaten Fishing Hat, been around since Burning Crusade patch 2.4.0. 25th March 2008<br />
Strand Crawler Pet, been around since Wrath of the Lich King patch 3.1.0. 14th April 2009<br />
<br />
That's it. Two recycled rewards from the past two expansions. All the other drops from the bag are low value vendor trash.<br />
<br />
Look at the BC fishing rewards: 4 pets, 2 Ring, Blue Gem, Fishing Line, Recipe, Hat.<br />
WotLK: Pet, Rods, 2 Quest Starters, 5 Ring, High Value Vendor Trash, Epic Gems, (BC Hat, recipe and Fishing Line), Tiny Titanium Lockbox<br />
<br />
My suggestion is to upgrade the rewards to Cataclysm standard, after all its a new expansion, so how about some new rewards ? <br />
Give some reason to go back and do them.<br />
<br />
(*) One minor incentive, it does pay out 40 guild rep.</div></div><hr />
