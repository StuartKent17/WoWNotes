Blizzard Gear Store Addition - Cute But Deadly Vinyls<br />
Blizzard added some new Vinyls to the Blizzard Gear store (http://gear.blizzard.com/index.php/default/cute-but-deadly-blind-vinyl.html/) recently and we have a full set to look at!<br />

Yeah. They said that basically they wanted most specs to start with a basic &quot;rotation&quot; and you get upward of 5-7 more buttons from talent choices. They can't simplify without removing a few buttons and there's little point in simply throwing away spells that everyone already knows.<br />
<br />
This isn't like WoD in which they said &quot;we're pruning&quot; and then did squat to almost any spec aside from Blood. This is a case of them literally pulling buttons to an optional tab so a spec can actually vary heavily from player to player.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ahuh. The classes and trees are more systemically and thematically different than ever before and people spout this crap. We get weapons which we can change ourselves (beyond just stats but with actual functions and talent tree level stuff as we level it up) through talent trees and cosmetics and people spout this crap.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;So now you don't even need to change weapons&quot; - How is getting a new weapon and exchanging it with your old one (granted that it is better) any difficult? Artifact Weapons is one of the best decisions they have made in a long time. Along with taking a hard look at all specs to see what was redundant, and how they could add new interesting things. Talents that more often than not have no clear winner.<br />
<br />
Legion is, from what we know and have seen so far, going to be one of the best expansions ever.</div></div><hr />

<br />
While they may just have removed spells and made them talents, it still offers more interesting choices than passive talents that just give you a x% chance to reset y spell etc.<br />

<br />
Agreed usually in PvE the way to go is passives so i will mostly go passive anyway. Biggest concern for me is the shaman talents, we already have millions cds to press now we are given even more on every row. Altough im not sure wich spells they have removed. But i still see a cd based class :/</div></div><hr />

I can't speak for all classes, of course. But for pal and rogue, the choices look interesting (until someone maths everything out of course).<br />
I'm not too keen on the &quot;let's force holy pals into melee&quot; talents, however, hopefully it won't be mandatory. :(</div></div><hr />

I kind of get the idea of getting away from &quot;theme&quot; rows or whatever they called it, but this is flat out stupid. Hell in each spec of my class I'm seeing anywhere from 2-4 talents that used to be glyphs... really Blizz.... really???</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Archibalde</div><div class="date">2015-11-22, 05:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The talents definitely seem pretty random at the moment. Usually they want to avoid cookie-cutter builds, but some of the talent tiers seem to only have one obvious choice. For an Arcane Mage, level 75 offers a damaging spell and 2 crowd control ones. It's a rather strange pairing. Unless they're removing the damage from Supernova (which would be unfortunate), any PvE player will always go for it over Ring of Frost or 2 charges of Frost Nova.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JemiS</div><div class="date">2015-11-22, 05:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">They said that was intentional (1 damage, 2 CC). <br />
<br />
The idea is that there isn't one &quot;CC&quot; row, and one &quot;damage&quot; row, but rather PvE players have a damage choice on every row and PvP players have a CC choice on every row. <br />
<br />
<br />
IE, there's some actual thought into what you take for what purpose.</div></div><hr />

Most likely do less dps than active button pressing. I'm going to guess at least 5% less dps and a lot less burst (PvP).</div></div><hr />

It's nice they moved the mandatory glyphs into the talents itself, but It's not quite there yet. Also I get the feeling some jobs become more obsolete than others.<br />
<br />
I wish they would bring back the old talent trees and combine them with the active skills to make a seperated passive and active tree. On one tree you chose your most liked active mash buttons, on the other you have a small way to customize your char, something that gets lost more and more over the last expansions. In WOTLK I played my DK Tank as avoid and not HP - and was quite satisfied with it.<br />
<br />
Sure, there is the &quot;danger&quot; of some ppl running to a guide and copying the needed talents one to one, but it would greatly improve your binding (and fun) to your char. Also you could have way more things to enjoy while leveling up. 6 active talent choices every 20 lvlup or something like that is boring. But every 3-5 lvlup 1 passive point and sometimes an active would be nice. Would also work greatly with the fantasy thing they are trying to do.<br />
<br />
Like as a tank ... Avoid(the old)/Absorb vs. Stamina (1% bonus each point), each 3/3 Points, so full avoid, full hp, 2 avoid and 1 hp OR all to 3 and keep some points for/from the levels above them. It wouldn't be game breaking, but it would be something that can make you and your char a bit more like a unique snowflake. Without hurting the game itself</div></div><hr />

<br />
You liked it better because it was a clearly superior option (avoid vs stam) in that xpac. Dont confuse the illusion of choice with actual customization.</div></div><hr />

Blizz makes up the difference between Sell - Buy price and when the difference is very wide it stimulates sales. Blizzard controls the pricing algorithm. You can note the change in delta when they switch pricing algorithms. They switch to the high delta algorithm periodically to stimulate sales.</div></div><hr />

I'm pretty sure they've said that Mages are one of the least changed classes this time around. The class fantasy is already there, just need to tweak the numbers as usual.</div></div><hr />

Don't worry just yet. There are also no changes to Balance talents, despite the spec getting overhauled in Legion. These are definitely not complete.</div></div><hr />

RoP is horrible. Why are they on the one hand designing more and more movement-heavy fights, but on the other hand force us to stand still in one or two spots? What's wrong with their heads?</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;Totemic Fury&quot; (lvl 100 elemental talent): one of the effects: decreases lightning bolt cast time by 50%.<br />
&quot;Lightning Bolt&quot; (base ability): 30 yd range, INSTANT, Fires a bolt of lightning [...]&quot;<br />
<br />
So is lightning bolt really instant, or is that an error? This is MASSIVELY important for elemental shamans, as most of us surely loved the mobility of the on-the-move lightning bolt. In fact, if lightning bolt becomes instant, I will considering switching back to elemental.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So...they force you to maximize the efficiency of your movement so you avoid mechanics while staying in your RoP to maintain max DPS as much as possible.<br />
<br />
They gave mages something skillful to have to do (for the first time ever, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2 sure is fucking hard) and you immediately cry and shit your pants with rage.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They're heads are right on target for balancing. Every dps should have to work hard for the best damage to differentiate between crappy and skilled players.<br />

Can we run around with our PVP talents or is that only active in BG's? Becuase I love the Ret PVP talents. HoR &gt;HoW really.<br />
<br />
Supposed to activate in world pvp as well, like the damage reduction and battle fatigue kick in now. Same tech, just expanded. Doubt you'd have a way to use them in pure pve though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So I use the first one, at 8 seconds I use the second one, at 16 seconds I use the first recharge, at 24 seconds I use the next recharge, at 32 seconds the effects end, at 36 seconds I can use a recharge and from there forward I have 8 seconds up, 4 seconds down. That's assuming I can time every cast perfectly, have no conflicts with other GCDs, and that it makes sense to cast it every time a charge is available. Where is this snowball you speak of?</div></div><hr />
