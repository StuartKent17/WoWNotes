<br />
Secondary Stat Attunements<br />
A new concept that we’re introducing is each specialization having an attunement to a particular secondary stat. These take the form of a passive ability that grants a 5% increase to the amount of a specific secondary stat gained. This provides a good starting point for where to focus your secondary stats. Usually, it will be your highest throughput stat (not counting Spirit for Healers, and Bonus Armor for Tanks, which is an optimal secondary stat in most cases). There are exceptions, and raw throughput may not even be the biggest concern in some situations. Treat this as a guideline, not a rule, about which secondary stat to favor.<br />
<br />
<br />
New passive abilities granting a 5% bonus to specific secondary stat bonuses received from equipped items have been added for all specializations.<br />

Active Mana Regeneration (Section Removed)<br />
Another part of the changes to healing is providing a way for them to better manage their mana. There are ways to spend more mana for more healing but we’re also adding methods for healers to trade extra time, healing, or more mana to use later in a fight when they really need it.<br />
<br />
Druid<br />
<br />
Innervate has been redesigned to now have a 2-second cast time with no cooldown, and restore 2.5% of the Druid's maximum mana every 4 seconds for 8 seconds. Spending any mana on a healing spell will cancel this effect.<br />
<br />
<br />
Monk<br />
<br />
Crackling Jade Lightning's channel duration has been reduced to 4 seconds.<br />
Stance of the Wise Serpent now also causes Crackling Jade Lightning to cost no mana, and restore 2% of the Monk’s maximum mana if the ability is channeled for its full duration.<br />
<br />
<br />
Paladin<br />
<br />
Divine Plea has been redesigned to be instant cast ability with no cooldown, and consume 3 Holy Power to immediately regain 7% of the Paladin's maximum mana.<br />
<br />
<br />
Priest<br />
<br />
Atonement is no longer triggered by Penance.<br />
Chakra: Chastise in addition to existing effects, now also causes Smite and Holy Fire to restore 0.75% of the Priest's maximum mana each time they are cast instead of costing mana.<br />
Penance now also refunds 1.1% of the Priest’s maximum mana each time it deals damage.<br />
<br />
<br />
Shaman<br />
<br />
Telluric Currents is now a passive ability for Restoration Shaman and causes Lightning Bolt to restore 1.25% of the Shaman's maximum mana each time it is cast instead of costing mana.<br />
Glyph of Telluric Currents has been removed.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Ability Pruning<br />
We attempt to prune abilities with the intent to reduce the amount of keybind/macro bloat and merging abilities that served a similar purpose but are otherwise redundant together.<br />

<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
Buffs and Debuffs<br />
All specializations provide some common buffs and debuffs. These are important to the game because they encourage cooperation, make you stronger when you work together with others, and promote Raid composition diversity. However, we saw room to revise these buffs and debuffs. In addition to the above changes, we revised which buffs and debuffs are provided by Hunter pets. Please see the Hunter Pet Abilities section for a full list of changes.<br />
<br />
Two new stats have been added that benefitted all players. Also added were three new debuffs (Weakened Armor, Physical Vulnerability, and Magic Vulnerability) that each benefitted only half of the group. While that could be interesting, the two physical debuffs were redundant, and felt that the two new stats would be better suited as raid buffs. So, we made that replacement.<br />
<br />
<br />
Weakened Armor, Physical Vulnerability, and Magic Vulnerability<br />
<br />
Physical Vulnerability increases physical damage taken by 5% (up from 4%).<br />
The following abilities no longer apply the Weakened Armor effect.<br />
Death Knight (Frost): Brittle Bones has been removed.<br />
Death Knight (Unholy): Ebon Plaguebringer no longer causes Physical Vulnerability.<br />
Druid: Faerie Fire longer applies Weakened Armor. now applies Physical Vulnerability, increasing Physical damage taken by 5% for 30 seconds.<br />
Hunter Pets: Tallstrider: Dust Cloud, Raptor: Tear Armor (See the Hunter Pet Abilities section.)<br />
Paladin (Retribution): Judgments of the Bold no longer causes Physical Vulnerability.<br />
Rogue: Expose Armor no longer applies Weakened Armor.<br />
Rogue: Master Poisoner has been removed.<br />
Warlock: Curse of the Elements has been removed.<br />
Warrior: Sunder Armor no longer applies Weakened Armor.<br />
Warrior (Arms, Fury): Colossus Smash no longer causes Physical Vulnerability.<br />
Warrior (Protection): Devastate no longer applies Weakened Armor.<br />
<br />
<br />
Versatility<br />
<br />
Death Knight (Frost, Unholy): Unholy Aura now also provides 3% Versatility.<br />
Druid: Mark of the Wild now also provides 3% Versatility.<br />
Paladin (Retribution): Sanctity Aura is a new passive ability for Retribution Paladins which grants 3% Versatility to the Paladin and all allies within 100 yards.<br />
Warrior (Arms, Fury): Inspiring Presence is a new passive ability for Arms and Fury Warriors which grants 3% Versatility to the Warrior and all allies within 100 yards.<br />
<br />
<br />
Multistrike<br />
<br />
Monk (Windwalker): Windflurry is a new passive ability for Windwalker Monks which grants 5% Multistrike to the Monk and all allies within 100 yards.<br />
Priest (Shadow): Mind Quickening now also grants 5% Multistrike.<br />
Rogue: Swiftblade’s Cunning now also grants 5% Multistrike.<br />
Warlock: Dark Intent now grants 5% Multistrike instead of 10% Stamina.<br />
<br />
Blood Pact is a new passive ability for Warlocks which grants 10% Stamina to the Monk and all allies within 10 yards.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Weakened Blows was a debuff that mattered almost exclusively to tanks, and that every tank automatically applied. We removed the debuff and reduced creature damage to compensate.<br />
<br />
The following abilities have been removed.<br />
<br />
Hunter Pets, Bear: Demoralizing Roar; Carrion Bird: Demoralizing Screech (See the Hunter Pet Abilities section.)<br />
<br />
<br />
The Cast Speed Slow was a debuff type that mattered almost exclusively to PvP, and made combat much less fun for casters in addition to encouraging the use of instant-cast spells. We decided that it was best to remove casting speed debuffs. <br />
<br />
The following abilities have been removed.<br />
<br />
Hunter Pets, Core Hound: Lava Breath; Fox: Tailspin; Goat: Trample; Sporebat: Spore Cloud (See the Hunter Pet Abilities section.)<br />
<br />
<br />
As part of a push to combine the different types of Haste in the game as much as possible, we merged Spell Haste and Attack Speed into just Haste, which benefits everyone.<br />
<br />
<br />
Spell Haste and Attack Speed<br />
<br />
The following abilities now provide a 5% increase to melee, ranged, and spell Haste to all Party and Raid members (previously they only increased spell Haste).<br />
<br />
Druid (Balance): Moonkin Form<br />
Hunter Pet (Sporebat): Energizing Spores (See the Hunter Pet Abilities section.)<br />
<br />
<br />
The following Hunter pet abilities have been removed.<br />
<br />
Hyena: Cackling Howl; Serpent: Serpent's Swiftness (See the Hunter Pet Abilities section.)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Some classes received new abilities to provide some of harder-to-find buffs/debuffs, increasing their utility to the Party or Raid.<br />
<br />
Other <br />
<br />
The following abilities now also increase magic damage taken by the target by 5% for 15 seconds.<br />
<br />
Monk (Windwalker): Rising Sun Kick<br />
Priest (Shadow): Mind Blast<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Instant Cast Heals<br />
Over time, healers have gained a bigger and bigger arsenal of heals that they can cast while on the move, which removes the inherent cost that movement is intended to have for them, while also limiting players’ ability to counter healing in PvP. This left Silences and crowd control (which we’re trying to curb) as the only ways to actually limit an enemy player's healing output. We're still preserving the option to instantly heal, but are reducing the number of instant-cast healing abilities overall. Raid and dungeon encounter damage during high-movement phases will be adjusted accordingly. Here are some examples:<br />
<br />
Priest<br />
<br />
Divine Star now has a 1.5-second cast time (up from instant cast), but can be cast while moving.<br />
<br />
<br />
Tank Vengeance and Resolve<br />
Then, to keep tank DPS meaningful, we'll be raising their damage, since it would be meager with no Vengeance Attack Power (Vengeance accounted for 70-90% of a tank's damage on high-tank-damage fights in Mists). To do that, we're increasing the damage of several prominent tank abilities, as well as having tanks also gain increased Attack Power from Mastery and Bonus Armor, in addition to the stat’s existing benefits. For plate-wearing Tank specializations, Riposte has been redesigned to convert Critical Strike into Parry, a defensive stat. That also helps keep secondary stats balanced in offensive value for them.<br />
<br />
General<br />
<br />
Bladed Armor is a new passive ability for Blood Death Knights, Guardian Druids, Brewmaster Monks, Protection Paladins, and Protection Warriors.<br />
<br />
Bladed Armor increases Attack Power by 100% of the character's Bonus Armor.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Tooltip Clarity<br />
Being able to quickly understand what an ability does by glancing at the tooltip is of paramount importance to learn how to play with a given class or specialization. We’ve taken an extensive look at the tooltips for all class abilities, and revised them to be as clear and concise as possible.<br />
<br />
In some rare cases, we’ve removed mention of niche information that we don’t think is needed. If that's the case, please note that a change to the ability's tooltip does not mean that functionality has changed. If the change in question is not mentioned in the Patch Notes, there has been no change to the ability.<br />
<br />
Tooltips for nearly all class abilities have been revised for increased clarity.<br />
<br />
<br />
Self-Sustainability<br />
Another area of gameplay that we polished is how characters are able to sustain their own health, primarily when frequently killing enemies, such as in solo questing.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ideathknights.gif Death Knight<br />
<br />
Dark Succor is now a passive ability learned by all Death Knights at level 60 (instead of being a glyph).<br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/idruids.gif Druid <br />
<br />
Healing Touch now heals for 50% more when cast on self for Balance Druids.<br />
Predatory Swiftness now also increases the healing done by Healing Touch by 50%.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ihunters.gif Hunter<br />
<br />
Kill Shot now heals the Hunter for 15% of maximum health if it kills the target.<br />
Survivalist is a new passive ability learned by Survival Hunters at level 10:<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/imonks.gif Monk<br />
<br />
Afterlife now always summons a Healing Sphere when an enemy is killed.<br />
Glyph of Afterlife has been removed.<br />

<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ideathknights.gif Death Knight <br />
<br />
Rune Tap now grants an absorption shield equal to 30% of your missing health. It also now has 2 charges, with a 30-second recharge time.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/idruids.gif Druid<br />
The loss of Symbiosis (see Ability Pruning above) will primarily impact druids’ survival, as many of the abilities received through Symbiosis were defensive cooldowns. To compensate for that change, and for the removal of Barkskin for non-Guardian Druids, we buffed Survival Instincts significantly and the ability is now available for all specializations.<br />
<br />
Survival Instincts is now available to all Druid specializations. Survival Instincts now reduces damage taken by 70% (up from 50%) with a 2-minute cooldown (down from 3 minutes), and for Feral and Guardian specializations can have up to 2 charges (up from 1 charge).<br />
<br />
<br />
Guardian Changes<br />
<br />
Mangle now generates 30 Rage, and its cooldown is reduced by Haste.<br />
<br />
<br />
Feral Changes<br />
Feral Druids received one major change, and few tweaks beyond what's been mentioned above in Ability Pruning and Facing Requirements. Combo Points are now stored &quot;on the player&quot;, meaning that when you switch targets, any accumulated Combo Points remain with you. Pounce was buffed significantly, in order to bring it up to par with Ravage. Primal Fury was changed to let it affect area attacks as well. Critical strike chance of Ferocious Bite was changed in order to increase the value of Critical Strike. Glyph of Savage Roar was reworked to better achieve its intended effect.<br />
<br />
<br />
Mangle now generates 15 Rage (up from 5 Rage), and its cooldown is reduced by Haste.<br />
Pounce's damage has been increased by 100%.<br />
Ferocious Bite now has double the normal chance to critically strike against bleeding targets (instead of having an additional 25% chance to critically strike).<br />
<br />
<br />
Balance Rebalanced<br />
<br />
Balance Energy system has been redesigned. Balance Energy is a bar that cycles back and forth between Lunar and Solar sides, like night and day, with a 40 second cycle time (from Lunar to Solar and back to Lunar).<br />
Moonfire now has a base duration of 20 seconds (up from 14 seconds), but is no longer extended by Starfire and Starsurge critical strikes.<br />
Sunfire now has a base duration of 20 seconds (up from 14 seconds), but is no longer extended by Wrath and Starsurge critical strikes. Additionally, Sunfire is no longer its own spell. Sunfire replaces Moonfire on the action bar whenever Balance Energy is on the Solar side. Enemies may still suffer from both Moonfire and Sunfire’s periodic damage components simultaneously.<br />
Shooting Stars now adds 1 full charge of Starsurge and Starfall when it triggers, and now has a 5% chance to trigger when the most recent Moonfire or and Sunfire deals periodic damage. This chance is doubled on critical strikes.<br />
Celestial Alignment has been redesigned.<br />
<br />
Celestial Alignment causes the Druid to enter Celestial Alignment, a state where Balance Energy cycle is paused, all damage done is increased by 20%, and all Lunar and Solar spells benefit from the maximum Eclipse bonus. While in Celestial Alignment, Moonfire and Sunfire will also apply the other spell’s periodic damage effect. Lasts 15 seconds with a 3 minute cooldown.<br />
<br />
Euphoria has been removed. A new level-100 talent with the same name has been added.<br />
Equinox has been replaced with a new talent, Balance of Power.<br />
<br />
Balance of Power causes Wrath to extend the duration of Sunfire by 4 seconds and Starfire to extend the duration of Moonfire by 6 seconds.<br />
<br />
Sunfall has been replaced with a new talent, Euphoria.<br />
<br />
Euphoria grants the Druid a deeper connection to the stars, causing Balance Energy to cycle 50% faster. Additionally, Lunar and Solar Empowerments also reduce the cast time of affected spells by 20%.<br />
<br />
Several Glyphs and Draenor Perks will be redesigned in a future build, and so are currently TBD.<br />
<br />
Glyph of Omens<br />
Glyph of Sudden Eclipse<br />
Empowered Starfall<br />
Enhanced Mushrooms<br />
Enhanced Starsurge<br />
Enhanced Storms<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Restoration Changes<br />
Genesis and Wild Mushroom: Bloom fill a similar need for burst healing, so Wild Mushroom: Bloom has been removed, leaving Wild Mushroom to focus on the Efflorescence effect.<br />
<br />
<br />
Genesis has been redesigned.<br />
<br />
Genesis now consumes all of the Druid's Rejuvenation effects on party or raid members within 60 yards and applies the Genesis effect to them instead. Genesis heals the target for an amount equal to the remaining healing from the consumed Rejuvenation effects over 3 seconds. Healing from Genesis counts toward Wild Mushroom as if it was from Rejuvenation.<br />
<br />
Wild Mushroom (Restoration) now has a 30-second cooldown, lasts for 30 seconds, provides periodic healing to nearby allies, and no longer collects Rejuvenation overhealing.<br />
<br />
Wild Mushroom: Bloom has been removed.<br />
Swiftmend no longer causes Efflorescence.<br />
<br />
Swiftmend no longer causes Efflorescence. Instead, Wild Mushroom (Restoration) now causes Efflorescence to appear at the mushroom’s location.<br />
<br />
<br />
And the Druid changes are capped off by merging Glyph of Stampede's effects into Glyph of Stampeding Roar.<br />
<br />
Glyph of Stampede has been removed. Its effects have been merged into Glyph of Stampeding Roar.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ihunters.gif Hunter<br />
<br />
Burst Damage Cooldowns<br />
Each specialization received a revision to the burst-damage-cooldowns that they have access to. All specializations now have one burst-damage-cooldown available baseline, and can add to that through talent choices.<br />
<br />
Beast Mastery Hunters retain Bestial Wrath. Rapid Fire is a good fit for Marksmanship, and we improved it. Survival opts to focus on sustained damage without burst cooldowns. However, if the situation calls for a burst-damage-cooldown, there are a few available via talents. we wanted to both increase the prominence of their traps, and give them a new damage cooldown. So, a new trap called Bear Trap has been created to fit that role. Note that Bear Trap's base cooldown can be reduced by other passive abilities and perks, such that it has roughly a 2 minute-cooldown afterwards.<br />
<br />
<br />
Bear Trap is a new ability for Survival Hunters.<br />
<br />
<br />
Bear Trap places a trap with duration of 1 minute that immobilizes the first enemy that triggers it for 8 seconds and deals heavy bleed damage over 20 seconds. Damage from other sources may break the immobilization effect. The ability has a 4 minute cooldown.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Hunter Pet Abilities<br />
<br />
Increased Multistrike buff Magic Damage Taken debuff: Basilisk, Bat, Chimaera, Core Hound, Dragonhawk, Fox, Rhino, Wind Serpent<br />
Increased Versatility buff Physical Damage Taken debuff: Bird of Prey, Boar, Porcupine, Ravager, Rhino, Worm<br />
An ability that increases dodge chance of the pet by 30% for 10 seconds: Bat, Fox, Monkey<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/images.gif Mage <br />
Presence of Mind was extremely strong for instant CC, which we wanted to curtail. Rather than completely remove Presence of Mind or make it not affect CC abilities, we made it a base Arcane spell, where we don't expect that it will be a problem, since Arcane has less CC than the other Mage specs already. In its place, we've added a new talent, Evanesce. It may seem out of place on a movement-focused talent row at first. In practice, we expect that the similarity will bear out as Mages use it instead of moving away from avoidable damage.<br />
<br />
The right level-75 Talent slot is now filled by a new Talent that varies by specialization. <br />
<br />
Blast Wave: Cause an explosion of fiery force around the target enemy or ally, dealing Fire damage to all enemies within 8 yards, and dazing them, reducing their movement speed by 70% for 4 seconds. If the primary target is an enemy, they take 100% increased damage. Replaces Frost Nova. Instant cast ability with a 25-second cooldown and 2 charges.<br />
Ice Nova: Cause a whirl of icy wind around the target enemy or ally, dealing Frost damage to all enemies within 8 yards, and freezing them for 4 seconds. If the primary target is an enemy, they take 100% increased damage. Replaces Frost Nova. Instant cast ability with a 20-second cooldown and 2 charges.<br />
Supernova: Cause a pulse of Arcane energy around the target enemy or ally, dealing Arcane damage to all enemies within 8 yards, and knocking them into the air. If the primary target is an enemy, they take 100% increased damage. Replaces Frost Nova. Instant cast ability with a 25-second cooldown and 2 charges.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/imonks.gif Monk<br />
<br />
Mistweaver Changes<br />
<br />
Crackling Jade Lightning's throughput has been increased by 100%, but it no longer generates Chi for Mistweaver Monks. Additionally, it is free in Stance of the Wise Serpent.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ipaladins.gif Paladin<br />
<br />
Holy Changes<br />
We adjusted the critical strike chance of Holy Shock, to increase the value of Critical Strike for Holy Paladins.<br />
<br />
<br />
Holy Shock now has twice the normal chance to critically strike (instead of having an additional 25% chance to critically strike).<br />
<br />
<br />
Miscellaneous<br />
We also revised how Eternal Flame interacts with Holy Power, and allowed it to once again trigger Illuminated Healing. One big change for Retribution that isn't mentioned here is the removal of Inquisition (see Ability Pruning), which will have a notable effect on their rotation.<br />
<br />
<br />
Eternal Flame’s periodic healing effect has been changed. Its duration now scales with Holy Power, instead of its healing. Its effect at 3 Holy Power remains unchanged.<br />
Illuminated Healing can once again be triggered by Eternal Flame.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ipriests.gif Priest<br />
<br />
Level-90 Talents and Atonement<br />
To get back to a balanced place, we've reapplied the AoE caps to the level-90 Talents, making them consistent with all other AoE heals, and reduced their effectiveness across the board. We’ve compensated for this in the tuning of Priest baseline heals.<br />
<br />
Holy Changes<br />
<br />
Chakra: Chastise no longer grants a chance for Smite to reset Holy Word: Chastise’s cooldown.<br />
<br />
<br />
Shadow Changes<br />
The cooldown of Mind Blast has also been adjusted to make Haste more valuable for Shadow, and removes Haste breakpoints.<br />
<br />
Mind Blast’s cooldown is now reduced by haste, but its base cooldown is now 9 seconds (up from 8 seconds).<br />
<br />
<br />
Talent Revisions<br />
Several talents were split into different versions by specialization. We revised the effectiveness of some of these talents to better balance talent choices on their row. We also swapped the Level-15 and Level-60 talent rows so players are presented with core Priest themed abilities earlier in the leveling process.<br />
<br />
Divine Insight’s effects have been split based on specialization.<br />
From Darkness, Comes Light has been split into Surge of Light for Discipline and Holy, and Surge of Darkness for Shadow for Shadow.<br />
<br />
Surge of Darkness now has a maximum of 3 charges (up from 2).<br />
<br />
Power Infusion now grants 25% Haste (up from 20%), but no longer increases damage (down from 5%).<br />
<br />
<br />
Miscellaneous<br />
We removed the Mana generation from Shadowfiend, in order to simplify it to being a burst-damage-cooldown. <br />
<br />
<br />
Inner Focus: No longer provides immunity to Dispels, Interrupts, and Silences. This effect will be returning as a Major Glyph.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ishamans.gif Shaman<br />
<br />
Elemental and Enhancement Changes<br />
<br />
Earthquake damage has been increased by 36%.<br />
Frost Shock’s damage has been reduced by 50%.<br />
Magma Totem’s damage has been increased by 100%.<br />
Unleash Frost no longer deals direct damage, but now always snares the target by 70% (rather than only when the target is already snared by a Frost spell).<br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/iwarriors.gif Warrior <br />
<br />
Burst Damage Cooldowns<br />
<br />
Heroic Throw is now a high-threat ability, generating 300% extra threat, has a 6-second cooldown (down from 30 seconds), but now has a 15 yard minimum range.<br />
<br />
<br />
Haste for Warriors<br />
<br />
Sudden Death can no longer trigger from Opportunity Strikes.<br />
<br />
<br />
Talent Changes<br />
We adjusted the effects of a few talents in order to make them more competitive with the talents on their row.<br />
<br />
Bladestorm is now a level-90 Talent, swapping places with Stormbolt. <br />
<br />
Bladestorm no longer allows use of Shouts except Demoralizing Shout while active. It does still allow the use of Taunt, Enraged Regeneration, Shield Wall, and Last Stand.<br />
<br />
<br />
Dragon Roar’s damage is no longer reduced when hitting more than 1 target. <br />
Mass Spell Reflection’s cooldown has been reduced to 30 seconds, but it now replaces Spell Reflection.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Recent Bloody Coins Hotfixes<br />
When we were developing the Timeless Isle, we wanted to add some incentive for players to engage in world PvP independently of faction balance. To that end, we created the Censer of Eternal Agony and Bloody Coin mechanic. This created a “third faction” of sorts on the Isle, and brought an extra element of danger to players adventuring there. <br />
<br />
We’re happy with how that worked out when Patch 5.4 released, but as time has passed, the general atmosphere of the Timeless Isle has changed. The majority of players who venture there today are either gearing up alts, or chasing after rare drops. As a result, we feel that it’s time to let the sun set on the Censer of Eternal Agony, and have increased its cooldown to 1 hour. Players who want to use it for its original purpose still can, but it will be a much larger setback when they’re defeated in battle. <br />
<br />
That said, we still want players to be able to collect Bloody Coins (and the rewards that come with them), so we’re making some adjustments to the Fire-Watcher’s Oath item, which can now be purchased from Speaker Gulan for 100 Timeless Coins. The Fire-Watcher’s Oath allows the collection of Bloody Coins from PvP kills, doesn’t change your faction, and it can be used anywhere – including Battlegrounds. We’ve reduced its cooldown to 10 minutes (which matches its duration), removed the mounting restrictions, and have dramatically increased the ability to earn coins from PvP kills while it’s active. We want players interested in earning Bloody Coins to seek them out in a Battleground with use of the Fire-Watcher’s Oath. <br />
<br />
Overall, we feel that these changes will not only make the Timeless Isle more attractive to players interested in its rewards, but will also give players collecting Bloody Coins a better way to earn them. We’re monitoring your feedback, and will continue to make adjustments as necessary.</div></div><hr />

I wish they would address the fact that they killed our damage on the move with Fel Flame in order to force us to stand still for damage, but then do nothing to increase our ability to kite or decrease a Warrior's ability to have 100% uptime on us.<br />

This comment could be more right than you know. The game will slowly move to a Diablo-esque limited action set system. I'm agnostic on this because a lot of systems do it and it's well done, but at the same time, it's not iconic WoW, and if that's what they wanted, they should have just launched a new game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot; Binding Heal is now only available to Holy Priests. <br />
Borrowed Time has been removed.<br />
Inner Focus has been removed. no longer provides any mana cost reduction.<br />
Inner Will has been removed.<br />
Pain Suppression no longer reduces the target’s threat by 5%.<br />
Strength of Soul has been removed.<br />
Train of Thought has been removed.<br />
Divine Star now has a 1.5-second cast time (up from instant cast), but can be cast while moving. &quot;<br />
<br />
Ability pruning my ass. They've been derping our classes for years. Things such as putting a CD on dispel, planting cast times on abilities like Prayer of Mending (Seriously, WTF is that?) and removing abilities like Binding Heal from a Disc's spell roster (Something I've come to seriously rely on over the years) is simply a disgrace. I've played disc since BC, and they've never made changes half this dramatic. This is a clear move to neutralize the game for casuals. We should just &quot;prune&quot; it down to 4-5 abilities while we're at it, you know. League of Legends style-We wouldn't want people having to press too many keys!</div></div><hr />

Nah, they've pruned lots of passives by fusing them with the skills they modified. A global passive won't really clutter anything. You can't put &quot;receives 5% more mastery&quot; on every tooltip!</div></div><hr />

<br />
The first round of cuts i was shocked by a lot of them, but the 3 classes i play are hunter (main) priest and druid...and seems those 3 classes (opinon) got hit the hardest, esp druids....and hunters lost so much stuff, i just cant believe how far they took this, and the decisions they are making, terrible decisions that may finally put the final nail in my 10 year wow career<br />
<br />
Not liking the removal of serpent sting, only for survival? just will feel weird for awhile, and arcane shot proccing it now? and the way it ticks for damage, i dont know...i am going to hate logging in when 6.0 comes out, and only have 6 things on my bar, total, like wth is that? its the most massive amount of changes this game has faced maybe ever, all in 1 go, like everything is changing, gear, stats, professions, pvp, core classes, i cant remember a time that this chaotic and insane, how much they are going to change the game, its going to be like going back to vanilla, almost, starting over kinda with all these changes, it will feel like starting over learning everything again, less options, less stats, etc. <br />

But even then, you'd need some kind of passive informing players of that special trait, since it's exclusive to only one specialization. It needs to be documented somewhere in-game players can easily see.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They have already stated that the basic healing model will be changing in a way that will put more stress on the healers. If, on top of this, they chop up the healing classes and make them less fun to play in general they may trigger a general exodus away from healing. <br />
<br />
I've always favored healing classes, largely because they are more flexible, more complex and more varied in play than straight dps classes. But now healing is getting dumbed down, effects being removed, cast times added, spells limited etc. <br />
<br />
So I'm now leveling a hunter to be a back-up to my five healing classes. If healing turns stupid and un-fun I'll just derp my way through WoD as a hunter and try to get my money's worth.</div></div><hr />

I think the only class with a legitimate gripe at this point are the druids. Genesis is a poor substitute for Bloom, and they seem to be taking away any ability to use another form's abilities outside that form. Good idea or not that's at least a drastic change.

On top of that, they completed slaughtering whatever hybridization we have left. Sure we have &quot;Heart of the Wild&quot; but what's the point when you have 3 buttons for everything but your main spec? I know they want to keep the clutter down so it's easier for new people to join, but it doesn't mean they have to completely take away all the original things we've had. &quot;Starfire has been removed, wrath now changes to starfire upon reaching lunar eclipse.&quot; I wouldn't be shocked if this was next. <br />
<br />
On top of that, they took out the one cool idea they gave to healers for WoD, complex mana regen, and made it passive. Really hoping the axing and snipping of complexity is worth it gameplay wise.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Though I'll admit I barely needed it. Most situations you can just run through them, aggro, and vanish; or vanish, run through them with improved stealth, and be done with it.<br />
<br />
The least they could do is stick the &quot;attacks turn into shadow damage&quot; thing in with adrenaline rush, since they've shared a cooldown through MOP. Or just keep the ability, lower the cooldown, and remove the increased combo point aspect of it, so it can be used effectively with things other than adrenaline rush.</div></div><hr />

My theory is with Titan canceled or &quot;postponed indefinitely&quot; that the changes being made to WoW that put it on par with D3 is because they are planning a WoW WoD console release. ability pruning = less buttons required = dumbed down combat + microtransactions = console $$$</div></div><hr />

when they were removing talent trees that was dumbing game down like hell - and now this ? wtf will be left - time to look for a nice private server i guess feel bad for game really :(<br />

and honestly if they were planing this for longer time and only releasing this now no wonder why Ghostcrawler left - whatever leftovers will survive this purge ot wont be same game ever again :(<br />
Why the fuck are you sorry?<br />
<br />
I have played my Shaman since TBC and I am super excited.<br />
<br />
Removing the talent tree did NOT AT ALL dumb down the game, it actually gave me choice, as a Resto Shaman I had 3 points out of 61 that where not mandatory which meant I could have 2% crit or instant ghost wolf, that was it THAT WAS ALL I COULD CHOOSE BETWEEN every single other point was mandatory.<br />

In MoP I change talents all the time based on play style and situation.<br />

This is true except for the part where it's not true at all. There will be less skills available to most classes than there were during the days of classic WoW. There is no way you can argue this, especially in the case of druids. <br />

Actually it is true and the changes for druids and most the Hybrid classes are making it so they have the abilities their SPECS should have not every ability every spec the entire class has.<br />
I can argue it quite well since even after looking at all the moves that have been removed I still have more keybinds per spec than I did per a whole class in TBC.<br />

Yes, there were more skills, such as Amplify Magic, Dampen Magic, Frost Ward, Fire Ward, Arcane Ward. They were heavily used.... not. Rotations for most if not all classes were much simpler than they are now and even simpler than they will be in WoD.<br />
<br />
This is a good change. Watching for 10 cooldowns/procs and praying to RNG gods to line up procs for big bada boom cooldown doesn't make it a fun game play.</div></div><hr />

I was replying to this. You see, when Blizzard says: &quot;Entangling Roots is now available only to Balance and Restoration Druids.&quot; this means it is removing that skill from the other two specs, Guardian and Feral. This means as that spec, you have one less button than you otherwise would have prior to this change, which would be TBC.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, when Blizzard says: &quot;Hibernate has been removed.&quot; this means that this spell is no longer available to any spec of druids, which would make the druid have less skills than they did in TBC.<br />
<br />

The only reason you may excuse yourself from fuck off is that you actually like this game?

<br />
I think the way it will work is that if you're in an area that has no flying, you'll go into travel form. If you are in an area that you can fly in, you'll go flight form. And if you're swimming, you'll go aquatic form. So all three forms can be used, just will depend on where you are. If you're in MoP lands but don't have the MoP flying, you'll go travel form. Once you get the flying there, you'll be able to go flight form. And with WoD having no flying, you'll be travel forming it most times :)<br />
<br />
At least, that's how I think it will work.</div></div><hr />

Weak troll is weak. Every single xpac added new spells and synergies (in the form of passives) to the game, most of them far more meaningful than fucking Hibernate, a spell which is typically used... ah yes, almost never.</div></div><hr />

I for one am happy that they remove so many abilites or fuse them with other abilites. Don't really know who _wants_ to have 10 useless skills on your action bars which some could easily be a part of something more logical. <br />
<br />
Yes, I play druid and those removals/prunes are more than welcome. People just tend to ignore everything after the - xxxx has been removed - sentence. They said they would add something to _compensate_ for the loss of that specific ability. Same goes for Shamans, immediately after saying &quot;MTT has been removed&quot; was a sentence -&gt; &quot;Restoration Shaman Mana costs have been adjusted to compensate.&quot;<br />
<br />
As for the CC removals: There were way too much CC already, it's about time they did something to that. It must feel dull to have Scare Beast etc removed, but again - other classes lose something too -, no reason to raise the hell just because someone's favorite class had something removed.<br />
<br />
Please people, think this as a whole and don't focus on certain classes/mechanics that has been pruned.</div></div><hr />

Really...? Just because they remove/fuse a couple of abilites, the game suddenly only has 5 buttons to press? As if.<br />
Let's have an example :Resto Shaman -<br />
<br />
&quot;Ow, so many prunes!! This has to mean WoW is becoming Diablo 4... I only have to press: Healing surge, Greater healing wave, lesser healing wave, healing stream totem, tremor totem, earth shield, cleanse spirit, ascendance, healing rain, spirit-link totem, hex, lightning bolt, frost shock, healing tide totem, chain heal...&quot; and the list goes on, you get my point, right?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was replying to this. You see, when Blizzard says: &quot;Entangling Roots is now available only to Balance and Restoration Druids.&quot; this means it is removing that skill from the other two specs, Guardian and Feral. This means as that spec, you have one less button than you otherwise would have prior to this change, which would be TBC.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, when Blizzard says: &quot;Hibernate has been removed.&quot; this means that this spell is no longer available to any spec of druids, which would make the druid have less skills than they did in TBC.<br />
<br />
Hopefully this clears things up for you and the concept of arithmetic hasn't strained your very obviously damaged brain too badly. :)<br />
<br />
So if they gained 20 spells since TBC and lose 5-10 in WoD, that is somehow a net loss for them overall since TBC?<br />
<br />
I don't think you are the right person to be calling OTHER people brain damaged.</div></div><hr />

Personally, I dont like the removal of Mana Tide Totem. Screw Water Shield tbh, it only inflated our efficiency because of the flat increase if mana regen in the early part of an expansion, but Mana Tide has just always been around.<br />
I get that everything that regen's mana for a healer is now bound through Spirit, with the exception of Mana Tea (And perhaps the glyph for Holy Shock?), but I do not personally like that. I have always been the person who used Mana Tide Totem as a raid utility and not for my own mana regen. Sure I had times where I needed the mana more than the other healers, but that was not the case most of the time. Well, that is now gone, I can now turn off mana bars on my Raid UI, because aint needing to keep a check anymore...</div></div><hr />

I'm pretty sure he's talking about people who stopped playing, clearly hate the game, but sit around on MMO-Champion, read the news and then post in the forum about how shit it is, glad they stopped playing and are now playing ESO/wildstar/flavour of the month de jour. <br />

Some of these people apparently hate the game so much but can't stop reading about it, like an obsessive boyfriend who gets dumped, says he hates her then stalks her forever.

NGE – (n): Short for “New Game Experience”. NGE was introduced into the very popular game of Star Wars Galaxies back when it was quite popular, as a way of making it complete against Blizzard’s “World of Warcraft”. Although little is known about who actually did what, there is strong evidence that LucasArts forced Sony’s Dev team to completely rewrite the interface as well as the entire gaming system so that it resembled something closer to WoW’s interface. This was an attempt to get more people from the pre-teen and early teen market. One of the changes was that the complex and original skilltree was replaced by a simple, yet restrictive and unoriginal skill line. For the majority of players the game became unplayable and Star Wars Galaxies never recovered from the event. <br />
<br />
Since that time, the term “NGE” has referred to any situation where either Developers or Game Owners make stupid, short-sighted changes, in the belief that they know how to make the game “better”. “Better” in this context usually means, “Get more money now. Honesty, quality, even facts, are not considered”.</div></div><hr />

No, they've explained many times they're just trying to reduce the amount of keybinds needed and unneccesary spells, by baking existing effects into other spells.<br />
<br />
I'm one of the few open minded ones, I think WoD is going to feel really fresh and streamlined. I know it's a running joke here about how &quot;blizzard can't balance&quot; but I think it's going to be balanced and fun, can't wait.<br />
<br />
It's also one of the things that kept me from playing other classes extensively, learning all the spells and abilities and interactions became so arbitrarily complicated I preferred to just stick to playing 2 or 3 alts.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This isn't pruning, it's a butchering of most abilities across the board. As a former druid player, I can't even imagine losing so much of what defines them as an hybrid class.</div></div><hr />

This is exactly the right way to go if you want a balanced game along with the stat squish.<br />
<br />
A few abilities being removed from here and there definitely won't &quot;dump down&quot; anything, there will still be: bad - average - good and great players for each class, few abilities gone won't make it any different... It's not like all the difficulty from mastering the class just vanishes if for example: Envenom now passively refreshes SnD?<br />
<br />
It just makes me frustrated to read comments like that. I know people are upset by certain abilities being removed or merged, but just blindly claiming it's going to dump down the difficulty to &quot;facerolling&quot; levels is just silly.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The question is &quot; &quot;If I need to relearn the game again , and the classes again ... why should I re-learn an 10 years old game instead to learn a new one ? &quot; The familiarity is gone , anyway .<br />
<br />
Exactly this is why Sony failed with StarWars Galaxies when they radically changed the game and the classes with NGE.<br />
<br />
They made chages to dumb down the game , so they can get new players. No new players came , but the old players left because they didn't recognized the game anymore. Was not familiar to them anymore. And to add insult to injury ,now Blizzard delete the flying and also do a itemsquish , so the confusion to be even bigger. Yeah , will work sooooo well. No wonder Ghostcrawler left . The guy definitely saw the trainwreck incoming.<br />
<br />
Imagine for example a player , who didn't played since WOTLK, is returning . When will log , he will see the mess , will not understand sht from his old belowed druid or warrior , and will just say &quot;f.o&quot; &quot;.</div></div><hr />

Classes have been losing spells with nearly every expansion and the best example i can give is the Warlock (my main). Over the years we have lost iconic spells and abilities such and mana drain, voidwalker's detect stealth, the warlock weapon stone enchants the firestone and spellstone, searing pain (basically the same as scorch for fire mages), fel armor, also soul gems used to be an item that went in your bag. i remember having to farm soul gems and that was a pain in the ass.<br />
<br />
Dark intent used to be an awesome buff &quot;you link yourself with the targeted friendly target, increasing both of your haste by 3%. When you or the linked target gains a critical periodic damage or healing effect, the other gains increased periodic damage and healing lasting for 7 seconds. You gain 3%, while the target gains 1%. Stacks up to 3 times. Dark Intent lasts for 30 min.&quot; loved putting this on a resto druid :(..... I wont get into the old talent tree system because that is a bit dated, but i do miss the old hybrid build in having felguard and unstable affliction.<br />

Im sure iv missed a few spells. But in the end the warlock still feels the same and is the dark caster that iv always played.</div></div><hr />

I said I am not sure if it will be the case, but from what I read my fear is that my characters (and the game in general) are not going to feel the same at all, this is just a fear and I will not know for certain until I sit down in front of WoD and play it for a bit.</div></div><hr />

Hey, psst, Blizzard! Hire this guy. You may like the way he thinks.<br />

But seriously, this is out of control. Stop removing skills from the game. It's fine if they remove some skills from a specific spec but removing the skill from all specs make no sense. I saw at least 5 hunter skills are removed in this post(well some of them are replaced tho) and i see that this is ALPHA but the way that blizzard think is annoying.

I wish they would address the fact that they killed our damage on the move with Fel Flame in order to force us to stand still for damage, but then do nothing to increase our ability to kite or decrease a Warrior's ability to have 100% uptime on us.<br />
<br />
I have said previously that CoE was bloat, and that really all those debuffs should be removed.<br />
They simply restricted the choice of players, as all those &quot;debuff-slots&quot; had to be filled in smaller groups.<br />
The removal of the mutual exclusivity, and the AoE were really just desperate attempts to keep it relevant or interesting.<br />
<br />
There are more upcoming changes for Warlocks amongst others.<br />
I suspect we are going to see a dramatic shift regarding KJC and Fel Flame.<br />
I will go as far as predicting either the return of Fel Flame or a cast-time spell usable while moving to give something during movement.<br />
I call it as Fel Flame, or perhaps the return of Searing Pain.</div></div><hr />

Doesn't mean the class is any good either. Symbiosis with Shaman was great when you had to move around and heal. They shouldn't have bothered to give RDruids Symbiosis or anything in the MoP expansion if they were going to get rid of everything for WoD. Druids got screwed over.<br />
<br />
By glory days you mean where only 2% of the community experienced any of the game content let alone had any fun (good luck getting that dragon rep without epic flying during the bc days)? I don't miss Ikiss being bugged and a painful fight, nor do I miss the bullshit from Shadowmoon and Shattered Halls. Shadowmoon valley was a horrible endgame zone.<br />
<br />
Games should be challenging, but not bullshit at the same time.</div></div><hr />

Something is wrong with the way you think.... You throw a tantrum when they remove abilities that make healing available while moving (as if druid's weren't mobile enough even without it). Doesn't that make healing easier, no? Then in the same post you say that games should be challenging...? Wait, what?</div></div><hr />

<br />
But as Axislip said above I will wait and see in either beta or live before I pass judgement on whether all of this will be good or bad, at the moment we just don't know how the classes will play until we see what it is like in action..<br />

I was like WTF myself with what they were doing but then I thought about it and well and as I said above I will wait and see whether all of these changes are good or bad..</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yea, 5% bonusses to specific secondary stats for all specs does not help with that. GG Blizzard. The fact that I unsubbed months ago is only turning out into an even better decision.<br />
<br />
Of course there's also the ability pruning... But come on. I don't even need to say anything anymore. Even the lowliest noob can see that Blizzard is screwing up royal.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What does encounter and zone design have to do with class balance and the metagame (and the latter is what the ability pruning is about)? <br />
<br />
I also fail to see how having four instead of five buttons in your main rotation plus one instead of three throughput cooldowns makes the game any less interesting or demanding. Quite frankly, doing a damage, healing or tanking rotation is ridiculuously easy either way, any semi-competent player who stumbled his way to level 90 should be able to remember how to press five buttons in the right order. Good players separate themselves from bad ones because of their situational awareness, responding to changing conditions immediately and correctly and keeping their cool no matter how heated the fight gets, NOT because they are able to press CTRL + ALT + 8 without breaking their hand. This is true for both PvE and PvP.<br />
<br />
The main benefit of the ability pruning is PvP in my opinion. In the last two Xpacs, the game has turned into a giant clusterfuck, with a counter to every ability, a counter to the counter, tons of instant CC and whatnot. In TBC, everyone had fewer abilities and as a result, the game was far more strategic and skill-demanding.<br />
<br />
Oh and one more thing: How on earth can people seriously believe that the ability pruning will actually change the RELATIVE strength of classes to each other? Of course Blizzard will adjust the numbers before release so that all specs perform very closely to each other, at least in PvE. They have done that since WotLK. And PvP will also be easier to balance simply because of the reduction of abilities which are OP in one situation and completely useless in another. The removal of Symbiosis, Necrotic Strike, Hibernate, blanket Silences and other CC alone (and that's just off the top of my head) will make things so much easier to keep balanced.</div></div><hr />

The variable on how much spirit a person stacks .. where will they baseline this &quot;lowering of spell cost&quot;. Based on which resto shaman criteria ? in addition the loss of proc on water shield from ranged attacks. Also a very difficult criteria to quantify. We don't stand in melee as a rule so it would seem to me that a large portion of water shield proc IS from ranged attacks. But again difficult to quantify based on differences in fight mechanics. So from fight to fight this would be a WIDELY varying loss of mana regen.<br />
<br />
The one thing i can usually count on is that the first half of an expac will cause half of resto shamans to go running for the hills. This seems no different.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Crit does more damage on chance, Multistrike can proc other abilities whilst doing more damage but not as much as Crit. 2 different stats so comparing them as if they were the same is just asinine, since whilst they both increase damage they do it in different ways.</div></div><hr />

Get ready everyone!<br />
<br />
<br />
and by get ready u mean get ready for each class to use 3-4 buttons as in this video and &quot;being ready for pve&quot; at least according to blizz ? - ye this is exackly what is coming with wod - and worst is ... idiots will still smash those 3 buttons wrong way and do shitty dps -_-<br />

<br />
strange thing is now eveyrbody can experience content - and nearly eveeybody complains about it like fuck - people complain that they are deadly bored people complain how many times they unsub during expansion people complain that they cant be full raid ready geared 2 hours after they ding 90 people complain how blizz is forcing them to do this aviable for everyboy content to gear up - itsi aviable for eveyrone and .... and people still complain cause they are to retarded to do anything beynd lfr. and blizzard is failing again in wod - hc dungeons were supposed to be alternative way of gearing up for good players who want to skip lfr - well guess what blizzard is still forcing people to do this aviable for eveyrone content cause they know that retards and idiots in lfr wont be able to clear it without being carried<br />
<br />
its dumbing game down with each expansion and guess what each year they loose 1-2 mln players and not geting new ones no matter how &quot;retard-friendly&quot; politics they address.<br />
<br />
At some point catering to idiots in game needs to stop - they got enough content over last 5 years - time to cater a bit to this 10% on top who actually want chalenge in game.<br />
Cause those 10% are those who advice guide and drag those 90 % of idiots through eveyr content which was supposedly designed for themU can clearly see it in SoO lfr what happened when those top 10% skiped it to flex straight - utter frikin failure - to the point that blizzard is making lfr even more retard-proff tourist mode in WoD</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Puntar</div><div class="date">2014-06-15, 05:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the way it will work is that if you're in an area that has no flying, you'll go into travel form. If you are in an area that you can fly in, you'll go flight form. And if you're swimming, you'll go aquatic form. So all three forms can be used, just will depend on where you are. If you're in MoP lands but don't have the MoP flying, you'll go travel form. Once you get the flying there, you'll be able to go flight form. And with WoD having no flying, you'll be travel forming it most times :)<br />
<br />
At least, that's how I think it will work.<br />
<br />
Hmmm, I actually do wonder how will Blizz address changing into flying form. I do hope it would NOT work as you suggested for flying, because that would mean I would need to click twice If I wanted to change into travel form.<br />
<br />
Many Druids (and also me) just instinctively jump and change into flying form. I do hope that sequence become the norm to change into flying where player is allowed to. <br />
<br />
Jump + Travel form &gt; Flying form</div></div><hr />

Just to clarify for all the disc priest haters out there i'm not moaning about spirit shell, I don't care if Blizzard removes abilities because they believe it affects the game negatively, but to remove core mechanics for a class that make you think and simply add 1 spam aoe heal... how is that improving a healing class? or making the class less 'boring'? I realise it's alpha and things can change but atm all the changes have been to simplify gameplay and dumbing down heroic end game content. This expansion is going to be a joke.</div></div><hr />
