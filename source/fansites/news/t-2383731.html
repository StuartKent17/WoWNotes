Hotfix - Pantheon Trinket Drops Obey Loot Spec<br />
Blizzard made Pantheon Trinket (http://blog.askmrrobot.com/pantheon-trinkets/) drops after the first always obey your loot spec. <br />
Hey guys! Just wanted to follow up with this since there was quite a bit of discussion and some really good feedback on how the Epic Pantheon Trinkets are awarded. Recently we've pushed forward a change before this current reset.<br />
<br />
The Pantheon trinkets for drops after the first now obey your loot specializations. Previously it only followed your loot specialization for the first one and the second was random for your other specs. <br />
<br />
Appreciate all of the feedback you guys have been giving us about this!<br />

Mythic Dungeon Invitational: Prepping for the Time Trials<br />
With the Proving Grounds of the Mythic Dungeon Invitational (MDI) wrapping up, we wanted to share more information on the next stage of the event, the MDI Time Trials!<br />
<br />
Everything You Need to Know About MDI Time Trials<br />
For last year’s first Mythic Dungeon Invitational, only the top 8 teams were invited to take part in the next stage. This year, we’re allowing even more teams to compete for their share of the $200,000 global prize pool. All eligible teams who complete the MDI Proving Grounds will receive an invitation to the Tournament Realms, which are specifically configured realms for the next stage of the tournament. All players will have access to the same top-end gear to equip their character and prove that they have what it takes to be crowned as the global Mythic Dungeon Invitational champions.<br />
<br />
What are the Time Trials?<br />
Kicking off Tuesday, March 27, the Time Trials is a way for us to judge the overall skill, expertise, and flexibility of teams as they tackle three dungeons across different difficulties. Some teams are good at pushing high keys, or surviving nasty affixes, or maybe they’ve mastered a single dungeon. But in the MDI, teams need to have all these skills to thrive and make it to the top.<br />
<br />
Dungeon 1 - Maw of Souls +20<br />
<br />
Bursting<br />
Quaking<br />
Fortified<br />
<br />
<br />
Dungeon 2 - Upper Karazhan +22<br />
<br />
Raging<br />
Explosive<br />
Tyrannical<br />
<br />
<br />
Dungeon 3 - Neltharion's Lair +24<br />
<br />
Sanguine<br />
Grievous<br />
Fortified<br />
<br />
<br />
These three dungeons will be the sole focus for teams during the week of Time Trials and all teams will have unlimited tries on the Tournament Realm to refine and master these dungeons.<br />
<br />
Just completing the dungeons in time won’t be enough and teams will need to push themselves to see how fast they can run each of the dungeons. We’ll compile each team’s fastest time on each dungeon and add all three times together for their Time Trials score. Only the top 8 scores for each region move onto the Regional Bracket stage, so expect teams to be fiercely competitive to stay on top of the pack.<br />
<br />
Make sure you submit your scores (https://mythicdungeoninvitational.wufoo.com/forms/m154hh9q1s6vx23/) from the Proving Grounds period. All entries must be received by March 16 by 3:00 p.m. PDT. Only dungeons completed during the Proving Ground period will be considered.<br />
<br />
Keep on top of all the latest news on our new MDI hub (https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/esports/mythic)!<br />

Voice Acted Quests Shut Down<br />
Recently, TioMiklas (https://www.mmo-champion.com/members/1434487-TioMiklas) started a community driven add-on project called Voice Acted Quests (https://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/2381319-We-need-your-help-voicing-all-wow-quests), which called for players to become voice actors for the quests in World of Warcraft. The addon played audio of the quest dialogue over the quest text and was voiced by members of the WoW community. The project was gaining steam, but has met the same fate as Bellular (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwiaPYufmQOq5F1TI-FzQhw)'s Warcraft Tales project and was shut down by Blizzard (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tm7h49s3NDI).<br />
Hello TioMiklas,<br />
<br />
I’m Josh Allen, from the World of Warcraft Community Team. We came across your Voice Acted Quests project, and I have to say, the work you’ve put into it is very impressive!<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, I’ve been told that this project infringes on our intellectual copyrights in a way that we can’t allow. You may recall a similar situation with an addon called “Warcraft Tales” a few months ago. While your project is slightly different, it’s still considered a re-performance of our established works.<br />
<br />
Because of that, we have to ask you to stop production and distribution of the Voice Acted Quests project. Rather than going straight to delivering a legal notice, they’ve asked me to contact you directly to deliver the news and answer any questions you may have. Like I said, it’s a very impressive project and we recognize the amount of work you’ve put into it, it’s just not the sort of thing we can allow to be created using our copyright.<br />
<br />
Sorry for the bad news.<br />
<br />
Hey again, sorry for the delay in getting back. I managed to sync up with the higher-ups here again with your questions.<br />
<br />
The issue isn't about any potential monetary gains. The issue is simply that Blizzard doesn't want third parties to create in-game story content for WoW, and creating a vocal performance for existing lines falls inside that. No one here thinks you’re trying to be malicious – I’m being completely honest when I say we found your work impressive!<br />
<br />
That’s about the extent of what I can comment on myself. Anything further would need to come from our legal team. <br />
<br />
<br />

Polygon's Warcraft Chronicle Volume 3 Preview<br />
Polygon (https://www.polygon.com/2018/3/9/17093986/blizzard-world-of-warcraft-chronicle-3) took a quick look at Warcraft Chronicle Volume 3 (https://amzn.to/2FsgbTA) as well including a chapter that was not on the Amazon Prime Preview (https://www.mmo-champion.com/content/7429-World-of-Warcraft-Chronicle-Volume-3-Preview-Blue-Posts-Allcraft-Curse-Hiring).<br />

Snakes Sneak into Spring Finals from North America Cup 3<br />
With the Spring Finals on the horizon and Europe’s top four decided, teams from North America duked it out in the third AWC North American Cup. With Method Orange flying high after success in the second N.A. cup, their spot at the Spring Finals live event seemed guaranteed, leaving four teams in the region to battle for three spots.<br />
<br />
The third North American cup was a story of upsets with Super Frogs not even making the top 8 and Method Orange stumbling early and falling to the lower bracket against Tilted. In what was a huge match for seeding in the Spring Finals, The Rejects, with 120 points this season, swept Method Black, who sat on 140 points, leaving both teams on the cusp of the fourth Spring Finals spot. In the upper bracket semifinals, The Rejects set themselves up for a Spring Finals berth with a 3-1 win over Fairly Caustic. On the other side, Tilted beat Sneakier Snakes in a tight 3-2 match to advance to the upper bracket finals. In the lower bracket, Method Orange went past Fairly Caustic with ease and Method Black fell to Sneakier Snakes.Snakes then eliminated the regional heavyweights 3-1 with the split pressure from the Jungle Cleave too much for Method Orange to handle.<br />
<br />
<br />
https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/march/thumb/springQualifier.jpg (https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/march/springQualifier.jpg) <br />
<br />
In the upper bracket finals, The Rejects managed to get past Tilted 3-1 thanks to the burst damage from their Rogue/Shaman composition. In the lower bracket, Sneakier Snakes and Tilted set up a rematch with a spot in the cup final and a chance at the Spring Finals on the line. The series went the way of the Snakes 3-1 setting up a grand final against The Rejects with a high seed at the Spring Finals going to the winner. In the end, the damage from Sneakier Snakes’ Jungle Cleave was too much for The Rejects to handle and it was a quick sweep for the Snakes. With that win, Sneakier Snakes’ booked their spot into the Spring Finals and look to be going into the Spring Finals with all the momentum.<br />
<br />
With the four teams from North America set—Method Orange, The Rejects, Super Frogs, and Sneakier Snakes—the field of teams for the Spring Finals is complete. Looking ahead to the Spring Finals, Sneakier Snakes are the in-form team but Method Orange have been the more dominant team from North America and are the team looking to make their mark internationally in 2018. The Spring Finals should be a stylistic matchup too, as the RMP that seems to be more prevalent in Europe will face off against the more aggressive Jungle Cleave and Windwalker/Death Knight compositions from North America.<br />
<br />
All style battles and bragging rights will be decided at the Spring Finals beginning March 31.<br />

It's literally just text from their quests being voice acted by various people, and the only thing being created is audio to go along with already written dialogue. What is this infringing on? This is almost the equivalent to them shutting down a content creator or streamer for reading quest dialogue in their streams/videos.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Mostly because it's directly using the game's assets which is illegal under current copyright laws. Using those assets indirectly (art, videos, streaming etc.) is protected under fair use.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately with copyright laws it's a use 'em or lose 'em situation. Blizzard's hand is forced in these situations. In court they would have a hard time saying this addon is okay, while an addon that changes quest text is not okay. So they have to cover all of them equally to protect their IP.<br />
<br />
But it really sucks, I was looking forward to that addon :(</div></div><hr />

IMO - and for the record, IANAL - The *performance*, not what is being said, is the in game content they are referring to. It allows 3rd parties to create mood, context, and subtext to the written text that they might not be comfortable with. If they intend a character to feel sad or conflicted about said events and the voice acting depicts them as happy or angry, that changes the context of their work in a way they are uncomfortable with.</div></div><hr />

Pretty much all MMO's in recent years have full-voice acting. Every line in ESO for instance is fully voiced. <br />
With general good quality. Main quests have a bit more veteran voice actors. As should be. It really adds to the immersion. <br />
I remember a quest during Legion where you walk with Anduin around Stormwind. He's voiced. But the people he's talking to aren't. <br />
It felt weird, and was quite annoyed by it. Time spent with your king should be epic. And not immersion breaking... <br />
But I guess being the top MMO means you can slack in certain departments.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The inflection of a voice and the emphasis on specific syllables and words can radically alter the entire meaning of a single line of dialog. If a volunteer voice actor gets that wrong, it changes the story in a way Blizzard cannot predict.<br />
<br />
Having a voice-acted recording is extremely different than players reading the quest text in their own heads, interpreting it their own way. A recording creates an identical experience for everyone.<br />
<br />
Blizzard is very careful in who they hire as a voice actor and with which studio takes they put in game. If this addon were allowed to grow in popularity, it might get to a point where it displaces Blizzard's own control of its storytelling.<br />
<br />
This project crosses a line and they can't permit it.</div></div><hr />

There were some excellent explanations as to why they have little choice but to shut it down above but I suppose you closed your eyes and scrolled to avoid making an informed mistake. After all, you can only be judged based on what information you already possess, amirite?<br />
<br />
I for one hope they take the route of the author/community and start to voice all quests in the future (with an option to disable it or click past it at least, obviously).</div></div><hr />

<br />
and they still do, this literally just fucking happened, they could still contact some of these people and hire them (if they are good, but somehow i doubt they were top quality...)<br />
also making an addon that plays a soundfile when a quest is opened is pretty fucking easy... its not like this dude is pulling out a new innovative thing.<br />
Yes its nice but there is ALOT of old quests, so the mount of time and money it would take to do all of them...</div></div><hr />

WoW fully voice acted like ESO would be AMAZING! I understand that its protecting their IP but damn dude... at the very least I hope that they can see the desire for this. I have faith in Blizzard to make good judgement calls and take action when the time is right but this is painful to watch.</div></div><hr />

What a terrible company. Actually shutting down work by great fans of the game, yikes. way to persuade even more players you're the bad guys Blizzard.<br />

This addon was going to spread out your weak ass walls of text for a more immersive questing experience, such as walking into a cave and getting exposition and quest information from the environment and creatures rather than a single questgiver; it wasn't malicious at all. your walls of text are literally available to download anywhere. <br />

Shame on you Blizzard.<br />
<br />
next up: an addon which changes the textures and models to player painted and modelled ones. blizzard has to let that one go! it is fan-made and so cool and not at all copyright-infringing!</div></div><hr />

And in that time before one of our actual tanks received one, our two plate melee DPS had already gotten a tank trinket to drop as well. It was incredibly stupid.<br />

The questing UI wasn't a part of the WoWVAQ addon - what you are seeing there is another addon. I think it's Immersion or Storyline. I don't recall. I have it in my addon lists as well. It just helps make the text a little more tolerable. <br />
<br />
The addon itself did nothing more than play a sound bite when you started certain quests. <br />

The reasoning seems to be that it goes against blizzards storytelling, it changes the games story in a way that could be missleading, as a &quot;My men are dead&quot; could ingame supposed to be sad and mournful, but the voice actor could make them sound happy, changing the dude from a sad man to a hateful happy man.<br />
<br />
so that seems to be what might cause it but idk for sure.</div></div><hr />

Oh definitely. I know the reasoning. I was just arguing that it didn't make money in response to one of the other posts. <br />

I can see their logic like you said, it's not like when we were voicing these quests we knew what we should be trying for. We could infer...but that's not necessarily going to work sometimes.</div></div><hr />

What about re-performing the sound of Hot Streak for example, you can literally change any sound trigger of the game without any issues except text to speech/voice, it's hypocritically, either a flaw in the law or double standards. Hot Streak is supposed to sound like a fire gaining more heat, when I change it to a freezing wind I would be re-performing the intellectual property of Hot Streak.<br />
<br />
Like I said, it makes no sense logically.<br />
<br />
On top of that, you are not even re-performing anything. You are ADDING sound to something. Again, we do that daily with countless addons, sound cues for boss mechanics etc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just to make things clear, this was a project where no money was involved, it was just a way for fans/players to give back to wow by submitting their own voices in order to have all quests voiced.<br />
In a very short amount of time we had already released 7 leveling zones and we were planning to have all 1-110 zones voiced in about 3-4 months!<br />
<br />
Even though the addon had a sad ending, i just want to mention that it was a blast and that we had a friendly community where every one was having fun and in some cases try out voice acting for the first time.<br />
<br />
I have tried my best to talk to blizzard and try to make the addon work without violating any ip/law troubles but to no success.<br />
<br />
So what I ask of you all is not to go after/insult blizzard staff, but instead to demonstrate your interest in something like this to exist in wow. Let Blizzard know that you want voiced quests or just more immersion in wow in general. Post it on foruns/twitter/Q&amp;A/youtube whatever.<br />
<br />
I thank you all once again, and hopefully something good is born out of all this! See you all in Azeroth :D!<br />

They still scout animators, artists, theorycraters and so on, but only if their work is exception/special in some ways.

<br />
I think it would be great if they could get community members to voice the minor NPCs for quests while letting the professional VAs voice the major characters. That would keep costs down (although anyone that puts in work in a commercial product should be credited and remunerated), and let every NPC have a unique voice. <br />

<br />
Shame on you Blizzard.<br />
<br />
First off... lots of news to report. It isn't being hidden by MMO-C... like dafuq? If they were trying to hide... why bother posting it at all? Logic is clearly not your strong suit as the rest of your post will solidify. Additionally, many people are already commenting on it here... so clearly... they didn't &quot;hide&quot; it very well.<br />
<br />
Intellectual property isn't just about money, its about protecting the image, protecting the brand.<br />
<br />
As many posters have already mentioned there is the possibility of changing how the story is told. It then becomes an interpretation of the story... and not necessarily the story itself.<br />
<br />
Additionally allowing someone to run with your IP runs the risk that people may enjoy the idea/product better... in which case you could potentially LOSE your IP. The longer you let people borrow your IP, the weaker your case gets at protecting it.<br />
<br />
Bottom line here is that the government isn't going to protect your IP for you, you either do it yourself, or you lose it. Blizzard is playing the only card available to them.<br />
<br />
I would hope that anyone who is a fan of Warcraft has the wherewithal to recognize its roots in Warhammer, and is actually a perfect example of how not properly protecting your IP can result in someone else making a better product off YOUR IP. By the time Games Workshop took action against Blizzard it was too late.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In Bossmods you can add any anime voice to a boss mechanic where the boss shouts something like: &quot;Beware my awesome power&quot; to &quot;Ryū ga waga teki wo kurau!&quot;. Again, I am asking where is the difference when it's happening all over the place. That is actual re-performing, you are changing the entire message. Whereas when you simply perform the text word for word you are not even changing anything at all. It's a mind numbing stupid differentiation to shake off the first while scolding the latter.<br />
<br />
If they were really honest with it, they would need to forbid a LOT of addons that change sounds, add sounds or remove sounds. Performing something word for word while not changing any contextual text is literally just reading it. When I read a book out loud I am not &quot;re-performing&quot; it, I am reading it out loud. This is insanely stupid to take legal actions against. Are you telling me when I read a book I am infringing the copyright? Lmao, NO!</div></div><hr />

It allows 3rd parties to create mood, context, and subtext to the written text that they might not be comfortable with.

It's pretty much a consensus among copyright attorneys at this point that for some strange reason companies don't get to exercise discretion when it comes to protecting IP. That by allowing one fan project to operate without challenge gives more malicious actors an avenue of legal defense.<br />

I'm not surprised that it was shut down by Blizzard considering how they are, but I don't get why they have to be like this towards this specific addon. It's literally just text from their quests being voice acted by various people, and the only thing being created is audio to go along with already written dialogue. What is this infringing on? This is almost the equivalent to them shutting down a content creator or streamer for reading quest dialogue in their streams/videos.<br />
<br />
It's really no different than creating an unauthorized audiobook, which would clearly be infringement.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For the life of the game, 3rd party addon developers have improved upon a geriatric UX at minimal cost to Blizzard. 3 years later and Blizzard has suspended or terminated 4 addons I can think of that improve the questing experience with streamlined dialogue and voice.<br />
<br />
If you [WoW Dev Team] are going to continually block UX improvements, then staff needs to have a meeting to discuss what improvements should be made in-house. No one likes a litigious company that can't fix its own inefficacies<br />
There is nothing litigious about this, they didn't even send a C&amp;D. They reached out and told them that they can't allow their IP to be used in this way. And frankly the add-on creators should get permission for this first. It should be obvious that you can't create an unauthorized word-for-word remake of an existing story as a fan project, even if it's for the benefit of that game.</div></div><hr />

Sure they could reuse some of the actors they've used to do the voice overs for a lot of the content that doesn't have it.

Copyrights and patents are really complex, but as far as I know you have to actively defend your Intellectual Property or you will lose copyright on it.<br />
This addon is probably in somewhat of a gray area, but the legal team felt it came to close to violating copyright that they'd rather be safe than sorry.</div></div><hr />

The American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (AFTRA) has renegotiated voice actor contracts about a half dozen times over the past 20 years, specifically in regards to New Media (IE: video games). AFTRA merged with the Screen Actors Guild (SAG) a couple of years ago, forming a power union, with intent to get stronger bargaining power for its members when dealing with studios, be it for TV, films, commercials or voice overs.<br />
<br />
Nowadays, voice actors can have very lucrative careers and studios that want quality dialogue must be willing to pay a quality price. Most won’t want to, so they cut back on voiced dialogue, saving it for special quests or cutscenes. If Blizzard did add more voice acting to their game, I would bet it would be offered at an additional cost to the players.<br />
<br />
ALSO, and this is very important; allowing an add-on like this to exist could create conflict and potential boycotts from or lawsuits by SAG-AFTRA on behalf of voiceover actors.</div></div><hr />

After all, you can only be judged based on what information you already possess, amirite?<br />
<br />
I for one hope they take the route of the author/community and start to voice all quests in the future (with an option to disable it or click past it at least, obviously).<br />
<br />
the other choice is to support the project and asking to review the stuff before it get released but hey hiring a small team to supervise the voice acting done gratis by fans is to much for a company that earn millions. its the same retarded stuff of when they told us if we do this you get a one less raid tier.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Something along the lines of the voice over contract (if the agents had the wherewithal to include it) having a clause about the voice actors being given the first crack at additional dialogue beyond what they were originally contracted for. If they hired them for lines A, B, and C but then allowed other (amateur or unpaid/non-union) talent for lines X, Y, Z then that could be a breach of contract. It’s why union film/TV projects have to have a certain number of union actors (even extras) before they can hire non-union talent.<br />
<br />
Without such a clause (and the only likely way it wouldn’t have been included is if the actors had refused any additional dialogue work or if Blizzard was already intending to go non-union for the extra dialogue) then a lawsuit wouldn’t happen but potential blacklisting/boycotting from the union still likely would</div></div><hr />

Well, you can easily say this by the tone of the acting. There is a priest in the video that has a southern accent and gives a definite feel to the character that Blizzard might not have intended. <br />
<br />
Personally, I think this was an extremely admirable and ambitious project that I wish wasn't taken down. There are so many aspects of WoW that are community driven and it makes the game that much better. However, there is definitely a reason why they don't want this done and a large part of it could be the image or tone. It could also be legal ramifications of voicing certain quests that are rated a certain way because they are text over being voiced. Who knows. However, I am willing to bet it has to do with avoiding legal troubles.</div></div><hr />

They are performing the literature as opposed to creating different warning sounds for abilities. There is a clear differentiation. If you changed the voice of Argus and performed his lines as a difference voice or tone -- I can assure you it falls in the same category. Adding a sound queue to an ability's actuation is vastly different.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The harm is when other, less well meaning people take advantage of that. <br />
<br />
Copyright/IP laws are exceedingly complex, and there are always people looking to take advantages of company that allow a gap. <br />
<br />
Look at it this way, imagine if Blizz loses their control over their IP. Then they effectively lose creative control over WoW, they lose control over what kind of addons are and aren't allowed, and ultimately, they lose the ability to police their own product because it's no longer &quot;their&quot; product. <br />
<br />
There is no such thing as &quot;harmless&quot; trademark infringements, because even if the person who's doing it has no malicious intent, there are plenty of people out there who do.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just adding my bit here - take it or leave it. You hit on the exact issue here they do have a right to protect their IP - BUT they are also OBLIGATED legally to protect it. Every single person working for blizzard might LOVE the voiced quest project and might personally want to allow it to continue, but legally speaking if they are aware of someone infringing on their IP and do nothing to stop it they actually lose their legal standing to fight it the next time. That means that someone else could come along who IS nefarious, who IS giving them monetary concerns, who IS actually doing something bad - and they would be shit out of luck to suddenly step in and stop them. Any court would ask them, &quot;Why now? Why not last time when you did nothing?&quot;<br />
<br />
it's a shame, yes, but part of the way our IP laws work is that they MUST be defended to be maintained. Companies like blizzard simply do not have the legal luxury (no matter how much they might WANT it) to pick and choose when and where to defend their IP and when to allow others to infringe upon it. This is one of those situations in which, no matter how much the folks over at Blizzard might have found this project impressive and awesome, they would be doing major harm to their ability to legally take action against ANYONE infringing on their IP if they were to allow just this one single person to keep on doing it.<br />

Again BS. They actually have the legal luxury to decide who and where can use whatever they own. They CAN say that it is only allowed in this particular case. They don't need to allow it for non-commercial use at all, but yes, they definitively can say that it is allowed, but only here. And even if they allow ONE SINGLE PERSON doing it does not change anything against others who use it without their consent.<br />

<br />
What a terrible company. Actually shutting down work by great fans of the game, yikes. way to persuade even more players you're the bad guys Blizzard.<br />
<br />
This addon was going to spread out your weak ass walls of text for a more immersive questing experience, such as walking into a cave and getting exposition and quest information from the environment and creatures rather than a single questgiver; it wasn't malicious at all. your walls of text are literally available to download anywhere. <br />
<br />
Shame on you Blizzard.<br />
<br />
I completely agree with you here. Voice acted quests in my opinion is the #1 thing WoW is lacking. It is for me the true sign the game is a relic.<br />
It is just pathetic how Blizzard seems to go out of their way to kill fun. They should have just kept silent until they got their shit together and had them voice acted and THEN thanked and apologized. The only thing I can figure is someone who they dropped the hammer on came forward and said &quot;WTF this is not fair, it is a double standard&quot;.</div></div><hr />

P.S.<br />
I love how almost all of you are ignoring the addon's creators post here and just continue to throw poop at Blizzard.<br />
<br />
That's simply because it shows that blizzard is nowadays the worst gaming company, hiding behind sweet words. Sadly after Activision was fused with them, they slowly shown their awful self.<br />
<br />
It's no longer about the addon by itself, it is that blizzard is no longer the &quot;good&quot; gaming company, it's now all about the money. That does not need to be bad. But you don't need to be awful about this.<br />
<br />
If EA for example did something like this for example, the shitstorm would be legendary. But it's blizzard.<br />
<br />
But the addon-author also was a tiny bit stupid by contacting them. In the end if it was there, as long as it isn't misused, maybe they wouldn't have shut it down. But never contact them about it. There was often a silent agreement, as long as it did not get misused, it might not get shut down.<br />
<br />
Still: it would not be necessary. Blizzard can still protect their IP without shutting this project down. That they won't do it shows simply their lazyness.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As far as I am aware, they are not CHANGING anything. I watched a couple videos of the addon and it is just speaking out loud what is being written, NO CHANGES. They are literally speaking out loud what you can read in-game. This is neither re-performing nor changing any impression of the actual text.

<br />
1) It would require money, which Bobby Kotick likes keeping to himself;<br />
<br />
2) It would be excessively strenuous on the five in-house voice-actors Blizz uses for everything because of Point #1.<br />
<br />
1) Not really. It's because voice acting slows the game down a ton. Just try playing Star Wars TOR - you sit there waiting for it. I'm here to play a game, not sit around listening to sub-par acting.<br />
<br />
2) there's been a marked increase in voice acting in the last 3 expacs.<br />
<br />
Listen, it's simple - if you act in a play, which is what this is essentially is, you need the okay from the writer/creators to do so. If I want to put on Hamilton, I need to pay Lin-Manuel Miranda. And if Lin-Manuel Miranda doesn't think my all Scandinavian polka version of Hamilton would be good for his show's reputation, he has every right to tell me no, and if I do it anyway, I open myself to legal action. If he did not, then maybe the next person who comes along and does something less to his liking, say the White Nationalist version of Hamilton, and Mr. Miranda would have a lot less solid legal standing because he let the all-Scandinavian polka version go. <br />
<br />
Period. That's all. It's not that they hate fun, it's not that they're being cheap, it's not because they hate the community, they have intellectual property they want to protect.<br />
<br />
Now, if Blizz ever decides to go back and voice act quests - which I hope they don't because I hate most games that do this, but if they do - I'd hope they get the input from these attempted projects. But that's not up to us, that's Blizz' call, it's their game.</div></div><hr />

It has nothing to do with malice. It has everything to do with Copyright law. IANAL, but actually hold a few patents so I have some professional familiarity with this realm of the law. It goes like this:<br />
<br />
1) Company or individual produces content.<br />
2) Company or individual has delivers the content into the world with a copyright statement on it.<br />
3) Another company or individual uses material that is copyrighted.<br />
<br />
At this point, nothing legally happens. No overarching world government scours the internet for Copyright violations. It's up to Copyright owners to find violations of their Copyright. But when a violation comes to their attention they have two choices:<br />
<br />
1) Issue a Cease &amp; Desist. This can be an official statement from a lawyer, or a personal communication that is either witnessed by an appropriate legal entity, or posted in public forum.<br />
2) Do nothing.<br />
<br />
If they choose Option 1 - they have exerted their legal rights, and can continue to claim Copyright over the material. If they choose Option 2, nothing happens immediately ... right up until they need to go to court to protect their Copyrighted material. And then the opposing lawyer has evidence to be submitted that they have previously chosen not to exercise their rights regarding the material. At which point they lose the Copyright, and now anyone can use the material.<br />
<br />
So while it sucks that the addon creator has lost all of his/her work, Blizzard legally had no choice. You can't run a business where your product is only protected by Copyrights and then not protect them.</div></div><hr />

Ah, I see the Blizzard Defense League has assembled.<br />
<br />
SWTOR made an MMO with a legitimate story that made it feel more RPG than online grindfest. Voice-acting is the standard nowadays and it just shows how dated WoW's content is. No one is forcing you to listen/read if powerleveling your 15th alt is all you care about.<br />
<br />
Nothing in my statement bitched about the legal matter. I'm simply speaking from a logical economic standpoint. Voice-acting costs money. Voicing thousands of quests would cost a pile of money. There's little tangible benefit from going ahead with a full voice-acted overhaul. Plebs don't really care, and as you noted, grinders don't either. So it will never get done.</div></div><hr />

Unfortunately, no. If you violate copyright -before- seeking permission, it could still be used as precedent in court. You need an agreement in place before you redistribute copyrighted material.</div></div><hr />

Have you ever heard the expression &quot;it's not what you say, it's how you say it&quot;. Just because they are reading something aloud does not mean they are not changing the intended feel.

That would imply not a single human being can read out loud a text because no human (other than the author) can possibly read it the way the writer intended it. It's a crap make-shift reason to back this up. People need to wake up and see things the way they are and not the way they get fed with. This is 100% bullshit and has NO reasonable logic behind it.

I think you're missing the point and arguing with yourself. <br />
<br />
Reading the text out-loud or creating software/addon that other people can use that dictates how the creator sees or narrates copyright literature are two different things. <br />
<br />
What are you talking about when you say &quot;people need to wake up and see things the way they are&quot;? How are they? Blizzard openly allows community driven additions to their game and is very supportive of the community. For whatever legal reason, their legal department thinks this particular community driven project is a liability for them. Truthfully, I think it is people that act like you are in response that need to &quot;wake up&quot;. Or perhaps &quot;grow up&quot; would be the more appropriate connotation.<br />
<br />
It's redistribution of copyright material, period.</div></div><hr />

You are still completely missing the point, as if I am arguing about whether they have the &quot;right&quot; or not. The entire problematic regarding this issue is founded in the believe that a recording of a text that has no original performance (no voice actor ever did lines for the text) could possibly be a copyright infringement. If the experience of WoW was fully voiced and the project was recording an alternate version of it then you might have a point.<br />
<br />
First, it's optional, it's nowhere available in the game client nor the official site, hence no customer can claim that it's deluding any experience since you specifically would have to install it yourself. Blizzard allows changes to sound files and even re-interpretation of entire sound cues and voice acting all over the place, go ahead and download any addon I would bet 90% are replacing, re-performing or re-designing all kinds of sounds/texts and icons. There is no logical reason why this is going too far. Changing the sound clues and voice lines of in-game bosses are as much of a redistribution of copyright material as any recorded word by word quest text. (Btw, the answer is none, more on this later)<br />
<br />
I don't believe you think this is logical reasonable with the facts presented as it's literally less of a change than most addons that we have out there. Reading out quest text is not a copyright infringement, I could read out the quest text myself and nothing would happen. The creators are not performing any acts publicly, are not charging money for it and I bet a court would not disallow this modification simply because the game is already allowing these kinds of modification and this would be a simple case of double standards. My educated guess would be that Blizzard knows a project like this would be 100% successful and don't want to look bad why they don't record voice lines themselves. So instead of admitting they don't think it's worth it to voice old/all quests they just play the &quot;copyright&quot; card although it's obviously a hypocritically double standard thrown at us giving that (sound) mods like these has been legal for over a decade just in a less ambitious vision.<br />
<br />
Regarding: &quot;Reading the text out-loud or creating software/addon that other people can use that dictates how the creator sees or narrates copyright literature are two different things.&quot;<br />
<br />
What a whole lot of rubbish, you are telling me no human can simply read out text without dictating his view on the literature? I have no words for this, if that is what you truly believe then we will never have a common ground because that is fundamentally flawed and wrong because it makes any literature worthless by principle if that is what you believe.<br />
<br />
Regarding: &quot;It's redistribution of copyright material, period.&quot;<br />
<br />
It is not, why? Because that would mean you can listen/read the material WITHOUT the official channel, which is the game/server of WoW. You can't, hence it's not redistributed in any form. Blizzard will still get 100% of revenue whether someone listens to the sound mod or if he doesn't, it would not hold up on court. It is a modification like adding &quot;burp&quot; whenever you click on accept on a quest. It's really as simple as that. What they make it seem like is not what it really is, that's why I am telling you to not just swallow what they feed you.<br />
<br />
Elon Musk is right when he proposes laws to be only time limited and then re evaluated over time since governments and corporations alike simply abuse them to do whatever they want. Backwater laws and traditions from 100 years ago surely are fitting, right? ;) (Not saying this in particular is the case)<br />
<br />
Whatever you may answer, have a nice day and hopefully you take something with you and question decisions more often. That's all I can do.</div></div><hr />

So instead of admitting they don't think it's worth it to voice old/all quests they just play the &quot;copyright&quot; card although it's obviously a hypocritically double standard thrown at us giving that (sound) mods like these has been legal for over a decade just in a less ambitious vision.<br />
<br />
Regarding: &quot;Reading the text out-loud or creating software/addon that other people can use that dictates how the creator sees or narrates copyright literature are two different things.&quot;<br />
<br />
What a whole lot of rubbish, you are telling me no human can simply read out text without dictating his view on the literature? I have no words for this, if that is what you truly believe then we will never have a common ground because that is fundamentally flawed and wrong because it makes any literature worthless by principle if that is what you believe.<br />
<br />
Regarding: &quot;It's redistribution of copyright material, period.&quot;<br />
<br />
It is not, why? Because that would mean you can listen/read the material WITHOUT the official channel, which is the game/server of WoW. You can't, hence it's not redistributed in any form. Blizzard will still get 100% of revenue whether someone listens to the sound mod or if he doesn't, it would not hold up on court. It is a modification like adding &quot;burp&quot; whenever you click on accept on a quest. It's really as simple as that. What they make it seem like is not what it really is, that's why I am telling you to not just swallow what they feed you.<br />
<br />
Elon Musk is right when he proposes laws to be only time limited and then re evaluated over time since governments and corporations alike simply abuse them to do whatever they want. Backwater laws and traditions from 100 years ago surely are fitting, right? ;) (Not saying this in particular is the case)<br />
<br />
Whatever you may answer, have a nice day and hopefully you take something with you and question decisions more often. That's all I can do.<br />
<br />
Your argument begs the question among other fallacious retort. I’m not arguing against the addon. In fact, my first post I mention how I wish it wasn’t being dismantled. I don’t necessarily agree with Blizzard’s decisions either. My point is I don’t have to. My argument is that it’s apparent there are legal ramifications Blizzard is not prepared to face by allowing the addon to proceed. Given their history and support for community driven additions to their game — I think their decision should be taken with at least an iota of respect as opposed to the backlash community members such as yourself perpetuate on the forums. <br />
<br />
Speaking of questioning decisions and alternatively, as opposed to using the freedoms Blizzard has given the community as a way to claim they’re being preposterous — perhaps it is better to appreciate their decision while reflecting on the enhanced experience the aforementioned has allowed. <br />
<br />
I’m sorry, I just can’t agree with “you were loose with your guidelines in the past and because you’re not doing it now you’re a terrible company!”.</div></div><hr />

No brainer, they did the right thing to shut this down...even though it would pain the staff given the support and effort gone in to it.</div></div><hr />

Expect if those peeps wanted money because in that case I can understand the Blizzard.<br />

<br />
Around here we call your people: &quot;stupid&quot;. Faith in a profit oriented company.... WTF? I feel NA or Western European education.<br />
<br />
I can disarm your condescending, ill mannered, flat out rude response with a single counter argument.<br />
<br />
Classic Servers<br />
<br />
People have longed for a way to play pre-cataclysm, Vanilla, wow for YEARS and there have been so many Private servers for this. People asked, and asked, and asked and made the desire known. Through community demand, though it had taken years, its finally happening and that's just a singular instance. Allow me to gladly list a few more.<br />
<br />
How about Dark Iron Shaman which were not in the original class line up for that race but was recently added? How about Zandalari having their height re-adjusted after being called out on being way too small? The fact that in the Q&amp;A Blizzard brought up Zandalari Paladins and how that lore is not being ignored, to keep watching what happens? How about the years people, not everyone though, had asked for subraces such as brown Orcs? Hell, lets go back to Pre-Pandaria when every Blizzcon someone asked for Pandaren only to be mocked with &quot;Blizzard would never do that, its just a joke race&quot; only to have Pandaren finally become playable after years of players asking, again I know not &quot;everyone&quot; asked for it but its hard to deny it was not highly requested.<br />
<br />
How about dungeons? Post launch dungeons which went away and Blizzard had made clear their disinterest in doing them because they didn't want to overshadow old dungeon content and raids? People asked and asked for more dungeons and we got it in spades with Legion. People asked for end game dungeon content, the people who wanted alternative to raids, we got the amazing M+ system.<br />
<br />
Yes, at the end of the day you are right that they are a profit driven company and that growth and money is important. Though, as cynical and cold as you want to be, the fact is that they are a company of passionate people who love what they do and who love their game(s). As someone who has had the pleasure of meeting members of the Blizzard team, including Mike Morhaime, back in Blizzcon 2008, someone who has been playing Blizzard games since SC:BW, D2:LoD, and WC2:ToD I can attest to their passion and love for their products. Even to this day, Blizzard makes fine products though I know that fact burns half of the forums up with rage and that people will disagree.<br />
<br />
At the very least, Legion is a good example that even Blizzard want this. Legion is by far one of the most heavily voice acted expansions we have ever had with TONS of flavor dialog while out and about doing our quests, scenarios, dungeons, ect and it was one of the big pushing points for Legion when showed off. With the fact that it was Legion's improvement to voice acted content that actually drove Bellular to start his addon in the first place, the fact that this newer VO addon was attempted even after the shutdown of Bellular's, AND the fact we actually have a text to speech quest addon already on curse, its obvious the interest is out there. There is no way that Blizzard does not see it, I guarantee that the discussion on VO like this is heard by Blizzard.<br />
<br />
I am sorry that you, as well as many others on these forums, have grown so cold and cynical that you have to throw direct and personal insults at people over a game. Fact is, however, that you have no clue what you are talking about and it shows in the quality of your presented argument. Blizzard listens to their community and has proven it time and time again over the years, even though people quickly forget when its convenient and its easy to say that all they care about is money simply because they do something that is not what &quot;you&quot; personally want or feel entitled to. It may not be the expansion after BfA, it may not be in ten expansions after BfA, hell it may never be but the fact is that Blizzard does listen to their fans in more ways than I have time, or text limit, to list all of and even then the words would most likely be wasted. Chances are, with out voices heard, it will some day be a thing. Its not guaranteed, I can't speak for Blizzard nor doe I try to, but given their record its not fully off the table and that much is at the very least fact.<br />
<br />
You are welcome to your opinion, which is what makes public forums so wonderful and at times can create some truly amazing discussions, but I disagree with that close minded view given Blizzards record.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I knew I wouldn't agree with you anyway. At least you acknowledge that you were wrong regarding the redistribution and reading out loud text since you didn't address my points there. :)<br />
<br />
Never mentioned Blizzard is terrible, just saying that Blizzard is having double standards. Read my posts again and you will spot that a couple of times. The addon in question is merely a convenience since it saves you the time to read the text yourself, I could ask my friend or brother to read it out loud for me which is the same. Or like someone else mentioned in this thread, use a text to speech tool which is as neutral as it gets, a robotic emotionless voice. Blizzard would not tell anyone to not do that because it is obviously not a copyright infringement at all. (show me where it says you are not allowed to read out quest text of the game)<br />
<br />
But I suppose you will continue rambling about legal rights and not see the double standard Blizzard is pursuing in this case.<br />
<br />
Again, have a good day, sir. :)</div></div><hr />
