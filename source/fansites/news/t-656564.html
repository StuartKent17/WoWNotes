<br />
Let's all remember that the &quot;good loot&quot; is of equal quality to a PUG-able raid that can be cleared in one night. Even the normal mode rewards share an iLvl with many blue-quality items. ***EDIT: Referring to the 5-man, not the 10/25 ***<br />

Also, if anybody is perturbed that the game is catering to casuals, they have missed the memo. Achievements are the new bosses, and if that is a shocking statement then you are probably an upper-echelon &quot;casual&quot; player in denial.</div></div><hr />

If you are used to doing hard modes in Ulduar you will find this very easy&quot;. Or something like this. They also said the heroic mode will offer a challenge.<br />
<br />
So honestly, I don't get the worlds 72nd best guild whining because they cleared the twin valkyries in an hour. Normal mode isn't meant for those kind of raiders, of course its easy.<br />
<br />
<br />
There is a difference between normal mode and undertuned trashboss. Faction Champions is really undertuned and you can kill him gearing a low stuff and full aoe. It's coliseum, not naxxramas.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Lets all remember that changing your text doesn't make you seem smarter. The loot from the raid from normal mode does not share an Item Level with blue items. Faction champions are a boss for the Trial of the Crusader, which is the 10 and 25 player raid instance.<br />
<br />
The loot that is Naxx quality drops from heroic Trial of the Champion, which is the 5-player instance. The normal mode of Trial of the champion is what drops gear that is item Level 200 which a few blue items share.<br />
<br />
Wrong achievements are not the new bosses, hard modes are. Hard modes are their for the &quot;hardcore&quot; raiders. Though majority of those that consider them hardcore really are not. These are the same people that think 40-mans were hardcore just because they were 40-mans. These are the same people that complain the game is easy, when they haven't finished all hard modes.<br />
<br />
Its easy even for casuals to get many achievements.</div></div><hr />

Besides that, you do *not* need CC. Simply nuke the DPS and then kill the healers. Their heals are easily outdamaged.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Very true. I wasn't clear enough that I was referencing the 5-man. The QQ for that was SOOO yesterday and I never got my cracks in. However...<br />
<br />
Here's at least a couple hundred Rare quality iLvl 200 items. http://www.wowhead.com/?items&amp;filter=qu=3;minle=200;maxle=200#0+1 That is more than a few, but your mileage may vary.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

These are the same people that think 40-mans were hardcore just because they were 40-mans. These are the same people that complain the game is easy, when they haven't finished all hard modes.<br />
Hard modes give hard achievements. Let's not mince words. As it is, the BC hardcore raider will find themselves a casual player if they only have raiding achievements post-3.0. Don't shoot the messenger!<br />
<br />
BTW, colored text doesn't make me seem smarter... just less casual. *Hic!*</div></div><hr />

You fight the 5 champions of the opposite faction in the 5 man instance (along with the black night and some other boss)<br />
<br />
The 5 bosses in the 10/25 man raid are: Beasts of Northrend, Twin Valkries, Lord Jaraxxus, Gormok the Impaler, and Anub Arak <br />

Seems kind of trivial to have the biggest baddies in the game world get taken down by players who arent doing everything they can to maximise their contribution to a raid.<br />
The original idea was not to create a situation where only 0.5% of the population gets to experience the cool content sure, but it was (understandably) that it would take great effort and coordination for a group of players to successfully take down godlike beings.<br />
<br />
As for the loot argument...it's kind of dispiriting to work one's ass off to down hardmodes for loot that becomes not just superceded in the following patch, but completely obsolete.</div></div><hr />

Gotta love these fights in 3.2. Or even Uld/Naxx....remember the good old days of AQ40 where bosses were a challenge?

<br />
I'm not sure if that's in response to my post above yours, but I wasn't asking for a boss that would &quot;stop guilds&quot;. <br />
I do however think that making all raid content puggable is too far in the opposite direction, and that the same bosses with more abilities, 10 achievement points and 1 extra high level loot item is a poor substitute for actual endgame content.<br />
<br />
Oh and, actually some of them are - one of the previous posters in the thread is from a guild with US 2nd algalon 25 kill.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
If you raid just for stuff's glory, you can stop right now. Blizzard won't go back.<br />
<br />
But if you play for the CHALLENGE, maybe could you try some of the HM in heroic mode (remember, PTR just test normal 25 raid, not heroic 25) before crying about the lack of difficulty.</div></div><hr />

Making a reply entirely out of colored text doesn't make you look less casual. It just makes you look like you're desperate for attention.<br />
<br />
<br />
My apologies. I'm accustomed to doing that on guild web site, it just makes it easier to spot things I've written before for future reference. That was really all it was.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It really is not going to change any time soon. They've said on many occassions they regret the old style of raiding and like the new direction. Its just a different game now and crying about it doesn't do any good. The only thing that will change it is when enough people who feel like you stop complaining on forums and just cancel your subscription. Only then they will take notice. Continuing to pay every month = satisfied customer in their eyes.<br />

This should be posted on every forum dedicated to WoW, in game at Dalaran and all major cities, even in the room you play in.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Unless everyone involved has done the bosses by virtue of being in a decent guild, Uld is not puggable past Hodir (assuming he's the first keeper you go for), in 10 or 25 man versions.<br />
<br />
Anything more complex than &quot;run away from giant glowy bad thing or you'll die and maybe we'll hit enrage&quot; is a cockblock for true pugs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Not sure what server your on but on both my alliance and horde server we've pugged all of Ulduar save Algalon in 10man with a few &quot;lawl hardmodes&quot;, unsure how far the 25man pugs get as I've never bothered joining one.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jervaise</div><div class="date">2009-07-13, 03:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Greetings, I'm a long time reader but I had to register to post the following:<br />
<br />
<br />
Introduction:<br />
<br />
I am totally ok with the changes and where the game is directed to. I myself am quite good about adapting, and given that I'm playing WoW on my priest for almost the entire time wow was available in Europe, I can say that I have been successful. <br />
<br />
I don't mind new encounters, I don't mind new methods to gain gear, I don't mind having new designs perhaps not as high quality as I have expected. I don't mind any other concern in the forums (both mmochamp and bliz) and I think that the game will still be enjoyable and playable. <br />
<br />
I don't see a problem with people having to spend less time to gear up to a decent level either, because our server isn't that crowded and we do usually lack dedicated players to complete our raids.<br />
<br />
We have downed vezax and mimiron with 4 healers (1 off 1 alt) we have cleared up to yogg saron in 25 man in 9 raiding nights with usually 17-22 players and we are also server 5th yogg saron killer (edit: 10 man that one is). <br />
<br />
I'm fine with everything and I love this game..<br />
<br />
<br />
BUT...<br />
<br />
why do we have to have a PvP oriented fight in PvE again? I.. simply.. hate.. pvp! I have to be given a choice in between playing against other players in unpredictible and perhaps amusing and fun fight == and == a strategical, group work + planning + perfect execution requiring encounters. <br />
<br />
I am not looking down to the PvP aspect of the game, I know a lot of players including my friends enjoy it and it seems to be a very fun and exciting feature for those who enjoy it.<br />
<br />
But I do not want to have a PvP oriented (come on, it's a copy from real players to AI... that can't be real!) battle amongst PvE dungeon designs!<br />
<br />
Sorry for the wall of text, thanks for reading. This is my only concern now.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">harod</div><div class="date">2009-07-13, 01:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's not actually pvp. You are fighting npc's. They just don't have normal aggro mechanics and they have the same abilities as players. Can't handle that concept? QQ more.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Deathcold</div><div class="date">2009-07-13, 01:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm not sure if that's in response to my post above yours, but I wasn't asking for a boss that would &quot;stop guilds&quot;. <br />
I do however think that making all raid content puggable is too far in the opposite direction, and that the same bosses with more abilities, 10 achievement points and 1 extra high level loot item is a poor substitute for actual endgame content.<br />
<br />
Oh and, actually some of them are - one of the previous posters in the thread is from a guild with US 2nd algalon 25 kill.<br />
<br />
<br />
Just to be very clear, those called &quot;hardcore players&quot; in uber guilds that can get everything down, dont want tunned bosses to challenge themselfs. Looks like the lvl of items on hardmodes dosent compensate the trouble, they need droops that can faceroller every noob in 3 sec on pvp.<br />
In the end it is all about loot, forget the challenge and skill... its all about loot!!!</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">chefjay</div><div class="date">2009-07-26, 02:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;hardcore&quot; - a WoW concept in which players are willing to put up with more to get more. Long hours, people they wouldn't usually associate with, listening to someone else's every command, agreeing to favoritism, loot unfairness, and other unsavory things.<br />
<br />
I used to be one of those guys and gals. We farmed Naxx when it was a 40 man instance, we toasted our buns in BWL when there was no such thing as a strategy guide and anything we learned, we learned from sitting down in front of dozens of pages of printed out combat logs and screenshots.<br />
<br />
With that came perks - having one of the very first Thunderfury on my Warrior, forging Sulfuras for our Pally, and the aahs and oohs of complete strangers when I spent time in the AH or on the bridge in IF.<br />
<br />
Then I opened a restaurant and another. I got some awards. I hired more and more people. And the economy went down the drain. All not very conducive to raiding every night for six hours. Still, there's nothing &quot;casual&quot; about spending four hours every other day, or more, on one activity. Really. It's not &quot;casual&quot;, it's pretty dedicated.<br />
<br />
According to some posters, I am terribad. I know nothing about raiding, nothing about mechanics, nothing about leading a raid, nothing about theorycraft. Why? Because I don't have the time or 24 other, equally bored, friends. Yes, yes, I suck, right? Bad player, and all that.<br />
<br />
I also, apparently suck at PvP, because my Rank 14 GM Warrior only has a 2100 Arena rating. Damn casuals and their inability to play the game, damn casuals and their asking for loot handouts for stuff that &quot;hardcore&quot; pro-players worked so hard to obtain.<br />
<br />
Here's an idea - maybe, just maybe, it's time to be less focused on what your game character wears and more focused on how you, the player, obtained it. Just because every Druid gets epic flight form for free, now, doesn't diminish my having gotten mine the hard way, wiping on Anzu with a massively undergeared group in the first week of it being available. WoW won't be around forever, at which point all those shiny epics are, well, gone. The fun I had, the people I met, and the experiences we had together, won't ever go away.<br />
<br />
So why not stop complaining about others getting some pixels and being proud of having shown true skill in working with the same friends for four years or longer? Sure, you won't get a bragging-capable loot item or achievement for it, but who needs to brag about this stuff? For brags we have that real life thingie :)</div></div><hr />
