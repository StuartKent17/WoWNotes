I hope not.<br />
<br />
Any mounted combat in this game has been meh. Look at the Crusader stuff back in Wrath.<br />
<br />
Leveling them up makes them stronger and helps progress the story.<br />

True.<br />
<br />
just trying to figure out how mounted equipment won't just be visual.<br />
<br />
Maybe we'll have an upgrade system, minus sprint and speed, like ESO has?<br />
<br />
Unlock 4 additional bag slots on your mount at upgrade levels 25, 50, 75 and 100?!<br />

You mean kind of like how when I bought Heavensward for FF14 I had to finish all the post-2.0 content in order to meaningfully engage with the expansion and so never really got to? As much as I like having flying, it's not content, it's a reward for going through the content that's there. Just leveling from 110 to 120 is a grind you need to do in order to engage in a lot of the BfA content. That's different from almost no other game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Aside from that, i don't see why i should put in the effort to grind those Heart of Azerite levels if all of these abilities will go down the shitter with the end of BfA. I certainly won't grind out this crap if this whole system will be meaningless like the Artifact Weapon system.</div></div><hr />

Not only that, but there's a LOT of grinding in FF14 that isn't remotely fun, so acting like FF14 did it great and WoW just sucks at it is kind of baseless.</div></div><hr />

After being conviced for a while that they have something pretty &quot;HUGE&quot; to offer, it's kind of a let down. I feel really sorry for them, as I know it required a lot of effort. The moment I have heard that the Horde and the Alliance will need to help some reputation guys the very moment we appear in Nazjatar, it felt like an Argus scenario.<br />

Legion gave WoW a different direction, and I wouldn't say it's a good one. Damn, what a disappointment.</div></div><hr />

Nah because they didn't take 14 years to work it out. :)<br />

Seriously if it takes you 14 years to work out something a dev did in like a year or two that's just amusing imo.<br />

The people here bitching came here prepared to bitch even before the deep dive started. They don't want to see the game succeed because in their sad, lonely minds they've already decided the game is trash and that nothing Blizzard could ever do would change that. Or that the game is trash simply because Blizzard won't SPECIFICALLY implement or take out XYZ. <br />
<br />
The guy here claiming there are other MMOs out there that balance &quot;grind&quot; and &quot;fun&quot; better than WoW, for example, is just cringe-worthy. ALL MMOs are grindy. That is literally what an MMO is. I think what you really want is some shit console single player game where everything is handed to you for little to no time investment or effort in an extremely linear manner.<br />
<br />
The most hilarious part to me about that specific guy is that WoW Classic, the thing which 80% of the nostalgiatards here are jizzing over, was literally the most grindy, unrewarding state of the game WoW has ever seen. Yeah, have fun grinding out an entire set of fire resistant gear over months and months just to be able to kill a boss that only has 3 abilities but is &quot;difficult&quot; simply because his health and fire damage are over-tuned to emulate &quot;challenge.&quot;</div></div><hr />

Except...you did say it? You've said it in multiple threads, that WoW is basically doing catch-up and a poor job of it. A history of crapping on the game doesn't mean you suddenly get to dodge that history because you didn't mention it in a thread. They made a change that you think should've been done sooner. Probably better to say &quot;good job&quot; and that you're still not interested instead of some variation of &quot;GOOD GOD IT TOOK FOREVER&quot;. WoW has its issues (and they are many) and needs some QoL and engagement improvements aplenty, but that's true of every other MMO. So...</div></div><hr />

How was Classic unrewarding? In fact, I could argue it was one of the MOST rewarding times in the games history... Not just from an item/skill/costmetic reward stand point obviously... But from a satisfaction stand point. You felt rewarded every time you leveled up, but most of it was from the journey it took to get there.</div></div><hr />

It was unrewarded where it matter, loot. 2-3 items for 40 people was SO MUCH FUN. And unrewarding in your spec performing well if you weren't &quot;meta&quot;.<br />

They had competition before they even launched. WoW just did better and then more games entered the fray. All of them have messed things up along the way. FF14 (as an example) has had some massive missteps. Guild Wars did some fantastic work, but still had its failings. Competition has always been there, but the point of competition is not matching each other, it's finding niche. WoW fills a broad role. Most of the other games started with their niche role and found ways to draw others in. Which, go figure, is what they've done with WoW over the years. 8.2 should have some aspects of that, but it's not going to have many. What'll 8.2 bring that'll draw in people who've left? Doesn't look like much at all. But it does add more for the folks who're still playing, and that's kiiiiiind of more important.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thousands and thousands of people disagree with you. Different strokes for different folks. You call it a forced grind, I call it an RPG with an awesome story, and a feeling of progressing your character. It's not rose colored glasses, considering I've played on private servers for years, and enjoy it til this day. I can't wait for classic to launch and do it all AGAIN.<br />
<br />
Why is it that people feel the need to dump on something they dont like, that has no impact on the thing they do like? You realize classic and retail are not mutually exclusive right?<br />

I actually think the pre-launch skill point system had more innate reward for playing than the talent points did, and yet both systems were crap overall. Talent points let you make a tailored character when you really wanted to, but by the same token it let you be a completely wasted raid slot during early raiding. Vanilla's entire reward for the leveling process was itself and the opening of the gateway to later content. The accomplishment of hitting 60 was, for a massive number of people, a sense of relief that that portion of the grind had completed. Some people liked both the accomplishment and the relief, which is why it's still looked at fondly. But QoL wise, the game was pretty terrible compared to at least Legion. And the post-60 grind (especially, say, PvP), was downright unhealthy from any objective viewpoint.<br />
<br />
On the subject of story...I can't say it was an overly fantastic one. They weren't a company swelling with fantastic writing staff. There were some gems, but a good portion boiled down to &quot;_____ has been _____ our _____. Please help by ____ the ____ and bringing ____ to ____.&quot; Go figure, that's still a lot of the story, but there's gems slightly more often now. I can't think of a single zone that really wowed me from a story perspective at launch. Especially not from a grand overarching story point. The only ones that came close? The multi-zone frustrating ones that a lot of people never even did and didn't open up until you were in the latter 1/3 of the leveling process.</div></div><hr />

man i love you post.<br />
And you right, ppl claim that Classic wasnt griding are plain stupid since it was the most griding point on wow proabbly, hell still rememeber some rep back them good lord. <br />
Plus from GW2 to SW to FF14 every mmo have grind on it. <br />
Ppl that been playiong wow forever and change to a new game claim that everything is better bc everything is new. <br />
But you right mmochamp become a QQing forum, ppl here come to QQ even if the game get better.<br />
And not make me speak about fucking Talent point on classic, bullshit was rp, since if you where a pvper or pver you have a preset talent tree for max your dps. If not you wont be getting into a good raid or good pvp group.</div></div><hr />

Vanilla's entire reward for the leveling process was itself and the opening of the gateway to later content. The accomplishment of hitting 60 was, for a massive number of people, a sense of relief that that portion of the grind had completed. Some people liked both the accomplishment and the relief, which is why it's still looked at fondly. But QoL wise, the game was pretty terrible compared to at least Legion. And the post-60 grind (especially, say, PvP), was downright unhealthy from any objective viewpoint.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm not saying Vanilla was perfect, dont get me wrong. The pvp ranking system was trash, most will agree. But it captured the feeling of an RPG, and the progression of your character. When you finished and hit 60, you felt rewarded simply for the fact of completing it. It was the end of one journey, and the start of the next. Not to mention, on top of all that, the games systems at the time encouraged you to interact with other players along the way, so by the time you finished that first journey of leveling, you had made a group of friends to keep doing things with.<br />
<br />
Classic wasn't great because of its game systems, although some were better than what we have now, and vice versa. But it was the community aspect that made the game great. Now a days, you can level a toon from 1 - 120 on a new server, and not meet anyone of any significance to yourself by the time you finish. You just queue for everything, never say a word to them, and then hit max level to queue again. It's sad, and its one of the things i miss most about current WoW was a sense of community, and specifically server communities.</div></div><hr />

I mean no shit. Did not fighting Arthas change the future? Or Garrosh? Had we lost then we would have basically been destroyed for the most part.<br />
<br />
Not really much. If Arthas would have won, deathwing would have killed him a few months later and the aspects would still get the dragon soul and kill deathwing. <br />
<br />
Garrosh would try to conquer the world, but lets be realistic. He would find himself at the blackhand position, which would force him to a other world or reconsider his plans.</div></div><hr />

If your sole goal is to constantly get loot, retail is fantastic for it. Because of titan forging etc, you've always got loot to chase. You get what... 6-8 pieces of loot per raid boss for a 20 man raid? Plus loot coins each week, plus m+ cache, etc.<br />

Theres more loot options now than at any point in the games history. Stop contradicting yourself.</div></div><hr />

<br />
thats a vastly single minded point of view, you can easily completely avoid lfd/lfr. you can use LFG, you can talk to people just fine etc. sounds more like a YOU problem. I leveled pretty much by myself in vanilla besides a few times and you get pretty much the same social interaction joining a guild and progressing. LFR is not progression lol<br />

Thousands and thousands of people disagree with you. Different strokes for different folks. You call it a forced grind, I call it an RPG with an awesome story, and a feeling of progressing your character. It's not rose colored glasses, considering I've played on private servers for years, and enjoy it til this day. I can't wait for classic to launch and do it all AGAIN.<br />
<br />
Why is it that people feel the need to dump on something they dont like, that has no impact on the thing they do like? You realize classic and retail are not mutually exclusive right?<br />

The point of an RPG isnt solely loot... But like I said, different strokes for different folks. If all you're playing for is loot, then retail is in a great state for you.<br />
<br />
you realize its people like you who constantly shit on live right? the story in vanilla was complete trash, terrible itemization, boring rotations, slow character gameplay etc lol i loved it back in the day too but i dont completely ignore all the massive problems it had. and because i think MMOs should never go back in time to please some people stuck in the past</div></div><hr />

I'm still confused by this position. I leveled 3 characters to 60 during Vanilla, and I only started sometime after Naxx hit. (I stopped playing before beta ended, to be clear.) I didn't encounter a single person I would've wanted to continue running stuff with until I hit 60 the second time. For the most part, I did my entire 1-60 each time without much involvement at all. Not for lack of trying...just people were about as terrible as they are today...there were just more of them I had to deal with in order to find anyone. The whole &quot;sense of community&quot; thing is pretty subjective. I was on a high pop server and oh man, you could not convince me that the community was great back then. More intertwined, definitely. Better? Definitely a place for debate.<br />
<br />
As a point of note on the whole &quot;the community was better&quot; thing: Horde (or even Alliance) pulling Kazzak to Stormwind was people being UTTERLY TERRIBLE. Guilds blocking each other (even same faction) from completing world bosses was UTTERLY TERRIBLE. It didn't make the community better. Trading was underhanded. People were offensive. They came together now and then, and people knew each other more, but it's not like everyone was walking around with etiquette and consideration.</div></div><hr />

Wrath was the perfect state for loot.<br />

FFXIV does loot perfectly as well IMO<br />

Nowadays you can't AIM for anything, player agency has been completely stripped and you're left with nothing but RNG. WF and TF creates a situation where you can't reach BiS anymore, and that's what a lot of people played for.<br />

BiS slot is boring though, you can still do it though if you get TF of everything but just aim for the base ones and think of the TFs as bonuses, you can definitely still target though a raid boss still has a chance to drop an item just as always lol game has always been RNG theres just a bit more now</div></div><hr />

Yes, its so much fun to kill a boss over and over and never see a piece yourself, but the one time it drops it goes to someone who doesn't want it but it's 5 ilvls higher then what they're wearing so they can't do shit about it, such a great game.<br />

Yeah, I think the primary perspective people ever had was about guilds or a group of friends they'd made, and ignored all the questionable or unpleasant things otherwise. Even private servers are much more tightly-woven communities than Vanilla ever was, so using it as an example is impossible. Barrens chat (the quintessential community example) isn't exactly notable for its welcoming atmosphere so much as all the memes, trolling, and arguments.</div></div><hr />

The argument is usually something to the effect that since WF and TF can get a piece much higher than that, it's the only loot that matters, and since it's RNG, loot is trash. The idea of the system was supposed to be a lucky find that made you enjoy it more, but the result was that base gear was disappointing. It's a downside of the system, but it has more to do with outlook than it does the system itself. Striving for BiS in an MMO is impossible anyway, since a new tier or expansion will invalidate all you have. All you get is that snapshot that shows all the work you did.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A lot of that comes down to removal of ML for full guild groups. Yes some guilds abused it, but it really wasn't that widespread, a lot of the complaints came from (probably anyway) people who didn't read or understand loot rules before joining a guild.<br />
<br />
No we're not trying to hurt you by not giving you loot for a bit unless no one needs it, but you can blame guild hoppers for it being required.<br />

Right you can have a plan to aim for item with some stat that you want, but going for BoS is bullshit you right, in any MMO. <br />
<br />
I mean right now if anyone is aiming for items that are over 415 to kill Mythic boss, are just bc they have the illution they need that hight item level.<br />
<br />
you can work all the way up to Jaina Mythic with 415 gear. and kill her. WF and TF make it so you get more loot even if you already full with the item cap that is 415 right now.</div></div><hr />

I'm not gonna deny the &quot;always more to do&quot; part being a little exhausting, but I don't think I ever felt like there was a way to feel &quot;done&quot; with a character at any point in the game's history. You could get all BiS, but there was still more to do. Still prep work for the next tier or expansion. The problem really is that some people DID feel just done with their character, which made them want to play less or want more to do, so as the game went on they made it possible to have more to do or another upgrade to get, and it bothered some of the folks who DID want to actually be done. There's no real way to fix it for both sides, but at least this way the people who like continuing to play are less likely to get that feeling of &quot;But why would I bother?&quot;<br />
<br />
It's not a best of both worlds by a longshot. But it also has the benefit that getting a really good piece from one tier and having no luck whatsoever in the next doesn't leave you feeling for months like you're getting crapped on by the game. I spent months trying to get a trinket in ICC before my raid group fell apart. Didn't get it until Mists since I unsubbed for most of Cata. Still had a ton to do beyond that trinket. And that's something I couldn't really say about earlier WoW.</div></div><hr />

You could get all BiS, but there was still more to do. Still prep work for the next tier or expansion. The problem really is that some people DID feel just done with their character, which made them want to play less or want more to do, so as the game went on they made it possible to have more to do or another upgrade to get, and it bothered some of the folks who DID want to actually be done. There's no real way to fix it for both sides, but at least this way the people who like continuing to play are less likely to get that feeling of &quot;But why would I bother?&quot;<br />
<br />
It's not a best of both worlds by a longshot. But it also has the benefit that getting a really good piece from one tier and having no luck whatsoever in the next doesn't leave you feeling for months like you're getting crapped on by the game. I spent months trying to get a trinket in ICC before my raid group fell apart. Didn't get it until Mists since I unsubbed for most of Cata.<br />

Honestly I never had an issue with the 6 ilvl warforge that they used to have. It actually felt like cool bonus. Titanforging has gotten a bit silly though. It leads to &quot;if it's not TF its not worth it&quot; mentality.</div></div><hr />

A lot of us criticize the current state of the game because we WANT it to be good, we don't want it to fail, we want it to go back to being our main game. I mean yea there's people out there who live with a stick up their ass and are negative about everything, but a lot of us just want to get the game back to a state where it's gaining and not losing.</div></div><hr />

I was kinda meh on the WF system from the start. But it did feel better than the &quot;my LFR item just rolled at post-Mythic level!&quot; issue. Having said that, I think if the system was only an increase of other stats (like leech or speed) instead of straight up across-the-board power, I think it'd be less troubling. It'd also slow down the item level creep issue that's still going on after the item level squish. There's so many other systems in the game now that the reliance on massive gear upgrades has become a hamstring issue.</div></div><hr />

Eh shuffle some things around and it's not really that much bigger overall between 8.1 to 8.2 then in the past expansions, they just packed a lot into 8.2 which makes it feel like a ton.<br />

Legion had it's perks, the legendaries were great, the artifact system was pretty ok. <br />

compare with what patch 8.2 isnt big????<br />

8.2 is overall a decent size, but together 8.1-8.2 is about the same size as 7.1-7.2 The raid isn't really even included in all that because that probably won't release til 8.2.5.<br />
<br />
And I think we still have 1-2 less raid bosses then Legion at this point.</div></div><hr />

This. Fanboys can't seem to accept that you can still care about something due to the good memories and maybe not want it to turn into utter horsecrap. Well technically that already happened, but things can still turn back. Legion was a huge improvement after WoD in every regard beside class design.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">McNeil</div><div class="date">2019-04-11, 07:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I like most of what I've seen. The problem is that while this patch does seem huge, the same problem might occur where most content just isn't fun or somewhat rewarding to do like the game is in its current state. I'm sure that a lot of it will also be gated a lot. I like the look of both Nazjatar and Mechagon, the new mounts (I wanna ride that IT from South Park the way its meant to be), a return to some WC3 naga units, exploring Crestfall, having heroic warfronts feel much closer to an actual WC3 experience (I'm still expecting a lot of bad experiences when doing it with randoms).<br />
<br />
Basically if I would ask if people liked 7.2 or 8.2 more by the end of 8.2, I'm sure that a lot of people will say 7.2 solely for the mage tower, while the rest of the patch was really bad (the new quest chain, uninspired island, the raid was received negatively). So I was expecting 8.2 to deliver soemthing similiar, yet it seems more like a lot of fluff thrown together and call it a giant patch. But we'll see how it shapes up.</div></div><hr />

Which means they're planning 8.2 release out further then we think probably. We're probably looking at July to coincide with XIV's expansion release.<br />

Just to note, the size of Argus is roughly as large as a medium-sized zone, there was a raid and dungeon associated with it, and there was a semi-small story that went through all of it. Aspects of 8.2 might be larger, but it's hard to know just from the preview. Odds are, it'll be pretty close to on-par with Argus. I'll hold out for the PTR before I really gauge relative scope.</div></div><hr />

Well, this isn't the last patch (unless blizz goes full retard), but I'm betting anything in the last patch will be much smaller, probably broken shore sized. They have a habit of shuffling things around.<br />

<br />
But is it &quot;The Patch That Saved World Of World Of Warcraft&quot;™? <br />
<br />
For current players. Maybe. Maybe so. <br />
<br />
Will it bring back players, bring in newbs? I'm skeptical. <br />

But...looks pretty solid. Let's see how this works out for them, Cotton. <br />

And please...let Feasel be the Face Of WoW. He's so much better than Ion. And No Lore™ needs to be a thing from now on. <br />

I laughed at Ashran. Holinka just can't let that one go, lol. Hey, they brought back Wintergrasp, you knew this was coming, and Tol Barad in the next patch, if it's not in there already.

i leave the raid out, since most big patch from blizz are asociete with a Raid. <br />
<br />
But so far 7.2 was Argus 2 maps full with WQ, and if i rememeber corrctly 4 quest. that all. and the dungoen. Outside that didnt add much more content.<br />
<br />
8.2 outside the zones dungon and raid, is adding alot more quest. more content outside questing too. <br />
<br />
so 8.2 is looking bigger that 7.2 <br />
<br />
On the other hand 7.1 was ALOT bigger that 8.1. 1<br />

I agree, I got all of them except fury warrior cause I wrongly assumed i had done it, didn't realize it until i started leveling it in bfa and went to the transmogifier...<br />
<br />
I'd like to see some sort of scaling done if they every do them again (such as all items will be down scaled to the item level the challenge was originally designed for). Had a lot of fun on the first 10 or so I did cause it was decently challenging (although varied a lot depending on spec) with the gear available, but just a tier later they were trivial and possible to one-shot with a spec you had no previous experience playing.</div></div><hr />

Pretty much every raid tier last 6 months (Except for the the final tiers, which tend to be much longer). A few exceptions for some smaller raids, such as EN, but its a pretty damn accurate.<br />
<br />
<br />
BoD released on Jan 22 for US servers. Add 6 months to that and you get July 22nd. That gives them a perfect opportunity to launch 8.2 on July 2nd and have the raid come out 3 weeks later for the 6 month target line.</div></div><hr />

Them releasing this two boss raid could possibly throw a wrench in that though.<br />

BTW September 5 for Uldir to Jan 22nd for Dazar'alor is 20 weeks, aka 5 months, not 6. So back your plan up a month. All of legion was around 5 months too, not 6</div></div><hr />

Something is happening with him Rexxar is present during the warcampaing and he comment that someone need to hear what is happening, and that mean Thrall. <br />
<br />
So probable he will be showing, doubt they want to spoiler that right now.</div></div><hr />

Because I very specifically remember the overwhelming amount of hate and anger towards the RNG mess that legendary items were for the first year and a half of that expansion. Funny how people tend to remember the end of Legion when they were actually in a decent spot and completely forget the mess they were at launch.<br />
<br />
You're confusing using legendaries, to obtaining them.<br />

I'm seeing a steady decline of discussion over WoW in general. A preview like this in years past would have gotten hundreds of pages in forums about it, now, it's lackluster in all of the usual places. Reddit threads are pretty small, compared to the past, response here is smaller.<br />
<br />
Belullar was onto something talking about community participation rates. The amount of people engaging is dwindling significantly.</div></div><hr />

It does look great--I'm amazed at how much stuff they're putting in and all the incentive and systems that encourage gameplay. I have a good feeling about how the neck may turn out since it looks like it'll be more like an artifact weapon and those were sweet.</div></div><hr />

I’m actually sad we are not using legion’s class halls, they looked amazing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So, Azshara will push Nazjatar out of the sea just to destroy a few ships and sacrifice her immense advantage, allowing us to kick her ass easily ?<br />
<br />
I'm failing to see the point, I hope there is more to that than just a dumb move from another dumb villain though. We'll see with the cinematics (if any).</div></div><hr />
