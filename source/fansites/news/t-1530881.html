True, that. <br />
<br />
So when will the bike(s) be in-game? I'm guessing both will be despite this little &quot;contest&quot;...</div></div><hr />

The threads killed it for me. I mean, can the horde one even be considered a bike? I am kinda upset that the winner wont be in until the expansion. I highly doubt it would take that long to create the models. Over all, not surprised by the results at all. Even though it looks worse then the loser imo. However, they both are bad.</div></div><hr />

Everyone knows there are far more horde then there are alliance players. It would be the same thing as going to England and having people vote on whether they would rather have and enlish person as there monarch or some random asian guy. The English will always win. Seriously blizzard do contests that we get to vote on that don't involve faction choices.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Avoiding spoilers:<br />
This &quot;contest&quot; was doomed for PR from the start, though. If Horde wins, Alliance could again say favoritism (I'd personally agree). If Alliance wins, it would easily be seen for &quot;there, see? We don't favor the Horde, honest!&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Face it, Metzen, the Thrall worship and blatant Horde cheering from Blues has pretty much destroyed any sense of Alliance faction pride. You'll have to do a lot better than a tank-tread silver locust and Varian posturing like a jackass to reverse that.</div></div><hr />

Since when? Alliance has always outnumbered Horde. They just didn't vote.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xezar</div><div class="date">2014-06-05, 05:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok so Metzen was playing double agent and sabotaging the alliance bike, I can put down the pitchfork and torch I guess. Da Horde be strong ya?<br />
<br />
In all seriousness though, the &quot;contest&quot; is a farce, there's no way they're going to piss off half the playerbase with mount inequality. Horde bike might make it in first to the game, but I fully expect the meh alliance one to eventually be put in, otherwise the QQs will never end from them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They can't put a faction specific mount in game, give it to one, and the other side gets nothing, especially in times where horde is kinda too many, and alliance, kinda, isn't.<br />
<br />
So, both mounts will end up in game, for sure.<br />
Or, they will have to redo the bike, in order for it NOT to look like Garrosh Hellscream, and to make it unifaction. Which can be done only by making a 3rd one :)<br />

This was a waste of money and time from Blizzard. There is no way they'd think the Horde fans would be idle during something that turned into FREE MOUNT for loudest faction!<br />
This is really the only answer to the whole thing, it was a waste of money and time. I don't mind that the Horde won at all, I have a Horde Character, play on him regularly, at least for professions, but still, lots of money, lost.

I would like to think so. They should totally give the Horde bike for free but still put the alliance bike in to pay for. Either in game currency or real money wont matter to me I still want my Alliance bike. It would be a waste to not put the Alliance bike in the game, especially if they sell it for real money cause that's still a money maker for the 40% of people that voted for the Alliance bike.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They can't put a faction specific mount in game, give it to one, and the other side gets nothing, especially in times where horde is kinda too many, and alliance, kinda, isn't.<br />
<br />
So, both mounts will end up in game, for sure.<br />
Or, they will have to redo the bike, in order for it NOT to look like Garrosh Hellscream, and to make it unifaction. Which can be done only by making a 3rd one :)<br />
#spoileralert ï»¿<br />
They may, they may not, maybe they will just give the Alliance a different mount to keep the mount count equal but stick to their Az Choppers guns.<br />
Maybe they will stop treating the factions like little kids at their birthdays and stop giving both presents to keep the peace.<br />
<br />
Mannoroth's tusks were a symbol in Orgrimmar before Garrosh was warchief, he just repurposed them. Spikes and the color red have also always been symbols in the horde.</div></div><hr />

You say that, but they are tuning Mythic SoO for a 6 week time frame of raiding (6 attempts to kill Mythic Garrosh), that's also a massive undertaking and would be in the same boat as not putting in the chopper IE: A Waste of Resources</div></div><hr />

For example, when cataclysm launched, horde were +2 on available mounts (goblin trikes vs. worgen running wild) but that was eventually fixed when they introduced the Gilnean mountain horses. <br />
<br />
I appreciate the horde vs. alliance faction pride aspect of this &quot;competition&quot; but I really wish they had decided when it was all said and done that both factions would get a in-game mounts based on the designs, perhaps with a staggered release so that the winning faction would have theirs weeks/months before the losing side.</div></div><hr />

1. Most of the bitching about it being over is just because of Twitter Feeds, if you don't have a twitter, you don't know the pain, constant emails about Azeroth Choppers for close to a month.<br />

If all orcs = horde<br />
Then all humans = alliance<br />
<br />
And if that is true, then:<br />
Vanilla<br />
TBC <br />
Wrath<br />
and<br />
Cata<br />
<br />
Were all Alliance expansion, and if we are using that logic, then so are MoP and WoD, because in both of those Orcs are portrayed as the bad guys. Who wants to associate with racist scum?</div></div><hr />

I agree with you there, my issue isn't exactly with who won. If this was intended for a serious poll, my arguement still stands, it's not so much who won for me, it's how the polls were handled.<br />
If they were any at all serious about a poll in which players of WoW could vote, they could have easily put in systems not to cheese the system. It's not extremely hard to do so.</div></div><hr />

They said everone gets it, but you can only use it on a character of the winning faction.<br />
<br />
First, we want to make it clear that players globally will be able to vote for their favorite faction bikeâeither Alliance or Horde. Second, the bike that receives the most votes will then be made into a faction-specific-only mount and be available FREE to all players (usable when playing characters of the winning faction, of course). Your vote will be very important and could just be the one that lands your favorite faction a shiny new mount. If you havenât watched the trailer yet, check it out here and stay tuned to Azerothchoppers.com for more details!</div></div><hr />

WoW will turn 10 this year. Makes sense now?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I beleive that there are people out there who really did not beleive in this bullshit...<br />
<br />
They can't put a faction specific mount in game, give it to one, and the other side gets nothing, especially in times where horde is kinda too many, and alliance, kinda, isn't.<br />
<br />
So, both mounts will end up in game, for sure.<br />
Or, they will have to redo the bike, in order for it NOT to look like Garrosh Hellscream, and to make it unifaction. Which can be done only by making a 3rd one :)<br />

In a contest there's winners and there's losers. It's never cool to lose but you suck it up and move on.

Hey, you can do whatever the hell you want to.

Ehh no read the post you where talking about <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes there are more Alliance players, but more Horde players are rooted in internet culture than Alliance players. That is why you see all of this 'for the Horde' on the WoW forums all the time and you never see 'for the Alliance' and that is why Horde won. The Horde are more passionate about their faction and in an internet setting they're sure to let you know that.&quot;<br />

Just look at all the popular streamers etc most of them are horde and horde players generally have more of a presence on sites like this and on the web at least for US players. Although i think if it was just EU voting alliance might of won, it seems to me its more the us realms where alliance isn't as strong in numbers or presence online. I think that is partly due to all the popular horde streamers.</div></div><hr />

First, we want to make it clear that players globally will be able to vote for their favorite faction bikeâeither Alliance or Horde. Second, the bike that receives the most votes will then be made into a faction-specific-only mount and be available FREE to all players (usable when playing characters of the winning faction, of course). Your vote will be very important and could just be the one that lands your favorite faction a shiny new mount. If you havenât watched the trailer yet, check it out here and stay tuned to Azerothchoppers.com for more details!<br />

<br />
Do you have an actual proof that 25%~ are &quot;plastic fans, just there for the racial&quot;?<br />
<br />
This vote was FOR A BIKE, not for a faction. The faction vote is already won by the alliance.<br />
<br />
Hence why alliance players voted for the horde bike, and vice verse.<br />
what im saying is that horde players will take everything serious even if their bike was a pile of shit they will still vote for horde because they hate anything alliance or are you going to deny that? everyone knows horde fans are more passionate then alliance, many alliance players don't even care about the faction or take pride but there are sum and thats not enough to even compete with the horde...</div></div><hr />

I find it really funny that anything Blizzard does is often proof that Blizzard has favoritism towards the Horde. If Blizzard would have rigged the contest to allow Alliance to win, then later released the Horde bike (like many suspect they will do with Alliance bike), thousands of Alliance fanboys would have bitched saying that they only did it because Blizzard favours Horde.</div></div><hr />

Hey, if you are too dense to realize that people don't actually have to do a fucking thing for you, and if they do something, maybe treating them like a complete pile of shit wont encourage anyone else to want to either, then I don't really know how to explain it.<br />
<br />
Maybe you don't like choppers, and that's fine. Maybe you like choppers, but not these ones in particular...also fine. All I'm saying is you didn't pay for anything here. This is offered to everyone for free. Maybe shitting all over the people who did it isn't such a good idea on the off chance that next time Blizzard reaches out to someone, it might be your thing. Would be pretty silly for the thing you appreciate in the world to be chased off by little shits who can't appreciate anything not directly beneficial, supportive, or just plain cool.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The fact they said they would only implement one does kind of skew people to vote for their factions regardless of what one looks better to them. WoW wide faction balance is pretty close as far as I know but apparently enough Alliance players see things how I do and the horde bike is better looking or the horde are just more active outside of the actual game.

No, see, again you're missing it. I fully realize that it disincentivizes them from doing shit like this. I want to dissuade them from doing shit like this, if this is the best they can manage.

I hate the sound of the existing chopper and i don't think that the sound of the new one will be much better. But i am sure that many alliance-player will get upset because of it. The thing i hated about Azeroth Choppers was that everyone could vote x times instead of simply making it so that 1 WoW-Account (with MoP) have 1 vote.<br />
<br />
But it was clear that the horde won. Blizzard only promote for the Horde; we saw it at a Blizzcon when it was so extreme that Mike Morhaine even needed to apologize to all alliance-players. And please let not forget how biased MoP was in terms of lore. Ok alliance won in 5.4 but we don't see it ingame. 5.1/5.2 was very balanced but 5.3 was a pure horde-patch with a small appendix of content for the alliance. So yes blizzard is biased for the horde.<br />

If this vote actually had really mattered it would have been handled much better then this. The entire series was a joke, both of these abominations are a joke, what Blizzard has done to the player base. UNFORGIVABLE!<br />

<br />
Chances are some alliance picked horde cause it looks like that faction would ride it. Take away the alliance shield and it looks like a shiny piece of metal.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Want some ointment to go with that butthurt?<br />
<br />
So liking your faction = being mindless...? Guess there are more mindless people on the Alliance since that faction is the bigger one. Also, tons of Alliance players voted for the Horde bike, they voted for LOOKS and not the faction they play. QQ More.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Would I watch a season 2? Sure, why not. It's entertainment on and off camera<br />
<br />
They're only up to episode 8, in episode 9 there's a massive surprise when Mike Morhaime defects to the Alliance and chops the head off of the horde bike.<br />
<br />
It turns out the alliance bike and Mike Morhaime were co-conspirators all along!</div></div><hr />

You almost made me believe you are serious. Still, nice try.<br />
<br />
OT: Horde one won because it can be be implemented into game without looking hilarious. Ally one wouldn't probably be used by anyone anyway.</div></div><hr />

What a blatant shit post. If you're really that arrogant, I feel sorry for you. You're like the people claiming for a fact that all Alliance players are below 15 years old and mostly Twilight fans...is that true? Must be if what you spouted here is. <br />
<br />
No it's not true, you're just spouting random shit because you are butthurt over the result. Be angry at your own faction, they didn't step up and vote for their own bike I'd say.<br />
<br />
I do hope you're being sarcastic, but considering the amount of QQ in this thread, it wouldn't surprise me if you weren't.</div></div><hr />

Sherlock,<br />
There is a lot more alliance characters than horde characters.<br />
Read it again<br />
Characters<br />
Not players<br />
This can include bots, Role players that log in a certain server to &quot;Role Play&quot;(not), and then theres the people actually playing the faction. <br />
Not counting the players that play both factions (because they increase both factions by the same amount and I for one, dont believe this nonsense)<br />
<br />
I wished that both choppers get put in the game with a feats of strength achievement included.<br />
instead, they put a stupid vote that I was able to abuse it and vote 6 times using 3 different browsers and 2 different domains (US and EU) that happens to not require the voter to log in his account that has world of warcraft purchased in it xDD.<br />
<br />
What a waste of time and a terrible one as well.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Blithe</div><div class="date">2014-06-05, 06:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">While I think the tractor wheels ruined both of them, myself and a lot of other players (even Alliance) could agree that the Horde bike was much better looking. And you can't shrug it off as &quot;Horde has more players&quot; because it doesn't, the facts are there that there are more Alliance players.</div></div><hr />

Alliance have more player, Horde have more Cheater. And yes, blizzard is biased towards Horde. I never saw one of these videos, but to make Metzen the Head of Alliance-Team: This alone made Horde win by default.<br />
<br />
And like i said: Happy that Horde got this noise-machines.</div></div><hr />

<br />
True that. I wonder what the guys of the bike shop actually think about these abominations, because both of them are disgusting to most bikers, but I guess the horde could at least be driven outside a parking lot.</div></div><hr />
