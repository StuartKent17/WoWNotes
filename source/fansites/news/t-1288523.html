<br />
Patch 5.3 - Battle of Razor Hill<br />
Today we are taking a look at the Battle of Razor Hill and quests leading up to it from the Horde perspective. You begin by traveling to Sen'jin village after completing two of the new scenarios, and speaking with Vol'jin (http://ptr.wowdb.com/quests/32867-voljin-of-the-darkspear). He sends you in to the Barrens (http://ptr.wowdb.com/quests/32819-battlefield-barrens) to collect 15 Lumber, Stone, Oil, and Meat, which requires killing one mob per item, looting crates with the items, or escorting the caravans that travel through the Barrens. While doing so, you will also earn some Lesser Charms from NPC drops. <br />
<br />
After gathering those supplies, you return to Vol'jin in time for the Battle of Sen'jin Village (http://ptr.wowdb.com/quests/32813-battle-of-senjin-village), in which you join Thrall and Chen Stormstout in defending the village (http://ptr.wowdb.com/quests/32813-battle-of-senjin-village) from the Kor'kron attackers. <br />
<br />
After a solid victory in Sen'jin Village, you march onward to Razor Hill with Vol'jin and Chen Stormstout. Upon arriving at Razor Hill, the battle is already underway in the air and on the ground. You defeat some guards, named NPCs, and release captive Razor Hill NPCs from cages before heading to see Vol'jin once again. Once at the small new Sanctuary area outside of Razor Hill, Baine Bloodhoof shows up to speak with Vol'jin about helping the revolution. <br />

Will we ever need our Prismatic Eye or Legendary Gem in 5.4?<br />
Our current thought is the meta gem continues to work in 5.4 helmets. The weapon gem unlikely. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/323143939223859200))<br />

Will there ever be a day where you drop the legendary no transmog thing? Such a dated concept. Let people show off.<br />
Potentially someday. Our goal all along was to start transmog off conservatively. It's very hard to do so later. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/318898244929335297))<br />

When is Blizz going to wake up that bloated loot tables make this worse! more smaller chances has high variance<br />
Keep in mind, our goal is not to gear up players as fast as possible. That may be the players' goal.... (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/321704031653343232))<br />
I think people tend to forget when people in their raid group get loot, but they always remember when *their* loot didn't drop<br />
Especially in Raid Finder, where you don't know or don't care if Stabby the rogue got his bracers. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/322439779323084800))<br />
<br />
How about a 5 or 10% xp buff for your account each time you reach max level per character? <br />
Above and beyond heirlooms and guild bonuses? At some point you're going to get a level every quest. Would that make sense? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/322391120124452866))<br />

You've said numerous times in the past you wished to get rid of racials. Are we ever going to see this happen?<br />
I doubt it. It's part of the fantasy of rolling a character. Not sure the non-twitter, non-forum players would understand. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/322080632933068801))<br />
<br />
so GC, tell me, how many dailies are planned for 5.3? Any plans in the next xpack to make reps account wide?<br />
I'm not a fan of account-wide rep. Seems one step removed from account-wide gear. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/321306743084834817))<br />
Except that it in no way is close to account wide gear. Still need to grind Valor, etc. Nice deflection though!<br />
Our philosophy has been to ask players to do almost everything on an alt that they do on a main, just faster. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/321435267103866880))<br />
It's all part of the same discussion though. What belongs to the character vs. the account? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/321435081388462083))<br />
<br />
If you don't want alts to catch up so easily, why is leveling so fast/easy/boring?<br />
It's a matter of degree. We don't want an alt to take as long as a main, but we do want actual gameplay there. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/321321079241052161))<br />

<br />
Already been mentioned they thought 6k was too much. For me that part of the quest dragged on. Reached Exalted with the Black Prince a couple of weeks before getting 6k valour points, making the quest line seem out of sync.<br />
<br />
I appreciate that time should be put in to do these things, but depending on the options available to specific players getting capped is either something you do without even noticing or something that seems incredibly tedious.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well it kind of makes sense when you look at it from a long-term perspective - if you just start in 5.3 for example, you have to do a LOT of work to catch up, and the 6k valor is the one you have the least influence on (6 weeks is 6 weeks).</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aesahaettr</div><div class="date">2013-04-16, 09:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">(6 weeks is 6 weeks)<br />
<br />
And that's only if you cap. Plenty of people I know (myself included) don't reach the cap on a regular basis. The time commitment per week to cap valor is greater than, for example, raiding LFR for token drops. <br />
<br />
There's a valid case to be argued that things should take time, of course. I personally did feel it was too high, but that's me and my slacker ways.</div></div><hr />

While that may be, there was never any real good reason why those reps were gated like that. This should have been done back in beta.<br />

<br />
Yes, it does, but it is really sad when the rules keep changing like that. Can't say exactly how I feel since I had to do it for the sake of keep going with the chain *almost* &quot;on time&quot; capping that valor while I could just sit back and relax somehow instead since I'm stuck with the low drop rate of the Secrets of the Empire anyways (yes, I know that having the valor thing done instead gives me the oportunity to drop some right now, but RNG is RNG and we're not talking about Raid Tiers and PvP Seasons catch up).<br />
<br />
I think that this step should be somehow be the 1st one or going together with the sigils part. Anyone starting right now (or an alt) will be earning most of their valor points right after dinging 90 because they're trying to get the ilvl to join ToT from heroics, the entire LFR system (msv/hof/tes wings) and Sunreaver dailies, but since they're stuck with the Sigil part... well... &quot;wasted&quot; valor points.<br />
<br />
I'm on that point. I have 2 &quot;mains&quot; (2 servers, 1 ally, 1 horde) and now I finally finished leveling 1 monk (horde). My horde &quot;main&quot; is on track collecting the Secrets, but my Ally &quot;main&quot; is stuck with the 6000 valor step (got tired eventualy and my old guild there disbanded, plus the server itself is kinda collapsing with lower and lower pop, so I basically gave up on it) and my monk still collecting sigils while not needing anymore that many valor points.<br />
<br />
Not to mention the fact that looks like we can't track the quest progression on alts, lol. The achievement used to track the 6000 points, but if I'm not mistaken, after you do it for the 1st time, you won't see it on your alts, or there is a way to do it?<br />
<br />
The golden lotus change is kinda like that, but not that much... it was something stupid to begin with. No reason to be need anything more than friendly, not to mention the excess of Golden Lotus dailies.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Overall elemental is doing much better this tier, enhancement is actually dead last on encounters like horridon and lei shen, even worse then non raid specs like arms or sublety rogues.<br />
<br />
I have no idea why blizzard has buffed enhance single target when its there aoe that is suffering, but perhaps they want elemental to be the aoe spec and enhance the burst spec.<br />
<br />
Burst has its advantages on fights that require it even though enhance dps overall is behind. Remember there isn't meant to be a hybrid penalty anymore with all the cross over buffs between classes yet shamans seem to be the only class still remaining under hyrbrid rules.</div></div><hr />
