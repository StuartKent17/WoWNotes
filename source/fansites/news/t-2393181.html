Class Development in Beta<br />
Being in beta now, how locked in are certain aspects of BfA class design? Are you still looking at class design as a whole or just addressing bugs or things that don’t function well? In the Legion beta many issues for class design were flagged by players but for the most part went unchanged for whatever reasons Blizzard had. This led to many severe class overhauls mid expansion. Can we expect that again?<br />
Hello!<br />
<br />
I wouldn't call anything &quot;locked&quot; during testing and active development. Our development processes are as iterative as they've ever been, and we're always looking for places where we need to make further changes to meet design goals.<br />
<br />
Having said that, we're close to finished with the changes to the rotations and the look and feel for most specs. We’ve still got a few changes coming soon in the Beta to Unholy Death Knights, Frost Death Knights, and Protection Warriors.<br />
<br />
We used the Alpha timeframe to make some surgical changes to several other specs, and we're somewhat finished with that stage of development for this expansion.<br />
<br />
In the days and weeks to come in the Beta, we're going to keep a focus on how every spec plays with regard to the new itemization systems in Battle for Azeroth. While it's certainly possible that feedback on how Azerite affects a certain spec could lead us to do further development on that spec's rotation, we don't expect to need any big changes to talents that would justify the words &quot;severe&quot; or &quot;overhaul&quot;.<br />
<br />
Beyond itemization concerns, there may be spots where we’ll do focused problem-solving around rotational issues (examples: “it turns out that simulations say never to use X, but X seems like it should be part of my core rotation” or “my spec is too feast-or-famine, and if I have bad luck with Y procs, I feel useless.”).<br />
<br />
As always, thank you very much for testing the Beta and making your experiences testing inform your feedback. Focused feedback is super-helpful.<br />
<br />
<br />
Patch 7.3.5 Hotfixes - April 24<br />

<br />
Antorus, The Broken Throne<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
User Interface<br />
<br />
The S.E.L.F.I.E. Camera should once again hide your UI when taking screenshots.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mafic</div><div class="date">2018-04-25, 12:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is very concerning, because this implies that a lot of issues that classes and specs had during Legion may not be addressed for a while. Basically if a spec or class didn't receive a check at this point then who knows when a pass will come around.<br />
<br />
Also, this shows that class design is going to be for the most part stuck in legion prepatch state before Azertie armor is factored in. That design paradigm pushes all the power on the backend where with the artifact you received some of the power right away as soon as you gained the weapon (eg artifact talent and a few traits).<br />
<br />
This is a massive gamble by Blizzard to put class design on the back burner and hope Azerite armor is enough of a pull for players to stick around for many months.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Especially because we've seen most of that armor now so unless the raid stuff is somehow transformative it's less impactful than tier sets (removed), legiondaries (removed), and artifacts (removed) so we are going to have completely hollow classes.<br />
<br />
Heck, let's face it, it's three traits tops. Even if they are all amazing, most classes have broken designs now. They dropped the ball with class design. World content is looking good. Raids seem like they will be good. Hopefully that makes the game worth playing. Otherwise we are looking at another WoD and can look forward to them fixing it in 9.0 or maybe a 8.1 or 8.2 if we're lucky.</div></div><hr />

<br />
From what I have discussed with someone else there will be powerful azerite pieces. But will players be willing to put in the time to finally have classes not feel so empty?<br />
<br />
Blizz since WoD has shifted their business strategy from building/maintaining subs to transactions through their store for services and merchandise along with focusing on box sales. This is why in Legion they had the artifact weapon as the pull feature for players to buy the box for Legion. Legendaries and set bonuses were just another layer for players to keep playing.<br />
<br />
But BFA doesn't have a feature to pull players in like artifact weapons. Coupled with very conservative class design which is really pruning 3.0 it seems to be assuming players are going to buy into the Azerite armor down the road. But most people don't buy an expansion to WoW for what reward they gain 4-6 months down the road IMVHO.</div></div><hr />

90% of tier sets are some passive bonuses that dont affect gameplay at all(just like weapon traits). &quot;Necessary&quot; legendaries that improve/change gameplay in a good way are to some degree talents now. I don't really feel like gameplay will be worse than it is right now. I'll the miss the legendaries that brought changes but on the other hand i'm welcoming the new talents to most classes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is no new talents. The new talents are displacing existing talents which implies the number of talents available will stay the same since WoD heading into BFA. They justified this in Legion because the Artifact weapon was basically the old talent system with gold traits being like additional talents to a specific spec. However, BFA does not have anything like this and having classes stuck in a Legion prepatch state heading into an expansion is counter to what a MMORPG should be about.<br />
<br />
Most games that stop giving talents and abilities out don't increase the level cap. Most of the abilities WoW characters gain stop by 90 and by 100 you are not gaining any new talents. There literally is no reason for leveling ten levels anymore due to level scaling.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When they even stop doing false promises this time (like they normally do), and this so soon, at the start of the beta, then you can be sure, for them things are 99% finalized and even less stuff will change than in Legion alpha. Or in short: What you see now class wise, will go life nearly unchanged.<br />
<br />
This is really fucked up stuff.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They gave you new moon back... they just put it in the tier with talents that you already wanted to take anyway, resulting in a +/- 0. They did that for many/most classes that were lucky enough to actually get their stuff back, like fire mages for example who have the phoenix in the tier where they already had hot-streak generators, now they just have to decide between proper single target rotation or AoE..<br />
<br />
On one hand I'm glad that DK isn't done yet, but I have very little faith that what they will do to the DK dps specs is something that I woudl agree with. I actually just see them taking out some of the useless shit talents for frost and unholy and add the artifact abilities in somewhere where they won't be picked anyway.<br />
<br />
Overall the whole theme of the classes is less of everything. The only way to fix most of that would be if every other azerite piece came with &quot;soul of the x&quot; type traits for the rest of the expansion. And frankly relying on a crutch like that, especially if potentially raid only, to fix class design.. I don't know, sounds fun, right? Right?!</div></div><hr />

<br />
All three of these things made it well into Legion before one of them was removed and openly apologized for as a stupid idea, another rightfully nerfed, and the other replaced in Battle for Azeroth because the guy that invented it no longer worked on World of Warcraft.<br />

<br />
lo and behold.<br />
<br />
This might just result in a disaster. So many classes got watered down even further, losing a ton of stuff without getting anything back. I'd love to see this all work and be fun but seeing the classes as they are...Well all I want right now is Cata or MoP Class design back to be honest.<br />
<br />
Oh well, we'll see, maybe we're all wrong and BFA will be awesome. Or it'll just be kind of bleh because, as usual, &quot;We listen to your feedback!&quot; means we won't do shit until a major patch in, Alpha is just there to fix a few obvious gamebreaking bugs, kthxbye.<br />
<br />
Remember when MoP launched with a quest that wasn't completable by multiple people at the same time even though this bug was reported in the beta tons of times and thus people had to make a physical queue? While funny and memorable this was not intentional and is just one of many examples of what Blizz thinks a Beta is.</div></div><hr />

Sorry, this happened for Legion Alpha/Beta and they didn't fix/change the classes that had problems (like DKs). They just focused in launching Legion as fast as possible (just like they're doing it now with this rushed BfA launch date) and then started the band-aid fixes through Legion.<br />

Except that the expansion came out in a really crap state and had tons of band-aid fixes everywhere to address all the problems reported during Legion's alpha and beta.<br />
<br />
And that took most of the expansion, with some classes basically unplayable for group content like heroic/mythic raid. Like dps DKs with the bare minimum dps needed (in fact lower than that for frost) or tank DKs without necessary CDs to survive.</div></div><hr />

Arms is fine besides rage regen. Fury is just fucked and they seem to have no intentions of fixing it. SV doesn't seem too bad from what I tested, not a big fan of the playstyle but i'd still play it.<br />

Yup, that will most certainly happen again. Any spec which lost a lot from the artifacts will be unplayable. Aff, Fury, Fire, Sub, Shadow(maybe) are the ones that come to mind.</div></div><hr />

It was never going to be a pretty thing at the end of Legion, when it was inevitable to feel like most classes lost mechanics one would come to expect or enjoy. So I hope Blizz can navigate clear from that with the azurite system and such, because right now it does look a bit messy, and somehow the revamped specs look most complete just because they saw a ground up re-evaluation after Legion.<br />
<br />
I think Blizz has very talented class designers but i think they just give them too little time before the balancing period sets in, where things has to be locked in. To use Balance as an example, it's got a wonderful kit, it's truly great to play the spec... until you go into combat and fall asleep, just from the arti removal. It's so close, but it needs something more to be truly wonderful, in that combat rotation.<br />
<br />
Also, don't get me wrong, it sounds like I hate the Artifacts. I don't, really, but I think it seems like there was too little plan when time would come to retire it; nobody likes to feel like their class got less dynamic and that has to happen if you surgically cut a system that integral to how the class plays. It has a chance to continue in the Azurite system, but it's been a giant question mark for so long that it just won't calm people. So I hope we get an in depth design blog on how that's going to work. If it's mostly boring passives, more like traits, etc. To what extent it will replace arti traits, essentially.</div></div><hr />

The thing is...<br />
<br />
It is more difficult, it actually takes more effort to them, to make this (forgive me) shit of a mess, than to actually just bake the artifacts in the classes as a set of passives and actives.<br />
<br />
And it would be more &quot;logical&quot; for leveling. Post Legion 100-110 leveling should be empowerment, not a temporary power burst.<br />

Its like in the spell book were &quot;lvl 5 -&gt; learn fireball&quot; &quot;lvl 20 -&gt; unlearn fireball&quot;</div></div><hr />

Pretty much this. I'm debating sitting out the expansion at this point. Alpha was bad and there was so much feedback given on classes and they literally changed nothing. I haven't logged into beta yet but apparently there are little to no changes from alpha according to feedback posts.</div></div><hr />

As for Shadow priests, I think on live (I have awful leggos and no set bonus) that you at times spend too little time in void form. In the alpha, it was excruciatingly little time. I haven't tried shadow priest in beta, yet.<br />
Frost DK still exists. I dislike this. <br />
The sustainability of Windwalker is not good enough in my opinion. The healing we had removed with the Artifact weapon and the cooldown increase on Transcendence makes me a bit unhappy with my favourite melee spec.<br />
The prune with legion removed depth in classes because we got back some in the artifact weapon. Which is now removed and not replaced.<br />
<br />
Classes seem very similar and without identity, with some (excellent!) exceptions.</div></div><hr />

I must admit, I don't get the Legion hate. It was an extremely good expansion. Okay, some aspects weren't perfect, but no expansion was perfect.<br />

Most people who list the problems with it list the things that they, personally at that time in their life, found mildly inconvenient.<br />

The expansion started with so many upset, it was only when a class got deep into an artifact, one or two months in, before the chatter died down. Oh and don't even get me on how people felt about alts in the early part of the expansion. But people seem to forget early legion and the crying that accord.</div></div><hr />

Well, the alt thing was in part a previous Blizz screw up in a terrible expansion. WoD had absolutely nothing to do so people leveled alts. Then Legion hit with far too many things to do even for one character and people got pissed because they had a million alts and no time to play them. <br />
<br />
Artifact progression was perfectly fine for picking a character and just playing it IMO, but it was frustrating to have several characters that I wanted to play and absolutely no time to devote to them. I never saw that as a Legion issue though, I saw it as a WoD issue because I had spent the past two years playing 12 classes because there was so little to do that I could.</div></div><hr />

If you force people to stick to 1 class 1 spec don't make it a rollercoaster of balance. Even the most informed beta testers couldn't have known what's gonna be worth playing half a year into Legion because so much was thrown upside down. 7.2 was even bigger reshuffle of power, but at least by then some catch ups were implemented.</div></div><hr />

They should just have made the one artifact ability a baseline spell for each spec. This is not rocket science, really. We have learned the respective spell / ability from wielding the artifact, and got to keep the knowledge despite their destruction. Easy as pie. Though maybe some artifact abilities are not as spectacular as others (Sindragosa, Fire Phoenixes etc), I would love to keep them all as a baseline spell, not some kind of &quot;chose talent or lose it completely&quot; bullshit. Since they have started pruning characters I feel that we regress instead of progressing our characters.</div></div><hr />

That's not what he means. He's saying that all of the things you just listed could arguably be made available at 110, since there's no real progression from 110-120 besides baseline stat increases and item level. You could keep players at 110 and lock everything behind gear and questing, and there would be no difference.<br />
