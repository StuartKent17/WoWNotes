Legion PvP Season 1 Rewards<br />
Some players did not receive their titles as expected - we are aware of this. We have a fix that will be deployed during realm restarts which should be happening within the next 24 hours. We’ve made sure that all eligible players are flagged correctly, and we expect this distribution to go smoothly.<br />
<br />
We appreciate your patience with this, and thank you for your understanding. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/791266-legion-pvp-season-1-rewards/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20752439581?page=6#101))<br />

Holy shit can I please stop being dumped into silvershard mines with 3 BM hunters. 3 BM hunters on any team is an instant loss.<br />
what's your top BM Hunters In PvP complaint? (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/817182997933760512))<br />
<br />
Thanks for being the BM Hunter hero we needed with regards to the tier set and Hati. If I could give you a bonus I would.<br />
Can't take credit, all of these things were done by the class team before I said anything, they are pretty on top of stuff (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/817476614107774977))<br />
<br />
Karazhan<br />
i thought lfg for Karazhan was coming in 7.1.5? or is that later?<br />
That's for Patch 7.2 (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/818565638687846405))<br />

Spontaneous Appendages were stealth nerfed in patch 7.1.5. <br />
Lots of people reported the damage output was cut in half</div></div><hr />

It's just bad design if an ilvl840 trinket beats out most 870+ ones. No excuses here.<br />
<br />
This just screams &quot;clueless monkeys&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
890 CoF is still simmed better than 875 FCM so don't worry about farming VotW again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yea, we understand what Crusade is. The trinket was not &quot;insanely powerful&quot;, it only sim'ed at +20kdps for me replacing my FCM. Given that agi classes can equip things like bloodthirsty and spontaneous, it didn't seem unreasonable that Ret have one really good trinket that they could equip.<br />
<br />
Note: You wouldn't equip both CoF and FCM. CoF Breaks FCM and makes it worst than a stat-stick.</div></div><hr />
