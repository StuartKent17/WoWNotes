Upcoming Camera Changes<br />
Thanks for everyone’s reports so far. We’ve been able to use them to isolate a few more potential sources of motion sickness, and are currently working on sending out a small hotfix patch that will hopefully address at least some of them. We wanted to give a quick heads up on what we’re changing.<br />
<br />
For starters, we were able to identify some potential issues with how flying mounts are behaving differently (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcJKjB0VZo0) in patch 7.0.3 compared to 6.2.4 that we believe will help some players. Once this hotfix is live, flying mounts will no longer bank/lean to the sides when rotating in place, and the extent to which they lean when turning while in motion will be lowered back to how it was in patch 6.2.4. Additionally, we’re fixing an issue that was causing the camera to “pop” when landing or taking off on a flying mount.<br />
<br />
We also identified and fixed some bugs that were causing some fairly extreme issues with the camera while the player is considered by the game to be in a “vehicle.” Because of how that tech is used, this includes several situations that might not obviously seem like you’re in a vehicle, such as the later parts of the Al’Akir encounter.<br />
<br />
Finally, we received a surprising number of reports from players that indicated they had somehow unknowingly activated “Action Cam (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QXA3revYpk).” For those who are unfamiliar, Action Cam is an experimental alternate form of camera control that is currently unfinished and not quite ready for the general public. It had become available through a console command in the Legion beta, but since it doesn’t give any unfair gameplay advantages and (so we thought) had to be expressly activated by the player, we’d left it accessible through that command.<br />
<br />
However, it has become clear that more than a few players have somehow turned it on without knowing, and it’s a major cause of motion sickness for those players. So, we’re going to disable it entirely for now, and plan to bring it back in a future patch once we’ve sorted out all the motion sickness issues and given it a little bit more polish.<br />
<br />
These fixes will be active on the PTR and Beta realms for testing as soon as possible, and if all goes well, we plan to apply them to live realms on Monday, August 1. Once they’re live, please do continue to report areas of the game or activities in which you’re finding yourself feeling unwell. Videos in particular are extremely helpful, as they allow us to see exactly what the camera is doing at the time. We’re continuing to put our highest priority on resolving these issues and getting you back in the game without having to worry about motion sickness.</div></div><hr />

/edit: For the Harbringer video... mediocre at best. I'd rather have Khadgar become the guardian so he can keep the legion at bay by the tomb of Sageras while we gather allys on the continent. Which would be a great explanation to why we see so little legion presence in the zones. <br />

It was a clearly unfinished idea, that causes problems for some players. Since it wasn't supposed to be available for most people they just took it out.<br />
If it's broke and you cannot fix it right now, it's best to remove it.</div></div><hr />

It didn't cause any issues, people who shouldn't use it turned it on for some reason and then ruined it for the rest of us.<br />
<br />
<br />
While the deafening cry for max zoom is ignored once again. Typical Blizzard.<br />
<br />
Max zoom was purposefully changed with detailed reasoning. This &quot;deafening cry&quot; is purposefully being ignored because max zoom was not accidentally changed or broken and it's not an experimental change. Deal with it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Something that could easily be solved by adding this optional, unfinished functionality into the options menu. It is far from the first time incomplete or not fully implemented tech has been made an option in the menus. IPv6, initial DirectX11 support, the 64 bit client, the list goes on...<br />
<br />
But instead of at least giving us the option they just removed it. Unfinished? Maybe. But with the DynamicCam addon, I was having much more than an &quot;unfinished&quot; experience.</div></div><hr />

1) where is the Guardian's staff? this one do not resemble it.<br />
2) how can he turn into a Raven?<br />
<br />
The Raven form is part of Atiesh, he mentions it in a quest in Legion. When you're flying to Azsuna or Suramar Khadgar says something about preferring the Raven form from Atiesh over flying mounts. And which Guardian's staff? I'm pretty sure all of the previous Guardian's had their own Staffs. Arcane Mages get Aegwynn's for example.</div></div><hr />

You're right, it was never an issue before. Shameless blizz apologist, you literally want them to keep the change just because they said they liked the change ... not only that but you freely admit it. <br />

<br />
entitled little child, let me explain... <br />
<br />
1) They were playing WoW and it was fine until 7.0<br />
<br />
2) You never had action cam before this<br />
<br />
3) making changes that make your customers sick isn't good business. Fixing that is good service, not PC you brat<br />
<br />
4) So we're basically going to have the camera as it has been the entire fucking time you've been playing minus the last couple of weeks.</div></div><hr />

The roots will heal in time... as will the entire world. The sacrifices have been made. Just as the orcs, humans, and night elves discarded their old hatreds and stood united against a common foe, so did Nature herself rise up to banish the Shadow...forever. As for me, I came back to ensure that there would be a future, to teach the world that it no longer needed Guardians. The hope for future generations has always resided in mortal hands. And now that my task is done, I will take my place...amongst the legends of the past.<br />

How's that so hard to not being a possibility?<br />
<br />
We know that Aegwynn, Medivh's mother defeated the Avatar of Sargeras and locked it in to the Tomb of Sargeras.<br />
We also know that before the avatar was sealed in to the tomb, Sargeras' spirit essence went in to Aegwynn's body and stayed there waiting. As Sargeras knew Aegwynn would have a son, who would likely become the next guardian. What's a better way to defeat something than to infiltrate and corrupt the very thing that is meant to destroy you, before they are even born.<br />
Waiting for Aegwynn to give birth to Medivh, to whom the spirit then transferred. This is how Medivh was originally corrupted and helped open the Dark Portal.<br />
Even Khadgar eventually found out and he was the one to kill Medivh with 2 others. But Medivh has been resurrected since, he's actually been resurrected a couple times, one time before he worked on the Dark portal even, so that shows that Sargeras spirit can stay in his body even if the body dies.<br />
To me that sounds a lot like having Medivh's body as his current avatar until it's possible to for him to return to his original avatar, if that even is possible, depends what remains of it when it was destroyed. Aegwynn believed that sealing the avatar in to the tomb would actually stop the spirit of Sargeras being resurrected in the nether as the demons usually do.<br />
Currently Medivh is assumed very much to be alive and his whereabouts are totally unknown.<br />
The Harbringers clip shows that Medivh's spirit is tied to Karazhan, well that might actually be the demon inside him.<br />
I think that what's left of actual Medivh is long gone and Sargeras is the dominant person, much like there was some bits left of Arthas within the Lich King.<br />
The bits that kept LK just destroying everything, and Arthas was loosing the control little by little. Same thing that could happen here.<br />
Medivh's final control is fading and Sargeras is taking control and Legion is coming.<br />
<br />
For story I'd think that be a hell of a plot twist if everyone is expecting Kil'jaeden to be the final boss or actual Sargeras, the titan that can slice entire planets in half with a single swing of his sword, unlikely some mere mortals no matter what artifacts they wield could defeat such power.<br />
But a possessed human as his avatar is another story. Since that has been done by a guardian before once already.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A better solution would have been players not rushing so much into a feature they did not understand.<br />
It was lacking in-game UI and controls for the reason of being unsupported, and so should have only been used by players with the knowledge of how to turn it off manually.<br />
But of course that did not happen.<br />
<br />
Aside from turning it on, the most frequent question was how to turn it off.<br />
Until the feature is in a better state, I would rather they kept it off.<br />

Not that I care about the action camera, but literally everyone who complains about motion sickness are just lying in an attempt to make blizzard increase the max camera distance. I'm surprised anyone actually believes that bullshit.<br />
<br />
I don't think all are lying, but it was certainly a popular gripe to complain about for the sake of complaining.<br />
Those who claimed that the game was unplayable as melee for example were hugely exaggerating.<br />
In some cases I think players mistakenly attributed that factor alone to issues they were experiencing, when the post from blizzard there makes it clear that camera change was not in isolation.</div></div><hr />

Pretty sure all of his appearances after his first death were just supposed to be his &quot;echo.&quot; Hence &quot;Echo of Medivh.&quot; Certainly that was the case when he appeared in Karazhan, and again later in the comics to offer guidance to Med'an.<br />
<br />
In this short the entity wasn't even Medivh, but rather a disguised dreadlord trying to tempt Khadgar into serving the Burning Legion.<br />
<br />
I don't see how any of this hints at him returning.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Medivh was never actually corrupted in the sense that he was turned to the Legions side he had been possessed since before he was even born by Sargeras's spirit. After he was defeated it seems like he either was purged of the possession or because he learned of the possession was able to suppress it. I'm not sure if it's still canon but in the book Shadow's and Light he is said to be one of Azeroths Eternals and he makes this comment in Warcraft 3 &quot;I left my humanity behind long ago. I am something...different now.&quot;</div></div><hr />

//Blizzard Logo<br />
Khadgar: Once again, the Burning Legion has returned... Stronger, more determined than ever before. I venture to Karazhan on a mission of desperation.<br />
Harbingers: Khadgar<br />
Khadgar: Show yourself.<br />
//Medivh appears from the shadows<br />
Medvih: My apprentice returns, it is good to see you again Khadgar.<br />
Khadgar: Medivh? How?<br />
Medivh: My spirit is bound to this tower.<br />
Khadgar: Yes, of course, Medivh.. there is so much I need..<br />
Medivh: You look terrible old friend, why have you come here?<br />
Khadgar: The Burning Legion invades again. I come seeking the knowledge you kept here, anything that can help me stand against them.<br />
Medivh: Defeating the Legion this time will take more than some spell I'm afraid. You came seeking knowledge, what you need is a weapon.<br />
Khadgar: I don't understand.<br />
Medivh: You defeated me when I was consumed by Fel madness. But you never took the next step towards your destiny. It is time Azeroth had a guardian once again.<br />
Khadgar: A guardian? After your failings, it was decided that none could resist the temptation of such power. We don't need a guardian Medivh.<br />
Medivh: Then, I ask again, why are you here? If not a guardian, if not you, then who can stop the approaching storm? if you cannot embrace your fate, then all you have accomplished, all you have sacrificed, will have been for nothing.<br />
//Vision of Dalaran burning<br />
//Khadgar looking into mirror<br />
Khadgar: Even if I said yes, none now remain to bestow the powers of a guardian upon me.<br />
Medivh: I remain.. I knew this day would come, before my death, I imbued this tome with an echo of my essence. Open it, absorb it's energies as your own.<br />
Khadgar: No, I cannot..I should not<br />
//Medivh looking over Khadgar's shoulder<br />
Medivh: The fate of Azeroth rests in your hands Khadgar. Accept your desires.. Show the Legion the true might of a guardian.<br />
//Khadgar overlooking Legion forces<br />
Medivh: Be honest with yourself, if not with me. You know you are destined for this.<br />
Khadgar: Oh it is true, I have thought about becoming a guardian every day. Even now.. I desire it. I've yearned for the Legion to cringe before the fury I would unleash. And that is why I can never accept your offer.<br />
//Khadgar destroys tome.<br />
//Medivh turns into a demon.<br />
Medivh: Hahaha, your will is strong. My brethren were right, you would have served the Legion well.<br />
Khadgar: I will never be the legions pawn.. AND THIS TOWER WILL NOT BE IT'S DEN!<br />
//Khadgar blows demon out of the window<br />
Khadgar: I came to karazhan seeking knowledge, what I found was a reminder... that no single person, not even a guardian, can stand against the Legion alone. As before, we must band together, united for Azeroth!<br />
//Khadgar flies into the sun.</div></div><hr />

The reason is only one: the camera zoom out huge restriction(imposition)! I get less information on the screen so I'm forced to move the camera frequently and quicker. That's it!<br />
<br />
And do you really believe that so many players manage to activate the action cam but they were unable to disable it. You need only 10 seconds to google &quot;disable action cam&quot;.. 10 seconds to find the answer.<br />

<br />
Too bad that serious problem for some people (motion sickness) became a tool for others to try to get old max cam distance back by false reporting the issue.<br />
<br />
Recently I started thinking that removing so much stuff from in-game options was a right move. Even with fewer option people do not understand what they are doing, addon developers are bombarded by questions on how to disable\enable this and that, for example, personal health\power\resource bars under the character, yet those are default UI features and can be easily toggled.</div></div><hr />

Seriously. They need to increase max viewing distance. I didn't think it would impact my gameplay as much as it has done. <br />
I can't say how its gonna be in legion in raids and dungeons but atm its a gamebreaker for me. <br />
I want to see the entire room if possible. I want to have full controll and see everything. Eventho I'm not the raidleader I'm calling out alot of stuff and well, thats not the case anymore.<br />
Mannoroth for example is dogshit for me (and rest of the guild) atm. I hate it. And seeing how much we're wiping to weird mechanics I think my guildies are struggling with this aswell.<br />
Why force us to use a lower value instead of giving everyone the option to increase it? <br />
I don't get it, I absolutely do not get it. <br />
Their stupid explantion is so bad aswell. <br />
If they want us to see more stuff more close up, atleast make it so that you can increase it under the &quot;raid and battleground settings&quot;.<br />
<br />
I'm really sad about this. :(<br />
Playing a game for so many years and then quit due to a camera change would be really akward.<br />

<br />
You mean the epic finale, that already is BS because Archimonde survived and the mortal races of Azeroth did jack shit?<br />
Same with the dragons at the end of Cata. &quot;We stoped the hour of twilight, now we are no longer needed as guardians of azeroth&quot;. Few years later: THE LEGION IS BACK.<br />
<br />
Azeroth not needing a guardian anymore would work, if the Legion was defeated to the point where they never again would attack Azeroth AND the Old Gods were dealt with. Neither of those is true, but now 12 heros are enough to deal with every problem azeroth will ever face.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Summer</div><div class="date">2016-07-29, 05:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">entitled little child, let me explain... <br />
<br />
1) They were playing WoW and it was fine until 7.0<br />
<br />
2) You never had action cam before this<br />
<br />
3) making changes that make your customers sick isn't good business. Fixing that is good service, not PC you brat<br />
<br />
4) So we're basically going to have the camera as it has been the entire fucking time you've been playing minus the last couple of weeks.<br />
<br />
Your point 4) is in fact not correct as well still won't have max zoom.<br />
<br />
I've been following the whole camera and motion sickness debacle pretty closely and I don't think the &quot;people lying to get max zoom back&quot; is actually the main thing here at all. There is even a big thread of people saying their motion sickness is caused by something else than the zoom level, and there are also plenty of people (such as myself) saying they don't have motion sickness but can't stand the new zoom level because they're used to the old levels or can't see stuff in raids anymore. <br />
<br />
Motion sickness is just the only argument getting any attention from Blizzard and I find it hilarious that they will do a long list of possible causes yet not even mention the most obvious one, the camera zoom. This stubborness is making me believe that there is some technical reason why they *need to* reduce zoom levels that they just don't want to admit to for whatever reason. Because the &quot;it's cheating!&quot; and &quot;immersion&quot; arguments were some of the purest BS seen in a while and after that we've seen nothing but silence despite several capped threads on forums :P</div></div><hr />

Medvih: My apprentice returns, it is good to see you again Khadgar.<br />
Khadgar: Medivh? How?<br />
Medivh: My spirit is bound to this tower.<br />
Khadgar: Yes, of course, Medivh.. there is so much I need..<br />
Medivh: You look terrible old friend, why have you come here?<br />
Khadgar: The Burning Legion invades again. I come seeking the knowledge you kept here, anything that can help me stand against them.<br />
Medivh: Defeating the Legion this time will take more than some spell I'm afraid. You came seeking knowledge, what you need is a weapon.<br />
Khadgar: I don't understand.<br />
Medivh: You defeated me when I was consumed by Fel madness. But you never took the next step towards your destiny. It is time Azeroth had a guardian once again.<br />
Khadgar: A guardian? After your failings, it was decided that none could resist the temptation of such power. We don't need a guardian Medivh.<br />
Medivh: Then, I ask again, why are you here? If not a guardian, if not you, then who can stop the approaching storm? if you cannot embrace your fate, then all you have accomplished, all you have sacrificed, will have been for nothing.<br />
//Vision of Dalaran burning<br />
//Khadgar looking into mirror<br />
Khadgar: Even if I said yes, none now remain to bestow the powers of a guardian upon me.<br />
Medivh: I remain.. I knew this day would come, before my death, I imbued this tome with an echo of my essence. Open it, absorb it's energies as your own.<br />
Khadgar: No, I cannot..I should not<br />
//Medivh looking over Khadgar's shoulder<br />
Medivh: The fate of Azeroth rests in your hands Khadgar. Accept your desires.. Show the Legion the true might of a guardian.<br />
//Khadgar overlooking Legion forces<br />
Medivh: Be honest with yourself, if not with me. You know you are destined for this.<br />
Khadgar: Oh it is true, I have thought about becoming a guardian every day. Even now.. I desire it. I've yearned for the Legion to cringe before the fury I would unleash. And that is why I can never accept your offer.<br />
//Khadgar destroys tome.<br />
//Medivh turns into a demon.<br />
Medivh: Hahaha, your will is strong. My brethren were right, you would have served the Legion well.<br />
Khadgar: I will never be the legions pawn.. AND THIS TOWER WILL NOT BE IT'S DEN!<br />
//Khadgar blows demon out of the window<br />
Khadgar: I came to karazhan seeking knowledge, what I found was a reminder... that no single person, not even a guardian, can stand against the Legion alone. As before, we must band together, united for Azeroth!<br />
//Khadgar flies into the sun.<br />

<br />
and you are intended to for years you didnt have to and this gave you unfair advantage over 99 % of wow population - guess what now you are down to earth with everybody else and playign game how devs intended to with all the limitations of field of vision they intended.<br />
<br />
I'll humor you.. unfair advantage over whom? ..over the LFR/Normal average player? They didn't care before and they don't care now. Do you really think, in the history of the game, even one, serious, competitive mythic raider didn't know about the camera zoom command? <br />
Every olympic athlete has an &quot;unfair advantage&quot; over a 5 years old kid.. so? Do you nerf all the olympic games to please him? Even so, the camera restrictions are limiting the information and that will be compensate with addons; the average players won't know them and that's again your unfair advantage just shifted with many enraged players as bonus.<br />
And the monitor? A 21:9 ratio monitor gives really a lot of information more than a 16:9 or even worst, a 16:10 (assuming all the 4:3 now in hell). That's a new, even more serious, unfair advantage.<br />
<br />
In conclusion, drop the unfair advantage argument and stop believing &quot;that's how the devs intended the game&quot;, a little bug discovered after 11 years.. please.. I can only guess about the real motivations.. money, lack of informations or a game designer too proud to admit the huge mistake.<br />
<br />
I'm sure of one thing: I won't stop complaining because every time I move the camera I'm reminded of this gamebreaking problem. Every present and future content or improvements will be tainted by the camera too close as will be every comment or conversation about WoW.</div></div><hr />

It made them feel more alive; they shouldn't turn like they are stuck on a stationary axis for example, that looks silly. Why not just add a toggle for new and old animations, and anyone who wants to turn them off can. As for the camera zoom, I really hate not being able to zoom out from my character. Especially on large mounts that take up the whole screen and I'm now stuck staring at a mammoth's butt.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, I like the new flying mount changes too. I hope they enable them on a toggle in the future for people who aren't bothered by it.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nyssie</div><div class="date">2016-07-31, 04:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Finally, we received a surprising number of reports from players that indicated they had somehow unknowingly activated “Action Cam.” For those who are unfamiliar, Action Cam is an experimental alternate form of camera control that is currently unfinished and not quite ready for the general public. It had become available through a console command in the Legion beta, but since it doesn’t give any unfair gameplay advantages and (so we thought) had to be expressly activated by the player, we’d left it accessible through that command.<br />
<br />
However, it has become clear that more than a few players have somehow turned it on without knowing, and it’s a major cause of motion sickness for those players. So, we’re going to disable it entirely for now, and plan to bring it back in a future patch once we’ve sorted out all the motion sickness issues and given it a little bit more polish.<br />
<br />
Glad they are disabling this, but &quot;unknowingly activated&quot; my ass. I &quot;expressly activated&quot; no such console command when the patch went live, as is the case with many, many others I'm sure.</div></div><hr />

They have said they are passionate about the change and trying to fix the issues affecting people. They are standing firm on the zoom, which is good. I am tired of them giving in to every single whine post.<br />
