Auction House Guide - Introduction and Enchanting<br />
The last time I posted something that looked like a guide on this site was ... a long time ago. People who know me are aware that a huge part of my activity when I started playing World of Warcraft (or any other MMO actually) was trading and it definitely was something really enjoyable during the early days (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/september/ah1_07_29_2005.jpg) of the game (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/september/ah2_07_29_2005.jpg). <br />
<br />
I eventually stopped trading after reaching something like 15 000 gold (and that was a lot of money back in the days) because I realized that gold wasn't really useful ... I never really had to farm again because I'm not a big spender. A few months ago I started playing again and decided to level all classes to 80 (mostly to make my life easier on the site) and eventually realized that I would have to find 40 000 gold to buy an epic flying mount on all these new chars. This is where I stopped leveling and started to go back to the Auction House ... 4 years after my last sale. <br />
<br />
I apologize for the wall of text, if you want a good reason to keep reading I will just say that I made 125 000 gold in 7 weeks just by doing that. (and probably have an extra 25 or 50 000 gold in reagents sitting in my bank) <br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/september/allplayed_small.jpg (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/september/allplayed.jpg)<br />
<br />
Addons<br />
You will need addons and there is NO WAY you can survive without them. People who know how to use them will make tons of money, all the others will just wonder why people undercut them so fast. (This is probably the most unfair use of addons in this game in my opinion, but that's just my opinion) <br />
<br />
The first one you will have to download is obviously Auctioneer (http://auctioneeraddon.com/?p=home), just download the latest release version and install it. <br />
The second one isn't very popular yet but is VERY powerful if you know how to use it : Quick Auctions 2 (http://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info12196-QuickAuctions2.html). <br />
<br />
Just make sure both addons are installed if you want to follow this guide. <br />
<br />
<br />
Risk-free investments<br />
If you're not comfortable with massive AH trading, there are a few ways to make gold out of the AH without any risk. The best examples are Borean Leather (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/33568/borean-leather/) and Cobalt Ore (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/36909/cobalt-ore/).<br />
<br />
Borean Leather (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/33568/borean-leather/) is kinda hard to sell on most servers and can go as low as 30S or 25S on some of them .... That's pretty awesome when you realize that a Nerubian Chestguard (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/50956/nerubian-chestguard/) takes 12 Borean Leather and sells for 5G 29S to the NPCs .... Yes, that's 44S for each unit of leather. If you buy 25 stacks of Borean Leather for 5G each, you will get 95G just to buy them, go AFK while you craft 41 Nerubian Chestguard (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/50956/nerubian-chestguard/), come back to sell them at the closest NPC. <br />
<br />
You can do the exact same thing with Cobalt Ore (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/36909/cobalt-ore/) and Cobalt Bar (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/36916/cobalt-bar/), a Cobalt Triangle Shield (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/54550/cobalt-triangle-shield/) takes 4 bars and sells for 5G54S, that's 1G38S for each bar. In some occasions Cobalt will sell for 1G/unit at the AH and buying 15 stacks at this price will get you 114G just to craft a few shields. <br />
<br />
If you are really lazy, you can just use Auctioneer to automatically scan for items listed below their NPC price to buy them from the AH just to sell them to the closest NPC.<br />
<br />
Push the arrow at the top of the AH Panel (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/september/auctioneer_getall.jpg) to scan the whole Auction House, it shouldn't take more than a few seconds and it will let you download the data of ALL the items at the Auction House.<br />
When the scan is complete go to the Search tab at the bottom of the Panel and go to Searchers &gt; Vendor.<br />
Set a value in Minimum Profit (like 10s), checking &quot;Allow Bids&quot; will let you bid on any auction that could yield a profit when it ends and &quot;Allow Buyout&quot; will only scan for profit based on the buyout (if you really want instant cash)<br />
Just click Purchase at the bottom of the screen (Holding CTRL + Alt + Shift when you click it will let you purchase all the items at once) and wait for the end of the auctions to grab your items and sell them at the closest NPC<br />
<br />
Just keep in mind that it definitely isn't as profitable as Cobalt or Borean Leather. You will probably do it for a few days because it's fun and eventually realize that the profits are really low because everyone with Auctioneer does it. <br />
<br />
<br />
Buying items<br />
Now that you know what to buy and how much you want to spend, you need a way to do that automatically .... and this is where Auctioneer becomes really useful. <br />
<br />
Run another full scan by clicking the double arrow at the top of the AH panel<br />
Go to the Search tab and Searchers &gt; Snatch<br />
<br />
The Snatch function of auctioneer lets you build a shopping list of all the items you want to buy and the maximum price you want to spend on them. To add an item just :<br />
<br />
Drag and drop it in the frame<br />
Set a price for this item, check &quot;Allow bids&quot; if you want to buy stuff without buyout (Note: I don't do that) and &quot;Allow buyouts&quot; if you just want instant items. (That's the option I use) <br />
Push &quot;Search&quot; at the bottom left of the panel<br />
<br />
Auctioneer will automatically list all the items available at this price at the AH, you can just select one and click purchase or just Ctrl + Alt + Shift click Purchase to buy all the results (and this is what you will do most of the time if you have a decent Snatch list)<br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/september/snatch1_small.jpg (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/september/snatch1.jpg) http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/september/snatch2_small.jpg (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/september/snatch2.jpg) http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/september/snatch3_small.jpg (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/september/snatch3.jpg)<br />
<br />
It shouldn't take more than a minute or two (scan included) to empty the AH of all the cheap Cobalt / Leather / Eternal Earths etc ... <br />
<br />
Enchanting (and disenchanting)<br />
Enchanting is a good way to make money, most players do that by sitting in the Trade channel to find people who needs enchants and try to get a few golds for clicking a button but your best bet to make money is ... disenchanting. <br />
<br />
People do not really need gold in WotLK and the AH is full of opportunities for people who want to make a nice profit just by disenchanting stuff, having access to a Jewelcrafter / Blacksmith / Leatherworker will make your life much easier for that. <br />
<br />
The goal here is to buy cheap materials from the AH, craft them into items to make a profit by disenchanting and selling the dusts/essences/shards, I'll split them into three categories: <br />
<br />
Low Level Dust/Essence Items - They yield 1 or 2 Infinite Dust (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/34054/infinite-dust/), 1-2 Lesser Cosmic Essence (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/34056/lesser-cosmic-essence/), or a Small Dream Shard (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/34053/small-dream-shard/). (Average value is around 6 or 7G most of the time)<br />
High level Dust/Essence Items - Gives 2 to 5 Infinite Dust (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/34054/infinite-dust/), 1-2 Greater Cosmic Essence (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/34055/greater-cosmic-essence/), or a Dream Shard (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/34052/dream-shard/). (Average value should be around 20 or 25G)<br />
Dream Shard Items - Disenchant in a Dream Shard (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/34052/dream-shard/). (Average value is 10 to 20G depending on your server)<br />
<br />
The most profitable professions to craft these items are :<br />
<br />
Blacksmithing<br />
Disenchant from Blacksmithing mostly uses Cobalt Ore (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/36909/cobalt-ore/), that's a good thing because it's also something you can buy without any risk depending on your server. When you have enough cobalt you can craft : <br />
<br />
Horned Cobalt Helm (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/54949/horned-cobalt-helm/) and shouldn't cost you more than 10 or 12G in mats, 10G profit.<br />
Notched Cobalt War Axe (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/41243/notched-cobalt-war-axe/) is also a high level essence/dust item but is a weapon and gives one or two Greater Cosmic Essence (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/34055/greater-cosmic-essence/) 75% of the time instead of dusts. This is very important because if you also disenchant items from other professions you will usually run out of essences before you run out of dusts. 10G Profit as well. <br />
Deadly Saronite Dirk (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/55206/deadly-saronite-dirk/) is also interesting now that the price of Saronite has dropped. If saronite sells for 65S/ore on your server it shouldn't cost you more than 10G to craft this dagger, if Dream Shards are enough it's another 10G profit for each dagger you disenchant. <br />
<br />
Leatherworking<br />
Borean Leather (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/33568/borean-leather/) is also a risk-free material depending on how low it is on your server and let you craft a few more items to disenchant. <br />
<br />
Arctic Boots (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/50948/arctic-boots/) is a low-level Dust/Essence item and its crafting cost should be around 2G50S or 3G ... disenchants into 6 or 7G of materials. <br />
Dark Iceborne Leggings (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/60611/dark-iceborne-leggings/) requires 24 Borean Leather (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/33568/borean-leather/) and 5 Crystallized Shadow (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/37703/crystallized-shadow/). Most of the time it won't cost you more than 10 or 12G to craft this item, another 10G profit each time you create an item. <br />
<br />
Jewelcrafting<br />
Oooooh Jewelcrafting ... What would I do without you. First you will need a LOT of Eternal Earth (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/35624/eternal-earth/) and Eternal Shadow (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/35627/eternal-shadow/), then you can buy all the Bloodstone (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/36917/bloodstone/), Chalcedony (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/36923/chalcedony/), Sun Crystal (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/36920/sun-crystal/) and Huge Citrine (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/36929/huge-citrine/) from the AH below 1G or 1G50S depending on your economy. <br />
<br />
Crystal Citrine Necklace (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/58141/crystal-citrine-necklace/), Sun Rock Ring (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/56194/sun-rock-ring/), Crystal Chalcedony Amulet (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/58142/crystal-chalcedony-amulet/) and Bloodstone Band (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/42336/bloodstone-band/) are low-level dust/essence items and shouldn't cost more than 3G or 3G50S to make, once again it's a 3G profit everytime you craft and disenchant an item (and you will usually craft 100 or 200 of them at a time) <br />
Shadowmight Ring (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/58146/shadowmight-ring/) is very profitable and shouldn't cost you more than 10 or 12G. Disenchanting will yield 10G profit (again.)<br />
<br />
And we're done with disenchanting! There are a few other items worth disenchanting but the ones I listed above are what I used to make money. You can easily figure out a few more ways to make money out of disenchanting by yourself at this point anyway. <br />
<br />
If you end up crafting a lot of items, you might want to use this macro to disenchant all these items just by pushing one button :<br />
<br />
/cast Disenchant<br />
/use Bloodstone Band<br />
/use Crystal Chalcedony Amulet<br />
/use Sun Rock Ring<br />
/use Crystal Citrine Necklace<br />
/use Shadowmight Ring<br />
/use Dark Iceborne Leggings<br />
/use Arctic Boots<br />
/use Notched Cobalt War Axe<br />
/use Horned Cobalt Helm<br />
<br />
At this point, you can either sell the reagents at the AH or .... make even more profit out of them by selling enchants! <br />
<br />
Selling Enchantments<br />
Selling reagents directly at the AH isn't a very good idea if you start disenchanting a lot of items because you will eventually crash the prices if you try to sell everything you have. Crafting Scroll of Enchantment is a nice way to get rid of your reagents fast and make an extra profit if you're lucky. <br />
<br />
There is just one simple rule to make sure you don't waste your time, never sell your scrolls for less than the reagents cost, even if it's a way to get rid of them faster the goal here is to make more money, not less.<br />
<br />
This is where you will first use Quick Auctions. This addon will automatically scan the AH and post / cancel your items based on the criteria you set for each one of them, you can also set criterias for multiple items at once but you won't do it for the Scrolls of Enchant. <br />
<br />
First, type &quot;/qa config&quot; and go to General to set a few settings for ALL items, my config is :<br />
<br />
Undercut by: 10s<br />
Treshold Price: 9999g (This is only here to make sure that I don't lose money if I forget to set a price on something). The treshold price is the minimum price required to post an item.<br />
Fallback Price: 9999g (Same). The fallback price is the price the addon will use to post the item if you are the only one selling it at the AH.<br />
Fallback After: 500% (Same)<br />
Bid Percent: 100% (I don't really like the idea of having a much lower bid than a lower buyout, I just keep that to 100%) <br />
Post Cap: 3 (Don't flood the market)<br />
Items per Auction: 1<br />
Post Time: 48 hours<br />
<br />
Now move to the Item groups sub-menu and create a new group for one of the scroll you want to sell, like the one for Enchant Chest - Powerful Stats (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/60692/enchant-chest-powerful-stats/). <br />
<br />
Create a new group called &quot;SoE - Chest - Powerful Stats&quot; in the Item groups sub-menu and click the newly created group on your left.<br />
Change the Treshold price to the materials price of the enchantment, in this case 4 x Dream Shard (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/34052/dream-shard/) (20G each) and Abyss Crystal (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/34057/abyss-crystal/) (50G each) will set your treshold to 280G.<br />
Change the Fallback price to 2 x materials price, a 100% margin might seem huge but it works most of the time.<br />
Click the &quot;Add item&quot; tab and click the Scroll in the list to add it to the items affected by these settings<br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/september/powerfstats_settings_small.jpg (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/september/powerfstats_settings.jpg) http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/september/powerfstats_additem_small.jpg (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/september/powerfstats_additem.jpg)<br />
<br />
That's it, everytime you click &quot;Post&quot; at the Auction House the mod will automatically scan this item, check if the lowest price is above your treshold, and automatically list it if it's the case. If nobody sells this item the addon will just post it at your fallback price. <br />
<br />
The problem with scroll of enchantments is simple, they all have different reagents requirements and you will have to create an item group for each scroll. It will take one hour of your life and depending on how fast the economy evolves on your server you might have to modify the prices every now and then but that's something I never did in 2 months.<br />
<br />
Calculating the reagent cost of each item will take a little more time .... But I'll be nice and share the spreadsheet I use with you, just change the reagents cost on the right and print the new prices before you go back in game to create all your groups. <br />
<br />
You can download the .xls (Excel) Spreadsheet (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/september/Enchantements.xls). (If you don't have Excel, OpenOffice (http://www.openoffice.org/) will open it without any problem)<br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/september/enchantspreadsheet.jpg (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/september/Enchantements.xls)<br />
<br />
You will end up with 60 or 70 groups depending on how many enchants you sell, just keep the scrolls in your inventory and go to the AH. <br />
<br />
Go to the Auctions tab and click &quot;post&quot; at the top of the panel.<br />
The addon will scan the auction for all the items that match an item group in your inventory ...<br />
After scanning, it will automatically split the stacked items in your inventory and list all of them.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/september/qa_post_small.jpg (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/september/qa_post.jpg) http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/september/qa_scan_small.jpg (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/september/qa_scan.jpg) http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/september/qa_postfinal_small.jpg (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/september/qa_postfinal.jpg)<br />
<br />
Here you go, all your auctions are posted and the money will start flowing in your mailbox in a few hours! You can also create an item group to sell reagents at the same time if you want to get rid of them even faster. <br />
<br />
After a few hours, go back to the auction house and push the &quot;Cancel&quot; button at the top of the panel, it will scan all your auctions to check if someone undercuts you. When it's the case, Quick Auctions will automatically cancel the auctions, just run to the nearest mailbox and get your items back before relisting with the &quot;Post&quot; button. Pushing 2 buttons is all it takes. <br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/september/qa_undercuts1_small.jpg (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/september/qa_undercuts1.jpg) http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/september/qa_undercuts2_small.jpg (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/september/qa_undercuts2.jpg)<br />
<br />
When you will have enough money, I suggest that you just keep 5 scrolls of each enchant at all time and restock every few days depending on how fast you sell them. Of course it doesnt apply to weapon enchantment, you shouldn't have more than one of them because immobilizing a lot of money is always a bad idea. <br />
<br />
And I think we're done with Enchanting ... The original plan was to also write something about Inscription but I think I'll wait a few more days before throwing another wall of text at you. See you next week?</div></div><hr />

I totally agree but if a large amount of people used this guide (which as i said was very detailed and well wrote) it could potentially crash the economy especially on large realms like my own with plenty of gold farmers bringing the prices down as it is. Considering you're such a respected member of the WoW community and you release a guide with proof of how wealthy it made you, players will most likely use it and those who are not used to playing the AH could bring down the prices to quick if their items are being undercut.<br />
<br />

However i never posted this freely for people to use. I wanted to, but i appreciate that if everyone does it, then it stops being profitable. Now there will be more demand for materials which will mean higher costs and lower profitability. In short i kept this between friends purely to keep it profitable, i fear you have just made the whole method of making gold a lot less profitable.</div></div><hr />

u dont need addons to make gold. i never used auctioneer and i made 20k in a 4 days without it, by figure these things out by my self.. if ppl are stupid enough to sell things for 3g when u can craft something for it worth 10 they can only blame themselves imo..

<br />
Seriously though, it's good to see something like this getting posted on MMO-C. It's just a bit mood as every player and his brother will be doing this and per se this way of making gold is already dead. BUT the smart players will learn a lesson and hopefully be able to find other ways that works the same way.<br />
<br />
I myself is a JC that's rich enough to pay for the rest of my wow career, and yes I used addons. But I can promise you that without addons like QA, commodities will be much much more expensive than they are curently. Imagine an economy where glyphs generally are 100g if on the AH at all, epic gems 300-400g (again if on the AH at all) and the list continues. Those addons are what keep the big auctioneers sane, and thus goods on the AH at a reasonable price.</div></div><hr />

The techniques posted require quite some time. When I did money a time ago I spent max 30 mins per day on AH (gems, boe items, darkmoon cards, etc.), and I didn't make excactly as much gold as the OP per day. Anyhow, imo you cannot make a guide for making gold, and if you do so it will require techniques that take way too much time. Sharing knowledge about it will also quickly result in non-viability, since too many people will be doing it. <br />

<br />
Also: it's been said once but I will repeat it. Vanish is broken and it has been known as broken for a very long time. The balancing of Rogues has been a process that has taken place in parallel with the brokenness of Vanish, and that brokenness has been taken into consideration during Rogue development. If they fix Vanish so that it is more effective, then Rogue power increases. As we have already seen, Rogue power is currently based on a broken Vanish. In order to maintain the current balance, it is inevitable that Blizzard will introduce a nerf to compensate for the increase in power a fully functional Vanish will entail.<br />
<br />
I hope that's clear to anyone who's tempted to post about Blizzard nerfing Rogues to compensate for a FIX.</div></div><hr />

To those complaining that AH will be ruined: TBH, theres been tons of AH guides out there, and I've never seen AH being ruined from one day to another, so I really doubt there will be any massive changes.

But you know, (and I know that you know) - if everyone's doing the same it stops being profitable and the market shifts.

Auctioneer have never been blacklisted by Blizzard (it would also be very VERY easy for them to detect it) - Gatherer on the other hand is questionable since it's able to &quot;intercept resource nodes&quot; which is not allowed.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
There are NO bannable addons. Everything that uses .lua scripting inside the game is not bannable. Everything that works outside the game is.<br />
<br />
<br />
not quite true, it is possible to do things with an addon that Blizzard specificly does not allow. For instance it's possible to make an addon that scans the AH for what auctions you have up, check it against a predetermined list, craft the missing bits and post them - with the push of a button. Or an addon that mills/prospect all herbs/ores for you with one click, or just DE all of one type.

Everything they are not happy with they change in the api, not banning people that use it (and they changed it many times with addons that allowed auto-combat, auto-run via specific route or decursive for the extreme examples).

Don't share amazing SECRETS with every noob out there. Peons have to keep grinding mats for us-smart-players so we can make tons of gold (in few days) while they die mining, herbing, killing stuff and questing. Please let smart-clever players be the rich ones, while noobs-newcomers just farm mats endlessly and put them on AH for insanely wrong prices. <br />
<br />
Please keep in mind that sharing SUPER TOP SECRET tricks to make TONS OF REAL VIRTUAL MONEY can offend and disappoint someone. Clever-players deserve to make money without sharing any super TOP SECRET way to use the auction house. Peons have to keep grinding completely unaware of how much fun can be playing on AH.</div></div><hr />

The problem is, right now, 0.1% of the playerbase is making money just because they found the right mod or the right guide. It's been going for years and I figured it might be a good idea to make it even for everyone instead of just exploiting the same mods again and again. <br />

In my opinion u help nobody sry. poor ppl will lose in the next weeks their money and get poorer trying to make money like u posted in your guide and ppl with money will find another way to make money maybee also on the cost of the 99,9% u tryed to help</div></div><hr />

There are allready enough guides like this one out there in the internet everyone who really wanted to find one was able to find one. I see only the Problem in the fact that when a popular site like mmo champ posts sutch a guide it really will hard influence the economy of all servers <br />
<br />
<br />
Yeah, I've thought it over, but thanks for the tip. At the very worst, making this information so widely available permanently undermines these ways of abusing the economy to generate gold. This'll no doubt open other avenues for savvy players to screw over those with less business acumen, but hopefully players like Boubouille will continue to counter this trend by posting updated information on how it works.<br />
<br />
All this guide has done is level the playing field somewhat, so that more people are able to take advantage in the quirks in the trends of WoW economies. That's a move towards taking the power held by a very few and spreading it around to more people - that is, it's a move towards greater equality. Naturally, I expect the more right-wing Americans amongst us to scream COMMUNISM while they desperately scrabble to horde as much wealth for their own personal gain as possible... just before they tell us how important equality is.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eleg</div><div class="date">2009-09-28, 11:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Very nice guide :) However, I reckon most players who are serious about earning in-game gold already are very familiar with using their crafting professions, the AH, and Auctioneer/QA2, to do so.<br />
<br />
But now a lot of WoW players have got some of the gold earning methods served on a silver plate. I am sure lots of them will give this a try. Some will see relative successs, while others will find there are too much competition. <br />
<br />
Even then, the &quot;casual&quot; gold earners will soon find themselves lagging behind again. Simply because it takes ongoing efforts to keep a gold earning business successful. Crafting and AH work require quite some time. It also takes time to stay current on the different item groups' cycles of high/lows for selling/buying. Patches do introduce changes which people will need to be prepared for. The list goes on... and time and efforts are needed. Something many are not prepared to invest. They would rather spend their time raiding or doing PvP.<br />
<br />
The smart ones will always be ahead. Possibly the OP did stock up his banks with Cobalt/Saronite ore and eternals before making this post public? ;D I wont be surprised to see the prices of these go up today...</div></div><hr />

<br />
A few of these already don't work on my server. Eternal air is 20g and dream shards are 12g, so even though saronite ore is 65s, that particular item is a loss to turn saronite into shards due to the 4g price of 2 crystalized air. I'm sure NONE of them will work on my server by mid-week due to prices readjusting to the new common knowledge. :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">methuselah</div><div class="date">2009-09-28, 11:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's amusing to see all the QQ about the WoW economy ruined by one new gold-making guides posted on top of the hundreds that are already available. Sure, there might be a few new players who try it out for a few days, but after a week most people are back to their old patterns. Humans are creates of habit and it does take some discipline and structure to set up and run this kind of gold-making schemes efficiently. I would claim any idiot in WoW can make huge amounts of gold by simply spending the time in game, the interesting part is your gold/hour rate. <br />
<br />
Surely you will earn gold by following these guides, but remember they are still very mainstream and well documented, open to everyone and a bit tedious. The biggest gold earning opportunities in terms of gold/hour are still within interfaction trading (because people can't be arsed), controlling supply by moving upstream and sign up the bigtime farmers (because people don't think of it) and capitalising on the natural variations that are always there on prices over the timeline (because most traders are sitting with Auctioneer which fails bigtime at giving you good timeline data). And of course the biggest opportunity of them all is when Blizzard launches a new patch which brings the market out of its equilibrium. Make sure you always think outside of the box, make sure you are the one defining the rules for a particular market instead of just confining yourself to the norm. <br />
<br />
One example of patch changes being profitable on top of your regular trading maneuvers is the Crusader Orbs becoming BoE in 3.2.2. Here is one example on how to make quick gold at zero risk: You notice the Crusader Orb prices are 725 gold and 1050 gold on alliance and horde factions, respectively. You type WTS 4x [Crusader Orb] in the horde trade chat. You instantly find someone during peak hours eager to craft their bracers and negotiate the price to 975 gold/orb. You tell the buyer you will fetch the orbs from an alt and will be right back. Buy the orbs on the alliance side and transfer them to your horde character in about 60-90 seconds. (Yes, easily done if you know how to with multiple accounts, a clever mod/macro setup and fast loading times.) Sell them to the buyer without any auction fees. That's about 250x4 = 1000 gold profit with zero risk and a 5 minute investment just by using an opportunity that is sitting right there.</div></div><hr />

Hello Boub,<br />
honestly, i don't think that your post's gonna change something.<br />
As a calligraph, i win a LOT of money. I already tried to explained to my guildmates how to make money easily. Only one tried for few days, then give up.<br />
The ones playing with AH are the same for years, using auctioneer since vanilla for most of them. The others prefer to spend their time doing dailies or gathering ressources or stuff like that.<br />
I'm almost sure that those using auctioneer today will win more money tomorrow by following your advise.</div></div><hr />

Until recently I made mine by crafting and selling high-ticket items. Sash of Ancient Power cost &lt;2k in mats and sells for 3-3.5k every time. I had been selling 3 a week but I've a feeling people have moved on from it now and the price of Spellweave went up after the Crusader Orbs became more widely available and everyone went after Merlin's Robe and the Bejeweled Wizard's Bracers.<br />
<br />
Here's a tip for enchanters: The highest profit scrolls are the top vanilla enchants. The MC healing enchant is a goldmine and Crusader is valuable as well. Twinks and BoA items, gotta love 'em.<br />

<br />
I'm not using any addons I am earning a lot of gold by disenchanting some of stuff you pointed in that guide. I bet many others will now do it too. You don't need addons, it just saves time spent splitting stacks, buying etc, but it's not a must.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Seriously, it's only the same information that is available to everyone with a simple google, why does it makes you angry that a higher profile community site puts them available? You do know that exactly the same stuff is written all over at www.wow.com (not worldofwarcraft.com ) and a lot of other community sites, right? I didn't see anyone screaming that their server's economy was ruined because of this...<br />
<br />
Stop saying Boubouille is ruining the economy by posting a simple and clear guide, it's his f.ing job to bring up interesting information about WoW... He only posted something that was on a lot of other sites but still lacked on MMO-Champion...<br />
<br />
The economy wont be broken or crashed, it's simply that all this easy profit will be spread amongst more different people, it wont make the economy worst.</div></div><hr />

I think I'd much rather enjoy making gold than treat it like a job.<br />
<br />
Because your fellow raiders would expect you to use any orbs to maximize your performance in the raids. Not to leech along to earn gold. And if you already have raided that much that Emblems of Triumph can't provide you with any upgrades, I reckon you treat raiding as a job ;)<br />
<br />
When it comes to doing daily heroics, or even just heroics, for emblems... they are just new hamster wheels set up for us by Blizz. From the gold earning perspective it takes too much time... and is lacking any challenges.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The problem is, right now, 0.1% of the playerbase is making money just because they found the right mod or the right guide. It's been going for years and I figured it might be a good idea to make it even for everyone instead of just exploiting the same mods again and again. <br />
<br />
But yeah, I'm not stupid, I know I killed the market on most of the servers for a few weeks, it will eventually come back to normal as soon <br />
<br />
What about us, who are making gold without addons, using same method by discovering it ourselves?<br />
I'm making maybe 200-300g per day using disenchanting method, it's not gold farming but its enough for repairs and reagents for raids.<br />
Guess I'll have to find some other way or get back to dailies :&lt;</div></div><hr />

First of all anyone who didn't see how player made items could be DE'd for significant profit is either unconcerned with making money (in which case they won't be following this guide for very long) or not looking for how to make money and just looking for some mystical IWIN button. In the later case anyone serious about making money has a huge opportunity to exploit everyone just running to the AH blindly following this guide.<br />
<br />
Secondly and more importantly the guide's suggestion on how to make money is highly flawed, its nothing more then AH camping. Admittedly highly automated AH camping which makes it slightly more time efficient however in the long run AH camping is not a particularly viable strategy on a money vs. time basis. Certainly running to the AH every hour mass canceling everything which has been undercut and reposting will allow you to sell most of your stock the time spent per gold (especially with the amount of people about to start AH camping scrolls) will likely be quite low. In the short term AH camping can be somewhat viable but the most effective way to make money is as part of a long term (if you consider a month+ as long term) strategy to gain a fair degree of control over a given market.</div></div><hr />

then tell everyone how great you are by doin this and then tell everyone that u dont like that ppl take this advantage and earn this kind of gold.. man you just did, and now when you have enough gold for the next 2-3 years u really dont care..<br />

I agree completely camping the AH to make sure you are always the lowest price on a given item is a complete waste of time, thats why this guide is somewhat less useful then people seem to think. However to say that the only people making significant amounts of money from the AH are no-life campers is inaccurate. The most successful people at making money on the AH are not those who rapidly cancel their auctions and repost them but people with a system (most likely highly automated) which allows them to make significant money with only a small amount of semi-afk time.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nam</div><div class="date">2009-09-28, 01:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Interesting guide. I personally never used that method, I did not expect that much money in it. Seems like I was wrong! Of course, this will have some major impact on server economy because the site is so popular, but who cares? It doesn't change the amount of gold made this way, it just spreads it more. And it is by far not the only way to make game money - basically, you can almost sell anything on the AH. And even the information is not exactly new, there are many blogs and wow-sites with threads related to AH-moneymaking. <br />
<br />
And finally: The prices for ores did NOT skyrocket, it's just that every ore that had a reasonable pricing has been bought and blacksmithed now. The market will calm down again after a while when most of the people who read it here don't want to sit at the AH anymore and will go back to their daily quests.</div></div><hr />

Nitpicking, but nothing is unlimited in the world of computers.<br />

Possibly 1844674407370955g 16s 16c if it's not signed, I can't really think of any reason to be able to set a guild bank to negative. A GM can set gold to negative on players so we need a 32-bit signed integer, but can't see any reason for it on banks. But maybe Blizzard wants it to be signed anyway.<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit: To put it in context.<br />
<br />
Let's assume it's 63-bits. Let's also say that you earn 50000 gold every single day. It'll still take you 506778683343 years to reach the guildbank cap. Our sun is estimated to live another 5 billion years. So, to reach the cap you'd have to farm gold 500 billion years after it has died. :&gt;</div></div><hr />

Assuming is always bad ;) but I agree that they'll probably use a signet long, BUT the reason I said there's no limit is that number is so high that no-one will ever get that amount of gold in a guildbank, hence it's pratically unlimited.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Information on this &quot;strategy&quot; has been up since WotLK's launch. Whether on EJ, here, wowhead forums, or official forums it's been bandied around.<br />
<br />
Yes, the markets on big servers will tank for a bit. Maybe even longer than a few weeks as the people who couldn't think of this on their own (or with a little prodding) will keep buying up over-priced mats without realizing how much of a loss they're taking (they'll either lose it on the front end with the mats, or backend with constant undercutting despite the disclaimer of never selling for less than mats. People see an auction not be bought once or twice and they get antsy).<br />
<br />
The reason why this has continued to work throughout the entire expansion is that people are impatient. This entire process IS simple - but it can be time consuming and tedious unless/until you have a streamlined effort. This is going to take a new person at least a few hours (especially with learning auctioneer) if not longer and the day to day process itself can take anywhere from 30 mins to 2 hours.<br />
<br />
For people who can't even be arsed to make a spreadsheet to calculate their potential earnings on the fly will burn out and give up this strategy fairly fast.<br />
<br />
And for those of you who were already savvy enough to have used this, or a similar, process - I'm sure you're savvy enough to have other methods of making gold in addition to this sector of the AH. Quit acting like this is your only profitable venture.<br />
<br />
Either use your alternative methods for the time being, or figure out a way to exploit this knowledge being known. The enchanting market always seems to &quot;right itself&quot; regardless of knowledge being known because there is always a demand for the mats.<br />
<br />
Even when that one JC'er on official profession forums posted his huge guide on how to make money with JC'ing...it ended up affecting the market for about a day. I might add that it had exactly this same information in it in regards to using disenchanting.<br />
<br />
Additional note - if you're planning on leveling JC/BS/LW/Enchanting for the sole use of this guide - you're too late. Have other plans in mind for using those professions by the time you max it out. As it is, look for leveling mats for those professions to be seriously jacked up as a major fallout of this.</div></div><hr />

People forget that first you need some gold if you wanna make a lot money from AH. Sorry to say but &quot;average&quot; player can't compete with me. I simply can sell dusts/essences without any real profit next few days and those people will see that its not so easy to earn a lot gold because their profit gonna be small (how many dusts you must sell if you earn only 20s from one dust? ;). They will leave AH and start to farming herbs/eternals/orbs again. Prices go up and I start to earn again. Simple.<br />
Tip: if you aren't ready for real competition on AH dont start even. <br />
People wait for inscription guide. Its not so easy thing with glyphs because you need rare glyphs if you wanna earn gold. So be ready to spend some gold buying Books of glyph mastery (price will go up prolly). And don't forget that best glyphs have to be discovered (long cd). So good luck with it. Scheme for glyphs is easy (quick auctions addon and AH camping)-without any problem you can earn 10k gold/week. But you must spend a lot time camping and don't think that people are gonna be intrested with it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And guess what happens if the market dries out of herbs and the glyphs are at max 10g each. The competitors get out of the market and they are whining &quot;What that guy on mmo said it's not right i can't make money !111!1!!&quot;.

<br />
<br />
Please don't imply anything... As I don't know you personally, it goes without saying that my comment was a general one. Raiding guilds do perform differently. Some guilds do the leap from T8 to T9 easily, while others have to use any means available to be able to progress. In the latter scenario, and considering raiding is a joint effort, I would consider it very greedy if a player sells possible upgrades for gold. <br />
<br />
People are also different. In fact nothing is more different than people :D You enjoy raiding, and will probably not see it as a job whatever amount of hours you put in. The same applies to many of the players who are busy earning gold in-game. They simply enjoy another aspect of the game.<br />
<br />
Personally I earn gold to support my raiding. If I during a progress phase can improve my performance just slightly by buying a BoE/crafted item, I don't have to hesitate a second to spend the necessary gold. Having some gold also enables my to do the same for guild mates :)<br />
<br />
And all this fuzz is not about spending hours to earn 50s on a few items. I have seen similiar pipelines as described in this guide producing 3 gold for every 1 gold put into them. If you invest a couple of thousands, the returns are nice :) And while some people indeed are AH campers, I think most people try to minimize this. I tend to post my auctions late in the evening. Then hoping to find typically 1-2k gold in my mail when getting home from work the next afternoon.<br />
<br />
I will close by saying most of the QQ-ing in this thread seems to come from people who fear that their static &quot;earn lots of gold&quot; button has been taken away from them. To do business you have to adapt. Any changes or impact to an economy will provide opportunities. So while people are complaining that the price of Infinite Dust is going down the drain, they should be happily stocking up while it is cheap. What goes down, will come up...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Everyone who works the AH like this never produces anything of value. You never mine ore or get herbs. You never go kill stuff just to skin it. You only remove value from the system and hoard it at the top.<br />
<br />
Most of you AH jockeys are complaining that prices will go up. Several people actually seem to think they are doing a good deed by &quot;keeping prices low.&quot; That couldn't be further from the truth. The average player goes out into the world and farms to get money for things like repairs and reagents, which have set values that can not be changed. If their 5 stacks of ore can be sold for twice as much, they can farm half as long. You aren't helping anyone.<br />
<br />
Guides like this aren't useless because &quot;everyone is using them.&quot; They are useless because all the people mining, herbing, and skinning see it and SWITCH to this method. All those people you were feeding off of are now trying to feed off others. Think about what you are saying when you suggest that people purchase ore or leather off the AH that are LOWER than their vendor value, take them out of the mailbox, then head to the nearest vendor to REMOVE THEM FROM THE GAME WORLD. Someone put in time to get that and it is essentially worthless. That is what you are doing to the economy.<br />
<br />
You can not make that much gold without victims of your greed. When the prey become predators, there is nothing to prey upon. This is why your profits stop.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i dont see any advantage at all - the author of this guide says it himself: &quot;because I realized that gold wasn't really useful&quot;.<br />
and thats so true: after ur epic flying skill (which u can pretty easily obtain by just completting the remaining questzones after u hit 80) nobody cares if u have 500g, 5000g, 50000g or 500000g<br />

the time u spend on setting up all this addon config stuff and crafting/disenchanting and so on u could also spend on one of the more than enough easy daily quest available.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Tell that to the people who go about questing or farming and get a boatload of crappy greens (+spirit on plate armor? AWESOME) that rot on the AH.<br />
<br />
Who buys them, transforms them into something that almost EVERYONE uses, and puts it back on the market?<br />
<br />
You think if every server didn't have people doing this that the market would be better? So that there would be a flood of raw materials and really really crappy unwearable greens and blues at rock bottom prices?<br />
<br />
This is all part of the interplay that makes the AH meta work.</div></div><hr />

The vast majority of the WoW player-base won't even have the attention span to read through the entire article, let alone actually take the time to setup and properly use the systems described. Nevermind the fact that simply having the tools doesn't do anything for you, without a working knowledge of basic economics you won't make any money.<br />
<br />
There's a reason every server has a handful of people with more gold than they know what to do with. All these tools and methods have been common knowledge for years.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The problem is, right now, 0.1% of the playerbase is making money just because they found the right mod or the right guide. It's been going for years and I figured it might be a good idea to make it even for everyone instead of just exploiting the same mods again and again. <br />
<br />
But yeah, I'm not stupid, I know I killed the market on most of the servers for a few weeks, it will eventually come back to normal as soon as people forget this post ....<br />

They're all going to move to Inscription next week anyway. ^^<br />

first: the Economy cant be ruined, your money making system can be- and apperently was, but not the economy.<br />

Everyone who works the AH like this never produces anything of value. You never mine ore or get herbs. You never go kill stuff just to skin it. You only remove value from the system and hoard it at the top.<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
<br />
The lack of economic comprehension here is depressing. <br />
<br />
How can people can live their entire lives in a modern nation and never grasp the basic concepts of the system that allows them to spend their afternoons sitting in front of a flat-screen monitor they could not have built discussing a piece of entertainment software they could not have developed with thousands of other equally wealthy and free humans all around the world they haven't met? Apparently the people who created these monitors, video games and internets are contributing nothing of value and only &quot;hoarding at the top&quot; because they &quot;never mine ore.&quot;<br />
<br />
Adyssa, in the world you apparently wish we lived in, you and I would be subsistence farmers spending every summer worrying our kids would die of malaria, and every winter praying not to starve. <br />
<br />
Put simply: A system in which everyone dumps piles of unfinished materials on the AH for 10cp each is NOT a better economy for anyone involved. The process of breaking down and refining those materials into goods, competing over prices between multiple parties, and ultimately re-investing the wealth generated from said competition is the only reason it's even worth bothering to put materials on the AH in the first place. It's also the only reason you and I live the lives of luxury that we do.<br />
<br />
I don't mind Bou posting these &quot;secrets&quot; here at all, if only because it might open a few eyes to the complexity of what's really making all of this work. That... and I learned about QA. :P</div></div><hr />

Even though, I knew alot of the stuff, I learned some new tricks!<br />
<br />
To those complaining that AH will be ruined: TBH, theres been tons of AH guides out there, and I've never seen AH being ruined from one day to another, so I really doubt there will be any massive changes. It may help lowering the prices a bit, making some mats cheaper, and easier for you to make a good amount of gold on your professions. See; It all works out either way :)<br />
<br />
My respect to you Boubouille, for this amazing guide :)<br />
<br />
<br />
ur wrong every time someone post a guide for quick gold ( example: mytwocopper blog ) the market just get rushed with Undercuts until its no longer profit to make those items. <br />
<br />
<br />
=/ right now i want to punch Boubouille fase.<br />
<br />
also Boubouille u forgot the Tailoring,,, netherweave bags :D add it hehe. 10g profit each bag<br />
<br />
<br />
and no one its going to make gold with this guide :P inb4 40 pag of Illusion dust 3g each</div></div><hr />

<br />
And even if you do have a gatherer, once again, this is not the &quot;quickest way to make money&quot;. It is actually pretty time consuming for both crafting+de'ing. Not to mention the AH camping for maximum profits (re-posting after undercuts).<br />
<br />
The easiest way, and the way that most people make obscene amounts of money, is to simply quit assuming people are as smart as you.<br />
<br />
WoW idiots (through ignorance or impatience) make people thousands of gold everyday.</div></div><hr />

<br />
People who bitch about how their market is ruined still don't understand how the market works. In a few weeks, the casuals are still poor (because they lack the stamina to invest the time needed over a longer period) and the smart people have always other ways to rip them off anyway. Mat prices are also going to stabilize lower again once the dumb masses realize that you can't make gold this way now everybody knows how to do it:<br />
<br />
The more people you have, the bigger is the chance that there's at least one moron who brutally undercuts the established prices so much that there isn't much profit left - not because the player is malignant or cares the for the masses, but they're just plain stupid.<br />
<br />
All in all, it was nothing more than a massive trolling:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The problem is, right now, 0.1% of the playerbase is making money just because they found the right mod or the right guide. It's been going for years and I figured it might be a good idea to make it even for everyone instead of just exploiting the same mods again and again.<br />

On some servers, borean leather, cobalt, etc. doesn't sell for beans. If people start to apply the principles in this article on those servers, farming those mats will start making money again. i.e. all the below-vendor-price items will be gone and prices will have raised across the board.<br />

I believe you're quite right. The whole idea behind a gathering profession is to make money from it (and supplying a tradeskill with mats), however when you don't earn anything anymore because the AH prices are too low and there is an abundance of your goods, something like this is needed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Maybe I overlooked this, as I don't have time (between classes) to read all 14 pages of the thread, but... what sort of bizarre, magical, fairy-world server does the fellow who wrote this guide play on? Literally every item in the guide that one would purchase to resell/vendor junk for money sells for as much as 2x+ that amount on my terribad server. Cobalt is 25g a stack for bars and 30g a stack for ore, and Borean Leather is 11g per stack. Then again, I play on a veerrrrrry old server, and our economy has been borked since forever.<br />
<br />

So much fail. <br />
1) You gather items = profit.<br />
2) You use items either gathered by you or bought from AH (since they have exact same value) with crafting profession = profit.<br />
1 + 1 = 2, not 3. 1 = 1, not 0. Every profession is enough to make money, having 2 where other uses another doesnt multiply your profit, 1 + 1 = 3 you say ;D<br />

This man get it, sadly the rest of you so called businessmen don't.<br />
<br />
Seriously people this isn't ruining the market in a major way, it is simply causing a shift in the market. A truly savvy businessman would look at this article as a huge opportunity to make money, you have a decent idea of how the market is going to move in the near future and you can relatively easily get ahead of it.<br />
<br />
To help those of you busily spouting doom and gloom out a few ideas. Obviously this is going to increase demand for scrolls so scribes should be able to make a killing on this. <br />
<br />
You say you don't have a scribe, just an enchanter? Thats fine, the post shows people that high level enchanting can make significant money, how will many people read this? To make money you should be/have a high level enchanter (obviously this isn't what the article says but many people will read it that way). So people think they need a high level enchanter, what will they do? Level enchanting, which will of course increase the price of low level enchanting mats. TADA, you just found a temporary niche market, congratulations. Now quit bitching about &quot;ruining your market&quot; and make some money.</div></div><hr />

The true value of this guide is 1 or 2 things and certainly not to &quot;help&quot; clueless ppl as this just floods it and no1 make money but the true value of this guide is<br />
<br />
1. Gain traffic to this site<br />
<br />
and 2 as some say to fill his own pockets some more by stocking up on the things he've said is good to buy and resell/craft item and DE, tho I personally dont believe number 2 as that would just be too low to do.<br />
As for nr 1 he has achieved it by far and can try to feel good about himself for doing it in this manner. What ever rocks the boat is good for him, bad for some but he dont see any responsibility towards us so good luck with next weeks piece on inscription to ruin it some more for us.</div></div><hr />

the thing is, the turnover ratio of people that learn this and actually apply it to make some serious gold is really bad. they typically do it long enough to get something like an epic flyer or a nice buffer for repairs while doing their dailies to upkeep it. <br />
<br />
it really is a joke that some people are upset over this. the only real issue i can see with people is if he did buy up all these mats for weeks before posting this to gain from it. but i dont think the purpose was to do that. i have more faith in the character of the people that run this site.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The more information any individual has on the more perfect it will get. Now everyone who was farming and actually doing something to get gold before he knew this will start acting according to the article. What follows is that the prices will go up until it is arbitrage free meaning that you can't make any money of of this anymore.<br />
<br />
For example: Buying one item and disenchanting it and selling the disenchanting mats will give you the same amount as the item sold for. Meaning no more free gold :).<br />
<br />
Now stop crying about it. It's what all capitalistic markets (especially the US) is built upon. Simple economics really.<br />

<br />
Opportunity Cost (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_cost)<br />
Just because you gather an item yourself does not mean the item is &quot;free,&quot; you lose the associated profit if you had sold the item thus your net profit is no greater then someone who bought the item.</div></div><hr />

If its possible with the wow-api, and does not give cross-faction communication. Then it's allowed.<br />
<br />
Anyway, to my original posting intent:<br />
So i read this guide, was quite happy with looking at those risk-free investments, go to my nearest auction house and what do i see? Borean Leather going for 60 silvers and Cobalt Ore for 2g each. My server's economy is horrible D:</div></div><hr />

He writes &quot;Change the Treshold price to the materials price of the enchantment, in this case 4 x Dream Shard (20G each) and Abyss Crystal (50G each) will set your treshold to 280G.&quot;<br />

None of these methods will make any serious gold, and showing how to make gold using these techniques to everyone will just devalue these particular methods.<br />
<br />
Nice for me though, the ways i make gold will inevitably increase value since everyone will be doing what this guide says :D</div></div><hr />

next time reinforce your thoughts before sounding smart. Example: answer why it ruins the economy instead of just saying it ruins the economy and also explain why this guide wont work instead of just saying it wont work.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The only way to &quot;make&quot; gold is by looting mobs and quest rewards.<br />
The AH only &quot;moves&quot; it. Which means it's coming from somebody else. All this post is going to do is balance the server economy, which was his original intent. There will still be just as much gold per server and as much coming in as usual. Maybe less since people might give up daily grinding to try to play the AH.<br />
<br />
If you wanna make a profit you have to rip somebody else off. :P Economics 101.<br />

You're all just pissed people will be more aware that they're being ripped off now. :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just by posting this guide, literally thousands more people are going to be doing this now, which in essence completely screws this guide over.<br />
<br />
You'll notice the prices for a lot of this stuff will go up preventing people from buying mats, crafting stuff, selling to vendor for profit and even buying items at cheap and selling back to vendor for profit.<br />
<br />
It's good advice and a good guide, I won't take that away from you, but you seriously just screwed people over that have been doing this for a long time thus reducing the amount of profit made prior to this guide :-\.<br />
<br />
Ignore Golgolath, obviously doesn't know what he's talking about, as a lot of the stuff in your guide is great &quot;get money quick&quot; stuff.<br />
<br />
I transferred servers on one of my toons, neglected to give him money prior to the transfer [shut up.] Once I realized this, I did about 1/2 the things mentioned in the guide and made 1,500g in 1 day.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
Powerful Stats requires 4 Dream Shards and 4 Abyss Crystals fyi. Even if he listed it as &quot;4x Dream Shard and Abyss Crystal&quot; did not mean &quot;4 Dream Shards and a single Abyss Crystal&quot;.<br />
<br />
20x4 + 50x4 = 280 not 130</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haxxored</div><div class="date">2009-09-28, 05:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">All you old time AH players, especially those of you claiming to have been raking in gold hand over fist for months / years, need to chil out. This guid is great a well written bit on easy ways to make big bucks, BUT it's all marketed on the idea of a lax AH and easy server economy.<br />
<br />
What this guide will do is, it will wreck the markets. Borean leather / cobalt ore prices are going to rocket up so every single batch is above the guide threshold value making collecting and mass DEing prohibitively expensive. On the other side disenchanted materials are going to stagnate as a fresh surge of DEed crap pours in from thousands upon thousands of players eager to try out the new tactics.<br />
<br />
Results, both new and old AH farmers are going to take pay cuts and suffer gold decreases. The good thing is old school AH traders are going to know how profitable the tools really are and despite the down turn are likely to stick with the program even through it's poor performance (possible net loss). The new comers, however, are going to be severely disappointed. In many cases they dropped old professions, lvled up one of the most expensive and time consuming profession in the game, invested time in learning and following a new program and ended up poorer than when they started. After that big of a let down I doubt many follow up on the system.<br />
<br />
So you old time players, you may see 10 times more competition in the short term but within a few weeks it will be down to 2x the volume and probably by the end of the year markets will have stabilized and if your still dedicated the money is still there. It's not hard to do it just takes a bit of preparation and daily effort, sadly that's more than the majority of WoW players care for.<br />
<br />
In the end it takes a special type of person to amass huge gold vaults most people don't want to put the effort in simply because after 30-45k gold having bulging pockets doesn’t really do that much for ya.</div></div><hr />

it doesnt work for everyone.. prices for the mats is too high on my server..<br />

with a little care one can still reap a medium profit, although some markets (like enchanting) just won't be profitable anymore for a 1-2 months :ç<br />
all in all a bad move for the market (for it will hurt old ah-ers, and won't help new ah-ers since those methods won't be working as good), a good move for the site (reaping visits i guess)..</div></div><hr />

It's the basic stuff though, he didn't get to the more advanced parts or making gold like posting times and griefing competition to make them stop or controlling prices so for the &quot;real&quot; AH people, theres no threat fortunately.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Addon that scans the AH - check<br />
Addon that crafts against a presetup list - check (sort of, it just craft all glyphs so you have a certain number in total of each - point is, it's possible)<br />
Addon that mills/prospect all - it's already done with a &quot;craft all&quot; for profession, so I'd say it's possible (besides Enchantrix can detect DEable/millable/prospectable mats and popup to ask you, again making it do it automaticly is trival)<br />
Addon that post on the AH based on a setup - check<br />
<br />
If all those addons already exists then chaining then is only a matter of inconvience. So here you have it, it's possible to make an addon like that with the current state of the API.</div></div><hr />

RE: some of the QQ about how Boub &quot;ruined&quot; the economy by posting this guide. <br />
<br />
Some of you need a better understanding of economics. <br />
<br />
Economists talk about &quot;perfect information&quot; and &quot;perfect competition.&quot; A market is perfectly competitive when all parties know all relevant facts about a particular product. <br />
<br />
Imperfect information in an economic situation means that some people get less than the best deal they could and their opposite party gets a better deal than if the other side knew better. <br />
<br />
The &quot;facts&quot; that boub revealed, for example that when crafted into a Cobalt Triangle Shield, Cobalt has a vendor price of 1g38s per bar. <br />
<br />
Someone who sells cobalt for less than 1g38s presumably has imperfect information, or does have perfect information and is willing to take a discount off that price for some reason. (for example they don't want to find a blacksmith to craft those shields). The more people that know this, the more perfectly competitive the market gets. <br />
<br />
This won't drive prices down, it will only drive prices up. When prices get higher, you need to consider whether you can make more money being a farmer or a reseller. <br />
<br />
So, the market gets more competitive, now it's really hard to find cobalt for less than 1g38s on the AH, and this avenue is taken away. But before you could only sell your cobalt for about 20g a stack (less on my server), now you can sell it for at least 27.6g a stack. <br />
<br />
This is what you're missing. The idea of opportunity cost. Boub may have made certain activities less profitable by making them more competitve. But others are now going to get more profitable. <br />
<br />
Some people, when they play wow, will try to farm everything themselves. <br />
<br />
Others, will run dailies (or play the AH or whatever other sources of gold) and tend to buy nearly all of their mats off the auction house. I would assume most of us do something in between. <br />
<br />
If you're smart about trying to earn money, you'll think about how much time you spent doing one thing, and figure out if you could make more money doing something else. <br />
<br />
Also, if you're like me, you probably have lots of mats stocked up. If the prices of cobalt and shadows and earths have skyrocketed when i get home from work today, guess what I'm doing? Boub may have just made me a couple hundred gold.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bigjenk</div><div class="date">2009-09-28, 06:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Lol its blatantly easy to make money if tons use this guide most of you only know your one way though because someone told you how to do it and your not sure how to play the economy.<br />
<br />
Just like the recent economic times guess what lose a little in the short term profit hugely over a slightly longer span if your smart.<br />
<br />
Most of the people who are qqing that mouthbreathers are gonna ruin them are those same mouthbreathers that someone smart told what to do step by step.<br />

So think about farming Cobalt/Borean Leather instead, and hold onto your enchanting mats for the time being, or make them into enchants directly.</div></div><hr />
