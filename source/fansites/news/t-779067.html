That's what I'm saying. I'm not getting it digitally; going to a midnight launch. But I don't remember WOTLK like that; as soon as I got home I installed it and played it by 12:45 EST. It's pretty lame if us East Coasters have to wait until 3AM.</div></div><hr />

Last class for D3 is ranged, which is predictable.<br />
PvP arenas for D3, which is not really exciting, since it's already an instanced world.<br />
Official Blizzard maps which are ripoffs of maps that other people already developed is super lame. How is that in any way creative?<br />
A new &quot;charity&quot; paid pet is good for people who like to spend real money for pets. I don't get it, but clearly other people like them who so good for them I guess.<br />
<br />
Hopefully the D3 gameplay presentation is about more than just the Demon Hunter.<br />
<br />
Edit:<br />
<br />
Er, it will probably be about the demon hunter and arena PvP. Ugh.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Diablo games have always had a PVP element to them, and it was always a bitch to deal with because of the dupers and hackers and asshats. Now, instead of being forced to deal with that bullshit, you can choose to PvP in the arena or not. Just because it has the title Arena doesn't mean its E-sport crap.<br />

Considering Blizzard is a PST company, I've never understood why they give the edge to east coast players like that. Pacific players still had to wait until midnight unless they either got it from 7-11 (I would be surprised if 7-11 gets to carry Cataclysm after the crap they pulled with Wrath) or they got it off digital download. In any other case, East coast players had a 3 hour head start. As opposed to doing it this way, when everyone will be starting at the same time.</div></div><hr />

One can only imagine your level of excitement if they had announced Warcraft themed socks. I mean ZOMG WARCRAFT SOCKS!<br />
<br />
If this is all they had to announce, then fine, that's all they had to announce. I'm not saying they should make stuff up or that they have an obligation to drop my jaw, but still these announcements are pretty weak.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Nah, I don't give a crap about the WoW movie, and I don't care too much about their unannounced MMO until there's some gameplay to look at, which given their glacial pace of development in general, we probably can't expect to see for another few years. Regardless of what any one expected, it's still a weak bunch of announcements, mostly because they're all easily predictable or just kind of lame (DOTA map is a big deal, really?)</div></div><hr />

For example, if I'm browsing the site in Finland does the timetable show what time the events happen in my local time (GMT+2 that is)?.</div></div><hr />

To quote the main page, which if you scrolled down slightly you could see this for yourself...<br />
<br />
<br />
All times are converted to local time automatically, and you have a countdown anyway.<br />
<br />
Yes, the times are converted to YOUR time. If you read the time table you could see that it shows &quot;11:00 to 23:30&quot; at the top, and then immediately under in that column, it shows a completely different time; those are the equivalent times in your time zone..</div></div><hr />

i was really expecting something with their new IP i was pretty sure they were going to release info on this blizzcon :(</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Demik</div><div class="date">2010-10-22, 08:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We all start playing at the same time anyway. lol at people with the &quot;PST gets it earlier&quot; attitude. Digital pre-order is great for me, i can go straight home after work (midnight) and play. Without having to stop on the way home to pick the game up. It's the only way to do it fair. Otherwise east coast will be playing 3 hours before anyone on the west coast can legally sell the game. midnight PST is the only way to do it so that everyone can play at the same time. If you're that mad that you have to raid a few hours, you're the type that's going to play all night anyway. You were going to be up at 3am anyway that day.<br />
<br />
Because of sites like the one we're on right now, there is nothing new to announce as far as WoW. That's not a negative comment, but between data mining and BlizzCon falling only 6 weeks before release, we couldn't have expected too much. BlizzCon is for the fans, they aren't required to make major announcements. I'm sure we'll get some info on our games. Funny that after an hour, all the &quot;omg cool!&quot; we could expect is done. Without any &quot;omg cool!&quot;.<br />
<br />
If you don't want pvp in Diablo...don't play it. They're not taking people off the regular game to develop pvp, it's seperate teams. There's no reason not to want pvp. Since when are extra features a bad thing?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I thought that this was supposed to also contain info about other games? I remember a while back where Boub wrote something regarding a different mmo because someone pointed out the fact that the website's name was MMO-champion and not wow... Not that I care, I am here for wow only, but I just wanted to point it out, and perhaps get an answer as to whether or not it is correct to call this a wow website? :)<br />
<br />
But darn, I'd like to be there for the Demon Hunter! xD</div></div><hr />

That's the fairest thing possible.<br />
Midnight sales will obviously not exist anymore (at least in most parts of the world).<br />
<br />
Blizzard's digital downloads are usually more expensive than physical copies in shops while being cheaper in &quot;production&quot;; plus the revenue is not shared with any other (trading) company. So a very smart move profitwise.</div></div><hr />

You mean like teleporters in old dungeons, normal modes of old dungeons being revamped, the editing/streamlining of old world dungeons, the interactive maps, the new Diablo class? Yeah I knew about all of that last week but I decided to buy the stream anyway /sarcasm.<br />
<br />
If you guys hate listening to the developers talk to the community or whatever that's fine, I thought the live raid was pretty awesome on top of all this new info, and you never get patch changes presented like this outside of Blizzcon.<br />
<br />
(Selfish, Immature) Haters gonna hate.</div></div><hr />
