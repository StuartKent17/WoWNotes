That's another issue, though it has less to do with drop rates and more to do with how the quest can reasonably be completed. We came up with a &quot;parallelization&quot; concept where a player could be on phase 3 of making Dragonwrath, while another raider in the same group could be on phase 2. We thought that would feel better for the players involved, and it did, but more because they were getting their staves faster than for any other reason. The real problem with this idea is that it made it very difficult to balance the time investment it takes to create a staff. The first staff might take x amount of time to create, but then subsequent staves could potentially come out the door a lot faster.<br />
<br />
Legendaries aren't very legendary if 20% of the raiding population is carrying them -- never mind the ripple effects that their presence can have on game balance in PvE and PvP. Ultimately, 'parallelization' made a too powerful item, too easy to get, too quickly. In short, it was a mistake that we regret, and one we won't be repeating in the future. It also left us with a situation that we needed to address, though, which is why we nerfed the quest item drop rates to begin with.<br />
<br />
All of that is merely by way of explaining how we arrived at this point. The heart of the issue for many of you has been 10-player raid drop rates and I’d like to take a moment to thank those of you who provided clear, constructive feedback in these threads and elsewhere. It’s been really valuable during our deliberations and helped us arrive at a decision that we think will address our concerns and yours.<br />
<br />
We’ve decided to revert the drop rate change for 10-player heroic Firelands completely. We’ll also be slightly buffing the drop rates in 10-player normal. In the end, we should get the following results:<br />
<br />
<br />
25-player heroic has 44% lower drop rates in phase 3 relative to 4.2 launch.<br />
25-player normal remains unchanged from 4.2 launch.<br />
10-player heroic remains unchanged from 4.2 launch.<br />
10-player normal has 33% higher drop rates in phase 3 relative to 4.2 launch.<br />
<br />
<br />
We plan to hotfix the new rates into place as soon as possible, and we should see them in-place pre-raid this evening barring unforeseen complications.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, I was going to try to explain to you why this change was necessary, but then I realized that you likely think you're better than 90% of people who dare play this game with you, so you can just keep on crying that Blizzard balanced a questline to at least allow 10-man raiders to get a legendary before 4.3 comes out.</div></div><hr />

Now a guild that runs 3 10 mans will have 3 staves in the time a 25 man guild gets 1. GG. This is really freaking fair. Another reason 25 man raiding is going to die because casual scrubs demand access to the same legendaries at nearly the same rate as 25 man heroics. nearly every caster will have this legendary in 10 man raids, while maybe 1/3 of casters will have it in 25s.<br />

Total essence per week should be the same between 25 and 10 man guilds (right now its .7 essence / raider in 10s, .38 / raider in 25s). Way to fucking go.</div></div><hr />

Seriously, since ICC legendary item is nothing more than something better then average weapons. It has nothing to do with popularity or how much is it avaiable. Like epic stopped being epics, legendaries stopped being legendaries. They better get their wants straight, cause I see two opposite logics in here. Why is it that epic are avaiable to everone with no effort, but legendaries must be so damn difficult to obtain? Why so big gap between those?</div></div><hr />

Its ok because in the hardcore raiding community we all recognize 10m as not being equivalent as 25m. So if ever there was a World First 10m kill of Say Deathwing it would be such a lul fest. Until the 25m get the real kill. Same thing as Normal and heroic encounters no one cares about reg kills its all about heroic content.</div></div><hr />

Because this (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0An699vGZwDtZdHVzVWhIYnhqQmxfaTZYQUsyRk1qNWc&amp;hl=en_US#gid=0) was the way to go, amirite? 25s already had quite an advantage prior to the nerf. I know that, on Horde side at least, one guild already has 2 of the staff and working on their 3rd (with a second horde guild well into on their second). 10-man really was getting the shaft, and I'm happy that Blizzard has changed their mind somewhat on the nerf.</div></div><hr />

Nice strawman. I'd waste time explaining why you're wrong on several fronts, but being blinded by your ego means you wouldn't comprehend the logic. It's irrelevant though, change has been made, deal with it.</div></div><hr />

Well considering you called me casual, when I've come from a guild that's on the same level of progress as you (well except doing t11 when it was relevant content but I digress) so clearly if 6/7 is casual to be competitive you must be 7/7 amirite?<br />

So by the time a 10 man guild completes their first staff, a 25man guild will have 3 completed and a fourth one to be completed the next lockout.<br />

Same thing as Normal and heroic encounters no one cares about reg kills its all about heroic content.<br />
By the time three 10-man raids get each 1 staff (total 3), a single 25-man raid will have 3 staffs already completed and fourth one started. Look at the spreadsheet datat in this chain.</div></div><hr />

Why? 25 man guilds are still in the same position they were in yesterday, that is, it is still faster to obtain the staff in 25 and an appropriate proportion more can be obtained.<br />

That wouldn't be smart until you have at least 2 people backlogged on the final step of the quest. Until the final step of the quest, 25 mans still have a vast advantage over 10-man collection rates. It's just in a few months, your last 4 casters will be standing in line with their 391 staves waiting to syphon the bosses. When that point comes, then you should break off into 10 man groups.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes that makes perfect sense... lets stop being able to farm different quest items for multiple people at the same time (essences for 1st, cinders for 2nd and embers for 3rd) at a much faster rate than 10 man (this has never changed), and form 10 man groups where each of those 3 people will farm each of their quest items SLOWER than they would if they had stayed as 25 man. You're logic is undeniable.</div></div><hr />

10's might get 2 staves if they really push it. 25's would have been equipping all of their casters with them. Even now 25's will probably finish the tier with 4-5. 25's getting 7-10 staves would have been ridiculous. 10's getting ZERO staves would have been equally ridiculous. This fix works.

What about the 25 man guilds that were forced into 10 man raiding because they lost a chunk of their raiders to the shared loot system? Doomhammer EU used to have over 10 25 man guilds that were killing heroic modes in Wotlk, as soon as Cata rolled around, the vast majority didn't survive to see the end of T11 heroic and now, there are maybe 1 or 2 left. All the progression guilds have now been forced into 10 man raiding because of the reason stated above.</div></div><hr />

Heroic modes in WotLK were a joke with Citadel Buff. People aren't forced to do anything, if you have a dedicated group who can actually work together.. then it's less about items and more about community.

Oh isnt a threat or anything we are just weak atm as 25 man guilds and we keep disbanding. We already lost more then 60-70 % of our guilds compared to wrath. Its a simple truth and things like this decision dont help us. <br />
<br />
Again i dont mind the reversal of the 10 man %. Shouldnt nurf ours though. <br />
<br />
I dont want to say anything really bad and get banned but how hard can it be to calculate and know exactly how many legendaries guilds on 10 and 25 will make? And adjust before 4.2 and avoid all this confusion?<br />
<br />
I was 5th on my guild on 25 i ll probably wont make it now since we recently started working on our 2nd. I honestly dont mind for me since i always view loot as a tool and not a perk and despite loving the shinies i can leave without them also. <br />
<br />
But changing the game mid tier and without heads up/interaction is bad. I am just tired of all the hate and 10/25 and normal/HM and nurfs/buffs and bugs/hotfixes bla bla bla. <br />
<br />
Game just feels like an endless beta after Ulduar i just dont have teh energy to deal with it anymore personally. As a 5 year old raider i am just tired.</div></div><hr />

Don't forget that there are 5 dps in a 10-man raid and 17 dps in a 25-man raid, so the droprate should be 3,5x higher (and only 2x higher for an healer weapon and should be the same for a tank weapon)</div></div><hr />

You do have to remember that if the 4.3 raid comes out at the end of this year, Firelands will still only have lasted half as long as ICC did, and you would have been able to gather even more staves in that period than you were able to get shadowmournes over the course of a whole year.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This has close to nothing to do with the situation at hand.<br />
When WLK was active content there was a difference between 25 and 10 in terms of loot distributed so unless you felt ok with lower iLvl loot when a guild started to struggle on attendance of members they either merged or disbanded so the players could look for a new 25 man guild.<br />
With shared loottables that situation changed into a guild suffering in numbers being able to change to 10 man since the loot was the same anyways.<br />
I've been part of a recruitment team at the end of WLK and the beginning of Cataclysm and I can tell you that trying to recruit in WLK was sometimes a pain. Trying to recruit in Cataclysm was a straight down nightmare.</div></div><hr />

Didnt see anyone bitching about it then. My guild made 6-7 SM's at least and we where 600-700 or so top guilds made more.<br />
What does 6-7 SM's mean when you've been there for nearly a full year ? You should compare what can be compared. You're crying because you won't get as many staves as SM's ? That won't happen because Blizzard changed the droprate, it will simply happen because we won't spend one year in FL.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Stage 1 - Eternal Embers<br />
Regarding to the google-spreadsheet, we get 0,8 Embers in 10m and 2 in 25m on average.<br />
This sums up to 31 needed bosskills on 10m and 12 on 25m.<br />
<br />
Stage 2 - Cinders<br />
If we look again at the spreadsheet, we get 24,5 in 10m heroic and 60,5 in 25m heroic<br />
leaving us with 41 bosskills in 10m and 17 in 25m.<br />
<br />
Stage 3 - Essences<br />
Previous to all the changes, we got ~8 in 10m heroic and ~18 in 25m heroic.<br />
So 32 bosskills in 10m and 14 bosskills in 25m were needed.<br />
<br />
As you can see, the bottleneck was stage 2, which took the most time in both raids.<br />
<br />
Time needed for the first legendary:<br />
10m: 104 bosskills<br />
25m: 43 bosskills<br />
-&gt; 2,41:1<br />
<br />
Time needed for all further legendarys:<br />
10m: 41 bosskills<br />
25m: 17 bosskills<br />
-&gt; 2,41:1<br />
<br />
BUT NOW - with the change(!) - the number of essences for 25m heroic got nerfed to 9,5.<br />
For the 250 essences you now need 27 bosskills and so the new bottleneck for 25m is stage 3 whith 27 bosskills.<br />
<br />
Because of that, the time needed for a further legendary is now:<br />
10m: 41 bosskills<br />
25m: 27 bosskills<br />
-&gt; 1,52:1<br />
<br />
I would not be surprised if 25m-Raids would now be &quot;forced&quot; to run 10m to optimize stage 3.<br />
The only correct way to slow down the &quot;droprate&quot; of the legendary whould have been to reduce the droprate of the cinders to tighten the previous bottleneck.</div></div><hr />

Considering 25mans clearly DO NOT get 4 times the amount of drops from 10man I would love to see the math behind that statement... <br />

It would be fair if we got 2.5x more drops considering the numbers between 10 and 25... but that's clearly too obvious for bliz to realise. If they pander to the 10man population well they wont hear as much QQ in comparison from the 25mans because they're slowly snuffing us out.</div></div><hr />

And that is where it's at right now, 25man guilds are few and far apart now cause there is such a small incentive to do 25man atm, ppl will chose the easier and less of a hassle route which is doing it on 10man.

<br />
But stick to your guns and you get changes like these, the tiny upper hand ratio wise 25man had on 10man for doing something harder, just got reversed into the favor of the whiners xD but hey, qq hard enough and blizz will change it for you for the very reason I quoted Estral.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">F-Minus</div><div class="date">2011-09-08, 11:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm actually appalled at most of the posters here; you're hating on Blizzard because they made a Legendary item too easy to get -- what's the purpose of getting a legendary item if it's easy to get? Anyone remember Ulduar farm? Atiesh? Thunderfury? Those items were legendary because of the time you put into getting it, not because it was practically given to you due to an easy drop rate. 10 man guilds that complain, should discuss the counter-intuitive nature of 10 man raiding -- it's not meant as a focal point, by WoW game design; it never has been or we wouldn't need 25 man raiding. It was implemented as a means to ease access to raiding to those who couldn't gather 25 people, or 40 for that matter. Majority of posters need to back off the high-horse of self-entitlement of the &quot;because I pay, I deserve&quot; attitude. I pay for my cell phone service, but I don't ask the provider to wipe my derriere when I go number two.<br />
<br />
Actually it's the other way around &amp; why compare old legendary items to the current one? What's int he past is in the past or are you reflecting back at how people cooked water when you're taking a shower. This game is a MMO it's evolving/changing, what was once working might not work this time, what was once popular might not be popular now etc. They have to cater to the masses nowdays cause they have 10 times more competition from other games as they had back in 2005. Of course they will give the Legendary to more people and of course that means it's going to be available a lot easier. <br />
<br />
As for the 25 vs. 10 debate, why even go there. You see with your own eyes, if you're not blind, that the majority of former 25 guilds is now defunct. Where there were 10+ 25 guilds on a server in wrath and before, now you see 2 to 4 or even less. My server has 2 25 guilds and we had about 15+ in Wrath, everything else is 10. And the future ain't looking bright for the 25s. <br />
<br />
The way the game is set-up right now from Blizzard. People doing 10s are just as much important as people doing 25s.<br />

And you were forced to join/run a 25 guild? No? Then why complain about how hard and time consuming it is to run one? <br />
<br />
I bet it's also harder to lift 25kg as opposed lifting 10kg. Shit, I just hit me, the world makes sense now. And that is exactly why a lot 25 guilds of wrath switched to 10, cause the constant handling of the guild got annoying and you get rid of idiots on the way.</div></div><hr />

Theres a lot more to it than that.<br />
<br />
Put it this way, a 10 man strict guild will only now be getting into the smoldering essences portion (last week was the earliest I think). By the time the first 10 man strict legendary is crafted, any 6/7 heroic 25 man guild will have 3 staves, maybe even four. Do you know why? its because you can have people at multiple places much faster. 6/7 Heroic guilds have 3 players done with cinders by now (again, probably nearing a fourth, maybe even a fifth) There is a huge disparity. Its not about catering to casuals, really any raid group thats reasonably successful should have a chance to get one legendary before the next content patch comes out. How many bad tanks do you know who got thunderfury? How many bad guilds finished shadowmourne after the 30% buff let them kill LK normal? Its not about the catering to casuals because casuals were going to get their legendary eventually anyway, so why are you whining that they get it at a slightly faster rate compared the the assembly line of 25 man legendary crafting. No guild will immediately switch to doing 3 10 mans to supposedly get more legendaries, because thats not how it would work out and 10 man also gets a lot less loot. When you only have 2-3 drops per boss, you tend do DE a lot more shit because you don't need leather gloves number 5 for your one rogue.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The reason why its okay for the third part to just be slightly better for 25man is this:<br />
When you have one person working on the 3rd part, you only have one. So splitting into 3 10man is not helping, because you're bottlenecking your secondary staff maker, and also bottlenecking the third one. <br />
The only situation for 25man where splitting is good optimization, is at the point where your 7th, 8th and 9th staff wielders are making their staff. At this point we're looking at 50% of your raid having one.<br />

<br />
So. the difference between doing 25man and splitting into 2 10s is...exactly the same, give or take a week based on RNG? <br />
So, math proves that 25man are splitting hair over nothing.</div></div><hr />

One earlier poster mentioned that this changed the bottleneck to phase 3, that is where it belongs, see below.The progression through phase 3 is now very close to equal between the 4 brackets of raiding. (10n, 10h, 25n, 25h) The benefit of having the bottleneck at phase 3 is that when the staff is created there will be less or no boss kills in which no smoldering essences are obtained. (Due to no one being on that stage of the quest)Now for the enjoyment of the readers and to save us all some time, I'm going to quote the 25man raiders QQ'ing counter-argument in advance, following which I will preemptively counter that argument.&quot;We need to break into 3 10man groups now because when our raiders are on phase 3 and hit the bottleneck because then we can get THREE raiders through phase 3 in the time it would take us to get MAYBE 1.5 through in our 25man group!! OMG?!&quot;In order to justify splitting a 25man group into 2-3 10man groups because it would optimize phase 3 of your quest gathering, you FIRST need to successfully get 2-3 raiders UP TO phase 3 but not started with it. If you switch before you have 2-3 raiders at phase 3 but not started, then you're just lowering your other raiders progression through phase 1 and 2, (Because you dissolved your 25man group in order to run 10mans remember?!) If you could now refer to the first paragraph, you still complete phase 1 and phase 2 significantly faster, with the bottleneck now now occurring at phase 3, it is theoretically possible that if you raid Firelands for almost forever, you could get to the point that splitting into 3 10 mans would be ideal. Please be aware that when I say 'almost forever' I mean it. On my pocket calculator I'm running the numbers and it seems to me it will take 14 weeks (about 13.5 but remember this is pocket calculator and mental math) for the first raider to finish phase 2 (their cinders) and have a person ahead of them that has also finished their cinders but has not even begun their smoldering essences. At this point you could split your 25man group into 2 10man groups in order to theoretically get 2 in the time the previous group would get 1.5, but remember this is after you already have 3 legendaries in your arsenal and comes at the cost of at least 5 of your raiders (more if you have a bench for optimal fight compositions) due to their not being room for them in the 10man groups. In order to increase the queue of people to THREE that are waiting with their cinders completed and still one in front of them you are looking at TWENTY-SEVEN WEEKS before it is optimal to split into three 10man groups to increase legendary production. 27 weeks is 6.5 months. 6.5 months puts us towards the end of MARCH next year, if Firelands is still a 'progression' raid by then and you haven't completely run out of casters to give the legendary to, then by all means, split into 3 10man groups.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Do you really think that having a heroic/regular version of it would be better? If it was only available for heroic guilds, then only 2 or 3 guilds per server would have one, but each guild would have every caster decked out in them by the end of the patch. That doesn't really make the item any more elite or rare. The masses would just get them in the next patch after the next level of handouts. Your 'fix' doesn't really fix anything, and that's coming from someone who hates the casualization of raids and loot handouts.<br />
<br />
The only legendary that has never been casual accessible was Atiesh. This one will still be fairly rare while it's the best caster wep, but by the end of Cata everyone will have one. That's the only issue I have. Blizz specifically made this one so that as many people could get it as possible. If everyone has it, then it's not 'legendary.' It doesn't make sense from a mechanics standpoint (unless casters will receive a nerf across the board in the next patch) and certainly doesn't make sense from an in-game story standpoint.<br />
<br />
<br />
It is not. It's better for 10m, because in the time 10m can complete 1 staff, 25m are only able to complete 1,5 staffs, while having 2,5 times more ppl.<br />
<br />
No one should be creating legendary items at 2.5 times the rate as anyone else. What part of mass-producing legendaries makes the weapons legendary?</div></div><hr />

What's this?! By the time 10man makes their first, 25man is well into their 3rd staff (A.K.A They got 2.5 legendaries)<br />
<br />
Sounds likes its working as intended, but it does have a bit of a bottleneck when we get to 7th+ staff. A small nerf to Cinders with a small buff to essences could change this but otherwise, 2.5 times.</div></div><hr />

So, math proves that 25man are splitting hair over nothing.<br />
<br />
You may have misunderstood the math being presented:<br />
<br />
The first spreadsheet represents the best case 6/7H (or 7/7H) for 10/25 groups<br />
(let's ignore that only ~1300 out of ~29000 raiding guilds (about 4%) are even able to do this presently):<br />
(I can't post urls :p) docs.google.com/spreadsheet/lv?hl=en_US&amp;key=0An699vGZwDtZdHVzVWhIYnhqQmxfaTZYQUsyRk1qNWc&amp;hl=en_US&amp;f=true&amp;gid=0<br />
<br />
The second sheet represents if the 25man group splits into 2 10man groups <br />
(let's pretend the extra 5 people would be left to do nothing and wouldn't raid again):<br />
(I can't post urls :p) docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0An699vGZwDtZdFJOTUh1U3J4MTl4QUhCX0lVNVEwOWc&amp;hl=en_US#gid=1<br />
<br />
The first shows at 6 months, a 25 man (top 4%) guild continuing to run 25 man raids will accumulate, on average 5 staves.<br />
The second shows that at 6 months, a 25 man (top 4%) guild switching to 10 man will accumulate, on average 6 staves.<br />
<br />
The math presented dictates that, because 6 staves is more than 5 staves, they are not exactly the same. <br />
<br />
Note that we cannot &quot;give or take a couple weeks&quot; because we are working with average drop rates already and RNG has already been factored into the calculations. (It would be more accurate if it had argued that a lucky 25 man group might possibly be almost the same as an average pair of 10 man groups).<br />
<br />
Given that a 25 man raid that splits into two 10 man raids to finish staves will end up with 20% more staves, I can not agree that this is just splitting hairs over nothing (not that I'd be getting one personally anyway). <br />
<br />
Let's step back for a bit and look at the effect of some of the assumptions in these spreadsheets:<br />
<br />
- Only the top 4% of raiding guilds (those currently raiding Firelands) can achieve atleast 6/7H, for the other 96% of guilds, the 33% buff to normal 10 man essences tips the scales a more for the already favored the &quot;split to 10 man strategy&quot; presented.<br />
<br />
- Let's take it one step further and not even look at guilds that do not have access to heroics at all: ~11500 guilds have access to heroics, so only 11% able to produce best case results, leaving 89% of the &quot;heroic guilds&quot; to be affected by the 10man normal buff on essences.<br />
<br />
- Iterate on that, if you believe that is too lax, 3250 guilds are 3/7H (half the available essences done on heroic)... even 60% of the so-called (loosely used) &quot;hardcore&quot; guilds are affected (obviously to a lesser extent)... etc, you get the picture.<br />
<br />
- If we extrapolate the results so that we aren't &quot;wasting&quot; the 5 people that are now orphaned by the split groups, to two 25man raids versus five 10man raids, we'd end up with 10 staves for the two 25man raids, and 13 staves for five 10man raids. Don't forget that this is modelling the elite guilds that are farming at least 6/7 heroic, once you are 5/7H and below, the 10man normal buff starts to skew the results towards the 10man stave strategy.<br />
<br />
Notes: The caveat here being I'm not even a caster, and I am not in the 4% that this spreadsheet even applies to (technically, not even the ranks of Paragon went 6/7H in the first week), so this doesn't really even affect myself directly, I am merely putting things into perspective for those that take the &quot;give or take a couple weeks&quot; for granted when dealing with the data presented.</div></div><hr />

What I don't get, is that because players/ guilds have an inability to keep members in guild groups to access 25 man content; and for that reason alone, Blizzard needs to cater to your needs. That's not Blizzards problem, that's a player problem first and foremost. I know plenty of guilds on my servers that run 25m content, and heroic, including my own. Don't project player problems on the shoulders of those who can't fix those problems. They can only do so much, the rest is up to players; it's called a reciprocal, and distinctly symbiotic, relationship.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It would be fair if we got 2.5x more drops considering the numbers between 10 and 25... but that's clearly too obvious for bliz to realise. If they pander to the 10man population well they wont hear as much QQ in comparison from the 25mans because they're slowly snuffing us out.<br />
<br />
Completely ignoring the fact that most 25 man guilds have already completed one and are working on or close to two already. Selectively picking bits and pieces of data and ignoring the overwhelming evidence that 25 man guilds could pump out a new legendary every 2-3 weeks at the original droprate and the prime cause was allowing quest stages to be completed concurrently in 25 man which they never should have done thereby making each staff take 6 weeks to complete from the first one to the fourth one and it already taking 3-4 months to complete 1 staff in 10 man based on the drop luck of your cinders. 25 man guilds will have completed exactly 5 staves in the time it takes 10 man guilds to complete 2. That's exactly 2.5 to 1 balance. After that, 25m guilds may have a claim to increase the drop rate but with 4.3 confirmed for 2011, it'll be the middle of January before that happens and the staff will probably be irrelevant by Week 2 of 4.3.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Finally they found out a mistake made to 10m raiders.<br />
Good to see it, maybe even I - 2nd in our line for staff will get a chance to get one before 4.3, or at least at the first month after 4.3.<br />

This isridiculous. Now 25 man heroics will have 2.5x as many players with the 391 staff, but will be getting the completed staff at the same rate as 10 mans nearly. 9-10 essence is way to big of a nerf in comparison to 10 mans. Now a guild that runs 3 10 mans will have 3 staves in the time a 25 man guild gets 1. GG. This is really freaking fair. Another reason 25 man raiding is going to die because casual scrubs demand access to the same legendaries at nearly the same rate as 25 man heroics. nearly every caster will have this legendary in 10 man raids, while maybe 1/3 of casters will have it in 25s.<br />
<br />
Total essence per week should be the same between 25 and 10 man guilds (right now its .7 essence / raider in 10s, .38 / raider in 25s). Way to fucking go.<br />
<br />
You forgot a bit about first 2 steps with 25 and 1000 fragments, didnt you ?<br />
To all 25m cryers - switch to 10m, sure, do it ! And get your 391 staff in 4 months !<br />
Anyway, all hardcore guilds have their alts and alt raids, so what the problem to switch one dpser at 3rd phase of quest chain to 10m alt raid for a month ?<br />

Hah, so they want legendaries feel legendary, and if too many people have legendary it doesnt feel legendary? Seriously, since ICC legendary item is nothing more than something better then average weapons. It has nothing to do with popularity or how much is it avaiable. Like epic stopped being epics, legendaries stopped being legendaries. They better get their wants straight, cause I see two opposite logics in here. Why is it that epic are avaiable to everone with no effort, but legendaries must be so damn difficult to obtain? Why so big gap between those?<br />
<br />
Hmmph ... probably it is time to introduce Artifact items ? Probably it would make sence - legendaries like old epics - rare and hard to obtain, and artifacts - really very rare legendary items, like Atiesh.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chaoslux</div><div class="date">2011-09-09, 07:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So, counting the whole &quot;Only 4% are 6/7 Heroic so the spreadsheets are flawed&quot; , i decided to go through and make a spreadsheet containing ONLY 7/7 Normal.<br />
<br />
There are three path in this one:<br />
- 10man<br />
- 25man<br />
- 25man that splits in 2 10mans when they get to Phase 3 on their second legendary holder. (Because there's no reason to split before)<br />
<br />
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0ApFClftiagX1dGpPTFBUNUgzMzYxZ3FQS3FGX0xOaHc&amp;hl=en_US<br />
Check the second sheet called &quot;Normal Mode + Split&quot;<br />
<br />
By the time a 10man makes a 3rd one, 25man will have 7. which is a little over twice as many.<br />
By the time a 10man makes a 3rd one, a 25man that decided to go for 2x10 will have 6. Which is less than just going straight 25. <br />
<br />
That's normal mode only of course, when you get into the heroics, there may be a viability of the 2x10, but if we look at the earlier spreadsheets by Aby-ori, considering those comes from a &quot;what happened pre-nerf&quot; this may be different as the results we would get from two teams starting clean, but still valuable. <br />
25man:https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?hl=en_US&amp;key=0An699vGZwDtZdHVzVWhIYnhqQmxfaTZYQUsyRk1qNWc#gid=0<br />
2x10: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0An699vGZwDtZdFJOTUh1U3J4MTl4QUhCX0lVNVEwOWc&amp;hl=en_US#gid=1<br />
<br />
25man get 6 staffs by Week 25, 2x10 gets 6 staffs by Week 24.<br />
We're looking at a 7 days difference, for doing something you hate (10mans instead of 25s) over a period of 3 months.<br />
Yeah, pretty much people would still do what they prefer.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I bet it's also harder to lift 25kg as opposed lifting 10kg. Shit, I just hit me, the world makes sense now. And that is exactly why a lot 25 guilds of wrath switched to 10, cause the constant handling of the guild got annoying and you get rid of idiots on the way.<br />

If it was only available for heroic guilds, then only 2 or 3 guilds per server would have one, but each guild would have every caster decked out in them by the end of the patch. That doesn't really make the item any more elite or rare. The masses would just get them in the next patch after the next level of handouts. Your 'fix' doesn't really fix anything, and that's coming from someone who hates the casualization of raids and loot handouts.<br />
<br />
The only legendary that has never been casual accessible was Atiesh. This one will still be fairly rare while it's the best caster wep, but by the end of Cata everyone will have one. That's the only issue I have. Blizz specifically made this one so that as many people could get it as possible. If everyone has it, then it's not 'legendary.' It doesn't make sense from a mechanics standpoint (unless casters will receive a nerf across the board in the next patch) and certainly doesn't make sense from an in-game story standpoint.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
No one should be creating legendary items at 2.5 times the rate as anyone else. What part of mass-producing legendaries makes the weapons legendary?<br />
<br />
Normal mode shouldn't get a legendary at all.<br />
<br />
And 10 man raids should be able to create legendary weapons at the same rate per person as 25 mans and not faster. Before they made this happen they should have tuned 10 mans properly so they are equal to 25 mans. They already get the same loot for doing easier content (I don't care if you don't agree it's just true) and the same achievements.<br />
<br />
Mass producing will happen anyway or they will have to make it extremely hard so that the top raiders get max. 3 legendaries and the guilds who are in the middle of the pack or lower get none.</div></div><hr />

Actually I'm agree. I like the way even casuals like me have a chance to get legendary, hovewer for guilds killing 6\7 normal, that are not be able to down even normal Ragnaros there shouldnt be legendary - its just does not fit. Blizzard should make essences to drop from heroic bosses only I suppose.<br />
But keep in mind, there are quite few guilds that cant do something like Shannox or Rhyolith hc - people that cant kill it wont raid together for long anyways - so they wont get legendary.</div></div><hr />

You have to down Ragnaros to get the Legendary, so you can't be 6/7 normal mode and get it. Even if you are only downing 7/7 normal, it will take you 5-6 months (or more) to get the staff. I imagine there will be plenty of guilds selling Ragnaros kills for the heart for those that don't have a guild capable of downing him, just like there were plenty of guilds selling Shadowmourne runs at LK during ICC. Why would a legendary item require HM boss kills when it hasn't before? They just drop more quest items, so those people will receive them more quickly, as has been done for previous weapons.</div></div><hr />
