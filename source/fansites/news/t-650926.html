Updated Druid Forms - Tauren Cat 
For our third installment, we'd like to offer you a look at the new art for tauren cat form. Here's a peek at the current look of cat form along with the five new textures. As a reminder, tauren will be able to change which look they use by switching skin tones in the barber shop --a new feature for tauren in the next major content patch.

[US] Compensation for the extended downtime<br />
Once we have resolved this issue and the realms are playable once more, we will be assessing appropriate compensation for the additional downtime for players on the affected realms. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/17367755578-extended-maintenance-update.html))<br />

Leviathan's Coil nerf<br />
On the topic of Leviathan's Coil, we were originally happy with the armor value. However, when we looked at it further, we realized the entire ring was over-budget. Technically, we had spent itemization budget on armor and then split the stats again as if we had not. We decided not to keep the high armor because we didn't want to set the expectation that there would be high armor rings every tier and we didn't want players feeling like they had to go back to old content to get the only high armor ring.

Death Knight tanks and cooldown<br />
As I explained, we compared DK armor, health and avoidance to other tanks, and found that the DKs ended up in better shape than other tanks even if you totally ignored cooldowns. When you consider cooldowns, things are even more skewed.<br />
<br />
I just didn't want potentially disgruntled players to perpetuate a myth that DK armor got nerfed because their cooldowns were too good. DK armor got nerfed because their armor was too good. Many players (some DKs even) argue that the cooldowns are still too good.<br />
<br />
The short version of how we got there was that some glyphs and set bonuses ended up being better or worse than we imagined, block ended up mitigating a lot less damage than we envisioned (before the Ulduar bosses actually existed), and because effective health ended up being way more important to progression than any other aspect of tanking.

Skin Tones and hair colors on new forms<br />
We're working on putting together a list of the skin tones, hair colors and their associated druid form skins. We hope to post it this week at some point after the final installment of the new art is revealed.

Mobile Authenticator Available In Europe!<br />
[blizzquote author=Ancilorn source=http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/9521232256-mobile-authenticator-available-in-europe.html]We're happy to announce that the Battle.net Mobile Authenticator (http://eu.battle.net/bma/ (http://eu.battle.net/bma/)), an extension of the same concept behind our Blizzard Authenticator, is now available in Europe.<br />
<br />
An authenticator generates a one-time password, which you use in addition to an account ID and password to log in to World of Warcraft and other Blizzard Entertainment services. The Battle.net Mobile Authenticator performs this function for the recently launched Battle.net accounts -- only instead of a physical token, the application exists on your mobile phone for easy access.<br />
<br />
The Battle.net Mobile Authenticator is now available as a free download for the Apple iPhone and iPod touch from the Apple App Store: http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=306862897&amp;mt=8 (http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=306862897&amp;mt=8)<br />
<br />
Versions for other mobile phones are also in the works for the future. Please visit the Battle.net Mobile Authenticator FAQ for more information, or head to the setup page (http://eu.battle.net/bma/ (http://eu.battle.net/bma/)) to get started after you've downloaded the application.<br />

Is that scar from lion king?<br />
<br />
<br />
It's proven that Blizzard takes from so much else and we see it in WoW. From He-Man to Voltron, well, sorta:) <br />
<br />
Also IMO the Horde Bears and now Cats all look awesome. I honestly cannot find one of each that I dislike and find myself thinking hard of which one I like the most, of Bear and Cat. Good job and I think this will add a new exciting element to the game, even if its just look, but remember... many folks take the time to put alot of work into their character. Be it Achievements, Titles or honor kills, there are those who will get great joy from this. <br />
<br />
Now we just need to see if they are going to update the Moonkin forms. That one is going to be very interesting if it happens.</div></div><hr />

As the game goes on, the graphical quality of the models is improved (but the old ones are still there).<br />

Compare Draenei and BE's to orcs and humans. See how blocky the old models look in comparison.</div></div><hr />

They are an upgrade from the old forms at the end of the day, it's great to see Blizz go back and spend some time on the class that spends majority of it's time shifted into one form or another. I've played a druid from the day I brought WoW and I've loved every moment of gameplay, this for me is a &quot;thank you&quot; for sticking with the class from Blizz.<br />
It's also going to be impossible to create forms to everybodies tastes. The nose-ring and horns are fantastic accents and fit the cat perfectly. All those who say different are just misery-guts!<br />
<br />
Gotta say I like the new designs on the Tauren models more than the NE ones, but the more subdued colours work well on the NEs. Huge respect from me in this project. Yep it's taken a while, but in my eyes, well worth the wait ^^</div></div><hr />

Worked gear into the shifted-forms. It is beyond stupid that you either PvE or PvP for sweet gear and then get stuck looking like every other noob out there b/c you are shifted into some stupid form.

Very nice detail work and great overall look. I love the nose ring, the tauren-y muzzle is genius and the studded armbands are so heavy metal!<br />
<br />
Overall the one feature that has most impressed me abut the new forms, and indeed the one that mst desperately needed changing is the eyes. <br />

Even in armor everyone looks the same in this game, there's no diversity at all when it comes to that.<br />

At least this way you'll see a few different colored druids around. Love the new models.</div></div><hr />

One thing is that tauren feral forms have horns... great.. fucking ugly.. But not with nose rings as well? .. god dammit.. just make the tauren run around on all 4 instead.... lol...<br />
<br />
I've always thought the horns we lame.. but with the nosering it's just plain rediculous.<br />
<br />
<br />
Because the transformation into the cat was from, i don't know, maybe a minotaur that had horns and a nose ring? <br />
<br />
If you thought they were going to remove the race distinctiveness from these forms, you were sorely mistaken and in a very small minority of people who dislike the look.<br />
<br />
I think it would be cool if the horn styles selected during character build translated to the cat/bear horns as well rather than the generic set, but I don't know if they will or not from just the sample art.</div></div><hr />

Sea Lion form ? your being serious ? how often have you actually used that form to justify them spending time on a graphic for that? there are 100x more things that are more important and wrong with this game that sea lion form GTFO</div></div><hr />

<br />
Obviously Blizzard wants to impress players with their new artwork and such, but the best graphical change would be to allow players to choose to wear items that look the way they want them, but not just as town gear. The designers put in the work for Thunderfury, players put in the time to obtain them. What is the harm in transferring a new tanking swords stats onto the Thunderfury model. Update your old preferred model with stats of new items. Keep proficiencies at same (no plate stats on cloth, no 2H Mace to 2H Sword, etc). It would open up old instances better than this achievement deal did. Blizz can be happy with their art staffs past and present work (well, present if it's preferable to old). Deception in pvp? disable when flagged or something... heck this is in a druid thread where we can't tell what armor you have by the looks.</div></div><hr />

Sorry to burst your bubble, but the other 2 forms look fine. This is a thread about the new graphics, and they did say they'd like to upscale all forms to the level of the swift flight form.

Well first of all... YOU don't get to decide what blizzard spends their time on.<br />
And second, who cares? They have divisions.. art division, etc.<br />

Sea lion is ugly and can use a new skin just as much as the other forms.</div></div><hr />

Actually, I said it was a re-skin and that Blizzard cop'd out by not creating models that reflect armor. How amazing would an armored bear/cat/moonkin/tree be? How much better would a druid feel about his gear that he never sees 99% of the time now? They have armored mounts (epic mounts), so why not create druid forms that reflect the gear you are wearing? Lame-ass re-skin ftw.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My gripes are the freakishly long and weird face, the fact they no longer have sabre-teeth like all the other WoW cats (though this is understandably a matter of preference), and the fact female tauren will still have a male lion look, despite asking for so long not to - at least the nelf cat looks gender neutral.<br />
<br />
Yes, it's an upgrade on the old one. But they could have come up with a better design. :/</div></div><hr />

Expecting armor on everything is ridiculous in my opinion.<br />
Custom armor on cats, bears, trees, and moonkins? Every piece would have to be recrafted to fit each of them, and that's a MASSIVE amount of work. It'd be like introducing four new species in WoW.<br />

MY complaint is that the night elf bears look lackluster in comparison to the tauren ones (top right and bottom left look similiar, don't have the details of the tauren ones), but I'm happy overall.<br />

Tauren epic flight form has horns. They fit well but they are still horns. It's the retention of racial traits for each race. It's meant to show they aren't 100% another animal but a mix of the two.<br />
<br />
The new cat form looks great. Even if they had messed it up it would look good. There was nowhere to go but up with a new skin and they went stratospheric with this one.</div></div><hr />

I'm assuming the tree and bomkin forms are next, then the travel and aquatic forms. Most people would probably prefer that order to them doing travel and aquatic forms first.</div></div><hr />

I agree with you, but... i was thinking in scale about itemlevel<br />
<br />
At level 10 with crappy gear bear can look like a bear cub... and start scaling with itemlevel and with full ulduar gear the bear can look more ferocious.<br />

I refuse to believe that Blizzard cannot, within reason, create druid forms that have more variety that differing shades of gray. These new models are, bottom line, a huge disappointment considering how long they have been promising them and how much they have hyped them. I was expecting to be impressed not underwhelmed. Elbowbands and tattoos are insufficient to count as &quot;exciting&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Especially not some of the Native American tribes, the conglomerate culture of which the Tauren aesthetic is based on.<br />
<br />
<br />
That may be, but in the case of a Tauren, one thinks of the cow nose ring first, then of the Native American piercing.<br />
But the real point is, Tauren character nose rings are optional, Cat Form ones are not.</div></div><hr />

Completely went over your heads, didn't it?<br />
<br />
I take it these are the people that started playing druids way after the release of tree/moonkin forms.<br />
<br />
A little seaform improvement would be nice to see, even if you hardly ever use the fucking form.<br />
<br />
And yet Blizzard have stated they are working on the other forms as well and they will be released in future patches.<br />
<br />
That &quot;fucking form&quot; you are talking about, are you implying one can change into a rabbit or somesuch later on?</div></div><hr />

The cow nose doesn't bother me and I like the ring in the nose too. This particular model, imo, is by far a better replacement than the new bear forms were.<br />

Don't hold your breath for it, there won't be. I could even live with the male lion form, after all it is a nice model in spite of not fitting a female druid. What I really dislike is the nose-ring though. <br />
<br />
I switch to cat form and... ok, I grow a mane, a tail, fangs... but how do you explain me suddenly &quot;growing&quot; a nose-ring? I know you might think this is a stupid complaint but I just don't like it. *shrug*<br />
<br />
Just my opinion.</div></div><hr />

This. While the rest of the form is really cool, the nose ring is just... please don't force my cat to use one of the least-used facial features of a Tauren.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, NE catform has always been the best looking form, hope they dont ruin it by giving it a giant head like the new tauren one. I'm guessing it will be more or less the same, just with new eyes and colours like the new NE bear form.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Um... Maybe because we're simply assuming the aspect of the bear and cat spirits. Maybe they are male? If you assume the form of a male spirit, why wouldn't you look more masculine or take on some male-traits of your species?<br />
<br />
Granted, the nose ring fits with the culture but does skew the appearance more towards male, unlike the bears. I was half-hoping they'd make the cat form more feminine than masculine to balance it out, but meh, I love the new forms anyway.</div></div><hr />

It's short-sighted to assume the latest armor only would be all they would &quot;fix.&quot; That's a lot more than a mere four or five pieces.<br />
<br />
In all likelyhood they'd have to do every piece from grey to legendary from level 1 to 80 to make them properly show up. Have none of them thought this through? Just because a druid is level 80 doesn't mean it'll be wearing tier pieces (something I've seen mentioned almost exclusively). Some people just can't get past their much desired fetish to show off armor and cry when it's not done. I bet if it was done they'd still QQ because it was not living up to an impossible expectation of how it should look.<br />
<br />
It's a work in progress. This game has a ton of work done on it, being done and still to be done. They aren't just going to release these skins and go, &quot;there, that's all you get&quot; and never work on them again. I wouldn't hold my breath for a fast turn around though.</div></div><hr />

Stick to the truth please. Official promise came end of last year not four years ago.</div></div><hr />

Is that better? I'm sure I can find a blue post backing it up if you're really, really desperate for absolute, irrefutable facts. And the most obvious skin that's temporary is travel form. It was meant to be something else and they just stuck a cheetah skin placeholder.<br />
<br />
Either way, Orc shoulders were broke a year, the promise to fix (what would quite obviously be implied broken from the start since they did not alter the base skins, ever) druid skins also came a year ago. So Druid skins would trump a newer problem anyways.</div></div><hr />

Actually, promises like these have been given several times during these years, though GC's first post on this topic, as with everything he is involved with, seemed a lot more substantial than the previous ones. Though realists/pessimists still highly doubted it would come that soon, given druids' previous experiences with promises.<br />
3.2 previews including the new forms are coming early, but one has to remember it will take at least two months if not more until it goes live.</div></div><hr />
