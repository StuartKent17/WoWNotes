Ok, core if issue inc. Value of crit PvP != Value of crit PvE. Value of other stats PvP = Val other stat PvE. Given that, how can you possible make balanced with other values in PVE and PvP at the same time? If you can't, crit classes will be weak in PvP. If you buff them, they'll be strong in PvE.<br />
It's worth remembering that at 200%, crit is *more* valuable in PvP, than PvE. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/443439880199077889))<br />
Will elemental shamans still get their buffed crit modifier in PvP?<br />
It's a 25% reduction to crit damage. So they still get extra crit damage, but then reduced by 25%. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/443464655910883328))<br />
So (200% base +50% extra) -25% = 187.5% crit for ele shamans in PvP?<br />
Yes (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/443466381971816448))<br />
<br />
Warlords of Draenor Stats<br />
'Afternoon. WoD Tank info seems hard to come by. 3 ?s, if you are willing: Value of Multistrike for tanks(just dps or more)?<br />
Multistrike will have defensive value. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/444179013720748032))<br />
Is that just self-heals, or a chance for damage reduction to multistrike? I.e., get another 30% of your armor?<br />
Just like there are passives that give defensive value to crit, there will be passives that give defensive value to Multistrike. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/444204525503520768))<br />
<br />
.Meaning 30% Multistrike = one 30% roll in PvP (max 130% damage), two 15% rolls in PvE (max 160% damage), same avg dmg?<br />
Yes. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/443564629050920960))<br />
<br />
Also, the same argument can be made for haste because haste bonus to CC casts. Separate value there too? <br />
Multistrike will also have a PvP modifier. One extra roll instead of two. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/443445206738665472))<br />
Everyone will just avoid crit and multistrike like the plague, don't see how it's a good idea<br />
Multistrike's combines the two rolls into one. Same average chance. Multistrike will definitely *not* be avoided. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/443471882973495296))<br />
are you sure that multistrike isn't causing a similar problem that you just fixed with 150% crits? Peaky dmg.<br />
Multistrike caps out at 130%, and is much *much* more common, such that it will be the common occurrence, not a rare burst. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/443692554106568704))<br />
<br />
PvE<br />
Pugging is a prob. a niche audience too though, saying that just because personal is an option, organizers might not take it<br />
I'd expect PUG organizers using personal loot will see more takers. It's nice to not worry whether you can trust the master loot (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/440628348796952576))<br />
<br />
any plans for an increase of tank dmg taken to make room for dedicated tank healers again?<br />
If we hit tanks any harder today, we'd just one-shot them. Vengeance and smart heals are the major culprits. Agree with the goal. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/440595499494547456))<br />
Just tank healing or Single-Target healing in general? I think targeted healing is more interesting than aoe/smart<br />
Absolutely. Making decisions is more interesting than pushing a button and having them made for you. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/440632932827275265))<br />
<br />
how are heroic lockouts handled? had a shammy, not able to join H.Galakras because he was locked to 3/4 /w H.Norushen down.<br />
Heroic lockouts assign a single fixed raid ID for the week, and you can't enter any other Heroic ID for that zone once locked. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/440671787609636865))<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
If silences are gone from interrupt, what happens to silencing shot? Gone too?<br />
Replaced with Counter Shot (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/443596569657356289))<br />
<br />
Is there a reason a lot of classes dodge/parry monks in arenas? 6% over pvp expertise cap, and I don't get issue on other toons <br />
Agility classes gain dodge &amp; strength classes gain parry. Attack them from behind to avoid getting dodged/parried. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/443811706934792192))<br />
<br />
Will Movement speed stack in RBG disapear totally anytime soo ? <br />
We're reimplementing this speed system in Warlords to avoid alot of these stacking bugs slipping through. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/443801591510863873))<br />

Warlords of Draenor<br />

I think it's been said on more than one occasion by Blizzard officials that there's always a chance that WoD might go live not featuring updated models for all races in the game. Those that don't make it into the game on shipping day will then be added later with one of the content patches.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think that at this point this won't be happening. Keep in mind that they were planning on updating the Draenei and Blood Elves last, so the fact that we're getting the new Draenei models unveiled so soon seems hopeful to me. I also think that regardless of how far along they are that they are planning to have all of the races (maybe even including Goblin and Worgen), including varied faces done for release. They've heard player complaints and they're addressing them. And this is probably why WoD is taking so long, which I'm a bit miffed at though so long as they create a decent product I can't complain. The good news is that if they are delaying the expansion for the new models, that gives them more development time for other features as well (as obviously only a subset of the dev team will be working on the models.). So they've got a lot of time to build something spectacular.</div></div><hr />

Well there were even WOTLK commercials made with the dance studio. So even if you see a commercial for an expansion you canÂ´t be sure everything will be there when you buy. False advertising some would call it.. Remember path of the titans? Scrapped completely.</div></div><hr />

But the Draenei are one of the main races of Draenor. I'm all up for Night Elves, but Draenei get the priority in this case. Especially if they wanted to start the BETA in order for the NPC's to be updated and all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can thank 90 booster toons for this one. Blizzard is dropping people into the game with the bare minimum to do ToT LFR, with no idea how to play the class they just auto-dinged, and saying &quot;go queue up&quot; before they even put their spells on the bars. Ask anyone and they'll tell you that Horridon has become just plain Horri-ble since the pre-purchases with the boost became available.<br />

<br />
This is exactly why Draenei are getting an update before nelfs. Seeing as how the major Alliance race is once again Draenei, they're gonna need to focus on them in order to release any further promotional materials. I'm sure nelfs are next to be worked on.</div></div><hr />

They constantly shift around on the races. He just gave you a list of what they are currently working on. They don't work on those models until they are finished and then move on down the list, it's an organic process, and whenever Robinson feels one of them looks ready to show, he shows it. He doesn't show them when they are 100% finished. And NOTHING IS DELAYED. They likely have started on every single race, the first race they said they were working on 6 months before MOP came out was dwarves, then a month before MOP, orcs and HUMANS. We then saw Forsaken, Tauren, Gnomes, orcs, and dwarves before any humans. Stop thinking with such rigid binary logic and stop being alarmist drama queens over your favorite race. <br />
<br />
They have been careful to always never make any guarantees, but they've significantly changed their tone and clearly feel the races will be ready for launch by what we've heard in the last few months by including both blood elves and draenei on the websiite, at worst worgen and goblins will be later to get the new bone rigging system and cloth stylized physics. A dev even said they would all be released for free in the preparation content patch before WOD's release in a blue quote last month. Go find it yourself.</div></div><hr />

A dev even said they would all be released for free in the preparation content patch before WOD's release in a blue quote last month. Go find it yourself.<br />
<br />
Problem is that People always over analyze stuff.<br />
Just because NE weren't mentioned doesn't mean they aren't being worked on.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Should be interesting to see none the less. Though i always thought the draenei models had more detail than the original races? Could be wrong there.</div></div><hr />

So even if you see a commercial for an expansion you canÂ´t be sure everything will be there when you buy. False advertising some would call it.. Remember path of the titans? Scrapped completely.<br />
<br />
No, not true. The dance studio WAS in the preview trailer for WotLK, but it did not appear in the commercials which came much later on.</div></div><hr />

Not for nothing, but those tweets were from March 10/11th. No idea why they're hitting the front page now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I mean, if you mean changed their direction from the direction they supposedly had 6 months ago, then yeah. Otherwise this is really consistent with the latest announcements they've made.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
This too, I mean, I'm as much of a NE fan as the other guy (a lot of my characters are NE after all) but I don't get the rage/extreme worry. It's in the works, no need to have a fit.</div></div><hr />
