<br />
IMO, some stuff just needs to be abandoned or put on life support. HoTS, Starcraft II and Diablo 3 are a good example of games that have outlived their usefulness. D3 and Starcraft II are simply games that reached their conclusion and HoTS is a niche dead end.<br />
<br />
They need good new blood in their games portfolio, not try and drag dying horse for another year or two before it inevitably fllps. <br />
<br />
They need new Diablo game, new Starcraft game and hell maybe new IP too. I am personally happy they want to push Diablo forward, hopefully new game announcement soon that is not played on phone.</div></div><hr />

They didn't meet your expectations, they did meet Blizzard's. <br />
<br />
D3 was free money for them. They put the bare minimum effort into that game and people still play it every single season.</div></div><hr />

That's not necessarily true. They closed the HotS e-sports division, the publishing rights to Destiny were sold back to Bungie - there are probably a lot of staff leftover from those teams that are no longer required.<br />
<br />
I don't like the direction that Blizzard is going, but these layoffs (if they end up happening to the departments mentioned) make perfect sense from a business point of view.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ungeir</div><div class="date">2019-02-12, 10:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This sucks badly for the individuals being laid off - but it's the right call. This is non-development staff - as a custuomer I'm happy that they're scaling down on the crazy amount of money being spent on e-sports initiatives, reducing the corporate bureaucracy and making sure the resources are spent on development.<br />
<br />
Blizzard has been having trouble getting games and content out of the door - they're not producing enough and the quality is often questionable. Many roles, especially in technical and engineering positions are becoming more difficult and expensive to fill. They need to find the money for this somewhere. That 8% layoff isn't being used to increase dividends. It's refocusing the organization for better production of games. Will this succeed? Maybe. It requires more than shifting around budget figures - it's important that the organization has a whole is trimmed. Getting rid of corporate cruft and office politics is extremely difficult. There's a huge risk they'll fail. But this restructuring can be part of succeeding.</div></div><hr />

It's just not the case - ActiBlizz effectively flatlined and 2019 outlook does not look good. There is no infinite growth here.</div></div><hr />

It's non-development staff. They just closed the e-sports division for HotS and gave the publishing rights for Destiny back to Bungie. There are staff that were in these roles which are no longer needed. This is a perfectly sound business decision.</div></div><hr />

This isn't a case of the companies involved going bankrupt. They're going mean and lean on non-dev costs, to put those savings into game dev costs, thus the 20% more resources. Sucks for the 800 people, absolutely, but you skipped right past the part where they made a record amount of PROFIT in 2018 and went right to &quot;THEY'RE GOING OUT OF BUSINESS!!!&quot;</div></div><hr />

This is non-development staff - as a custuomer I'm happy that they're scaling down on the crazy amount of money being spent on e-sports initiatives, reducing the corporate bureaucracy and making sure the resources are spent on development.<br />
<br />
Blizzard has been having trouble getting games and content out of the door - they're not producing enough and the quality is often questionable. Many roles, especially in technical and engineering positions are becoming more difficult and expensive to fill. They need to find the money for this somewhere. That 8% layoff isn't being used to increase dividends. It's refocusing the organization for better production of games. Will this succeed? Maybe. It requires more than shifting around budget figures - it's important that the organization has a whole is trimmed. Getting rid of corporate cruft and office politics is extremely difficult. There's a huge risk they'll fail. But this restructuring can be part of succeeding.<br />
<br />
as long as the philosophy behind is accurate and as long as the money goes into the right channels, i believe also that this will make sense.</div></div><hr />

They're increasing development resources for their core titles, and cutting back staff and costs in non-development sectors.<br />
<br />
At the very least it shows that they know where they need to focus growth.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
So what I get from this is: forget about BFA and Blizz 2019 in general and wait for the next expansion/games in probably 2020/21 when they got their shit sorted out after 'transition year'.<br />
<br />
8.2 and Classic are launching this summer, which should bring a solid rebound to Blizzard's numbers by the end of the year. Sekiro is also launching next month, which I expect will be a &quot;surprise success&quot; for Activision.<br />
<br />

I'm secretly hoping that they start to consider releasing more primarily singleplayer titles in the future. A world where Blizzard could start publishing semi-annual AAA titles in the Warcraft, Starcraft, Diablo, Overwatch universes? Yes please. It works for other AAA developers.</div></div><hr />

yep. ecatly the same has surprised me. it seems nearly they once in life listened to players and there is a small chance, that they really want focus more and better to their core values and invest into them, instead just milking them until they dry out. all in all i am surprised to read this direction, bc imo it is the right direction.</div></div><hr />

I'd love to see corporate America take that stance, as a whole, but it's one of the ugliest aspects of that part of the business world, that I wouldn't even begin to try and defend. If Blizzard or any corporation said they were deferring corporate bonuses and using that money to pay their employees more, I'd be a solid customer of theirs, but it's so rare now it's almost unicorn rare. <br />

ATVI are no better and no worse than any other companies out there in this regard, and I've worked for many companies who have the same extreme wage disparity between executives and workers, and watched it grow worse every year. I don't know how to fix it, I wish I did.</div></div><hr />

Hate to break it to you, but that's the point of a company. Especially a publically traded company.<br />
<br />
It's not good enough for a company to be profitable and to continue being profitable, they have to keep increasing the profit margin every quarter.<br />
<br />
Even if they're doing record numbers overall, their profits aren't breaking records, so it was considered a bad quarter. The layoffs are also moreso in anticipation of a lean 2019 than they are a response to a poor 2018.</div></div><hr />

Just gonna point something out here: Blizzard didn't make the decision to make these layoffs did. ATVI did. In this one instance where Bobby Kotick and ATVI are clearly in the wrong for this decision, you're all...blaming Blizzard?<br />
<br />
Having been through layoffs in my own career, I can tell you one thing - they GUT the people who have to decide who to cut, when orders come down from up high. I guarantee you there are people at Blizzard right now who feel like they're utter shit because they have to fire people.</div></div><hr />

NO-ONE. FUCKING. CARES.<br />
<br />
no one cares what a company is supposed to do, no one cares what the investors want, no one fucking gives a shit about the profits.<br />
<br />
they want a game, preferably a good one, and if acti/bliz is out of the business of making them then they're quickly going to go out of business altogether.<br />
because at the end of the day, it's not their choice that determines the profits, it's the customer's.<br />
both Ea and acti should of learned that lesson this year, guess they'll only learn it when it's pounding into their head at the unemployment line or better yet, the court room.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Makes record profit. Leaders gets huge bonuses and salary. Starts firing people. Keep the work on creating shitty ass games with some kind of cashshop.<br />
<br />
Oh Blizzard, I feel sorry for you. Your passion for games, creating your awesome universes with great gameplay and story and share them with us. All you once wanted was to share just that.<br />
<br />
Now its more about the dollar dollar bill.<br />
<br />
I think it's more that Acti-Blizz has been handing down proclamations from on high to Blizzard Entertainment, the people who actually make the games. Very sad.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's not good enough for a company to be profitable and to continue being profitable, they have to keep increasing the profit margin every quarter.<br />
<br />
Even if they're doing record numbers overall, their profits aren't breaking records, so it was considered a bad quarter. The layoffs are also moreso in anticipation of a lean 2019 than they are a response to a poor 2018.<br />
<br />
You;re talking as if magically I don't know how companies work. The whole point is to make profits, this i am well aware of.<br />
<br />
However, the point is perception. They are right now just showing themselves to be a money whoring company, which is lending credence to the &quot;They aren't what they were...&quot; arguments.<br />
This in turn could cause a downshift in people buying their products. After all, if they don't even give a damn about their staff, why would they give a damn about their product range if they can just churn it out for a quick buck? Thus, their profit margin might deteriorate even further.<br />
it is nothing to do with keeping on staff that aren't needed, there is always optimisation. But this stuff has come at a time when they literally cannot afford the perception in the public eye, especially amongst their die-hard community starting to think &quot;Wtf?&quot;. <br />
Look at the Diablo mobile nonsense and how badly they misjudged that. <br />
<br />
As I said, it is them just trying to milk a franchise now, in order to maximise shareholder return, which is of course the point of the company, but in terms of perception, this move might do them more harm than good long term.<br />
<br />
Honestly? At this point, I kind of hope they go under.</div></div><hr />

I said I *hope*, not that they will.<br />

Seriously, try and read before making assumptions. As I said, this is all based on public perception, and their sales *are* slowing. They only have a handful of products, and they are all slowing down, and being milked within an inch of their life.<br />
They need to introduce something new, and make some amendments to their product range to renew investor confidence for the year to come, otherwise this forthcoming lean year might stretch into a lean decade, and their profit margins will slip drastically.<br />
Perception is everything in business, and the public and shareholder perception for Acti-Blizz right now cannot be good.</div></div><hr />

BS Activision and Blizzard are the same entity. Blizzard leadership is as much responsible as Activision’s because basically they are the same. There needs to be a point where we all accept tha Blizzard is not a stand alone company as it hasn’t been for 10 years.

Blizzard is still Blizzard. There is no &quot;old Blizzard&quot; vs &quot;new Blizzard.&quot; - Blizzard has been doing the same things and getting criticized for them since the 90s at least. Blame Blizzard. Don't give Blizzard a free pass by blaming Activision. <br />

It's the old scorpion and the frog story. Corporations will always act in their own best interest, and ATVI exists for one reason - to soak up profits from it's subsidiaries. ATVI makes nothing, sells nothing, all they do is own companies, to funnel the profits to it's investors, and the officers of ATVI. <br />
<br />
So, why expect them to do anything that isn't in their very nature? It's been about the money from day one. Always was. They wouldn't have formed ATVI if there wasn't money involved. And, a LOT of money. <br />
<br />
Blizzard seems to have been able to go their own way, as long as they sent fat checks up the pipe to ATVI. Well, the checks are a lot smaller, so...ATVI is doing what it was formed to do. Dance with the devil, and all that.<br />
<br />
Not defending it, but it's how it is. It can work to everyone's advantage - good games, tons of profits, lots of jobs, or it doesn't.<br />
<br />
And, from a business perspective, these moves are trying to get back to that point. Granted - they could get the same results by not paying out 15 million dollar signing bonuses, but that's a whole 'nother issue that's not unique to ATVI and it's subsidiaries.</div></div><hr />

<br />
hmm, i am not really sure about that. <br />
<br />
first: i am not sure if they mean things more along the lines that the overall place in market hasnt met expectations. example here: HotS. Designed as the next big moba game, but years too late and not able to drive ppl away from Dota and LoL. maybe they do not mean shortterm stuff like an xpac was successful or not. maybe more the grand sheme of things and what played out well and what not.<br />
<br />
second: i would be not that sure, profit wise, that BfA is not a success. all you see is tiny minority of wow players forming the BfA sucks picture. but do not confuse this with the reality. we have no data. and 78% of all player never set a foot in the official forums. you hear and see nothing from them. besides that, BfA has a high amount of good working cash grab systems, like token, Allied Races, services, etc. and maybe the profit, even with a million lost subs, is even higher via this systems. with no data i would especially in this case be very very careful.</div></div><hr />

They are not the same entity, and I'm not going to get bogged down into that dumb argument again. Go learn what holding companies are, and subsidiaries. <br />
<br />
You are right, that if Blizzard had done better, this wouldn't be happening, but it's not all directly because of Blizzard. Activision's blunders are just as much to blame, especially the Destiny issue. These layoffs are hitting several companies. Blizzard did not decide to lay off people at Activision Publishing. ATVI did.<br />
<br />
Both companies, Activision Publishing, and Blizzard, screwed up. They're losing marketshare, facing extreme competition for what games they have (Apex), and have no games slated for release in 2019. Either Kotick allowed them to get that bogged down...or he's not as much of an influence on his subsidiaries as everyone thinks he is. Pick one. I'm going with the latter - and he's moving to get his companies back on track, because HIS job is to keep the shareholders happy, regardless of how you or anyone else feels about it. This is business, get a helmet.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No. Just stop. It's didn't &quot;mutate&quot; at all. <br />
<br />
Activison Blizzard is a holding company that owns Activision Publishing, which is the game developer. <br />
<br />
Activision Blizzard, or ATVI, who Bobby Kotick runs now, just has &quot;Activision&quot; in the name. That's all. <br />
<br />
Activision Publishing is a company ATVI owns. Kotick used to run it, he stepped down when ATVI was formed. They have a new CEO now, that they hired recently from within the company.<br />

Activision Publishing • Blizzard Entertainment • King Publishing • eSports • Blizzard Television<br />

I have worked in IT for many years and have considered relocating to work for Blizz in the past. But I didn't post to openings there that I was qualified for and took a different path. Today is one of those days where it appears that was the correct choice, because my position would likely have been more in infra/arch than dev, and it sounds like those were the positions that got hit the hardest. <br />
<br />
And it should also be a lesson for CEO's underestimating the long-term effects an 8% workforce cut (which was much higher than the 3-5% people were whispering) will have. The quality of talent that will apply to Blizz in the future just went down a couple notches, and there will be plenty of people above and beyond the 8% that were cut that will start looking around at other employers if they haven't already. That's the problem though is that less tangible numbers like that don't show up on CEO spreadsheets. If I'm a qualified person in Southern Cal lf a job I don't think I'd go near Blizz for at least 3-4 years, and even then it's only if some signs of the old Blizz start to come back.

<br />
NO-ONE. FUCKING. CARES.<br />
<br />
no one cares what a company is supposed to do, no one cares what the investors want, no one fucking gives a shit about the profits.<br />
<br />
they want a game, preferably a good one, and if acti/bliz is out of the business of making them then they're quickly going to go out of business altogether.<br />
because at the end of the day, it's not their choice that determines the profits, it's the customer's.<br />
both Ea and acti should of learned that lesson this year, guess they'll only learn it when it's pounding into their head at the unemployment line or better yet, the court room.<br />
<br />
AMEN. I can't stand people that defend the company that constantly takes dumps on their customers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As we start to hear more names it's looking like the brush was pretty wide in all areas including devs and people that support devs. <br />
<br />
Not to mention if you're super-talented, maybe the next Chris Metzen, are you looking at Blizzard as a good place to apply anytime soon? Think these cuts won't affect the morale of the people that weren't let go to see plenty of empty desks? Think the people that weren't cut aren't re-evaluating their own careers today as to whether they should jump ship before it sinks? <br />
<br />
Those will all have real effects on games. Maybe the people that stay will overcome them and new games and content will be great. But it's way oversimplifying it to think something this major won't have any effect. Anyone who's worked in a corporate office and lived through days like this knows that very well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Seems like it; they never devoted the proper resources to it post original launch and wondered why it fizzled out. The story needed a lot of shoring up. Hearthstone will follow suit since they can't figure out that their content pacing and pricing is what is sinking it; adding 20% more resources to it is putting out a fire with gasoline. It's not Candy Crush, as much as they'd like all of their games to be. The whole call left me feeling like I need a shower.</div></div><hr />

My thoughts also.<br />
<br />
People can prattle on all they like about &quot;but long term growth, and lean years!&quot; all they like. Perception is everything, and with only a handful of games actually in their portfolio seemingly performing, a perceived focus on profit &gt; quality by the public, and layoffs like this? What developer or coder will want to work on a game that might not even see the light of day, and has a high risk of redundancy at this time?<br />
<br />
It is going to be a tough time for Blizzard in the near future, profit margins be damned.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gioderpington</div><div class="date">2019-02-13, 12:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">IMO, some stuff just needs to be abandoned or put on life support. HoTS, Starcraft II and Diablo 3 are a good example of games that have outlived their usefulness. D3 and Starcraft II are simply games that reached their conclusion and HoTS is a niche dead end.<br />
<br />
They need good new blood in their games portfolio, not try and drag dying horse for another year or two before it inevitably fllps. <br />
<br />
They need new Diablo game, new Starcraft game and hell maybe new IP too. I am personally happy they want to push Diablo forward, hopefully new game announcement soon that is not played on phone.<br />
<br />
I can't speak for HoTs and Diablo but SC2 has seen increases in esports and had 1.8 million active players as of end of 2018. I think people confuse campaign updates with how popular a game is. SC2 is fantastic space opera, but it's a pvp game in the end.<br />
<br />
After reading through more comments I have no idea where people are getting this idea that SC is dead. I can only assume that because people claim it's dead because they simply don't play it anymore. Its not as huge as overwatch or WoW, but it is lost definitely not dead. At worse I might say it's in extreme balance mode because what do you add to a game like SC2? You can't just add units or a race without having to rebalance everything. (Then still added coop!)<br />
Yes, the game probably lost 60% of it's players 3 years after release. But that's what happens? It was new and shiny and attracted people but people get bored. Kinda like how it happening now to overwatch, hearthstone, and heros of the storm.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For some reason, my brain is thinking &quot;Quest packs&quot; you can purchase form the store to unlock *more* content from the expansion you just bought.<br />
<br />
And Allied Races you can purchase, along with new skins/cosmetic items etc.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I am not personally convinced it will mean better quality production (that has always been high), I just suspect more ways to milk the franchise :D</div></div><hr />

So they're not doing poorly, but they want to pretend they are to justify cutting nearly 10% of their workforce and making cuts to their titles? The directions they're taking are showing in the quality of their content, if they want to perform better, providing better content and service seems like the no-brainer.<br />

<br />
first: i am not sure if they mean things more along the lines that the overall place in market hasnt met expectations. example here: HotS. Designed as the next big moba game, but years too late and not able to drive ppl away from Dota and LoL. maybe they do not mean shortterm stuff like an xpac was successful or not. maybe more the grand sheme of things and what played out well and what not.<br />
<br />
second: i would be not that sure, profit wise, that BfA is not a success. all you see is tiny minority of wow players forming the BfA sucks picture. but do not confuse this with the reality. we have no data. and 78% of all player never set a foot in the official forums. you hear and see nothing from them. besides that, BfA has a high amount of good working cash grab systems, like token, Allied Races, services, etc. and maybe the profit, even with a million lost subs, is even higher via this systems. with no data i would especially in this case be very very careful.<br />
<br />
I guess. Hopefully they gonna go harder with wow again, trying to regain some lost players</div></div><hr />

On the same call they were bragging about making more money than ever before, they fired 1,000 people, because they think they should have made even more.<br />

Will be interesting, the guy who was in charge of COD was just promoted to CEO of Activision Publishing. COD needs new leadership. It's one of their few titles with any potential left. <br />

Honestly, Activision is in way worse shape than Blizzard. Blizzard is holding on, but Activision needs some new games, and they need to get their studios producing. They own way too many dev studios to be in the shape they are.</div></div><hr />

Who knows but it’s pretty evident they’re actually focusing more on WoW, so this could potentially be very good news for the game. It’s a bunch of word salad though so we’ll see what actually happens eventually.<br />

However I’m pretty upset that Ythisens is gone. I really liked his communication and clear passion for the game. He was in class discord’s very frequently. I’ve seen him in the Paladin discord a ton. Can’t really say that for any other CM I’ve seen. He’s always up for a good discussion about classes and what makes them fun. He’s been in multiple threads discussing exactly that along with current game design, systems, etc. Will definitely miss seeing someone whose extremely passionate about WoW posting on the forums almost every day.

I don't think they need a new Diablo game. I would much rather have a second Diablo expansion than a whole new game. A new expansion is an opportunity to start fresh. They can adjust systems that players aren't enjoying and create new ones that players have been asking for. Also, a new class goes a long way.</div></div><hr />

He was a terrible CM that posted meme responses to everything and tried to marginalize any legitimate criticism on the forums. <br />

You know he meant pre Activision. When they were under Vivendi things were different. There’s been many many employees who stated how Vivendi never pressured them on anything. Activision however remains a force hovering above. Especially after 2013 when Vivendi sold their majority shares to Activision and no longer had the power. <br />
<br />
It doesn’t even matter though now. The Blizzard of today isn’t the Blizzard of old any longer. A split from Activision wouldn’t matter now. <br />
<br />
I do wonder how things would look today if some of Vivendi had managed to get Kotick fired like they wanted to in 2013.

This isn't a move to make the company money, these people were negligible overhead if they have the finances to pay a handful of people more than that. This is an investor virtue signal, a &quot;look, we're doing something!&quot; if you will.<br />
<br />
No new IP development, doubling down on the mobile shit that investors didn't buy and consumers didn't buy, nothing has changed, and this layoff isn't an indication that something has changed. They aren't massively ramping up development, they're not committing to aggressively growing IP and developing games, they're basically saying &quot;we're going to try to chase the existing sources of revenue we have.&quot;<br />
<br />
This should be the biggest red flag imaginable for investors. If Activision/Blizzard was a 1/10 investment opportunity before, it's a 0/10 now.</div></div><hr />

Their current streak of reinventing the wheel isn't too hot.<br />
<br />
Then we as a playerbase have to help them when they do better, meaning, if 8.2 is actually good (for now it seems that way but we will see), instead of disliking because blizzard uploaded a new survival video, we should pump it up and at least return for one month so investors see that the development team from wow is still worth it.<br />
<br />
It's good to bash wow when they screw it, but we also should be mature and praise it when they have managed enough to be praised, if not, we would be helping to kill wow.<br />

But thats not how it is. Activision does not own Blizzard, they are a joint venture so it's really Blizzard &quot;hovering over&quot; Blizzard. Besides, I don't think thats what he meant at all.<br />

<br />
They’re not exactly joint. There’s still a boss and that’s Kotick right now. Did you notice that when Morhaime left, his replacement didn’t get promoted to the same level he was? That puts Blizzard even lower on the totem pole. Kotick led a group that purchased over 600 million shares from Vivendi in 2013, 5 years after the “merge”. That put Vivendi no longer with a majority share, and thus no power any longer. It’s exactly why Kotick threatened to quit unless he was backed for this purchase. As for linking previous comments about Vivendi, I can’t. This is all from memory over watching the various docuvideos and making ofs where Blizzard talked about Vivendi being so great to work with. Although if you have the WoW diary book, John Staat comments about them too.<br />
<br />
And this is all with me not giving any thought to the various things said recently by long time ex employees like Brevik who has stated how god awful Activision Blizzard has been towards the Blizzard employees.</div></div><hr />

Vivendi was seeking a special dividend of about two to three billion dollars to pay down its own debts, all of that to come out of Activision and Blizzard. So do the math. Vivendi raids Activision/Blizzard of cash reserves and what do you imagine happens to Blizzard? At the time Kotick was seen as saving both companies. Vivendi had plans after getting all of Activision/Blizzard's cash (and leaving them in debt) to simply sell them off to someone else. <br />

Well that means no resourcing impact on WoW, and the fact they are putting their focus back into internally owned (rather than franchised) IP is all good news for WoW.<br />
<br />
No... it means the same old tires, unimaginative, and stubborn development team will continue to destroy the franchise of WoW. I'm waiting for &quot;the other shoe to drop&quot;... hopefully they get smart and can the current dev ledership (Ion and friends) and replace them with some quality developers who still have passion for WoW.<br />

You seem to get the impression that simply because I think that capitalism has faults, that I am a communist lol. I thoroughly understand how &quot;capitalism&quot; works and how businesses aim to maximise profits, BUT when a company posts its highest EVER revenues and STILL lays off 8% of its workforce compulsorily, then to me then that is morally wrong. There is nothing wrong with wanting to reduce your workforce to reduce costs, but to me it should have been in this case on a voluntary basis with relocation if possible.<br />
<br />
To me this is also a indictment of US labour laws too, as in the EU, with all its faults, it is harder to hire and fire people with more than two years service.</div></div><hr />
