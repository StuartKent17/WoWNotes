I didn't like Wildstar. Does this mean one of us is wrong? I don't think so. I dislike seeing comments like this because it has nothing to do with the information provided in the news. Perhaps if you said something about what you like and dislike about content in the news.<br />

Also, what's up with the crappy looking character art on the loading screens? Are those fan made? Sylvanas and Varian look comically bad. Did they fire the artist who normally drew them and replace him/her with an intern?</div></div><hr />

Playable arakkoa now has all of my want. With a racial mount mechanic similar to worgen, but for flight. Never going to happen.<br />

EK one is especially weird, just simply outside the warcraft videogame franchise (most anime-ish artwork is for the comics and/or fan-made).<br />
<br />
Kalimdor one is slightly better, but Thrall does indeed look a bit weird, and Gallywix... well if that's the &quot;lore-appropriate&quot; version, I'd rather have him keep looking like a regular goblin than a disney villain -_-<br />
<br />
<br />
Really like the Arakkoa models... armor sets mostly weak/not very original IMO so far. (Khadgar &amp; Durotan have the best armor sets &quot;released&quot; so far xD)</div></div><hr />

I had 15 minutes to check out the new build in the early morning before work.<br />
The new draenei female is lovely. Gotta love her face during /cower :D LOTS of garrison and follower UI fixes have been done.<br />
Lvl100 talents are now enabled. I quickly tested Glad Stance, it's cool. SS crits 11K+ at 92 with green gear. I'm not quite sure but I remember 5-8K SS crits with standard prot. Considerable difference.<br />
Can't wait to test Gorgrond.</div></div><hr />

I also can't tell which one is male and which is female. I guess they look so odd because we are so used to seeing only males and all of them are crazy little hunchbacks.

Yes that is Lore appropriate. Look in Ashara, he has his face carved into a mountain (and apparently that is &quot;slightly&quot; prettied up). Yea, Looks like most of these were pulled from fan art, blizzard approved fan art (like Geblin, once fan art, now accepted appearance of him) or adds (Baine and Vol'jin remind me of various WoW patch / expansion headers.) Though they all could be fan art.<br />
If they switch Sylv out for a... less stylized one, It would look a hell of a lot better.<br />
<br />
<br />
I also can't tell which one is male and which is female <br />
I am going by the chest bindings. If it's binded it's a chick, not it's male.</div></div><hr />

I'm starting to warm up to them actually. They look alot cooler in the video when seeing all their animations rather than just the still picture. Still can't tell if these are all pictures of the female model or not. They probably are. now i'm curious if the male model will have any distinct differences in skeleton/animations like all other sentient Azeroth races do.</div></div><hr />

<br />
All of these images are from the short stories that Blizzard wrote some months back IIRC. That is actually Gallywix. Him being a typical goblin model is incorrect, he's actually meant to be very obese. Hence why most signso f him in-game he's in a mech. He's lazy and fat.</div></div><hr />

Gallywix is more accurately represented in this one picture than he is with his in-game model. I wish they'd give him his own model...seriously, every racial leader should have their own unique model.</div></div><hr />

Look in Ashara, he has his face carved into a mountain (and apparently that is &quot;slightly&quot; prettied up). Yea, Looks like most of these were pulled from fan art, blizzard approved fan art (like Geblin, once fan art, now accepted appearance of him) or adds (Baine and Vol'jin remind me of various WoW patch / expansion headers.) Though they all could be fan art.<br />
If they switch Sylv out for a... less stylized one, It would look a hell of a lot better.<br />
<br />
<br />
I am going by the chest bindings. If it's binded it's a chick, not it's male.<br />
<br />
and hips. She's slender than the male. They are both similar but still masculine and feminine enough. I like them. (and yes it's fantasy bird with boobs. ho and just to make you feel icky :) : think about if a fantasy bird would have a cloaca, HAHAHHAHAHA)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Gallywix is LORE-faithful. It's &quot;in game model&quot; is just a lazy-standard goblin when he should be a corrupt fat bastard. He was drawn like that since years now and it would make him an interesting and different character model for the game.<br />
<br />
That drawing of him is old and does not fit with the tone of the pic.<br />
<br />
The problem is characters does not belong to the pic : they don't look to each other or even the same thing.<br />
<br />
-<br />
Micro-head Varyan is just ridiculous. I know people loves HUGELY_MASSIVE_BIG_PLANETOID muscle on BIG_BIG_MASCULINE_STEROID_MALE+MALE characters, but that poor Varyan would have a lot of pain in life. so sad.<br />
<br />
Thrall is green crazy muscular jesus, but still I can imagine him being functional (I think he can put shoes himself), so it's possible.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree Thralls hair looks odd, though he could concievably be going bald, I know there are older orcs with hair, but Thralls hair has always had a receeding hairline. <br />
<br />
Also, I can't be the only one that thinks Gallywix looks like Cathy Burke in the loading screen can I? Furthermore, Varian and Sylvannas look dodgy as all hell, Varian looks like his face has been painted onto a rock; it's so devoid of detail and depth and Sylvannas looks waaaaay too sexy, look how perky and big her boobs are, and her face is more lips than face, she's supposed to be undead! <br />
<br />
The Draenor loading screen looks pretty awesome, not only because it's a good picture, but because the characters have a consistant art style. They don't need to have 1 artist do /all/ of the art for the loading screens, but they should all the characters on one loading screen done by the same artist so it looks consistant.<br />
<br />
I do like the new Arakoa models, though it is a bit of a shame they don't look like the Skeksies anymore. Kind of anyway....cos the Skeksies creep me the fuck out. <br />
<br />
<br />
Meh. Wildstar is still better.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Redlokyldoreifanggore</div><div class="date">2014-07-18, 09:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Several things:<br />
<br />
teehee Thrall no balls<br />
<br />
Secondly, loading screens. The art works seem drastically different. Sylvanas and Wrynn look a lot different (and worse) compared to Thrall, Vol'Jin, and Baine. Vol'Jin, Baine, and Thrall look pretty good compared to Velen and Tyrande who look rather haphazardly photoshopped in an attempt to match the style. The nice artwork within most of the Kalimdor leaders is way too contrast to the comic book stylizing of Eastern Kingdoms. Just as well, the artistry of the comic books doesn't really mesh well with the usual loading screen art. Additionally, I think it would be better if Greymane was shown in Worgen form. Gallywix looks great, now they just need to do that for his in-game model.<br />
<br />
Thirdly, the Arakkoa look good, though their polygons seem to be... less than what WoD is featuring. But overall very good. I especially like the gold chains they have connecting their beaks to their ears. Gives off a very exotic feel for the race.<br />
<br />
Fourthly, the mage and monk season armors look good. The mage is very basic and not very... flashy, which is something that has begun to plague a lot of armors for this game. It is certainly similar in a lot of aspects to the early MoP season mage armor, but it's still a different armor, simpler and more polished. <br />
<br />
Fifthly, there's still a lack of highly noticeable femgoat facial features. Notice how I said still? When you take away eye color, it reduces a lot of personality that a face can have, and with the femgoats it's fairly obvious even with their current in-game models. They severely need stronger defining features than changes of lipstick and arching of eyebrows. They need wrinkles, dimples, gems, additional spikes, more vibrant lip colors, just something that makes the faces more pronounced and unique.<br />
<br />
Forsaken chicks look fine, though there still seems to be a lack of the &quot;skull face&quot; that I rather liked when I still played one. Nevertheless they look very pretty, scary, and cool.<br />
<br />
As for all the other tedious number and item stuff, I'll let people with more of an attention span and stronger opinion have a whack at those.</div></div><hr />

Why is Velen on that new Kalimdor loading screen? They should replace him with Y'rel or Maraad since he dies at the beginning of the expansion.<br />
<br />
*SPOILERS*<br />
<br />
Otherwise, cool loading screens, i can see a couple of those as my background, the art department is outdoing themselves!</div></div><hr />

<br />
The old one has this cool vulture, hunchback posture, and birdlike twitchyness. With strong influences of Skeksis (Dark Crystal anyone?). This is just straight upright humanoid with bird features<br />
<br />
100% agree. Looks like a worgen mated with a harpy.</div></div><hr />

What the heck is Velen to you?<br />
<br />
Please tell me where Velen is on the loading screen with the picture of all the Warlords? That's the one I'm referring to, you know the screen that loads when you enter Draenor?<br />
<br />
<br />
Was to be expected.The loading screen of the new continent usually features the &quot;bad guys&quot;.<br />
<br />
TBC: Illidan/Kael<br />
Wrath: Arthas<br />
MoP: Mogu<br />
<br />
Anyway: it's easy to implement custom loading screens.<br />
<br />
You're right of course, it was to be expected. I guess I'm just a little tired of Orcs and want to see the Draenei showcased more. Perhaps I'm just being jaded or something because there are so many other cool races that could use some love and we have more Orcs instead.</div></div><hr />

Your opinion on the armor is subjective. Mythic tier is here to bring back the idea of amazing rewards for those that really work for it. That feel from back in vanilla where if you saw someone wearing even one purple or riding an epic mount, they were a sight to behold and justly so. It's alot better than everyone having the same purples just because lazy people don't wanna work hard enough to get armor that looks awesome. It also leaves something to be desired for people who don't like the look of regular tier, so if they want a better aesthetic then they have to work hard for it.</div></div><hr />

Same reason other creatures based on real world things take liberties.<br />

Also, the models seem to have been made somewhat androgynous so that a simple <br />

<br />
Female draenei are god awful. Broaden their nose. That nasty nasally tiny pinhead nose makes me feel like they'd be annoying. High pitched, nails on chalkboard voice. They are not elves. They are not dainty. Just because they were given the short stick in BC and given recycled blood elf faces doesn't mean it has to stay that way. God they're hideous. Even blood elves shouldn't be that ugly. Also I couldn't even tell what was changing in the first &quot;comparison&quot; it looked like the exact same screenshot over and over again. They need a LOT of work. As it is, they're going on the list of races I do not play &gt;.&lt;<br />
