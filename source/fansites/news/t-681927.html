World of Warcraft: Death Knight Manga<br />
Countless players have aided Thassarian in World of Warcraft as he battles against the Lich King's agents in Northrend, but few know the details of his former life. But that's about to change, as TOKYOPOP's newest self-contained manga, Death Knight, is in stores now, and it tells Thassarian's story -- a tale that reveals the origins, motivations, and darkest secrets of this tragic class.<br />

Health Pools in Cataclysm<br />
Health pools will be much larger in Cataclysm and healing will be lower. That should help address some of the overly binary feel of PvP and PvE encounters.<br />
<br />
You'll still be able to kill people as well as be able to heal them. The pace will just be a little slower and both healing and killing should require more than 1-2 buttons. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/21586498619-i-hope-blizzard-gets-pvep-right-in-cataclysm.html))<br />
<br />
Tanking and Healing in Cataclysm<br />
You missed the part where I said health pools will be higher. Imagine a boss that takes say 3-4 hits to kill a tank, but it also takes a healer 3-4 heals to top her back off. Now efficiency of a healing spell can be as much of a consideration as direct throughput, since the tank is unlikely to die in your next GCD. Now coordination among healers can be a bigger deal since efficiency will matter. Now maximum health on the tank classes will matter less because the question of how long you can survive without a heal landing is largely academic. Now avoidance on a tank can matter a little more because saving healer mana becomes as important as being table to take the next hit.<br />
<br />
As an aside, healers will actually need enough healing tools and enough distinction among them so that they are really choosing the big, expensive heal vs. the small, cheap heal vs. the fast, expensive heal, to name just a few examples. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/21586498619-i-hope-blizzard-gets-pvep-right-in-cataclysm.html))<br />
<br />
Classes balance in Cataclysm and burst damage<br />
The gear scaling is &quot;easy&quot; to fix, meaning we know what to do and it just requires a lot of work. We are prepared for players to be sad when their ratings convert less favorably, but most would agree it's good for the game in the long run.<br />
<br />
I already addressed the burst issue above. If the bathtub is bigger, then the rate of health pouring in and going down the drain don't affect the volume as severely.<br />
<br />
There is going to be a big focus on BGs for Cataclysm, including the ability to get the best PvP gear from rated BGs. (All of this was announced at Blizzcon -- I'm not saying anything new here.)<br />
<br />
I also don't want to give the impression class balance is perfect. It's not. We have some success stories and some specs that we didn't get to where we intended. But we had an ambitious design from the beginning, and the way we work means there is always a much larger list of stuff we want to get done than we can actually fit into a given expansion or patch. We think the trend is good, and a lot of the changes we made for Lich King are going to endure through Cataclysm, which means we'll be able to focus more on the problems we have now rather than resetting everything.

Battle.Net Improved Communication<br />
Putting the infrastructure in place was an important first step to implementing all of the features we intend to add. You may not see a big change on the front end of things, but on the back end it was a fairly big undertaking. A foundation is key to building anything of considerable complexity. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/21585909096-battlenet-improved-communication.html))<br />
<br />
Reasons behind the cost of Paid Race Change/Faction Change/Server Transfer/Name Change<br />
These features simply aren't included with your subscription fees. The monthly subscription rate didn't increase once these options were added. None of the paid services are necessary to play the game as advertised. Your subscription fees help us to maintain customer support, developing new content for each patch cycle, connect to and maintain our realms, allow us to store your account/character data, etc. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/21586089012-so-where-did-our-15-went.html))<br />

<br />
Effective Health and Tanking<br />
Too many of you are using EH (which is a very powerful concept for purposes of trying to decide how to gear your tank) as the number that indicates tank awesomeness. The higher the EH, the better tank I must be. It's just not that simple.<br />
<br />
I have yet to see any data that suggests warriors wipe relatively more than other tanks. What so many of these posts say are:<br />
<br />
1) I wipe a lot. It must be my class.<br />
2) Because my EH is lower, I am guessing that I wipe more often.<br />
3) I'm not sure if I wipe more often or not, but please just give me a buff so I feel better.<br />
<br />
The only argument I have seen so far that seems at all reasonable is that stamina scaling or other factors might eventually lead to warriors (and DKs) having a problem, and that &quot;eventually&quot; could happen in Icecrown. Unfortunately that's impossible to prove or disprove at this stage since it's all speculation. It's definitely something to keep an eye on though.<br />
<br />
(P.S. To be fair though, there are plenty of druids worried that scaling will end up hurting them because there is so much bonus armor on plate. They just tend to get drowned out in this particular forum.) (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/21560336259-who-else-is-tired-of-the--warrior-mt-line.html))<br />
<br />
Game balancing and top guilds<br />
We don't balance solely around the top 5% (in PvP or PvE). I've explained before why I think it would be a mistake to do so.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, the very best guilds are good barometers. They will stick with tradition as long as they can, but they will switch completely to a different strategy / class / tradeskill / whatever if they think it is required for the content.<br />
<br />
The reason I bring up good guilds a lot really is this: these guilds are often phenomenally better than the average guild. They aren't 5% better. They are hundreds of percentage points better. Therefore, obsessing over a 5% buff for your class won't affect your success rate nearly as much as improving your game. I'm not terribly sympathetic to arguments that you can't improve your group's performance at all, and if that's really the case (which I find unlikely), why are you worried about hard modes anyway? The normal modes of raids are designed to be completed by most groups with any interest in raiding. Most of these players would barely detect a 5% buff or nerf to stamina. They will get far more out of making sure Demo Shout or Curse of Elements are up 100% of the time or even swapping their gems.

Balance in Arenas<br />
I'm going to talk mostly about Arenas here, because I think that's where most of you are coming from. BG balance is a surprisingly different beast, and the one on one &quot;ganked in Stranglethorn&quot; or duel situation is just a lot less important.<br />
<br />
The way I approach Balance balance (rimshot) in Arena is in terms of comps. If I'm putting together a 3-player team, why do I want the Balance druid? You can joke about how you're a free kill or whatever, but I honestly don't really think that's the issue. Druids have CC and survival tools and a great debuff and I don't think it's just as simple as buffing those (unless they were silly OP like Stunfall was).<br />
<br />
I think the issue is comps. What does a Balance druid bring to the table? Why have one instead of just getting e.g. a mage, hunter or shaman? Yeah the obvious answer is to give everyone some form of Mortal Strike. We don't think that's the only answer though. Even if you assume MS is mandatory, there are enough classes that have it now that you should be able to bring MS and a healer and have room for a Boomkin as your third. That won't mean within the matrix of classes that every possible class combo makes sense, but it should mean that there are some comps that make sense.<br />
<br />
So what do Balance druids need before they look super attractive for a 3-player team? One answer is that they aren't bringing enough unique utility that druids themselves don't bring. Cyclone is awesome, but Resto druids and especially Feral druids have it. Another answer is that they probably need a little more on-demand burst. I'll argue with anyone who thinks Balance druids don't bring a ton of damage when they are left unmolested. However, they don't always have that on-demand big hit to finish someone off when they're low.

Warlock DPS<br />
I'm sorry, but I find a lot of this to be QQ. &quot;I can't top the meters, so it must be my class that's to blame. Now my raid is going to sit me.&quot; If you're playing a warlock and your raid is seriously considering sitting you just because you're a warlock, you need to spend some more time doing Internet research. If your raid is considering sitting you because of your personal performance issues, I would also suggest doing some more research.<br />
<br />
If you look at some of the PTR parses, there are fights (or at least certain individuals) who are topping the damage meters as Affliction. At the same time, we're not very worried that Destruction is going to somehow vanish. I suspect Demonology's dps is still a little low, but because of their buff they are still going to be somewhat popular in PvE. To be clear, that's not an ideal design and the kind of thing we're trying to move away from, but it's better than Demonology being a dead spec. (By comparison, Subtlety is largely dead in progression-focused raiding, which we consider a much bigger failure.)<br />
<br />
And I don't at all mean that there aren't aspects of the warlock class that need improving, and we have already announced some of them coming up for Catalcysm. But all of this &quot;Locks are going to be Sunwelled&quot; is a little overblown. Let's try and focus more on actual mechanic discussions and less &quot;I read that I was bad.&quot;<br />
<br />
[...] We don't put a ton of faith into highest dps ever ranks or simulation output unless it is very carefully analyzed. Sadly it almost never is. Usually it is just linked or someone says &quot;Simulationcraft shows us as the lowest, etc.&quot;)<br />
<br />
If you really love analyzing highest dps contests, I would recommend doing something like going to World of Logs and looking at the highest damage done on Heroic 25 Northrend beasts. I suspect you will find a lot of locks high on that list. If you find a few rogues above the locks, or you think there are more rogues overall, I'm not sure that means &quot;locks always lose.&quot; I'm also not sure you could get a lot of meaningful data out of looking at 25 normal, given how on farm that is for so many guilds.<br />
<br />
Now if you look at something like Yogg, warlocks will be all over that list. We've seen locks high on the PTR runs, but of course the sample size is small and the PTR tends to select either for very progression-oriented guilds and for players just messing around who want to see the content. We'll have better numbers once the sample size is in the thousands.<br />
<br />
But again, interpret those lists in context. You can't directly translate &quot;Who was ever able to do the highest dps on a given fight&quot; as &quot;My guild would benefit from swapping me out with another mage.&quot; If you aren't doing 8000 dps on Northrend Beasts (and very few of you are, especially heroic) then I don't know how relevant it is that the best hunter in the world does more damage on that fight than the best warlock in the world.<br />
<br />
P.S. Those players talking about specific mechanics or concerns they have about the class are doing the kind of thing we want to see in these forums. I don't have the bandwidth to answer every question but I try and hit some of them when I can. If your post pretty much says &quot;We're terrible and Blizzard doesn't care,&quot; then that's QQ, and that's not really what we (and I suspect most readers) want to see here.

I'm sorry, but I find a lot of this to be QQ. &quot;I can't top the meters, so it must be my class that's to blame&quot;..<br />
If you're playing a warlock and your raid is seriously considering sitting you just because you're a warlock, you need to spend some more time doing Internet research. If your raid is considering sitting you because of your personal performance issues, I would also suggest doing some more research.<br />
oh wow, so you think this is a l2p issue, blame the players, everything allright with the class, nothing to see here ? You have a bunch of progression guild warlocks telling you over and over that their dps sucks and is only going to get worse in icc because they don't scale.

They aren't 5% better. They are hundreds of percentage points better. Therefore, obsessing over a 5% buff for your class won't affect your success rate nearly as much as improving your game. I'm not terribly sympathetic to arguments that you can't improve your group's performance at all, and if that's really the case (which I find unlikely), why are you worried about hard modes anyway? The normal modes of raids are designed to be completed by most groups with any interest in raiding. Most of these players would barely detect a 5% buff or nerf to stamina. They will get far more out of making sure Demo Shout or Curse of Elements are up 100% of the time or even swapping their gems.<br />
<br />
Man, that's just the most awesome quote ever. Basically in a nutshell he said if you're complaining, you're in a bad (well, he said average, but if &quot;average&quot; is &quot;doesn't know how to keep CoE or its equivalent on the boss&quot; then his average is what most I know of would consider bad) guild and need to lrn2play, even lrn2gem. Priceless. :)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Ok, so I did that:<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
I suspect his definition of &quot;high on that list&quot; is different from yours. Probably &quot;a lot&quot; too. Ignoring the top 15 and calling them RNG outliers (since they're on a very steep curve compared to the dps steps below that), the top dps on that fight is 8381. Typical margin of error of +/-3% just based on crit streaks and the like even among the non-outliers means anyone between 7900 and 8381 (center of +/-3% @ 8137) is tied for top dps in a &quot;normal&quot; encounter. 214th place is the first with dps below 7900, so count the number of each class between 16th and 213th and you have how many TIED for first on Beasts.<br />
<br />
Mage: 61<br />
Hunter: 55<br />
Rogue: 44<br />
Druid (all cats): 14<br />
DK: 10<br />
Warlock: 9<br />
Shaman (ele): 1<br />
Warrior: 1<br />
Priest: 1<br />
<br />
So, the data still as far as I'm concerned says warlocks need help, though to use Ghostcrawler's words, there are 9 locks &quot;high on that list&quot;, which he might consider &quot;a lot&quot;. Somehow.<br />
<br />
It'd be better if I only counted unique *players* as well, but it took long enough just to count them without ignoring duplicate players in different runs. Population will also skew the results somewhat, but I doubt there are in real population one sixth as many warlocks as mages. (The fact a shadow priest even tied for top damage in one parse shows what outliers can do and why I threw out the top 15. I don't think anyone would consider shadow priests strong right now. The top 15 are basically the other class versions of that shadow priest.)<br />
<br />
Beasts aren't the best fight in the world to compare folks on (melee in particular have a heck of a time, getting knocked back constantly), but ToC doesn't really have anything Patchwerk-like so it's hard to pick a fight to use as baseline in general.<br />
<br />
So while I do agree with your end point (that even the data Ghostcrawler seems to ignore shows warlocks are weak at the moment), I disagree with you calling 31st in the world ever &quot;not near the top&quot;. Anyone 213th and up is functionally tied in real statistical terms.</div></div><hr />

the same as yours: warlocks don't top NRB. he was saying you top on other fights in the game, so the potential for high DPS is there, fight mechanics may simply favor other classes more.</div></div><hr />

I really do not see where all the QQ is coming from. In my guild I can easily crack 6K - 7K burst DPS, averaging around 5.5K throughout the duration of the fight. I only have 3 pieces of T9.5, couple Ony 25 drops, and a few Triumph badge items. Given currently, stats such as SP, Spirit, Crit, etc. all play a big role on the damage you output - but ultimately what I've learned over the years comes down to something very simplistic. Rotation. Alot of your DPS is in your rotation. You can have 3K unbuffed SP, 40% crit, 400 haste, etc. etc. yet still under perform if you do not have the right rotation down. <br />
<br />
Yes, the hunters and rogues in my guild near 7K - 8K DPS, thats just how it is. But honestly, at the end of the day....it's just a game lol. If your guild is sitting you out due to your characters performance, well, then that guild simply is not for you or you really need to look at how to play your toon.</div></div><hr />

WOW. GC just went off the deep end of elitism. He honestly just told 95% of the player base that they all suck and made it sound a lot like they really did just design the hard modes for 5% of the guilds. I don't have the obsession or the drive to be a 5% guild (I have an actual LIFE outside of the game I don't get paid to play). I think GC should really think before he types. He is a horrible, horrible PR person. I'm glad to know that if I'm not in that 5% he could give a damn less about my concerns although realistically its that 95% that pays for the game not that 5%. Here I was thinking WoW made improvements to their attitudes that only 5% should see the top content, but obvious that never happened. They just started thinking that only 5% should see hard modes instead. So, that means every moment they spend on hard modes is paid for by 95% and played by 5%. How fun! Then again, when they balance around arenas which are participated in by less than 5% it shouldn't come as a shock to anyone.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daez</div><div class="date">2009-12-04, 02:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm going to talk mostly about Arenas here, because I think that's where most of you are coming from. BG balance is a surprisingly different beast, and the one on one &quot;ganked in Stranglethorn&quot; or duel situation is just a lot less important.<br />
<br />
<br />
For sure! Its those 2v2, 3v3 and 5v5 duels that matter. We all know that! *GROANS!*<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
What does a Balance druid bring to the table? Why have one instead of just getting e.g. a mage, hunter or shaman? Yeah the obvious answer is to give everyone some form of Mortal Strike. We don't think that's the only answer though. Even if you assume MS is mandatory, there are enough classes that have it now that you should be able to bring MS and a healer and have room for a Boomkin as your third. <br />
<br />
<br />
Balance druids bring NOTHING to the table. I assume you are talking about Earth and Moon (which if the only reason to take a Boomkin is Earth and Moon you are going to take a warlock that can cast Curse of the Elements and still have a much larger tool box). No one will ever take a Boomkin just for Earth and Moon. 5% crit in PvP is also crap. Haste to a certain extent isn't as good in PvP as it is in PvE. Spell hit means very little. Everything that a Moonkin offers is offered by classes with more survivability and better burst damage leaving them out in the cold in every single comp that wants to get to the top of Arenas. Of course, if you study trends the way you claim to every time you mention tanks...YOU ALREADY KNOW THIS! <br />
<br />
Also, Moonkins shouldn't be compared to every single class because they are a hybrid. They should be compared to other specs of their class (after all if you want to arena you just need to respec right) and Moonkins in both PvE and PvP are a waste of space compared to Feral (both bear and cat) and Restoration druids. You don't bring a Boomkin because you need one (spriest covers the +hit, paladin covers the haste, fire mage covers the crit and warlock covers the +damage). You bring a Boomkin because you don't have enough of the classes I just mentioned and are left with no other choice.</div></div><hr />

anyway, you would be surprised to find that the top 5% of guilds only play &quot;alot&quot; when the push through new content is out, overall though, they tend to play much less than the casual player. why? it takes the casual a lot longer to clear an instance than it does that top 5% guild. when people make the accusation of no life or paid to play, it comes down to insecurity. i personally feel they are right when they talk about top guilds, the players there actually know and care to gem/chant/profession properly, while there are a lot of casual guilds that don't care that much. it'd be like designing a maybach or maserati around the driving skills of a soccer mom.</div></div><hr />

for some reason i think increasing health and reducing healing wont exactly fix the burst potential within PvP.<br />
or it might just turn Arena back into those long fights again.<br />
<br />
ahwell, to soon to argue about that i guess.<br />
<br />
<br />
Arena is dead in Cataclysm. The point is moot! The ONLY reason people do arena right now is because its where you get the best gear for PvP. Once Cataclysm comes out (as confirmed yet again by the blues), rated BGs where be where the best PvP gear comes from, and you can't lose points there you can only gain them, so it really turns into simply farming the rated battle grounds for PvP gear.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In all fairness, this is a problem that is left over from anyone that played Vanilla and TBC. The truth is that for the last 4 years or so you were top dps as a warlock (right under or competing with rogues) no matter how you played as long as you weren't completely clueless. When they buffed the hell out of other classes in WotLK to put them on par it became harder to hit the top 5 if you were clueless. Yes, your guild mate is clueless. I would personally tell him to shape up or ban him from raids. There is a huge difference between players that try to be the best and don't have the gear for it although they know what they are doing and clueless people that just like to complain. Normally, that person that isn't competing well although they know what they are supposed to do burn out quickly and no longer ask for raid spots. You see a lot of this in horde which is why guilds have horrible issues finding a shadow priest or a boomkin that are willing to raid due to how dps failure those classes are even though they are utility classes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Warlocks were top dps with rogues for 4 years. The problem is that WotLK really made it quite possible for all physical dps classes to beat out all casters. Its not even close anymore. To be honest, I think they need to nerf hunters/rogues/warriors/dks/paladins instead of buffing warlocks. Then they need to add about 5 more minutes to every enrage timer (unless they are willing to do away with enrage timers entirely). Enrage timers are the stupidest thing ever invented in the game. If a guild wants to spend 30 minutes on an encounter to down it and can somehow keep everyone alive for 30 minutes then they should be able to without worrying about beating the enrage timer.</div></div><hr />

My guess is they don't give a damn. This is the last arena season that will ever matter in the game (there won't be another until Cataclysm where the gear comes from rated battle grounds and no one gives a damn about arenas). You might see them go out of their way to buff the hell out of Moonkins in Cataclysm (like was the case with retribution paladins in WotLK).</div></div><hr />

He honestly just told 95% of the player base that they all suck and made it sound a lot like they really did just design the hard modes for 5% of the guilds. I don't have the obsession or the drive to be a 5% guild (I have an actual LIFE outside of the game I don't get paid to play). I think GC should really think before he types. He is a horrible, horrible PR person. I'm glad to know that if I'm not in that 5% he could give a damn less about my concerns although realistically its that 95% that pays for the game not that 5%. Here I was thinking WoW made improvements to their attitudes that only 5% should see the top content, but obvious that never happened. They just started thinking that only 5% should see hard modes instead. So, that means every moment they spend on hard modes is paid for by 95% and played by 5%. How fun! Then again, when they balance around arenas which are participated in by less than 5% it shouldn't come as a shock to anyone. <br />
<br />
<br />
I think you're misreading. What he's saying is: <br />
<br />
&quot;Hard modes are hard. We made hard modes hard on purpose. We want hard modes to be hard even for really, really good players who are in the top 5% of the player base. Therefore if you are not in the top 5% of the player base, please stop complaining that we need to buff you so you can roflstomp hard modes. It's not going to happen, because then they would cease to be 'hard' modes.&quot;<br />
<br />
It's simple math. As GC points out the, the very best players are *way* better than the average players. In the past this meant that in order to provide a challenge to the very best players, raids had to be setup so that average players would never see them. Hard modes changed that. They allow average players to raid while still giving Blizzard room to make much more challenging fights for those top 5%. If they buff player performance or debuff bosses to the point where 50 percent of the player base can play hard modes, then they will cease to *be* hard modes, and cease to be challenging to the very best players.<br />
<br />
Those very best players might only be 5% of the player base, but they are an important 5%. They're the guys that figure out and write boss strats, write add-ons for the community, post videos for everyone to drool over, etc. Blizzard has to give them *something*. If they disappear it's only a matter of time before the other 95% follow them to the next &quot;big thing&quot;. <br />
<br />
I'm not a hard core. I get as peeved as anyone by the elitist 'OMG casuals are ruining the game!' shit you see posted, but I'm also not foolish enough to think that the entire game should be built around 40 or 50% of the population being able to clear all content including hard modes. <br />
<br />
GC is right... When I can barely put a 10 man raid together because of scheduling conflicts, when I *still* can't convince our recently acquired hunter (who I can't get rid of because she is the only reliable 10th I have) to stop using Ele Shammy gear, when I out-heal our guild's &quot;Healing officer&quot; on my alt, I don't need to be worrying about hard modes. I consider myself better than average. I may even border on &quot;good&quot; (certainly I'm nearly always in top 5 DPS when I run 25's with other guilds); but unless I can either fix my guild or finally break down and leave the people I like for the people that will help me progress, I don't need to be worrying about squeezing another 50 or 100 DPS out of my rotation. It's immaterial, we couldn't do a hard mode if I could get my personal DPS up to 10K. I need to be worrying about making sure that all the normal average players in my guild are gemmed right, enchanted right, using appropriate gear for their class, staying out of the fire, etc.</div></div><hr />

So the fact that you can bypass lolfall and pick up NS which allows you to put any spell in your nature arsenal (including roots) on an instant cast every three minutes isn't enough? How about Nature's Grasp? How about war stomp (horde)? Seriously, the only place moonkins can really complain about PvP failure on a constant basis is arenas and even Blizzard gave up on trying to balance classes for 2v2 3v3 5v5 because its simply impossible to fine tune the classes that well without screwing over every other aspect of the game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, the hunters and rogues in my guild near 7K - 8K DPS, thats just how it is. But honestly, at the end of the day....it's just a game lol. If your guild is sitting you out due to your characters performance, well, then that guild simply is not for you or you really need to look at how to play your toon.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ok for starters, any decent progression guild will sit you if you are not bringing the dps that another class is and lack any unique class mechanics that make you worth bringing (which ironically means that solo demonology lock will probably get into the group easier than the locks doing more dps because they bring a powerful spell power buff, a 13% spell damage buff and a 5% crit buff is specced correctly). Its kind of weird to think of warlocks as a utility class but demonology is arguably the top caster buff class in the game right now although they are a pure.<br />
<br />
Also, doesn't it irk you just a little bit that hunters and rogues that can easily beat your dps have no set rotations and just have to use whatever ability is off cool down as soon as it is off cool down. You honestly think its fair that you should have to be a master at the rotation and do less dps? I think you are possibly insane if you think that. How come the game is currently set up to allow those with very little skill to faceroll higher dps and classes that require skill and rotations do lower dps and damage? It seems fubared!</div></div><hr />

<br />
They were to completely unrelated topics. So, there was absolutely no double post.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
anyway, you would be surprised to find that the top 5% of guilds only play &quot;alot&quot; when the push through new content is out,<br />
<br />
<br />
They play from TC to farm much more than any casual plays. I think you confused casual with bad. Most casuals play around 2-3 hours a week no matter what week it is. Stop confusing casuals with bad. I play on average 1-2 days a week 2-3 hours a day. Don't even try to tell me that progression guilds don't require 20 hours a week of raiding because I will show you guild site after guild site that tells you not to even bother applying if you won't give every night to raiding (and even more on progression nights). I simply chose to have my nights for what I want to do. That doesn't mean I should be penalized for it. I never once said that progression guilds shouldn't get better gear since they play more. I simply said that GC's attitude was that anyone that wasn't in a top 5% guild was simply not worth addressing.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
why? it takes the casual a lot longer to clear an instance than it does that top 5% guild. <br />
<br />
<br />
This is simply NOT true at all. You give a good casual player a decent group of good casual players and they will clear that instance just as quickly as a top guild (on normal mode) assuming that everyone knows the fights and the group has strong leadership. YET AGAIN, you are CONFUSING casual with bad! Casual players never really bother with hard modes, so its impossible to make a comparison on that basis.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
it comes down to insecurity<br />
<br />
<br />
Insecurity about what? When people try to boast about their in game achievements and their world/server first it comes down to them having no life. I have many things I take pride in. I have many accomplishments. Not a single one of them is related to WoW. I don't live inside my computer. The achievements I have in real life actually matter. The achievements you have in a video game have absolutely no bearing on anything at all. Go try to sell your world first to an employer in a review or an interview and see just how impressed they are. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
i personally feel they are right when they talk about top guilds, the players there actually know and care to gem/chant/profession properly<br />
<br />
<br />
Making the assumption that everyone not in a top guild doesn't give a damn about how to spec/gem/gear/enchant/profession properly is simply freaking insane. Then again, you don't seem to grasp the concept that casual =/= bad. That could be because you simply fail to see how giving 20 hours a week to the game doesn't make you all uber and think that in game accomplishments actually mean anything at all in the greater scheme of things.</div></div><hr />

If players in average or bad guilds notice a trend where they get benched for others (let's say warriors for paladins), but this trend totally doesn't happen in the &quot;elite&quot; guilds, what does that mean ? It means that the difference as percieved at the average/bad level doesn't have nearly the same impact when all the raid plays their class well. ie if those players played better they wouldn't get benched.<br />
Of course there's a problem of degree (ie if the healer team let's the tank die once on each fight a paladin is obviously going to be much better for them), but can you really base a complaint on the fact that the healer team is that bad ?<br />
<br />
It's not about ignoring thing that happen below a certain level of skill, it's about comparing trends from several sides to separate skill problems and class balance issues.</div></div><hr />

And just a pointer too you about moonkins, from a moonkin. :)<br />
The thing that divides a good moonkin, from a bad moonkin, is the way they handle their very RNG dependant rotation.<br />
A bad moonkin that don't know the right tools too beat that RNG is stuck on 3-4.5k Dps.<br />
And a good moonkin, that have geared them selfes the right way, and know how too beat that RNG (as good as you possible can), will do good Dps, not on the top with Ferals and Hunters, but still better then certain classes.<br />

You have a bunch of progression guild warlocks telling you over and over that their dps sucks and is only going to get worse in icc because they don't scale. Sure, rolling a 2 button arcane mage will fix it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Yes, he's right. It is a l2p issue. My lock, in far less gear, is comparable to my rogue in dps. Now, fight mechanics are different. If it's too mobile, i'll not perform well. That's just the nature of the beast as far as destruction goes. I've also seen better warlocks than me, in equal gear, destroy me. So yes, we all have room for improvement. RNG also plays in heavily especially with a class that has such high single ability damage.</div></div><hr />

But i tried this spec once, all it did was: i healed better and my dps dropped a shitload. If u got a 1 instant cast every 3min it may save you 1 time but after that.... lolo...<br />

I dont think that its necessarily warlock dps is too low. I think it has to do more with how complicated our mechanics are to keep our dps maximized. Keeping dots up without clipping, lifetap every 40sec, keep pet alive, keep ourselves alive, keep rotation in between dots. We aren't just a spam one or two buttons and /meltface class. Also, I dont think some people realize that we do not shine when it comes to trash mobs.</div></div><hr />

It means that the difference as percieved at the average/bad level doesn't have nearly the same impact when all the raid plays their class well. ie if those players played better they wouldn't get benched.<br />
<br />
Nail on the head right here. What GC was trying to say without saying it directly is that the people whining about x class being better than y class to the degree that they're being forced to sit out are really being benched because they're not playing their class well/right.<br />
<br />
And they came to that conclusion by the fact that this is not a problem in the top guilds, where the top players are playing the classes well/right. People don't want to hear that, though. People don't want to admit their own shortcomings and would rather blame it on the game or class design/balance.</div></div><hr />

Yes, because your inability to out dps your lock on your rogue is representative of the rest of the warlock community... Take a look at worldoflogs, or wowmeters. Get an idea of the numbers on average over a large sample size. Warlocks are not in a pure dps class position right now. It’s not QQ, it’s based on &quot;facts&quot; and &quot;evidence&quot;.</div></div><hr />

These kind of uninformed, &quot;my buddy did this&quot; posts drive me crazy. One of the big issue with Warlocks is scaling.

Now in TOC, we are far behind, falling below many hybrid classes, even in cases where we have superior gear and skill.<br />

Nature's Swiftness has a 3 minute cd, and it allows the druid to cast a nature spell instantly. You could make that same ability slightly more available, like the same location as Intensity is now, or put it deep into the balance tree, attached to something else, and make it so that it affects Arcane spells as well. An instant cast Starfire to start a fight or begin it would be an incredible boon, and the 3 min cd on the ability is self-limiting. <br />

<br />
&quot;I keep up&quot; Good for you on just being mediocre. I'm far from a bad player. I push the same numbers as any top warlock, even beating some in full BiS gear, but even I can recognize that we have many shortcomings. The problem is not that our DPS is just straight bad, it's just that it's not where it should be. Especially for those of us that are in 258s.<br />
<br />
In regards to what GC said.. he's right and he's wrong. Warlocks seem to either be really good or really bad. The bad need to at least get to the level of the good before they preach about how low our DPS is. I can see where he gets off saying research needs to be done, but at the same time he needs to quit trolling people that pay his mortgage and do some research himself. We are a pure DPS class and to see top end warlocks be destroyed by rogues, hunters, mages and even some hybrids here and there is disappointing. It's not as if we supply any crucial raid buffs either, so there's no reason to have more than one warlock. I play in a guild that has ToGC 25 tributes and what have you and we have three warlocks. One has been in the guild longer than myself, has more dkp and thusly has better gear but it's widely believed I'm the better player overall. However, because demonic pact scales with spellpower he is their first choice for Anub'Arak and I get sat for mages. How is this fair? You can call it QQ and perhaps it's a little biterness, but at the same time you've completely butchered a class. This is only ONE example of how useless we've become. The only fight they can say we do decently on is Yogg. Everything in ToGC is unfriendly to us. Look at those parses he told you to look at. There may be the occasional warlock in there somewhere, but if you gather them as a whole you will find dozens and dozens of every other pure dps class over us. So, he's going to justify his laziness by saying you might occasionally find a parse with a warlock on top? I'm sorry, but that's not good enough. We're so RNG based, so chances are that warlock got lucky. All we can do is DPS, therefore, us being lower on the totem pole is a significant issue. They're removing a very important stat from our T10, so then what? It's yet another nerf to our class that goes unmentioned. I currently get roughly 600SP from spirit. There goes that stat. And don't even get me started on our total lack of splash dmg/decent AoE.<br />
<br />
It's unfortunate that they continue to nerf PvE because of PvP as well. Rather than fixing how PvP works and doing something like giving battlegrounds and arenas a kind of debuff that changes how your spells work, they keep taking away important PvE abilities or nerfing them into the ground. Sure, affliction is getting a buff, but affliction DPS wouldn't be top in 3.3 if they didn't destroy conflag.</div></div><hr />

Now, I wont say that you &quot;suck&quot; or that you're a &quot;noob&quot;, but pulling 4.5k DPS in a mix of 245/232 gear is indeed low for a rogue.

Just because you pay to be a customer of Blizzard doesn't give you the right to direct how they develop or what they do. You have the right to stop paying and being a customer if you don't like their decisions, but that's all you have. It's not like owning money or a controlling interest (even a small one) in a company.</div></div><hr />

There is nothing wrong with the locks dps. I can push way over 8k on any tank and spank boss. The problem is people are comparing at completely different levels. People place far too much emphasis on simcraft lists. They mean nothing. There is a moonkin in my guild in mainly 10 man gear that can push over 7-8k on alot of fights. I have seen elemental shamans do up to 7k, i have seen every single other class (apart from shadow priests) outperform. You have to realise that you can't compare your dps in your guild based on a Best in slot geared list on a Patchwerk fight. It NEVER works like that. You will always have certain classes excelling on different fights. Warlocks are very consistent, they can do good dps on all fights. <br />
<br />
Those of you who QQ about their low dps, take it from me, you can do good dps, because others of the same class can. Do yourself a favour and research your class, min/max, do whatever you have to do. But at the end of the day, any guild leader sitting out a lock just because its a lock need to stop playing, like now. Because they don't understand how the game works and they are not benefiting themself playing or anyone else. If a similar geared mage and lock are doing way different dps, one of them is doing something badly wrong. If one is badly geared and the other good, then the good one will be taken. Is that to do with the class? no! that is to do with the gear. See?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bonkuro</div><div class="date">2009-12-05, 01:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't see the reasoning in not taking the trends of the top 5% raiding guilds as some sort of criteria for what certain classes need. <br />
<br />
What it boils down to, some classes have more utility than others, and something that should be done by a certain class can be done better by another, or avoided altogether means you have either failed in creating a niche for a class, or you have failed in creating an encounter in which it is super painful for a guild to go without said class. <br />
<br />
The sort of reasoning is an insult to the intelligence of those who read the, &quot;blue posts.&quot; <br />
<br />
The top 5% should be paid attention to, the same as the rest of the raiding guilds. The top 5% are going to have the greater understanding of encounters, greater ability to execute plans for such encounters, and should be telling you the end game, hard to accept truth, that sometimes these geeks and nerds playing on your engine have a better understanding of it than you do. <br />
<br />
Learn from your mistakes, fix them.. Don't sit there, and shoot underhanded implications that, &quot;Well, you suck and it doesn't matter what they do, because you aren't them.&quot; Some of us just might be in those top 5% raiding guilds with mains, or alts sitting out that we would prefer to play, but you failed to make them needed. <br />
<br />
Cheers.</div></div><hr />

These features simply aren't included with your subscription fees. The monthly subscription rate didn't increase once these options were added. None of the paid services are necessary to play the game as advertised. Your subscription fees help us to maintain customer support, developing new content for each patch cycle, connect to and maintain our realms, allow us to store your account/character data, etc.&quot;<br />
<br />
So what exactly are you guys doing with the roughly $100-150 mil per month you make from account fees that you already accumulate?<br />
<br />
WoW subscribers: Estimated 12 mil<br />
Monthly Fee: $14.95<br />
Estimated Income from fees: $179 mil<br />
<br />
Let's just call it $100-150 mil since not every country has the exact same subscription model. As an example, I do believe the Chinese, and maybe a large part of Asia have a different subscription model since they play a lot in internet cafes from what I have read.<br />
<br />
That's still a huge amount of incoming money. So is charging $30 for a faction transfer, or $25 for a realm transfer really necessary? Why not cut those fees in half? It's hard for me to believe that these fees are necessary for the support staff to operate. And I find the last bit a little funny...<br />
<br />
&quot;allow us to store your account/character data, etc.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lol, what in the hell were you guys doing before you had these fees? You make it sound like you don't even own your hardware.</div></div><hr />

I'm guessing if it were cheaper, the crappy realms would die out pretty quickly. I for one would've rolled out from my realm a long while ago if the transfer only costed for example $10. Also, why make it cheaper if people are willing to pay $30 and $25? Now that would just be stupid.<br />
If people dont like the price now, dont use the service. They will lower the price if enough people agree with you</div></div><hr />
