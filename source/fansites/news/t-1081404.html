Ulduar Encounter Difficulty<br />
There was recently a blue post (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/216399-please-bring-back-whoever-designed-ulduar/) talking about the nostalgia people feel for Ulduar and the increased difficulty. Kaivax made the point that &quot;Ulduar is an example of a raid where lots of players got to enjoy the first few bosses, and very few players ever saw the last few&quot;. <br />
<br />
Ulduar isn't too relevant anymore, as we saw yesterday (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/2646-Algalon-Solo-Kill-Iron-Man-WoW-Challenge-MVP-Program-Transmog-Gallery-MMO-Report) with a Hunter soloing Algalon, but we wanted to see how significant the drop-off of players was as the bosses got more difficult, so we looked at a sample that contains ~130k level 85 characters that completed Ulduar achievements before Patch 3.2 was released. The percentages in the chart are normalized to 100% for The Siege of Ulduar (10 player) (http://db.mmo-champion.com/a/2886/the-siege-of-ulduar-10-player/). <br />
<br />
This means that we are looking at boss difficulty relative to the easiest bosses, not the percent of the player population that completed each encounter. Keep in mind there is some inaccuracy, as the characters that made it to 85 may not include many of the characters who completed it at level 80 and then became inactive. <br />
<br />
Ultimately, out of the 100% players who completed The Siege of Ulduar (10 player) (http://db.mmo-champion.com/a/2886/the-siege-of-ulduar-10-player/), only 1.1% of them defeated Algalon in 10-man before Patch 3.2 was released. The 25-man version was even less accessible and only 0.38% of the sampled players completed the encounter. <br />

Love Is In The Air, So Wear A Mask<br />
With the onset of Valentine’s Day, thoughts of romance and companionship plague the air like a masterfully-designed virus. Not even the realm of my dark masters is safe, for Azeroth is currently teeming with positive emotions due to the “Love Is In The Air” festivities.<br />
<br />
To further my understanding of these alien thought processes, I request your favorite canonical pairing in the Warcraft universe and why you believe this pairing works. These pairings do not need to be of the flushed quadrant; your favorite examples of companionship, friendship, or “bromance” are also needed. Should you provide this information, you are then entitled to also include your most desired pairing, but only if you also provide adequate reasoning for this union.<br />
<br />
In order to ensure proper formatting, below is an example:<br />
<br />
Favorite Pairing:<br />
Reasoning:<br />
<br />
Desired Pairing: A’dal (void state) / Xi'ri (void state)<br />
Reasoning: So turn the Lights off / I'm not afraid / Afraid of the Dark (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/217387-love-is-in-the-air-so-wear-a-mask/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/4063006294))<br />

<br />
Whether you're a tank, a healer, or a damage dealer, &quot;Break the Trees&quot; is sure to be a treat. Check it out below or visit Sharm's official page on YouTube (http://www.youtube.com/user/taintedlore?ob=0). <br />

I was in one of those raids that took down Algalon 25-man pre-3.2. The sense of accomplishment of beating that pain in the rear encounter tops anything I have done in the game. If everyone were farming Algalon for months before I beat it, the sense of accomplishment would be greatly diminished.<br />
<br />
I think there is a middle ground between. .3% and 90%.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As for Ulduar, it was difficult, but I was totally okay with that actually. My guild was like 12/12 normal 3/12 heroic when ToC came out like 6 months later. It took us at least 2 months to get all of normal down. For Dragon Soul, we got normal down in 2 weeks. Firelands took 4 weeks, and T11 was a month and a half.<br />
<br />
As Cataclysm has gone on, we've gotten less and less raid content (after you account for difficulty), which is disappointing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Honestly, Algalon was not more difficult than Yogg+1 or Yogg+0, but the 1 hour time limit was the main problem as well as the requirement of having beaten Firefighter (which was hell back then, even after the first nerf to it).</div></div><hr />

Eh I can compare it to Yogg+1 and Firefighter - ( Nerfed Version) Personally however Zero is in a league of It's own. Good memories I say; Pretty sure I never did Pre-nerfed Fire fighter unfortunately to compare it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Imo, Algalon was harder then yogg+1 but on about the same level as firefighter. It took us longer to get firefighter done then Algalon.<br />
<br />
Then again, i enjoined progressing trough ulduar and the hardmodes more then i do these days, we got yogg and most hardmodes down before the patch, but even working on the last hardmodes and Algalon afer the patch was still a challenge.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I also didn't expect only 1% of the poll voters to start to in Cataclysm, I could see maybe 5 or 10%, but 1% a lot less than I thought. A lot of the people I used to know from Vanilla aren't even around now. Then again, I remember a poll on the front page here of asking if you currently played or not, and I believe 40% said no, so I suppose we have a lot of people who like to hang around the awesome MMO-C forums. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Our progression here I believe was hmm if I remember correctly, We had progressed through ToC Hm's and such and our GM decided. Okay we are going back to do Algalon and Yogg Zero. Even with ToC gear we still struggled and Algalon was going to break our guild however that didn't happen and we killed it and yogg zero few days after.<br />
<br />
Wish I got to experience Pre-nerfed firefighter. Such a shame</div></div><hr />

<br />
In general it was just a good flawless raid, Compared to ToC and a year + 1/2 Of ICC? Uldaur takes the cake. Not even to list Naxx there.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nekobaka</div><div class="date">2012-02-14, 06:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well Algalon was purposefully designed to be out of reach for most players and considered optional content, so the completion rate is of no surprise. Add on the one hour timer which doesnt allow players to overcome mistakes and learning curves with a brute force of many hours upon hours of wipes.<br />
<br />
Less than a quarter of the population that raided Ulduar cleared the raid while it was current and yet players seemed to have been happy. <br />
<br />
I was a bit surprised at first with the 10 man Decent in the Madness being a tad lower as that was the version I progressed and cleared in a once a week group that was formed from random friends and other friends with a few being carried.<br />
<br />
I find it weird how the content patch days have gotten far smoother than in WotLK and in particular to Ulduar which was very buggy at launch and yet Ulduar was just so well made otherwise and raids like DS are just poor quality on the fun side(IMO).</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Desdonde</div><div class="date">2012-02-14, 06:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Algalon honestly was not that difficult, the 1 hour timer is what made it tough, compared to Firefighter/Yogg 1, I would easily say that Algalon was easier. You just needed good raid coordination and excellent healers to prevent tank gibs. Firefighter required a hell of a lot more coordination.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
The sample size is from players that have raided/cleared the place before 3.2, so it obviously doesn't include any post 3.2/WotLK kills.<br />
<br />
The troll hunter on mount art looks pretty awesome, and the Sylvanas one looks pretty good aswell.</div></div><hr />

Not, clearing normal in 1 to 2 weeks, then &quot;progress&quot; on hardmodes for the next 6months or more.It also had amazing lore leading up to it, and tying it all together. They did a good job in there.</div></div><hr />

If wow was as good as the MMO forums I would still be playing :)<br />

Yeah ulduar will be the last epic raid for true raiders, with LFR unfortunately no matter how good they make the raid it will never feel epic. So they may aswell keep the standard at DS level.</div></div><hr />

People always get to &quot;see the content&quot; at a later date anyway.<br />
<br />
People clearly love the place, so I assume they loved the way you always had something new to look forward to after you killed your next boss. I'm sure those people agree with me that having a mechanic or two different in heroic is not nearly as awesome.<br />
<br />
As someone else said, all that graph shows is that bosses get harder as they go along, which has somehow been morphed by Blizzard's logic to be a terrible thing they must avoid.</div></div><hr />

The graph is based on the percentage of raiders who did it while it was still current content and not based on anything that happens in the present.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Idletime</div><div class="date">2012-02-14, 06:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ulduar was well tuned for guilds that were at least somewhat capable. During that time I was with a guild that had completed Yogg with 3 lights up and if I remember correctly we were considered a top 2500 guild. Ulduar pushed me to look for a better guild because we were simply not able to do the more important achievements so I completed No Lights the week prior to ToC release. I had been with my previous guild over a year and Ulduar remains to this day (for me) a mark of a raider. This is the disconnect in today's WoW - Blizzard has made the game more about the content and less about being capable of clearing it with constant nerfing. They've removed an important carrot that lead to things like improving your play, knowing your class mechanics, doing what it took to get further, and understanding the makeup of a competent raid. I personally don't believe it's important for everyone to see the content. Video games have ALWAYS been about one thing - being good enough to see it through to the end, and having the ability to repeat it. During Vanilla and BC, I don't think the screams of &quot;I Paid, Therefore...&quot; were not nearly as loud. They turned the tables and started allowing people to believe that they had an absolute entitlement to catch up. This was a loss for the raiding world. I knew people I was clearing AQ40 with tell me they would be back for the next patch when they would give gear for dungeon points. Disgusting to hear, actually. You knew the people were capable of so much more but they got bored very easily. This is ultimately what made me lose interest in WoW. Part of the fun in raiding hard content is knowing that you are doing something that others will be striving for and will be envious of. You had people in the raid that learned their jobs, that spent time actually figuring it out and not just pushing buttons. Even if you are in a backwater guild on a backwater server, hitting #3 server content wise is a personal achievement. You did it because you belonged in the raid, not because you had some arbitrary ilvl that meant you should be able to perform. Your people wanted to be there and didn't feel entitled to epic loots. I cancelled my account recently, I give the odds of me returning to WoW afterwards about 1 in 100. Am I holding on to some outdated progression model? Do I yearn for the days when you were with 39 other nerds and cleaning content out? Maybe. The game's mainstream and that means another raid like Ulduar will never be produced. It will be a game of Top 1000 World guilds clearing normal modes the first week, clearing Heroic mode within 2 more weeks, and everyone else clearing normal modes until nerfs. Not fun, not competitive, poorly designed, and lacking in inspiration. I blame money more than anything, but I control my money and it's going elsewhere.</div></div><hr />

Add on the one hour timer which doesnt allow players to overcome mistakes and learning curves with a brute force of many hours upon hours of wipes.<br />
<br />
Less than a quarter of the population that raided Ulduar cleared the raid while it was current and yet players seemed to have been happy.<br />
<br />
I'm glad someone else brought this up. From what I can see this is how a raid graph should look pre-nerf. Considering that Ulduar was out for 4 months and this was the result makes me feel that the difficulty was spot on. The lesser skilled players waited until ToC to experience Ulduar and it's hardmodes while the hardcore and semi-hardcore got to experience Ulduar in all of it's glory. Perfect tuning imo.<br />
<br />
I keep getting the feeling that the main &quot;this needs to be easier to be fun&quot; bs is coming from Todd Chilton. Of all the people on the panels he seems the most &quot;epix for all&quot; personality while GC and Corey Stockton almost roll their eyes at what he has to say...<br />
<br />
Edit: I'm also amazed at how many people are dismissing ICC as a very well put together and epic raid. IMO it was very well tuned at 0-10% buff. Beyond that it was faceroll. Hell I was in a top 3 server guild during ICC and the closest we got before the nerf (which killed the guild mind you) was normal Valithria. I personally feel that people equate the glory days of ICC to the 35% buff, but they forget the early gated days of the raid.</div></div><hr />

Never got to raiding, seeing as I quit after doing a 5 hour MC trash run with 25 peeps... where we wiped a lot and got 1 epic out of it. Started up again a week after BC started (took a free xfer off the server) and played until the (new guild I joined) guild decided to xfer. Came back shortly before Wrath... didn't join a new guild or do raiding, just pug stuff. Later I joined up when I hit 80, sailed though Naxx, had a rough time in Ulduar, ToC wasn't too bad. Ended up joining the elistist part of the guild that split into a new one, focusing on 10 man ICC (tried LK heroic once). That went until part way though cata when the (now smaller) guild started falling apart. Merged with another guild, which also started falling apart, but we managed to bring it back together, which is mostly how it stayed with peeps comming and going but staying a stable 10 man guild. Now in dragon soul we have occasional problems with attendance, but still manage to be one of the best guilds (tied for 1st with 1/8 heroic lol), but suffer from being on a low pop server.</div></div><hr />

A game like this really needs that type of high difficulty/high reward type of boss in it. It really motivates people, at least me and many others I have played with. If I am able to obtain the end boss experience through LFR, the odds of me enjoying the content for a long period of time is slim. It's all about keeping that subscription. When you work slowly through a dungeon, it is much more satisfying and fun. Ulduar was a fantastic instance.</div></div><hr />

Keep in mind there is some inaccuracy, as the characters that made it to 85 may not include many of the characters who completed it at level 80 and then became inactive.<br />
<br />
Actually, the graph shows a combination of boss difficulty and boss accessibility - no matter how hard or easy a boss is, if you can't get to it, you can't kill it. <br />
<br />
I think that Ulduar raiding was epic, but I also think that it was too inaccessible, and that, in general, it wasn't fun for 99.9% of the WoW population. I much prefer the current approach, where the fights are accessible and meaningful for a large portion of the WoW population, and have little sympathy for the whiners who complain that raids are &quot;too easy&quot; now, but are still working on hard modes. <br />
Sure, it may not feel as *elite* anymore, but that's just too bad. The game isn't made for the elite few, it's made for a much broader audience. <br />
<br />
Blizzard values raids and raid content, so they put lots of time and effort into creating it, and they WANT people to experience it. They don't want it to be elite, because that defeats their purpose as game creators and as a company. If you want an elite experience, well, that's why they made Hard Modes. If you're smart enough and focused enough and obsessed enough to be able to do hard modes, then you should be able to figure out that there is a big difference between LFR and Regular and Hard encounters, and not have your feelings hurt because LFR and Regular encounters exist and are accessible to the rest of us.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Raiding shouldn't be for everyone, but to a cheap studio like Blizzard, not only is it, but it's also everything, period, re-purposed, recycled, refitted for every last scrap of content in the game and that's why I no longer play. Nothing in this game is even mildly possessing of any mental stimuli until the end of end game. I think I'd rather drive a rail road spike through my palm than level anything again.</div></div><hr />

You compared normal achievements to the (pen?)ultimate heroic boss in the instance. I suppose for interests sake you could have comparisons between normal 10 man siege of Ulduar that was tuned so low that every many and his dog could kill it and one of the two hardests bosses of the tier designed only for heroic mode raiders but I don't see a lot of point to it. <br />
<br />
Algalon was created specifically to be a heroic only boss. I pointed that out to that Blue Poster in that thread. <br />
<br />
The thing is you cannot compare Algalon to the earlier bosses in an argument of accessibility when the boss was designed to be completed by only a few % of the raiding population. Doesn't that seem somewhat silly to anyone else?? What would be a better comparison of &quot;Accessibility&quot; for Ulduar would be comparing those that completed 10 Man Ulduar to those who have the Yogg'Saron 4 keeper achievement on 10 man. I think you will find that while still lower at the end of the instance it won't be as bad as this appears to make it out. <br />
<br />
Now if you wanted to talk about whether Blizzard is happy to design bosses only accessable to very few then that is fine, but I really don't see what Algalon has to do with anything even remotely connected to an argument of accessibility of content.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Firebert</div><div class="date">2012-02-14, 07:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It wasn't the difficulty of Ulduar that is the golden ratio that needs to be copied to the rest of the game. It was how the raid was set up. How the Storm Peaks set up the massive story line behind Thorim and Hodir. How Freya made an appearance in Sholozar Basin. How we knew that Yogg'Saron was going to be about at the bottom of all this trouble because of breadcrumbs left in Howling Fjord. And where the bosses weren't set up, they were filled with character. Mimiron has by far the best personality for a raid boss whist corrupted, especially during Firefighter. Kologarn was an obvious reference to The Black Knight from Monty Pythin and the Holy Grail. Algalon fitted perfectly with the research of Brann Bronzebeard (Brannbronzan). Razorscale is a she and was Thorim's mount. Nowadays, we have a corrupted Earth giant (origin unknown), two Forgotten Ones (when N'Zoth wasn't set up at all), a Twilight-aligned Shaman (not set up at all), Ultraxion (not set up at all, but makes sense to be a hidden Deathwing creation), and Blackhorn (not set up at all, some random Twilight-aligned Tauren with a drake). The last two fights should have been rolled into one. Even before this: who the hell are the Elemental Council members in Bastion of Twilight? At least Valiona got some breadcrumbing in Grim Batol Heroic, but even then that instance took over two hours to complete (so the breadcrumbing was more difficult to find). Blizzard. When making MoP, at least make bosses that link to the surrounding areas and characters at least. It was the best raid because of this. And Thrall doesn't count.</div></div><hr />

Best part of Ulduar though was the design of the dungeon, the bosses, the set up to the lore behind them, the methods of activating different hard-modes, etc. Gave the place a really enjoyable atmosphere. Compared to end-game content atm, ehhhh.</div></div><hr />

We killed Algalon ranked in the top 100 in 25s and top 50 in 10 man with only 1hr 30 mins of time on him. In comparison to the time spent on the majority of other hard modes he was cake. <br />
<br />
As a high end raider I really enjoyed Ulduar and the way it was designed but I can also see why some people complain about not having access to some of the fights.<br />
<br />
IMO if they had segmented it more like ICC then that would have solved some of the issues as you could have chosen which bosses you wanted to attempt if you didn't have time for a full clear each week. The difficulty level was a very good balance and their was such a good variety of really tough fights that could only be completed after farming gear from the raid and you really noticed every upgrade the raid received.</div></div><hr />

Kaivax made the point that &quot;Ulduar is an example of a raid where lots of players got to enjoy the first few bosses, and very few players ever saw the last few&quot;. This is true but for a very good reason that Kaivax left out for some odd reason. The timeline between 3.1.0 (April 14, 2009 ) to 3.2.0 (August 4, 2009) being released was very short. For such a large instance there really wasn't time for more casual players to finish it. Maybe Blizzard should own up to that instead of blaming the players for having such short exposure to it versus Coliseum and ICC for such long stretches in that expansion that gave players plenty of time to get very far if not finish the content.</div></div><hr />

Okay only a very few amount of players reached the final boss of that tier, but to be honest, does that really matter to players?Every single time the player base states that Ulduar is 1st or 2nd on their personal &quot;Favorite Raid List&quot; Blizzard keeps telling us &quot;Ulduar was ok, but to few people reached the final boss and therefor it was bad&quot;. I don't agree with this. Ulduar was a huge challenge. You could just keep on progressing because of the high amount of bosses and the difficulty linked to it. If you finally managed to kill a specific boss on normal difficulty you could come back a week after and do the same boss on HardMode, which was activated in an interesting way (BIG RED BUTTON!). At the very end you would finally have killed all the bosses on HardMode to unlock Algalon. The Algalon encounter is still one of the most beautiful encounters with the most beautiful envelopment. It's way beter then the content that followed up Ulduar because progress never ends. The same thing goes for the first tier of Cataclysm raiding. There was an amount of 25 progress kills (12 normal 13 heroic bosses). For me in personal as a moderate raider it took about 1 month to kill BoT, I think nearly 3 months to clear BWD and say 2 months to take Al'Akir down on normal. Then we started progressing heroic which I couldn't finish because of IRL, but I think I wouldn't be 13/13HC at the moment of 4.2 got launched.This means never ending progress for those who take raiding serious but don't aim for server / world first / Hard Core raiders. While I am afraid that me and my raiding team are currently at 5/8 Heroic and that it won't take another 4 months to clear 8/8HC. And I don't feel like farming full BiS when the new X-pack is next door!~Taronar</div></div><hr />

<br />
There are a few factors for this. One, yes retention rates (and coming back rates) are higher elsewhere. Of my 10m raidgroup, 6 at least started in vanilla. Ther other 4 in tbc iirc. In my guild overall it's lower and in other guilds on the server the percentages vary probably (the top guild has a large core of IRL friends who started in vanilla). But the other major factor is that people who actually raid a lot, visit forums, keep in touch with the community and actually read up a lot on wow are mostly more veteran players.<br />
The people that joined in wrath and cata simply have not much reason to go looking outside the game, especially the casuals. You notice this with a lot of newer players that they never looked at outside sources of information.</div></div><hr />

No, only 0.38% killed Algalon before ToC came out. Don't most of the guilds downed Algalon while ToC was up or even when ICC was out. (I remember we were still doing Ulduar HM's for realm ranking)</div></div><hr />

Most guilds if not in semi-HC went back to do Yogg zero and Algalon with ToC gear which wasn't a bad thing, Bosses were still hard in ToC gear. <br />

I was very casual and didn't raid until patch 2.4, never getting beyond Karazhan pugs.<br />
<br />
Wrath of the Lich King was my favorite expansion, and still is. I'm not ashamed to type that.<br />
<br />
<br />
This is true but for a very good reason that Kaivax left out for some odd reason. The timeline between 3.1.0 (April 14, 2009 ) to 3.2.0 (August 4, 2009) being released was very short. For such a large instance there really wasn't time for more casual players to finish it. Maybe Blizzard should own up to that instead of blaming the players for having such short exposure to it versus Coliseum and ICC for such long stretches in that expansion that gave players plenty of time to get very far if not finish the content.<br />
They did own up to it. In fact, it was one of the reasons they cited when it was announced that Firelands was going to be released for patch 4.2 instead of 4.1.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I think something is being overlooked here, and that is that ToC came out before a lot of people were done with Ulduar. Ulduar is a huge instance, and lots of guilds (mine included) simply walked away from it when ToC came out, rather than bother to finish it.<br />
It was definitely the case for mine. We only had managed to clear 10&amp;25 N Ulduar up to Hodir when patch 3.2 got released. After that, we only did 10N Ulduar whenever we felt like doing it with a group of our best raiders. Took a long time, but we killed Yogg+4. Never came back there until Cataclysm.<br />
<br />
Sure was a shame. I didn't care for the difficulty (was over-tuned if you ask me), but I loved the lore and surroundings of the place. That's why Ulduar is still my favorite raid to this day.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Numeanor</div><div class="date">2012-02-14, 08:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Why was Ulduar so better than any raid? <br />
Simple:<br />
- It was made properly with a lot of passion and time invested. I remember I was watching videos of game world designing of ulduar without textures few months before it was released. It was a lot of hype in the air and we couldn't wait for it. <br />
- Vehicle combat - yes you might think it was bad, but I liked it. Specially hardmode with 4 towers down. A lot of yelling and coordination on vent but it was EPIC! <br />
- Good boss tactics and almost no class/specc was gimpered in there. Now for exmaple you go BM as hunter in some raids and your pet can't even reach the boss to fight it. So back before you have a lot more choices what specc and combination you want to play, now you have one top specc and one gear and here you go. Back there I remember ew had choice between high crit chance or high armor penetration. Also a lot more choices in talents than now and they will even make it more dumb in MoP. <br />
- Normal modes - hard modes. Normal modes was pretty easy for everyone and everyone could get some gear out of ulduar, hard modes was for better guilds. <br />
- good story<br />
<br />
Today raid: <br />
- poor design, lowest possible amount of work invested - come on a tower from woltk and one dragon model from previous patches, alliance ship and some clouds with recycled models again, a big dragon and some clouds and 4 rocks and one dragon again... I was expecting much much more from blizz, but they let me down... <br />
- small amount of trash - back trash was good to fight specially when there was a need of coordination and a good chance to get some epics as well or at least recipes or rare crafting materials. <br />
-no fun encounters (vehicle or something else)<br />
- bad boss tactics - tank &amp; spank and press one button time to time. Almost no coordination needed anymore. some classes/specc f**ed up by encounters as they can't compete with others - class unbalance (bring mages and rogues and you win). Back in ulduar in our guild we were almost always matched up and almost same DPS from all DPS-ers. About gear: get BiS and you win no other possible combination. <br />
- one difficulty for all or max two ( ulduar has sometimes on some bosses few more steps to harder encounter)<br />
- no story at all. I don't even know why I'm fighting half of the bosses there and defeating last boss feels no epic at all. Just another stupid dragon to kill to get some random crap loot. <br />
<br />
<br />
I agree that raid bosses should be available to everyone because that is why they make it. To people see them and not just few of them (What is a point if they make all models and encounters if people cannot play them???). But they should have more different hard steps (3-5) so people defeating harder modes should get more reward and prestigious things like mounts, titles, gear color, something... <br />
<br />
Blizz need to invest much much more time and people into game not just putting out something that almost I can do myself. Seriously just look how much work was invested into ulduar creation or dragon soul. For ulduar they made a lot new models a whole new world level, new textures, a whole story behind every boss. <br />
Dragons soul feel so blank. Old models seen from previous patches, dumb encounters and no creativity and no story at all except Deathwing.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ZenX</div><div class="date">2012-02-14, 08:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It wasn't the difficulty of Ulduar that is the golden ratio that needs to be copied to the rest of the game. It was how the raid was set up. How the Storm Peaks set up the massive story line behind Thorim and Hodir. How Freya made an appearance in Sholozar Basin. How we knew that Yogg'Saron was going to be about at the bottom of all this trouble because of breadcrumbs left in Howling Fjord. And where the bosses weren't set up, they were filled with character. Mimiron has by far the best personality for a raid boss whist corrupted, especially during Firefighter. Kologarn was an obvious reference to The Black Knight from Monty Pythin and the Holy Grail. Algalon fitted perfectly with the research of Brann Bronzebeard (Brannbronzan). Razorscale is a she and was Thorim's mount. Nowadays, we have a corrupted Earth giant (origin unknown), two Forgotten Ones (when N'Zoth wasn't set up at all), a Twilight-aligned Shaman (not set up at all), Ultraxion (not set up at all, but makes sense to be a hidden Deathwing creation), and Blackhorn (not set up at all, some random Twilight-aligned Tauren with a drake). The last two fights should have been rolled into one. Even before this: who the hell are the Elemental Council members in Bastion of Twilight? At least Valiona got some breadcrumbing in Grim Batol Heroic, but even then that instance took over two hours to complete (so the breadcrumbing was more difficult to find). Blizzard. When making MoP, at least make bosses that link to the surrounding areas and characters at least. It was the best raid because of this. And Thrall doesn't count.<br />
<br />
Ascendant Council: See quests in Vasjh'ir, Deepholm and Twilight Highlands<br />
Mor'chok: As the earth-warder Deathwing is able to bind earth elementals, and in Deepholm we had seen him corrupt Ozruk to his will, and apparently he needed a siege-ram to bulldoze Wyrmrest Temple.<br />
Yor'sahj: See Vasjh'ir and Darkshore(Alliance) \ <br />
Zon'ozz: See Erudax and Vezaxx / These two are faceless lituenants to Old God N'zoth whose related breadcrumbs were laid all over cataclysm zones.<br />
Hagara, Blackthorn: Deathwing was commanding the armies of Old Gods, high-ranking member of Twilight's Hammer trying to stop players on his command.<br />
Ultraxion: Black flight experimenting with every other dragon with Twilight flight being the ultimate result(Except Chromatus) makes this one no surprise.<br />
<br />
The only problem I see was Yor'sahj having the same model with twilight corruptor mobs, with Erudax being used back in Grim Batol and Bastion of Twilight introduced as a first-tier raid, it should have been shipped as the raid tier before Dragon Soul or along with it.<br />
<br />
In addition, Dragon Soul is only relevant when do it having done the complete content of Cataclysm, making it the greatest chain event in WoW.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As for Ulduar, it was difficult, but I was totally okay with that actually. My guild was like 12/12 normal 3/12 heroic when ToC came out like 6 months later. It took us at least 2 months to get all of normal down. For Dragon Soul, we got normal down in 2 weeks. Firelands took 4 weeks, and T11 was a month and a half.<br />
<br />
As Cataclysm has gone on, we've gotten less and less raid content (after you account for difficulty), which is disappointing.<br />
<br />
As she seems to be lying in a pool of her own blood, I'd say it was a val'kyr about to res her after getting owned in Silverpine. Mask is also identical to Val'kyr so yeah.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Like they spend months working on one boss. And if it's so horrible for people to miss out on one boss in a whole expansion then just go play something else. Besides, it is completely acceptable to skip whole tiers but missing out on one boss is not. What a joke. If they wanted people to see the content they 'worked on for months' they would be better of by forcing people to clear all tiers and nerf over time instead of skipping everything and releasing raids on easy difficulty.<br />
<br />
Can't believe that all that matters now is how many people killed X boss. I really thought it was about people having fun and not about how many people killed Algalon. I guess the majority are not casual players but lazy whining players who want everything handed to them. Accessibility has nothing to do with this, you have the gear, there are no artificial barriers, you can just walk in and do it. Accessible =/= easy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Kaivax stipulates that Algalon and Yogg-Saron weren’t killed often because of the length of the raid, not because of them being difficult. Of course, everyone who raided it at the time knew differently (unlike Kaivax, clearly), but there was a good post on these very forums that pointed out the sheer silliness involved in that blue commentary.<br />
<br />
Algalon was meant to be exclusive content for top players, he was designed that way – this means that our intrepid blue poster is making comparisons between things that are not the same. And comparison of Ulduar to any other raid since is close to pointless anyway, due to the fact players had far less time to work on Ulduar by comparison. I can literally guarantee Algalon would have seen more deaths had we gotten eight months out of Ulduar rather than it being cut short for Trial of the Big Round Room.<br />
<br />
Ulduar is now a throwback to a time when raids were designed to be challenging, beautiful, interesting and have a learning curve. Now, “normal modes” are ludicrously easy and LFR isn’t actually raiding at all. At a guess, that’s why Ulduar is so fondly remembered; we’ll never see its like again.<br />
<br />
Oh, yeah, as for actual difficulty; personally, I thought Algalon was a very simple encounter but made huge output demands of everyone and had to be executed perfectly. Essentially, he was a tank-killer (and in the proper sense, not the stupid Gormok one-shot sense) and the encounter was based around that.</div></div><hr />

You have a point to a certain extent, but you need to remember that for a lot of players (myself included) the zone quests were very forgettable.

These days you can hit max level, spend 1 week acquiring gear via AH, JP and VP, and kill the end boss of the expansion the week after that. Quite a change :p Hell, can even do it in 3 days if you rush it a bit (like this guy (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/character/zuljin/Cwitters/simple)). Level 85: 2/08/12. Deathwing kill: 2/11/12<br />
<br />
Best part of Ulduar though was the design of the dungeon, the bosses, the set up to the lore behind them, the methods of activating different hard-modes, etc. Gave the place a really enjoyable atmosphere. Compared to end-game content atm, ehhhh.<br />
<br />
I wonder why people are so afraid about difficulty. Algalon was meant to be there for those that seeked a very difficult encounter. Hell, you had to do half the instance on hard mode to get the key in the first place. <br />
Many people forget that a majority of the players didn’t even take the effort to get that key, but then wonder why only 1% ever saw him. <br />
People are always getting overhyped about things if it appears to be challenging for a change.<br />
A large portion of the player base nominates Ulduar as the best instance so far, and part of that is due to the graph in the news post: it got gradually harder, and you needed at least more than a few resets to clear the instance, and it gave you a feeling of accomplishment when you killed another boss. (If I compare that to Dragon soul, the first instance that we cleared in week 1, with a oneshot on the first boss, and a twoshot on the second, then the comparison needs no further explanation)<br />
It took us 6 weeks to get Yogg-Saron down, and god it felt good when he was dead.<br />
<br />
I wonder why people are so fixated on having to clear an instance when it is current content (with all the dumbing down needed to do so). My first guild is very casual, and only does normal mode to see the content, and guess what, they are clearing Firelands and have fun in doing so, what is wrong with that? While I enjoy heroic DS and the challenges there, the others enjoy Firelands, and they enjoy it as much as I do.<br />
The content is there for everyone, but it is not necessary to clear it on day one.<br />
I guess that is something that the community and Blizzard needs to understand.</div></div><hr />

OT: I started right around when Ulduar came out, so I missed most of the pre-ToC raiding. However, going back and doing Ulduar, especially after the quests was AMAZING. There's so much story going on, you can SEE how Yogg is corrupting things. There's tons of potential hints (like the stained glass in Descent) to be found all over the place. Not to mention the artwork, and the boss fights themselves.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As for Ulduar, it was difficult, but I was totally okay with that actually. My guild was like 12/12 normal 3/12 heroic when ToC came out like 6 months later. It took us at least 2 months to get all of normal down. For Dragon Soul, we got normal down in 2 weeks. Firelands took 4 weeks, and T11 was a month and a half.<br />
<br />
As Cataclysm has gone on, we've gotten less and less raid content (after you account for difficulty), which is disappointing.<br />
<br />
Yes, that's supposed to be Annhylde the Caller, and the image is based off the Leader short story 'Edge of Night' in where, after the defeat of Arthas, Sylvanas throws herself from the top of Icecrown, and the Val'kyr set a pact with her that temporarily keeps Sylvanas from being damned to the same void Arthas was condemned to. I say temporary because the pact bound the life of the original 9 remaining val'kyr to Sylvanas. So long as they live, so does she. So it's just a matter of time before the remaining handful are gone. Annhylde's sacrifice knocked it down to 8. The events in Silverpine lost her 3 more, and the events in Andorhal took at least 1 more. So there remains only 4 of the original 9.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Barnabas</div><div class="date">2012-02-14, 09:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I still see countless of Firelands raids on my realm and have realID friends on numerous other servers who I see there quite often as well. But regardless: Ulduar was claimed to have the best raid of all time (OF ALL TIME!!!!1) by many people, while ToC was considered the worst raid of all time (OF ALL TIME!!!!) by the same people. Would you really raid such a &quot;bad&quot;, &quot;poorly-designed&quot;, &quot;same-room-fight&quot; instance if something &quot;much, much better&quot; was around the corner (in this case, almost literally)? Either a lot of people are lying when they claim Ulduar was great/ToC was a failure, or they were hypocrites for raiding ToC/abandoning Ulduar anyway.<br />
<br />
It doesn't mean shit now though if you kill it for progression. Which is why I asked why do guilds go back when a new tier is in front of them? Sure you see plenty of groups now that quite a few people have finished DS. You didn't see many groups during progression of DS for Firelands though. Even my guild and a few others stopped running firelands after DS. That might have to do with the fact everyone in our raid got their mounts, achieves and legendaries already? I could probably come up with quite a list of excuses of why we don't run firelands currently if I think about it but I won't. <br />
<br />
Firelands has replay value for many of the same reasons that Ulduar does. You are sucked into the storyline during questing and slowly throughout the expansion you are pulled more into the story until you can finally go kill some bosses. TOC doesn't have any of that. You got Ulduar and then surprise a tent is starting to be built in Icecrown or at least that was how I felt about it. There are many more reasons why Ulduar has great replay value that others have already touched on or will if you are still gonna follow this thread. This is my opinion though and obviously others will say something else. Sorry they are wrong.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. To quote Gregory House: &quot;Everybody lies&quot;<br />
<br />
2. Even tend to lie and twist facts when online, even when it does not benefit them. Just human habit after years of being able to pretend to be someone else while online, because it has no repercussions for your personal life, anyway. Whether they are being asked for age-validation on a +18 game website, their gender while chatting or when answering a poll. People are just used to give the most desired answer, because nobody can check if it's true anyway.<br />
<br />
And since it's apparently cool to play this game since the first Alpha, a lot of people will see that as the most desirable answer and select the option, even though it's not even remotely true.</div></div><hr />

Especially considering that we ended up farming ICC for over a year. And if Blizz had done the gear scaling a bit differently instead of making ToC 10 gear better than Yogg+0 10 man gear... Oh well, at least the previous tiers weren't nerfed into the ground back then. But that is for another topic. What I don't understand is how Blizz is afraid to make content for only a small percentage, while they are adding shit to the game only 0,3% of the population seems to understand, like mastery, or reforging. Just look at some random characters on the armory and in most cases the reforging is a mess. People need external help to play this game. There is a serious issue there Blizzard. You can climb all the way from lvl 1 to 85, do 5 man normals, 5 man hc's, LFR even, with spamming just one ability in most cases, without enchants, in the wrong gear, wrong stats (agility mail wearing dodge+dps stat stacking DK's ftl). And then there is this huge gap between that and raiding, even normal modes. And then there is quite a big gap between raiding normal modes and heroic modes, especially on 25's due to the fact that you need to organize a lot more (not saying 10's are easier, just to organize :P). Soooo yeah they need to worry less about who gets to see content and fix the game tbh. /end rant</div></div><hr />

Algalon honestly was not that difficult, the 1 hour timer is what made it tough, compared to Firefighter/Yogg 1, I would easily say that Algalon was easier. You just needed good raid coordination and excellent healers to prevent tank gibs. Firefighter required a hell of a lot more coordination. <br />

it was difficult somewhat at the time to get to him for a lot of guilds, and difficult not having a lot of time to practice... however he was still very difficult, he hit like a truck.</div></div><hr />

<br />
given 3 more months of ulduar, then releasing ToC, i think that chart would look quite different - besides, how many people went back and continued progress in ulduar after clearing ToC? cos i know my guild did. we could clear ToC in 25 minutes and considering the staggered gating of ToC and the 1 boss a week shenanigans blizz pulled, there was A LOT of people still raiding and progressing in ulduar after patch 3.2.<br />
<br />
whilst the ToC gear would've helped a lot of people struggling to progress in ulduar, given a few more weeks in which to progress, a lot of guilds/players would've made it further without it.</div></div><hr />

If everyone were farming Algalon for months before I beat it, the sense of accomplishment would be greatly diminished.<br />

<br />
*enters sarcasm mode* <br />
no let's do it otherwise: let people steamroll through every instance without posing any challenge at all... so that the discussions are not about how difficult a boss is, or how to defeat him, but about the loot he drops (Oh hello LFR!!!!). And so people can whine about how fast they consume content.<br />
/sarcasm off<br />
<br />
There is nothing freaking wrong about something being a challenge. And you can always go back to enjoy that last boss, if it was too dificult at a perticular time. Oh that's right, you didn't know you could go back, because the loot there is then inferior to what you have now, so there is no incentive left to go there, is that about correct?<br />
And before somebody calls me elitist: no I didn't clear Alganon before 3.2 either(simply not enough time), but I did go back to see the encounter, while overgearing it, and I enjoyed killing him. And I did the same thing with LK heroic on L85. And there is nothing wrong with that. I have never complained about Alganon being too hard. The instance was (one of) the best tuned raids so far.</div></div><hr />

<br />
PS: Bosses are supposed to be hard, if people can't kill a certain boss then it's probably not meant to be.<br />
Blizzard is probably gonna put a &quot;x% increase in AP and STA&quot; for all future raids, just like they started with ICC..<br />

WoW used to be fun to raid inn, now it's just.. not fun any more, they've lost the special piece in raids that made them fun.<br />

I started playing this in vanilla, but this is no longer World of Warcraft, it's world of casualcraft, where nothing is really hard or takes time, you just press ctrl+I and get your items.<br />
Really, this game doesn't deserve to live any longer, it died a while back, specifically when they introduced faction transfer and the ability to have multiple faction characters on a PvP realm, shit easy leveling, free tier pieces from heroics (lol what a fail), no resistance involved what so ever, (remember fire res gear farm?) and no epicness left what so ever (Deathwing with no death animation wtf, pathetic), just check out LFR, you can down the most hardcore boss in the entire expansion with 2 clicks of a button and AFK.<br />
If that's not too effing easy I don't know.<br />
<br />
We used to be able to see who was a good PvPr or PvEr by their gear, we're not able to see who's good or bad any more because everyone is pretty much in full set no matter if they dinged 85 yesterday or got realm first 85.<br />

Our guild was 25 man raid but we broke up into 10's to do Ulduar. One of our 10 mans killed Algalon before patch 3.2. My 10 man fizzled because we kept losing tanks and others because of time. It's unfair now because I did it as 85 but Algalon stat is kinda a misleading stat.<br />
<br />
I'm not sayint if they would have held off that the percentage would have jumped like to 50% but the release of TOC just killed Ulduar. 10 man ulduar was easier because of raid lockout and you could blow through most by overpowering it with 25 man gear, which we did as a 25 man. Again my little rant. They released one of the worst raid in TOC (my opinion) and killed on of the better/best.</div></div><hr />

But even though I only raided Algalon alot later I didnt mind, the raid itself was amazing and still had the &quot;Secrets of Ulduar&quot; left inside when they released the trial of the crusader &quot;raids&quot;. You shouldnt have to be entitled to everything, I mean imagine if the raid finder was active for Ulduar.. I probably would have quit right there and then because you gain ZERO sense of accomplishment or that epic feeling when you finally down a boss with your guild after days of trying. Basicly what im saying is, I wish Blizz wouldnt see the fact that not alot of people saw Algalon or Yogg as a bad thing, and stop doing moronic things like raid finders etc where you can literally afk for free loot (which people steal anyway).</div></div><hr />

Actually it's spelled Ulduar. But I digress. ToC was released way too soon. People would easily have gotten another 3-5 months out of Ulduar. <br />
<br />
But as soon as ToC was out, Ulduar was pointless. My guild stopping going there, because the gear from ToC was better and easier to get. <br />
<br />
Never mind the fact that ToC made no sense - why would you send your best champions into an area to die for amusement of others, if the Lich King is looming about just half a zone away? ToC would have been more fun with more depth and a better story (kind of like Ulduar), but as it is, it was a shallow raid. As the leet gear was handed out to anyone and their dog, the GearScore thing started (since ToC required little skill - as a healer, it was a heal-fest and that was all there is to it) - and for me, everything went down the drain after that. <br />
<br />
Make a great raid, and then make it completely pointless after a few months? Shame.</div></div><hr />

You gave up a harder raid with fun, depth and a good story, for an easier one-room raid that hands out loot to everyone who enters?<br />
<br />
I guess your priorities lie with gear, more than experiencing the environment of the raid.<br />
That's not a bad thing at all, but it's quite hypocritical...<br />
<br />
It's like driving an expensive Ferrari, but once a cheaper/faster Mercedes is released, you buy that one and never drive your Ferrari again.<br />
Then when you are in a bar, you complain about everyone how bad the interior of your new car is and how a Ferrari is so much better...<br />
<br />
EDIT: I noticed you wrote &quot;my guild stopped going there&quot;. But that shouldn't be a reason for you to abandon the raid yourself. They don't share a lock-out and you could always PuG Ulduar on your non-raiding days. Since you find ToC to be so easy, clearing it shouldn't have taken you more than one day per week, anyway.</div></div><hr />

Data concerning who killed algalon should be listed along side who killed heroic yogg (1 or 0 light), firefighter and the other more challenging heroics. Comparing it to normal mode ignores where it actually belongs in terms of relative difficulty. The mechanics of the fight might not have offered the challenge that yogg 0 or firefighter had, but the dps requirement coupled with the damage the tanks take is brutal. The fight didn't stand up as well as those others after ToC came out because gearing was able to so directly counter the challenge of it, but while ulduar was current I think you have to compare those who killed it to the other more challenging heroics.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why not put lower ilvl on gear from ToC, but higher than Naxx, move better gear to Ulduar and allow people to easier get enough gear to go Ulduar (and still have reasons, why go there - reasons I mean gear)?<br />
<br />
Instead of this, they put super easy piniata-style raid, with 5 man instance with gear ilvl on hc mode same as normal ulduar, so people:<br />
- Don't have to go to Ulduar, because of better gear in ToC<br />
- Don't have to go to Ulduar, because of easier to get gear in ToC<br />

They made the best raid in the whole WoW history, and - because it was hard (read: challenging), they made new place to hit piniatas, and get better loot, so people DON'T NEED TO GO THERE.</div></div><hr />

Nope, there simply was no reason for your guild to go there anymore. Try persuading a progressing guild to continue progress through Ulduar when ToC gives way better gear, and is easier as well.<br />

<br />
<br />
Like you noticed - my guild stopped going there (I noticed I just quoted another post of yours too ;) ). I was in a progressing guild, and we made very good progress (at our own pace) through Ulduar. But you can't persuade 9 others to continue progress through Ulduar when ToC will give you better gear. <br />
<br />
It was the same for everyone else - at least that's how it felt. Everyone was doing ToC, there seemed to be no interest whatsoever in Ulduar. I would have loved to stay, so no hypocrisy there. The few times people announced a PUG in Trade, I gleefully joined (and having main-healed all encounters up to and including Yogg+4, I dare say I brought the necessary experience to at least clear the instance) - but what really happened was that few people knew what to do, and the rest didn't want to learn. It seemed they expected that Ulduar had to be easy because they were a tier ahead of it, and when the raid inevitably wiped to the first few bosses, it just fell apart.<br />
<br />
When our guild cleared ToC regular, we began progressing through hard mode - so no spare time was set aside for Ulduar. We didn't get through hard mode, so you could say &quot;ToC is hard&quot; in that regard, but it just didn't feel that way either (hence I said ToC is easy) - it felt that the reason we failed were numbers, and nothing else (id est, the boss just hit extremely hard, and we didn't put out the necessary DPS nor the HPS). In Ulduar, on the other hand, I could always see a reason why we wiped - be it getting too many clouds on Yogg because everyone needed to grasp their movement, running over the mines on Mimiron because too much was going on in the final phase - there was so much more to it than numbers.</div></div><hr />

Even casual players vote ulduar high on quality and nostalgia despite not having been able to clear it. I mean here look at it, people didn't clear the raid yet still liked it. Look how few people cleared the whole thing when it was current, yet look at how many people look back on it as one of the best raids put in the game.

<br />
Anyway, I'm confused about some of the responses here. While I'm very much of the opinion that everyone should be able to access the game's content... I thought that's what 10 mans were for. I thought that's why they added the ability to save your raid ID. Content difficulty shouldn't be considered in how &quot;inaccessible&quot; content is.</div></div><hr />

Those who started at any point after Vanilla have been made to feel inferior (regardless of actual skill level) by many of the aforementioned players who so many times in trade chat and other such mediums have made countless efforts to make other players who started playing at any other time to feel less legitimate.

I understand, as a player, that I and everyone else like me wants the difficulty to be represented on a graph like this. But for blizzard, as a company making a game for everyone... literally, this is a bad thing. This is why I thank them for making heroic difficulty dungeons and continuing to make each content release a little bit harder each time. Uld and TOC were good test runs, ICC was too easy, but so far in cata they have tried to make all bosses heroic difficulty hard like Anub/LK but some easier like the others in ICC. Which is good, it makes heroics more progressive and helps the data look as less skewed as possible (including regulars). If I could make one recommendation, it'd have to be fixing 10man dungeons. The difficulty going from 25man to 10man is a joke right now and its no wonder why 25man is dying. A.) its easier to find 10 people, and B.) the difficulty to tuned down, even on heroic mode. <br />
skewed data is skewed ty mr. obvious. All raid content is skewed</div></div><hr />

Sure some might be faking it, but there could be many other factors. For instance, the vanilla players that actually still play could be way more likely than WotLK players to visit MMO Champion, because they take the game more seriously. It could also be that many vanilla players that now quit because of the decline of the game, still visit this site to stay in touch with their former addiction. I started playing in juni '05.

My perspective on the subject is that it is an economical reason. I think that after BC and the Shamanwell plateau (iirc &quot;seen&quot; by less than 2% of WoW population), it became apparent that making such huge instances for such a low playerbase was simply not financially justified. Hence the turnover we saw in WOTLK with an easy initial tier the emergence of HMs for the second, third and fourth tiers.<br />
<br />
A point like &quot;we're investing several millions to make something that almost no players will see&quot; is very hard to defend when significant financial interests are at stake.</div></div><hr />

hm...I play since Vanilla and i know a lot more who play since than. You can see how many have been voted and that is not much even a 100% vanilla player would be possible.

From a raid leader stance, it was easier, no trash, loot was a lot better. But i really hated toc, the pressure of doing the hard modes with just a few or no wipes at all, the need to do the same bosses 4 times every week for each lockout was just dumb. We kept going to ulduar 10 man and when we got the mount was awesome. But algalon was another story, we had like 8 keys in a 10 man group, but everytime someone mentioned algalon, our tank just ninja d'ced, and the morale of the team went down the hill. i killed algalon like in 3.3.5, having the key to access it since 3.2, it was good to kill it before cataclysm. The 1 hour timer had a good lore reason, but for a semi-hardcore group was just too much. If ICC would had ulduar-like hard modes, optional bosses and secondary achievs, it would have been more enjoyable to spend one whole year doing it. also, this. <br />

^ This. They had might as well name it the &quot;Ulduar Standard&quot; because I have seen that term used in other mmo's when they introduce a raid to compare if it is epic or not. So now they are falling back on the excuse of they never made another one because it was too hard huh?<br />

As soon as they released the info on the first fight (Flame Leviathan), I knew it would end up being more of a chore than something fun, and sure enough, by the 3rd-4th run, I was sick of it. Each boss would grow increasingly dull the more you fought them, and when we got to Mimiron (sp?), I had no idea why so many people thought it was a hard fight. It was simple, yet so many people couldn't grasp it. I felt like quitting right around that point.. The only thing I liked about Ulduar was how you triggered Hard mode, you actually had to activate it by doing something to the boss. And yes, I was doing the Molten Bore back in Vanilla. As boring as Ulduar was, MC was worse. I wish I could say the same about BWL and Naxx (I actually enjoyed AQ40), but I was a tank and we were always shouting at each other in Vent when a taunt was resisted/missed.</div></div><hr />

The only vanilla raids I did were Onyxia, and a little ZG and AQ20... all pugging in. In BC I had a regular 10 man group that got Karazhan on farm but could never make it far with ZA, and had a hard time finding people to fill out a 25-man group for Gruul and Magtheridon. Never saw Hyjal or BT till late WotLK, nor Sunwell till Cataclysm. In LK I was a bit harder core--raided with one of the top guilds on my server, ending up doing Ulduar, ToGC, and ICC hard modes. Got my bone drake and rusted proto that way. I always felt like a second-class-citizen in there though, because I never joined their guild, preferring to remain with my friends. This came to a head when they kept me out of the only heroic Lich King kill they did, after they said they were finished raiding till Cataclysm. Didn't even tell me about it, even though I was one of the top dps and showed up for every single raid night. Now, I raid with my friends, and while we may not bulldoze through heroic modes like I did in LK, we have fun together and we're 5/8 normal in Dragon Soul.

<br />
I always assume some people are lying in polls like this, or even topics, mainly because people like to make others think they are better than they are, and there is an odd stigma attached to starting in Wrath and Cata. A lot of people place some value on how long they have been with the game, and I have seen people berate others that started in the later expansions or devalue their opinions &quot;because they havent experienced how the game was&quot; or similar. Wrath and Cata were certainly seen by many as the time wow got &quot;worse&quot; to the point where some people are reluctant to admit they started during those times in case people dont think they've experienced the game properly or something.<br />
<br />
Also I wouldnt be surprised if there was a fair number of people that voted stating they started in Vanilla/BC that dont play any more. Polls in the past have indicated that a fair number of people still come here despite not playing. Hell, you can usually tell, as plenty of people either put it in their sigs, or mention it every other post. I bet most of the people that quit and still come here are the people that started in BC/vanilla.<br />
<br />
Myself, I started about 4 months into vanilla, quit a few months before BC, started again half way through BC, and had a peroid in WotLK where I quit for several months. One of the worst players I know (both in terms of being terrible and a rubbish person) started then. The irony is that he is the first person to call people &quot;Wrath babies&quot; or &quot;Cata-noobs&quot; or something and try and undermine them purely because he has been playing longer.</div></div><hr />

We didn't actually start Ulduar until August. We raided for 2 weeks (Got 4 bosses down) and then stopped so everyone could farm Dungeon emblems (Only 3 of us really did). We started again in September and we killed 1 more boss. By that time TOC got released but we still attempted Ulduar but couldn't down a new boss before I quit the guild due to lack of progression. Most of my Ulduar progression happened after I joined my new guild where we would do Ulduar after we cleared TOC. I still haven't killed Yogg or Council currently.

<br />
Since I guess this is the case for many players, the statistics say that probably more than 50% of the players that stepped into Ulduar killed YS? This is a LOT. And it's a direct counter-argument to what Blizzard is saying, since it shows that the content in Ulduar was very accessible. Despite the instance being very long with a lot bosses.<br />

Well, I doubt this will change their attitude though... would really be nice to have such an epic raid again.</div></div><hr />

Unless all the old timers are still around on this particular site, there is no way that many could have started then. I started during spring 2006 (Vanilla, that is.). From experience, not many people that I socialized and played with during Vanilla, TBC, or even &quot;WotLK&quot; are even around, anymore. I have a really hard time to believe these numbers are correct.<br />
<br />
Why would someone lie in an anonymous poll? Besides, it's pretty well-established that the majority of MMOC users are old school players.<br />
You know what I think? I think you don't want to believe these numbers are correct.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sensa</div><div class="date">2012-02-14, 03:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You gave up a harder raid with fun, depth and a good story, for an easier one-room raid that hands out loot to everyone who enters?<br />
<br />
I guess your priorities lie with gear, more than experiencing the environment of the raid.<br />
That's not a bad thing at all, but it's quite hypocritical...<br />
<br />
It's like driving an expensive Ferrari, but once a cheaper/faster Mercedes is released, you buy that one and never drive your Ferrari again.<br />
Then when you are in a bar, you complain about everyone how bad the interior of your new car is and how a Ferrari is so much better...<br />
<br />
EDIT: I noticed you wrote &quot;my guild stopped going there&quot;. But that shouldn't be a reason for you to abandon the raid yourself. They don't share a lock-out and you could always PuG Ulduar on your non-raiding days. Since you find ToC to be so easy, clearing it shouldn't have taken you more than one day per week, anyway.<br />
<br />
<br />
You've been trolling this entire thread with comments like the above and I can't fathom why. First, the stats presented, no matter how dubious they are, only refer to those who completed Ulduar before ToC came out. What players did or did not do after 3.2 came out is almost totally irrelevant.<br />
<br />
Secondly, you're bashing players for doing exactly what Blizzard wanted them to do....move on to the new and &quot;relevant&quot; content. WoW has been set up like this since almost the beginning.<br />
<br />
If the two instances offered identical rewards you might have a marginally better point but when new content with far superior gear (put there by blizzard to get you to do it) and new achievements etc comes out people naturally gravitate to it regardless of whether or not its as good as the prior raid or not. <br />
<br />
According to your logic all WoW players are hypocrites because they still aren't doing Naxx 1.0.<br />
<br />
Trolling an entire thread to repeatedly made the same stupid point - you must be darn proud of yourself</div></div><hr />

You lost a little respect here.<br />
<br />
You normalize the graph based on how many players completed the first 4 bosses in ulduar. This group of players consists of hardcore raiders, their alts, casual players and your trade pug as ulduar was getting pugged non stop for ages with the bad pug stopping after siege and the better pug going a little further, on average.<br />
<br />
You then compare this to the Algalon that in order to get access to you needed to kill several heroic bosses - and only then did you get 1 hour every week to work on the encounter. It's designed to be done by few, so putting this into this graph to support the notion we should have fewer and/or easier bosses is not something I can sit comfortably with.<br />
<br />
Let's look at it another way.<br />
<br />
88% of all players stepping into ulduar completed more than half the place (8 bosses or so), regardless of their raid mentality. How is that not good?<br />
<br />
More than half of all players completed the harder, later bosses (keepers).<br />
<br />
Only a little under 1/4 completed the final boss, yogg-saron. Now, being the end boss after 10-12 other bosses with complex mechanics compared to most earlier bosses I am actually surprised that if you look at all players that ever completed the first 4 bosses in ulduar 1/4 (including your casual joe that got picked up in trade) would actually kill yogg-saron.<br />
<br />
Nevermind Algalon.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shadeth</div><div class="date">2012-02-14, 04:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I find it ironic that they use Algalon as something most people didn't beat, when Sinestra from Cata is something that not only have most people haven't beat, many people haven't even heard of! Seriously! We were trying to get a group together for it and a lot of nubs were whispering asking what it was. So, they still made inaccessible content, it just wasn't nearly as cool as Ulduar was, that's the problem. Heroic Ruby Sanctum was also probably not cleared by many people when it was current content.<br />
<br />
I think 'optional' super hard bosses are great, let the main player base have a means to clear out most of the storyline through LFR or whatever, but leave some super hard bosses up that take a really dedicated group. Also, the level design for raids has been dumbed down a whole lot since Ulduar, Black Temple, Sunwell, Naxx, BWL, Kara, etc. Those older raids you could almost get lost in if you weren't familiar, the current raids feel like the fight is in the big empty rooms and huge corridors, really boring.</div></div><hr />

Patch 3.2 was rushed out the door very prematurely, and many guilds simply didn't have enough time to finish Ulduar before TOC launched. Ulduar had 14 bosses and was current content for a mere 5 months. I suspect the huge dropoff of Descent into Madness achievements will coincide with the launch date of TOC/TOGC.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">smiff</div><div class="date">2012-02-14, 06:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Keep in mind that Ulduar, a rather large raid instance, was only relevant for approximately 3½ months. That's quite literally NOTHING relative to how much time we've had to clear out other raids, and is likely also one of the conributing factors to its great succes. That goes not to say that it would've been any less epic than what it was if it had remained relevant for a longer period of time. To me (and most probably a few/bunch of other people would concur), soley the content and uniqueness of Ulduar would be compelling enough to keep me attached and entertained for at least twice of its &quot;lifespan&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Eh they are decently hard however I'm looking at the current things in my brain right now<br />
<br />
LFR: Help mode / Basics ( Even though you can ignore 3/4 of the mechanics )<br />
Normal: Easy<br />
Hard: Well... the way it's meant to be played<br />
<br />
Personally I want the uldaur model back, It's great to see a final boss meant for the people who well obviously wanted to see true end game itself. It was very rewarding and just seeing that door to algalon open was amazing in my eyes.</div></div><hr />

They purposely don't mention it because it goes against their argument.</div></div><hr />

Pretty much this. If you think you people have a say in the way the game is designed, quit until they revert. Keep giving your money away to them is accepting the changes they've made.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Last Starfighter</div><div class="date">2012-02-15, 06:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ascendant Council: See quests in Vasjh'ir, Deepholm and Twilight Highlands<br />
Mor'chok: As the earth-warder Deathwing is able to bind earth elementals, and in Deepholm we had seen him corrupt Ozruk to his will, and apparently he needed a siege-ram to bulldoze Wyrmrest Temple.<br />
Yor'sahj: See Vasjh'ir and Darkshore(Alliance) \ <br />
Zon'ozz: See Erudax and Vezaxx / These two are faceless lituenants to Old God N'zoth whose related breadcrumbs were laid all over cataclysm zones.<br />
Hagara, Blackthorn: Deathwing was commanding the armies of Old Gods, high-ranking member of Twilight's Hammer trying to stop players on his command.<br />
Ultraxion: Black flight experimenting with every other dragon with Twilight flight being the ultimate result(Except Chromatus) makes this one no surprise.<br />
<br />
The only problem I see was Yor'sahj having the same model with twilight corruptor mobs, with Erudax being used back in Grim Batol and Bastion of Twilight introduced as a first-tier raid, it should have been shipped as the raid tier before Dragon Soul or along with it.<br />
<br />
In addition, Dragon Soul is only relevant when do it having done the complete content of Cataclysm, making it the greatest chain event in WoW.You're playing the character model game. There is almost no mention of DS raid bosses in any cata questlines. What there are, are similar models, and tiny hints. Nothing more. No breadcrumbs. And deathwing was not commanding the armies of the old gods. Blackhorn? Deathwing's escort. Yor'sahj? Trying to scrape up some more faceless ones for Deathwing. Zon'ozz? At least they tried a little with him. He's a servent of N'zoth. Hagara? Suddenly the first person to learn arcane magic under the forsaken? Got bound to Al'akir, and now all of the sudden she's all about the twilight's hammer after he died?<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong. I really wanted to love Dragon Soul. And I was hyped about it. But they really dropped the ball. If they cared about lore at all, they would have had Chromatus, and The twilight father as raid bosses. Not trying to get the dragon soul from thrall in a 5 man. And all raid chains should only be relevent in the appropriate content. But DS failed miserably as any type of chain. Couldn't touch Ulduar, and not even in the same universe as wrath and ICC.<br />

Ulduar was boring, plain and simple. As soon as they released the info on the first fight (Flame Leviathan), I knew it would end up being more of a chore than something fun, and sure enough, by the 3rd-4th run, I was sick of it. Each boss would grow increasingly dull the more you fought them, and when we got to Mimiron (sp?), I had no idea why so many people thought it was a hard fight. It was simple, yet so many people couldn't grasp it. I felt like quitting right around that point.. The only thing I liked about Ulduar was how you triggered Hard mode, you actually had to activate it by doing something to the boss. And yes, I was doing the Molten Bore back in Vanilla. As boring as Ulduar was, MC was worse. I wish I could say the same about BWL and Naxx (I actually enjoyed AQ40), but I was a tank and we were always shouting at each other in Vent when a taunt was resisted/missed.Lol. Nice try. There's a reason it's hailed as one of wow's greatest raids. And it ain't because it's boring. XD. But to each their own.<br />
<br />
People were sick of Dragon Soul 2 weeks after it was released.</div></div><hr />

They did own up to it. In fact, it was one of the reasons they cited when it was announced that Firelands was going to be released for patch 4.2 instead of 4.1.<br />
<br />
[...] One of our biggest regrets in the pacing of Wrath of the Lich King was the Crusaders' Coliseum. The Trial of the Champion 10- and 25-player raid was released while many raiders were still busy with Ulduar, which meant a premature end to Ulduar raiding -- and a lot of players didn't get a chance to experience all of Ulduar's content during the normal expansion progression.</div></div><hr />

Even if they 'owned' up to it, knowing the fault and then proceeding to use that as your main argument is seriously flawed logic.</div></div><hr />
