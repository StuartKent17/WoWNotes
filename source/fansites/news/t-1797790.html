Patch 6.2 - Apexis Crystal Vendors<br />
We already talked about how the old Apexis Crystal gear will be sold for gold in Patch 6.2 (www.mmo-champion.com/content/4896-Patch-6-2-Apexis-Crystal-Gear-for-Gold-Skip-Mission-Animations-Tweets-Fan-Art), so today we are looking at the new Apexis Crystal vendors. The items that don't increase player power require reputation with the Order of the Awakened (http://ptr.wowdb.com/factions/1849-order-of-the-awakened) faction added in Patch 6.2.<br />
<br />
Baleful armor items cost 5,000 Apexis Crystal (http://ptr.wowdb.com/currencies/823-apexis-crystal) and the Baleful weapons cost 10,000 Apexis Crystal (http://ptr.wowdb.com/currencies/823-apexis-crystal). These same items can be looted from creatures and objects in Tanaan Jungle and some are rewarded from quests. Similar items (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items?filter-search=Baleful&amp;filter-source=16777216) for several slots are also rewarded by some of the Naval Missions. <br />
<br />
These items can then be upgraded to item level 695 with the Empowered Apexis Fragment (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/128225-empowered-apexis-fragment), which costs 20,000 Apexis Crystal (http://ptr.wowdb.com/currencies/823-apexis-crystal). This is higher than Raid Finder gear, which is 675 - 685 and higher than some Normal gear, which is 690 - 705. Players will receive one for free, along with a Baleful Tunic (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/124551-baleful-tunic) for completing part of the Garrison Campaign (http://ptr.wowdb.com/quests/38463-the-cipher-of-damnation) added in Patch 6.2.<br />
<br />
Be sure to cap your Apexis Crystals before Patch 6.2 goes live! This should allow you to have three 695 items on the first day, as the item level 650 Baleful gear is rewarded frequently from drops in Tanaan Jungle. Also keep in mind that the Baleful items can randomly be upgraded to item level 675 upon creation!<br />

Raid Testing Schedule - June 10<br />
We are aiming to get a new build onto the PTR on Tuesday, and will be using Wednesday, June 10, to revisit a couple of Mythic encounters in the new build. As is always the case with PTR raid testing, it is quite possible that there will be technical or gameplay issues that disrupt our plans. Thank you in advance for your patience and understanding.<br />
<br />
Each encounter should be available at approximately the listed times below on all PTR servers.<br />
<br />
Wednesday, June 10<br />
<br />
Kormrok - Mythic Hellfire Citadel - 13:30 PDT (16:30 EDT, 22:30 CEST)<br />
Tyrant Velhari - Mythic Hellfire Citadel - 15:00 PDT (18:00 EDT, 24:00 CEST)<br />
<br />
<br />
As always, this testing schedule is very fluid and subject to the realities of a PTR environment. We might have to change the time of a testing session, change the boss being tested, or cancel a test entirely, due to bugs, server hardware issues, etc. Keep an eye on this forum for the latest information, and thank you in advance for testing and providing feedback.<br />

We're never short on passion, or ideas, or a desire to create more. It really just always comes down to the hours in a day, and how we can best use those hours to achieve the design and content goals we've laid out--a lot of the time working on things so far out that they won't even see a PTR for 6 months to a year.

The 15% elemental damage taken bonus from Hunter T18 Surv 2p: is that from all sources or just the hunter?<br />

Can you please explain the Deadly Throw nerf? What's the point of the talent? The design since inception was ranged interrupt<br />
We felt the ranged interrupt, coupled with the Rogue’s already strong kit of control, was too disruptive. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/606219208557355008))<br />

Character / Items<br />
are there any plans to turn Shard of Archstone (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/86573-shard-of-archstone) into a toy?<br />
Yes! Shard of Archstone will be a toy in a future patch. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/605902969423331328))<br />

You mentioned some time ago you are going to bring back the WotLK arena weapons (season 5-7). Is this still planned?<br />

<br />
if my 91 rogue equips Warglaives in Timewalker dungeon will they be just as good at 70 as they used to be? (Roughly ofc)<br />

<br />
Can the 650 items from tanaan jungle, intended as the catch up mechanic, roll warforged, sockets, and/or tertiary stats?<br />
No, but they can randomly have their quality upgraded when created. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/606176286516469760))<br />
Follow-up for clarity: Quality upgrades are mainly used for outdoor rewards; Warforged/Socket/Tertiary for instance loot. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/606190504712142849))<br />
<br />
PvE<br />
Please consider resetting the leader boards for Challenge Modes. Beating Everbloom top times is impossible after your fix.<br />
We’d probably clear the clearly unattainable times rather than a full board reset, but yes. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/606189421008855041))<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
So Ashran will be just like a random BG? Hope you get good pugs?<br />
Allowing players to form raids/enter Ashran negatively affected instance pop, queue times &amp; faction balance region-wide. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/605903623248224257))<br />

Paul Sams - CEO at Ready At Dawn Studios<br />
It seems Paul Sams left Blizzard back in April and now has now taken on a new challenge as CEO of Ready At Dawn Studios. He shared lessons he learned at Blizzard in an interview with GamesIndustry.biz (http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2015-06-05-blizzards-paul-sams-joins-ready-at-dawn-as-new-ceo) and even stopped by the forum (http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/1797324-Paul-Sams-left-Blizzard-!?p=34264150#post34264150) to provide context on why he left Blizzard. <br />
Q: Blizzard's reputation is second to none in this industry - Paul, what kinds of lessons did you learn there that will help Ready at Dawn reach the next level?<br />
Paul Sams: First and foremost, I learned that you must put game quality and player experience first in everything that you do. Gamers are not driven to buy games because they have a clever business model, they buy games that are fun and immersive that deliver on what was promised. I also learned that being a trend chaser or first mover is not a key to victory. Our team here at Ready At Dawn needs to make games that they love and that they want to play so that we can get the very best and most creative work out of our developers. Force feeding a development team to chase a business model or game type trend when the team doesn't love it is a likely losing proposition. A happy and motivated team that is making a game that they absolutely love with a leadership team that doesn't force them to ship their game before it is ready is part of that formula for success.<br />
<br />
<br />
I am posting to clarify that I have immense loyalty to Blizzard, and it pains me to see my name associated with posts criticizing the company. I would never leave Blizzard unless I fully was confident the company was healthy and well poised for continued success. I have had the privilege of working at Blizzard for nearly 20 years, and Blizzard has given me everything I have in life and taught me everything I know about the video game industry. I even met my wife at Blizzard. Last year, we made the family decision to return to my wife's home state of Texas. It's as simple as that. I want to watch my boys play football, be near my daughter who attends University of Texas and enjoy the great city of Austin. Not only that, I want to be able to support the Denius-Sams Gaming Academy at UT more as well. My opportunity to work with my friends at Ready at Dawn is fortuitous and allows me to continue my work in the industry I love while living in the place I love with the people I love. Not many people get an opportunity to enjoy that trifecta in life. I feel blessed and am fully aware that Blizzard paved this road. The fact that I am proud and excited to now work at Ready at Dawn in no way diminishes my love and respect for my friends and colleagues at Blizzard.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks for the good luck wishes. Just so you know, I can publicly tell you that I 100% support the direction of the company. Again, I left because our entire family wanted to live in my wife's home state of Texas. We have had a home in Austin since 2005 and we spent a ton of time here. We have been planning to move to Austin permanently for years. Our boys wanted to play Texas &quot;Friday Night Lights&quot; football. If you know my family, we are football fanatics and the idea of this pushed our entire family's &quot;geek meter&quot; to 11. There is truly nothing more to the story than what I said in my first post. Good night guys. I hope to see you on Battle.net. <br />

We're never short on passion, or ideas, or a desire to create more. It really just always comes down to the hours in a day, and how we can best use those hours to achieve the design and content goals we've laid out--a lot of the time working on things so far out that they won't even see a PTR for 6 months to a year.

Nothing wrong with those prices to be honest, considering the strength of the gear and how you can pre-farm tokens until you get a piece with desired stats. The new dailies award 2000 Apexis, there are missions that award Apexis (with a new follower to boost it), mage tower gives a steady income and mobs in Tanaan drop them much more frequently than previous level cap mobs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Au contraire. They CAN. There is a bunch of developers that screwed bad with Cataclysm endgame, and thought that doing the same crap, but with more strength, they would have different results.<br />
All they need is to name names. Say who was responsible for the WotLK 12M peak, who was responsible for the constant bleed of Cata, who was responsible for advancing the game (mainly it's systems, things that players don't notice very clearly, but they were GREAT nonetheless) at MoP, and who was responsible for the laziness of WoD (constant &quot;I quit&quot;s because the programming was &quot;so time-consuming&quot;).<br />
Split the rotten band from the quality developers. And let the first be ashamed, because the latter will then have the recognition and power to decide they deserve.<br />

MoP ended, and people still talk ill of Cataclysm. Even the more shy ones, started to complain when they noticed how the devs responsible for that disaster are back commanding WoD development.<br />
Cataclysm wasn't a total loss because the old world revamp. WoD have ONLY the new player models to be proud of, and that's way too little, compared to Cata.</div></div><hr />

I honestly believe that story has a lot more to do with the popularity of expansions than anything else. the thing about Cataclysm and warlords of Draenor is that they both have weak disconnected storylines with lots of plotholes and things that generally make no sense. MoP might not have had the gameplay that people wanted, and it might have introduced a race that was controversial, but it had a far better story until the end, it felt like player actions mattered, and the art was beautiful and didn't make use of overused themes in wow.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Really? Because I remember MoP and Cata were pretty bad too. The early raid content in Mop was cool, but then there were the mists of dailies and Siege of Orcs. for over a year. Or how bout that Amazing lore and villain that was Deathwing, then they ruined it by giving us that tentacle garbage.<br />
<br />
Steady progression downward in creative content starting in BC.<br />
BC was the end all be all of the best content in this game, immersive creative bosses, beautiful tier sets that everybody still loves transmogrifying, amazing art, dungeons, instances and gear progression. Wotlk was pretty good, but not as good as BC. People still enjoyed the lore and ICC was pretty cool, but many of us were not happy with the re-hash of Naxx and the mistake that was ToC. Ulduar and ICC were sick.<br />
<br />
I have high hopes for 6.2's raid tier. The sets have already failed for the most part, some look pretty cool.. but then there are some like the Hunter set, where it's nothing but a rejected MoP leveling set with some sha poop. However, that's what Transmog is for I suppose.<br />
It's the boss fights that need to change, cmon we've been fighting various orcs for the past 3 years. It's about damn time we start seeing some big ass dragons (not that fail deathwing fight), demons, titans, bugs, mechs, anything.<br />
<br />
Unique fights like KT, KJ, Kaelthas, Illidan, Arthas, all of those fights were so epic.<br />
What's SoO/WoD? Fight orc, get out of fire with minor differences. <br />
And deathwing, oh my god the disappointment when I saw that. Why couldn't it be an actual dragon fight like Sapphiron/Sindragosa? Halion? Malygos? Sartharion?! Onyxia even! Nope. Too difficult for blizz. Let's critically wound him and crash him into the ground during a cinematic and then cheese the fight with tentacles.<br />
Still makes me angry to this day, what a waste of an expansion. Deathwing had so much potential as an end boss, and such a massive buildup throughout the expansion.</div></div><hr />

No way. Cataclysm was about rediscovering the World, with the brief interruption of Deepholm. There was a good story there. The atrocious SYSTEMS that made the endgame gameplay a torture that few had conditions to endure was what screwed it.

I think making an Orc-centric xpac after a year of SOO was a mistake, though. <br />

How is recycling Nefarian, Onyxia, and Ragnaros good story? The only original major villain of Cata until Deathwing himself was Cho'gall. Al'akir's involvement was horribly explained at best...and then the fight was terrible, too.<br />
<br />
The story completely flatlined in places (Vashj'ir) and they straight up cut out other things. Where is Neptulon? Etc etc....<br />
<br />
I can't believe people are defending Cata's story. The only reason it isn't worse than WoD's is because it doesn't involve bs timeģdimension travel, one of the worst literary conceits ever</div></div><hr />

Recycling another dragon fight would be too easy you mean? You have some strange standards. Another Dragon fight, joy, such inventiveness. Deathwing fight was pretty spectacular, if it had been just ANOTHER standard Dragon fight, that would've been naff. How exactly would you propose that we fight Deathwing face to face? He's HUGE in lore. I mean raid bosses are big, but Deathwing is massive. We couldn't just tank and spank him, that would be stupid. You might not have liked it(which is fair enough), but to make out like Spine/Madness weren't unique fights is a flat out lie, while actually suggesting that Blizzard should've been lazy and recycle another Dragon fight is puzzling at best.</div></div><hr />

Spine and madness were cool fights.<br />
The problem was that spine HC was way overtuned if you weren't a guild that could stack the appropriate burst classes and needed to wait for debuff to stack.<br />
That in turn delayed you for so long that madness ended up being far easier than spine, which was an anticlimactic end to the expansion.<br />
<br />
We wiped WEEKS on spine and killed madness after the 10th pull or so.</div></div><hr />

Your posts and lack of understanding any literary device and imbecilic thrashing on things such as &quot;rehashing&quot; when you purposely ignored the point of certain events (10th year anniversary Onyxia wasn't intended as she rezzed up) or knowledge of any planar creature not being able to die in the material realm (hence why Ragnaros never died) in said posts when it comes to telling a concise story makes me glad you will never work for Blizzard.</div></div><hr />

Paul Sams: First and foremost, I learned that you must put game quality and player experience first in everything that you do. Gamers are not driven to buy games because they have a clever business model, they buy games that are fun and immersive that deliver on what was promised. I also learned that being a trend chaser or first mover is not a key to victory. Our team here at Ready At Dawn needs to make games that they love and that they want to play so that we can get the very best and most creative work out of our developers. Force feeding a development team to chase a business model or game type trend when the team doesn't love it is a likely losing proposition. A happy and motivated team that is making a game that they absolutely love with a leadership team that doesn't force them to ship their game before it is ready is part of that formula for success.&quot;<br />
<br />
LOL this confirms exactly what players have been accusing blizzard of for the past 3 months. Finally some direct news on why WoD ha been suffering.<br />
<br />
1)&quot;First and foremost, I learned that you must put game quality and player experience first in everything that you do. Gamers are not driven to buy games because they have a clever business model, they buy games that are fun and immersive that deliver on what was promised&quot; -- Players want content in their games, not flashy initial gimmicks that don't hold up. <br />
<br />
2)&quot; I also learned that being a trend chaser or first mover is not a key to victory.&quot;&quot;Force feeding a development team to chase a business model or game type trend when the team doesn't love it is a likely losing proposition.&quot; -- Let the developers do their job and make a fun game the right way, instead of filling it with trash aka farmville, seflies, jukebox, twitter load of crap excuse for content.<br />
<br />
3)&quot;A happy and motivated team that is making a game that they absolutely love with a leadership team that doesn't force them to ship their game before it is ready is part of that formula for success.&quot; -- WoD was an unfinished product that was pushed out by the money grabbing business team way too soon before developers had the chance to produce much of the promised content at bizzcon. Confirmation of players' suspicions.. WoD was rushed and incomplete.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I didn't say recycle another dragon fight. Each of the dragon fights I listed above were unique aside from the two ones where you hide behind iceblocks that I paired together. Halion was really cool with phasing in and out of the shadow realm.<br />
<br />
I dunno man, Onyxia was a pretty big ass dragon, and they made it pretty interactive having her go through phases including flying across the cave breathing fire etc. Deathwing was not that much bigger than Onyxia.<br />
Who's to say that the raiders against Deathwing weren't empowered by the dragon aspects to be able to actually combat the massive dragon?<br />
Shrug... Supremus was a pretty big dude, so was Archi... And all the Pit lords.. etc.<br />
<br />
You are right, deathwing's final encounter was very unique. However, my opinion is that it was an awful encounter and many agree.<br />
At the same time, Blackhand is one of the most challenging end bosses we've ever seen.. but the fight is cancer.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm pretty disappointed with the fight as a whole, especially Phase 2. Really bland mechanics, challenging though they are with the chaos. <br />
<br />
Tho'gar is a masterpiece. H&amp;F is pretty great. Oregorger is unique, if not annoying. But the raid itself is bland. Orcs, fire, metal. <br />
<br />
I think one thing that was nice about Wrath was how well created the raid environments were. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shudder</div><div class="date">2015-06-09, 08:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So they're using the excuse that we have no content cause they're working on content 6 months into the future. THEN WHAT THE FUCK WERE THEY DOING 6 MONTHS AGO?<br />
<br />
Also I spent the last 3 weeks capping 60,000 apexis crystals to start on the mount. Now I see we need to be exalted with some dumb fuck faction TOO? Fuck that shit. What a waste of time.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Buu</div><div class="date">2015-06-10, 11:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">How is recycling Nefarian, Onyxia, and Ragnaros good story? The only original major villain of Cata until Deathwing himself was Cho'gall. Al'akir's involvement was horribly explained at best...and then the fight was terrible, too.<br />
<br />
The story completely flatlined in places (Vashj'ir) and they straight up cut out other things. Where is Neptulon? Etc etc....<br />
<br />
I can't believe people are defending Cata's story. The only reason it isn't worse than WoD's is because it doesn't involve bs timeģdimension travel, one of the worst literary conceits ever<br />
<br />
Wait, WHAT???? Lich king had an ENTIRE RAID REUSED. Not rehashed, not inspired, REUSED. Then we had the King of setbacks, Anu'barak, that successfully dethroned Kael'thas, who earned the title at Burning Crusade. That &quot;they used Ragnaros and the Deathwing Brothers&quot; is the weakest excuse to criticize Cataclysm. They did crap ONLY when they abandoned the Tide Hunter kidnap to advance to the Zandalari plot, to try to fix the mess they did with the launch.<br />
<br />
<br />
Too bad they abandoned the Zandalari heroic dungeons system completely. I loved how DPS were forced to deal with trash and boss mechanics in a strategy level way higher than Tank and Heals. But community decided that DPS should always be the brainless killers...<br />
<br />
BTW Vash'jir flatlined? REALLY??? The only reason I didn't do more Vash'jir with alts was that Hyjal was needed to open Firelands Dailies. I still from time to time get an leveling alt and go play the Naga Memories quest chain, because of how cool it is.<br />
<br />
Cata bled subs because the systems were atrocious; Blizzard abandoned their policy of avoid exploits, and started to endorse it, as long the exploits were made in groups; class-balance was ignored, with most having ONE viable spec, with the other two being useless, up to the LAST patch, when they fixed it; Itemization was made only for Heroic Raid 4-pieces, leaving everyone without a steady and skilled raid group with broken characters.<br />
<br />
But, OK... everything is cool... It was seeing Vic, Ony and Rag that drove people away... Mmmkay...</div></div><hr />
