Patch 6.1 - Mystic Runesaber Mount<br />
Patch 6.1 adds the Mystic Runesaber (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/180545-mystic-runesaber) mount, purchased from the in-game shop. Currently the mount is classified as a ground only mount, which would make it the only purchased mount to be ground only. However, the mount has flying animations and wings, so keep in mind that the content on the PTR can always change!<br />

Blackrock Foundry Frustration<br />
Looking into the data, we've found that the direct damage from Gruul's Inferno Slice in particular was scaling up slightly slower than raid size, when usually our &quot;meteor damage&quot; abilities scale in direct proportion to raid size. As a result, assuming a similar percentage of the total raid splitting the Inferno Slice, it was inflicting more damage per player in smaller raid sizes. We have a hotfix in the works for this issue (keeping the damage unchanged for large raid groups, reducing it for smaller ones), which will likely take effect tomorrow. Thanks for the feedback, which helped direct our attention to this problem. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/361062-blackrock-frustration/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/16283658490?page=1#10))<br />

PTR Build Deployment - 2/6/15<br />
Yea, LOTS of dungeons are broken, I reported a few and they haven't been fixed yet. I think all dungeon boss chests are broken aswell. So many items are currently unobtainable on the ptr, really hope that doesn't go live.<br />
Definitely on our radar. It's not all chests, but it's quite a handful of the &quot;legacy' content chests. Very odd.<br />
<br />
Hey Zor, can you toss out an update please, possibly an ETA or maybe what the new build will consist of?<br />
We're pretty much in the polish phase of builds - these types of builds are there to fix bugs, reduce crashes, improve stability. That kind of thing. Hoping to have realms up within the next couple of hours.<br />
<br />
Windows 8.1<br />
Thanks for the info, we'll take a look. An important part of these builds is using client crashes from you folks, adding fixes, and pushing out new builds that hopefully resolve these crashes. So with that in mind, please send error reports when a crash happens, and do your best to provide information in the comment section.<br />
<br />
You guys do a great job of sending in bug reports and feedback, but crash reports are vitally important as well. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/360957-ptr-build-deployment-2-6-15/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/16202921319?page=2#30))<br />

Do you guys regret hiding passives? Seeing a lot of confusion in-game pertaining to it. Seems less confusing to put them back.<br />
Do they have specific examples? (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/560916306854023168))<br />

Offensive dispels seem to be way too crippling against certain classes, is blizzard aware or concerned about this mechanic?<br />
Many classes have strong counters to other classes. We think that's an important part of classes feeling different. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/560916508583284736))<br />

Frostjaw is currently sharing DR with ROOTS AND SILENCES while it's supposed to share only with silences, bug or intended?<br />
This is intentional as it both roots and silences the target. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/560916611255644160))<br />

why can’t i use glyph of cheetah and glyph of travel at the same time? cheetah’s are SUPPOSED to be fast! wouldn’t affect play<br />
That combo would be fine, but both have to be exclusive with GoStag. Current exclusive glyph design doesn't support that. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/560241537011830784))<br />

Are you satisified with the way crane stance works for MW monks? no fluidity at all to switch between stance, ReM is mandatory<br />
Yes, MW stances are intentionally quite modal and not intended to be frequently swapped. ReM isn't needed for Fistweaving. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/560241553692569600))<br />

PvP<br />
Will the 100 games won achieve for the mount ever be changed please ? Not everyone plays 3's or does rbg 2's with more win maybe<br />
Unlikely as those achievements/mounts were specifically designed to increase participation in 3s and RBGs. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/560916841770401792))<br />

I don't understand people's attitude towards this stuff. It's cosmetic. Having a purple glowing tiger doesn't make you any better at the game, and the time it takes to earn a few bucks at work is probably a LOT less than the time it would take to grind out an achievement.

What part of us paying for an expansion is hard for you to grasp? They charge us for the expansion then charge us monthly. Those mounts we earn in game were already paid for. The store mounts are made using OUR money to pay their employees to make this shit then they turn around and charge us twice. I know you love anal but not all of us do.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That has literally nothing to do with what he commented. He said that Blizzard included 42 mounts in the expansion (yes, an expansion you bought) and people are complaining about one additional one that they are putting in the store. The fact you bought the right to the 42 included in the expansion has nothing to do with his sentiments.</div></div><hr />

Because they're constantly adding cool, unique looking mounts to the store while giving the same recycled crap to us in game, even though the game is still sub based. They're putting the things that look nice in the store and giving us bland reskins and recolours.<br />

<br />
The rylak is just a reskin? I guess you could say most others are, but at least the skins of many of them look better and more detailed than the average mount they put in the game for free. Draenor mounts are mostly just Draenor animals and then they give them to us in different color variations. The store mounts are unique however. They aren't just talbuks in a different color, or elekks in a different color, or wolves in a different color.</div></div><hr />

Its literally the only reason that justifies the kind of defensive attitude I see on here for those in support of an in game store. It seems to be working for Blizz because we live in the instant gratification generation. Its like everyone forgot WoW is a freakin' game. Mounts may be cosmetic, but they're also a statement. A mount could represent your hard work beating a raid...your loyalty to a faction, your determination in PVP. Yes we have those mounts, but in comparison to store mounts, they're a joke. Something Blizzard is doing on purpose. Blizzard IS a business. They will continue producing the kind of content players want. Remember when they tried selling cosmetic gear? There was an uprising and we never saw anything like that again. Im angry that more of us arent fighting to get rid of these store mounts. YES I could buy them...but its the equivalent of buying gold. This is a GAME. I want to earn my gold, earn my mounts, and earn my gear. Why the hell would I want to buy a mount that anyone could get their hands on? Why do these spoiled brats get to look like super stars while the actual gamers get to ride a Hippo with a wonky running animation? Its down right offensive.</div></div><hr />

I am all for Blizzard games and i am usually the last one to comment on them, but asking 15-20 euros for a 10 minute reskin job on a mount is NOT ok when you already charge 15 euros a month for the game itself. Those 15 euros are supposed to grant access to all the content. <br />
&quot;If you don't like it don't buy it&quot;, that's off the point, a mount added to the game is content and should not be gated behind more money in a subscription-based game. If WoW was F2p, it would be ok, but WoW is P2P, so it's NOT ok.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm looking at you Laughing Skull Rep. Grinning reaver was practically made to be your faction mount and they gave it to people with disposable income! Could have given the fae dragon to the Alliance equivalent. Iron Skyreaver coulda been a rad reward or drop somewhere, like last boss in Grimrail or SOMETHING.

I don't understand people's attitude towards this stuff. It's cosmetic. Having a purple glowing tiger doesn't make you any better at the game, and the time it takes to earn a few bucks at work is probably a LOT less than the time it would take to grind out an achievement. But yeah, lets all break out the pitchforks because a company is offering things for money.<br />
<br />
I really don't understand how that makes any difference. Why would you ever want to pay more.<br />
If you think they are offering more you are delusional. And € 20 for a mount is a ridiculous price. <br />
<br />
Why some people think everyone should just accept this is even more mindblowing. And then you call that &quot;breaking out the pitchforks&quot;, get real.</div></div><hr />

Why is it so unreasonable for blizzard to make a mount for the WoW Shope In- Game? Why all the hate? This is a mount everyone gets to have if you are willing to pay 25 Euro for it. If the mount doesn't suit your flavor then you just don't buy it. End of story.<br />

Yeah, the mount costs 25 Euros. Everbody can afford this, but because of different interests / prioritizing that money goes to a greater purpose.<br />
Even if it only is a ground- based mount the fact still stands that the model is pretty damn unique and very good looking. It also is a tiger. A tiger without wings. Sounds pretty reasonable.<br />

There's this stupid misbelief that all F2P games offer nothing but P2W items in their in-game stores and that it's okay to have exclusive vanity items in a subscription based game because they don't give you advantage in the game.<br />
<br />
Newsflash: The majority of F2P/B2P games out there only offer customization/vanity items in their stores WITHOUT charging a subscription fee every month and they seem to be doing fine. Hardly any P2W game survives any more because there's a massive stigma surrounding them.<br />

You want a game, you pay for it.<br />
If it is an online game, you pay for the game and you pay to play on their servers. When you accepted the Terms when installing WoW you gladly accepted the fact that you would be &quot;milked&quot; for money. You are not entitled to play WoW nor pay for the mounts sold at the WoW Shop.<br />
<br />
You say the mounts we earn in game were already paid for. Fair enough. You said that the mounts in the store shop were made using our money. Fair enough. You also say that they use our money to pay their employees to make all of this, turn around and charge us twice. Yes, this is true.<br />

This debate was had over and over since The Retarded Horse. It's hard enough justifying the sub price for the current content, nevermind shelling out additional funds. If you have a F2P model, by all means add as many store mounts as you want. <br />
<br />
If a sub ISNT all inclusive, then you need to stop being arbitrary with it and let people sub to the content they want. Otherwise you're just being a greedy hypocrite. Currently PvP, especially Ashran is wasted on a lot of people, just to name an example. Why dont you use this model? Because the inclusion of of all the content keeps people invested, and that keeps the gears turning and allows things like the server economy and group finder to function. Without the dynamic of people doing different kinds of content, it wouldnt. People would end up losing content they like most, because it doesn't draw enough money.<br />
<br />
I wonder what the differential is of securing subs by making things like this earned ingame and possibly traded, versus the absence of this content and lowering the drive for people to sub. I think the answer might surprise Blizzard, especially at times like this where content is... lacking.</div></div><hr />

You're not entitled to buy anything at all, Shudder, but if you're jealous of people having too much to spend then that's your problem. If you dislike the fact that people like to support something they like, even if that means buying a mount from the WoW Store, then go somewhere else.<br />

It's kinda like Netflix charging a subscription to stream movies, then saying for some movies you need to &quot;pay&quot; to watch it, it begs the question of what the hell a subscription fee is for.<br />

TLDR: All new content added to wow should not be charged as it is already paid for with a subscription fee. Players in the least should be able to earn mounts if they don't want to buy it.</div></div><hr />

Add that to the ridiculous realm/faction/race/name change/mounts/pets/90 boosts and you get a bunch of players frustrated as to why the game feels so empty yet even a single ounce of effort goes into store mounts. <br />
<br />
Right now, if you're not raiding or a serious PvPer in the World of Azeroth, what the hell are you doing? The game lacks meaningful, rewarding solo content that can keep any player engaged for any period of time. As of WoD there are no real grinds that are similar to 'The Bloodthirsty' (250k HKs) or even remotely close to it; Everything is gated. You want to farm Apexis crystals to get better gear? No, wait another day. You want to play around with your Garrison? Better wait on those work orders. You want to gear up your character in BRF but you didn't win any loot? Wait till Wednesday to try again. You want to grind Invincible or Ashes of A'lar? Better get lucky, chances are you're gonna have to wait till Wednesday. I'm not trying to say that things like raids shouldn't reset weekly; My point is that one way or another, 90% of content is gated (especially post-WoD with Garrisons) and it gives players very little to actually work towards outside of their weekly/daily routines. <br />
<br />
These store mounts could be better used to address this issue. They could be used to give players a new quest-chain or a new grind or a new hidden pet/mount to find (See Gaara the hunter pet); If they added small things like this to the game every now and then (I can't imagine it would take that much work), people would have a lot more to do rather than log in, do your daily routine, log out (I'm not saying that this would 'solve' people being bored, but it's a step in the right direction and it shows they're at least bloody trying). But no. Instead, they go for the lazy and/or greedy option and decide to put it on the store, charge a ridiculous price, and soak it all up from you people that actually support this bull crap because you fall for their stupid eye-candy like a 8 year old girl in a pet shop - &quot;OMG IT'S SO PRETTY I HAVE TO HAVE IT&quot;, never thinking for once that if they didn't support this crap then maybe they'd be forced to increase their profit by, I don't know, creating fucking content outside of one raid every 6 months so that people stay subscribed for more than a month (which is more than enough time to do everything).<br />
<br />
And please, to the next person that says &quot;Don't like it, don't buy it&quot; or anything related; Please realize that that argument is never relevant in any situation ever and using it makes you seem just that much more ignorant. It's not about me not liking the content, it's about the effect that the content has on the game; And there's ALWAYS an effect - Whether you see that effect as a positive or negative one is up to you.</div></div><hr />

as for wing animation on the Mystic Runesaber Mount imo is not required for flying, keep in mind there are five jewel crafting panther mounts that can fly and have no wings, the HH horse has no wings either<br />

Let us be honest, the only reason for the wing animation is because passing off another recolor of an existing mount didn't pass the laugh test</div></div><hr />

It's just embarrassing. Not only are most of them recolors of a recolor of a recolor, but half of the models that got reused to hell and back (Seriously, why the hell is a Talbuk the reward for helping the Arakkoa?) have shoddy animations that shouldn't have made it out of beta.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fubukuma</div><div class="date">2015-02-09, 02:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">These store mounts could be better used to address this issue. They could be used to give players a new quest-chain or a new grind or a new hidden pet/mount to find (See Gaara the hunter pet); If they added small things like this to the game every now and then (I can't imagine it would take that much work), people would have a lot more to do rather than log in, do your daily routine, log out (I'm not saying that this would 'solve' people being bored, but it's a step in the right direction and it shows they're at least bloody trying). But no. Instead, they go for the lazy and/or greedy option and decide to put it on the store, charge a ridiculous price, and soak it all up from you people that actually support this bull crap because you fall for their stupid eye-candy like a 8 year old girl in a pet shop - &quot;OMG IT'S SO PRETTY I HAVE TO HAVE IT&quot;, never thinking for once that if they didn't support this crap then maybe they'd be forced to increase their profit by, I don't know, creating fucking content outside of one raid every 6 months so that people stay subscribed for more than a month (which is more than enough time to do everything).<br />
<br />
And please, to the next person that says &quot;Don't like it, don't buy it&quot; or anything related; Please realize that that argument is never relevant in any situation ever and using it makes you seem just that much more ignorant. It's not about me not liking the content, it's about the effect that the content has on the game; And there's ALWAYS an effect - Whether you see that effect as a positive or negative one is up to you.<br />
<br />
This. I can't help but think that we'd be seeing some of those mounts (or at least the effort of making them) somewhere else in the game if Blizzard hadn't figured out that so many players will take it that far up the butt and pay that much extra for something that should be obtainable by actually playing the game (because of the subscription fee).<br />
<br />
To the people who say that it's just pixels and that we should just ignore them if we don't wanna pay: mounts used to be something you earned by doing something special ingame. The fact that you can just pay Blizzard extra money to get these new ones really takes away from the experience of the game. Sure, it's cool for the people who work a lot and don't have that much time to play the game, but in that case I think the argument that it's just pixels and you don't need it actually makes sense. The mounts should be a reward for people who wants to put the extra time and effort into the actual game. <br />
<br />
This is about the future as well. Blizzard will most likely try to push this even further, because they know they can. What's next? Achievements that you can only buy for real life money? I know that's a kinda stupid example since achievements don't give a visual bonus so 95% of players probably wouldn't give a shit about them, but for achievement hunters that'd be the same feeling that we already have with these mounts.</div></div><hr />

It's a video game. We don't need ANY of the pixels. And wow, let's just dismiss all those people as irrelevant. There's lots of awesome mounts I want in-game that I can't get because I don't have the time to get them.

But they are irrelevant. Your logic is &quot;I don't have time to play wow, better pay Blizzard to play wow for me when I can't&quot;<br />
<br />
If you need to pay blizzard for a mount, when any in game mount would work. SIMPLY because it looks cool. It's a bit silly isn't it? Because god knows no one thinks store mounts are cool when they see someone riding them. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wow look at that guy on the sparkle pony, boy do I wish I was him&quot;-Said no one ever<br />
<br />
PS. It isn't an award, awards are generally free.<br />
<br />
You need to delve into why people play wow. Is it the serotonin released when you get that sweet drop, or kill that hard boss? Is it because you want to walk through stormwind decked out in full mythic. Are you just having funsies because you're bored?<br />
<br />
I feel like store mounts don't accomplish any of those. I did get the Bat as a gift. I must say putting in &quot;322323jjk4k2342&quot; wasn't nearly as satisfying as killing Garrosh on Normal during 5.4 after months of pugging, and getting a wolf reskin.</div></div><hr />

They charge that much because they can get away with it, the day it's released we'll see tons of them in Orgrimmar/Stormwind.<br />

If people didn't buy them, Blizzard wouldn't sell them. Even if they would sell more for a cheaper price, they still make more money by keeping it more expensive since it still sells in droves.<br />

We still have no numbers on how many people have left, so claiming they've lost the ones they gained is nonsense until the first quarter call is released.

I think you're exaggerating the &quot;overhype&quot; of WoD by quite a lot, I didn't notice any more hype than usual and I didn't feel let down by the expansion either.

Don't expect people in MMO-Champ to understand economics more than what the news pretends economics is.

Either that or more likely they just thought screw it and thre them into the store instead since they can make a lot of money that way.

<br />
Why is it so unreasonable for blizzard to make a mount for the WoW Shope In- Game? Why all the hate? This is a mount everyone gets to have if you are willing to pay 25 Euro for it. If the mount doesn't suit your flavor then you just don't buy it. End of story.<br />
<br />
Yeah, the mount costs 25 Euros. Everbody can afford this, but because of different interests / prioritizing that money goes to a greater purpose.<br />
Even if it only is a ground- based mount the fact still stands that the model is pretty damn unique and very good looking. It also is a tiger. A tiger without wings. Sounds pretty reasonable.<br />
<br />
In my opinion this mount is worth the money and i will buy it when it goes live! Halleluja!<br />

Who's to say that it's gotten progressively worse? Personally I feel that it's just as bad as it was back then.<br />
<br />
<br />
Neither TB nor Wintergrasp were as hyped as Ashran was, neither were this ambitionous and neither ate up every other PvP content. This is the first expansion with no new battleground or anything else going for it because &quot;We'll bring you Trashcan!&quot;. <br />
<br />
Ate up every other PvP content? All of the PvP content is still relevant, and pretty much always will be. People are still running the same arenas, they are still running Warsong Gulch. PvP doesn't need new areas the way PvE does because the players are what makes or breaks the game.<br />
<br />
As to how hypes Ashran was compared to Wintergrasp and Tol'barad, I would say that it's difficult to say. The biggest reason for me to hate Ashran is because it was meant to be Alterac Valley 2.0, and on that note, they failed so hard it's just ridiculous.<br />

<br />
I don't defend them, but neither can I blame them. Blizzard can do pretty much whatever they want, and only us, the players, can punish them for it by not buying it. The fact remains however, that thousands of people buy these mounts, so clearly a large portion find it to be an ok deal (even if they could get a much better deal if none of them bought it).</div></div><hr />

You're not entitled to buy anything at all, Shudder, but if you're jealous of people having too much to spend then that's your problem. If you dislike the fact that people like to support something they like, even if that means buying a mount from the WoW Store, then go somewhere else.<br />
<br />
And no, i'm not a masochist. I just love the koolaid.<br />
<br />
Jealous? Are you kidding me? Anyone with a computer, a roof over their head, internet and the game plus sub can afford a measly $25 for a mount. I can easily afford it. It's not the point. Why would I buy something in a game? It loses all value if it's not earned. It's like back in the old days when people used gamegenie. What's the point giving yourself unlimited gold or max stats? You didn't earn that, you didn't play the game. You skipped everything. Buying gold and buying mounts and buying transmog gear, it's ridiculous. It's a fucking game, we're supposed to earn stuff in it by wasting our time. <br />
<br />
If the mounts were available to be earned in game and not locked by a third paywall then I wouldn't have an issue. Right now if someone saw this mount and wanted it but didn't play WoW they would have to buy the game, buy the expansion, set up a sub fee THEN buy it from the store. You'd think after spending all that money they'd have access to it and could go about earning it in game. Most rational people that aren't blizzard white knights would think that's just stupid.<br />

This has to be one of the dumbest analogies I've seen. In your little warped mind Walmart ALWAYS gave free action figures when you paid for a movie.

I don't mind the store mounts cause if I want it I can get it and if I don't oh well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, there are some non-store mounts which are ugly. So what? So are some store mounts. Iron Skyreaver looks stupid as ground mount. Heart of the Aspects and Armored Blood wing do not even have a ground animation.<br />
Warforged Nightsmares running animation is pretty &quot;meh&quot;.<br />
<br />
I didn't claim ALL non-store mounts are bad so you can't read to begin with. Futhermore the statement had no relevance to the point I was making. So uh.. maybe instead of trying to be smart and outwit me or whatever you're trying to do I'll help ya understand;<br />
<br />
MOST(read: NOT ALL) of the WoD mounts suck compared to the store mounts, hell they suck compared to the mounts we got in vanilla, bc, wotlk, cata and mop yet they DO put the proper amount of time into making sure the store mounts are awesome and work well - and you think this is ok? I don't.</div></div><hr />

Oh well.<br />
<br />
<br />
But people who get upset over VANITY AND COSMETIC ITEMS being sold in the store, are quite silly honestly... If this gave some sort of advantage in the game, then yeah then you can complain but it literally provides nothing of value other than being a cool and quite frankly, amazing looking mount... Buy it if you want, and save your money if you don't, it's literally that simple.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sure we have a load of mounts added in WoD but the VAST majority are just mobs with saddles stuck on them - there are some really horrendous animation. The likes of this mount and the reaver, (no matter what your aesthetic preference is) are quite clearly better made, far more detailed and of a higher quality than any added for &quot;Free&quot;.<br />
<br />
It's got to the point where its pretty obvious that if their design team comes up with a really nice idea for a mount they'll just save it for the store to get extra cash.</div></div><hr />

I can't believe you're arguing that it takes that much work to make a mount.</div></div><hr />
