<br />
General<br />
<br />
Humans and Orcs are next on the list after dwarves for character model updates.<br />
The Pandaren may also have a dragon turtle mount that will look different from the one obtained through fishing.<br />
The DotA style battleground that got cut is still something that they would like to do, but it needs some new tech that isn't developed yet.<br />
Tri-spec is off the table for the foreseeable future. <br />
There are now eight core buffs, so the UI will show you the number out of eight that you have (6/8).<br />
A new character customization screen is in the works, with a visual list of what the different customizations look like. The screen also has a small video of what the class looks like in action, similar to Diablo III. <br />
Pet battles with World of Warcraft Remote are something that is on the list of things that would be nice to do someday.<br />
The giant statue in Jade Forest will be destroyed when the Alliance and Horde battle, bringing consequences for the entire continent.<br />
The Molten Front daily quests were tuned to take too long.<br />
If titles become account wide, you will be able to use it at the level you could have earned it at.<br />
Mounts are on the list of things to be made account wide, either at launch or a patch soon after.<br />
It still isn't clear if the final version of MoP will raise the guild level cap or not. However, the guild experience caps will be removed. <br />
Green level difficulty and harder quests may give a flat amount of guild experience in order to allow lower level players to contribute to guild leveling.<br />
World PvP may be encouraged by rewards such as raising the Conquest Points cap when .<br />
Before Wrath of the Lich King came out, less than one percent of the playerbase actually experienced Sunwell.<br />
<br />
<br />
Dungeons and Raids<br />
<br />
There is a possibility of another troll dungeon, as some trolls live on an island off the coast of Pandaria.<br />
Blizzard would have liked to do a 15 man raid size if they were starting from scratch today. However, for now they are sticking with both 10 and 25 man.<br />
Raid tiers should last roughly four months, with content updates also coming between the larger raid updates. This could mean we would see a patch every two months or so.<br />
Anger is the Sha world boss in Kun-Lai Summit, appearing every few hours or so. <br />
Fear is a Sha boss in the Dread Wastes, possessing the Mantid Queen and causing havoc. <br />
Each world boss will have a unique mount in their loot table. <br />
Blizzard will be revisiting the shared 10 and 25 man lockout to make sure it is still the right thing.<br />
If you win a roll in LFR and the boss has no item for you, you will get gold instead. <br />
The new LFR loot system will grant a bonus roll when you have an item purchased from one of the Pandaren factions. These tokens can also be used to purchase the normal epic gear that is usually associated with factions. This extra roll works in all three difficulty levels.<br />
<br />
<br />
Classes<br />
<br />
Monks will have autoattack, as gameplay just didn't feel right without it.<br />
Visible librams and quivers may not make it in time for Mists of Pandaria.<br />
Shaman Level 90 talents were in game (http://wow.joystiq.com/2012/03/19/mists-of-pandaria-cool-class-stuff-we-found/)! One improves Unleash Elements to provide a better bonus for each imbue type. The second removes the cooldown on your Fire and Earth Elemental Totems and allows you to control them. The third is a blast of elemental energy in a cone on a 15 sec cooldown.<br />
<br />
<br />
Glyphs<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/iwarlocks.gif Warlock <br />
<br />
Minor glyph that gives Eye of Kilrogg the ability to place your Demonic Circle at the cost of stealth. <br />
Minor glyph that gives felguard with a random two-handed sword, two-handed axe, or polearm when you summon him.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/idruids.gif Druid<br />
<br />
A new minor glyph that allow druids to have a random coloring in cat and bear form has been added. <br />
A new minor glyph that allow druids to stay in tree form has been added. <br />
A new minor glyph that changes a druid's aquatic form into a Orca has been added.<br />
A new minor glyph that changes a druid's travel form into a white stag has been added. Other players can ride you while in this form.<br />
A new minor glyph that changes a druid's moonkin form into a moonkin spirit has been added.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Professions<br />
<br />
Lorewalkers might be worked in to Archaeology somehow, perhaps granting skill ups in some way.<br />
There are now multiple different cooking specializations; steaming, frying, broiling. Each is related to one of the primary stats, like Agility. When you level one of the specializations to 600, you are able to make all of the feasts.<br />
Inscription may get something new, like a staff that you upgrade as you level inscription. This will combat the fatigue that comes from creating hundreds of glyphs to level. <br />
Archaeology may get random creature spawns from digging that will drop more fragments when killed. It also may get a rare drop that will transport you to the next dig site.<br />
<br />
<br />
Lore Figures<br />
<br />
Vol'jin will make an appearance at some point during the expansion.<br />
Blizzard has talked about turning Jaina's hair all white because of the shock, and her becoming this very violent and dangerous mage. <br />
Garrosh has become corrupted and has been doing some really nasty things beneath Orgrimmar.<br />
There may be a Labours of Hercules style quest chain that you do for Varian to show you more of the story and let you get to know him better.<br />
<br />
<br />
A Night in Mists of Pandaria<br />
With all of the great coverage coming out today on the upcoming expansion, we thought it’d be fun to take some of the details we’ve been revealing and relate them in practical terms. One of our main goals in this expansion is making sure that no matter what day of the week it is, and regardless of your experience or progression, that when you log in you can make meaningful progress toward advancing or customizing your character.<br />
<br />
To set the scene for this article: Mists of Pandaria has been released, and as a long-time player I’ve enjoyed exploring all the new high level zones and tackled countless quests. I’ve leveled my character up to 90 and I’m logging in to play for the night. What is there to do?<br />
<br />
<br />
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2012/march/thumb/niMoP01.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2012/march/niMoP01.jpg) <br />
<br />
Acting All Professional-like<br />
<br />
I haven’t hit max on my professions yet, and as an avid cook I’m interested in maxing out each of the new branching trees of cooking specialization. The changes to Archaeology are pretty great so maybe I can mix in some dig sites as I go. I actually got a chance to teleport to a different dig site last night after finding an artifact, which really helped, along with now being able to dig more times at a single site.<br />
<br />
I haven’t worked on Inscription much, but I really love the looks of the staff or wand I can make with the profession. Being able to level my tradeskill all the way to 600 by just working on them doesn’t hurt, either. Of course, I could go hit the cooking, fishing, and archaeology faction dailies and level those professions that way too.<br />
<br />
Factions Speak Louder Than Dungeon Finder<br />
<br />
I should probably work on my factions some more. With the new factions and their currencies I can acquire Craftsman tokens to spend on vanity items like fun toys or pets, and with Elder tokens I can purchase new items, convert them to Valor, or purchase Charms of Good Fortune. The charms actually allow me to “buy” another go at a boss’s loot table (including LFR) once I’ve downed them. I’m really glad the bonus roll loot tables are class specific, so I don’t run the risk of getting an item I can’t use. I do have a chance of just getting gold or some consumables, but it’s not a bad deal since I’m still getting rewarded for working on my factions.<br />
<br />
I’m only Honored with a few so far, and one of my friends hit Revered with Golden Lotus last night so I want to keep up. Exalted is pretty tough to hit and I want to try to be the first in my guild to get one of the new factions maxed out. I can complete dailies to get faction, and even earn more powerful items along the way.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2012/march/thumb/niMoP02.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2012/march/niMoP02.jpg) <br />
<br />
Proving Myself<br />
<br />
I have all of the dungeons and raids at my disposal, and now that all of the raids are supported by the Raid Finder I don’t need to wait for my guild’s raid night to get a shot at some upgrades; plus with some Charms I have a lower probability of experiencing “loot rage” with the option of a second roll. Speaking of loot rage, the change in Raid Finder to per-player loot has made running random raids so much nicer without people fighting over rolls. I really wouldn’t mind running another one tonight.<br />
<br />
With the new Valor system, I can work toward upgrading my current gear by increasing its item level and adding on a few stats at a time. Raid Finder is an option for a little Valor from boss kills, or I could get some more from dungeons, challenges, or scenarios. Regardless of what else I have to do I could be earning Valor and improving my items, which makes scenarios, challenge modes, and dungeons a very appealing option for tonight. If I do make some gear improvements, I’ll probably want to hit the new Proving Grounds. They’re like lored-up solo instances that make trying out my rotations a lot more fun since I can chase achievements.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2012/march/thumb/niMoP03.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2012/march/niMoP03.jpg) <br />
<br />
Oh, You Fancy, Huh?<br />
<br />
So maybe I’ll work on getting some item upgrades from dungeons, raids, or faction rewards, or I can improve my current item levels with Valor earned from challenge modes, scenarios, dungeons, and Raid Finder. I’m not ashamed to say I’m kind of geeked up over the new Pet Battle system. I wasn’t a very avid pet collector before, but after battling some of my friends (and seeing how much some of the trained pets sell for on the auction house) my interest has definitely skyrocketed.<br />
<br />
But you know, I’ve seen some people strutting around with new transmog items, and I’m thinking it’s time I start looking a bit fancier. I have a few friends on and we can use dungeon finder to fill out a challenge mode run, which is where the coolest looking transmogrification set (IMO) for my class comes from. I just need another medal in Gate of the Setting Sun and I’ll be able to get the boots, and then move on to the chest piece. It’s pretty easy to build a group too since none of us really need to be chasing the same medals, as long as we hit them we’ll be able to make progress toward some rewards. The ultimate prize for completing all the challenges is a mount, of course, and although I’m still a ways off from that it’s a good goal to shoot for.<br />
<br />
Rogue Sappin' My Totem<br />
<br />
Those are some ideas, but I’ve really been getting back into PvP lately. With some of the changes it’s pretty enticing to get out into the world and mix it up. By accomplishing some of the outdoor PvP quests and objectives I can actually raise my weekly Conquest cap, which means I can build my PvP set that much faster. I’ve flown over some pretty intense looking outdoor battles, and I can’t help myself as I jump in and work toward increasing my cap for the week. Plus, with the change from Resilience to two new stats and the accompanying item budget changes, the PvE gear I’m wearing isn’t totally awful if I do want to jump in (or get jumped while trying to work on my dailies). Once I start getting more PvP gear I also won’t be totally awful if I decide to hop into a dungeon.<br />
<br />
I’m still working toward a set of PvP and PvE gear, but it’s nice to be able to work on what I want and not be completely underpowered if I change my mind or want to dip my toe into one or the other. The other two people from my 3v3 team are online, and we should probably group up and go see about increasing our caps. Once I increase my cap I definitely want to get back into one of the new objective-oriented Battlegrounds. Protecting and pushing a mine cart as you fight off attackers in Silvershard Mines is a ton of fun, and the Murderball-esque Temple of Kotmogu is super intense.<br />
<br />
One More Thing...<br />
<br />
Well, I clearly have a lot of options for tonight. I almost forgot about finding some of the new mounts that are hidden around Pandaria; cultivating my garden and earning faction with the Tillers; caring for, hatching, training and eventually riding my own cloud serpent mount; building my historical library with the Lorewalker faction; and advancing my progress in the persistent sacred Vale of Eternal Blossoms by driving the Mogu out. There’s clearly no shortage of things to do at the level cap.<br />
<br />
So what should I do tonight?<br />
<br />
<br />

MoP Beta Release Date<br />
We haven't announced beta for Mists of Pandaria as of yet. We'll do our best to keep everyone informed however. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/219169-mop-beta/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/4217173574#15))<br />
<br />
DoTA Style Battleground<br />
Cory Stockton addressed this during the press event. We stated at BlizzCon we had three map ideas we were considering, but the plan was always to choose two for the initial launch of the expansion. The DotA-style map was the one we decided not to run with for launch. It's still a Battleground gameplay style we'd like to do during the Mists of Pandaria life cycle. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/219212-what-happened-to-the-dota-styled-bg/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/4217204174#13))<br />
<br />
No Squish or New Player Models?<br />
First, we will have to see how things go. If things need a look at (squish wise) we'll look at them, as always. It's too soon to know how this will play out, but I think Ghostcrawler has explained a bit about the thoughts on this in a previous blog post (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/blog/3885585).<br />
<br />
WoW Insider also does a good job of explaining a bit more about this topic that perhaps make this not the issue it was before.<br />
<br />
Rather than compressing item levels and retuning seven years' worth of content, the developers appear to have opted to go with the concept of Mega Damage, replacing a bunch of spare 0s with a K or an M where appropriate. When killing mobs in Pandaria, my four-digit damage was not compressed. If I hit something for 3,000 damage, it displayed as 3,000 damage. However, five-digit numbers and higher were compressed. 30,000 became 30K. It's a very simple solution and should have very little impact on your gameplay overall.<br />
<br />
We'll be keeping an eye on things however.<br />
<br />
Second, we are working to update character models, but this isn't an easy undertaking. As you may have seen already, there has been a lot of work done to get Mists of Pandaria this far (from BlizzCon) and I'd hope that everyone can see that the developers have been very hard at work getting us here. Character models aren't something you can do overnight and make them stack up to the expectations of what that means. We want to make sure (like everything we do) that we do our best to get it right.<br />
<br />
There's a lot of information out in the wild right now that we are working to gather for you all, and understanding the concerns or questions people have after seeing all of that will help us to provide more insights or answers where needed. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/219169-mop-beta/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/4217173574#15))<br />
<br />
Garrosh Spoilers<br />
We run into a couple problems with the idea of keeping this a secret. As you mentioned, everyone knew who the end bosses were for the previous expansions. This set an expectation for each one. You could argue that this had to be done since the storyline was largely based on getting to that end boss and killing them.<br />
<br />
But, either we don't say anything now and expectations go a different direction than we intend, or we tell people and &quot;spoil&quot; it. There's not going to be that same direct path to an end boss (at least initially) to get people prepared the same way as you were for Arthas or Illidan, or Deathwing. That said though, I don't think that, in the end, we're spoiling anything.<br />
<br />
The news is out there now and we can focus first and foremost on getting to Pandaria and exploring it (while killing new and exotic creatures) and secondly, we can get right to the real enemy (war itself) after we've run amok there and caused all kinds of havoc with what should have remained a relatively tranquil place in the world. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/219167-spoilers-too-soon/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/4216983499#18))<br />
<br />
Female Pandaren Model<br />
I'm going to attempt to nip &quot;complaints&quot; in the bud a bit. First I'll link you to WoW Insider's write up about what they saw so that it's not just my word about how great this model looks- Go here (http://wow.joystiq.com/2012/03/19/mists-of-pandaria-female-pandaren/) to read.<br />
<br />
Next, I'm going to simply say that what you are seeing is a small sample of what this character looks like. You have a choice of the red version (with long tail) or the more traditional pandaren style with the stub tail. She has many amazing new hairstyles you will get to see as well as many choices for her face and features. On top of this, this model looks amazing in motion.<br />
<br />
I don't want to squash any discussions, because I think constructive feedback is always valuable, but we're pretty happy with how she came out and from what I've seen so far, a large portion of the community is as well. When you all get to see her within the game, we can talk some more if you still have some concerns. Again, I'm not trying to be dismissive, but seeing the character in motion with all of her options may well change this whole conversation you're trying to start up. <br />
<br />
Don't get too caught up on getting nitty gritty with feature choices/facial choices, but there are a good amount to choose from. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/219165-female-pandaren-model-complaints/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/4217173454?page=3#44))<br />
<br />
Player Model Update<br />
Considering the female panda looks awful I'm not looking forward to this.<br />
This is a perfect example of why we have to be super careful with updating the models. People have vastly different opinions on what looks good and what doesn't.<br />
<br />
Some people will no doubt love any upgrades we make to the models — others may not. When something you see on your screen all the time, something you may have been looking at for years and are perfectly happy with, suddenly gets changed, it may not be a welcome change for everyone. So we're not rushing it. Also, these model updates require the work of our very best artists, and those guys aren't exactly sitting twiddling their thumbs right now. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/219170-no-new-race-models-problem/) / Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/3523213163?page=3#44))<br />
<br />
New LFR Loot System<br />
First, other players will not affect your loot in any way. Another player winning will not cause you to lose. Another player winning a mace will not mean that she took your mace. If there are many rogues in the raid, your chance of winning a rogue item is not diminished. We may decide that each player has an X% chance to get loot, or we may decide that X number of players get loot, and then randomly determine who those lucky players are.<br />
<br />
Second, the item you win will be “useful” in the sense that it’s potentially usable by your current spec. This does not mean that warriors will get leather because warriors can equip leather (at a huge stat loss). It also does not mean that the game will always give you an item you want or an upgrade for the items you have. It just looks and says “You are a Holy priest, so here is a random item chosen from the Holy priest-appropriate items that this boss can drop.”<br />
<br />
This system is a different feature from the “bonus roll.” When choosing to cash in on your bonus roll, you will always win something, but it may only be gold. If you win an item, the game again looks at your spec and only awards you an item appropriate for your current spec (using the priest example above).<br />
<br />
Finally, this loot system will only be used in Raid Finder, and possibly for world bosses. We might consider using it for Dungeon Finder depending on how it works out. However, we still like the basic design of organized groups of guilds or friends deciding who should get loot. We will also no doubt iterate and refine the system once players can try it out in beta. <br />
<br />
This sounds far too complicated for the average player.<br />
That isn’t our intent. We’re providing details here because players want to understand them. In the game, the experience will just be “You won this.” You will either be happy because it’s an item or really happy because it’s a big upgrade for you. You may be jealous of other players who won great items, but you hopefully won’t hate them since they didn’t take an item away from you.<br />
<br />
The main reason that they need to &quot;fix&quot; the way loot is gained is because people are too greedy/stupid and roll need on things they don't really need.<br />
There’s probably some of that, but overall it’s not strictly a problem of players being malicious or uninformed. Raid Finder just feels different from a normal or heroic raid. The experience a lot of us have in Raid Finder is an item pops up, but the raid may already be pulling the next boss, and there isn’t time or inclination to sit down and discuss who should get the item, so you just hit Need if the game lets you. Often times you don’t even realize which items you won until the run is over. We think Raid Finder is a streamlined way to raid so it needs a more streamlined loot system. Reducing loot drama among strangers isn’t a bad goal either, but it wasn’t our only concern.<br />
<br />
Can that system at least be used to have a boss not drop rogue items for a group that has no rogue...<br />
Perhaps, but our concern was that if players have too much control over what loot dropped, it invites a lot of group engineering. You might be able to force the game to drop druid items if you formed a raid of nothing but druids. Both Valor Points and the new bonus roll design are intended to partially offset the potential for just having really bad luck. <br />
<br />
Say Souldrinker, Bob wins it this week, is it possible for the loot system to give it to him again next week if he wins his roll?<br />
The new system won't have a record of your loot history or check your inventory. In your example, Bob might win the same item off of the boss every week (assuming he's running as the same spec each time).<br />
<br />
The only thing the system looks at is 1) if you are eligible for loot (have you killed this guy already this week?), and 2) what your current spec is.<br />
<br />
Before this I would try and keep an eye out for good items for my off-spec assuming no one else needed the item in the group. When you do the same instance several times you're bound to get a tank that already has that item and so on<br />
Ideally, you would gear up through dungeons or other sources of loot and enter as main spec. One of the sources of current loot frustration is when a player who isn’t in a role earns gear for that role. We also don’t want to give DPS players a bunch of tanking items that they don’t want. In Mists, the one way you can communicate to the game what gear you want is through the role you're filling in the raid.<br />
<br />
We're confident there are enough alternate means to obtain viable loot for your off spec in Mists that you'll be adequately equipped to perform in that role when you want to. <br />
<br />
So you can win the same item over and over? Doesn't this seem like a waste of loot?<br />
Loot gets wasted today if someone needs it who already has it (probably because they need everything), or if the game just keeps dropping the same stuff over and over. Some amount of loot wastage is okay -- we don't actually want loot accrual to be too efficient or players finish the content too quickly. On the other hand, we don't want it to be so frustrating that players give up. Slot machines need to pay off once in awhile, but not every time. <br />
<br />
There seems to be a fair amount of confusion about this system, so let me clarify some of what I'm seeing. Before jumping into it, just know we have plans to do a developer blog on Mists of Pandaria looting soon. We'd like to cover some of the larger questions/concerns in a more visible way, rather than further burying them in responses here.<br />
<br />
Will the items that we win be trade-able?<br />
You can’t trade loot if the game assigns it to you in LFR. That would defeat the whole purpose. Imagine it works like completing a quest – here is your personal, soulbound reward. If you enter with a full pre-made group, then you can use Master Looter or the loot system of your choice (just like today) and can trade items as normal.<br />
<br />
You have a personal slot machine to play, and so do each of the other 24 raid members, and no ones personal slot machine affects the outcome of anyone ELSE'S slot machine.<br />
This is correct. The only reason I offered that the game might decide how many players get loot in advance, is we thought it might be weird if sometimes 25 players or 0 players got loot -- that might feel broken to participants. However, for the sake of argument, just assume that other players won’t affect your loot. That is the whole point. It won’t matter whether you killed the boss with 1 player or 25 players, and it won’t matter what the spec or class is of those players. The loot is per person and not per raid.<br />
<br />
If you are in a 25-player group, can people &quot;pass&quot; and increase the chance that other players will win, by reducing the number of people rolling in the group?<br />
No. There is no concept of rolling in today’s sense (again, only when using this particular LFR looting system). A boss dies and the game says “You won this,” and gives the item to you… hopefully with a little more ceremony than that. <br />
<br />
What's going to happen with bows?<br />
In Mists of Pandaria, bows, crossbows and guns would be considered hunter-appropriate weapons. In LFR, a rogue or warrior would never be offered a bow as a loot reward. Rogues and warriors will still be able to equip ranged weapons, but they would be very sub-optimal for doing so (sort of the equivalent of a warrior wearing cloth). We left the ability to equip weapons for role-playing reasons and because some existing rogues and warriors have epic or legendary ranged weapons, and it would be mean if they could no longer equip them at all.<br />
<br />
Everyone rolls - after everyone rolls, the top rollers will be eligible for loot - the boss then releases its random loot and whoever the top rollers are (who are able to use the items) wins the item<br />
The new system is more different than that. Players aren’t asked to roll. The game just “makes the roll” behind the scenes. The game then picks appropriate loot for each of the winners. This is an important distinction because you aren’t competing with other players for specific items – all of the Arms and Fury warriors could win the two-handed Strength sword, or two could win the sword and the third could win a plate Strength helm, if that were also on the boss loot table.<br />
<br />
Can't you guys just make the obvious: Make all the drop items unique?<br />
Sure, we could do that, but it seems like all you are really asking for is for the loot system to be more efficient so that you have to run the raid fewer times to get the items you want (since you won’t “waste” a roll on a duplicate item). If we need for raiding to be more loot-efficient, there are many ways to do that, but we don’t want players to gear up too quickly or they run out of things to do. (We also don’t want them to gear up so slowly that they could lose interest.) Also consider that some players may want more than one copy of the same item for different spec or gemming purposes.<br />
<br />
This still doesn't really address the problem of people rolling when they really don't need anything. What if those top 4 or 5 rollers all don't need anything off the boss and just receive gold? Completely unfair to the other 20 people who could have made use of the boss drops.<br />
There is no roll like you are describing. A boss dies, and some players in the game will receive loot. They don’t have an option to pass or to get gold instead. But that’s okay, because what they do won’t affect what happens to you. Imagine everyone entering the raid gets a lottery scratch off card for each boss, and after a boss dies, everyone scratches off a card. Some players win. Some don’t. The game then pushes loot to the winners. Then you kill the next boss and scratch off another card.<br />
<br />
I don't have a problem with someone winning a role if they can use the item even if it is offspec. I just don't like people being inconsiderate and rolling need when they don't need it or already have it.<br />
We don’t think it’s reasonable to expect a group of strangers who may never play together again to be considerate, especially at the pace at which most Raid Finder groups progress. Often, there is barely time to hit Need or Pass, let alone have a discussion about who gets what loot. The goal of the system isn’t really to be “more fair,” but to make a more streamlined system to match the fast pace of Raid Finder, and to cut down on the number of arguments over loot, because the game will now be making all the decisions about who gets which item instead of the players. Life may still feel unfair sometimes, in that a player who contributed less than you wins a good item, or the player running the raid for the first time gets an item that you spent weeks to get, or someone may have six trinkets to your one. We still want random loot to be random, though the bonus roll system will help a little with being terminally unlucky.

Normally when you are under extreme stress your hair starts going white, and Jaina will be under more then that. I expect she will go batshit insane with the destruction of Theramore.</div></div><hr />

<br />
well in ragefire chasm the burning blade was in there for something. if it just to summon a felgaurd i was like wtf thats a waste of time. pluss outside of org near the harbor the burning blade was really pushing back the orc solders from entering inside the cave. if the burning blade cult are going to be a major enemy group in MoP we mgith deal with them on pandaria too. they were planning on summoning something worst maybe and when garrosh went down and try to stop it he got possessed or corrpted by it. when we fight him dont think we will kill him but same as in wc3 with grom. weaken him and do the same with the soulstone to calm him and free him. so far we have to wait and see whats going on with garrosh.</div></div><hr />

<br />
if theramore destroyed pissed yes but raging piss off no unless if it like genocide where the horde solders slaughter everyone including innocent civilians. i know thrall will try to stop this and calm her down. lets just hope she doesn't turn evil like the archbishop if yess then i quit wo for sure cause kaina is one the oldest and well known characters in the lore. plus dont like the idea of her hair turning white. least change clothes but dont change hair color.<br />

<br />
Which questionable leader doesn't nowadays... Sylvanas has some oooh-so-scary stuff going below Undercity too. I'm pretty sure Varian has a secret stash of his statues lying under Stormwind and he's doing 'nasty things' with them. Hell, dig under Silvermoon and you'll probably find a super secret hair saloon or something. <br />

<br />
<br />
I am concerned about the whole LFR thought process they are taking. Streamline the whole raiding process, and now streamlining the whole damned loot system? It sounds like instead of 4 loots dropping, 25 people could potentially get loot per boss. If I'm reading it correctly. It just sounds too much like another free hand out. Well, here you go, you kind of participated in an easy raid, where you pretty much just have to show up for an hour....<br />
<br />
<br />
I feel like they could have gone a much better route if their goal was to streamline it, or prevent people from pulling the next boss before loot goes out,....</div></div><hr />

Just because you disagree with it doesn't make it wrong. They may not always make the content that everyone wants them to make, but they usually put a lot of work into what they do put out.<br />

Those are the two professions I enjoy and feel most passionate about. Having shoulder enchants as the only special perk for inscription just doesn't cut it for me, as great as those enchants are. My greatest dislike about the Cataclysm expansion wasn't only the lack of raid tiers (there really should have been another one in 4.1), but mainly how long it took for new content to be released. I quit playing World of Warcraft for about 8 months because of the lack of new content and the game losing its freshness as a result.

Streamline the whole raiding process, and now streamlining the whole damned loot system? It sounds like instead of 4 loots dropping, 25 people could potentially get loot per boss. If I'm reading it correctly. It just sounds too much like another free hand out. Well, here you go, you kind of participated in an easy raid, where you pretty much just have to show up for an hour....<br />
<br />
<br />
I feel like they could have gone a much better route if their goal was to streamline it, or prevent people from pulling the next boss before loot goes out,....<br />
<br />
Think you did understand it wrong... The system is like this... at the start of a raid the game already decide how the loot will be split but what determines the final outcome is the roll.. Say they are 5 rogues in the group and the boss has 3 items that can be roll on by the 5rogues... it will look @ the roll amount all rogues did and the look @ which one of the 3 items is best suited for base on spec.. So which ever rogue rolled the highest if there is a loot that match his spec he gets the item if there is none he get gold or he has a low chance of getting one the the items that doesn't really help him much but can be used by rogues, but that only comes into player have the system distribute the loot to the other 2rogues who the items are upgrade for them..<br />
<br />
As he said winning a roll doesn't always net you the loot of your desire, in other words they have implemented some randomness in loot distribution on top of the rolling mechanic.. Also remember you can't trade loot in LFR no more like you can now..</div></div><hr />

This could potentially lead into troubles, but I'm fairly certain they balance the loot handling in a manner that the we get approximately the same amount of loot as those raiding in traditional groups (Normal/Heroic).<br />
<br />
However, you are correct in stating that in best case scenario, all 25 people in your 25-man group will get a loot in a single boss fight. In the end, this is extremely unlikely but a possibility. (Consider this as &quot;a lottery win&quot;)</div></div><hr />

You can raise your own over the course of roughly 20 days.<br />

That is actually incorrect.<br />
<br />
Here is how it actually goes.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
You will only be rolling against yourself.<br />
The bosses will have randomized loot for every single kill (Internal Loot - which you will not be able to see). Every time you kill a boss there's a chance of it dropping a certain item.<br />
This means that every time you kill a raid boss that rewards loot, game will automatically roll for you (This is also done internally).<br />
If you win the roll &amp; the boss has loot that you can put to use, you will get that loot.<br />
If you win the roll &amp; the boss does not have a loot for you, you will get gold instead.<br />
If you lose the roll you obviously get nothing.<br />
There is a possibility for &quot;a bonus&quot; roll using an item purchased from one of the Pandaren factions. This is &quot;an extra&quot; roll if you did not to win the loot with your first roll.</div></div><hr />

It's not like you'll start MoP and the game is like &quot;hey, Jaina's hair is white now and Garrosh must die!&quot;. This will be the end situation of quest progress trough several content patches. The equivalent of deathwing.<br />

Jaina with a white hair? Why? I'm sure she can be a badass mage without change the hair color...What's next? King Varian explode in rage and his hair became yeallow? ¬¬<br />

The cloud serpent is their &quot;racial&quot; mount if I'm not mistaken.<br />

The turtle mount will be most likely be more like an obtainable mount.<br />

Not to be rude, but you sound like a big baby. Casuals make up a majority of the subs and majority wins. Gone are the days of BC when 99% of people sat around jealous of the 1% of people that had sweet gear. And WoW has been &quot;casual&quot; since Wrath, so I'm not sure why you're so surprised. <br />
<br />
There will still be hard modes for you and don't forget the challenge dungeons. I'm sure a gold medal for every dungeon is going to be pretty damn tough for some time. There will be a lot to do. Stop focusing on rewards and gear and maybe just focus on having fun?</div></div><hr />

The fact is that even now you can easily AFK the whole fight and come back to roll for the rewards. This loot system does not change that, but it was never meant to do so. The whole point of it is to address the issue of &quot;just rolling need on everything&quot; and above that, to actually improve your chances of getting loot (especially if you are very unlucky like me).<br />
<br />
There are also challenge modes that offer unique rewards and obviously Normal &amp; Heroic difficulties for more hardcore players to detach themselves from the casuals. I can't deny that they've simplified some things over the course of WoW development, but to call it &quot;overly casual&quot; doesn't sound right to me either.</div></div><hr />

Here is the problem. If you have a job paying 20 dollars an hour making a car, and you have to make 10 cars a day, then you find out a guy on the next line is making 20 dollars an hour, but only has to make 5 cars a day, wouldn't you be mad?<br />
<br />
Another more serious thing is how FAR the game has gone &quot;casual&quot;... history says if they follow that path, and keep following it, how EASY will this game become?

Don't bother, the only thing that satisfies these kind of posters are apparently raids which .1 of the WoW playerbase even gets into. Makes them feel special :) luckily most people, including Blizzard, knows this is a waste of development.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Easy - you don't roll at all.<br />
<br />
If a boss dies in the lfr, the system behind does an automatic &quot;who did win&quot; roll - you won't have the need/greed/pass box anymore. Lets say 4 ppl win this out of 25. Those 4 ppl get a class/spec specific item from the boss loot table (random). I guess there will be a new box with the option to get gold or the item displayed you actually won. So you can decide, if you want the item or the gold (because you already have the item etc.)</div></div><hr />

No it won't, and in case you haven't noticed, what you call casual is to make content that is for everyone, but still always reward dedicated players with more rewards.<br />
<br />
Maybe you don't even do hardmodes, then feel pissed because your normal loot isn't that much better than LFR.<br />

<br />
You're not rolling against 24 players. There isn't a set quantity of items dropping from the boss, so there's no 'shot at loot rights' to 'fight' over. It's not musical chairs where there's 10 chairs and 25 people sprinting to them.<br />
<br />
It's like the ICC Raid Quest bags. You do a task (kill a boss), you receive the bag quest reward satchel (your individual shot at raid boss loot) and you get either gold + valor points OR an epic + valor points. You get one of these 'bags' each time you kill a boss.<br />
<br />
The end.<br />
<br />
It's just that simple.<br />
<br />
You're not rolling against anyone. You get your &quot;goody bag&quot; (read: roll window) and you &quot;open&quot; it (click applicable 'yes I would like to get an item' button). It can even be compared to the geodes from Dragon Soul normal/heroic. You get a guaranteed shot at a gem from each boss, you crack it open and you may or may not get an epic gem, but you'll always get SOMETHING, and your success at it has zero dependency on whether or not anyone else in your group got something. Zilch. Zip. None whatsoever.<br />
<br />
People are making this seem like a quantum physics engine of rolling and group politics. It's not. As shown by the blue responses on that whole thread and how some of even more are carrying on restating things incorrectly in THIS thread, a lot of you people are trying to make a mountain out of a molehill. Just read the blue text and apply some common sense.<br />
<br />
<br />
A MAJOR patch every 4 months, and a MINOR patch every 2? If they keep up with this promise, I will be really impressed.Not holding my breath though.<br />
<br />
Incidentally, this is the exact same thing Blizzard promised leading up to the launch of 4.1. My immediate reaction was, &quot;Well okay then, for this to have any relevance, 4.1 needs to come out NOW (February-ish 2011) and 4.2 needs to come out in April (2011) or else I'm not impressed.&quot; They wound up being off by 1 and 3 months, respectively.<br />
<br />
So yeah, no one should hold their breath on this, but damn would it ever be nice if they could pull it off.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, it doesn't really require much skill in pressing need, greed or pass button in the first place.<br />
<br />
And rolling system will most likely be balanced in a way that it rewards the approximate same amount of loot than normal/heroic versions. <br />
However that may be, there's still the possibility, even though it's extremely unlikely, that every single person will win their rolls. It still does not mean that everyone will get loot since bosses only drop certain amount of randomized loot per kill (3-4 items from the actual boss loot table).</div></div><hr />

Maybe you don't even do hardmodes, then feel pissed because your normal loot isn't that much better than LFR.<br />
<br />
some people...<br />
<br />
I'm not totally against LFR. I'm glad people get to see all the great and hard work Blizzard puts into raids/dungeons etc. I'm more annoyed about how the current system allows people to afk through LFR, and still win&quot;epics&quot;... if you barely have to do anything but show up to get them, why ot just make them blues?<br />
<br />
And how do you know? Are you in charge of Blizzard? I remember in wrath, a lot of people being annoyed when LFD came out, then the debuff to ICC... they said &quot;how much easier and more casual can you get? Will raids be next?&quot;<br />
<br />
If you guys want to pull the &quot;majority rules&quot; argument, what about people who actually spend the most time in the game? Shouldn't that matter? SO Blizzard should pander to the people who spend an hour a week in lfr, as opposed to people who spend multiple hours a day? I don't play many MMO's anymore, but I've always thought that effort+time invested+skill= reward. I was just in an LFR and a guy did 9k dps overall. He still won some epics. But thats okay. He paid 15$ right?<br />
<br />
So I guess its pretty much just pay to get epics?</div></div><hr />

You can complain all day about people getting rewarded for playing (I'll assume that's all it is since more difficult challenges give unique rewards you can show off), but the bottom line is that you're a minority and you're no longer being catered to the extent you were in vanilla. There are still plenty of challenges out there with appropriately elite rewards that you can go for that many people will probably never get, like the gold medals that were mentioned. If you want to be an elitist, you still can, but that requires effort, as it should.<br />

Are you saying clicking need, greed or pass requires skill? The solution is very simple really. You down a boss, you get a reward. What reward that is will be determined by behind-the-scenes loot rolls. All this does is reward you for making the effort, rather than giving the majority of the raid the proverbial finger.

LFR can be all about what they said originally, a way for casuals to see the lore and story, and a training ground for Normal mode. You can hit dungeons, then heroics, then LFR. You get all that. The training, loot, and you get to see the story. No more &quot; Only 1% saw the Sunwell arguments. Tons of people saw ICC by the way... without LFR.</div></div><hr />

You still need to have them. It doesn't diminish the rarity of the mounts as much as it just gives you the ability to show them where ever you play. You still have to earn the mounts with one class to gain it for the others.</div></div><hr />

What difference does it make to you if 25 people win loot on a boss? You still get your one roll, that doesn't change, and now they're not interfering with you. Seriously, who gives a damn how much loot random strangers get?<br />

Thats my point. You should care. Why not just give you whatever loot you want? I feel like having that, that and that today, so give it to me! GIMME GIMME GIMME. Why would someone want jewelry? Its more useless than this fake gear we play the game for?<br />

I totally agree. I have been saying account wide achievements and mounts/pets since they came out. I just think if I &quot;Achieve&quot; something, I shouldn't have to do it multiple times just to have it on multiple toons. Hopefully they do SOMETHING with achievement points as well. Plus they already give ALL of your toons mounts you buy in the stores, I don't see a difference between that and letting all my toons have my red proto drake...</div></div><hr />

Remember, the likelihood of that happening is extremely remote. Keep in mind that the boss still only drops a few actual items regardless of how many winners there are. If 25 people did win, 5 would get actual items. The rest would get a token amount of gold.</div></div><hr />

<br />
First, I've been a hardcore raider for the majority of my WOW playing time and probably will be again for MoP, so I'm not arguing from a casual perspective. My question is: why WOULD LFR loot be blue, when epics have been the norm for a max-level character since, well, TBC? In TBC I was very casual, the only raids I ever did was Kara and Gruul in a very shitty guild, and I was full epic anyway. If epics are the norm for being a maxlevel character, as it is now, how will you explain putting blues on the casual players, and moreover, for what reason? Will it enhance their gaming experience? Probably the contrary. Not to mention that, the casuals you refer to may be wanting to feel 'epic' too, and the issues associated with the difference in stats between a blue and an epic item, essentially hampering said casuals from going from LFR to an organized casual guild run to normal modes, as on top of their supposed lack of skill they won't have the gear to compensate for that. I know that sounds incredible to you but why wouldn't they be allowed to have some fun even if their skill or time commitment, or both, won't allow them to invest hugely in WoW? Myself, and I suppose you too, will have their heroic modes. Every now and then we join LFR, and the items that drop, like today, although still of 'epic' quality, will be several ilevels lower than those you get in normal/heroic and in no way compare to items you'll already have or will be getting next reset. The big LOOKING FOR RAID text on the item also gives away that what that player did, if you like to think of it like this, didn't require any actual skill or effort. So what's the point of making it a 'blue' too?<br />
<br />
See, the benefit of LFR is not just to see lore, or whatever. That's a great excuse, but the reality about any RPG mode is character progression. In WoW this comes first in the project of leveling, and once you hit the cap, you 'level' your items. If you go from quest blues to raid blues, what did you level? Nothing at all. 'Epic' quality, as I argued before, has become the norm, changing that back will go as easily as changing heroics to have some kind of actual skill requirement in a group of complete strangers such as the start of Cata - it just won't work. Instead you work with epics that become gradually better over the endgame content, rather than blues that, today, are leveling items.<br />
<br />
Give people a chance to feel epic too. You and I, we do our heroic modes, or whatever, likely we will be on new tier mounts before said casual even knows it's in the game. We have our fun that way. &quot;They&quot;, they will have their fun with LFR. I honestly don't see the issue. Loot whine in LFR currently is a really annoying aspect of LFR and through this new system this is entirely addressed and hopefully, meeting up with random strangers will be an enjoyable experience rather than one that will likely turn into a flamewar.<br />
<br />
As a disclaimer: I do not look down on casual playing. For all intents and purposes, it's exactly what I am now after our guild started hibernating. I joined a casual guild on some other realm and they've finally downed deathwing on normal with some of my help last week. They were as happy as I would have been with a first heroic Deathwing kill, and in fact, no, I was as happy for them because it was still an effort we all did together, despite the low dps and lackluster healing. In the end that all didn't matter, everyone still did their best in their own way. That was a great experience and an eye-opener that this game, for everyone, can be a challenge, and though this particular normal mode may not be a challenge for me and my guild, it doesn't mean it isn't for others: it still is for tons of other players. That doesn't devalue their effort in any form or way either. They got the same amount of satisfaction and put the same amount of work in it as heroic raiders, just on a different level. They deserved every reward they got and every nerdscream after the kill. So, for this reason, I'll stand up for casual players. They deserve their epics, though they're not on the same level as heroic mode epics. They deserve their happiness and joy and a comfortable environment to play in.</div></div><hr />

Well, this game is thankfully not SWTOR so...good on them to not try to monkey after &quot;no-auto-attacks&quot;. It might work in games designed with that in mind from the start, but in WoW I'm sure it'd felt clunky and weird.</div></div><hr />

It was considered rare until they started making it more available. You can get it from boss drop or from the tank/healer reward thing. What makes mounts like that even less rare is when you see them on many characters. Yes the same player but different characters. It's not that hard to understand.<br />
For me it's always been, you have 1 main and that's the char that you should excel at, enjoy playing the most and have the better items/mounts etc etc.. the fact the game has become so shit and classes going tits up at a moments notice means nearly everyone has alts now and they swap and change over to randomly. They want to have say swift zg tiger on the alts also because it they're fav mount etc which is what blizzard are doing now.<br />
<br />
Personally I think this is another form of homogenization of the game, there's no penalty or cost for changing mains etc bar gear maybe.<br />
<br />
Now this may seem a bit dramatic but it also decreases players 'connection' with their characters, yes they are pixels and all that but I mean along the lines of watching an epic movie and really rooting for a character in it.. your playing the game in some cases for years such as much self. Ive had my one characters for around 6 years now and I put everything into that one, if I roll another character I may like the class to play but its my main that would be the one that 'matters' most after the time you put into it and its pixels.<br />
<br />
I found blizzard over the years encouraged this type of thing.. almost on an RPlol level if you will. You create your character and you level with it and in some cases give a shit about it.<br />
The more changes that get announced in this game and the upcoming exp the more and more I see blizzard shift from a gamers gaming company to a 'timmy power gamer, logs in, kills all of the stuff, logs out' gaming company. They seem to have inadvertently created one decrepit player base in the process. There has always been ninja's and crap but it's just insane how bad it's gotten. There weak measures to resolve ingame issues with players is laughable. These short term bans and perma bans which players can get out of etc just show that they are just in full on money mode more than ever.<br />
Gone off on a total tangent here but it all ties in together mo.<br />
<br />
Nothing is rare anymore, if it is it will be made easier to get or re-skinned mortal combat style. There's ton''s of mounts but there's nothing worse than seeing endless reskins which while they say that won't happen anymore... like class stacking... I give it 2 months before it starts again. Here's a brand new mount... with 4 colour types.. ie of the north/south/east/west mounts, tbc onyx drakes etc etc. Fine they are the basic mounts and color options are fine there but when it comes to boss mounts etc bar Mims head, while close to a mechano chopper, its probably the closet to rare now. Even alar has the purple guild version and yes it takes away from the original. Yes it's easy to spot the difference but it still takes away from the original regardless.<br />
<br />
It's easy to see from both sides why this type of thing is good and bad for the game. I happen to see it like many others in a broader sense rather than just 'i can haz teh mountz on all of the chars nau'.</div></div><hr />

In LFR, a rogue or warrior would never be offered a bow as a loot reward. Rogues and warriors will still be able to equip ranged weapons, but they would be very sub-optimal for doing so (sort of the equivalent of a warrior wearing cloth). We left the ability to equip weapons for role-playing reasons and because some existing rogues and warriors have epic or legendary ranged weapons, and it would be mean if they could no longer equip them at all.me like! thx blizz.still be able to equip my thoridal as a rogue :D</div></div><hr />

That's not true actually. If they do not go with the plan of only a certain amount of players win the roll, then everyone can win the roll (although that chance will still be small). When you win, it checks if the boss has anything on its loot table that you can use. If so, you get it, if not, you get gold. This means 25 players could get loot, if the boss has loot for all classes/specs on his table and everyone won the roll. He doesn't drop just 5 items, he gives you something from his entire loot table (could even be 12 times the same bow and 13 times the same trinket).</div></div><hr />

If they keep up with this promise, I will be really impressed.Not holding my breath though.<br />
<br />
Remember, they want the xpacs to stay for less time, they get a huge load of extra $$$ from xpacs sales. Also, less content for &quot;free&quot;.<br />
<br />
They've tried it with Cataclysm, except that they couldn't handle the &quot;1 year or less&quot; lifespan for it and we got all this mess. Cataclsym was designed with 6 month lifetime for each tier and they sudently felt like going to the better ($$$ wise) 2/4 month schedule, but ended up with the current 6 month schedule and 2/4 month content. Blame it on T11 for holding interest so well with 3 diferent raids, extra heroic boss and diferent mechanics instead of just &quot;huge dificult to beat&quot; timers like FL/DS. The diference between ZG and ZA rehashes show it really well... 4.1 should be only ZG, but they had to fill it up with something else to hold so long for FL, so they re-packed ZA, changed the last guy (but not the boss itself), no quests leading to it like they did for ZG and released it together with the one that they really worked on it (ZG).<br />
<br />
Minor patches does not mean little raids, tons of stuff, etc... it means things exactly like 4.1 (1 or 2 re-used stuff as heroics) or molten front like dailies.<br />
<br />
And big patches every 4 months means that small &amp; fast raids like FL will fit better, with the nerfs not hurting all that anymore since it won't be like 5 months with 20%+ debuffs like it was for FL. Also means that they will probably nerf things even harder after the 1st world kill, otherwise only the world 1st guilds will end up killing everything on heroic and only players who actually care about raiding will do some decent progress on it before the next tier 4 months later (since the way they handled things since FL shows that waiting for next tier gear to kill the bosses that you couldn't kill on their tier was a blasphemy that needed to be dealt with fast and furiously).<br />
<br />
Also could mean that by default, things will be easier now instead of waiting for nerfs. 14 bosses in the begining of a xpac that should only last for 4 months before the 1st patch is kinda of overkill. With all the leveling, gearing, grinding, etc. plus the 2 month minor patch, most of those 14 bosses will probably be Morchok &quot;cousins&quot;.<br />
<br />
And the &quot;night in mists of pandaria&quot;? Crap, lol.<br />

<br />
Exactly, there is no more a few drops per boss to fight over 24 other players. The boss now drop 25 &quot;items&quot;, one for each player. If you're getting yours or not, it's your problem with your dice roll and class loot avaiability on him.<br />
<br />
You roll against Blizzard now, not other player :)<br />
<br />
It makes sense with their schedule of 4 months per tier. You need to get the shinies faster now.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lemonpartyfan</div><div class="date">2012-03-20, 12:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">First, I've been a hardcore raider for the majority of my WOW playing time and probably will be again for MoP, so I'm not arguing from a casual perspective. My question is: why WOULD LFR loot be blue, when epics have been the norm for a max-level character since, well, TBC? In TBC I was very casual, the only raids I ever did was Kara and Gruul in a very shitty guild, and I was full epic anyway. If epics are the norm for being a maxlevel character, as it is now, how will you explain putting blues on the casual players, and moreover, for what reason? Will it enhance their gaming experience? Probably the contrary. Not to mention that, the casuals you refer to may be wanting to feel 'epic' too, and the issues associated with the difference in stats between a blue and an epic item, essentially hampering said casuals from going from LFR to an organized casual guild run to normal modes, as on top of their supposed lack of skill they won't have the gear to compensate for that. I know that sounds incredible to you but why wouldn't they be allowed to have some fun even if their skill or time commitment, or both, won't allow them to invest hugely in WoW? Myself, and I suppose you too, will have their heroic modes. Every now and then we join LFR, and the items that drop, like today, although still of 'epic' quality, will be several ilevels lower than those you get in normal/heroic and in no way compare to items you'll already have or will be getting next reset. The big LOOKING FOR RAID text on the item also gives away that what that player did, if you like to think of it like this, didn't require any actual skill or effort. So what's the point of making it a 'blue' too?<br />
<br />
See, the benefit of LFR is not just to see lore, or whatever. That's a great excuse, but the reality about any RPG mode is character progression. In WoW this comes first in the project of leveling, and once you hit the cap, you 'level' your items. If you go from quest blues to raid blues, what did you level? Nothing at all. 'Epic' quality, as I argued before, has become the norm, changing that back will go as easily as changing heroics to have some kind of actual skill requirement in a group of complete strangers such as the start of Cata - it just won't work. Instead you work with epics that become gradually better over the endgame content, rather than blues that, today, are leveling items.<br />
<br />
Give people a chance to feel epic too. You and I, we do our heroic modes, or whatever, likely we will be on new tier mounts before said casual even knows it's in the game. We have our fun that way. &quot;They&quot;, they will have their fun with LFR. I honestly don't see the issue. Loot whine in LFR currently is a really annoying aspect of LFR and through this new system this is entirely addressed and hopefully, meeting up with random strangers will be an enjoyable experience rather than one that will likely turn into a flamewar.<br />
<br />
As a disclaimer: I do not look down on casual playing. For all intents and purposes, it's exactly what I am now after our guild started hibernating. I joined a casual guild on some other realm and they've finally downed deathwing on normal with some of my help last week. They were as happy as I would have been with a first heroic Deathwing kill, and in fact, no, I was as happy for them because it was still an effort we all did together, despite the low dps and lackluster healing. In the end that all didn't matter, everyone still did their best in their own way. That was a great experience and an eye-opener that this game, for everyone, can be a challenge, and though this particular normal mode may not be a challenge for me and my guild, it doesn't mean it isn't for others: it still is for tons of other players. That doesn't devalue their effort in any form or way either. They got the same amount of satisfaction and put the same amount of work in it as heroic raiders, just on a different level. They deserved every reward they got and every nerdscream after the kill. So, for this reason, I'll stand up for casual players. They deserve their epics, though they're not on the same level as heroic mode epics. They deserve their happiness and joy and a comfortable environment to play in.<br />
<br />
I understand a lot of what you are saying and I enjoyed reading your post. But being max level has never meant you get epics. In classic, you didn't get epics unless you did raids, or certain quests, or dungeon tier gear. IN TBC, only end heroic bosses and raids had epics. NOW you get them from heroics, LFR and so on. ALL bosses in HoT heroics are epics. So your argument for max levels always getting epics is a little off.<br />
<br />
The gap has almost always been having blues in raids. I had blues from dungeons to MC, blues form Heroics to Kara, I had Blues in Wrath raids (Naxx, Sarth, Vault). I honestly can't remember having any or many epics going into Kara. Going into LFR raids, I already had mostly purple gear, from heroics, rep, easy world quests... Whats next ? Everyone will have legendary gear? Oh wait....<br />
<br />
I don't look down on casuals either. For the record I have never said casuals don't have skill, I have said LFR just takes almost none. Many people AFK or under perform. I look down on certain players attitudes. It really doesn't take THAT much more time to pug a normal raid. I did it today actually. I went 4/8 with very few wipes but had to go. Earlier this week, my guild asked me to finish a raid that was just 7/8. I haven't been &quot;raiding&quot; or a real &quot;raider&quot; this whole xpac. These were just random things that happened. People that complain about how hard raiding is just don't feel like investing a little more time in the game.<br />
<br />
In MoP, they could change the color meaning of gear back to the way they were. Instead of blues being &quot;leveling gear&quot; as you said, let leveling gear be green. When everyone has all epics, they aren't epic, they are just common.<br />
<br />
The other argument is difficulty. LFR difficulty is on level with NORMAL dungeons. I've wiped more times in BC heroics, Wrath heroics, and even Cata heroics. I've maybe wiped a total of 5 times in LFR, how is that &quot;epic&quot;? I just feel like this would make MORE people happy. The people who follow my mindset would feel better about them being blues, casuals still get to see the end game, and everyone gets a little practice.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So does this mean we will eventually see Sunwell return as a level 90 raid? :D<br />
<br />
I think they included this to show the benefit of LFR, rather than the possibility of Sunwell returning. LFR allows a much higher percentage of the playerbase to experience the content, while regular and heroic mode allow for guilds to compete with each other for progression, with better loot as a reward for their efforts.</div></div><hr />

Stop lying. You clearly do not remember World of Warcraft that well. First of all they had &quot;epics&quot; in vanilla that did not require raiding, they were random world drops. With the battlegrounds you got a few more. In TBC end bosses had epic gear but take a closer look on the item levels. It was just a coloring thing, same as with wotlk.<br />
<br />
You did not get epic gear from heroics in cataclysm. That was something they *added* with zul dungeons and hots. You only got blue gear from heroics. A step down from TBC/Wotlk, if you really bother about the &quot;color&quot;. Again, take a closer look at the actual item level of your &quot;epic&quot;. Of course the dungeons start to drop epic gear towards the end of an expansion. People *hate* the cataclysm dungeons. The hots are fine tho.<br />
<br />
Hopefully Blizzard learned a lesson to keep raid mechanics in raids and have the 5-man dungeons &quot;simple&quot;. The casual player *PUGGING* a dungeon does NOT want to wipe on trash and at every boss. I think that has been proven over the year that you lose subscribers going down that road. Who cares if you run a dungeon with your guild, you're in the minority. Most people uses the LFD tool to randomly group up with people. Same applies to the LFR. I do like the idea behind the LFR but it fails in execution. However it gives people who would normally never raid the option to at least see content they paid for.</div></div><hr />

This has ben said a cuple of times. Just to get some perspective on that: Assuming that each individuals chance for loot is 25% (which is rather generous ) the probability for a boss giving everyone in the raid loot would be 0.2525 or 8.882*10-16. Written out: 0.000000000000000882. this is a so small chance, that even if there are going to be 1 million lfr groups each week, killing 10 bosses each week for thousands of years it would be very unlikely for this to happen once. And while there is a chance that more people than normal get loot, there a similar chance that lesss people than normal get loot.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Another more serious thing is how FAR the game has gone &quot;casual&quot;... history says if they follow that path, and keep following it, how EASY will this game become? LFR is pretty much just a &quot;barely try for 1 hour&quot; and get &quot;slightly worse&quot; loot than normal raids are... will it become &quot;yay you hit 90, here is a full set of epics&quot;?<br />

People tend to care more about things they invest time and effort into. You yourself are on this website, debating about it so I think you are taking it more seriously than you let on. <br />

Well community forums is totally different thing than a video game, and no I'm not taking it too serious I'm just dissapointed by the amount of people who take this game as a second job and care about rewards more than enjoying the game itself in term of gameplay not about loots, epics, and rewards. This is my point.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, those Pro-LFR people pretty much only care about the loot. The way this game is going is what concerns me, When reward is less about work effort and skill and just about paying 15 bucks. When your experience is more about doing your own thing and less about community, working well with others and socializing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well I won't speak for the playbase of SWTOR, but I absolutely loathe the lack of an auto-attack. It makes the entire system feel incredibly awkward, IMO. In fact, I wasn't intending to roll a monk for that exact reason. So if you want to blame anyone, blame folks like me who find the lack of auto-attack uncomfortable.</div></div><hr />

Anything leading you to believe dungeon heroic drops WON'T be blue like in Cata? Because those and maybe purple craftables is -always- what you wear into the first raids. This will be the same for casuals and hardcores, unless the latter find their heroic DS T13 better. Everybody -will- be full 'epic' after the first tier.<br />
<br />
Only mistake Blizz ever made in that regard was giving colors names like &quot;Rare&quot; and &quot;Epic&quot;. It's blue and purple. You are here effectively arguing that no other car should be allowed to be red, because Ferraris are red.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Second, if you happen to get haste shoulders over mastery, reforge it<br />
<br />
As for getting 11 attempts at something and getting 5 of another, beats seeing 20 of said item drop and getting 0<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT: A second look at it is almost insulting, you claim this is an example of &quot;poor bad greedy immature players&quot; and yet the beginning is all about a list that goes:<br />

Is not for my spec, because I am poor and do not want to reforge<br />
Not in BiS list, cuz I'm greedy and only want the best<br />
<br />
I mean, you're partially right, because it eliminates competition against players causing it to be purely about you, a rather selfish thing. But those that aren't greedy or bad or poor will know RNG when they see it and not look a gift horse in the mouth</div></div><hr />

Well, to be fair, they just said that he would be corrupted. It did not say that it was by an Old God (though the possibility is there). Also, it would be sort of interesting if Jaina ended up possessed by Sargeras. Sargeras sort of disappeared and hasn't been really talked about much... if he starts messing with the folks in Azeroth once again, that could be the perfect lead into another Burning Legion centered expansion pack (of course, this wouldn't be for another year or so after MoP).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Really? Really? That is how my post was interpreted.<br />
<br />
I don't run LFR for the giggles, the laugh or the fun. There is nothing fun about EU LFR, consistently failing on easy bosses, wiping to stupidity and playing with people who have no idea how to raid, and don't want to learn, but do it just for some loot. <br />
<br />
I run LFR on my alts, as I did on my main before Dragon Soul, because it is a new gate/level of gearing, now pretty much required to improve on ones dps when going into progression raiding.<br />
<br />
Acquiring gear to improve your character isn't greedy, its what the game is about : /<br />
<br />
Your points make absolutely no sense <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I already have, cuz I'm greedy and don't want things I already have<br />
Is not for my spec, because I am poor and do not want to reforge<br />
Not in BiS list, cuz I'm greedy and only want the best<br />
<br />
1) This is not being greedy. My mind cant fathom your point. Why would anyone be happy winning a roll and gettin an item they already have? please explain? If I Gloves and Shoulders drop, my roll should be for what I need, not what the system assigns me, despite me already having it. Thats counter intuitive and wasteful.<br />
<br />
2) Maybe you need to read up on reforging? You can't reforge 100% - 100% of the stat in question. If as a destro lock I want haste, I want haste, end off. Its not greedy or me being poor, wanting the items that actually improve my characters performance. Thats playing the game, and being a good player : /<br />
<br />
3) So your trolling me now, and it took me this long to get it. A bis list is BEST IN SLOT. Hence, of course I want the best items?!?!?!?!?! Some of us go to the bother of actually working out gear lists that we feel will optomise our numbers in an effort to aid our raiding teams/guilds to down bosses. BIS lists are part of that. <br />
<br />
Is it no wonder LFR is such a fail going by how the above poster commented on my pretty blatantly obvious points. <br />

The winners of the rolls get handed items that they can use ( regardless if they have it or want that particular item)<br />

<br />
Boss drops 5 items<br />
25 players roll<br />
Top 5 rolls are selected.<br />
1 of these players cannot use the items, receives gold<br />
4 other players receives items they can equip<br />
6th best roll is selected and granted item<br />
<br />
<br />

That just sounds terrible...... making it almost skill less to get the loot, then possibly giving every person loot from every single boss?<br />
<br />
Firstly, there's no skill AT ALL in clicking Need. Secondly, the new roll system won't change (by much) the chances of you winning an upgrade. Let's use this rather crude example:<br />
<br />
Current LFR Loot system<br />
40% chance of a particular upgrade to drop for you.<br />
4 other raid members who are eligible to win it too.<br />
Chances of you getting piece: 20% x 40% = 8%<br />
<br />
New LFR Loot system<br />
You must /roll 93 or above to win an item (Made up number)<br />
Chance of you winning the upgrade = 8%<br />
<br />
(Yes, this is a rather simplified example and I acknowledge that sometimes a boss can drop more than one upgrade for you or none at all)<br />
<br />
The new system won't change anything in terms of you getting loots, the only thing it'll change is that you don't need to press Need anymore (as if it's hard in the first place...) and there won't be nerdraging on loots anymore. No more votekicking for &quot;ninjaing&quot; or qq-ing for the remainder of the raid about how much you deserve the trinket more, if you don't win a loot it's your own bad luck, you can't blame others anymore.<br />

Top 5 rolls are selected.<br />
1 of these players cannot use the items, receives gold<br />
4 other players receives items they can equip<br />
6th best roll is selected and granted item<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This is the same sort of loot system Star Wars uses in its low difficulty of raiding, and its a travisty.<br />
<br />
You won't be rolling against anyone, at all. Only against yourself. Think of it this way: Everyone gets to roll, those who rolled 95 and above wins a random useable loot from the boss, if you roll above 95 and there's nothing there for you you will get gold instead. So it's possible for all 25 people to win something although very very unlikely. <br />
<br />
Current system: You hope that the item you want will drop and if it does drop you hope that you will win the roll against 1-24 other people. Or alternatively you call click Need on everything you can.<br />
<br />
New system: You hope that you will roll a winning value/number/whatever, and if you do win, you hope it'll be the item that you want. If there's nothing for you then you'll get gold.<br />
<br />
Blizzard can tweak these winning values and in the end the chances of you getting a particular item is more or less the same as it is currently. They did say that the aim of the new system is just to streamline loot rolls in LFRs and to minimise loot dramas.</div></div><hr />

O thanks for that.<br />
<br />
So in theory there is a bracket for winning rolls, and if you roll over that everyone gets loot?<br />
<br />
So in theory, if me and three guys roll 98 for a trinket, we all get the trinket?<br />
<br />
So there is no longer just 4 pieces of loot, but 4 pieces of loot, that could go to like 15 people? Something like that? <br />
<br />
EG. 1 Trinket could go to 8 people if they roll right?</div></div><hr />

I know some people still playing tell me they get griefed all the time by players already wearing the items and they need the items purely to give to their friends, DE, vendor, or just be jerks. I never felt the LFR was meant for guilds looking for a few more because it is 25 man and easy mode. Guilds typically will do the current content in normal or heroic mode, right? And the majority of guilds out there are doing 10 man anyhow, so this system was ripe for being abused. You can't tell me they designed it with the intent of allowing guilds or friends farm gear at the expense of others, that is simply not how they do things at Blizz. It was another exploit developed by the community.</div></div><hr />

What I don't understand is, obviously a large number of people have asked for it, since Blizzard is making a point to let us know it's not happening any time soon. If SO many people have asked...why not just implement it? I'd be willing to pay gold for it, hell, I'd even pay money for it. I've never wanted to have three specs more than I have this expansion. Dropping a spec, getting a new one, re-gemming, re-enchanting, re-glyphing, reforging, it gets pretty pricey. Why, if people are bringing it to your attention, and you can make more money off of it, wouldn't you put it in the game? Sounds like a smart idea to me.<br />
<br />
&quot;A new minor glyph that allow druids to stay in tree form has been added.&quot;<br />
<br />
My god about time. I wanted to be a resto druid simply because of being able to be in tree form full time. I don't see why it needs to be a glyph though. ;/ Should just go back to the way it was in Wrath and make it permanent without having to give up glyphs for it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Blizzard will be revisiting the shared 10 and 25 man lockout to make sure it is still the right thing.&quot;<br />
<br />
It's not, for the love of christ. Worst thing you guys ever did other than get rid of the ability for people to have their own personal specs. I miss being able to go into 10 mans and clear stuff then go do the same bosses in 25 man. It's a pain in the ass, being shafted like this. It screws the people who like doing 10 and 25 mans, forcing us to pick whether we do things just as 10 mans, or just as 25 mans, with no in between. Get rid of the shared lockouts and put them back to seperate.</div></div><hr />

No shit! Pardon the language, but I got burned out when I was barely halfway; and I thought I did quite well. Still tempted to pick it up again and try for the mount, but part of me would rather take a fireball to the chest.<br />
<br />
If titles become account wide, you will be able to use it at the level you could have earned it at.<br />
I really hope this will happen. I'm not going to have much time to play alts, but using any of my main's titles (within reason) would be great. I can't see being able to use certain privileged titles across the board, such as my FoS one, or if the character isn't exalted themselves; but titles from boss defeats, heroic achievement completion and the like could come in handy.<br />
<br />
Mounts are on the list of things to be made account wide, either at launch or a patch soon after.<br />
Excellent! I will finally be able to fly my warrior's Blue Proto-Drake and ride my rogue's Kodo on my mage! I hope alts' mounts will count towards the total. Having gone casual a long time ago, followed by a few long breaks, I'm still not at 100 mounts.<br />
<br />
It still isn't clear if the final version of MoP will raise the guild level cap or not. However, the guild experience caps will be removed.<br />
Chances are good that they will raise the level cap. What good can come of guilds being stuck at level 25 with nothing new to look forward to?<br />
<br />
Green level difficulty and harder quests may give a flat amount of guild experience in order to allow lower level players to contribute to guild leveling.<br />
I thought this was already the case, but obviously lower level characters weren't gaining nearly enough experience for their guilds.<br />
<br />
Before Wrath of the Lich King came out, less than one percent of the playerbase actually experienced Sunwell.<br />
... A fact that gets mentioned periodically. I guess they do like to bring up past failures again. At least this made them realise the game is more about shoving in last minute raids at the end of an expansion. Oh wait...<br />
<br />
There is a possibility of another troll dungeon, as some trolls live on an island off the coast of Pandaria.<br />
Sounds neat! The Zandalar remakes were a nightmare, but I'm sure that with a fresh dungeon it could be quite cool.<br />
<br />
Blizzard would have liked to do a 15 man raid size if they were starting from scratch today. However, for now they are sticking with both 10 and 25 man.<br />
I wonder why they even mentioned this? 15-man raiding would be epic enough to actually be quite cool, and getting 15 people together on one night is bound to be a darn sight easier than 25.<br />
<br />
Raid tiers should last roughly four months, with content updates also coming between the larger raid updates. This could mean we would see a patch every two months or so.<br />
Here's hoping...<br />
<br />
If you win a roll in LFR and the boss has no item for you, you will get gold instead.<br />
We already knew this. Or did I read it on WHN? Good move on their part. Seems more like a win-win situation overall.<br />
<br />
Druid glyphs.<br />
So cool! Especially the following:<br />
A new minor glyph that changes a druid's travel form into a white stag has been added. Other players can ride you while in this form. Lol.<br />
<br />
There may be a Labours of Hercules style quest chain that you do for Varian to show you more of the story and let you get to know him better.<br />
I look forward to this, as with a lot of character changes and appearances to come. Many people dis Varian, but I think the man has a fortitude that many leaders lack. I like him as our king and hope to see more of him in a very kingly role.<br />
<br />
Looking forward to even more changes and additions. The expansion in my mind seems to be heading in a good direction; for me. For others, not quite so much. And I get that. But here's to getting excited and ramped up about what is to come: fun. :)</div></div><hr />

With 11 classes a 10 man raid needs to at least bench 1 class each time, while a 15 man raid would give you 4 double options and still have all classes raiding, and gives possibiliteis for the future to add classes as well</div></div><hr />

&quot;In addition, with the upcoming launch of Diablo III, players in certain regions will also be able to use their Battle.net Balance to acquire items from the game's currency-based auction house.&quot; <br />
<br />
Already planned for Diablo III, with the addition of &quot;Black Market&quot; windows in WoW with items auctioned by NPCs ( ie Blizzard) instead of players isn't that a step to that direction?</div></div><hr />

Lastly, am i the only one that thinks this is a little weird like dragon turtle mount druid form changes ect. Are we seeing an early april fools? :p<br />
<br />
To answer briefly:<br />
<br />
1.) LFR Loot System will work like this:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
You will only be rolling against yourself.<br />
The bosses will have randomized loot for every single kill (Internal Loot - which you will not be able to see). Every time you kill a boss there's a chance of it dropping a certain item (About 3-4 different items per kill).<br />
Every time you kill a raid boss that rewards loot, the game will automatically roll for you (This is also done internally).<br />
If you win the roll &amp; the boss has loot that you can put to use, you will get that loot.<br />
If you win the roll &amp; the boss does not have a loot for you, you will get gold instead.<br />
If you lose the roll you obviously get nothing.<br />
There is a possibility for &quot;a bonus&quot; roll using an item purchased from one of the Pandaren factions. This is &quot;an extra&quot; roll if you did not to win the loot with your first roll.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
2.) Yes. You will be able to use every single mount you own on any character in the game. Only requirement is the level. To use Swift Zulian Tiger (http://www.wowhead.com/item=19902/swift-zulian-tiger) for example, you would have to be level 60 with you character (Considering you got this from the original Zul Gurub which was a level 60 raid).<br />
<br />
3.) They aren't April fools and especially those new Druid forms (Glyphs) are a welcome addition to some players.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Very good notion.<br />
<br />
However, there have been no discussion on that matter and at least now there are no plans to change that (I might have missed something though so don't take my word as final). :cool:</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aerion</div><div class="date">2012-03-21, 05:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">to the many who still don't understand how the new lfr will work:<br />
<br />
Let's say normally X boss has 4 loot in it.<br />
In lfr everyone will roll, top 4 rollers are entitled to win something.<br />
Everyone of the 4 will win an item from the loot table of the boss according to his spec.<br />
If no such loot exist, then they gets money.<br />
<br />
SO NO, 25 PEOPLE CAN'T GET LEWTZ! And there's not a fixed roll value.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately you got that all wrong:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Raid Boss drops 3-4 items from its loot table. These are random as they always have been.<br />
Every single person in the raid will roll. This is done automatically, so you don't per say roll by pressing a Roll button anymore.<br />
If you win the roll &amp; the boss has loot that you can put to use, you will get that loot.<br />
If you win the roll &amp; the boss does not have a loot for you, you will get gold instead.<br />
If you lose the roll you obviously get nothing.<br />
Every single person that win their own rolls will receive loot/gold. There is no exception here.<br />
There is a possibility for &quot;a bonus&quot; roll using an item purchased from one of the Pandaren factions. This is &quot;an extra&quot; roll if you did not to win the loot with your first roll.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
To really dumb this down:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
All 25 people in you raid will roll against a computer/themselves (how ever you want to think of it).<br />
If you /roll above 50, you win loot/gold.<br />
If you /roll below 50, you get nothing.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
So technically there is, at this moment, a chance that every single person in the raid wins their rolls, but it doesn't mean all the people will necessarily get loot since the boss only drops 3-4 loots per kill.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That actually reads in there. Fourth line in the first list. ;)<br />
<br />
PS.<br />
<br />
I think there is still some gold you get for just killing the boss as well. Like in the old days. Winning your roll just gives you some extra.</div></div><hr />

I was referring to the dumb down version part &quot;If you /roll below 50, you get nothing.&quot;. You'll never get nothing.</div></div><hr />
