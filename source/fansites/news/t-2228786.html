Well it was like this during Hellfire Citadel &amp; Heavensward, But to note that is has been 5-6 months since Nighthold opened. So it does follow the usual timeline of new raids being always 5-6 months during an expansion.</div></div><hr />

Geez, I wonder when preparation patch for Tomb will come if Tomb opens June 20. Maybe September?<br />
<br />
And all LFR hero in this thread - you know you sound pathetic, right? I have currently no static team or high skill - and still I can pug normal first week. And I pug it mostly because no LFR is avaiable and I want see the content/do quests. I support LFR, but sometimes I think it really should be one tier behind when I see spoiled shitposters like you.</div></div><hr />

Actually they've said numerous times Tomb is not attached to 7.2.5. Tomb is already in the game, live, it just needs unlocked. So I'd expect T20 to change in the middle of Tomb most likely.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I believe this started with Highmaul. This generally gives the World First Race guilds a chance to do split heroic runs to have a slightly easier chance at progression on Mythic when it hits. Granted, in Legion it was a bit different with Mythic+, Titanforging and Legendaries as alternative ways to get gear aside from the raid. You will also see most of those guilds do a split heroic run on the Tuesday Reset either before they start the Mythic raid, or after they've hit a wall to attain a little bit better gear.</div></div><hr />

What loser needs to PUG? I could raid with the guild but I (drumroll) *don't want to commit to set hours*. <br />
<br />
It's not that I can't make the time etc. I could, but I don't WANT TO, so I usually LFR to see the instance. Occasionally I'll tag along on the guild raids here and there but they know I'm not going to do it week in and week out. <br />
<br />
Since my 'raiding' is LFR and since Blizzard keeps stretching that out for 6-8 weeks past release, I have zero reason to come back much before August. Why should I pay for 2 months of gated content, esp in the middle of summer?</div></div><hr />

I don't want to commit myself for 2 nights a week, 3 hours at a shot. That's all. There's no 'deserving it' involved and it's hilarious that you think anyone needs to somehow be worth of a video game raid. Grow up.<br />

<br />
Precisely. I don't want to do the scheduled thing and don't really feel like dealing with the PUG stuff. Plus, it's summer. So I'll spend June and July outside and check back in 3 months. For people who like PUGs, fine I suppose but for the person I quoted to act like PUGs are all that was just... amusing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
lots of people dont want to look through the RF to find a grp, queue, get denied or picked up while standing around, where as LFR you can queue, go do a WQ and whenever it pops it pops and you are in.

There is ONE version of it live. There were weeks and months of raidtuning and bugfixing that will be patched into by 7.2.5. <br />
<br />
Have you seen what is ingame? Even the set bonuses and trinkets are wrong not to mention boss encounters and graphics that needed some fixing by testing it. <br />

Patch 7.2.5 will be live on 13th june, perhaps 20th if there are big issues. Not before 13th because of pvp season and not after 20 th because patch wont be after raid release.<br />

7.1.5 was one week before NH so i am sure they will target 13th.</div></div><hr />

Not baiting anyone, but is it a tuning reason?<br />

Actually it was changed in WoD. Mythic opened 2nd week has been the case since. Prior to that you had to fully clear Heroic before accessing Mythic. Now you don't need to touch heroic really, if you want you can wait a week and start with Mythic.</div></div><hr />

I am happy to see NH coming to an end. It is a decent raid, but I rather move to a new raid while I still enjoy at least some of the last one rather then the path they have taken the last few years where people hate or quit the current raid and raids crumble in the vacuum.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The other thing you can do in LFR but not a PUG (usually) is to do a wing at a time. When I LFR I rarely do all the wings on a night, I spread them out so I have something to do on a few different nights. I really wish they'd have made Normal like the old Flex SoO where you had wings but they didn't, Oh well.<br />

It'll be exactly like 7.1.5/NH unlock. The patch will be a week before the raid unlocks to give people a little bit of time to adjust to the changes. 7.1.5 dropped Jan 10th, NH opened the following week on the 17th.</div></div><hr />

There were so many iterations, one very challenging difficulty, one difficulty that was very easy to clear, Hardmodes triggered by mechanics. So many things changed over the course.<br />
<br />
Has always been the case since the introduction of multiple difficulties (Trial of the Crusader bringing this change in Wrath of the Lich King) that the hardest difficulty unlocks 1 week later (at the start you had to as you say clear it on normal for heroic to unlock, so if you didn't clear it on normal the first week then it wasn't available the following week) Then came the whole debacle about a couple guilds that cheated by faction jumping to access it week 1 and when that happened they locked the hardest difficulty entirely till week 2 with the difficulty below no longer being required to be cleared as we still have now.<br />
<br />
The reason the faction jumping worked was because the raid did not have separate lock as they do now by difficulty, you had 1 raid lock whatever you did it on hardest or easiest difficulty, and when faction jumping your raid id was cleared.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I understand all of this. Like I said, I support LFR. But gating this make perfect sense - it encourage people to do normal (people like me for example, I just want to experience bosses, I didn't finish normal ToV for example - LFR was enabled after a week and no quest send me there) and create some kind of progress.<br />
<br />
Also, LFR is amazing for veterans (on &quot;retirement&quot;), but not so much for fresh people that want to see how raiding looks like. Compare any kill on normal+ (when people cooperate and do mechanics) to LFR (which is huge mess, most people just dps to avoid dealing with mechanics, we have trolls, AFK, etc.) - new player after LFR really will have no idea how raiding looks like (and go away from content that he could enjoy).<br />
<br />
And my comment was rather towards people that go apeshit about gating LFR (every single time...). I know some disagree with this design, but they must understand that world doesn't revolve around them.<br />

It's not tinfoilhat when stuff like this has been happening for almost the past 10 years. They definitely hold off updates or try to push them up to get the same day or near release of other games. Does it affect development? Sure, absolutely, but Blizzard is in a position where it can do such things and make it work.</div></div><hr />

You see, the thing is it's what you think vs the word of the industry's insider who happened to lead WoW development and who has 0 reason to be dishonest about it, nevermind the fact that his explanation is certainly making sense on it's own.<br />
<br />
It does not matter what it &quot;seems&quot;, for example in this particular case the fact that Blizzard has 6 months schedule they pledged to uphold seems like a much more plausible explanation why patch is on 20th - i.e. they planned it first and foremost a long time ago to keep the promise and not because FFXIV has expansion.</div></div><hr />

This generally gives the World First Race guilds a chance to do split heroic runs to have a slightly easier chance at progression on Mythic when it hits. Granted, in Legion it was a bit different with Mythic+, Titanforging and Legendaries as alternative ways to get gear aside from the raid. You will also see most of those guilds do a split heroic run on the Tuesday Reset either before they start the Mythic raid, or after they've hit a wall to attain a little bit better gear.<br />

Maybe because FFXIV fanboys go into a thread about upcoming WoW raid unlocks and try to tie that to some bullshit conspiracy theory about how Blizz wants to destroy FF.<br />

Nobody would even say &quot;FFXIV&quot; in this thread if not some FFXIV dolt rush in and start making conspiracy sandcastles.<br />

Most people aren't saying that Blizzard is trying to kill FF, just commenting on the very real fact that the release dates are the same.<br />
<br />
It's not just Blizzard who does this though, just about EVERY company has done it at some point or another and the idea can be traced back all the way to before Quake 3 Arena. Whether they do it on purpose or not is up to the company, hint, it's probably on purpose.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A little bit of common sense would tell you that the only reason they are both the same date is that the financial quarter ends June 30th, so be releasing it so close to the end they get to pad their totals. And of course the 20th is a tuesday and game releases tend to fall on tuesdays.</div></div><hr />

Wrong, wrong, WRONG.<br />
<br />
You don't have to be a FFXIV fanboy (hell, you don't even have to play FF) to know that it might not be a coincidence that the raid comes out the same day as FF's expansion, that's it, that's all.<br />

<br />
Yes. Patches and game releases, especially large ones, tend to come near the end of the financial quarter. Blizzard does it constantly.<br />
<br />
Its not a coincidence, but its not to stifle other games either, its because it makes the most business sense to release big things right near the end of a financial quarter.</div></div><hr />

Not only is it not illegal to do so, it's not even ethically bankrupt because the amount of final fantasy players that are suddenly going to stop caring about an expansion just because ONE raid in wow is coming out on the same day is so god damn small that there's probably more posts about this shit than people who are going to swap.

Well yea, I obviously do still care about a game I have invested 7 years in. Just the lame ass &quot;drag out the raid release for as long as fucking possible&quot; since MoP has gotten to be very, very boring. I've lost all interest in the raid and simply won't be returning to it. Just gonna wait and see if the Argus patch will be worth coming back to. (And it probably will, seeing as how Blizz has released 0 content for 7.2 other than one of the worst questlines the game's ever seen, and has probably been saving all the content for the Argus patch)</div></div><hr />

<br />
It does not matter what it &quot;seems&quot;, for example in this particular case the fact that Blizzard has 6 months schedule they pledged to uphold seems like a much more plausible explanation why patch is on 20th - i.e. they planned it first and foremost a long time ago to keep the promise and not because FFXIV has expansion.<br />
<br />
so every time something big is coming out they just &quot;happen&quot; to have a patch coming on or a week off that date, huh?<br />
<br />
Please, how gullible are you, even Ghostcrawler wouldn't say it because it's likely league would/could do the same thing.. it's just business practice, and that's that. Nothing personal in them lining up their dates.<br />
<br />
For example, I guarantee you Necromancer on D3 will come out extremely close to when Path of Exile's expansion comes out.</div></div><hr />

I don't care about FFXIV, but it's kinda obvious to me that WoW update will come same day - it's WoW biggest competition (no matter how big it's compared to WoW). FFXIV expac date was know for months, Blizz have little more freedom with raid releases. <br />
<br />
On the other hand, kinda sad for ESO players - Blizz seems not give a shit about Morrowind release.</div></div><hr />

Well don't pay attention to trolls. These would be content in wow as well. Would be being the operative word.

yeah, but remember ds lfr? Raiders got 4-set bonuses in the first week (yes they also exploited a bug were they could run the same wing over and over again and get loot) but this is for a way to stop that. the set bonuses are insanely strong (maybe not the ToS ones).<br />

First off, what do you consider &quot;relevant&quot; content? A mount? Second, where did Blizz ever &quot;promise&quot; they wouldn't put that behind missions?<br />
<br />
Second, if doing a +2 to get the item to begin the quest, then a +2 each week for your 20/50 essences is too hard, sorry. +2 is what, a 16% buff over 0? Do a reg mythic, get your +2 stone, do it. Next Tuesday you get 2/5 of what you need for an upgrade and your next +2 stone. And what's the problem with upgrading them one at a time? First you upgrade the ones you use most, then you upgrade the ones you use less, then you upgrade the ones sitting in your bank cause might as well after a month or two.<br />
<br />
AK40 is plenty. I got Concord on all 4 of my main's weapons early last week, no M+ grinding like people think they need to do. I could make a toon right now, get to 110, buy AK35, and easily have Concord before ToS comes out in 3 weeks.<br />
<br />
If you don't like doing LFR in the first place, why are you raging that the wings are being gated? Also why are you acting like this is something new? Are you fishing for things to be upset about? They gated SWP, they gated ICC, they've been gating LFR since the beginning (I think?).</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's not that I can't make the time etc. I could, but I don't WANT TO, so I usually LFR to see the instance. Occasionally I'll tag along on the guild raids here and there but they know I'm not going to do it week in and week out. <br />
<br />
Since my 'raiding' is LFR and since Blizzard keeps stretching that out for 6-8 weeks past release, I have zero reason to come back much before August. Why should I pay for 2 months of gated content, esp in the middle of summer?<br />
<br />
And why should we give a single f*** if and when you come back? It seems, you only sub to see the instance anyway, so you'll join Aug 8, pay for a month, and then are gone again. As opposed to you joining Jun 20th, pay for a month, see the instance and are gone again. Makes absolutely no difference to Blizzard. And with your anti-social attitude it actually should make your guild be even happier to be rid of you for a bit longer.<br />

Debatable if the mount is &quot;part of the class hall campaign&quot;.<br />
<br />
Who said that you need to do m+ to upgrade your leggies? Probably works like last time that you also can do it via Emissary chests. <br />
<br />
AK 40 cap actually helps your alts more than it hurts them. Especially since they introduced that you have instant AK40 on every alt when you have it on your main.<br />
<br />
LFR has always been gated. And rightfully so. Why should the &quot;Idiot-Lottery&quot; allow people to see a RAID instance before the actual raiders?<br />
<br />
Good bye and good riddance. Seriously hope you won't come back next expac. I'm sure your constant shitposting about WoW is hurting Blizzard more than the 2-3 months a year sub fees they get from you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sorry for the desillusion but Blizzard don't give a shit about being in competition with FFXIV. Blizzard have not interests of doing that. <br />
In fact, Blizzard has never looked for compete with others MMOs, they just kept releasing contents and expansions when they were ready, following some schedule logics, and Blizzard will continue that way.<br />
<br />
Believe it or not, but the famous saying of Blizzard : &quot;When it's ready&quot; is true.<br />
<br />
I am not being naive and seeing Blizzard like some nice people who just want to make great games and please players. Of course this is a company looking for profit, but you can be sure that they do make profit without even thinking about playing a pissing contest with other game company.<br />
<br />
We knew since the opening of the Nighthold back in january that the Tomb of Sargeras will be released in june, because it is always about 6 months between raid tiers within an expansion (I can telling you that the raid in Argus will be released in December). Blizzard probably knew back then that they will open it around the 20th. So, if the release date of a random expansion of FFXIV fall the same day than a patch of WoW, it's just a coincidence.<br />
<br />
Don't misunderstand me, I really like FFXIV, I had some good time playing it. And yes I'm sure Blizzard did adjusted some of their releases dates for maximizing profits. But not this time.</div></div><hr />
