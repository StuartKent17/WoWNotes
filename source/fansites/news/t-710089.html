Blue posts<br />
Celestial Steed (not) limited quantity<br />
The store itself does not act as a generator for loot codes, so a set number of codes had to be added to the store. That number is very high. If it's ever reached, we can add more. The item offer isn't intended to be of a limited quantity. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/24262410938/there-s-a-quot-quantity-quot-for-digital-downloads/))<br />
<br />
Mastery and multiple trees<br />
If you are a 5/20/51 Ret paladin, you get mastery bonuses for spending 51 points in Retribution, and nothing else.<br />
<br />
If a rogue is 55/21/0, they get mastery bonuses for spending 51-55 points in Assassination and nothing else.<br />
We went back and forth on this for a bit, but Emogenheap's examples are correct. Basically it came down to two things:<br />
<br />
We could do cooler bonuses (like Balance and Shadow) if we knew it would be restricted to those guys only and not all members of that class.<br />
<br />
Several hybrids would have trouble finding enough attractive in other trees. Why does the Elemental shaman want better melee damage or healing? Meanwhile the Fury warrior happily dips into Arms to pick up their bonuses too. (It's fine to sub-spec into other trees is there are sexy talents there, even if they are different roles. We just didn't want someone to potentially get 9 different passive bonuses from doing so.) (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/24261059932/mastery-and-multiple-trees/))<br />
<br />
Passive Mastery Benefits<br />
On the broader topic of whether more creative or more passive mastery benefits are more fun, we just need to get players in there in beta and trying them out. The risk of more passive bonuses (like the current Enhancement one) is that it's just a little dry. Since your spell damage tends to scale roughly (roughly) with your gear, it risks just feeling like more damage. On the other hand, bonuses like Shadow and Balance affect gameplay an awful lot and may end up being just one too many things to monitor. We wanted to split the difference for now and see what feels the best. It could be that we spice up some of the passive ones or it could be we tone down some of the crazier ones, or we continue to offer a mix and let players gravitate towards what they like. I can see how the more creative ones might just sound more exciting, but then again getting 12 new abilities might sound exciting too until you're struggling with how to learn the nuance of when to use each one (if that lousy analogy makes sense).

<br />
Showing absorbs in combat log<br />
We're still working on showing absorbs. It's technically very challenging. It's not information we currently pass down to the client, and while passing that information down isn't too tricky itself, making sure we can share it without affecting your performance is less trivial. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/24262386570/absorbs-and-damage-reduction-in-logs-when/))<br />
<br />
Vengeance Mastery Bonus<br />
If you've spent much time on this forum in the last several months, you'd have noticed a common theme is that tanks start to have threat problems again at extreme levels of gear. The problem really isn't that surprising. Say that tanks start out doing half the damage of DPS specs. All is well. But the DPS specs continue to improve their DPS stats while tanks continue to improve their survival stats. Even if tanks spend a little effort on threat stats (some of which they get naturally on their gear), they still can't keep up with the DPS specs. It's a gear scaling problem.<br />
<br />
We considered, and rejected, many other solutions to the problem, such as increasing threat modifier or choosing to no longer make tanking gear. Ultimately we decided that there were good things about the way rage works on warriors and bears (translating incoming damage into threat) and the way the mage talent, Incanter's Absorption turned damage taken into damage done. It just provides the damage increase in a way that's controllable.<br />
<br />
Vengeance is NOT there so that you no longer have to ever worry about threat. It's fine with us if you have to consider threat a little bit at the start of a fight. Again, if we wanted to make threat not a factor in WoW, we'd just remove it and have mobs always stick to you rather than just cranking the threat numbers up so high that you don't have to take it very seriously.<br />
<br />
Vengeance is also not designed to keep tank dps high no matter what in any circumstances. It's designed so that when you're being hit, your damage stays elevated. The damage done scales with your health, essentially allowing tank DPS to increase as DPS specs DPS increases. It scales a little bit with damage being taken too so that you don't turn into a juggernaut if a rogue sticks you with a dagger in PvP. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/24261118380/is-vengeance-mastery-fixing-the-wrong-problem/))<br />
<br />
Encounter design and raid composition<br />
Encounter design will always favor someone over someone else. It's probably impossible to make things absolutely even across every class (or even every tank class) on encounters that are tuned this tightly. And really, we wouldn't put that kind of constraint on the encounter designers. It's tough enough coming up with mechanics that you guys aren't totally sick of seeing while still giving you enough flexibility to bring whoever you want.<br />
<br />
If we thought it was impossible or even really, really difficulty for some classes to tank some encounters, then that would cross the line for us. Death knights coming off of Sarth and going into Ulduar crossed the line because the advantages they had seemed like they were giving them an advantage on every fight. Blocking made too much of a difference on Anub, and we probably won't use that mechanic again. The Lich King hits so freaking hard on 25 heroic mode that a giant health pool is pretty useful. But the three guilds that have killed him now have used pretty different comps and even different tanks, so that seems pretty successful. So few guilds have anything approaching a reasonable shot of being able to handle that fight until the buff stack gets much higher that it seems a little silly to worry about it too much. (Props if you guys think you're close.) Meanwhile, you can do every other encounter in the game with the tank of your choice without being at a major disadvantage. Doesn't sound that bad overall. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/24261117700/3-3-3-worked-sorta-for-dks/))<br />
<br />
Downranking<br />
Yes. Actual downranking had two problems though. One, it was a pretty obtuse concept for new players. If you're super elite you might dismiss that concern, but it was something players had to figure out (typically be reading forums or something) and worked nothing else like anything in the game.<br />
<br />
Even more of a concern, a lot of players downranked not only to conserve mana when they didn't need to heal much but because at some point in gear the coefficient starts to matter a lot more than the base points. They could essentially get a fairly powerful heal off at a lower cost.<br />
<br />
We think the decision of when to use a big heal and when to use a small heal is a fun one -- it was fun for players for vanilla and BC. Healing might be too bland if you literally only had those spells, but nobody will. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/24262389900/the-big-medium-small-issue/))<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ipaladins.gif Paladin (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/class-paladin/) / Talent Calculator (http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?paladin))<br />
Paladin Healing model<br />
We talked a lot about keeping the paladin model inverted, where the small heal is super efficient. There is probably a way it could still work. In the end we were just concerned that it would end up biting us in the rear. Somewhere along the way we'd have to make special rules to handle the paladin, who would risk being too mana efficient or too incapable of healing when forced to heal outside of their mana-efficient comfort zone. Could we have designed it? Probably. But frankly I'd rather spend our time on more interesting mechanics and spells. I'd rather the new AE heal really make paladins feel like they can AE heal rather than really making sure FoL felt small, cheap and fast. I agree it erodes a little bit of distinction among the classes, but only a little bit. There are far more interesting ways to make healers feel unique than in the relative mana efficiency of their small spell. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/24262389900/the-big-medium-small-issue/))<br />
<br />
Divine Storm<br />
Divine Storm will get the Whirlwind treatment (less damage per target but unlimited targets).<br />
<br />
The difference is that paladins fit their rotations around cooldowns while warriors do so around a limited resource. So it's entirely possible a paladin will still use DS when other attacks are on cooldown. (It will depend on what exactly the Ret rotation looks like, which we're still developing.) Divine Storm also provides a little healing too, so it's not exactly the same as Whirlwind. We probably wouldn't want to get to the point where Rets feel the need to have their single target spec without DS and the cleave spec with DS. (And without knowing the numbers, it's going to be difficult for any of you to insist that this will or will not happen.)<br />
<br />
In general, we don't want buttons that are good against single targets to just be better against groups of targets. It makes rotations too static and makes numbers hard to balance since &quot;cleavey&quot; specs can do so much more damage against tight packs of enemies. Some higher damage is fine. It just too extreme right now.<br />
<br />
These are previews, not patch notes. Just because we didn't mention anything doesn't mean there is no chance of it changing. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/24262359954/nerfed-ww-but-divine-storm-is-fine/))<br />
<br />
Blessings / Blessing of Sanctuary<br />
Kings and Might can just be raid wide. There should be no need to target individuals. We're trying to make sure there isn't a circumstance where one dude would prefer the opposite buff to everyone else.<br />
<br />
Bo Sanc could just be Kings with an extra mana component (for the paladin). We're also considering making it a passive that gives the paladin mana and provides the 3% damage reduction buff raid-wide which is currently brought by Renewed Hope (the Disc talent). (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/24262370366/blessing-of-sanctuary-cataclysm/))<br />
<br />
Scaling back AoE Tanking Capabilities of Paladins<br />
That's still the goal. I guess I'm unclear of what part of the paladin preview you took to mean that we're keeping the same or even enhancing the ability for paladins to AE tank.<br />
<br />
We tried to stay away from numbers as much as possible in the previews, except to give you a vague sense of the intent for some of the new abilities in terms of whether something has a short cooldown or a long cooldown.<br />
<br />
[...] No, it's not really that. We just have a couple of different avenues we're exploring and we didn't want to have say models A, B and C in different large paragraphs. The ideas just need a little more time to bake.<br />
<br />
And I'm not entirely sure how you're using &quot;niches&quot; but I am talking about wanting Prot paladins to use slightly different rotations against single targets than against groups. The addition of Crusader Strike (and maybe Holy Shock?) alone start to provide that. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/24262389747/what-happened-to-scaling-back-aoe-threat/))<br />
<br />
Critical Healing Effect<br />
There also seems to be some confusion about Critical Healing Effect which simply means a critical heal can do more than 150%. (Think of talents like Ruin for warlocks.) We wanted to keep some of the feel of Holy paladins getting big critical heals and caring about crit in general. This mechanic wouldn’t really have worked in Wrath of the Lich King because big crits just translated into overhealing. In Cataclysm that shouldn’t be the case. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/24261189717/cataclysm-class-preview-paladin/))<br />

Enhancement Concerns<br />
The previews have only been out a short while, and we're not ready to go from there yet to going into a lot of detail on every talent tree. There are some Enhancement mechanics you haven't seen yet.<br />
<br />
To deal with two specific concerns....<br />
<br />
We agree that Enhancement benefits too much from just auto attacking. This isn't a &quot;nerf shaman&quot; issue. We just think having more yellow damage makes the spec more interesting, a little harder to master (in the sense of letting really good players eek out a little more dps) and ultimately easier to balance.<br />
<br />
On the mastery talent tree bonus, it might very well end up as all Elemental damage. We're not really trying to get Enhance to shift from Fire damage to more Lightning Bolts or anything at higher tiers of gear. We didn't go that way initially because it looked odd for Enhancement's bonus to be &quot;Elemental damage&quot; and also because Survival's bonus was also Elemental damage, and we want all 30 to be unique. But there are ways around that, including doing a different one for Survival. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/24262388737/a-collection-of-enhancement-concerns-for-cata/))</div></div><hr />

It's more interesting to see how our single target rotation is going to look like with these changes. If they make DS to an AoE attack, Consecration must be removed from our single target rotation as well. Everything else would be hypocrisy.<br />
<br />
However, this would leave us just with Judgement, CS and Exorcism (+ HoW below 20%). I don't know if it's really a smart plan to remove attacks before even having an idea what to add to make our rotation more interesting. Because Rets do need more strikes to distribute their damage for less burst and hopefully more interaction between them.<br />
<br />
We probably wouldn't want to get to the point where Rets feel the need to have their single target spec without DS and the cleave spec with DS.<br />
So, let me sum up GC's post:<br />
<br />
&quot;We want to make DS an AoE attack, so it shouldn't be used in your single target rotation, but maybe you will still have to use it in your single target rotation.&quot;<br />

<br />
Not sure about the Divine Storm change, since it is a preview after all and we don't know how it will play out.<br />
<br />
They kinda do need to change Prot/Holy play styles, I think its bad when I can tank or heal and be able to space out so much that I spend more time looking at the tv than the computer and there's no problem. That shouldn't even happen to dps, let alone healers or tanks. I'm looking forward to the prot changes and holy seems decent too.</div></div><hr />

He's making the attack a primarily AoE attack, but he also says that since retridins are a cooldown based dps class, there will be times where every attack is on cooldown and it would be beneficial to actually press the aoe attack for more dmg, thus he's going to make sure that it doesn't do ALL TOO LOW dmg on single target.<br />

It's a preview. View it as such. Other abilities will probably be compensated to keep single target damage acceptable while keeping AOE damage from getting out of hand.<br />

Don't pretend to be smarter about the game then the people actuall y DESIGNING it.<br />

Not harder to be smarter than gc dont know who's kid he was to get the job but he has been extremely out of touch with the actual community while just posting bullshit for a while.</div></div><hr />

Problem is that most of the so-called community is out of touch of reality, and see things as black &amp; white where your own character is the center of the universe. I hope this isn't news for you, but you're not an unique snowflake.<br />
<br />
There is no nerf since every fucking number will change in Cataclysm. If normal health of characters goes up by 50-100% it means every single damage source will be re-balanced before the game ships. If one of your precious attacks gets nerfed, it means the other three gets a small buff to balance it out.</div></div><hr />

seeing how they fuck up with uninteresting masteries (+crit ohlolol +holy dmg ohlolol) i am pretty interested in how they screw up the talent trees.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
That was the whole point. Did you read any of what they posted before the previews? Mastery pulls the &quot;boring, uninteresting&quot; stuff out of the talent trees in and puts it in Mastery bonuses. Because Mastery is something you passively get from just spending points in a tree and/or getting Mastery on gear. They're doing exactly what they said they'd do. Mastery bonuses were never supposed to be all that interesting themselves (except the third tier Mastery), they're supposed to free up space in the talents tree for more interesting stuff.</div></div><hr />

I mean both of those abilities are awesome in pvp, outside of raid and in raid. Only reason to change them into button you press once on aoe packs (since in 80% of situations everything will be down before you get ability ready to use again) is because they give too big dmg increase on some fights? <br />
Whats next... nerfing consecration radius cause &quot; it gives too much bonus dmg on some fights?&quot; or perphaps removing pestilence from the game entirely cause it does exactly the same ? <br />
<br />
Fun part is that in post about encounter design he mentions that in some fights some classes are better than others.... <br />
<br />
This is only the beggining of the cataclysm changes and yet blizz already started to discourage me to actually buy it :/ <br />
<br />
<br />
Instead of making bullshit changes like these he should focus on making hybrids equal in terms of utility...<br />
and finally make hybrids like warrs or dk's equal to utility of shamans, paladins or druids...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Other posts seem to suggest that the designers want our abilities to have specialized roles such that you benefit or suffer based on how well you choose what abilities to use in what situations. Given that design plan, it'd make sense to expect a more diverse offensive toolkit for Ret. <br />
Personally, I'm expecting &quot;Holy Strike&quot; as the new 41 point that either has different effects based on your seal or interacts with your other attacks.<br />
<br />
I also wouldn't be surprised if they made HotR baseline as a cleave type ability so that there'd be 'single target', 'few target', and 'multiple target' strike options similar to how healing classes with have &quot;Lesser Heal&quot; &quot;Heal&quot; &quot;Greater Heal&quot;</div></div><hr />

Now, the question is whether it's actually a offensive strike or not. We just don't know how the rotation is going to look like for Paladins. Will they be using builder attacks (a'la original beta)? Will they go to having procs and twitch-striking?<br />
<br />
Ironically, this is the situation with Paladins:<br />
Holy: Has no AOE<br />
Protection: Has too much AOE<br />
Retribution: Has too much AOE<br />
That said, I don't particularly see how Paladins are in any shape or form better at AOE than the other tanking classes, unless we're talking about Undead. I find only the Warriors are worse off and Death Knight AOE tanking is laughably easy. Sure, Paladins may be easy up to 4-5 targets, but after that it's excessively difficult to keep mobs off the dpsers since the abilities are too unpredictable.</div></div><hr />

I play a resto Shaman as well and I was a little sad to hear they were taking out the cleansing totem and it's abilities, but you know what? Life goes on. I'm going to enjoy my cleansing totem while I have it and damn well put it out in every fight it needs to be while I can lol. Maybe in Cataclysm things we'll be mostly magic based, and we will need to cleanse that, and that is why they gave it to everyone. That is just my guess. <br />

<br />
<br />
Q: Any plans to give Fury Warriors more hit from precision or another talent due to the removal of Heroic Strike as&quot;next weapon&quot; hit? <br />
A: Part of the problem is that Fury warriors undervalue hit as it is because of the way Heroic Strike works today. We’ll make sure they do appropriate damage with the new model, but that probably won’t be with a talent that says “I don’t have to worry about getting hit for my gear.” <br />
<br />
Q: Will Protection Warriors have improved AoE tanking in Cataclysm? <br />
A: We will make sure they don’t feel gimp compared to the other 3 tanks. We’re not going to give them an ability that they can just spam endlessly to maintain AE threat. We think Thunder Clap and Shockwave already work well for that. We want you to have to manage threat, but we don’t want it to be insanely hard to manage. (You also might be doing less AE tanking in Cataclysm overall.) <br />
<br />
Q: How will haste affect channeled spells. Will it be similar to DoTs and HoTs? <br />
A: They will channel faster but their duration will remain unchanged. You will get more ticks on the same cast.<br />
<br />
Q: Do you intend to have all 280% flying mounts scale to 310% when a 310% mount is earned, or will only purchased mounts do so? <br />
A: Our current plan, is that in Cataclysm, you can learn a new rank of flying that lets all flying mounts move at 310% (even current 280% mounts). That will probably be as fast as mounts will ever get. We don’t like it that when you get a 310% mount that you stop using your old ones. <br />
<br />
Q: Will healing hands be a paladin-centered tranquility, or something we have to run around to keep people in range of?<br />
A: The idea is that it matters where the paladin is, so it won’t be raid-wide like Tranquility will be in Cataclysm. We will make sure the magnitude of the heal is sufficient that it’s a button the paladin wants to use. The cooldown and duration aren’t set in stone either. <br />
<br />
Q: When does the homogenization of classes stop? Paladins are starting to look like priests. Where is the diversity? <br />
A: We want the challenge of beating PvE encounters or enemy teams in PvP to be how awesome you are at strategizing, not how often you are at recruiting the right classes. While it is very, very important to us for classes to feel different, it’s also very important to us that friends get to play together.</div></div><hr />
