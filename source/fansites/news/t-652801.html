Patch 3.2 - New Argent Tournament Updates<br />
Most of the mounts mentioned in the following posts are already in the current version of the game but aren't available to players:<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/alliance-icon.gif Silver Covenant Hippogryph (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/june/silvercovenanthippogryph.jpg)<br />

http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/horde-icon.gifSunreaver Dragonhawk (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/june/sunreaverdragonhawk.jpg) (A new model has been confirmed for the Dragonhawk, the one in-game isn't the mount) <br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/horde-icon.gifStabled Sunreaver Hawkstrider (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/june/stabledsunreaverhawkstrider.jpg)<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ipaladins.gifStabled Argent Warhorse (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/june/stabledargentwarhorse.jpg) (Possibly the Paladin-only mount)<br />
<br />
With the release of the Secrets of Ulduar, the Argent Tournament opened its doors to heroes from all over Azeroth and saw champions arise from the ranks to take on the challenges before them to prove their worth. In the next upcoming content patch, Call of the Crusade, the Argent Tournament will be expanding its influence and players will be able to experience all-new dailies, rewards, and areas of interest.<br />
<br />
Two New Quest Hubs<br />
A new Cult of the Damned camp now sits overlooking the Tournament grounds and spying on the activity below.<br />
<br />
Located on an island north of Icecrown, the former tuskarr village known as Hrothgar's Landing is a mist-shrouded staging point for Sea Vrykul raids upon the ships of the Silver Covenant and the Sunreavers in the waters between the island and Icecrown.<br />
<br />
New Dailies and Rewards<br />
Just when you thought you had seen and done it all, the Argent Tournament throws out the gauntlet once more and adds a new line of quests and rewards for players who have become exalted with either the Silver Covenant or the Sunreavers. Earn seals by participating in three additional random dailies and earn brand-new rewards.<br />
New Tabards: Alliance characters will be able to earn the Silver Covenant tabard and Horde characters will be able to earn the Sunreaver tabard currently seen being worn by NPCs on the grounds.<br />
New Mounts: New ground and flying mounts will be available for both Horde and Alliance. Alliance will be able to purchase the new Quel'dorei Steed and Silver Covenant Hippogryph. Horde will be able to purchase the new Sunreaver Hawkstrider and Sunreaver Dragonhawk.<br />
New Pet: A brand-new pet, the Shimmering Wyrmling, will be available to characters of both factions who distinguish themselves. <br />
<br />
Argent Crusader Dailies and Rewards<br />
A new line of dailies and rewards for players who have earned the title of Crusader will be available with two random seal-awarding dailies.<br />
New Heirlooms<br />
New Argent Crusade Banner<br />
New Argent Crusade Tabard: Ports you directly to the Tournament grounds.<br />
An Upgraded Squire: As any good squire should, this upgraded squire now has a mount.<br />
New Mount: A new Argent Crusade paladin-only charger will be available. <br />
<br />
The Black Knight Returns<br />
Just when you thought you had seen the last of the Black Knight, he makes his astonishing return to Tournament. Wait, didn’t you kill him?<br />
<br />

Now, daily daily daily...what is this suposed to lead too, having to do 50 dailys insted of 25 next expention?<br />

I doubt you will buy the Dragonhawk with the same seals.<br />
Blizzard would be stupid if they gave people the possibility to buy the greatest reward the day the patch hits live servers...</div></div><hr />

<br />
#1 Horde only being able to get a dragonhawk mount without a 100 mount achievement...(Perhaps makin the dragonhawk a Tournament mount that both factions can buy, and just remake a wyvern for horde, or hell, Bust out a BAT mount...them things only get use in Pre-BC stuff...)<br />
<br />
#2 Hippogryphs still to this day have not had a Landed stance...they just hover...perhaps take 3 mins and make one?<br />
<br />
My views might be considered QQ...but I beleive in fairness to some extent...and #1 seems a bit more fair then what I've read in the notes...Not that I personally can change what blizz will do...I can only suggest and hope...<br />
<br />

Back in Vanilla WoW there were a ton of quests to do after you hit 60 and there was no benefit to doing it other than being a &quot;completest&quot;(it wasn't until patch 1.10.0 that they made the converion to extra gold from exp for max level Characters source (http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/patchnotes/patch1p10.html))<br />
<br />
This game is a game of constant changing. Earlier in the game it was possible to make G from professions, now it isn't as easy. They have dumbed the game down some to make it more appealing to the masses. As a Raider I enjoy the fact that I can do dailys for gold instead of having to farm and troll the AH for the opportunity to find bargains that I can turn around and sell for a profit. I welcome the chance to do different dailys because to be honest it gets old and be honest, do you really do 25 dailys everyday? Would you do 50? Nobody is MAKING you do dailys to begin with. They have put in so many different dailys so that people can spice it up a little.</div></div><hr />

Exactly.<br />
<br />
And since you're making your character stronger, you might as well work on him/her in other ways too, right? That's why achievements are cool, they give your character a bit more depth. Although that kind of sucks for Alt-o-Holics.</div></div><hr />

Good thing i have it already =D.

But seriously, you might as well ask who needs epics. It's a game, it's all just shiny pixels anyway.<br />
<br />
except all monts do the same thing and can't ride more than one at the same time, so do you really need xxx epics which have the exact same stats just different skins ?</div></div><hr />

Oh, come on. It takes 150 badges to buy the upgrade. You can get, what, 6 badges a day at best? Unless you've been saving them up since 3.1 came out, it will take you a month of questing every single day before you can buy this thing.<br />

For that effort, it's a pretty fair trade in my opinion...</div></div><hr />

You still have the option to quest, to do other dailies all around Northrend, to earn money by grinding mobs (oldschool) or NOT doing dailies at all. <br />

We just updated the information about the squire with the following bit.<br />
An Upgraded Squire: As any good squire should, this upgraded squire now has a mount and can be called forth every eight hours for three minutes of duty. The upgrade cost is 150 Champion Seals and your squire will also offer one of three services: bank, mail, or vendor access. <br />

Granted its a bit meh from the 100 mount achievement perspective but its hardly going to be a 'free' mount as it were. <br />
However, it's a bit rich that any class that has a class-specific mount has anything to whine about. Take the druid flight form for instance; herbing whilst in form? instant cast? what is there not to love about that? if you're tired of how it looks, there are plenty of flying mounts to choose from like the other 9 classes have to (disclaimer: cast time included).<br />
And while on the subject, the warlock mount still looks bloody terrific in my opinion. I sure would love to have something similar tailored to fit the sinister nature of my rogue.<br />
<br />
What I really want to ask is: How is it you are getting less because someone, somewhere is getting more?<br />

<br />
And I don't care that alliance gets another hippogryph or that it doesn't land because its the fricken white armored one. The best hippogryph of all. Finally is all I can say, I wanted that mount since the day I first saw it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Plawsky</div><div class="date">2009-06-17, 02:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is to the retards ripping on the Warlocks asking for a mount of their own. Where did they say the Argent Tournament had to be the one to give it out? All the smart ass remarks about the tournament being run by Paladins and being &quot;pure&quot; and all about &quot;the light&quot; are garbage...how about you reread the news update and you would see this...<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't think you understand why they're ripping on Warlocks for asking for a new mount. It's because locks instantly think they deserve a new class mounts just because Paladins got one. Y'all already have a badass mount - why does them getting one mean you get one? You do realize, right, that there are 7 classes that don't have their own mount. I would love if rogues could get their own mount - but it doesn't make sense with the tournament. Blizz still tries to keep some game changes related to lore, and this is one of them. I'm not saying I think Paladins should be getting a mount, I'm just saying there is no reason Warlocks should be.</div></div><hr />

Except that the Silver Covenant Hippogryph hanging out by all the other reward mounts is the one that everybody wanted in the first place, rather than the disappointing one all the flying guards are mounted on.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Most of WoW's focus is on max level gaming. It surprises you that they're trying to get people there a little bit quicker?<br />
<br />
People with the loremaster title will be smiling happily anyways at all the new, un-lore-educated noobs leveling up anyways.</div></div><hr />

so that's what?<br />
<br />
20% + 5% from WG in northrend?<br />
<br />
thats a hell of a lot tbh.<br />
<br />
<br />
Heirlooms and WG do not stack with each other. <br />
<br />
So the maximum increase is 20%.</div></div><hr />

You also have to be Exalted with the Argent Crusade before getting the title &quot;Crusader&quot;.</div></div><hr />

I can definitely see that as a real value in the middle of a raid. I'll start saving up my 150 seals now. Just call your &quot;upgraded&quot; squire to access it all :) <br />
<br />
One question comes to mind: Can the entire raid access the &quot;upgraded&quot; squire when they are called out, or just the person who calls the squire out? My thought would probably lean towards just the person who calls them out. <br />
<br />
All in all, it is still a really cool upgrade!</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
That is actually not the point, the point is that it is a game and everyone enjoys different aspect, some like to raid a lot others like to be doing achievements and others like mounts or pets and so on...<br />
You need to cater to as many ppl as possible to keep the game interesting for as many as possible. This is a good thing.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">velde046</div><div class="date">2009-06-19, 10:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh, come on. It takes 150 badges to buy the upgrade. You can get, what, 6 badges a day at best? Unless you've been saving them up since 3.1 came out, it will take you a month of questing every single day before you can buy this thing.<br />
<br />
For that effort, it's a pretty fair trade in my opinion...<br />
<br />
<br />
Plus the fact that the squire will only do the work for you and not be able to do errands for you. So it isn't nerfing engineering imo. Besides I usually only have the mailbox etc. from engineering up for my own interet, not for others unless they ask nicely...</div></div><hr />
