<br />
This. It's unbelieveable how bad the balance is. The real question is, what they did in beta. Also for example shaman and feral. Those classes were and still are shit. All the feedback in the beta and nothing changed!!<br />
<br />
We are still playing a beta.</div></div><hr />

They buff some traits nerf the others and so on. We are struggling to get specific azerite armour with specific azerite traits and when we get them they nerf that trait and buff another so we have to wait for 1 week again to hope for an azerite armour in the weekly chest.

<br />
It's probably going along with the Galvanizing Spark; that way, Arcane's damage should be better without bis traits but unchanged with them, making us less dependant on Azerite luck. <br />
<br />
All mage specs do need help though. Arcane doesn't bring enough damage for how immobile and inflexible it is, Frost only has burst aoe going for it and its sustained ST is mediocre, and Fire is only useful during the execute phase and its vaunted AoE isn't a thing. I have skipped a few tiers over the years, but the last time I remember being this mediocre was Sunwell :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
As it currently stands, Fire is the worst scaling mage spec with gear so things will not get better with higher ilvl. The cause of that is mostly Pyro hitting like a wet noodle which in turn is causing crit (and along with it the spec's main mechanic) to be greatly undervalued.</div></div><hr />

These are not balancing passes. You balance stuff with 10% changes. A +175% or -60% change means the thing was entirely under/overpowered and that should have been noticed months ago in the Beta.</div></div><hr />

Yea, I'm not arguing that some of the changes are not big. I'm saying they used to straight up ignore the balance problems entirely.

Their plan is to create traits of equivalent power so that you feel as strong using any trait. You should select the traits that will bring you a gameplay you'll like. And so you're supposed to change your talents to make nice gameplay combinason.

The only reason that was ever the case is because they probably didn't have the data points or code to make the necessary changes that would bring the spec up to par. That is no longer the case and they are still shitting the bed worse than ever. NEXT</div></div><hr />

The point is that they will keep on balancing so rather than trying to get the best traits, go get the traits that matches your playstyle better. I thought it was obvious...<br />

Do you hear yourself? What's your point? Are you for real? Let's assume that they will do what you say &quot;traits of equivalent power&quot; Why wouldn't i use the same trait if they are equal in power? But this Utopia of yours is impossible.

as a NON ROGUE player i still cannot comprehend why sub + assa traits need to be workes on becoming usefull / buffed while the (at least in my feeling) least played spec which lacks behind needs traits tuned down.<br />
<br />
Then I suggest as a non-rogue player you don't make judgements based on a class you know nothing about. Outlaw is currently the top rogue spec for AoE. On AoE fights it trashes the other two rogue specs. Not every spec is amazing at single target you know. Some specs are better at AoE. If you don't believe me look at the top parses on Zul and Zek'voz, both add heavy and both dominated by Outlaw. Arms, Havoc and Outlaw are insane AoE specs right now.</div></div><hr />

Then I suggest as a non-rogue player you don't make judgements based on a class you know nothing about. Outlaw is currently the top rogue spec for AoE. On AoE fights it trashes the other two rogue specs. Not every spec is amazing at single target you know. Some specs are better at AoE. If you don't believe me look at the top parses on Zul and Zek'voz, both add heavy and both dominated by Outlaw. Arms, Havoc and Outlaw are insane AoE specs right now.<br />
<br />
i made a mistake by typing sub + assa.<br />
what i ment was:<br />
<br />
ASSA + OUTLAW get dmg +<br />
SUB gets dmg -<br />
<br />
if you would've read the changes and read my post you shouldve noticed the mistake i made. but i guess you are too triggered and busy schooling me about ur class. you dont even realize that if you think about it i was not blaming / whining or as you state JUDGING anything. i was pointing out that the &quot;in my feeling&quot; rarest played spec didnt get a + but a &quot;-&quot;. and THAT I am not able to tell if these are relevant &quot;+&quot; or &quot;-&quot;</div></div><hr />

Are you for real? Let's assume that they will do what you say &quot;traits of equivalent power&quot; Why wouldn't i use the same trait if they are equal in power? But this Utopia of yours is impossible. Now i ask you if there wont be any op trait and all of them are equal what's the point to farm them all? Why not farm only 1? I can't even respond to your idea .<br />
<br />
No I can't hear myself when typing. My point is the period at the end of each line. Yes I exist, otherwise who the hell would have wrote this...<br />
For real I'm somoeone like you who desire to find the best trait for my spec and just farm it. But I also have an IQ high enough to understand the reasons why it wouldnt work and why this utopia cant happen. Because blizzard will keep re balancing things so that players can pick the trait they want because they like them rather than because they are OP.</div></div><hr />
