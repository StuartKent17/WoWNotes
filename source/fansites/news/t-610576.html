<br />
Yesterday i had it confirmed by Nebu, that the 36 Yard range on starfall is a bug, nothing final.<br />
<br />
Also, the base manacost are still in effect, the spells probably just show the costs @lvl 80 ?<br />
<br />
Faerie Fire range is probably a bug as well (though i didn'T report that to nebu up to now :&gt;)<br />
<br />
Flourish is probably an outdated version &gt;.&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
can't comment on other classes right now, but i think that those are just outdated as well<br />

Boo<br />
<br />
*edit*<br />
<br />
If they give us the ability to use Rend in Berserk Stance, then it still might be useful. I was really looking forward to using Bloodbath with 75% dmg increase, then having the mob enrage and getting 4x the dmg on top of that. which would be atleast 1700 bleed dmg.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I hope a bunch more spells are changed back to a fixed amount(as they are now in TBC) instead of a percentage of base mana. (like Psychic Scream for example)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Shamanistic Rage now gives your successful melee attacks a chance to regenerate mana equal to 15% of your attack power. (Old version : mana regeneration equal to 30% of your attack power)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
That's quite the nerf for Shamans. That is a significant talent fairly far down in the talent tree, I think they could have reduced it on a less grandiose scale and been fine.</div></div><hr />

That's mostly outdated alpha talents, which no one cared to report to Nebu. (thus they aren't fixed)<br />

First off. They didn't nerf Maelstrom Weapon, they made it better in fact since it now applies to healing spells aswell as damage spells.<br />
<br />
Second. With the fact Agi and Int will also give AP they had to reduce shamanistic rage proc chance so that it doesn't refund stupid amounts of mana since our AP will go up a fare bit. It's not like mana will be an issue with Enh/Ele spec anyway come level 80. Shamanistic Focus, Mental Quickness and Elemental Focus will mean our shocks and LvB will be very cheap.</div></div><hr />

Dev 2: Brilliant! Make it so!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Maelstrom Weapon now reduces the casting time of any spell by 4/8/12/16/20% when you critically hit with a melee weapon. (Old version : was only affecting Lightning Bolt, Chain Lightning, and Lava Burst)<br />
<br />
That's a buff...<br />
<br />
(/agree with Mygore)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
All this does is force us to stay dependent on water shield even more, making static shock worthless(not that i was ever going to take it in the first place).<br />
<br />
What they really should do to shamanistic rage is drop the % to 8 to 10% and make it so EVERY hit gives mana, no more of this random, oh sorry no procs this time, crap<br />
<br />
we will be trying to fit lavaburst into our rotation now as well as stormstrike on an 8 second timer</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
very true... while arcane looks a bit better, blizzard destroys frost by nerfing ice lance. fire is just laughable as it is now. I mean... living bomb??? some class designer really needs to get replaced.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">topfer</div><div class="date">2008-07-25, 02:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">well folks are right and wrong about the change to shamanistic rage.<br />
<br />
1, the addition of AP from agi isn't going to add *that* much attack power, seeing as we only get 1 point from strength now instead of 2. however, being that we'll all be wearing hunter gear, we'll get a bit of a boost on AP, but not much considering theres no strength at all on it. however, we get int to ap as a talent, so that will make it up.<br />
<br />
overall it's a boost to Ap, but not as crazy as people think, and definitely not 50% more.<br />
<br />
however, even without an elemental subspec, your shocks will be like 200 mana a pop, and thats ever 5-6 seconds. which really isn't that much considering we'll be stacking int more than ever.<br />
<br />
i think considering the duration was already nerfed in half, 15% is probably a bit too much of a nerf. its getting close to not being a 'no brainer' in pve anymore.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Not true if using an Enh/Ele spec then shocks will be super cheap and spell cheap aswell. That along with the fact you don't need to twist totems anymore should mean we will likely not have any mana issues.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They just removed one of the only changes that they made to a frost spell.<br />
<br />
I'm glad that the arcane tree will be more viable to go deep in, not only as a support tree, but it was already the highest single-target dps tree, and they still buffing it?!<br />
<br />
What I see right now is what's probably going to happen for the mage:<br />
Arcane : PvE Specc.<br />
Fire * * : AoE Specc.<br />
Frost * : PvP Specc.<br />
Customize to your own wish, but it's the main orientation...<br />
<br />
I understand and agree that you should'nt be as effective using a PvE specc for PvP, as a pure PvP specc would be, same thing for the opposite(PvP specc going for PvE). But since mages only have DPS TREES, is it asking too much to have more than 1 viable specc for PvE?<br />
<br />
Yeah, Winter's Grasp will be good for frost specc, if raid bosses arent immune, but well... for now, a good arcane build's beating all PvE specc for pure dps, except maybe on longer fights, and its the only specc that is getting a PvE single-target buff... (And what a buff... Only the 6% passive spell haste is a uber one, it means around 100 free spell hast rating.)<br />
<br />
I love to raid as a frost specc, for the survivability, and the dps can still compete with end games arcane or fire mages in most of TBC raids, but I think it would be a great thing to throw away e-sport-wow for a few minutes, and look at the mage's tree a bit, for this PvE-oriented-game.<br />

You just ignore the fact, that beta has only been running for a week, that there is more than 1 class the classteam has to work on, that there are still 3-4 Months of beta ahead, that there wasn't a beta patch up to now (Nebu doesn't get all thing changed to the calcs immediately, that's just impossible for him alone, so he will miss some, therefore we have to wait for beta to get patched to see all the changes &gt;.&gt;)...<br />

Arcane<br />
Arcane Impact is now called Spell Impact and increases the critical strike chance of Arcane Explosion, Arcane Blast, Blast Wave, Fire Blast, Ice Lance, and Cone of Cold by 2/4/6% (Old version : Was only affecting Arcane Explosion / Arcane Blast)<br />
New Talent - Student of the Mind (Tier 3) - Increases your total spirit by 4/8/12%<br />
Arcane Potency now requires 1 Point in Presence of Mind instead of 5 points in Arcane Concentration<br />
Potent Spirit has been removed<br />
New Talent - Arcane Flows (Tier 8, requires 1 point in Arcane Power) - Reduces the cooldown of your Presence of Mind, Arcane Power, and Invisibility spells by 30 secs.<br />
Netherwind Presence now increases your spell haste by 2/4/6% (Old version : Gives your Arcane Missiles, Arcane Barrage, Arcane Blast, Fireball, Frostbolt, and Forstfire Bolt spells a 1/2/3/4/5% chance to cause the next Arcane Blast, Fireball, Frostbolt or Frostfire Bolt to be instant.)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Frost<br />
Arctic Reach doesn't influence Ice Lance anymore<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ishamans.gif Shaman<br />
Elemental<br />
Convection (Tier 1) is now a 3 points talent, reducing the mana cost of Shock, Lightning Bolt, Chain Lightning, Thunder and Lava Burst spells by 4%/8%/12% (Old version : 5 points and 2/4/6/8/10%)<br />
Concussion doesn't affect Lava Burst and Thunderstorm anymore.<br />
Storm Reach now also increases the radius of your Thunderstorm spell by 10% along with the range improvement on Lightning Bolt / Chain Lightning.<br />
Elemental precision increases your chance to hit with Fire, Frost, and Nature spells by 2/4/6% and reduces the threat caused by these spells by 4/7/10% (Old version : 1/2/3% hit and 10/20/30% threat)<br />
Astral Shift now has a 33/66/100% chance to shift into the Astral Plane reducing all damage taken by 30% (Old version : 100% chance to reduce all damage taken by 10%/20%/30%) <br />
Thunderstorm range increased from 10 to 12 yards, damage increased from 595-679 to 640-729, knockback stays 20 yards. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Enhancement<br />
Improved shields now increases the amount of Mana Shield orbs by 10% instead of 5%, improvements to Lightning Shield and Earth Shield stay the same.<br />
Shamanistic Rage now gives your successful melee attacks a chance to regenerate mana equal to 15% of your attack power. (Old version : mana regeneration equal to 30% of your attack power)<br />
Maelstrom Weapon now reduces the casting time of any spell by 4/8/12/16/20% when you critically hit with a melee weapon. (Old version : was only affecting Lightning Bolt, Chain Lightning, and Lava Burst)<br />
Feral Spirit now lasts 45 seconds instead of 30 seconds. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Meh, I'm a Pyromaniac, I don't really have much care for how much they are putting into Arcane as I like the fire tree and spells, and, we're going to Northrend, a continent mainly covered in ice...<br />
<br />
Shaman tho...<br />
Well, it couldn' last.<br />
<br />
Elemental Precision put back to the TBC version, 30% threat reduction I guess was too good to look forward to. Concussion effect removed, Lava Burst I can see as it gains damage from Call of Flame. Wondering about that Storm Reach note, as it already gives 6 yards on LB and CL, tho the TS means 13.1 yards instead of 12... yay ::)<br />
Enh: Not really my thing, tho I know someone that may enjoy those changes, or not.</div></div><hr />

Holy Shield will now give you 6 charges instead of 4. <br />

So, will improved holy shield bring us to a total of 10 charges?<br />
This might be better for our AoE tanking, but I think we're past the idea of being crushing immune. Still, two more charges. Woo?</div></div><hr />

Subtlety<br />
Fixed a typo in Honor Amongst Thieves, now gives a 10/20/30% to gain a combo point when you or someone in your group critically hits with a damage, healing, or spell ability. (Was ... 100/200/300%)<br />

Imagine activating trinket+Combustion, dropping a Flamestrike on a group of mobs, then start the Living Bomb as you run to them, Dragon Breath just before entering the pack to stun them, then Blastwave, at that point Living Bomb will explode.

Note that Living Bomb is very, very cool - you can run around and/or cast other things while it is ticking down and it is less aggro than casting a Flamestrike on the same mobs. Blazing Speed might work well with running away from mobs while it is ticking.</div></div><hr />

^^^ = death wish for fire mages. That combo would be ok if mages had like a 6 second defensive shield that would keep them from taking damage or something (I know, would never happen, not asking for it either), otherwise DB, BW, LB are all basically melee range AoE. It would go something along the lines of flamestrike, LB, DB, BW, Death, graveyard run. Locks with their SoC would just be sitting back at range, watching fire mages get owned.<br />

No it won't, and I seriously doubt it's meant to. Going by how the Paladin is evolving it seems that the Retribution PvP tendency will be going towards support and damage rather than debuffs - translated that means you're not meant to be teaming up with healers (also, world and BG PvP isn't about duels as much as zerging it up)</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pyrostemplar</div><div class="date">2008-07-26, 09:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Imagine activating trinket+Combustion, dropping a Flamestrike on a group of mobs, then start the Living Bomb as you run to them, Dragon Breath just before entering the pack to stun them, then Blastwave, at that point Living Bomb will explode. If anything is still standing, Frost Nova and one or two more Flamestrikes should take care of it.<br />
<br />
Note that Living Bomb is very, very cool - you can run around and/or cast other things while it is ticking down and it is less aggro than casting a Flamestrike on the same mobs. Blazing Speed might work well with running away from mobs while it is ticking.<br />
<br />
<br />
Living bomb is absolute crap atm for a 51 pointer - ridiculous damage and a 7% dmg scaling. Anyway Flamestrike is only usable if somone is tanking the mobs - your frost nova would be useless and the mage would be clobbered. Basically my conclusion is that you never AOEd with a mage - it doesn't work like that.<br />
<br />
You may use Flamestrike if you have a pal tank - still crap dmg and radius, sometimes usable though. Then you can go and 1st use BW then DB (sometimes the other way around, depending on the mob physical distribution). But then on is the best mage AOE and the only one that really makes them good at AOE - Arcane explosion - our spammable &quot;AOE on the move&quot; with a threat modifier.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Improved Icy Touch has changed completely. Specc'd it'll be back to close to the dmg it was in alpha<br />
Nerves of Cold Steel is now much more accessible (Tier 2).<br />
Annihilation has been moved all the way up to Tier 3.<br />
Aneurysm has been moved up to Tier 7.<br />
Blood of the North appears to be an all-new Talent that grants Death Runes. To offset the high number of frost runes needed to be a Frost Knight, but in-ability to change your rune set-up from 2/2/2<br />
Frost Aura also appears to have been buffed dramatically, in terms of Frost Resistance.<br />
Frost Strike is now a standalone Talent.</div></div><hr />

That combo would be ok if mages had like a 6 second defensive shield that would keep them from taking damage or something (I know, would never happen, not asking for it either), otherwise DB, BW, LB are all basically melee range AoE. It would go something along the lines of flamestrike, LB, DB, BW, Death, graveyard run. Locks with their SoC would just be sitting back at range, watching fire mages get owned.<br />
<br />
I agree with you about what blizz is trying to do with the three trees though, think you hit that on the head.<br />
<br />
<br />
Could be a use for Shatter Shield then.</div></div><hr />

You just ignore the fact, that beta has only been running for a week, that there is more than 1 class the classteam has to work on, that there are still 3-4 Months of beta ahead, that there wasn't a beta patch up to now (Nebu doesn't get all thing changed to the calcs immediately, that's just impossible for him alone, so he will miss some, therefore we have to wait for beta to get patched to see all the changes &gt;.&gt;)...<br />
<br />
But at least that confirms one thing for me: you guy's are incredible stupid :&lt;<br />
<br />
<br />
What you dont understand is mages repeatedly get the shaft why cant we be truly op for a week that would be nice but no they seem to be afraid of making us op so purposely half a** our spells look at base damage for fireball and then look at pyro blast which is a talent i dont want to hear it about the DoT unless it stacks its pointless</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Swift Retribution Rank 3 <br />
<br />
Your Retribution Aura also increases casting, ranged and melee attack speeds by 3%. <br />
...<br />
<br />
2 Ret pallies are not needed to get the increase in haste and the 2% dmg. increase. <br />

I myself..am a ret pally...and also think 2 per 25 an raid will be nice now....but its not needed to get the full buffs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
nah, I don't want anything, was just saying that dps increase for shadows won't make them OP - they are OP in TBC cause of 5% VT return, not dps numbers... you need a very large boost to make a 1600dps(ok, 1800 after talent changes...) shadow with 2% VT compare to 2500+ dps from pure dpsers... <br />
and 2 holy+ 3 shadows(with 2/2 VE :P ) was on our first brut kill - clearly OP class... <br />
And now shadow is a ret spec for priests...<br />
<br />
I like priest changes, if holy tree makes into the game as is, I'll enjoy healing wotlk. Cause when every caster, but lock, needs a shadow to be viable... its just broken.</div></div><hr />
