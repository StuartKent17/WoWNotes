New WoW TV Spots<br />
With the Warlords of Draenor release only a few weeks away, Blizzard has shared four of the commercials you may see soon.<br />

Behind the Scenes of Lords of War...<br />
The road to The Dark Portal is paved with good intentions (http://img2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20090711231308/wowwiki/images/5/55/Path_of_Glory_-_Close-up.jpg).<br />
<br />
I wasn't implying the Iron Horde was responsible for the Path of Glory in Outland, but rather the Iron Horde's intentions (as far as they're concerned) aren't &quot;evil&quot;; their redemption is just misguided. The clans of the Iron Horde have been beaten down, oppressed, tortured, and marginalized, and one day a slick orc walks in with amazing technology and great power, telling them of a glorious future where they take back their honor and rule as conquerors of an entire planet. As repugnant as their actions ultimately are, those aren't intentions fueled purely by some ultimate evil. Which to me makes them far more interesting from a story perspective. Don't be fooled, these guys are bad, but not in the strict sense of the word. They have motivations, and intentions, and those are shaped by their experiences. Enemies that aren't just brainlessly evil is pretty cool, if not uncomfortably realistic.<br />
<br />
The Iron Horde have been set down a very dark path, and there's no sign of them veering from it. To make the wrongs against them right, they will pave a road with the bones of whoever oppose them, demon blood or not.

Blue Tweets<br />
Classes<br />
Since Warriors kinda underwhelming visually attack side, glyph to make Whirlwind all fiery and such? Fits with theme, I'd say.<br />
We don't disagree, it's a hot topic of discussion, many classic wow classes could use a visual overhaul. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/524967539923619840))<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/iwarlocks.gif Warlock (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/277-Warlock) / Skills (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/warlock) / Talent Calculator (http://www.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#k))<br />
any plans on buffing Warlock? After the last &quot;hotfix&quot; they are at the bottom dps at 100 (with all specs).<br />
We'll adjust tuning as necessary at 100. We did a pass at 90 because it was too significantly off to leave for a month. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/524415598957064193))<br />
<br />
Art<br />
So I got excited about garrisons enchant transmoging but then realised I'm a hunter.. any solution?<br />
Not immediately, but it's on our radar for sure. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/524654316359917569))<br />
<br />
PvE<br />
What changes besides dmg squish was Spine of Deathwing supposed to get that would make it easier to solo? They already in?<br />
He takes twice as long to roll if you are solo. Much easier to dance back and forth. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/524634458154991617))<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
for example, i queue with friend in skirmish. he leaves arena, i have to leave arena to requeue with him.<br />
The functionality of the button is to queue people still in the arena. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/524590695257239553))<br />
<br />
with a 50% win rate, doesn't 200-250 skirmishes seem a bit much for one piece of gear? With healers, the games can be real long.<br />
You get more honor if the game goes longer. But longer games are still less efficient. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/524595390143021056))<br />
<br />
Can you confirm if there will be an honor wipe with Wod coming out?<br />
We don't plan on wiping honor. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/524595444757061633))<br />
<br />
Is there an official start date for season 16 (warlords season1)? Wondering if I can get conquest gear before raids unlock.<br />
Season starts the same day raids open (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/524701493950025729))<br />
<br />
Lore<br />
I think the plague is slightly hidden and too small to be seen, put some flowers and weapons around it!<br />
Nazgrim's axe maybe? (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/524653648047898624))<br />
<br />
Will we be seeing Sky Admiral Rogers again in a later patch? She is awesome.<br />
We like her and want to use her again. No word on when or where. (_DonAdams (https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/524706791527944192))<br />
<br />
World<br />
Why do those weather stones need the limited charges? Going back to the isle to grind ain't fun.<br />
Things that affect how others see the world are often limited to preserve the world (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/524656984587374592))<br />
<br />
Will the alliance get more candy buckets next year since they have 5 less than the horde now? Need more candy next year.<br />
Will investigate, thanks! (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/525012985383628800))<br />
<br />
Garrisons<br />
Thanks ! So can those Leatherworking tents be used on old continents and will there be new faction tents coming?<br />
The time limit is relatively short because they are fairly large and obstructive. We'll look into a use-anywhere one. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/524655839437537280))<br />
<br />
Garrison enhancement suggestion: An actual toy box that becomes more impressive as you fill it with more toys. <br />
Might be cool to let you summon it as a toy anywhere, and ppl can click on it to get a random toy effect? Will consider. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/524656201166888960))<br />
<br />
Are nameable garrison followers still a possibility for a WoD patch? My sister had lists of names ready, haha.<br />
Unfortunately, no, they have pretty extensive backstories and it would be weird to be able to force re-name them (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/524656377604489216))<br />
<br />
There doesn't seem to be any difference between doing a mission with 600ilvl follower or 650. Intended?<br />
You should see an increase in the change to obtain loot from that mission, are you not seeing that? The bonus loot % (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/524657702853545984))<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sisren</div><div class="date">2014-10-26, 10:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Personally, I think the Grommash Death Stare is the best one. It's more of a teaser than a commercial, and is pretty obviously for current fans and players of WoW. I see it as more of a Youtube advert than a TV spot, though.<br />
<br />
The rest are just rehashed from the cinematic. Boring and uninformative since the game itself is nothing like the cinematic (true for the majority of games in general).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Maybe not cheesy but it will definitely fool quite some people thinking it looks like that, which is never good.</div></div><hr />

<br />
#2 was the best out of that lot, but it needed to be longer.<br />
#3 was choppy and #4 was simply a shorter version of #3.<br />
#1 was the worst because it isn't an actual advertisement, it's just a teaser. And a bore of one at that.<br />
<br />
<br />
That's my opinion on them.<br />
<br />
<br />

Am I missing something or have games not used Cinematics since... I don't know... ever?! Who the hell bases their game purchases on the Cinematic? Even at 12 years old I knew the original World of Warcraft Cinematic was no was the actual game would look. Come on guy.</div></div><hr />

The whole boosted 90 thing is really only appealing to former players, but so many of them are so jaded right now it hardly makes sense why they would promote that feature... there was a reason they left. A catchup mechanism, I get it, but why is this the big feature? If you had never bought the game before, a boosted 90 makes no sense. Why not splash all the other features of the actual game? Actual game graphics demonstrating updates, new content, zones, a reason to really spend the $50. They could appeal to half the former players just showing that it's a return to Draenor since so many people were in love with TBC as the best expansion.<br />
<br />
I dunno, I work in this arena so when I see the only feature being &quot;Boosted 90&quot; it makes me wonder who's doing their marketing. &quot;Give em 10-20 seconds of the cinematic that's been up on Youtube all summer, and then 5 seconds about one of the lesser cared about features of the game.&quot; Really phoned in. I'm a fan of the game, just not the current approaches towards building it up.</div></div><hr />

How is that any different from any other game that does this? LOTS of games use CG for trailers/commercials, if people think that's what the gameplay looks like it's their own fault for buying a game based just off a commercial without doing more research.</div></div><hr />

I was about to say about the same thing. The ads are very misleading and even if they are blatantly faking the graphics fidelity of WoW, it's still just pigmen talking, to the average person that hasn't into WoW or PC gaming in general. <br />

You don't put features in a commercial. No one's going to know what the commercial is talking about.<br />

No one knows what that is. In a commercial you show what &quot;common sense&quot; tells people they know.<br />

Fighting monsters and slow motion movements is what people know and enjoy.<br />

<br />
I don't think people are that stupid to buy a game without doing research (some advertisments just don't work this way). And it is created as a teaser, to get the attention of people. The rest is explained either in the store (they can look at the back of the pack and see the shitty graphics) or online when they are clicking through the store etc. I am totaly not surprised to use the cinematics as a comercial. It's the biggest eye catcher, there are explosions, it's dark there is cool music and grim voice acting. A typical reaction from a potential consumer would be -&gt; &quot;HOLY SHIT this game looks awesome, let's check it out..&quot; (Even people who buy every shit that's on TV usualy research).<br />

Was thinking about that... Can't they be sued for not showing the actual gameplay AT ALL? None of the comercials had the gameplay, just the CGs. Maybe they are that desperate and think people wouldnt buy the game if they showed how it looks for real.

The commercials do look Orc-centric, without context, however I'd imagine that's what sells -rather than Alliance -on short TV spots to the uninitiated.<br />
