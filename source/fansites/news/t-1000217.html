[b]Masks are now sold by vendors<br />
The masks required for A Mask for All Occasions (http://db.mmo-champion.com/a/284/a-mask-for-all-occasions/) are now sold by a vendor, it will obviously make the achievement considerably easier now that all you need to get a mask is 2 x Tricky Treat (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/33226/tricky-treat/)<br />

Feline Familiar, Creepy Crate and Little Wickerman<br />
The new Feline Familiar (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/70908/feline-familiar/) companion pet and Little Wickerman (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/70722/little-wickerman/) are available from vendors for 150 x Tricky Treat (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/33226/tricky-treat/) each!<br />
<br />
It also seems that a new quest chain is available in Stormwind/Orgrimmar Inns, completing it will reward you with a nice Creepy Crate (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/71076/creepy-crate/)!<br />

No one says you have to do it, it's not even linked to the meta. The new way isn't any more &quot;fun&quot; anyway.</div></div><hr />

Oh I know, but it used to be linked. It took some people years to get them all, mainly because of bad RNG and not able to click the bucket 20 times a day.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, because the Night Elves love for Naga and The Vrykul love for Humans are well known. Hell, Trolls love for Naga and Murloc too... Yeah, they totally fit the factions.<br />

They took it off the meta because it was stupid difficult to get, especially when the first year it mattered they didn't have the masks drop in the daily bags from the HH, and the years after the event always started off not working properly and the masks still didn't appear until a week into it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, firstly, you can enjoy the older date on your achievement to prove you did it the hard way.<br />
Secondly, if you had a rotation going with friends (which I can only assume means you were logging in as each other), then you broke the ToS to get your achievement anyway. That kind of activity being necessary to complete an RNG achievement is kinda crazy.</div></div><hr />

Exactly the same feeling :/ Set an alarm for hourly trick-or-treating just so I wouldn't miss a cd, was down to one single mask for a whole year, and got it 3 hours before the event was over. In before flaming, but since it's not part of the meta achievement, I kinda wish they would leave at least *some* of the &quot;chance&quot; holiday achievements as is.

LOL at everyone who thinks the mask achieve was owed to them because they've been unlucky. I myself had NOT gotten it yet, but you know what? I was looking forward to getting it the hard way and the sense of...lucky or not...ACHIEVEMENT. They are called achievement points guys...some take alot more skill than others...but straight buying them is stupid. Oh noes, you can't have every achievement point available at this moment so you might die. And those who use the 'i have a life and career', great, then don't act like you need the achievements to fulfill it. It's not an absolutely horrible thing that those who have a bit more time to spend can get a thing or two...and hell it didn't even have a reward. Your money and successful career should make up for the lack of 10 achievement points right? When a boss refuses to drop that piece of loot you really want, or you don't have time to raid...should blizzard eventually just sell it to you, because you 'have a life and career'?

It looks like every innkeeper has a candy bucket nearby, not just the ones listed in the achievements. Going by Wowhead, Horde has 124 Innkeepers (alliance has 125). Each bucket gives 2 or 3 treats so it shouldn't be too hard (just time consuming) to get enough for both.</div></div><hr />

Was SOOO bothered about the cat until someone mentioned it follows you on a broom while flying which is about the sweetest thing ever :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
So you're telling me that if you bought a lottery ticket every single day and after 22 years you finally won...you wouldn't feel like you accomplished anything? That your diligence finally paid off? And for those who feel 'screw that no lifer who logged in every hour'....i think i'll punch the guy in front of me who can afford to blow $10 on lottery tickets when i can only have one, since it isn't fair.</div></div><hr />

Could you elaborate on this? I see lots of people commenting in various places that there are &quot;extra candy buckets&quot; but I have yet to find a single one horde side.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Add to that the fact that one-handed weapons SUCK for hunters regardless. A pair of one-handers has a lot fewer stats than a similar level twohanded weapon, on top of that there is no enchant for one-handers that even remotely compares to 130 agility for two-handers.<br />
<br />
The agility sword from the event IS only suitable for combat rogues. Even if a hunter is lucky enough to get two of them to drop and the expertise was changed into a useful stat, any 346 polearm or staff with agility will be significantly better.</div></div><hr />

<br />
just asking...<br />
<br />
Shouldnt it be, WTF is a meter? Blizzard is in the U.S. and here, we use inches, feet, yards. A yard is 3 feet long which is 36 inches long.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Meter is standart unit used in science, 1m = 100cm = 10dm, 1km = 1000m, speed of light is 300.000km per second. Rest of world moved on to mesure unit that makes sence, there are only 2 or 3 countries using old system, 1 is USA, other 2 are in Africa. Just sayin'.</div></div><hr />

I was missing one mask (then they added 4 new, but never mind that). I logged in every hour to &quot;Trick or Treat&quot; an inn keeper. I was expecting to get it this year, and I did. But so does everyone else now.<br />
<br />
Why, why, why, can't somethings, even simple things, require some time and effort? Geez... It saddens me, a lot.</div></div><hr />
