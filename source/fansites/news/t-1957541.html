Epic Battle Pet Stones in Legion<br />
Hi everyone!<br />
<br />
First and foremost, thank you very much for testing pet battles in the Legion Alpha. We’ve heard your concerns and have decided not to move forward with epic pet battle stones in Legion.<br />
<br />
To explain a bit about how we arrived at this point--<br />
<br />
When designing rewards for the new battle pet features in Legion and the revamped pet store in Dalaran, we considered epic stones a potential direction to go. Some players are nearing the cap of max-level, all-rare pet teams, and we wanted to see if this space would satisfy their needs for a long-term future level of investment. <br />
<br />
You have correctly identified a few of the issues that come up with this feature:<br />
<br />
New players now have a harder time catching up (though we could mitigate this by speeding up the early leveling process). Players with 600+ rare pets that felt as if they were nearing completion of their pet journal are back to having 600+ pets to level. Power Creep – older content is now easier, future content is harder for new players entering pet battles.<br />
<br />
One of the things we like about pet battles is that much of the early content stays relevant through all of the expansions. Similarly, the collection aspect of battle pets works well when it’s wider (more pets to collect, more variety in abilities) rather than taller (more levels). Both of these are very good reasons to avoid adding epic pet stones.<br />
<br />
This direction also pushes us to create content that tests max-level-pet-battlers in a way that is not purely numbers, but use of abilities, use of specific pets, and memorization of enemy strategies. The Celestial Tournament was a good example of pet battle content that rewarded a varied and filled pet stable. We have some exciting things in mind for future battles versus tamers!<br />
<br />
It’s worth noting that this feature was not intended to replace any gameplay content. We’re working on all sorts of pet battle updates that we’d like to make in future patches. <br />
<br />
Thanks again for all of your feedback. We really appreciate your great ideas and discussion!<br />
<br />

Blue Tweets<br />
people want their classes to have burst aoe because of how fights end up on farm, 1 second lived adds, will legion change this?<br />
Is performance on farm more or less important than performance on progression? (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/702185257286504449))<br />
<br />
<br />
Ghostcrawler Tweets<br />
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br />
Would you say that participiation was low because ToC released too soon, or not many tried it properly?<br />
Players were really spread out. Some couldn't beat the first boss and others were done. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/702158160539181056))<br />
Previously only the done players would move on to the next tier. ToC began everyone moving up, maybe not finishing (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/702158397865472000))<br />
<br />
At what point do you just say &quot;if you hate that role, you're playing the wrong class?&quot; SP's were always like that.<br />
Back in the day, rerolling was not easy and players had a connection to their main. Saying they chose poorly was harsh. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/702158691068305408))<br />

Its obvious... almost always these questions are stupid as hell, and here we go again...<br />
The answer is only obvious... do you really care about farm that much? i dont... progression is what matters and the game should be balanced upon. :P</div></div><hr />

The answer is only obvious... do you really care about farm that much? i dont... progression is what matters and the game should be balanced upon. :P<br />
<br />
Well to be honest no. Progression is certainly important but there comes a point where some classes continue to excel and others plateau or even go backwards based on encounter make up and I feel its important to take this into consideration.<br />
<br />
Eg. lets take a fight that has a few adds here or there that are required to be killed as a priority. During progression and low gear a dot spec is just as useful as a direct damage spec in that both specs have abilities that contribute to the kill.<br />
<br />
Weeks or months later (depending on how scaling goes) You might find that a dot class is looking rather pathetic simply because the add is being killed faster than the dots can do their job. Even if you are 100% aware that this is just what happens, it still feels rather crappy to be that player. <br />
<br />
Now in today's game its possible that you have another dps spec to change too, but in Legion it certainly seems rather difficult to move from your &quot;garbage&quot; spec to your &quot;viable&quot; spec.</div></div><hr />

You progress, then you go to farm after you complete all. If you dont care about your farm much, and not attend raids anymore -<br />
1. you get replaced/gkickd. <br />
2. you perform bad, and get bad logs, and get replaced later.<br />
<br />
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;3. after you dont have guild anymore, you cant join new with same progress, because your logs suck.<br />
<br />
Yes, i care about farm as much as progress.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I hope they invent a new way to upgrade pets to epic, it should be an accomplishment rather than a necessity I feel. Seeing as they are worried people will be going 'oh no 600+ pets to upgrade again!' they need to figure something out that makes people happy, but they can't take away the whole epic thing now they've mentioned it, I was looking forward too much to making my Baby Blizzard Bear epic, cos he was one of my first team I got to 25 =p <br />
<br />
I personally wouldn't mind daily quests, or even so they did it that you have to battle other epic pets MoP style in order to get Epic EXP to gradually level them to epic. I dunno, but I don't want the concept to be given up on. Any pet lovers who get me on this? :P</div></div><hr />

if you got kicked because of point 2, then your guild sucks and your raid leader sucks, he needs to l2p and you need to join a better guild than understand how raiding works.<br />

<br />
Not to mention it's extremely hard to balance everyone on farm, because certain classes just scale a lot better when the fights become shorter, because their extended burst sadly enough accounts for the majority of the fight duration, whereas on progression it wouldn't even account for 1/10th of the duration.</div></div><hr />

Aw, no epic pets :(<br />
<br />
I'm happy with that. I have over 700 blue level 25 pets. It was a pain in the ass to level them all and turn all blue. One expansion wouldn't be enough time to level them all to epic and level 30 or whatever the new cap would have been. Or they need to make it so easy, it's pointless.</div></div><hr />

no they keep their eye on what is healthy for the game as a whole, not what we think is awesome or cool or convenient because of personal preference.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You forget that you then get NEW(as in different looks etc.) gear, that you get MASSIVE new content, that your abilities etc. get changed and you get a whole new tier...etc. etc. etc.. Nobody would complain about getting an epic stone if it would be the bonus loot of new thrilling content. That's not what this was about. Imagine in Legion you would have to run through all the raid content of WoD again(and only that) where just the bosses have little tweaked abilities and as a reward you get the same gear with 5% higher stats....THAT is compareable to the idea of epic stones. You are trying to compare apples and oranges.....not working.</div></div><hr />

From a personal standpoint, if legion isnt challenging enough for me, i am out. For the time being, i already unsubbed and am just playing other mmo's and games. <br />

A few of the achievements added in WoD are a huge grind for a reward that is not so interesting. One of the main reason most people do it is they love to feel things are complete. If Blizzard were to add actual interesting rewards that you can show off and stand out a bit for different pet related achievements, that's all I feel would be needed. As pet battles stand, they are boring.</div></div><hr />

What about questing to gain reputation with new pet masters and once you become exalted you give to him ONE pet and he will &quot;train&quot; it for you during 1 mont. After that month your pet will be top lvl and top attributes, may be you can chose those attributes.<br />
Just an idea of what could be a good reward. Of course, gettin exalted must be painful and time costing, maybe each master gives dif attributes, just saying. Then you chose the master to level repu.<br />
<br />
Maybe... Just dreaming...</div></div><hr />

Raid balancing is tweaked such that it isn't massive which spec you use, while open world farming can vary quite a bit. You simply do par in the raid, keep your spot and with more efficient farming you can save up for that mount or simply have to spend less time farming for mats to enchant your gear. This is a major reason why many people don't like the healer spec: it has gotten better, but your gear isn't as good at farming as someone who just takes their raid dps or tank gear instead.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Bullsh*t. We've been running the same content since Wrath with a new coat of paint. Don't stand in the fire, soak the large hits with a block, keep the HoTs rolling. Any &quot;progress&quot; that raiders have made is through their ilvl which gets reset every xpac. The bosses might have a shiny new model and /yell new dialogue, but we all know it's going to be the same song and dance once again.<br />
<br />
Legion will be no different for pet collectors. We'll get 40-60 new pets, 3 of which might be useful against a single daily quest. The vast majority will be useless fillers, because Blizzard won't put in the effort required to make it as involved and in depth as Pokemon. Until they add breeding and the ability to learn new moves, there's no real challenge involved. (Which is why you only see the same 10~ pets in PVP.) Zeppelin decoy, Howlbomb, gg.<br />
<br />
The only reason people complain now is because they're happy with their sense of &quot;completion&quot;, as if it isn't already completely arbitrary.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Eg. lets take a fight that has a few adds here or there that are required to be killed as a priority. During progression and low gear a dot spec is just as useful as a direct damage spec in that both specs have abilities that contribute to the kill.<br />
<br />
Weeks or months later (depending on how scaling goes) You might find that a dot class is looking rather pathetic simply because the add is being killed faster than the dots can do their job. Even if you are 100% aware that this is just what happens, it still feels rather crappy to be that player. <br />
<br />
Now in today's game its possible that you have another dps spec to change too, but in Legion it certainly seems rather difficult to move from your &quot;garbage&quot; spec to your &quot;viable&quot; spec.<br />
<br />
100% know what you mean. Shadow priest is currently ridiculous. At the point of current over gearing if you spec into AS, adds almost always die too fast for it to be viable. If you then try to spec into cop you then lose most of your add damage and have very poor target switching. Combine this with a mediocre guild then you just have no middle ground because if you play cop you'll be forced to tunnel or do bad damage, and if you go AS you'll do bad damage regardless.</div></div><hr />

Well, can't help you there if you are that delusional. If you think that your char plays the same like in wrath and that you still fight the same bosses with different colors then all I can tell you that it's only like that in YOUR head. Yes, there will always be mechanics that repeat...after all it's about inflicting damage, avoiding damage and healing. There has to be a reason to bring a tank along...and a healer...so...<br />
If you claim that all fights are the same then I wonder why you play games at all. I mean, afterall they are just bits and bytes...and you use a mouse and/or a keyboard. If you come up with comparisons at least make them compareable...and don't try such a failed generalisation.</div></div><hr />

It only feels crappy if you are a sad dps whore (aka noob). If you are a mlg pro like a friend of mine (affliction warlock) you are happy because you can tunnel the boss since adds die without your help. This is all what farm is. <br />
<br />
Take kormrok for example. I had to go combat during progress to kill the hands fast enough (i main a rogue) but during farm I stay subtlety. I could do more &quot;OMG DEEPZZ&quot; as combat but subtlety does tons more damage on the boss and we don't really need more help on the hands anymore. You see the difference between a sad noob like you and a team player like me? You are sad because you are not top on meters, im happy because the boss dies faster even though im not even top 5 as a rogue.</div></div><hr />

The answer is only obvious... do you really care about farm that much? i dont... progression is what matters and the game should be balanced upon. :P<br />
<br />
Yeah, he has a point. People do care about the most random and unimportant shit. I actually think that most of the return-questions I read are quite good questions. If anything they make the hysterical fanbase looks stupid.<br />
I think those are the questions they are discussing behind the scenes. While I don't agree with all their decisions, those tweets make me laugh quite often. It's like calling people out on their &quot;specialness&quot; without them even realizing. Comedy gold. It's one of the only things on mmo-c frontpage that I read these days.</div></div><hr />

1. you get replaced/gkickd. <br />
2. you perform bad, and get bad logs, and get replaced later.<br />
<br />
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;3. after you dont have guild anymore, you cant join new with same progress, because your logs suck.<br />
<br />
Yes, i care about farm as much as progress.<br />
<br />
jeez thats the stupidest comment in the history... or atleast this year so far.<br />
<br />
caring =/= inactivity.<br />
good raid guild =/= elitists without common knowledge of other classes.<br />
<br />
<br />
Looks like i only needed to facepalm the stupidest comment here... the rest of the non-elitists saw the authentic raider and rallied behind him.<br />
<br />
As any decent raider would know, farm-runs are only to get gear and get to the progress-boss... logs dont matter, logs are used to figure out whats wrong if the boss is not going down... gives people some data to exploit between raid nights, especially officers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They're probably using that little island to test redesigning the base of Dalaran (the rock part). Like, mix these textures, positining objects, rocks like this, paint on textures like this, etc. They do it whenever they work on new zones and subzones and reference these test areas off the maps as templates. Since this is alpha, I wouldn't be skeptical of doing just that.</div></div><hr />

What you're describing is an EGO issue -- not a gameplay or performance issue. If things are dropping so fast a dot class can't get anything off, you would think everyone in the raid understands whats up and nobody is thinking anyone is &quot;pathetic&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Cata, MoP and WoD were too easy, to play, to level, to do instances and dont forget about the so-called &quot;heroics&quot;.. they were a laugh, i havent died once in wod with leveling, it was too easy, make it challenging again, make it fun again. <br />
From a personal standpoint, if legion isnt challenging enough for me, i am out. For the time being, i already unsubbed and am just playing other mmo's and games. <br />
(btw, why do we still care about what ghostcrawler says? we all know he went to Riot Games, so he could give info to Blizzard for Heroes of the Storm. )<br />
<br />
I so Agree on all your points &quot;Challenging&quot; is a key factor for a good MMO, like in Vanilla the World has to feel Dangerous and scary, make people think twice about Pulling 2 mobs.<br />
<br />
If you ask me I would like to make Legion as hard as Vanilla wow, make the NPC hit hard and have special abilites.<br />
<br />
PS: Making the World Dangerous will maybe make players group up more, since they would feel safer with people around.<br />
<br />
Blizzard I love you and I wish the best for you and your games.<br />

--- Legion - Dalaran Island ---<br />
<br />
&quot;Dalaran got a new small island floating near it recently.&quot; I really enjoy this, make us more Small island, this would give us the feel that Dalaran where a greater and bigger city.<br />
<br />
PS: how about you add some island with Strucktures &quot;Guarding towers&quot; where you can place Dalaran Troops on that defend the City (As towers you can use the same Model as Warcraft III Magic Tower) and how about you can Make an Island with an PVP arena where people can duel (Nothing to big just something simple that makes the city feel bigger), this would pool people away from the City Sewers (this will make is Easyer on the lag)<br />
<br />
Thanks in Adance Blizzard,<br />
