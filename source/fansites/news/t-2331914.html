There is a chance you'll have to do it if you're a min-maxer though, for the increased reputation that may allow you to reach exalted before.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Which is actually exciting and why I am going to wait patiently until we also know what rewards we will get for having it turned on besides rep and exp. I was about to abandon my PvP servers because I was tired of being ganked while leveling.</div></div><hr />

Calm down man, They are making a toggle for pvp that will give you some perk if you have it ON(more exp/more rep) or whatever they choose to have as a carrot. Also the expansion will NOT be entirely PVP-oriented Because from what i could see all the Island Expeditions, Warfronts and the likes will all be PVE and possibly later on also atleast the Islands able to support 3v3 PVP scenarios. Ofc if you really dont think this is sounds good perhaps you could do like most people will do, just play the game that is live now and wait for more info?</div></div><hr />

Whoa Nelly :D<br />
GG Blizz, your WoD 2.0 has just overtaken Cata in how unlikely you are to get my money for it.<br />

<br />
Calm down man, He's calm. In case you missed something, he's mostly doing some math an expressing his attitude to game making company which decided that putting a whole string of no-sells into xpac reveal could be a huge money saver for some people. Which it clearly is.<br />

Yes yes, when the main premise of xpac's launch is &quot;an all-out war between Horde and Alliance&quot; it's not a PvP xpac at all. Yeah... :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
Developers did great, the questions they got were terrible. Already answered elsewhere or really stupid and pointless.<br />
<br />
<br />
You forgot to add in the Q&amp;A section that The Exodar and Silvermoon are going to be the last bastions for the respective factions.<br />
<br />
What it really means is: &quot;Well they are part of Outland map separated from Eastern kingdoms and Kalimdor. We have no plans or enough resources to change that so far.&quot;<br />
It is fair enough so do not get your hopes too high for them.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sluddyazin</div><div class="date">2017-11-06, 09:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think for most of us who left the game somewhere around WoTLK or later, the birth of the Classic Server will bring a lot of us back. I will be coming back for sure once it's launched. I have no interest at all in BoA, but Vanilla, hell yes. Vanilla had a shit ton of problems, but if I had to choose between it and World Quests, Class Halls, Garrisons, Legendaries and Epics for merely logging in, LFR, Companions, Artifact Weapons ,and all the other garbage in the game now... I know what I choose. <br />
<br />
I'm not saying running UBRS 450 times for a single trinket is fun... but I'll take it over what WoW is today.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Being ganked while leveling was the life of PvP?<br />
<br />
Really?<br />
<br />
That's why ppl grows an avversion to pvp, i think this can only help the way pvp is percieved, and perhaps will bring more players in it.<br />
Those who enjoyed chainkilling lower players are just sociopathics, not pvp players.</div></div><hr />
