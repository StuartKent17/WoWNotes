Blizzard Sending Gift to Veteran Accounts<br />
It looks like Blizzard is planning to send some kind of gift players that have had an account for ten years. A few players have received a notification that a package from Blizzard will be arriving tomorrow. There was a support article about the gift that was taken down shortly after it was posted. <br />
<br />
We don't know if the requirements from the support article are the only requirements. So far, all of the people that have received a notification have been subscribed almost all of the full ten years.<br />
<br />
If you think you are eligible and haven't received a notification, don't worry! This hasn't been officially announced or confirmed yet. The only shipment notifications that have gone out are from UPS. Blizzard has not sent any emails yet. <br />
<br />
If you happen to receive the gift, be sure to post some pictures of it in the comments!<br />
<br />

&lt;div class=&quot;gallery&quot; id=&quot;gallery-mysterypackage&quot;&gt;http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2015/january/thumb/package02.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2015/january/package02.jpg) http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2015/january/thumb/package01.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2015/january/package01.jpg) &lt;/div&gt;<br />
<br />
Tenth Anniversary Physical Gift<br />
As a way of thanking our loyal World of Warcraft players, we will send a physical gift to players who have been playing with us since the beginning. Players who are eligible have received an email at the address listed on their Battle.net accounts. If you did not receive that email, your account is not eligible for this gift.<br />
<br />
These gifts were sent to physical addresses of eligible registered Battle.net accounts. To be eligible for this gift, a player must have created a World of Warcraft account within 60 days of the game's release in America or Europe.<br />
<br />
Eligible players in America have received tracking information for the shipment of the gift. Eligible players in Europe will receive tracking information when your gifts are sent throughout the month. If the shipping address in the email is incorrect, you will need to contact us with the updated address.<br />

<br />
Garrisons<br />

That's the entire point, though... to keep it to a minimum. Lots of press for a small gesture that only a very few number of people will receive.</div></div><hr />

Thats probably exactly why they're doing it. The fewer the people, the less it will cost them.</div></div><hr />

Well, there has been huge gaps on my subscription though since then. I haven't been subbed for the entire 10+ years.<br />

Took several months off to play other MMOs or games like SWTOR, GW:2 WS, etc.<br />

Maybe that's why?</div></div><hr />

That was just edited into the post by chaud a few moments ago. The C&amp;P'd statement from Blizz says emails have gone out, and if you haven't gotten an email you're not eligible.</div></div><hr />

It's sad that people are sad, because they started to play the game at the wrong time? It's not like I don't want people to have that reward. So what's sad about that?</div></div><hr />

That's what I'm thinking.<br />

I mean, heck - should a person who started in vanilla, but quit early-BC, but came back 8+ years later for Draenor be eligible? :P</div></div><hr />

Oh, no email so far, I just have UPS configured to alert me to shipments aimed at my address (this is something you can set up for free on the UPS site and it's very cool and useful, they have other paid services too but the basic account stuff is free).</div></div><hr />

I don't know if that's completely true. I unsubbed for a month or two in mid 2004 or 2005 for a month or two (and here again recently but it hasn't run out yet) and I still got a UPS My Choice notification.</div></div><hr />

If not that's just a stupid idea - Especially to those who've been playing since Vanilla but didn't quite hit the mark.<br />

This seriously needs to be sent out to players as they reach the 10 year mark, and not just a one time gift to people who have 10 years currently, because if that's the case then that's really messed up.<br />

They have to draw the line somewhere. There would always be people who started a few months after their given time frame.<br />

I looked at this in Quicken a few days ago. 10 accounts, 2 of them active the entire 10 years, the remaining active at least 6-8 of the time, plus server transfers, Blizzcons, etc. HOLY COW have I spent a lot of money to Blizzard!!</div></div><hr />

Blizzard used a hamfisted metric to figure out who is deemed a &quot;veteran&quot;. They really should have used something that gauges whether someone is a veteran better - eg, /played time over the Battle.net account? OR, If you've paid for 100 months of subs since release (this works out just over 8 years of subs) - this would actually prove someone deserves the gift, and technically has paid Blizzard enough to make them worthy to receive it.<br />

Really can't agree with Blizzard here.</div></div><hr />

Even when blizzard gift gifts for those who have been there from the start people complain about it? There are a lot of self entitled, arrogant people around it seems. If your sub didn't run from the start or you changed account or whatever how do you expect Blizzard to sort that? It isn't feasible. <br />
<br />
Grats to those getting a nice gift, I hope it is something special :D<br />

For those without a card, they'll likely get their gift by verifying a current delivery address. <br />
People playing for 10 yrs, should however (most of them) long realized that paying for wow month after month adding time codes, is a very inconvenient, and more expensive way. <br />
Why should I play the game, when I know I'm gonna play it anyway, and pay 14.99 when I can get it for 12.99 too..</div></div><hr />

I disagree, if I've been playing the same amount as other people why shouldn't I get a gift for loyalty? This game has taken a massive turn for the worse since Activi$ion got involved, but I still play it. Mainly cause I've sinked in 300-400 days of my life in it, but still.</div></div><hr />

Not complaining at all, just letting others know my situation so they don't feel like they weren't included. I'm very appreciative they are even doing this. <br />
<br />
Interesting part is the package is 7lb. That's pretty heavy.</div></div><hr />
