Blizzard is going to make a couple of changes to threat, among other things:<br />
<br />
<br />
Hotfix: The threat generated by classes in their tanking mode has been increased from three times damage done to five times damage done.<br />
In an upcoming patch: Vengeance no longer ramps up slowly at the beginning of a fight. Instead, the first melee attack taken generates Vengeance equal to one third of the damage dealt by that attack. As Vengeance updates during the fight, it is always set to at least a third of the damage taken in the last two seconds. It still climbs from that point at the previous rate, still decays at the previous rate, and still cannot exceed the current maximum.<br />
<br />
<br />
Read the entire blog post for more details and upcoming changes.<br />
Threat revisited<br />
<br />
One of the fun things about working on an MMO is that the game design will evolve over time, and you have the opportunity to make changes to reflect those design shifts. (And yes, we know that it can sometimes evolve too quickly).<br />
<br />
Back in December, I wrote a blog post about our vision for how threat should work. Since then, the game and the community have continued to progress and the designers have found ourselves changing our minds about the role of threat. Enough that we’re planning to apply a hotfix this week to change how threat works.<br />
<br />
Why have threat?<br />
<br />
Threat’s role, just so we’re all on the same page, is to make fights more interesting. Tanks spend a lot of effort staying alive, but they aren’t under immediate threat of death one-hundred percent of the time. Plus, their staying alive is also dependent on their healers and other external cooldowns. We have always been concerned that if threat was not a big part of tanking gameplay that tanks might get bored just waiting around until it was time to use a cooldown. Likewise, if DPS and healers had no risk of being attacked themselves then the sense of danger facing a powerful creature could erode. Furthermore, every character’s toolbox includes some cool survival and utility abilities and the game feels more shallow if those are exclusively used for PvP. It’s fun for a mage to Frost Nova an attacker and Blink away. It’s fun for a hunter to Feign Death. Yes your life would be a lot easier without threat mechanics, but our goal isn’t to make fights as easy as possible. Our job is to make fights fun. Having too much to manage might not be fun, but it’s also not fun to be bored.<br />
<br />
That’s been our traditional argument for threat needing to matter. Here is the case against it:<br />
<br />
Why not have threat?<br />
<br />
Throttling<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
As I said in the previous blog post, it’s not fun to feel throttled. It’s not fun for the Feral druid to stop using special attacks in order to avoid pulling aggro. It’s fun to use Feint at the right time to avoid dying, but it’s not fun for Feint to be part of your rotational cooldown. We want you to spend most of your effort trying to overcome the dragon or elemental, not struggling against your own tank.<br />
<br />
<br />
Tanks are busy<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I’d also argue that our encounters aren’t really boring these days. We ask tanks to do a lot -- everything from picking up adds, to moving bosses around, to staying out of fires, to providing interrupts, in addition to the classic tank roles of staying alive and generating threat.<br />
<br />
<br />
Threat stats aren’t fun<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
We put threat stats (hit and expertise for the most part) on tanking gear, because without those, tanks would be limited to choosing from among mastery, dodge, and parry. (In the current state of itemization, you are rarely choosing more Strength, Agility, Stamina, or armor.) Druids can’t parry, and even for the plate users, there is a tight relationship between dodge and parry, and even mastery for the warrior and paladin. That gets us dangerously close to the old model of stacking a single uber stat (like Stamina or defense), which makes gearing choices too simplistic for tanks. Did something drop? Okay, put it on. (Contrast this to a DPS caster who might want more or less hit or might favor haste over crit, etc.) <br />
<br />
We want threat stats to be interesting, but the reality is that they aren’t. Any decent tank will usually choose survivability stats over threat stats. Back in the day when taunts and interrupts could miss, you could argue hit was marginally useful. But in a world where hit is really just for generating threat, it isn’t very exciting and tanks get understandably emo when we put too much on their gear. (DKs are somewhat of an exception in a good way -- more on that in a sec.) We do see some players try and get excited about threat stats or even proud of their ability to generate threat, but overall we feel like threat stats are a trap, and it’s usually the case that improving your survivability will have a better net impact on your group’s progression.<br />
<br />
<br />
We don’t need a more complex UI<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
We have threatened for years (see what I did there?) to build in some kind of threat tracking tool into WoW. But is that really good for the game? Do we really need yet another UI element for players to look at instead of looking at the actual game world? We know many raiders in particular use third-party threat mods today, but that has really been borne out of necessity rather than a sense that watching threat is super compelling gameplay. (When we say “super compelling gameplay” you can mentally replace that with “fun.”)<br />
<br />
<br />
Dungeon Finder<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I know this bullet will be a point made by players critical of this change, but I would feel remiss in not bringing it up. We want it to be a positive experience when Dungeon Finder matches experienced players with newer players. The skill and gear of the former can help make up for that of the latter. Who better to teach you boss mechanics than players who have done the fights before? Even better, the gear of a veteran tank can make up for the less powerful gear of a beginning healer (which doesn’t necessarily mean a noob -- it could be the alt of a very experienced raider).<br />
<br />
However, this system fails and often spectacularly so when it’s the tank who is the undergeared player. Even if a competent healer can keep the undergeared tank alive, the fully raid-geared DPS spec is going to constantly be on the verge of pulling threat. That’s not an issue of skill. It’s just numbers. It’s also not a problem that is easy to overcome for either the overgeared DPS or the undergeared tank -- it’s just not a lot of fun for anyone.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
So now what?<br />
<br />
Given all of that, and watching how tanking has unfolded in Cataclysm, we’ve gotten over the concept that threat needs to be a major part of PvE gameplay. We have therefore decided to buff tank threat generation in a hotfix this week to where it’s generally not a major consideration. We expect the community to gradually stop using threat-tracking mods as players realize they don’t need them.<br />
<br />
It’s an important distinction that the concept of “aggro” will still exist. If a DPS spec attacks an add the second it shows up, then the creature is going to come at her. However, if a tank gets an attack or two on a target, then the target should stick to the tank. Worrying about who has the creature’s attention should generally only be a concern at the start of a fight or when additional creatures join the battle. Worrying about a warrior or DK (the classes with nearly non-existent threat dumps) creeping up on tank threat after several minutes will almost certainly not be an issue any longer. (And if it is, we’ll have to make further adjustments.)<br />
<br />
We like abilities like Misdirect. It’s fun as a hunter to help the tank control targets. We are less enamored of Cower, which is just an ability used often to suppress threat. We like that the mage might have to use Ice Block, Frost Nova, or even Mirror Image to avoid danger. We don’t like the mage having to worry about constantly creeping up on the tank’s threat levels. The notion of aggro (who the target is attacking) is a keeper. The notion of threat races (who is about to pull aggro) is going to be downplayed from here on out.<br />
<br />
Upcoming changes<br />
<br />
Here are the specific changes you’re likely to see:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Hotfix: The threat generated by classes in their tanking mode has been increased from three times damage done to five times damage done.<br />
In an upcoming patch: Vengeance no longer ramps up slowly at the beginning of a fight. Instead, the first melee attack taken generates Vengeance equal to one third of the damage dealt by that attack. As Vengeance updates during the fight, it is always set to at least a third of the damage taken in the last two seconds. It still climbs from that point at the previous rate, still decays at the previous rate, and still cannot exceed the current maximum.<br />
<br />
<br />
Long-term changes<br />
<br />
You could argue that once threat is very easy to manage that a warrior tank could just go AFK. In reality, given today’s boss encounters, an AFK warrior would end up standing in the wrong place, missing a tank transition, or otherwise do something or fail to do something that wipes the party or raid.<br />
<br />
That said, we ultimately don’t want tanking to be just standing there soaking boss hits and we would like to have more stats on gear that tanks care about. To solve those challenges, we want to shift more tank mitigation to require active management. We’ll still give all the tanks emergency cooldowns like Shield Wall and Survival Instincts. However, we want to move the shorter cooldowns like Shield Block, Holy Shield and Savage Defense so that they work more like Death Strike. Blood DKs have a lot of control over the survivability they get from Death Strike, but as part of that gameplay, they have to actually hit their target. The other three tanks will get similar active defense mechanics. This doesn’t mean everyone needs to use the DK model of self-healing, but they can use the DK model of managing resources to maximize survivability.<br />
<br />
Death Strike consumes resources to help the tank survive. We toyed at one point with the paladin Holy Shield being a Holy Power consumer and we think we could do so again. Heck we could make Word of Glory the thing you’re supposed to do with Holy Power, so long as we balanced all tanks around that idea and didn’t feel it infringed too much on the DK mechanic. We could make Shield Block cost rage, and change Protection warrior rage income such that they had to manage rage, the way Fury and Arms warriors now must do. If tanks generated more rage from doing damage and less from taking damage, then hitting a target becomes very important, but for mitigation, not threat management reasons. This is a bigger change than it seems though. We don’t want a model where the Prot warrior ignores Shield Slam, Devastate and Revenge (since threat isn’t a big deal) in order to bank all rage for Shield Block (because survival is). Imagine a rage model where you always had enough rage for your core rotational abilities (they could be cheap or even generate rage), so that you could funnel most of your rage into Shield Block when survival mattered and Heroic Strike when it did not. Redesigning Savage Defense to make it a rage sink is an even bigger change, but we think there is an opportunity there to make the rotation more interesting for druids (and all tanks really). Their rotation would help them achieve the goal that usually matters the most to tanks: living.<br />
<br />
This is the kind of design for which we’re really going to need a lot of feedback once it hits. We can implement and verify empirically how much threat a tank generates, but it’s hard for us to replicate the experience of all of the various raiding groups and dungeon parties out there. We invite you to try out the immediate and eventually the long-term changes when they are available and let us know how they feel. Do you miss the threat game? Are you bored when tanking now? Conversely, with the changes, is tanking more fun for you? Does this new implementation of Vengeance feel better? Some systems design calls we can make just by processing numbers, and some are more squishy and involve a lot gut checks and wishy-washy “but how does it FEEL?” language. Messing with this kind of thing is definitely somewhere in the middle.<br />

<br />
You're acting like it was hard to begin with. While threat has never really been an issue before, I'm afraid now it will just be faceroll. Maybe Blizzard doesn't get why people like tanking to begin with. It's more of a challenge than dps. Making it even easier is not the right way to recruit more tanks.</div></div><hr />

Generally speaking it is unnecessary but there are plenty of times with a tank swapping targets, picking up adds, blowing hero/lust out of the gate, or a tank avoiding fire that threat is an issue. As an enhancement shaman myself with only windshear for threat reduction, those times can be annoyingly painful.</div></div><hr />

This, They need to focus on the actual problems vs fiddling with crap that works fine. Stop dumbing down wow. I mean come on, do they think its a &quot;coincidence&quot; they lost 900k subs? =/</div></div><hr />

im also interested in how they have said every class hase some sort of threat dump ... I dont seem to recal one for wars DKs and druids (i dont count the feral one it rarely helps unless its a player pet in PvP) I just hope that this does not impact PvP as then it would just take the cake for Devs going overborde.</div></div><hr />

I think tanking is fine, and the only real point is the one about newbie tanks getting matched with dps in raid gear. Honestly, I think this is EXACTLY what is wrong with WOW... they just randomly change things that really aren´t a major issue. Why in the world did they not spend more time trying to make archeology or a ton of other things more exciting. <br />
<br />
So they are going to spend how much time implementing this.. then another amount of time making survivability more áctive´.. and in the end, it really won´t make things better, just different... but it did waste a lot of dev time that they could have used making other parts of the game better. I think GC, and the rest of the devs need to step back and look at the forest for awhile. This is a game, it is supposed to be fun... but the game is boring, and just randomly making us relearn how to tank or heal every 6 months doesn´t make it fresh, or better. They need to add new things, but actually take the time to make them fun and interesting. it just blows my mind, that with all the boring and repetitive things that are the center of WOW, they are spending time redoing threat.. again....</div></div><hr />

As a tank, I am saddened. In a fight like Domo (normal) for example, the threat race at the start is pretty much the only compelling thing about the fight for the tank. I LIKE having to clench my ass cheeks while I desperately try and stay ahead of my mage and dk. It's sad to see the LFD tool change the way thegame is designed. A core mechanic like threat should not be designed around playing with strangers in the LFD...it should be designed around playing with good players. That said...meh...who cares. A few weeks after the change is implemented 'good' players will hardly feel the impact and 'less-good' players will finally be able to tank in the LFD. I'm not happy with this change (as someone who tanks and does melee dps) but really it shouldn't greatly affect gameplay for already competent tanks.</div></div><hr />

It does seem like they are more and more retreating back to the faceroll, spam aoe days of WOTLK. I wonder, do they really think they lost all those subs because the game was a little harder in Cata?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phaidrae</div><div class="date">2011-08-16, 06:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It shouldn't really affect PVP because I dont think they're buffing the actual damage done by each attack - but instead increasing threat generated by each attack, scaling with how much damage you do. I do however have to continue guffawing @ Blizz for thinking it creates &quot;a positive experience&quot; when grouping up a hapless noob (or multiple hapless noobs) with well-seasoned players...Personally I find it infinitely annoying when I [actually] decide to use the RDF system to get into a group - and I'm put with a tank in half pvp gear, sloppily reforged in some laughable way and two DPS who JUST met the gear requirements to queue for the heroic. That leaves me (the healer), and the other DPS (who for arguments' sake is as geared as I am) with few options: 1: struggle thru a lot of messy pulls and hope for a wipe so we can leave w/o gettin the debuff 2: play &quot;how to play WoW 101&quot; for the millionth time with a stranger and see just how useless that is 3: hope like hell that you get lucky and make it thru painlessly and make sure that you have ample gold for repairs and a lot of spare time to get thru a dungeon that should take like 45 min tops IMO the little &quot;check here if you have dungeon experience&quot; flag should be revised into something that could possibly sort you into a group of people with comparable gear/experience/skill (tho this is way too hard to judge) in said dungeons. Let the lesser-experienced/geared people go thru it in groups of the same. Chances are they might actually learn something instead of just being told what to do in a nerdraging huff from someone (like me) who lacks patience for those that think that WoW is hard to play. (i.e - ilvl 350+ dps who can barely pull 6-7k DPS standing still)</div></div><hr />

As a tank, I am saddened. In a fight like Domo (normal) for example, the threat race at the start is pretty much the only compelling thing about the fight for the tank. I LIKE having to clench my ass cheeks while I desperately try and stay ahead of my mage and dk.<br />
<br />
Personally, I would rather not have that. If your DPS is stupid enough to not throttle, let you get threat first, then they don't deserve much credit. I don't find it interesting on my tanks or DPS characters to have to hope I can hold on.</div></div><hr />

We’ll still give all the tanks emergency cooldowns like Shield Wall and Survival Instincts. However, we want to move the shorter cooldowns like Shield Block, Holy Shield and Savage Defense so that they work more like Death Strike. So instead trying to fix DK they take the most broken tanking mechanic and try to apply it to other tanks? o_O' Not sure what they want to do but I don't like how it sounds..</div></div><hr />

I just had this discussion with someone the other day, that the reason queue times are so high is because tanking right now is so hard. If you join a random dungeon in 359 gear and have a dps sitting there in 370+ gear ripping threat off you and calling you bad for not holding threat. Aside from the abuse you have to worry about pulling the mobs gathering them up and you have 3 dps single targeting 3 different targets that your expected to hold threat on but there are also mechanics you have to deal with. As a warrior you charge only to have the arcane mage pop all cooldowns except mirror images (because it still has a minute left on the cooldown from two pulls ago) and now you play the taunt game as the mage rolls 60k dps and your only capable of maybe 40k tps but now your nerfed even more on threat generation as the mob runs away from you and is out of range of anything but your taunt. I can't tell you how many dungeons I join as a tank already at the last boss because the previous tank just gave up on the group.</div></div><hr />

They fail to understand that the casual/bad players are the ones with the nothing to lose. They play halfheartedly, complain/quit when it's too hard and come back when the game gets dumbed down.

<br />
In heroic 10/25 man It's a nightmare for the tank and the DPS.... As a Feral Druid with only 1 ability (Cower - Reduces threat by 10% USES GBC AND COSTS 25 ENERGY!) I have to sit idle for 10 seconds before any pull since our tank can't reforge to hit/exp, he really needs the extra stats for all the bosses. <br />
<br />
I lose DPS because I can't pop all my cooldowns right at the start and time it with a prepot, I have to use Cower which further gimps me, so for me, this is a godsend and I'm extremely happy Blizzard has done this!</div></div><hr />

So you're a bad DK? My guild's DK is far and away the *best* tank I've played with. All the healers agree it is far far easier to keep him alive than our warrior tank or our pally tank.

Actually, tanking has been hard for me once; DK at level 60+. Oh boy, that was a royal pain.<br />

Other than that... nope, not really hard. Threat never relied on &quot;skill&quot;, it relied on stupid people getting triggerhappy and stupid gear problems/ability functions.<br />

It's true finding good DKs is a tough job, but to be honest, it kinda sounds like your Warrior and Paladin tanks are bad, not that your DK is exceptional.<br />

Communication between members of the team is at an all time low since the rise of &quot;random anonymous dungeon finder groups&quot;. <br />

The problem is that DPS is super easy, and with lack of skilled players continuing to play, the mouth breather dps decide to tank, to compensate they have to make tanking mouth breather easy to keep people from leaving.</div></div><hr />

I think you misunderstood my post. I never said casuals = bad, just that some people consider casuals as bad, hence casual/bad. Threat really hasn't mattered too much, it certainly matter more back in vanilla or BC than it did in WLK or Cataclysm. The thought process of threat decay was murmured by devs back prior to Cataclysm release and then was scrapped altogether.</div></div><hr />

I personally like the changes. When I have threat, I'm having fun. When a Fury Warrior (my main is fury, off is prot, both specs are 370+) is popping all his CD's on the pull, getting salved, I'm getting MD'd, and he's still about to pull threat... I'm NOT having fun. The biggest issue is the lack of hit and expertise, and until they fix that whole issue with nearly all tanks, threat was going to be (and is still going to be) inconsistent.

It made people pay attention to what they were doing. It's just another example in the long line of Blizzard dumbing down WoW to the lowest common denominator. After the first 30 seconds of a fight there's nobody within half of my threat and my guild's DPS all hover between 25-28K. It's just a completely unnecessary change that makes the game more boring for people who weren't bad in exchange for making it easier for people who get a headache trying to think about more than one thing at a time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Getting 3x-5x increase in threat does two things.<br />
1. Make threat not matter<br />
2. Allow you to be lazy with your abilities.<br />

This change is essentially the change to Icy Touch in WLK for all classes.</div></div><hr />

I have to really agree with this comment.<br />
<br />
I'm hopeful that the new mechanics that will make hit/expertise relevant again (the &quot;DK style of tank design&quot;) will make tanking interesting. But for the time being, they just made hit/expertise even LESS relevant, with no clear timeline for solution, and just made tanking a lot less fun and interesting. <br />
<br />
So now the only difference between a tank who executes a good rotation and a tank who executes a bad rotation is... tank dps? :/</div></div><hr />

I know it takes away a important part of our job but okay. While this will change how a tank works in the future for now it seems we will just have a easier time dealing with threat than we have had ever before.<br />
<br />
For the people who will say this will make it easier it will only change one thing the mind of the tank is no longer busy with threat but instead focussus on the aspects of a boss fight ... oh wait we already did this common guys even half a decent tank should in raid have no trouble at all keeping threat so this wont change a damm thing. Think before you actually reply.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because most players are not very good, and it does make the game dramatically easier for them.<br />
<br />
Not that I'm actually opposed to making the game easier, per se, but there is no reason for a bad tank to learn a proper rotation. It doesn't matter for survival (at least right now), and it doesn't matter for threat either anymore.<br />
<br />
Tanks who only use 1 button FTW now. /sigh</div></div><hr />

So, the change affects you, since you are good, obviously, and helps some bad players for the first ten seconds of a fight. Are you seriously arrogant enough to say that this makes the game &quot;ezmode&quot; and is catering to bad players? It doesn't affect you. At all.

If I didn't misread the post, you're missing a point. Threat is being &quot;removed&quot;, but it's being replaced by active management of survival skills. The post explicitly states that just taking threat out of the equation would make it boring.<br />
I think it's a good change. Tanks still get to find something to use and separate good tank from the bad while dps doesn't have to worry about the now-trivial threat management. I mean, waiting for 5 seconds or pressing feint now and then doesn't really add much to fights. In contrast, it's a stale mechanic.<br />
Win-win.<br />
<br />
This way blizz can go more crazy on fights too because dps will be busy with dps, tanks with survivability, healers with keeping stuff alive. They're all connected but still doing their own thing.</div></div><hr />

Then most tanks are terrible and have no idea how to play or enjoy their role being dumbed down so much that anyone with a keyboard can play as well as them where threat is concerned.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is what makes me feel uncomfortable with this change. It's only going to mean people in random dungeons paying even less attention than they do already (which isn't much).<br />
<br />
I don't want tanking to be made easier just because people are so obsessed by their recount read-out that they have to charge in whirlwinding/arcane-blasting as soon as my Avenger's Shield has left my hand and not even reached it's target.<br />
<br />
I would rather have the opposite happen, so that players benefit from showing a little appreciation/understanding of the mechanics of the game, and learn to function as a team to get the job done. Sometimes I want to pull the mobs to me. Sometimes I might even want to LoS them around a corner. Crazy I know! ...<br />
<br />
... My worry is that this is just going to increase the number of runs where the dps charge around like toddlers tanked up with Sunny-D pulling everything they like because it's now easy for the tank to get aggro. I don't really want to play that sort of game, but sadly because 5-mans are now solely for mindlessly zerging through as quickly as possible just to get your Valor Points, I can see why this change might be considered &quot;a good thing&quot; for some...</div></div><hr />

<br />
I really hope we don't move the DK tanking model though. Maybe make it a more viable option to WoG tank or to actually give us a chance to swap between the 2, WoG and SotR</div></div><hr />

I quit a few months ago. I just find the hilarity in giving WLK Icy Touch threat to all classes suddenly makes the game better. It fails to punish players performing badly which in turn hurts a greater portion of the game population. You encourage bad players to fulfill roles they can't handle and then you dumb down portions of the game to compensate. You had DK's back in WLK needing snap threat, they made the change to Icy Touch. Dk's then used just Icy Touch to hold threat and did little else. <br />
<br />
People fall into the routine that threat is easy and is irrelevant, then months down the road they rethink the tanking model. Threat matters a little bit more and you get the frustration that you have now from the bads.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Etou</div><div class="date">2011-08-16, 07:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wait, people were having threat issues? Wat. I mean, the only threat issues I know of are bear tanks with AoE, and warriors with snap AoE to a lesser extent.<br />
<br />
Bear AoE threat at 85 has always been fine. AoE Mitigation used to be a problem, but that's largely fixed. This change will make Warriors who are just starting out (ilvl 330 - 350) a lot easier. I have a warrior alt that I don't get the opportunity to gear as well as it could be, and when I run into a ilvl 372+ dps, keeping aggro is almost impossible. I have to sacrifice a lot of my damage mitigation to hold aggro. Lately, I've had to reforge to hit/exp and away from mitigation stats to hold aggro against these guys. I assume a lot of them are farming Chaos orbs.<br />
<br />
On my bear this was never a problem, so I won't see an issue with this at all. I think this is an excellent change especially considering the tank shortage. Gearing a new tank with people running around in FL gear is painful right now, with the elitist tards such as those on full display here doing nothing but making the process that much harder.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I personally like the changes. When I have threat, I'm having fun. When a Fury Warrior (my main is fury, off is prot, both specs are 370+) is popping all his CD's on the pull, getting salved, I'm getting MD'd, and he's still about to pull threat... I'm NOT having fun. The biggest issue is the lack of hit and expertise, and until they fix that whole issue with nearly all tanks, threat was going to be (and is still going to be) inconsistent. So, I welcome any threat changes they make.<br />
<br />
AND... If threat was the last bastion of hope you had in Blizzard and WoW, and you would SERIOUSLY quit over this, I would hate to be your employer.<br />
Its your own fault if you pop all CDs at the beginning of the fight knowing you will be close to pull or getting one-shot by the boss. And its your own fault aswell for using mastery sockets instead of something like hit. How much does a tank get from 20 mastery? How much from 20 or even 40 hit? Its not blizzards fault if you listen to the mainflow that tells you to go for full mastery and whine afterwards &quot;I cant hit the boss, I wear full +370 and loose threat to a green arcane mage&quot;. Its possible to have at least 1-2% hit without looseing the same amount of mastery.</div></div><hr />

Read the whole post: they do it because they want to shift your job as a tank towards active mitigation instead of the current model, where threat and mitigation both play a small role.

<br />
But that's the thing. Threat doesn't matter right now. Sure, on my hunter if I don't Misdirect and/or Feign while bursting at the start of a fight fully buffed, the tank can say goodbye to threat normally. Thing is, if you play with players doing that, then you have a bigger problem than threat. If your raiders are already doing everything right, then threat hasn't been an issue for a some time. This really only affects those players who really just suck and mash their buttons to make numbers appear. It's not going to make a huge difference to players who already know what to do. And the best part is, in the few situations where the tank needs to grab threat asap and while also on the move, I don't need to hold back quite as much if Misdirect/Feign Death are on cooldown. My point is, this change is pretty circumstantial for good players and really only affects some players a lot. And all it does is make pug tanks not want to rip their eyes out!<br />
<br />
And if threat becomes an issue again down the road, then we'll adapt for that. It would've happened either way, so it's really not an argument against doing this I think.</div></div><hr />

Exactly. If you look at how tanks gem/reforge/enchant anyway, this is what tanks really worry about. They don't want to worry about threat, they want just enough, or for DPS to cool it. Tanks can't get enough damage reduction, and Blizz is just tuning the game to how we actually want to play.<br />
<br />
I actually look forward to playing looking at a Damage mitigated/avoided meter than a threat meter.</div></div><hr />

Stop dumbing down wow. I mean come on, do they think its a &quot;coincidence&quot; they lost 900k subs? =/<br />
<br />
Actually, WoW isn't dumb enough. That's what lost them the subs. Compare Wrath to Cata. In Cata, they ramped up the difficulty in dungeons (regular and more so in heroic), starter raids, and also altered how healers heal (making them think more). This all made the game more difficult compared to Wrath. People got pissed with it, and left. They tried to affirm their stance with the &quot;Dungeons are Hard!&quot; devblog and people kept leaving. So, they've made concessions.<br />
<br />
The raid nerf, the Heroic damage/healing boost, the tweak to CC, now the tanking thing. I wonder what's next. Maybe another raid nerf when 4.3's raids come out...</div></div><hr />

I think even 2 times would have been enough to breeze through a dungeon with a beginner tank.<br />
<br />
They're raising it FROM 3x (which it already was) TO 5x. Which means they're raising it by 1.666x, not even the 2x you suggest.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Deployed</div><div class="date">2011-08-16, 08:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The problem is that DPS is super easy, and with lack of skilled players continuing to play, the mouth breather dps decide to tank, to compensate they have to make tanking mouth breather easy to keep people from leaving.<br />
<br />
Just to be clear, I'm not actually against the chages, despite what I said. At the end of the day, I'm not a tank, nor do I perform in heric raids where the &quot;issue&quot; that is being addressed (despite the validity of the conspiracy theory), so I can't really say what is and isn't needed.<br />
<br />
However, what I will say is that when it comes to my understanding of heroic raid content, and how DPS perform, even though comparing DPS to Tanking can be summised as &quot;tanking is harder/more complex than DPS&quot;, that doesn't mean it's easy to achieve the level that the heroic raiding DPS players achieve.<br />
<br />
I personally feel that the complexity between roles actually closes a fair bit as you progress through the degrees of content difficulty, but if there is a threshold within heroic raid player development where tanks have no option but to sacrifice mitigation for threat, then Blizzard have been doing things wrong.<br />
<br />
If DPS and healers only have to care about 2-3 secondary stats and tanks have to care about 6+, then Blizzard have been doing things wrong.<br />
<br />
If new/bad/learning players are struggling with becoming better, then Blizzard have been doing things wrong.<br />
<br />
These are things that need to be addressed. However, are the upcoming changes the right ones? Player mentality is actually the biggest broken aspect of the game right now. <br />
<br />
Players don't want their time wasted while other players try to learn how to do things right. This is an example of the players doing things wrong.<br />
<br />
New tanks jumping into heroics without leveling through the normal modes is also an example of players doing things wrong.<br />
<br />
However, the biggest issue I see here? This change will not help mid-ranged raids at all. Surely this is the area where uneducated tanks are struggling the most?<br />
<br />
The one positive I will take with me, active mitigation management, even if it does shine a light at DPS and Tanks charing gear in the next expansion. abilities&gt;gear&gt;stupidity.</div></div><hr />

It just masks the real problem, threat not mattering. Healers have to watch bars and heal those that need it. DPS needs to kill things and have to use rotations and watch dps meters to excel.

<br />
Says the guy who quit and therefore never stepped foot in Firelands. And I myself have had fun with various fights in every tier of content since Classic.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure I understand what all the debate is about. Let's try to look at all angles here.<br />
<br />
First off, the Dev Watercooler started March 23rd, 2011, with this very topic. They have a reached a resolution they agreed upon would be best at this time for their game. This does not mean they spent the past 5 months working SOLELY on this, so please stop using the scapegoat &quot;they should've been fixing broken things&quot;. They probably have dozens of changes/projects they're working on simultaneously, this is simply one that's come to a head.<br />
<br />
Secondly, try to think who this effects and how before you bash it. Their plan is to shift a tanks focus from being concerned with threat as a &quot;fun&quot; factor to being concerned with survival as the &quot;fun&quot; factor. Popping one or two CD's every 3 minutes is NOT an engaging way of surviving. As a tank, the &quot;fun&quot; should be in how well you can mitigate damage, not how well you can dish it out. Up until now, Blizzard believes (and it makes sense) that tanks have been playing the wrong game. And where do you yourself fit in the scope of things?<br />
<br />
-If you're currently pushing Firelands content, chances there aren't many existent threat issues. This means that dishing out threat is already NOT fun because it's currently NOT something that's difficult to maintain. This change takes NOTHING away from you and yet will still give you something interesting to do.<br />
<br />
-If you are experiencing threat issues, whether it be in raids or LFD, this change is certainly for the better. It certainly wouldn't surprise me that would-be tanks are staying out of the LFD due to threat concerns, so I'd agree that LFD groups may form quicker going forward.<br />
<br />
Reading through the other responses, it's quite comical to see the virtually even divide. One person will say &quot;actively managing defensive CD's might make me come back&quot;, then the next post will be &quot;shit like this made me cancel&quot;. But most of those against this change have piss-poor or irrelevant reasons to shoot it down. I'll quote Chris from the Daily Blink:<br />
<br />
Q. How many WoW players does it take to change a light bulb?<br />
A. WHAT?! CHANGE?!<br />

That comment successfully nullified any point you may have had in your rambling post. Giving all tank specs a 3-5x threat boost does nothing for those that can manage their tools effectively and only hand holds the bad players. We all know what happened to DK's when the Icy Touch change went live and this is effectively the same thing for all of them.<br />
<br />
I can see this change be beneficial if they make other tank classes have active mitigation, but there's been nothing but speculation on that front since the beginning of us discussing the problems that DK tanks have.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Maybe, maybe not. To be honest the only time threat is an issue is in 5-mans (yes, even for good tanks), if you have threat issues in raids you probably shouldn't have a raid spot or your DPS need a talking to (first 5 seconds of the fight). The idea of managing tools effectively and giving a benefit to doing so is a bit of a separate conversation than from threat in the current model (save for maybe for DKs). Almost no tank good or bad currently has to worry about managing resources to generate threat or sacrifice resources to do so. Threat generating abilities can largely be ignored unless they serve some purpose in regards to mitigation (Runic Empowerment &amp; Rune Strike for instance or Savage Defense). I don't see it hand holding bad players if it's not really an issue, now if they started giving a base 10% less damage taken for x seconds of inactivity, you might have an argument.</div></div><hr />

They aren't buffing anything &quot;back&quot; to wotlk. hand of salv/threat modifiers are ALREADY BAKED IN when you spec tank. This is buffing anything back, this is further reduction, further ez moding, of what used to be an interesting role, tanking. Now you just pick up a shield and auto attack.<br />

Although, Safeguard is far more viable now that I don't have to worry about screwing a tank with sudden threat drop.Shield Block costing rage sounds like a bad idea though - It really won't make our rotation more interesting since spending rage is just giving up threat, and threat hardly matters now. I hope they think about it hard.I have a few ideas to make warrior tanking more interesting:Shield specialization no longer reduces the cooldown of Shield Block. (they are trying to shy away from 'must-have' talents, and the below change addresses this as well)The cooldown of Shield Block is reduced by 6 seconds whenever Shield Slam deals damage. (the rotation for sword and board is more interesting since it correlates to Shield Block uptime. Hit and Expertise are much less useless, Haste is slightly less useless)Impending Victory talent is removed. Improved Revenge now gives Revenge a chance to proc Impending Victory. (Allowing it over 20% health but trying it to an ability with a cooldown makes it reasonably balanced, especially when you consider trying to work it into your now relevant Sword and Board rotation. Also makes Devastate viable again).New talent - Healing Surge. 2 min cooldown Removes all HoTs on you but provides 50% of the healing instantly (a little more interesting. The loss of HoT in exchange for the instant health is an interesting cost to manage form both a tanking and healing perspective).The above would need to be tested and tuned, but it looks fun to me anyway :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
In heroic 10/25 man It's a nightmare for the tank and the DPS.... As a Feral Druid with only 1 ability (Cower - Reduces threat by 10% USES GBC AND COSTS 25 ENERGY!) I have to sit idle for 10 seconds before any pull since our tank can't reforge to hit/exp, he really needs the extra stats for all the bosses. <br />
<br />
I lose DPS because I can't pop all my cooldowns right at the start and time it with a prepot, I have to use Cower which further gimps me, so for me, this is a godsend and I'm extremely happy Blizzard has done this!<br />
<br />
<br />
This, a thousand times this. My feral pulls threat from ANY tank at the start of the fight. If magically the tank gets misdirects and salvs spammed on me, I can pull like 30k+ at the start, but normally I have to spam cower and waste my CDs sitting there doing nothing and it drops like 18k or some crap...

wth. 6 year veteran tank and you want to go play gw:2 which has no tank... they are not reducing threat they are increasing tank's threat production. it is further easy mode for threat but if you pick up a shield and auto attack you will die because you will have to use your rotation to SURVIVE and mitigate damage</div></div><hr />

<br />
all aspects and arguments on and of the change are well thought out and valid. I agree especially on the part where tank rotations could (And should) be designed around pushing buttons that reduce damage taken, not just a dps rotation as is the case on a warrior and druid (paladin too to a lesser extent). DKs are the only tanks who are constantly busy watching their survival cooldowns and at times with sweat dripping from their forehead trying to ration resource breadcrumbs into surviving a few seconds longer yet at the sime time having dps inches away on their heels and forced into pushing dps as well, taking away the stressfulness of keeping threat will give valuable seconds to think about mitigation, the real thing. <br />
<br />
And that's what tanking should be about, spending the moment thinking about the next boss attack and how best to counter it (pooling holy power for a word of glory or runes for a death strike to have ready and cast the second after Big Punch hits you for 150k for example. Something warriors could really use too btw, were a bit helpless on self healing outside of cooldowns, unlike paladins who can Word of Glory, Lay on hands, hell they can even Radiance to stay up a little longer. Warriors pray for lucky Blood Craze procs, survival from random procs now that is boring and unintuitive. <br />
<br />
While on topic of paladin tanks, the control over ones own -and- the groups survival is also part of the reason prot paladins are so popular no doubt, beside the standard arsenal of -dmg cooldowns and self healing, they can lay on hands the healer, blessing of freedom the frostbolted rogue out of a voidzone (lets say his cloak is on cd), then go right ahead and hand of protection the mage who has a dog eating him, and to celebrate the occasion then pops Divine Guardian reducing his groups damage taken by 20% for 6s. Hell he can even use that 3 holy power Word of Glory on someone else than himself, almost like a DK transfering a death strike heal unto a friendly player. <br />
<br />
A warrior can only silently contemplate and cry as his healer is dying in a fire spamming heals on everyone but himself, the frost bolted rogue not making it in time and dying in the voidzone, the mage being eaten alive by the dog (lets say its a dog of hell that eats ice blocks and is untankable). Rallying cry does not save the day, it only delays the inevitable in those (common) situations, the paladin has infinitely more power over his groups fate. (I didn't even mention Hand of Sacrifice or using Seal of Insight instead of a dps seal, or using the judgement mana to offheal during offtanking, the support options are near limitless and make me cry when tanking on my warrior).<br />
<br />
DKs have similar power in that they can exceedingly well keep themselves alive, do a tiny bit of group healing with blood tap, combat ress anyone who dies, and army can be very powerful against adds. Druids can use a well timed Tranquility and bring the hole groups health back up during transition phases, innervate the healer, or combat ress someone. Warriors can only dream of helping their group in such ways.. <br />
<br />
Here are some suggestions how to give warrior tanks a small ammount of the group support that all other tanks have, without being overpowered: <br />
<br />
-Shouts healing the protection warrior, for example 10% health when using a shout, through a late protection talent. And/or make shout reduce groups damage taken by 10% for 4s. <br />
<br />
-Impeding Victroy change (most warrior tanks currently skip this talent, for a 2 point talent it's expensive, clunky, annoying and forces spamming a mediocre filler attack for mediocre self heals and reducing the prot warriors dps to terrible when used to full effect) - Instead it should have a chance to proc off all the warriors attacks against a target below 20%. <br />
<br />
-A deep protection talent (maybe coupled into Impeding Victory) that makes Enraged Regeneration heal the whole group for 50% of the regeneration effect, scaling with the warriors own self healing talents, similar to a weaker version of tranquility but easier to use, or a paladin's Divine Guardian (2 min cooldown that reduces whole raids damage taken by 20% for 6s) or Radiance. <br />
<br />
-Safeguard - Allows you to use charge/intercept on friendly targets once every 30s (without stunning or damaging them of course), this does not put charge/intercept on cooldown when used offensively, but you can only charge/intercept friendly players once every 30s (like intervene). <br />
<br />
-Intervene - Instead of charging at a friendly player, when used on a friendly taget within 40 yard the next attack against them (single target or aoe) will deal 40% less damage, and prevent that attack from killing the target. The warrior shouts to a friendly player in his group: GET DOWN! Reducing the damage of the next attack against them by 40%, and makes them survive at 5% health if the attack would have otherwise killed them. 2min cd. Warrior can't cast it on himself. Near useless in PvP, since the smallest white offhand swing consumes the effect, but when well timed on a friendly raid tank or player standing in super nova's range, the warrior can save them, if only for a few critical seconds before healer fills them up. <br />
<br />
Thanks for your time if you bothered to read it all, I love tanking on my warrior, but I have stopped tanking with her since I can do much more good for my group's and my own survival tanking on my paladin! <br />

Only started playing in TBC, but since then:<br />
- removal of crushing blows <br />
- removal of defense rating <br />
- only 1 type of tanking weapon speed <br />
- reforging to take almost any gear <br />
- Self healing mechanism, instead of mitigation <br />
<br />
I loved the time I passed on maintankadin researching gear setups, talent setups, rotation setups, to pull out the max dps and thus threat possible of my class. Threat is part of the things you see in a good tank, and there you go, something unique will go down the drain again. To the people that don't think it's fun to hold aggro, you're mistaken on your feeling. It's not fun trying to hold aggro from noobs and people that do wtf they want, but hold aggro from good players is pretty much the only thing fun and challanging about tanking. Removing that, you're just a dps getting hit on. <br />
edit: I forgot DR, the only spec in game that has some. how fun is it to get less and less effects on stats as your gear gets better right?<br />
<br />
IMO, next change? Tanking gear removed, you have talents to to convert crit--&gt; parry, haste --&gt; dodge. <br />
<br />
After not caring about block cap (crushing blows), after not caring about crit immune and defense rating (read, how to organize your gear to have the best aggro possible while still maintaining crit immune.), after not caring about drops (reforging), , after thinking 1 more spell name is too much to remember (shield bash gone and replace) let's not care about threat anymore (vengeance and+ threat), next stop, what's tanking gear? <br />
Seriously, tanking was about adapting your gear to your healers and the encounter, it was something unique about the class, and something you could be respected for. those changes, 1 after another is just making tanking a generic role, and like everything in WoW at the moment, it's removing the uniqueness and aspect of the game, patch after patch.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I said it was &quot;further reduction... ... of what used to be an interesting role.&quot;<br />
<br />
Oh no, I can push holy shield every 30 seconds, and hit shield wall when DBM tells me. 2 interactions required past autoattack. WHEEEEE FUN!<br />
<br />
Furthermore, GW:2 does have tanks, any role can tank, you swap your weapon set to fill different roles. So, talk about an engaging playstyle, my engineer (or whatever cool dps class i decide to roll) can both heal and tank if needed.<br />
<br />
I'm dislexic so give me a break -_-<br />

they said it wouldn't be about using holyshield every 30 sec and using shield wall. you are clearly a war or paladin and didn't try dk current tanking mode or maybe your one of the dks that let the healers do all the job and hope for good dpses<br />
<br />
pretty sure your GW tank thing then is the same as wow... your trading 2 25 cents for 5 10 cents. who said gw will have threat? and if they do, who said that it'll be hard to keep? chances are you'll just be doing what you do as a dps but with a shield and lower numbers.<br />

<br />
Issue is a big word, cause it was still working. <br />
<br />
All I mean is that, that's a little detail that won't make any difference when I log in a capital city, make a quick AH tour, take my flying mount, make a ride around the town, queue up for a dungeon...wait 15 minutes to find out that my pug players can't get pass 10k dps and we finally wipe on the first ZG boss, quit the group and find out I got a 30 minutes debuff...logout and wait for raiding. <br />

I'm a paladin that actually played like a blood dk, back when it was possible. Sacrificing threat for survivability, balancing threat output versus vengeance. I know exactly what the playstyle is like.<br />

I'm pretty sure GW:2 won't be anything like Rift or WoW. Go educate yourself on it sometime. And so what if a tank is just a dps spec with a shield? That's one extra item to carry, not 15, a weapon swap, not a dual spec switch, a choice in playstyle instead of 2h tank, 1h tank 1, 1h tank 2, or furry tank blatantly copied from 1h tank 1.</div></div><hr />

I don't think you tanked on a pala a lot.<br />
Most of the fights where hands are useful, I could never use them because they were too far away (ruby sanctum, rotface etc in wrath), and each time they cost a gcd too, and in this example, you can't magically save everyone at the same time either. <br />
That said, I'm absolutely not a fan of self healing as tank, I don't think a tank should have the possibility of self heal, but rather mitigation. WoG on others are to me stupid mechanics, same as DK healing, but that's just me.</div></div><hr />

You are right, a well designed raid encounter will have means to prevent the full use of such situationally powerful support tools, however most fights give opportunity for the smart paladin to play his support to the fullest. When tanking Rotface in the center of the room, I used to Blessing of Protection any healer who was being targeted by the large slimes as they spawned, their agro could be tricky no matter how ontoes the slime tank was.<br />
<br />
Hand of Sacrifice is fantastic, 30% damage reduction on a friendly tank is -huge- when, effectively another cooldown to their arsenal at your disposal. The current Intervene prevents 1 attack (usually not even that, it can be very unreliable), and unlike hand spells, requires you to charge all the way over the friendly player's melee range and through whatever might lie inbetween, most raid tanks can't afford leaving their positions all too often.<br />
<br />
Lay on Hands? I've saved so many wipes with this in raids and 5 mans. Can top off a near death tank within 1 gcd, at a 7min cd that's simply magnificent.<br />
<br />
Prot paladin self healing is but an icing on the cake and not necessary to use at all, it's simply a bonus in addition to all the support tools available to you. <br />
<br />
The true trump of being a prot paladin is having the tools to assist and counter almost any danger on individual party members without interrupting the tanking process at all. A protection warrior has none of that, we have our dps rotation, there is no reactive self healing outside of Frenzied Regeneration. We have 1 support cooldown, which is Rallying Cry, and that pales in comparison to Divine Guardian. We have 0 support tools to reduce a friendly targets damage taken, or heal the group, we are the only tanking class with such drastic limitations to group support.</div></div><hr />

Threat shouldn't be a concern - I don't want to have to be watching my threat meters all the time as the tank to see who is going crazy and might pull, I want to focus on the boss either keeping debuffs up, moving out of bad stuff, watching for adds, or managing my own survivability.

I'm sorry but balancing the game after LFG is one of the worst things they could do, and this won't change the DPS queues in any significant way.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually there was an issue with starting threat at the beginning of boss fights. Tanks would get an unlucky parry/dodge on primary abilities and a dps would pull aggro. Even if said abilities landed, dps would often ride the tanks on threat for a good while until vengeance kicked in. <br />
<br />
This was (or still is) an issue with warriors at least. Heroic Throw can miss, shouts give no threat, Recklessness on pulls is a double edged sword, can't always charge. In a 10m environment, raid might not have a rogue or a hunter.<br />
<br />
Is this a fix I personally was looking for? No. I would have liked Blizz to make hit and exp more appealing. Yet they remain as trash stats.</div></div><hr />

Threat gen has not been a problem for most of our guild tanks, due to the fact they are not far off the Hit and Exp caps.<br />
<br />
Imo, Blizz should make Hit/Exp more valuable, because a lot of Tanks don't have any. I'm not saying those with no hit/exp are bad tanks, but tanks with no Hit/Exp choose this path because Mastery is a much better stat to have, however no Hit/Exp means you miss alot of attacks which reduces your threat generation. My personal choice is to get close to the Hit/Exp cap.<br />
<br />
Our Arcane mage blows all CD's and timewarp at start of Majordomo Staghelm, yet I still keep threat becasue I choose to have Hit/Exp close to cap.<br />
<br />
Maybe if blizzard looked into making Hit/Exp more a requirement then they wouldn't need to make Threat buffs. Has it stands, I may aswell remove omen add-on once this goes live, there will be no need for it</div></div><hr />

He generally doesn't tank PUGs because he got sick of the community. As DPS the other night he spent 40 seconds doing nothing but white damage so as to not pull threat in a BoT/BWD run (he was bringing his main to an alt run to make up numbers).

Two classes having threat problems doesn't mean you should buff tanks threat across the board by 3-5x. It means those two classes are either dealing too much damage, or need passive threat bonuses.</div></div><hr />

I've been tanking Zuls recently with dps outgearing me quite some, and I had to struggle for threat, but I liked it. It made me proud that I could do whatever the fight asked of me AND push out enough threat to keep aggro, even though it was the first time I went into Zuls. Plus it makes sense you know? I'm the tank, but that guy over there shooting fire and ice at you is much more dangerous in actual fact.. Yet since I'm a big scary bear and also hitting you (like a truck instead of like a train) you're still attacking me. I think this story can get away with this current factor three, but with a factor five? Don't think so. So Blizzard better give us something back for it. Luckily, it looks as though they are going to do that, with survivability becoming more active instead of just passively stacking stats. I'm hoping they'll do this right. And if they do it right, they're gonna give us something back in terms of gearing. Right now it feels pretty boring to me. Hey look I got an upgrade! Gem Agi/Sta, reforge anything that isn't crit or mastery to dodge. That's pretty much stat-stacking to me. What Greg Street is hinting at (you'll need hit/exp/crit/perhaps even haste for generating resources which you'll then use for your surviving abilities) sounds appealing to me. Unfortunately for us tanks, they're first taking something away from us, and in 'a later patch' giving us something back. From the viewpoint of my hunter though, rejoice. Worrying about threat all that much when you're DPSing, while it might sound logical, feels stupid.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well for months, maybe treading years now I have been talking about this, so many times in pasts posts; so here is the reasoning: <br />
<br />
-Tanks don't worry about threat, why should they? A stupid simple transparent number that you obligatorily have to keep track off isn't fun. -What is fun for tanks then? Panning to see how the field of play is going for party members, pick up loose adds, focusing more on when to use mitigation spells (they are tanks, their job is to MITIGATE damage) because a great tank will tank minimal damage using his skill, not stats. Also if surviving isn't an issue worry just then about unloading and positioning. <br />
<br />
-Shifting the focus from threat being the challenge of tanking to mitigation being the main challenge seems way more appropriate for a role that is put in place to TAKE LESS damage than other players/roles in the groups. Instead of trying to perfect (sometimes illogical) rotations for threat (blood and thunder for warriors comes to mind), rotations can be made to be about mitigating large portions of damage. <br />
<br />
<br />
Ideally with random numbers and assumptions off my head thrown in I would so a skilled and good tank, that knows the best way to mitigate appropriately and skillfully, will probably mitigate 10-25% more damage than a typical tank. I hope for more of an impact than just 10-25% but I think more tweaking to base tank mitigation and all end game content might need to be made to match it unfortunately.</div></div><hr />

What Blizzard is alluding to, I am not 100% certain but more like 95% sure that tanks will NOT focus on threat as much anymore, INSTEAD they will focus on MITIGATION abilities and timing them along with the typical positioning stuff.<br />
<br />
<br />
So the main goal seems to be, instead of worrying about whether or not everything that needs to beating on you is, you will be worrying about timing your defensive abilities (hence the death strike mentioning on the post). Hopefully death strike style gameplay will be much larger of a role, this time it looks like it may be, for all tanks at that.<br />
<br />
You may say he mitigation is simple as is, but I am very certain it will be changes in the future to be more available - less CD controlled- and more about resources and appropriate timing.</div></div><hr />

The problem is, with firelands being as easy for tanks as it is (its more a raid for dps and healers) we have more than enough time for both, if you take away one thing such as threat, why even bother? Mitigating damage is easy, building threat was the one real challenge</div></div><hr />

<br />
I edited my last post because I didn't clarify it, i'll mention again, here though. They may make mitigation more of an active role, which means based on player skill, and from its current form, &quot;harder&quot; as well, because now you can mess up, maybe there will be much more to actively pay attention to.<br />
<br />
Likely you will see tanks getting their damage abilities coupled with a defensive effect as well, not all but some.<br />
<br />
This also means in the future if Blizzard goes steps further boss will have multiple mini enrages and burst moments, Blizzard could make it so you constantly gotta be hitting these defensive abilities to counter them.<br />
<br />
<br />
This is all in assumption, but seems very likely.</div></div><hr />

Mitigating damage is easy, building threat was the one real challenge<br />
<br />
Prot paladins and warriors have too much passive mitigation, that is why damage mitigation on them is easy, our active mitigation is pretty much limited to using -dmg cooldowns on hard hitting abilities.<br />
<br />
As Jayremy pointed out, the next step after the threat buff is to shift away from automated passive defenses of shield tanks and bears (passive shield block/absorb + avoidance), and into a DK like playstyle where in addition to managing the -%dmg cooldowns, you must also learn to synchronise your active defenses (self heals/absorb shields in case of DKs) with the bosses attacks - instead of running a dps rotation routine 24/7.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you have read carefully GC's blog, their main concern is - what is defined to be &quot;fun&quot; for a tank?<br />
<br />
I agree with GC here, that threat is indeed a boring stats. If a tank sets up a rotation or uses his abilities just to maintain the highest threat, it is not fun. <br />
<br />
Blizzard's idea is to make Tanks' rotaion more focus on survival rather than threat generation. <br />
<br />
This doesn't mean to make tanking easier, which most people obviously misunderstood here, but to make tanks working harder and engaging more with their survival rather than threat generation. This can actually be fun. You have to admit that current DK tanking model is more fun and engaging than passive shield tanks or druids</div></div><hr />

Probably they can. The Zandalari Dungeons differ vastly from the rest of the game. until heroic 80 dungeons the Damage Dealers could mouthbreath and DPS race each other, without big problems. In cata dungeons, they have to be more alert, but most of trash mobs are easy to mouthbreath if you're geared enough.<br />
In Zandalari Dungeons, Blizzard made a legitimate effort to damage dealer actions MATTER. They have to do more things than DPS race each other. It's not up to the tank and healer only to deal with packs. It's a really great preparation for raids. <br />
Thing is that most people still believing the old paradigm of DPS being easycake. Just rotate the highest damage skills and you're awesome. Well, you're NOT. You're a retard that make everything harder. Damage dealer have multiple roles. Disabling mobs, crowd control, relieve the tank from have to interrupt, control positioning. Blizzard gave multiple tools, that DPS are ignoring because they thing all they have to use is big numbers damage.<br />
<br />
What the developers have to do now is scream &quot;Yo, retards, Damage dealers are not only about damage! Learn to play, because you're scaring the tanks and that 40 minutes wait in dungeon finder is all your fault. DEAL WITH IT, or keep crying. Your choice.&quot;<br />
<br />
P.S.: I can't remember when was the last time I pulled aggro from trash, and I had the boss more than 1 second on me (because a demo Lock that made my damage skyrocket with stacking buffs I had) on my hunter. So, yes, Tank losing Aggro is 90% chance of a lousy DPS, and this threat hotfix is not because blizzard lousy design, but because of DPS lousy play was punishing Tanks.</div></div><hr />

If you go into a dungeon with a guildie that is still gearing 350ish while your dps gear dropped from heroic FL bosses, you know not to be an idiot with your threat. With RFD groups, just link threat to the Luck Of The Draw buff. Only 4 specs can tank now (increase the effect/shorten cooldown for kitty's Cower), so those specs become exempt to the additional effect of &quot;5% threat reduction per random in the group (stacks up to 3)&quot;. Make it 10% if it still doesn't prove to be enough. This blanket nerf for threat really isn't needed for raids, guild runs or anything where sensible players are involved.</div></div><hr />

Making tanks more engaged with their survival can be very interesting. But on the other hand, what worries me is the class homogenization.<br />
<br />
If they change the pally/warrior/druid tanking model to dk's active CD management model, blizzard has to redesign a lot of abilities to match dk's similar abilities, for balance issue, and inevitably results class homogenization. <br />
<br />
I still prefer each class has their uniqueness and different tanking style. But balance and homogenization is really a dilema.</div></div><hr />

Sounds good.<br />
<br />
If you read GC's post carefully, you will see the long-term goal is to shift tanks' focus from threat management to survival management. <br />
<br />
This will actually affect raids more than random heroics, since Tanks' survivalbility is not really an issue in random heroics. And all tanks will need to work harder on their cooldowns and ressource management for survival, and have more controls over it, like today's DK tanking style. <br />
<br />
Threat level change is just the 1st step towards this long-term goal.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I think anyone who doesn't understand the role that threat has played is just being to elitist here or mainly raids with the luxury of misdirects. I just had this discussion with someone the other day, that the reason queue times are so high is because tanking right now is so hard. If you join a random dungeon in 359 gear and have a dps sitting there in 370+ gear ripping threat off you and calling you bad for not holding threat.<br />
<br />
My bear tank has ~360ilvl, I'm often asked to tank runs for a decent guild on my server where people are ~375-380 geared because they know I can keep up, hold threat (~35k tps without luck of the draw) with my 353 ZG staff and not do dumbass shit (most of the time :p ). Threat ATM in NOT impossible with geared dps so long as you all know where you stand.<br />
<br />
(anyone calling bs on the tps can go find out what a full agil geared druid tank can push when actually using more than 1 button/min, also have a less geared dk that I went with up until 4.2 before the druid so it isn't a question of &quot;dps rotation as a tank&quot;)<br />
<br />
<br />
Aside from the abuse you have to worry about pulling the mobs gathering them up and you have 3 dps single targeting 3 different targets that your expected to hold threat on but there are also mechanics you have to deal with. As a warrior you charge only to have the arcane mage pop all cooldowns except mirror images (because it still has a minute left on the cooldown from two pulls ago) and now you play the taunt game as the mage rolls 60k dps and your only capable of maybe 40k tps but now your nerfed even more on threat generation as the mob runs away from you and is out of range of anything but your taunt. I can't tell you how many dungeons I join as a tank already at the last boss because the previous tank just gave up on the group.<br />
<br />
Then that's a tard dps problem, it's as much the dps' responsibility to watch their threat and introducing this change will cause even less hunters/rogues to know wtf their misdirect ability is compared to now.<br />
<br />
<br />
I just feel this is so braindead dps can go &quot;MOAR NUMBARS NOWS!!&quot; with even more of both tanks and dps not having a fucking clue wtf most of their abilities do.<br />
<br />
<br />
Managing my survival was never an issue with the DK, swapped because DK AoE threat is just plain bursty and uninvolved (30sec cd on the only actually useful ability).</div></div><hr />

1. The game/tanking is easy. This makes it faceroll. <br />
A. Actually, content dictates difficulty. If you saw threat management as a challenge you had to &quot;overcome&quot;, you're not the quality player you want us all to think you are. <br />
<br />
2. Devs are wasting their time on changes that affect of the population instead of , where changes are really needed. <br />
A. How did you get such inside information in an industry where techniques behind the design are generally kept under wraps? Oh, you don't know, you're just speculating? Cool. <br />
<br />
3. Fanboi <br />
A. Idiot-paying-for-a-product-he-doesn't-like-boi. <br />
<br />
Overall, this change helps the intended audience and does nothing to those outside of it. Hell, maybe they'll even be able to squeak a little more survival out of the change, even if it's just an extra GCD or two. <br />
<br />
There's no reason to complain about this. Threat is a minimal factor in ideal situations, and a strong point of frustration in others. Evening it out without impacting either side negatively is what you SHOULD be asking for in design changes.<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Prot paladins and warriors have too much passive mitigation, that is why damage mitigation on them is easy, our active mitigation is pretty much limited to using -dmg cooldowns on hard hitting abilities.<br />
<br />
As Jayremy pointed out, the next step after the threat buff is to shift away from automated passive defenses of shield tanks and bears (passive shield block/absorb + avoidance), and into a DK like playstyle where in addition to managing the -%dmg cooldowns, you must also learn to synchronise your active defenses (self heals/absorb shields in case of DKs) with the bosses attacks - instead of running a dps rotation routine 24/7.<br />
<br />
I fail to see how i am contradicting myself, tanking firelands is EASY as hell, managing threat + mitigation via CD is no big issue, im stating the facts, if you cant handle threat + mitigation, stop tanking, you just dont have what it takes, done make threat easier so nobrainers can keep threat while tryine to figure out wheter to hit 1 2 3 or 4.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because if it is so easy to you then what is this challenge you speak of?<br />
<br />
Also why are you trying to impose a barrier for entry on other tanks if this wont affect you because since it is easy already, it must not be challenging to you, so neither way change or not wont affect you, only others. Why are you for blocking others from benefiting?<br />
<br />
<br />
Also this state is likely to be temporary, tanking will never be an &quot;AFK&quot; role with these changes, or maybe not even &quot;easy&quot;.<br />
<br />
In fact tanking can be a lot like DPS, something you can perfect and maximize. What does all that extra threat do for you exactly? Nothing.<br />
<br />
What does milking every inch of extra mitigation based on smart use of skills (timing and rotation) do for you? It saves the healing needed for you, your survival (even w/o heals) and allows you to impact your entire raid by allow healing to spare more heals on themselves and DPS players.<br />
<br />
Regardless if it is easy or hard, there is a more meaningful way to progress your skills as a tank on the long term of things.<br />
<br />
Besides my point here, I think to need to read the whole blue post of their intentions, and you will see they already stated against what you are arguing, making it nearly pointless to argue, unless you are flat out going &quot;Blizzard is lying&quot; if you can't trust Blizzard here why would you trust them other times? Or even play the game if its the same devs making it that keep you here.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What is now being taken away in tps buttons needed to push, is later made up for with mitigation buttons to push. This is good, because tps behaves always the same, you land attack, you make threat, mob stays on you. There is little variance to be had to the TPS game either you keep agro or you don't and as you said with firelands vengeance it's a challenge not to keep threat on most fights.<br />
<br />
We've established that currently keeping threat is p1ss easy, it's also been repeatedly said in the blue post and in this thread that this is why they are moving away from trying to make threat a challenge, and instead make staying alive a challenge. This is good.</div></div><hr />

The solution? Make tanks choose hit/exp? How about keep the old system, and add an avoidance-based element on top, where avoiding an attack generates significant threat, to the level where dps cannot out-threat after a few dodge/parry. Sure you dont want tanks afk and do 0 dps, but what actual sense if you think about it, is in a tank hitting? Isnt a tank about taking being hit? hit/exp should be a dps and pvp stat!<br />
<br />
<br />
and about pvp (rated bgs), I guess it might actually be a buff? someone work it out, but I would think hitting a CC'd target (fear/rep etc) as tank spec will now reward instant Vengeance (read: dps boost), then when the target breaks CC and hit you, you will gain even more. This is as opposed to currently starting with no vengeance on a CC target until they break out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If they change the pally/warrior/druid tanking model to dk's active CD management model, blizzard has to redesign a lot of abilities to match dk's similar abilities, for balance issue, and inevitably results class homogenization. <br />
<br />
I still prefer each class has their uniqueness and different tanking style. But balance and homogenization is really a dilema.<br />
<br />
It's not just the class homogenization that worries me in this new design philosophy they're working towards. A skill cap for tanks is fine.. but if you start designing boss encounters to require the tank to use a large arsenal of different mitigation cds, then the average unexperienced tank might be overwhelmed by the task of managing his survival by himself. DK tanking does require a fair ammount of practice.. otherwise they can be very squishy.</div></div><hr />

Watching your health bar to decide when to DS for the best benefit is far more engaging than Savage Defense, and really enjoyable.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SilverKnight</div><div class="date">2011-08-17, 02:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The only time threat actually mattered was when playing with idiot players (so pretty much every DPS in LFD) or if you were severely outgeared. I've also heard it was problematic in progression fights, too. So, as a person who does tank, doesn't raid, and uses LFD pretty much exclusively, this will do very little for me. If you blow all your CDs before I get a Swipe off, you should die. (And, in fact, you're STILL going to die, even after this change, because I'm going to stand there and auto-attack while they swarm your dumbass, then I'll go back to tanking for the rest of the non-retards.) If you play like an idiot, you should be punished for it. STOP REWARDING BAD GAMEPLAY. <br />
<br />
Also, don't many DK tanks actively dislike having to use DS at the exclusion if nearly everything else? Having active mitigation is fine and dandy, but when it becomes a, &quot;USE X ABILITY OR GET GIBBED&quot; situation, is that really adding more thought to the process, or just making tanking that much more punishing in a more overt way? I hope Blizzard realizes that for every player they win back to the LFD (the ONLY they're doing this, mark my words) with this change, they're going to lose that many and more when they have this whole &quot;DK-like revamp&quot; of the other tank classes go live. Why? Because DK TANKING SUCKS. And this is coming from somebody who enjoys DK tanking's versatile and 'mobile' nature.</div></div><hr />

Threat was hardly doing well in BC. Remember, everyone HAD to have Salvation on them from a pally or else tanks would lose threat and people would die. I wouldn't call that exactly &quot;good.&quot; I remember healing back then and being the only resto druid, so I'd get the crappy 5 minute Salv buff from our pallies. If I didn't get it back on me in the middle of the fight when it wore off (I had to make a macro to spam it to get it on me) in fights with adds (sometimes with only single target as well) I'd pull aggro and die. This was with well geared and skilled tanks throughout BC from Magtheridon to Sunwell. It was even worse for dps.<br />
<br />
This change is minimal for those who are already doing their job minus some situations, and majorly helpful to undergeared/skilled tanks.</div></div><hr />

They are fixing something that isn´t broke. Ok, so now we rotate among active damage abilities.... they are going to increase tank threat, which means we will mostly just be spamming AOE abilities now.... and then they will spend a lot of time ´fixing´our active survivability abilities (shield block etc).. and in the end, we will still be just pushing a few buttons while worrying about positioning and not standing in crap... it will feel exactly the same.<br />
<br />
My whole ´hate´of this is that it is big waste of time, where the developers are walking themselves in circles changing something that isn´t broken, and won´t be any better after the change. It will NOT make the game any more fun for most players. The devs need to learn that this is a game, not a science project.. they need to start adding fun back.<br />

I highly doubt perfection of mitigation will be a requirement, likely it will more so be a thing that has a sizable margin for error, that is what it will be balanced around.<br />
<br />
I great tank when it comes to mitigating things will be able to go above the expectations, where likely content will be balanced around a mediocre player, not a pro player or a bad one.<br />
<br />
Bad players will likely not be hit very hard, at least no more than threat already has wasted them on, mediocre and highly skilled ones will have something more dynamic and or to work to.<br />
<br />
I think the goal being, what is &quot;fun&quot; is appropriate. There will be always good amount of lead way when you design content around player skill versus raw data/numbers (like dps spec rotations to gear ratios and such).</div></div><hr />

<br />
in tank swaps: tank 1 tanks for a bit, maxes vengeance, tank 2 taunts.<br />
<br />
unless tank 1 completely stops attacking (and can still have effects in the air) they will likely pull aggro back immediately over the new tank that has no vengeance.<br />
<br />
<br />
hit and expertise is still boring here. i see this long blog post which amounts to &quot;we're making threat more.&quot; it changes nothing about itemization (boring), stacking to 102.4 and having a DPS tank set for certain fights.<br />
<br />
the survivability a tank adds from pressing buttons is completely arbitrary, every tank can practically AFK currently. Here are the fights for me as a paladin tank:<br />
<br />
shannox: tank the one dog. when spear is thrown run away, daze them. move away from traps.<br />
bethtilac: taunt a spider off a rope, go up. when is about to blow up, go in hole. when comes down tank it until stacks then run out. taunt back when other tank has stacks.<br />
rhyolith: adds pop out, threat them away from people especially healers with ae aggro. when boss comes taunt it. might as well use DPS/threat gear because nothing hits hard.<br />
alysrazor. grab egg, pull to worm just to kill worm fast. pull to other worm when tantrum. dps gear rotation, cooldowns useful at tantrum but not really necessary. interrupt adds. wait till 5 stacks on other tank and taunt bird. do that a few times.<br />
baleroc: other tank gets 3 stacks, taunt. then taunt back after tank gets the rape blade. zzz.<br />
majordomo: tank scorp. on cat, switch to add and position after leap so they're both facing. zzz.<br />
ragnaros: taunt off tank at 4 (annoying aggro issues here if vengeance and knockbacks are bad). taunt scions. zzz.<br />
<br />
<br />
None of these fights in regular are made more interesting by requiring me to push a button for mitigation, or threat problems. The bottom line is threat is automatic with 0 hit and 0 expertise due to vengeance if the dps waits like 20 seconds to really go all out at the outset of a fight. <br />
<br />
<br />
Really blizz needs to fess up that the reason for this change is that a raid geared tank ABSOLUTELY SUCKS in 5 mans for threat unless they cap out threat stats... no time for vengeance / too much mitigation, and no tank bothers doing dungeons and having a dungeon set if they're raid geared anyway. It is no fun for a tank to go into a dungeon with a DK putting AE dots on everything immediately and pingponging threat where i'm relying on autoattacks and procs to multiply a magic number? Complete shit.<br />
<br />
<br />
How about this, remove vengeance and have every dps and healer slowly gain a stacking &quot;lowers threat&quot; debuff. It's not fun, right? So why inflict that on tanks.</div></div><hr />

I primarily will have threat problems at the start of fights and in aoe tanking(play a druid). This will allow me to focus much more on my role in the fight. It will also allow well geared dps to dps normally when they are paired with a lesser geared tank in the dungeon finder. Those who are whining and complaining about this change can go drown in their tears.<br />
<br />
Tanks rarely have threat problems with mobs they have hit. Most threat issues in 5 mans come when DPS jumps the gun on adds and attacks something before we get any hit at all on them. My biggest problem tanking heroics is when a ranged hits something before I do, then gets it out of range of my swipe, which just means i have to taunt.. no big deal.<br />
<br />
The problems that happen in the first 15 seconds of a pull are still going to happen because you can multiple 0 threat as many times as you want, and it is still 0 threat.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Maybe maybe not, but in the near future if that was all you did, you would die because the healer couldn't heal you. Issues being is all that &quot;passive&quot; mitigation is going to be nerfed, you are now going make use of active mitigation in place of threat building abilities.<br />
<br />
There will be room for error on the mitigation, but mitigating damage is something you wont just leave it up to gear to do, but timing and wise choices of managing resources.<br />
<br />
Full fruition of Blizzards plans will not take place til weeks maybe even months from now.<br />
<br />
Prepare for some sweeping tank changes, for all tanking classes, even DKs in the future to fulfill this goal.<br />
<br />
TRUST ME for whatever reason you can find, it will likely be the best for everybody. Stop looking at the changes to threat and ignoring the fact mitigation will come into play. Try to imagine the fun things that would come from that style, again &quot;try&quot; to and you will likely understand.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, I'm at combat table coverage cap right now: every attack at me is either dodged, parried or blocked. I've killed regular rag this way. I'm pretty sure I could do the entire raid without ever pressing any activated cooldowns, even holy shield.<br />
<br />
With 0 hit / expertise, I wait about 20 seconds of doing a perfect rotation to have more threat than anyone could pass if they tried. Now that time will be reduced, so my &quot;dps abilities&quot; will go in the toilet. Except oops, they have fights like alysrazor where i have to do dps to kill the birds, so they can't just replace dps with mitigation.<br />
<br />
Taking my current stats of being as capped in combat as you possibly can be, them just making it so that i have to activate my mitigation doesn't change anything or make the game more interesting. It's a mindless rotation either way, right?<br />

they simply won't admit that vengeance sucks, and they miscalculated (or something) about combat table coverage. They removed defense but essentially all that happened was mastery became defense and crushing blows became &quot;unmitigated hits.&quot; In fact its even MORE CRUCIAL to get combat table coverage as an unmitigated hit does more damage than crushings used to. Oops.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard realized that there will be issues with threat when it comes to random dungeons. I was in that position recently. A tank was about 346 ilvl gear and a warlock was at least 371 ilvl. The demo warlock decides to go all out once the tank pulled. This change will help undergeared tanks hold aggro from dumb DPSers who like to go all out with their high gear levels. When I told the warlock about it, he just saids its cool I soulshattered. Ugh... messing up the boss placement and all that crap, is not fine, especially with some other nub healer healing the instance for the first time.</div></div><hr />
