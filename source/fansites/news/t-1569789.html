Warlords of Draenor - The Everbloom<br />
Today we are taking a look at The Everbloom, a dungeon located mostly in Gorgrond with the final boss near Stormwind. You can see the Stormwind area (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/4173-Priest-Tier-17-Armor-Sets-New-Area-in-Stormwind-Blue-Posts-Curse-of-Naxxramas) in the outside world as well.<br />

<br />
Warlords of Draenor - Dwarf Male Faces<br />
The latest beta build also added some more variation to Dwarf Male faces. It appears we got a snapshot of work in progress, as the faces in this build are somewhere between the old and new faces from the Artcraft example (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2014/august/facesInProgress.jpg).<br />

Warlords of Draenor - Troll Artcraft<br />
We might see the Troll Artcraft this week, as this is the week after referenced in the tweet.<br />

Classes<br />
Right now resolve seems to be a lot weaker than vengeance in terms of healing, is that cause of the gear or is it intentional?<br />
Intentional. Tanks were way too self-sustainable in Mists. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/495006799884341248))<br />
<br />
Ok cool, I'm a fan of changes. On another note, will we see icon update to old abilities? Some seem outdated compared to new one<br />
Unlikely. Changing icons on people can be really jarring. Example: The icon for Presence of Mind (mage spell to make your next... (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/496002090087370752))<br />
...spell instant cast) has been an icon of a plate helmet, since launch. That makes *no* sense whatesoever. We tried changing it... (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/496002248447496192))<br />
...to this in Mists beta, and everyone was furious, despite being objectively more sensical. http://t.co/SBX5wWmkx2 (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/496002693580611584))<br />

Breath of Sindragosa should not have a 1min cd. It should be like Conversion (toggled on/off as desired for RP dump). #WoD<br />
Do you want to lose the pooling gameplay that it creates? Is that just too much complication? It's supposed to be complicated one (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/494994192221757440))<br />
And does that not just devolve it into being your sole RP dump? (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/494994436175044608))<br />
i guess it could be considered a 'big CD', but the dmg output needs to be much higher.<br />
Dmg output is intended that it's a single target gain. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/495006384031662082))<br />
<br />
&quot;Dual-Wielders favor blasting their foes with frost damage&quot;. Does this mean that DW is gonna use HB outside Rime too?<br />
Absolutely. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/495343986060443648))<br />
<br />
I thought Rune of Cinderglacier was going to be the new thing in WoD. Why was it removed? Just sticking to boring RFC again?<br />
Yeah, we tried it out and found that it wasn't compelling at all, just added complication. FC did what we wanted it to do. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/495384117937065984))<br />
<br />
With cinderglacier out of the picture, is the intent still for frost to use different runeforges? Ie 2x razorice vs FC+RI<br />
FC+RI. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/495616772100194304))<br />
<br />
Wouldn't you agree that it'd be better to put Obliterate on Frost's Mastery instead of buffing it's damage outright?<br />
No, that would not achieve the intended rotations. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/495643695623184386))<br />
I just want to make sure I got this right. So as 2H we want to stall KM to use it on Obliterate? Make us care about KM again?<br />
Yes. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/495649919899025408))<br />
<br />

Just wondering, is Sunfall and Insect swarm still coming for moonkins or are the current abilities set in stone?<br />
Sunfall is available via a glyph. Insect Swarm is not coming. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/495011480681447424))<br />
<br />
Does Astral Communion work with haste? Cast time gets lower and the bar moves quicker? Or is it considered a channel spell?<br />
It does get shorted with haste (consistent with all channels), but that doesn't matter since it's spammable. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/495741357973983232))<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ihunters.gif Hunter (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/271-Hunter) / Skills (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/hunter) / WoD Talent Calculator (http://beta.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#M))<br />
Have you thought about let Hunter pet Birds fly while the Huinter is flying liek flyable companions can already?<br />
This would involve some tech work, not likely for WoD launch but it's on my wishlist. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/495242452073472000))<br />
<br />
how will the SV rotation work? Will we want to pool focus above a certain number? Is there still an ICD on lock and load?<br />
No ICD on LnL. You may want to pool in order to burst. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/495384308563984385))<br />
<br />
Quick MM question. Any chance Sniper Training will have a quicker activation while the ticking buff is active?<br />
Nope. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/495633723451125760))<br />
<br />

multistrike doesn't proc of icicle intended or bug?<br />
That's not true. Multistrikes can Icicle, but Icicles cannot Multistrike. It fully benefits once, but doesn't get to double-dip. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/494994864975527939))<br />
<br />
Will Mirror Image snapshot the mage's SP in WoD or change dynamically over duration?<br />
Dynamic. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/495987419313741825))<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ipaladins.gif Paladin (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/273-Paladin) / Skills (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/paladin) / WoD Talent Calculator (http://beta.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#I))<br />
Any plans to make seal swapping feel less punishing (forsaking a gcd for each buff)? Making a swap generate 1HP maybe?<br />
The talent is meant to be more difficult to use but offer added benefits. It's a talent built around seal-swapping. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/495334094629109760))<br />
<br />
But you are fine with Paladin Seal dancing?<br />
For a talent that specifically does that, and just that? Yes. Or for AoE vs single target? Yes. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/495625459338465280))<br />
<br />

With the recent change to tremor, could we see an increase to totem health made baseline to offset? Even a critter could kill em<br />
That's what the glyph is for. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/495622894622240768))<br />
<br />
Why did you make Flame Shock spreads only do base damage? Defeats the purpose of Fusion talent and Unleash Flame snapshoting.<br />
It definitely does not defeat the purpose of either of those things. It's a limit on their power. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/495633079969394689))<br />

Any Sudden Death tweaks inc? Eg: double proc chance but executes only deal half the damage of a regular execute?<br />
Executes from Sudden Death won't use additional rage. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/495703041819959297))<br />
<br />
Art<br />
How are things looking for the quivers etc that were in the customization artcraft?<br />
awesome, we've built some of the models. No eta for seeing them in-game but we'll probably update in Artcraft periodically (artofcgrobinson (https://twitter.com/artofcgrobinson/status/495772918677504000))<br />
<br />
Character / Items<br />
i find it awkward after leveling to 100 that im still wearing legendary cloak and a few pieces of raid gear from SoO<br />
The alternative is &quot;I replaced my hard-earned legendary with a quest green, thanks Bliz.&quot; Dungeon gear should beat all of that. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/495046610649243648))<br />
<br />
Do tier pieces change from spec to spec with repecs (including set bonuses) similar to other head/shoulders/chest/gloves/legs?<br />
Set bonuses change between specs. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/495300902656282624))<br />
<br />
PvE<br />
Since heroic and mythic don't share lockout, does this mean you can do mythic same week as heroic highmaul becomes available?<br />
Mythic will be locked for an additional week, so you cannot. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/495045585502617600))<br />
<br />
I didn't care for that design, personally, but oh, well.<br />
Curious - what about it? Worth noting that in retrospect we feel HoF came too soon; most weren't done with MSV. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/495282692968046592))<br />
wouldn't a simple attunement(IE kill end boss) to enter the next raid instance solve these issues?<br />
But also psychology of &quot;aaaaa I'm behind, there's another raid? I'm not even done with the last one!&quot; (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/495326391420723200))<br />
<br />
Curious, Why aren't you planning to give us the old raid soloable buff for MoP raids/dungeons? Wont they be impossible at 100?<br />
No, your damage and damage reduction are much stronger against significantly lower level opponents in Warlords. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/495631341619122176))<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
Are there still new BG's planned for warlords? We haven't heard anything about them since Blizzcon.<br />
For expansion release, our efforts are focused on Ashran. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/495049110873849859))<br />
<br />
IIRC there was talk about making new &quot;War&quot; category for BGs with Wingergrasp, AV, etc. (or new BGs like them). Still on table?<br />
We like the idea but not a high priority right now. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/495225191346479104))<br />
<br />
Will unobtainable Wotlk pvp gear be available for transmog in WoD?<br />
.All previous seasons should be available on beta. If you find something is missing, let us know. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/495225588542894080))<br />
which vendors would I find them at? And does that include the old weapons too?<br />
Includes weapons. Should be Netherstorm/Tanaris right ? (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/495227097414385664))<br />
<br />
Vehicles yes. But why not destructible buildings (using dynamite, etc)? Destroy a bridge, force a change of assault approach e.g.<br />
We didn't want Ashran to be about siege and fortress warfare. We wanted it to be about exploration and world pvp. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/495332145460547584))<br />
<br />
have you guys ever considered allowing players to transfer CP to alts? i have 22.6k on my main, and my alt has a 22k cap<br />
No, we greatly dislike the idea of simply transferring Honor/Conquest from one character to another. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/495333604965101569))<br />
<br />
Why is rated arena being disabled for twinks?I know we are the minority,but how does taking rated from us benefit lvl100s<br />
Without a good sized population the rating system is easily exploited. It was never intended for low levels. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/495224813561331712))<br />
Getting rid of arenas for levels under 100 = Lots of twinks will quit wow = less people paying for wow = dead game<br />
Low level players can still do arenas using skirmishes, but they will not receive a rating or achievements. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/495392783419453440))<br />
But low levels do it for the ratings so they can boast about it Why not give us rating but no chievements?<br />
At that population level, ratings are easily exploited and pretty much meaningless. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/495393335796715522))<br />
It means something to the people that like to brag about rating <br />
They can do it at max level. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/495394585175003137))<br />
Well you've just made a lot of twinkers angry, lots of them are quitting so rip subscribers in WoD.<br />
Definitely willing to hear complaints, but unsub threats are not effective feedback. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/495397225535528960))<br />
We're still providing the ability to do arenas, but a rating system at that level with so few people is broken (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/495397469899870208))<br />
<br />
Reputation / Questing<br />
If my friend and I build different buildings at our outposts in each zone, can we still quest together<br />
Yes, it will only cause minor changes in most zones (1 quest line maybe). Gorgrond is an exception. (_DonAdams (https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/495334733451374592))<br />
However, in Gorgrond, you'll get bonus objectives in the areas for which you don't have quests. (_DonAdams (https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/495334899055067136))<br />

Well it looks like ours. Would be weird if an 'AU Stormwind' (though I'm of a mind that alternate history Draenor doesn't necessarily mean there has to be a corresponding AU Azeroth) looked exactly like ours considering the completely different history those places would have :P<br />

I'm guessing these mages were trying to get a portal to Stormwind working and evil plants took them over.</div></div><hr />

<br />
While I did love BRD back in the day, it probably took them far longer to design the encounters for these bosses than all the ones in BRD. I mean, an instance isn't terribly hard to populate if it has trash and bosses with virtually no mechanics. From an environment standpoint, the number of assets they used to create the Everbloom is also higher than BRD.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The only thing challenging about BRD was time. There was no difficult encounter. The only one you consider a challenge was the summon boss for the Tier .5 set. I remember doing BRD a lot in classic, and getting a group was a PITA because people only wanted to do specfic bosses and skip the rest.</div></div><hr />

I agree, but they're probably still working on them because all these faces just look like the same guy making different expressions. I hope the ratfink male.dwarf face survives this process.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Basically what happens is that there is only two sections: Our Azeroth (therefore, the Stormwind we know) and Draenor (the uncorrupted one).<br />
<br />
Because the Dark Portal is damaged, the Kirin Tor makes a few rifts to try to create a link between the two worlds to help send reinforcements to destroy the Iron Horde. They thought they were safe in choosing their location, but it was near this botanical place that eventually overruns their area. They are not able to destroy the link between the portals, so they have to defend it in case anything happens to come through now.<br />

Bro, do you even read. Twinking is still possible, just without a rating. Is a rating that important for you, go do it at a point where it actually makes sense, since that's the place where the devs are tweaking at: lvl 100.<br />
<br />
Seriously pitty those guys at the twinking tweets, making death threats on a very minor change in a game. What a bunch of dickheads imo.<br />
