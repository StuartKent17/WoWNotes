I stayed up all night expecting SOMETHING instead i was given nothing, all i'm basically being told is something i already found out a few weeks ago after logging into my toon, something that you generally announce PRIOR to it actually happening. Just a little bit of positive feedback for blizzard.. If you're going to do a blizzcon PLEASE don't make it annual, it's obvious that there isn't enough news for an annual occasion. <br />
<br />
D3 we learned about a small patch (it's not even a main content patch e.g. 2.2) the opening ceremony we found out about nothing related specifically to WoW, the world of warcraft movie as a virtual ticket owner i was not given a chase to get any actual video feed or trailer of some sort even though i payed $44 AUD instead i saw a bunch of pictures and characters relating to their actors. The current WoW Items, class changes and More.. Well..

Fun.<br />
I love these comments, pretty much the vibe I got too. <br />

people are leaving move on to other stuff<br />
Hopefully they're lining up for a Q&amp;A. :(</div></div><hr />

The 2004 and the patch 1.12 info on abilities is a flat out lie. Only a few new base spells/abilities were added from launch to 1.12: ferocious bite, gift of the wild, innervate, barkskin and frenzied regen. They literally decided to only pick all of the relevant abilities to the spec and a few extra pieces for the launch list, and then list nearly every possible ability you could pick up, while still putting 31 point into resto, for the patch 1.12 list. Really, words cannot even explain the rage.</div></div><hr />

It's not just that... in a game, there's not even a standard as to what is the &quot;normal&quot; speed. Maybe a ground mount is already &quot;fast-forwarding&quot;? Running?<br />
<br />
Anybody (on both sides of this argument) is stupid if he thinks he knows the ultimate truth because of &quot;facts&quot;. Deliver your arguments, but don't expect everybody to agree. Because personal tastes plays a role... which should be obvious to anybody with an IQ above zero.</div></div><hr />

Presence of Mind does more than mind control. Mind control is a cast + channel CC easily interrupted, prevents you from using your own character often doesn't let you use mob abilities or controlled players abilities. last less long if you take any hit, is on the mesmerize DR.<br />

I realize that all of the presented info isn't really that interesting or anything new to the super-informed frequent fansite goer that's aware of every tidbit of information and all the datamining and stuff. But to be fair, the panel isn't targeted at this sole purpose primarily.<br />

They're explaining their reasoning behind the changes and their design philosophy, and if you read that as them &quot;telling you what to think&quot; ... rather silly, honestly.<br />
<br />
Except for the fact that they have in many cases in the past told players that X thing is fun, even after players have told them it isn't. <br />
Your audience tell you if the content you make if fun or not. You can try to make it fun, but ultimately you can't tell people what is fun and what isn't because it's personal preference.<br />
&quot;Removing abilities will make the game more fun.&quot; - I'm really not so sure that's an accurate statement. I personally thing hunters are boring as shit now because they removed a tonne of their abilities and now each spec has 2-3 buttons to press as their rotation. It that fun? (luckily I don't play a hunter as my main)<br />
<br />
They could have said &quot;We removed redundant, complicated, and situational abilities because they didn't follow our design philosophies.&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
That really rubbed me up the wrong way. I can't believe they're still on this train of thought after Diablo III. After they fixed Diablo III by moving away from this exact mindset.<br />
A lot of the logic being ability pruning is really good, but when they say things like &quot;situational abilities aren't fun&quot; I just scratch my head and wonder what world of game design they're living in. With so much focus on &quot;fun&quot;, it's bizarre that WoD is one of the first expansions where many specs have become significantly less fun due to the removal of a lot of flavour/depth/niche stuff.<br />
<br />
It's like their core goal stems from a really well-intentioned place, but so much of it has been gone about in a baffling, inconsistent way that conflicts with exactly what they're trying to accomplish.</div></div><hr />

The team will look at what solutions players come up with for displaying combo points.&quot;<br />
<br />
They act like they've never even seen a combo point addon in this game's entire ten-year life. Basically, anything would be better than the current design. Combo points as they now are so small that it gives the impression that they're unimportant, and yet the are a huge part of the rogue class. Just make them bigger...like the holy power bar but on the target instead of the player. Also an option to detach the display and move it around the screen would be great. As it stands now any rogue worth their salt has found an addon that displays their combo points front and center on the screen where they should be, they just need to make that a possibility with the default UI (without also dragging the target frame along as well ofc).</div></div><hr />

Fully agreed.<br />
I know Blizzcon isn't about specifically WoW, but this is really..... bad.... I was jokingly talking about a year ago how they'd just read off patch notes....<br />

<br />
I'd expect information about upcoming patches at least, with preview images or concept art or something. <br />
<br />
Even they weren't expecting to be talking about this expansion for the second Blizzcon in a row, before it's even out and available. Whether it's here in a few days or not, it still makes better business sense to show that you have somekind of a direction going into the future. But it seems more and more that they're just kind of winging it at this point. I also expected to hear news about the next expansion, or a teaser or something, given their spouting off about yearly expansions or not. Not that I expect it to happen but I would expect them to at least tease it and imply it's going to happen to show that they are sincere whether it actually winds up coming out on time or not.<br />
<br />
<br />
I also expected as we've said over and over again, to have a bit more of a focus on the Warcraft universe this Blizzcon seeing as it's the 10th and 20th anniversary. But it seems aside from a movie panel in which only live visitors will be able to view footage, there really isn't anything much Warcraft related going on. (Unless you're counting Hearthstone and Heroes of The Storm which I don't think most would.)</div></div><hr />

Oh yeah? Is that a fact? Cuzzz...thats not what Im experiencing. Or is fun the new emotion tied to boredom, monotony, and dissatisfaction? <br />
<br />
<br />
Healing will be more tactical and allow players to make decisions while healing in Warlords.<br />
Tell that to my Holy Nova spam finger...its in pain from spammage. The only tactical decision I have been making is whether or not to spam Holy Nova or spam PW:S.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Even they weren't expecting to be talking about this expansion for the second Blizzcon in a row, before it's even out and available. Whether it's here in a few days or not, it still makes better business sense to show that you have somekind of a direction going into the future. But it seems more and more that they're just kind of winging it at this point. I also expected to hear news about the next expansion, or a teaser or something, given their spouting off about yearly expansions or not. Not that I expect it to happen but I would expect them to at least tease it and imply it's going to happen to show that they are sincere whether it actually winds up coming out on time or not.<br />
<br />
<br />
I also expected as we've said over and over again, to have a bit more of a focus on the Warcraft universe this Blizzcon seeing as it's the 10th and 20th anniversary. But it seems aside from a movie panel in which only live visitors will be able to view footage, there really isn't anything much Warcraft related going on. (Unless you're counting Hearthstone and Heroes of The Storm which I don't think most would.)<br />
<br />
Yup, that's what anyone should expect at the least from them; and always usually what they do...<br />
This is just shameful... Id say if there was not more to Blizzcon that they should refund people. (Its kind of not fair in that sense tho because of coarse its not just wow.) I find this offensive, insulting, and just wow talk about rub your subs/cash crop the wrong way.<br />
This is just wow...<br />
Like I said before that's so not right for all those people waiting all that time, making plans, the trip, the money...</div></div><hr />

I agree some abilities were dated and able to be combined / removed. But on several of my characters I've gone to hit abilities and then kinda felt like &quot;Well, now'd be a good time to fire this off, but its gone.&quot;<br />

The game is complex. And it could be hard for new players to figure it out. But hey. Several million players DID. We figured it out. We went online, we asked other players, we did trial and error.<br />

No Blizzard, people having fun playing other games while their WoW characters autoattack everything to death doesn't count as WoW itself becoming more fun.<br />
Yeah. Also, not being able to solo certain things that I could prior to WoD systems patch is fun! Not being able to farm older content as quickly/efficiently - one of the things keeping me subscribed - is fun!<br />

Nerf fun! Yeaaaaaaah! (⌐■_■)<br />

Absolutely not. I agree that redundant, confusing, mediocre, etc abilities are bad.<br />

But players want more abilities. More choices to make in combat, more complexity to master.<br />

Then what comes to combo point remaking, I really can't see the tiny points much because they are not in the middle of screen. So often I just end up guessing do I have points or not. Then I have to peek the points at upper left corner anyway and see there are many of them. I hit an ability key, but nothing happens. Oh yeah, I need energy too... I have to keep not pressing buttons, but have a rotation like first I press this, then this, so I should have combopoints and energy left, and can press finisher. But I still have to peek the bars at left upper corner to check what is going on, and I miss what mobs are doing. It is difficult to know, when the rotation has reseted (energy filled back up), even more so because I want to keep hitting sinister strike or such to do something.<br />
<br />
In real life I don't have to keep watching some ability bars... I just do combos. Maybe make it so that I can keep doing things, but if I have combo points, the effect is bigger. Also, in that case, too, I would want bigger bars to see do I have any energy / points.<br />
<br />
Or maybe replace combo points to having to press certain combos of keys to launch bigger and bigger moves. Not sure if that is good, though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I also would like them to do some better screening on the Q and A's. The questions they received were atrocious. Whining about holiday drop rates for a purely cosmetic mount, really? The game's 10 years old, you should know by now things roll dice every time. <br />
<br />
If I could ask a few questions, I would ask:<br />
<br />
1) I feel not updating holidays was one of the biggest glaring omissions of MoP. What changes will we see in Holidays in WoD, and what would you like to do going forward?<br />
<br />
2) What would you (the developers) consider a sign that WoD has been successful? Would it be simple subscription counts, or would it be some way of ranking participation, or some other metric you have access to?</div></div><hr />

<br />
They surely need to simplify things, too. When there are too many accumulated abilities, they need to select some abilities that will be used, and some needs to be cleared out. It is hard to balance game if there are odd abilities here and there. Also because people level up rapidly, there it becomes vain to choose tons of points and talents all the time.<br />
<br />
But other than that, surely classes should have some playability, too, instead of spamming one button. Rogues at least have some combo abilities, plus kick and gouge for situational play.<br />
<br />
I don't know what they meant by situational not being fun, but maybe they just meant that it is not fun having to keep changing from some abilities to others when you move from one area to an another. For example if you need to rebind your keys when you play against shadow monsters.</div></div><hr />

The best and the most accurate coment ever. <br />
<br />
Fire mage was fun before they took away our AlterTime, PoM, made bombs and Mirrors objective, removed Temporal Shield (in short all the abilities that made it fun). Now you can be an ameba and own in this spec. Guess that is what Blizzard wanted to achieve - eliminate all abilities that made dedicated players better than socials. But its kinda funny they found time to go to the forums and whine but couldn't find time to learn about their class. <br />
I have to admit that since 6.0 came out I am really not happy with my class (mage) changes and the worst thing they could do is to make bombs optional.</div></div><hr />

Then I have to peek the points at upper left corner anyway and see there are many of them. I hit an ability key, but nothing happens. Oh yeah, I need energy too... I have to keep not pressing buttons, but have a rotation like first I press this, then this, so I should have combopoints and energy left, and can press finisher. But I still have to peek the bars at left upper corner to check what is going on, and I miss what mobs are doing. It is difficult to know, when the rotation has reseted (energy filled back up), even more so because I want to keep hitting sinister strike or such to do something.<br />
<br />
In real life I don't have to keep watching some ability bars... I just do combos. Maybe make it so that I can keep doing things, but if I have combo points, the effect is bigger. Also, in that case, too, I would want bigger bars to see do I have any energy / points.<br />
<br />
Or maybe replace combo points to having to press certain combos of keys to launch bigger and bigger moves. Not sure if that is good, though.<br />

Now you can be an ameba and own in this spec. Guess that is what Blizzard wanted to achieve - eliminate all abilities that made dedicated players better than socials. But its kinda funny they found time to go to the forums and whine but couldn't find time to learn about their class. <br />
I have to admit that since 6.0 came out I am really not happy with my class (mage) changes and the worst thing they could do is to make bombs optional.<br />
<br />
Bombs optional is the best thing to happen. If I wanted to apply DoTs that bad I'd be raiding with a Warlock or Shadow Priest. <br />
<br />
And beside that, Fire Mages at its core was always centered around making a big Combustion. All that other stuff you listed was detrimental to that.</div></div><hr />

Perhaps I can't stand change but improving a game doesn't mean that you throw out tons of choices we had in the past. It started with Cataclysm and it's removal of talenttrees (we got a &quot;pick 1 of 3&quot; tree back.. woohoo) and now this.. Every class I play now only has 3-4 abilities tops in it's rotation.. whoopiedeedoo<br />
<br />
Thusfar; disappointed like most people here..</div></div><hr />

<br />
Odd how we can keep getting more and more abilities over the years, but when a few are merged or removed, it's apparently insulting our intelligence.<br />
<br />
But not when say, a macro mapped to scrollwheel topped dps for months and months.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's their game, they design the game and decide the direction based on feedback and responses from the community, and clear issues in their design process. Don't enjoy the new direction? Leave.</div></div><hr />
