PTR Patch 3.3.5 Notes<br />

Battle.net Real ID (http://www.mmo-champion.com/news-2/forum-avatars-battle-net-real-id/)<br />
World of Warcraft PTR Patch 3.3.5<br />
<br />
The latest patch notes can always be found at http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/patchnotes/<br />
<br />
The latest test realm patch notes can always be found at http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/patchnotes/test-realm-patchnotes.html<br />
<br />
General<br />
The Ruby Sanctum, an all-new 10- and 25-player raid featuring normal and Heroic difficulties, is now available for testing! Players will find the dungeon entrance below Wyrmrest Temple in Dragonblight.<br />
Copied Test Realm characters are not copied with their achievement history in order to better facilitate the character copy process.<br />
<br />
<br />
User Interface<br />
Chat Frame<br />
Players can now right-click on any chat type (Whisper, Trade, General, Party, Raid, etc.) and choose the Pop Out Chat option. This will move that chat type to a separate tab in the Chat frame which can be undocked and moved anywhere on the screen.<br />
Using the Pop Out Chat option on a Whisper will place the conversation with that player in a separate tab.<br />
Any time a conversation with another player is put into its own tab, the tab will glow when a new message is received.<br />
Hovering over the Chat Frame and using the mouse wheel will allow players to scroll through chat text.<br />
Players can select Classic Mode under Interface Options to keep the Chat Frame functionality closer to what it was prior to patch 3.3.5.<br />
The Simple Chat User Interface option has been removed.<br />
<br />
Friends List<br />
A new icon has been added to the top left of the Chat Frame which will open up the Friends list.<br />
In addition to its current functionality, the Friends List will now allow players to add Battle.net accounts (Real ID). Players will have to confirm that they are friends in order for a Real ID to be added. Once Real ID friends, players can communicate cross-game, cross-faction and cross-realm.<br />
A new Pending tab has been added where players can accept or decline a Real ID friend request, or select the Report Spam or Block Communications buttons.<br />
Players can now select from three statuses which will be visible to their friends: Available, Away and Busy.<br />
A Broadcast window has been added to the top of the frame. Players can use this to broadcast a message to all of their Real ID friends online. This message will also be displayed under the broadcaster&#8217;s Real ID information in each friend&#8217;s list.<br />

&quot;Hell, it's about time !&quot;.<br />
The whispers functionality sounds like a poor implementation of the likes of other addons, but that is what blizzard do in many cases.<br />
Providing a sub-par version of a sucessful addon which the majority will still replace with said addon which is far superior.<br />
I use the equipment manager because I do not need automatic set switching, but I use omen still.<br />
Now if all the whispers would get their own tab automatically instead of us having to do it manually, then it might be getting somewhere.<br />
Pity the dreamchat addon never got anywhere, now that was impressive. Collapsible chat windows, and stacking where expanding one would collapse others in the stack.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
They only did that with Sunwell because they wanted people to still be able to receive their 2 and 4 piece bonus while gearing up with Sunwell gear.<br />
<br />
Ruby Sanctum will be the same ilevel as ICC, 251 for 10man and 264 for 25man. Most likely it will probably just drop random stuff like trinkets, maybe a few weapons and armor pieces.</div></div><hr />

Ruby Sanctum will be the same ilevel as ICC, 251 for 10man and 264 for 25man. Most likely it will probably just drop random stuff like trinkets, maybe a few weapons and armor pieces.<br />
<br />
True, but I'm still hopeful that they'll include Belt/Feet/Wrists that are the same iLevel as the current 3 tier levels for T10, not a level higher like SWP T6 was.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Are you sure?<br />
<br />
Official quote: &quot;You're likely to find some random pieces of armor on par with Lich King loot.&quot;<br />
See how it says LK isntead of ICC. So won't that mean we'll see items of leven 258 and 271?<br />
<br />
<br />
They also have normal and heroic difficulties, so we'll see 251, 264, and 277 gear at the very least, and possibly 258, 271, and 284 gear if they have items that scale the same as Lich King weapon drop iLevels.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Pretty sure the *only* thing it drops is trinkets. Don't quote me on that though. :P<br />
<br />
Wouldn't be a bad thing, really...though I'd imagine that it would be a mix of at least a few types of items, maybe trinkets and rings? If there's only going to be one boss that drops loot in there, and four difficulty levels (though you can only see two of them per week), that means if they had a tank, melee/ranged, caster, and healer trinket and ring on each, you could have 8 items in the boss's loot table on each difficulty.</div></div><hr />

This was clarified after they made that statement. They just used the term Lich King as a blanket term for ICC</div></div><hr />

Ruby Sanctum - Info Compilation / Preview [Spoiler]<br />
Most of the Ruby Sanctum have been pushed in this patch and it looks like I have enough data in my hands for a small preview. As usual keep in mind that:<br />
This is only a preview based on game files, I could be wrong on a few things.<br />
Ruby Sanctum isn't even scheduled for release for Patch 3.3.3, it will be added with Patch 3.3.5 and a LOT of things can change in so much time.<br />
<br />
<br />
Official Description<br />
As we prepare for the public testing phase of minor content patch 3.3.3, some players might come across information regarding upcoming content that isn't yet available. To avoid any confusion, we'd like to tell you about an exciting new raid dungeon we are working on for content patch 3.3.5.<br />
<br />
The Ruby Sanctum<br />
<br />
A powerful war party of the Black Dragonflight, led by the fearsome Twilight dragon, Halion, have launched an assault upon the Ruby Sanctum beneath Wyrmrest Temple. By destroying the sanctum, the Black Dragonflight look to crush those that would stand in the way of their master’s reemergence into Azeroth and to ultimately shatter the Wyrmrest Accord – the sacred bond that unites the dragonflights.<br />
<br />
The battle that is to come will surely deal a crippling blow to the Red Dragonflight, however, it is up to you to stop this unprecedented offensive and defend the Ruby Sanctum. First you must face the assault of Halion's servants, Saviana Ragefire, Baltharus the Warborn, and General Zarithrian, before squaring off against Halion the Twilight Destroyer, a new and deadly force in this realm.<br />
<br />
The Ruby Sanctum will feature 10- and 25-player content, Heroic difficulties and all-new rewards! Stay tuned for more information as we get closer to its release. <br />
<br />
<br />
More Details on the instance / Loot Table by Zarhym<br />
<br />
Number 2. The lieutenants are sub-bosses which will each drop an Emblem of Frost (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/49426/emblem-of-frost/). Halion is the main boss. While the activation of Heroic difficulty is different from the Obsidian Sanctum, the overall raid format for the Ruby Sanctum is very comparable. <br />
You're likely to find some random pieces of armor on par with Lich King loot, similar to the items Onyxia dropped while Trial of the Crusader was the top-tier raid. You can also expect to see some more trinkets and things of that nature. <br />
This raid will not only provide a bit of additional content to pair with the current content of patch 3.3, it will be the beginning of an advancement in the storyline for Cataclysm. <br />
The plan is to have a normal mode and a heroic mode just like Icecrown Citadel, so far there is no plan for a Sartharion +1/+2/+3-like encounter.<br />

Ruby Sanctum Loot<br />

Item - Chamber of Aspects 25 Heroic Nuker Trinket (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/75474/) - Your damaging spells have a chance to grant 861 spell power for 15 sec. (Twilight Flames (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/75473/))<br />
Item - Chamber of Aspects 25 Tank Trinket (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/75475/) - Melee attacks which reduce you below 35% health cause you to gain 4401 health for 10 sec. Cannot occur more than once every 30 sec. (Scaly Fortitude (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/75477/))<br />

Eyes of Twilight (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/75490/) - Each time your direct healing spells heal a target you cause the target of your heal to heal themselves and friends within 10 yards for 356 each sec for 6 sec. (Twilight Renewal (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/75493/))<br />
Eyes of Twilight (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/75495/) - Each time your direct healing spells heal a target you cause the target of your heal to heal themselves and friends within 10 yards for 402 each sec for 6 sec. (Twilight Renewal (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/75494/))<br />
<br />
<br />
Halion Supposed Skills<br />
These abilities are probably used by Halion. There isn't any way to confirm that before Patch 3.3.5 is deployed on live or PTR servers but they seem to be the only skills with hard mode versions. Assuming that you won't be able to activate the heroic mode on the mini-bosses, these skills are most likely used by Halion. <br />
<br />
Keep in mind that this is only a theory based on the game files. <br />

&lt;td style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt; I do not have a lot of details on Corporeality for the moment, but it looks like the % of Corporeality of Halion will vary during the fight. Corporeality increases damage dealt and damage taken apparently, ranging from 20~30% to 200% depending on the version of the buff. I guess it could be used by players as well, especially if &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/75486/dusk-shroud/&quot; style=&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;Dusk Shroud&lt;/a&gt; is running throughout the fight.&lt;/td&gt;<br />
&lt;/tr&gt;<br />
<br />
&lt;/table&gt;<br />
&lt;/div&gt;<br />
<br />
Mini-Boss Supposed Skills<br />
The remaining skills only come in two versions most of the time, it means no hard modes and they are most likely the skills used during the fight against the 3 mini bosses. There is no way to link skills to a specific mini-boss and I will just keep them together.<br />

Transcripts<br />
Last but not least, here is a transcript of the dialogue with Xerestrasza of the Red Dragonflight.<br />
<br />
RS_Xerestrasza_Yell01.wav - Help! I am trapped within this tree! I require aid!<br />
RS_Xerestrasza_Yell02.wav - Thank you! I could have not held out for much longer. A terrible thing has happened here.<br />
RS_Xerestrasza_Say01.wav - We believed that the Sanctum was well fortified, but we were not prepareted for the nature of this assault. <br />
RS_Xerestrasza_Say02.wav - The Black Dragonkin materialized from thin air, and set upon us before we could react. <br />
RS_Xerestrasza_Say03.wav - We did not stand a chance. As my brethren perished around me, I managed to retreat hear and bar the entrance. <br />
RS_Xerestrasza_Say04.wav - They slaughtered us with cold efficiency, but the true focus of their interest seemed to be the eggs kept here in the sanctum. <br />
RS_Xerestrasza_Say05.wav - The commander of the forces on the ground here is a cruel brute named Zarithrian. But I fear there are greater powers at work. <br />
RS_Xerestrasza_Say06.wav - In their initial assault I caught a glimpse of their true leader, a fearsome full-grown Twilight Dragon.<br />
RS_Xerestrasza_Say07.wav - I know not the extent of their plans heroes, but I know this: they cannot be allowed to succeed!<br />
<br />
Halion also has a couple of interesting lines. <br />
<br />
RS_Halion_Aggro01.wav - Your world teeters on the brink of annihilation. You will all bear witness to the coming of a new age of destruction!<br />
RS_Halion_Beserk01.wav - Not good enough!<br />
RS_Halion_Death01.wav - Relish this victory mortals, for it will be your last. This world will burn with the Master's return!<br />
RS_Halion_Phase2.wav - You will find only suffering within the realm of Twilight. Enter if you dare. <br />
RS_Halion_Phase3.wav - I am the light AND the darkness! Cower mortals before the Herald of Deathwing!<br />
RS_Halion_Slay01.wav - Another hero falls.<br />
RS_Halion_Slay02.wav - Ha Ha Ha!<br />
RS_Halion_Spawn01.wav - Meddlesome insects, you're too late! The Ruby Sanctum is lost.<br />
RS_Halion_Special01.wav - The heavens burn!<br />
RS_Halion_Special02.wav - Beware the shadow! <br />
<br />

Hopefully some time in the future they will also allow us to queue for randoms with people from other realms, at least from our own battlegroup, now that at least the chat system is fully integrated between ALL of the servers.<br />
<br />
Which brings up another interesting question... if I can talk to people in Starcraft and Diablo, can I talk to people on US Warcraft realms? Or are battle.net servers also divided by region?</div></div><hr />

You're not playing a single player game though. This is a MMORPG, a social universe. This really isn't the place to be anti-social so just don't add people to RealID who you don't want 24/7 access. The rest can be on your friends list in each game.</div></div><hr />

Go look at the rest of the patch notes... If I remember correctly there is slightly more than just those 2 but I could be wrong.<br />
<br />
Regardless there is a lot of stuff for just one patch, a public test realm is for testing out all the bugs and stuff (I'm sure you know this already, just saying) because the slightest thing can throw off another, so just be patient.</div></div><hr />

You prolly already did this, but may i suggest making a alt? I have been playing the same druid for 5 years, i quit every 6 months because i get bored of it, but this time i finally decided to make a shammy, which has always been my favorite class. Now even though i used to hate it im addicted to leveling, and i like the change of a shammy. Regearing up is fun because you can watch how fast your dps goes up nowadays.</div></div><hr />

True</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sunsmoon</div><div class="date">2010-05-11, 03:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This.

I'm also concerned about how you add people (getting their battle.net email address), and that it displays my real first and last name.<br />
<br />
My First/Last name (combined) isn't particularly common. Thus far I've found one other person referenced online with this combination. The first few dozen links on Google are my facebook, myspace, twitter, livejournal, and a few projects I used to work on (but no longer). My Facebook, myspace, and livejournal are all set to private (or as private as humanly possible). The details that are public are extremely vague. Truthfully? I have myself listed as being from a different city than I actually live in, but I live out in the wilderness, so if I say &quot;Hey, I live in Somecity, Somestate, USA&quot; I might as well give them my home address. My town has a population of about 100. I don't even use my Facebook or Myspace, aside from sending messages to friends about upcoming events, and those are very infrequent.<br />
<br />
Blizzard says that the easiest way to have your account compromised is to share the details with a real life friend. By giving my friends my RealID (AKA my battle.net email address) - yes, even close, real life friends - I'm giving them one half of the equation. Since the Secret Q&amp;A options are extremely limited, whatever I pick is either of public record or is something that multiple people will know.<br />
<br />
So now, should I chose to use this service, my friends will know my log-in name, likely know the answer to my secret Q/A, and if I don't guard my purse like a hawk they'll have access to my authenticator serial number (seriously, I can't ask a friend to hold my purse? :/) I might as well give them my World of Warcraft CD keys and my password, at this rate.<br />
<br />
But hey, that's assuming I don't have trustworthy friends. Lets assume the best - not a single friend or family member of mine is greedy when it comes to games. Well, chances are that one of them isn't very smart and happens to get their account compromised. Well, thanks, now my first and last name, as well as log in information, is known to someone who, quite frankly, I would not want with my information. Or lets say this friend isn't COMPLETELY stupid and doesn't get hacked, but instead they add all their in-game friends to their RealID friends list. Great! A bunch of strangers know my info! That's just as awesome! Lets say everyone uses the system the way it's intended. Sweet, my best friend's cousin's fiancee now knows my details. Who is this person, again? Oh right, a friend of a friend, someone that I don't know!<br />
<br />
And that's not going into how many guilds will likely REQUIRE that you become RealID friends with at least the leadership of the guild, so they can get in contact with you when you're playing even when you want to be left alone. I can count on one hand the number of guilds that ask you for your phone number when you pass your trial, especially if you're an 'integral' part of a raid (tank / healer). I've opted out of this in the past, citing privacy concerns. Now I'll have to explain how this new system doesn't alleviate my privacy concerns.</div></div><hr />

How to get patch 3.3.5: What you do is find your World of Warcraft Public Test file/folder and in that, find the PTR launcher which would just be named &quot;World of Warcraft&quot; It should patch right from the launcher. Hope this helps (:</div></div><hr />

I'll only strictly use it for 'real friends and family.' <br />

Mainly because I play both factions, and usually majority will play the opposite/one i'm not currently on. This way we can still talk in-game. That's the only use I see for it.</div></div><hr />

This, so much this. I've read nothing about RealID that's made me feel comfortable about just how much information is shared.

The drops could well be comparable to LK level, or at the very least to ICC drops since it is non-tiered content.<br />

Regarding RealID, yes you may want a break once in a while, and yes you want the cross faction/realm chatting etc, but we cannot really have it both ways.<br />
If you agree for it then you have to expect that people will contact you when you otherwise want left alone.<br />

It is in-game from what I can gather. It's just not limited to the game, and so you're able to chat with friends playing Diablo, Starcraft and such while raiding the Lich King.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, the people crying about giving out their realID... it's ment for close friends that you trust. Why would you even want to talk to someone playing another game if you don't trust them?</div></div><hr />

Except for the part where your friends of friends will see your real name/login name. So, if something goes wrong where a friend gets hacked, people that you don't want to know your details now magically do. I trust my boyfriend and my best friend, but neither of them use an authenticator. My best friend has even been hacked before. Not only that, but just because you don't play/socialize with shady people doesn't mean your friends don't know one or two.<br />

Its not that horrible of a change. Rather, I'm enthusiastic. It makes talking with friends so much easier... especially if they recently faction switched, transferred, or went to another game completely.<br />

I'm not whining about it, there's just nothing else on this blue post that's very interesting.

<br />
Here's the problem, though, and I apologize for the 3-pages-ago post reply here, but I feel like this needs to be said.<br />
<br />
If you refuse to add friends and such for RealID, then yeah, you are basically saying &quot;No, I don't want you to know every single one of my characters and when I'm on.&quot; This is akin to not giving a real life friend your phone number because you don't want to be bothered by them all the time. In the very end, people are going to be hurt.<br />
<br />
Buuuuut, the fact of the matter is, this is still an optional service. If you don't want to use it, then you don't have to. If you don't want to add a guild mate to the list, you don't have to. By the time I get the option of this service, I may only need it for one online friend and one real life friend. That's really it. <br />
<br />
I just see no sense in complaining about a service that you're not going to use because people you may not want to talk to every time they're on are upset that you may not want to talk to them every time they're on. Just the fact that it exists is not a good reason to demean the system.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The change makes sense to me, because &lt;DND&gt; is not very intuitively standing for Do Not Disturb if you don't play a lot of MMOs. Hell, I thought &lt;DND&gt; was a title or guild name for the longest time, having to do with Dungeons and Dragons.</div></div><hr />

We don't have an /anon command because it seems so counter to what MMOs are about. It would make the world seem a bit empty when performing a /who really. The idea has been brought up before but it wasn't one that was viewed as a benefit to the game or players in general.</div></div><hr />

This is a MMORPG, a social universe. This really isn't the place to be anti-social so just don't add people to RealID who you don't want 24/7 access. The rest can be on your friends list in each game.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I understand you're point, but the same could be said for any instant messenger type client, or facebook etc. They are examples of a &quot;social universe&quot;, but they have the option to show &quot;offline&quot;. Even in RL, your friends have your phone number, but you have the option of not answering the phone if you dont want to talk. It may be that you would never want to be &quot;unavailable&quot; to your friends, but a lot of people do want that kind of option (which is why its in just about all social networking programs). I have several good friends in WoW, and 99% of the time I like to be where they can see me etc, however like any relationship (RL or Online) sometimes there are things that cause problems and you want to go somewhere to &quot;cool down&quot;. Being able to log into (or even just create) a new alt to play when I want to be away from everyone is a good thing from my point of view. Now, with this new RealID, I have to choose. Either the ability to be able to talk to my friends whatever realm I am on (I play on two realms - and both horde and alliance), OR I can occasionally log into an unknown alt. I DO think that this feature should be implimented, but they have specifically said they arent adding it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Blizzard knows this too. That is why they are giving out the pet only with the collectors edition of SC2.<br />
If they really wanted to reward their fans they would give the pet (or something else) with every box.<br />
<br />
I mean... I got some special armor for Mass Effect 2 because I own Dragon Age on the same Bioware account.... and none of them were collectors editions. <br />
So I think it would be fair if Blizzard gave something to everyone that plays both WoW and SC2.<br />
It could be a different colored Mini-Thor (depending on what version of SC2 you have), but it doesn't even have to be a pet. I could be a title in WoW and/or a portrait pic or decals in SC2, ...<br />

<br />
Exactly! This new feature could be REALLY good - but the lack of a &quot;hidden&quot; feature will cripple its use IMO. This is a little like a new instant messanger system starting up, that links in your MSN, Yahoo, Facebook etc etc, and makes you public to any of your friends at all times, on any of these systems. Personally I think that is too much freedom on that information. I feel I may feel &quot;forced&quot; to accept people on my RealID that I may want to be able to get away from occasionally (however good a friend they may be).</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
True enough. However, I do think its fair enough to say that while its optional, it would be better if it had that very simple little feature that all other social networks have. Yes, you dont have to use it, and people will get over being refused &quot;friending&quot;, but it seems odd that they missed that feature out when every other social network has it. To me it just seems that like the &quot;addon&quot; features, Blizzard do have the tendancy to add something in that NEARLY does what others do - but miss the boat slightly. Of course, this is just my opinion - not saying that everyone has to agree with me:)</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you don't want others to see you on other chars/games than dont give them access to your RealID, it's that simple.<br />
The argument of &quot;Guilds will say its mandatory and people wont trust me&quot; is a complete load of b*ll*x.<br />
<br />
If a guild requests your RealID as mandatory than tell them to jog on, they don't follow your real life so they should not follow your gaming life, simples! They have you on the guild listing.<br />
<br />
As for people outside of a guild, just use the normal friends list.<br />
<br />
Blizzard have also stated nothing about removing /afk or /dnd either from in-game, they have only stated that they are having different status setups for the Battle.Net RealID system.<br />
<br />
If you don't want people seeing you play other chars/games when your suppose to be doing guild related activities that you signed up for than don't sign up for the activities in the first place...<br />
<br />
All arguments so far have been completely irrelevant and i fully support Blizzard with this move.<br />
<br />
News flash - Online gaming is suppose to bring people togethe. Blizzard are not the first to do this, Valve have all this technology already in Steam yet i see no QQ from the community over there.<br />
<br />
Complaining for the sake of complaining.<br />
<br />
As for the SC2 Collectors edition arguments, if you don't like the price tag than don't buy it... Last time i checked Blizzard are still a company out to make great products and services to make profit. Also the cost is quite reasonable for what you are receiving in the current economy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
(then again, due to preordering it before the price change, i only have to pay around 40 E's for it ^^)<br />
<br />
But overall, a very solid CE, you get.<br />
<br />
Game<br />
Art book<br />
Soundtrack<br />
DvD<br />
Starcraft 1+ brood war<br />
2 Gig USB stick<br />
Comic book<br />
Special portraits and decals to identify you online<br />
Special skin for Thor ingame<br />
Thor pet for wow<br />
<br />
Quite solid id say, compared to the WoW CEs that came with the useless card game (at least some of the exclusive cards can be sold). And of course, having both SC1 games on USB means i can also get down to playing it on my CD-rom-less comp, yay! ^^</div></div><hr />

The difference is that steam addresses BOTH the biggest concerns with this: You can choose to go offline in just the friends system, and it doesn't broadcast any info you don't chose to give it (like your real name).</div></div><hr />

You don't want people to know your real name don't give them your RealID than...<br />
<br />
Because giving your real name away to someone you play with is such a HUGE security concern/risk.<br />
<br />
Also note the fact that this is an OPTIONAL service and not mandatory.<br />

So you basically you want to able to talk to people cross realm/faction/game without knowing whether they are actually there or not and what character there on? That's smart...</div></div><hr />

Lets all hope it will be then. 8)<br />
<br />
But really, I doubt they can create a raid that wouldn't be a little disappointing to some, now that we've had a glimpse of Cataclysm and all the Epicness it has to offer.<br />
<br />
I'm also very excited about that cross-game/server system in the friends list. Finally some good use for BattleNet. ;D</div></div><hr />

<br />
just to clear things up - there will be no general cross faction chat. and that is good. but you could chat with people from the opposite faction via those realIDs - if they do allow you to do so. so don't think you'll now be able to flame the opposite faction in pvp - because you can't, and it will never ever happen! yay! ;-)</div></div><hr />

I guess this is awesome news (but not really)<br />

Also they already said you'd be able to talk cross-faction, as long as they accept the friend invitation or something.</div></div><hr />

Noticed with the update on the front page that the US version of the collectors edition from amazon will get you a beta key for SC2, but having looked on amazon UK that same bonus does not apply.<br />
Seems a bit biased to me.</div></div><hr />
