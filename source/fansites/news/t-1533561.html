Chain Lightning Hurls a lightning bolt at the enemy, dealing [ 28.65% [ 1 + 30.66% of Spell Power ] Nature damage and then jumping to additional nearby enemies. Affects 3 total targets. Shaman - Elemental Spec. 30.5% of Base Mana. 30 yd range. 2 sec cast. 3 sec cooldown.<br />

Are they really putting the cooldown back on Chain Lightning?</div></div><hr />

More guidance regarding what you're supposed to do, and the ability for us to reward bonus gold/XP for killing optional bosses<br />

Bloat also included according to blizzard abilities which generally were macro'd together.<br />
That is certainly a likely scenario there.</div></div><hr />

Where they really macro'd together that much though? Creating a macro would add a button instead of leaving it when the two buttons will be there anyway. Idk, I never macro'd them but if lots of other people did then I guess it makes sense.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Item - Monk T17 Windwalker4P Bonus (New) Fists of Fury generates 4 stacks of Tigereye Brew.<br />
<br />
Its A LOT! of TeB stacks generated by FoF making it most probably an opener coupled with Chi Brew for initial burst. This also makes FoF so mandatory that we will be most probably casting it on CD. Next.. maybe im mistaken but this makes me feel like a &quot;roguish&quot; gameplay where we will be focused to dump energy as low as possible when FoF is coming off the CD but also watching not to cap chi by doing so. With all that being said a glyph that allows us to move while FoF will be mandatory in that tier of content, obviously why.<br />
<br />
This is how i saw it on the first glance, maybe im wrong since i havent gone deeper in rotation.</div></div><hr />

You could macro to test for conditions like being indoors, non-flyable regions, in-combat etc that would take those and even a mount possibly down to one button.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Pretty much as CN said. For instance im currently using this macro on my shammy:<br />
<br />
- Mount - <br />
<br />
/stopcasting<br />
/cast [swimming] Azure Water Strider;<br />
/cast [indoors] Ghost Wolf;<br />
/cast [flyable,nocombat] Red Flying Cloud;<br />
/cast [combat,outdoors] Ghost Wolf;<br />
/use [nocombat,outdoors,noswimming,noflyable] Azure Water Strider;<br />
/dismount [mounted]<br />
<br />
- Target -<br />
<br />
/cast [nocombat, dead, help] Ancestral Spirit; [mod:shift, help] Chain Heal; [help, nodead] Healing Surge; [nomod, harm] Lightning Bolt; [mod:shift, harm] Chain Lightning; [@player] Healing Surge;<br />
<br />
First one is 3 bar slots in one macro which is auto changed depending on state. Second is 5 bar slots in one macro which are automatically changed depending on target and/or &quot;shift&quot;. Thats a good button squish, kinda looks odd, but as soon as you get used to it it makes life so easier.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It is partly to reduce button bloat but more so Druids can't complain about flight form not working in Draenor. Whilst they can make flying mounts usable on the ground they can't really do this with flight form without it seeming ridiculous. So, the solution is put all the travel forms under one umbrella spell where it chooses your form so you'll get used to the idea of flight form not being something you choose but something the game chooses for you.<br />
<br />
Just more fuel on the fire of the concept of Blizzard not ever allowing flying in Draenor I'd say.</div></div><hr />

Ogres for Hode race, and then Botani for Alliance race. :P<br />

You may think I'm joking, but I would go alliance to play as that.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mellrod</div><div class="date">2014-06-11, 03:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That armor looks badass. Seems the mythic version of shaman tier is far from boring, it even has little galaxies in the shoulders! I love the astral, shadowmoon clan theme going on there.<br />
<br />
I also think druid looks good so far, look like a cross between T1 &amp; T5. I like it.. i assumed it would have more arrakoan feathers but i guess i was wrong. Definitely looks druidic and i can't wait for mythic version. That staff looks AMAZING as well! This is all looking good so far blizz, keep it up!<br />
<br />
Also, to all those complaining about stat changes etc, if you're taking several minutes to read all that info, atleast take the brief seconds to read the disclaimers first:<br />
<br />
<br />
New build is going up was taken in the middle of making a large wave of changes; will appear unfair to some classes. It's just not done.<br />

<br />
your opinion on human males is subjective, the fact is that human males are currently the most proportionate race which is why all armor models are shown on them. Not for fashion - that's what you decide on YOUR character, this is just so you can get a good look at armor from all angles.</div></div><hr />

I'm not planning on buying WoD, and even if I eventually buy it my lock isn't high on the list of character I care about so I was thinking I'd just leave the quest until whenever since 90 is 90 is 90. Then I considered that maybe some of the 6.0 changes mess the whole thing up, making things worse for a bad lock and just did it..<br />
<br />
True. Locks get nerfed in 6.0 making it harder indeed. Anyways, thanks Blizz for the FOS. Tears+Forums really have an impact :p.</div></div><hr />

It might be in the middle of changes... but it still shows the favoritism of Blizzard towards certain classes over others. That is nothing new this expansion. Same thing as with the choppers. It was glaringly obvious who Blizzard wanted to win.<br />
<br />
It is never good when a developer can't come out as neutral. It creates all sort if issues and we see this again and again in WOW now. It ruins the trust that is needed for a good and balanced game.</div></div><hr />

I would agree, if the FoS + title would have been implemented either with patch 5.3 or 5.4.<br />
By now, even with simple LFR-gear, the boss became quite easy.</div></div><hr />

Well, it was more to do with my not believing them when they say secondary stats will all be equal and having to face an overnight change in a character that I already don't play much forcing me to deal with changes intended to be balanced at 100 while doing an intricate micromanagement fight. Nerfs really didn't figure into it. It was just the double whammy of class changes and game changes that could make the fight much more difficult.</div></div><hr />

Does Captainarlong know that references to tree people go back to the Indus Valley civilizations of about 4,000 years ago? <br />
<br />
Also trees with human personality were written about in the &quot;bible&quot; of fantasy stories, The Lord of the Rings. between 1937 and 1949?</div></div><hr />

Especially in regards to the character models, and doubly so since all the new models have only one face with a few minor hard-to-differientiate features. Ie, slightly more wrinkles, maybe a little shadow around the eyes. Nothing like the wide array you currently get with some of the races.<br />

But, c'est la vie.</div></div><hr />

Currently, it's actually 'Haunted Memento'. I really do hope, they are not getting rid of it... Chilling Memento is also BoP, the Haunted isn't.</div></div><hr />
