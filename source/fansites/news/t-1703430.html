<br />
If it does indeed award a pet I wouldn't doubt it if Blizzard reopens it up for a month or so as I'm sure there would be an uproar about giving a reward to something that previously only had a title to it and is no longer obtainable. Mainly for the fact that it's unobtainable unless they bring it back every anniversary event, but then the 10th part wouldn't match up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I wholeheartedly agree. I went through TM vs SM 9 times without a win. I gave up because the infuriation was not worth a title I wouldn't use.<br />
But to miss out on a Hogger pet, or just a Gnoll pet in general which I have wanted for years, due to a shitty imbalanced 2 month long event in which the Pet was not told was being rewarded for seems fucking shitty.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They did mention wanting to revisit SS vs TM in the future. If it's something that opens up for every anniversary, then the pet wouldn't be missable. It would also explain why they'd feel comfortable adding a reward to something that's no longer in game</div></div><hr />

I think those the Icons for the targets in the new Blackrock Foundry Missions. <br />
<br />
Also I really hope this &quot;Heroes of the Storm Promotion&quot; doesn't involve buying something like a Hero/Skin Bundle in Heroes of the Storm... I like the game and I play it occasionally but I don't plan on spending money on it.<br />
<br />
That achievement for the S.E.L.F.I.E. Camera is cool, I thought I'll never use the toy but I guess I was wrong :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
You are so dense, light bends around you... You can ignore this achievment and the toy completely. When will you people finally get that??<br />
I will not use any of that features, but do I angrily tell them to fuck themselves? No, because it's their game and they can do with that what they want. <br />
If you are so annoyed by that, just quit the game already and stop complaining you spoiled brat.<br />

Not to be a total dick, I completely agree. I REALLY hope they add the pet as a reward for the Hillsbrad win. All you needed was a WIN, that's it. I remember getting it day one, along with the rest of the achieves.. then I leveled a hordy alt, omg I must of lost 6 battles in a row before a win. Anyway, I hope they keep it in, BUT because pet collectors will REALLY pour a ton into the main forums, Blizzard will reverse decision because that's what they do, they fold in for people claiming they will quit the game over it.</div></div><hr />

You don't think it's weird to offer a reward for something you can't do any more? WoW is a game all about rewards, so all our decisions are partly based on what reward we will get. Some people do the BG without a reward, because they feel it's worth it for the experience alone, other people would do it if the reward was good enough (for them) and still other people wouldn't do it for any reward in the world. Having a reward is fine (I still wouldn't do that BG), changing it after the fact is just plain odd.</div></div><hr />

That depends. They have done some retroactive achievements and rewards before.<br />
This was a 10-year anniversary event, which won't happen any time soon.<br />
So it's quite predictable that there might be something more to it than just a FoS.<br />
<br />
And if not, you only spend 5 min ONCE anyways.<br />
<br />
But people like short-term thinking and then &quot;WHAT? That 10-year event actually rewarded something else? HOW DARE THEY? How does this event differ from all other events!?&quot; If you thought this event was insignificant then the problem isn't the pet reward really.</div></div><hr />

Most of us would not have had a problem suffering in that battleground until we got a win if we had KNOWN a pet was coming from it. To add the pet AFTER the achievement is unobtainable is just painful for serious pet collectors. I hope the pet is either tradeable, or there is another way to get it...because it just sucks if they add it after the fact and give us no way to go back and get it.<br />
<br />
Since when the 10th anniversary was out I decided not to do the battleground because there was nothing I wanted from that battleground. I did not care about a title and I prefer the fond memories I have of true tarren mill combat to bother seeing a clusterfuck in a battleground.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But that would ruin the fun of you and others whining about it.<br />
I mean, several other anniversary included an in-game pet for logging in during this period.<br />
This time, it was a much bigger deal because it was the 10th one, and it included a battleground and MC, which both granted different stuff.<br />
<br />
It's not exactly &quot;out of the blue&quot; or &quot;they have never done this before&quot;. It was pretty damn obvious it was a bigger deal. Now you paid the price because you couldn't be arsed to put down the time to get the FoS. Which, by the end, didn't take time at all.</div></div><hr />

For example, I wanted to suggest things to an indie developer but I didn't want to bother registering on their forums, so (since I had a twitter account already) I just tweeted them my suggestions and they replied (easy and done). Finally another example was that I had questions about a story from a game, so I tweeted the developers and they answered back. Again, easy and done. No having to register on their forums.<br />
<br />
It's that easy and it's straight to the point. It's a neat thing. The moral of the story, it's usable. It works. In fact if anything, it's the hipster thing people do on forums these days to hate on twitter or anything that works. What's next? Hating on youtube? Hating on forums? Hating on the internet itself (I am too 1337 to use the internet, so here I am complaining about people that use the internet on the internet itself)? <br />
<br />
Twitter is like Youtube. Before youtube, you used to upload videos to some site and people had to download a video or even torrent trailers for movies (yes, sometimes you had to torrent even movie trailers). The point is, you had to jump through a lot of hoops. Twitter is now an easy way to communicate with developers or companies or whatever without having to register on their forums or whatever. It is very straight to the point and minimal which is why I like it.<br />
<br />
The reason why I find it silly people are complaining about twitter on a forum is that twitter is a social platform. So people are complaining about a social platform on forums (which itself is a social platform) that also focuses on WoW (an MMO, mostly a social platform too) to &quot;express&quot; their opinions on a forum for others to read.<br />
<br />
It's hypocritical and ironic. So already on the first two pages, people complaining about &quot;I hate twitter because it's self important&quot; on a forum with the intention of getting others to read their (self important) opinions. Twitter is more used as communication rather than self important message. It's more of a social thing in general.<br />
<br />
Hipsters on the internet:<br />
1. They jump to hate on something to sound sophisticated (mostly to fit in with other hipsters). If something is liked by many, they jump in to express their opinions on how they like it too (even if they never experienced whatever that everyone else is liking). If something is hated on by many, they do the same (hate on it). Hipsters do the current hip thing to do, so they can try to fit in. On the internet (especially forums), this devolves to what we have here on these forums (people complaining about &quot;twitter&quot; on a &quot;forum&quot; dedicated to an &quot;MMO&quot;).<br />
2. Self important (they want their opinions to be heard).<br />
3. Most importantly, no coherent arguments for their position. A hipster posts their opinions mainly because they want to &quot;fit in&quot; with a certain circle of people (other hipsters). Hipsters rarely have coherent arguments for their position and only posts to &quot;fit in&quot; with other hipsters.<br />
<br />
Overall, I find it silly that this is being done on a forum dedicated to MMOs. When StarCraft II got Facebook integration, no one bothered complaining. It's hypocritical and ironic. Again, people here taking the time to express their &quot;self important&quot; opinions about twitter and selfies on a &quot;forum&quot; dedicated to an &quot;MMO&quot;.<br />
<br />
The only valid argument against these features is that it may take time away from the developers from developing another type of content but it is very unlikely that it took much time at all (I doubt it costs us a raid tier). Plus for the things people generally complain about (like balance, more content, etc), I really also doubt that implementing these features takes time away from any of that.</div></div><hr />

I'm pretty sure the game was set at 20-30 min, and if your battle group is unbalanced at all it can make a win near impossible. I went in a number of times and we always lost before we even reached the halfway mark (meaning we were being GY camped)</div></div><hr />

It's not as if there is just one level of social interaction. I obviously play wow to spot others in a huge, engrossing world, and I love that. I think the game has enough ways to communicate in text; I have no interest of integrating social media that pertains to real life into the game, as I can just alt tab or log off to get there anyway. In my eyes all it is is a joint-benefit marketing deal between blizzard and twitter; yes you can hopefully disable it but aspects will still linger, sadly. <br />

WoW is a game all about rewards, so all our decisions are partly based on what reward we will get. Some people do the BG without a reward, because they feel it's worth it for the experience alone, other people would do it if the reward was good enough (for them) and still other people wouldn't do it for any reward in the world. Having a reward is fine (I still wouldn't do that BG), changing it after the fact is just plain odd.<br />
Yeah. I did the BG, but didn't win, and didn't care enough about the achi / title to grind a win. If I knew there was a pet, I would have.</div></div><hr />

That depends. They have done some retroactive achievements and rewards before.<br />

Sure, nothing will make you feel more important than going on a gaming forum and telling people who voice their opinion that they don't matter and that complaining is for hippies. That kind of attitude is exactly what society today needs in order to feed on the brain dead consumers, who are so devoid of thinking, they'll buy just about anything as long as it comes in a nice box and doesn't smell like shit. Actually, just the box is fine. <br />
<br />
So, here we are, with the ever growing majority of people who think telling others that their opinions are just overreactions is incredibly cool. What's comforting though is that the crowd on the other side, the one with opinions, is still using their frontal lobe and sees that speaking up is where changes start. Because it's fine to draw the line somewhere. And it would be awesome, if it would be drawn at this stupid Twitter integration and selfies and titles like Photographer that do nothing but further ruin any kind of immersion. <br />

Some of us still like having movies and games as a world away from the world. Not a world where every single stupidity this civilization has constructed is copy/pasted and shoved in our faces yet again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's not exactly &quot;out of the blue&quot; or &quot;they have never done this before&quot;. It was pretty damn obvious it was a bigger deal. Now you paid the price because you couldn't be arsed to put down the time to get the FoS. Which, by the end, didn't take time at all.<br />

<br />
A really cool mount being added to the store, what happened to cool mounts added for people to achieve ingame? I mean come on, it's NOT hard to add a mount to the game. There's like 1 or 2 mounts on the store that are not unique and cool. Yet in-game we get 10 mounts that look the same and not unique at all. Well except the mount that drops from the last boss in heroic(current mythic) that very few raiders get, and will be super common in the future when everyone can solo it. I just wish there were mounts that you could get, that would be REALLY badass, that would require the same effort as the Insane title. That way anyone can get the mount if they're willing to work for it.<br />
<br />
When I see literally 90% of all players riding the same mount, I get bored of it, it's not cool or awesome anymore, it's just a mount everyone have, a super common mount. But when the mount is awesome, but super rare it's actually feels awesome to ride it. Not trying to sound like a &quot;special snowflake&quot; but I still think there should be awesome rewards for hard work, not related to killing last boss in a mythic raid or getting 100 wins in arena. I don't PvP, and I can't raid with a hardcore guild, cause I can't dedicate my life to raiding 4-5 days a week for 4-6 hours each time. If I could, I would.<br />
<br />
And also, seriously, adding a pet as a reward AFTER the event is over? I couldn't bother with this shithole of a battleground. Only thing you did was, alliance stand in one place, horde the other then try to grip players into your group and kill it. It was NOT a real PvP experience and was rather shit. I think anyone who played back in classic can tell this was not even 1% similar to how it went down in those large PvP fights in Hillsbrad. I mean come on, biggest fights were sometimes 200-400 people. Yeah few raids each faction going nuts. THAT was a fun PvP experience.<br />
<br />
I would've tried until I got it if I knew I'd get a pet, I mean I'm not a hardcore pet collector, but I would like to own pets that you wont have access to in the future.<br />
<br />
I literally feel like a worthless player to Blizzard everytime I come to mmo-champ and read what they're doing. I'm not even a veteran player in their eyes even after being subbed for total of 8.5 years, and account made on first day when WoW came out, dafuq.</div></div><hr />

Nobody is saying you can't have an opinion. But mine and others opinion is that it really is not a big fucking deal. Don't use the features! If a little twitter integration THAT YOU DONT HAVE TO USE and a selfie camera totally send you over the edge you should probably take a break from this game. I mean for fuck sake people have been taking pictures of themselves since cameras were invented yet now that the name has gone from self portrait to selfie it's just self obsessed garbage? Seriously get the fuck over yourself dude. God forbid someone take pride in their appearance and wish to share it with their peers.<br />

They won't even let you have real life names on RP servers. You can't make a toon called Sony for instance. It takes people out of the game and breaks immersion.
