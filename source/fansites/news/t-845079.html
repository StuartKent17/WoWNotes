Luck of the Draw Buff<br />
In case you aren't already aware, Luck of the Draw is the name of the buff you get for grouping with random people using Dungeon Finder. It currently provides a 5% buff to damage, healing, and health if you have at least one random player in your group. With patch 4.0.6, we are increasing this buff to 5% damage, healing, and health per random player, up to a maximum of 15%.<br />
<br />
In the process of working on this change we actually discovered that the Luck of the Draw buff has not been working in Cataclysm at all, save for a few specific dungeons. This means that the difficulty in almost all normal and Heroic dungeons for those using the Dungeon Finder tool was higher than expected. Still, with that issue corrected in 4.0.6, we feel the bump up to 15% for three or more random players found through the Dungeon Finder is a necessary change.<br />
<br />
The intent of Luck of the Draw is to help make up for the lack of coordination, communication, and familiarity that pick up groups suffer relative to organized groups of guild members and friends. Cataclysm dungeons, especially on Heroic mode, are quite challenging and ask for more group organization than the Wrath of the Lich King dungeons did. Therefore, Luck of the Draw became relatively weaker in Cataclysm. I'm painting the picture with unfairly large brush strokes here, but in general, Heroic dungeons are of appropriate difficulty for organized groups, but just brutal on Dungeon Finder groups. Players wonder, and rightly so, why Dungeon Finder supports Cataclysm Heroic dungeons at all when the chance of success is so low.<br />
<br />
We think buffing Luck of the Draw is a good way to go about correcting the difficulty differences because it makes things slightly easier on PUGs without depriving the organized groups of a fun challenge. We also think the bonus is modest enough that it won't encourage organized groups to split up and just PUG instead - - the success rate for PUGs relative to organized groups is just that far behind. We still think you'll have more fun and a greater chance of success running dungeons with friends, but when that isn’t possible, we hope this change will make Dungeon Finder a more pleasant experience. Also remember that patch 4.0.6 is adjusting the difficulty of some bosses that are particularly unforgiving, such as Ozruk in Heroic Stonecore, though to be fair, we are buffing some underperforming encounters as well. In addition, we are offering larger Justice Point rewards for players who just prefer the faster pace and greater success rate of normal dungeons, and by the time 4.1 comes out everyone will have access to more powerful gear, making the older content even easier. But then there'll be new challenges to face!<br />
<br />
We'd like to thank everyone who has provided us with feedback. We do listen, even if we don't immediately deploy every design change suggested by the player community. Our intent is to make the game fun for a wide variety of players, which can be quite a challenge when you have a community this large and this varied. We hope you continue to enjoy the game, and look forward to sharing more changes (and a few surprises) in the months ahead.<br />

All Rated Battleground Weeks Now 10v10<br />
We’re in the process of developing a hotfix to push before next Tuesday that will change all 15vs15 rated battleground weeks into 10vs10 weeks.<br />
<br />
Looking at participation, the 10vs10 rated battleground weeks have been far and away more popular than the 15vs15 weeks. The difference in organizational requirements as well as battleground map popularity have been a couple big factors that have led to the 10vs10 weeks seeing a great deal more action. By making this change and supporting the popular option we hope to encourage even more players and teams to participate, as they won’t have to wait out every other week, or struggle to beef up to 15 players to match the requirement.<br />
<br />
We also have plans to adapt additional battleground maps in the future to work in the 10 player bracket to increase the variety of maps available.</div></div><hr />

It's only a nerf if you pug. In a guild group, you won't get the buff.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">greyghost</div><div class="date">2011-02-04, 05:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I find this very acceptable. A very smart change, really, seeing how that the majority of the people complaining that &quot;dungeons are too hard&quot; are persons who rely on getting their whole group from LFG random and are quick to point out &quot;well I want them nerfed not because I'm unskilled but because it's the other people who are bad and I just want a fast dungeon run!!&quot;<br />
<br />
I rarely get more than 1-2 more PUGs via the LFG tool whenever I run with my guildmates. Most of the time never, though. But TBH +5/10% damage normally does not make up for the 5k DPS I see out of other level 85 players. :P<br />
<br />
But of course, +15% more damage/health will still not save you from insta-kill mechanics in a lot of the fights. People will still die horribly irregardless of the buff. They now just can't use the excuse of &quot;Well I can't DPS and move out of fire at the saem tiem. :(((((&quot;<br />
<br />
And I feel with this buff they won't do any more heavy-handed dungeon nerfs anymore.<br />
<br />
Again, a very simple, elegant solution. Good job, Greg.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Exactly. And then there are heroic raids. There are any number of ways to make the game MORE difficult. I'm reminded of palatanks soloing instances etc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A 12 year old player can still learn how to play properly, unless he's mentally challenged. Takes 5-10 min to read about your class and how to maximize it, and it takes about the same amount of time to read tactics on dungeons on Wowhead for instance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The &quot;casuals&quot; make up like 95% of the players. They pay 95% of the subscriptions. Should they not be allowed to play endgame?<br />
<br />
Like I've said time and again... if you're so hardcore, go heroic raid, or 3 man heroics etc.</div></div><hr />

I just don't see the need for this since it doesn't really take that long in the first place (queues yes, the dungeons themselves no).<br />

I'm going to say this and hope all of you morons are paying attention (although I doubt you'll read this).<br />
<br />
This change is done for bad and lazy players.<br />
<br />
Casual =/= bad or lazy.<br />
<br />
I play perhaps 1-2 hours a day and I spend the majority of that time doing daily quests and farming vanity pets. Yet somehow I never had trouble doing any of the heroic dungeons for the occasions I spend 3+ hours online. This change was done in regards for players who despite being shown time and time again that it would be ideal for them to team up with a guild on their schedule or other persons they know to do heroics, they decided to shove their hand into the Random LFG oven and get surprised when they get burned. And do this over and over again, because they are too lazy to actually find an online peer group to do things with. Or in some cases, they're just too terrible to figure out that after the 8th wipe that you need to get away from Rom'ogg Bonecrusher after breaking out of the chains. If you actually even break out of the chains.<br />
<br />
This change is an oven mitt. But note that oven mitts do nothing if you decide to shove your hand right into a casserole pan full of boiling potatoes and cheese.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For the record, my main has been raid ready since within a week of Cata launch since I ran lots of heroics in that time. However, it would be nice to have a little fun on my alts without wiping for hours in these heroics because people don't know what they're doing.

I know many posters here feel the heroics are easy enough as it is, but let's remember that Blizzard has hard data. I doubt they are doing this solely because members of the community are whining on the forums. I think they have actual data showing what groups are killing what bosses and when. They also have GMs who observe encounters - they monitor the world firsts. so having these people watch PUGs and take notes isn't far off the mark. There are milestones, where they want to see bosses being downed and loot being given out... if they're not reaching these, then the playerbase as a whole is struggling.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The optimum thing to do, if the rest of the system remains as now, as everyone gears up, is to have 3-4x guildies and bring in 1-2 randoms for the stacking 5% buff to zip through the trash. Then due to your majority still have the option just before a (end)boss to kick the randoms and you get your badges or a chance at the boss loot.<br />

Its not. It is when yourt geared and have great group comp. When you have little time and not enought guildies or what ever the case and less than desirable comp you are buffed. It always has beenn this way since they instituted it. Not one person in here rushed into a heroic with no cc and item lvl 329 gear for the whole group and roflstomp pwned heroics. Just stop. If you say you did prove it . <br />
<br />
Now buffing it 10% is debateable with patch changes coming. I like the idea, but at the same time its taking out a learning curve I feel is needed. I think that in general pugs have gotten worse instead of better becasue people are out gearing them and only run one per day for valor. Plus peopel feel everyone shoul dknow fights as well even though some are just getting to 85. This leads to little or no explanation and then when someone failsblah blah bad vorekick.<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
Because &quot;nerfing&quot; 5 mans is directly related to how the raids will be tuned?<br />
<br />
You're failing to see his point. Blizzard shoudn't put Zone wide buffs in places where they are not needed.<br />
<br />
If heroics are HONETSLY THIS HARD FOR PUGGERS. Stop, just stop. Rethink what the problem is. Are you a DPS Class? Is your spec correct for your role? Are you missing gems or enchants? Are you gemming or enchanting the wrong stat?<br />
<br />
There is NO LOGICAL excuse for this change other than. <br />

&quot;We enjoy watching the selecet handful of players with brains get upset when we drop 15%-30% passive buffs to Health, Healing and Damage. <br />

Intelligence is frowned upon on these forums, run while you can!<br />
<br />
I agree though, seems like each expansion is going to have one group whining, in BC everyone complained shit was too hard, got nerfed. WoTLK everyone complained things were too easy.. got buffed. Blizzard is just getting ahead of the curve now, or as it's really called &quot;balancing&quot;.<br />
<br />
One of the problems with everyone complaining is they forget that we were at the END of an expansion when everything became god awful easy(2 year old content is easy? no wai!). I see dungeons becoming super easy in a tier or two.<br />
<br />
Everyone take your medication, shit will be good eventually. (Both people who are SUPERANGRYRAWR that this buff went in and those that are like HEROIXRIMPOSSIBLEFIREWHAT?)<br />

<br />
Us Elitist pigs don't like it when you poorly playing swine get buffs in your pugs because you can not preform well enough in a 5 man.<br />
It upsets us greatly when we out play instances. and you get carried by Luck (of the draw).</div></div><hr />

Where is the increased reward for overcoming the higher difficulty?<br />
<br />
Having done a ridiculous amount of heroics since Cata launched I can't say I have noticed much difference in PUGs vs organised runs. To be honest the only difference is that in guild runs people don't rage quit after a wipe. I can also say that to a very large degree the better players are the ones who don't leave the heroic pugs. The amount of times it is the person who dies first on a wipe that leaves is funny. Is there anyone out there who ragequits at the first wipe (in either heroics or raids) who has ever attained any significant level of compotency at either?<br />
<br />
A 15% health buff is pretty huge though, most of the one-shot mechanics do about 120k damage, this puts them all pretty much survivable for anyone entering a PUG, drastically reducing the difficulty of an encounter.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It will help them to die 15% slower.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
For those who think Blizz is catering to all the bads, you are right, they are, more than 50% of the people who pay for this game each month are casual players, so they have to please the majority of players who help keep the lights on so the minority can go do Heroic Raids, content that less than 25% of the player base will get to see.<br />

Seriously, as long as you knew tactics, you could beat every HC boss without any problems. Changing the buff to 15% is just absurd.<br />

<br />
Like I've said time and again... if you're so hardcore, go heroic raid, or 3 man heroics etc.<br />
<br />
Why would I subject myself to 3 manning heroics when I get the same exact amount of Justice Points and the same loot drops? There's no incentive. I don't care if Casuals want to experience endgame. (Heads up, Heroic Dungeons aren't endgame btw.) If they really want to experience it, they can learn to play and stop being Wrath Babies. I've pugged quite a few heroic dungeons throughout Cata, and they're extremely easy with PuGs. But then again, if no one knows what they're doing, then it SHOULD be hard. The game shouldn't be nerfed because people are too damn lazy to figure out how to play. You can do Heroics, everone in all average iLvl 329 gear, and still succeed if you don't suck at the game.</div></div><hr />

Also, punishing people for playing with people they know and like to play with is great idea. 15% less for them, I say! Stupid socializers...<br />

<br />
All of you brats complaining about heroics becoming too easy should not even be posting. If you're so freakin' good that you can down a heroic in less than an hour already, you're obviously doing a heroic simply for your VALOR POINTS. let's recall WotLK.... over 80% of heroic daily groups in PUGS skipped at least 1 boss if possible if not more to end the heroic ASAP. <br />
<br />
So I ask you brats, why are you complaining again? How long has Cata been out? Why are you still FARMING HEROICS if you're so damn good that you can clear a heroic in an hour?<br />
<br />
Not only has Blizz given you options to take 0% - 15% increased dmg buff but they have not trivialized these heroic bosses.<br />
<br />
The vast majority of heroic pug's don't wipe because they don't have enough HP (not since the 2nd week of Cata release) or enough dmg but they wipe because of avoidable mechanics which will ONE SHOT you or nearly so. Healers who cast 2.4 cast speed heals during heavy dmg is not something a 15% buff will fix.<br />

I mean it's whatever though. I learned a long time ago to just do guild runs.<br />
<br />
I do have to agree with above poster though. How's this gonna stop the people who are too retarded to CC or people who break it all the time. How's it gonna fix the morons doing 4k DPS? Make them do 4.5k DPS? And the real question...how the hell is it going to stop the insta gib mechanics that retards love to get hit by?</div></div><hr />

Regardless of someones newness/noobness they should be able to complete an instance and leave raiding to those who can handle it.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bruin</div><div class="date">2011-02-04, 05:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the Luck of the Draw buff is a good change. When I run heroics with my friends/guild, yeah, its to get my daily VPs, but its also usually where we mess with the achievements and such. When I'm running with a PUG, I am just there for the points and don't really want to be there any longer than I need to be. Heroics shouldn't last 2 hours. Yeah, I'm sure some one will talk about how long the old dungeons were (Blackrock Depths comes to mind), but these current dungeons are no where CLOSE to the scale in size that those classic dungeons are, so why should a dungeon that is maybe at best 1/3 of the size take just as long? Quite simply, it shouldn't. <br />
<br />
Do players need to L2play? Of course they do. But have you recently leveled a new character to 85? Have you run those lower dungeons? At NO point anywhere before 85 does it require any actual skill/coordination to get through a dungeon. Oh sure, there's a &quot;difficult&quot; mechanic here or there, but nothing compares to the difficulty jump in the 85 heroics from anything prior - unless you're an experienced raider, at which point, you're probably running with your friends/guildies anyhow.<br />
<br />
So why is it a good thing that Blizzard &quot;nerfed&quot; heroics for &quot;casuals&quot;? Because they've built the game that way from the ground up. Raids are, and always have been, where the men are separated from the boys. And Blizzard gave us Heroic Raids in the last expansion. Seems like the challenge is there IF you want it. It shouldn't be forced upon you, ESPECIALLY when nothing in the game prepares you for it.<br />
<br />
Just my $.02</div></div><hr />

<br />
If heroics are HONETSLY THIS HARD FOR PUGGERS. Stop, just stop. Rethink what the problem is. Are you a DPS Class? Is your spec correct for your role? Are you missing gems or enchants? Are you gemming or enchanting the wrong stat?<br />
<br />
There is NO LOGICAL excuse for this change other than. <br />
<br />
&quot;We enjoy watching the selecet handful of players with brains get upset when we drop 15%-30% passive buffs to Health, Healing and Damage. <br />
<br />
Next thing you know you're going to be able to CC with luck of the Draw. It will mark pulls for you all through out the instance and ensure your healer doesn't go OOM.<br />
<br />
Now - you stop and think for a sec. Who added LFD tool into the game ? And for whom ? BLizzard added this feature but did NOT support it in any way shape or form with the new Cataclysm dungeons. THey ingored every person that pointed out he issues and they are STILL ignoring quite a few. This &quot;fix&quot; will not solve many of the issues that LFD tool has. THe true issue is that the Dungeons are not scalable to class - specs - or itemlevels. It still makes the dungeons horribily boring and repetitive over any lenght of time. Add 10 or 100% buff or nerf and its still the same crappy place with same dull mecanics after few months. <br />
<br />
So... wth do you care ? Run with your guildfriends. Oh... sorry .. didn't know it would destroy you game enjoyment that others can actually play too.</div></div><hr />

No, it won't. At all. The biggest failing point is people who get hit by Blitz, people who get tethered to the fire ele and just stand there, people who don't avoid the AoE's that will kill you...giving them 15% more damage won't save them from being stupid. At most it will make the competent ones 15% better, so you can just start 4 manning heroics and let the morons stay dead.<br />
<br />
And please for the love of god people...this is in no way a hardcore vs. casual debate. These are friggin 5 mans. There is nothing hardcore about them. Just because you are unfortunate enough to pug morons (or maybe are one yourself, /shrug) does not mean the rest of us are &quot;hardcores.&quot; It doesn't make you a &quot;casual&quot; because you struggle with 5 mans. My guild raids 2 hours a week and still has killed bosses. *That's* casual.</div></div><hr />

Oh yes because having to carry three dps pull under 3k and a healer who moves to stand in every fire and walks into explosions is TOTALLY what heroics are supposed to be like...<br />
<br />
Every time I tried to pug it would be the same thing. They don't know what CC is. Sometimes they'd pull under 1k dps (&quot;JUST /kick THEM &quot; unfortunately it doesn't work when three of them are from the same server). They stand in fire, and fml, that boss in grim batol. Possibly one of the easier bosses in all heroics, they'd die every single attempt, taking two...three..four firebombs to the face. No matter how far I got the boss from the fire bombs spawn before it came out. Despite whether or not I'd charge away and stun it before intercepting back. No matter how hard I pushed the perfect rotation I can not carry that many idiots. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The &quot;casuals&quot; make up like 95% of the players. They pay 95% of the subscriptions. Should they not be allowed to play endgame?<br />
<br />
No.. Casuals DO see endgame. They played hard modes and beat them eventually. They just do it after the hardcores because they don't play 7 hour raids 5 times a week to clear new content the moment it's released. Casuals do not need a buff.<br />
Casuals do make up 95% of the subs. Hardcores 3%. But the ones who get carried hardcore through everything, need that 30% buff to deal 5k dps a frost DK in AoE, and stand in fires are only 2% of the subs.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eace</div><div class="date">2011-02-04, 05:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So now, folks, we learned that making things hard and nerfing them right after by 15% is a great idea.<br />
<br />
Also, punishing people for playing with people they know and like to play with is great idea. 15% less for them, I say! Stupid socializers...<br />
<br />
Anyway, back to thoughtless grind of heroics... 15% faster thoughtless grind inc...<br />
<br />
Grinding easy stuff is fun!<br />
<br />
^ That was all sarcasm, in case someone didn't notice.<br />
<br />
I doubt that their intent was to punish playing with friends/guildies, but to encourage players to use the dungeon finder tool more to reduce the time in the queues.<br />
<br />
And honestly, I don't understand what difference does it make if heroics get &quot;nerfed&quot;. First of all, raids won't get nerfed (which are the main PvE content imo). And you already complain that they are too easy, so does it really matter if they make them even more easy? It's not that big a &quot;nerf&quot; (or a buff, whichever floats your boat) after all. Secondly, I personally tend to meet a lot of 5k dps people, so for me the &quot;nerf&quot; is more than welcome. In addition, there are already people that do the heroics for valor points only, so in the end this &quot;huge nerf to PvE&quot; is pretty meaningless.</div></div><hr />

With the upcoming nerf of most &quot;problematic&quot; bosses that will come in 4.0.6 heroics will be tuned down by quite a bit but I dont see that as a problem.<br />
<br />
Well played Blizzard, finally even people who play casually and/or arent 100% on top of the game (talents, rotation, tactics etc.) can somewhat enjoy pretty much the only PvE content that is actually designed for them.<br />
<br />
PS: I really dont like people who are smashing their cocks against the keyboard bitching about this. &quot;The big boys&quot; are supposed to be in the middle of downing heroic raid encounters now, not farming heroics.

Mmmm I doubt it. I'm sure that the 12 million casuals aren't all level 85, especially since they are casual... So that reduces the number significantly.

I've 4manned the last boss in grim batol... twice... once with a dps dying right away (1st fkin shadow gale) and the 2nd time with the healer dcing right on the pull (tank self-heals and some offhealing by the boomkin saved the day lol).<br />

That combined with luck of the draw should make it close to faceroll.<br />
if by MOST HEROICS you mean a SMALL HANDFUL then yes. Don't exaggerate changes that happened taken place yet. There is a PTR for a reason.<br />

Face Rolling would imply that you can live through aoe DMG without heals or pull multiple groups at once. <br />

Actually, I'm starting to think this whole ICC buff thing is going to ruin wow =| First ICC was made a joke, now heroics(but only if you pug.), who wants to bet 2-3 months from now we will be seeing a 20ish% buff in BwD and BoT? =|<br />

People that go in guild groups know eachother in a way and have much better co ordination. However 5 people that never met eachother might have trouble to work together, therefore blizzard helps them by making it easier for them. Stop qqing and try to think.</div></div><hr />

This is pretty damn silly. Heroics were fine. They were challenging for the first couple weeks of the expansion and then became virtually faceroll. Nerfing them further and further is just pointless. It does nothing but trivialize the content and make what's already a kinda boring run through a dungeon even more yawn worthy.

everyone keeps going on about how they only run everything in guild now<br />

i know most of my runs will only see a 5% increase at most<br />

This. A thousand times this. <br />

I checked out a couple of posters who posted &quot;MORE NERFS QQ, ridonkulous. Lust vanilla!&quot;, and the same people are the ones who were moaning about pugs being terrible. <br />
<br />
You pug a lot? Get annoyed with failed groups 'cos of co-ordination? This helps. <br />
You don't pug a lot? This doesn't effect you in any way shape or form. <br />
<br />
Ultimately they have made a slight change (not gonna be that big in most cases tbh) to getting blue gear.............(VP for epics later on, but that's another issue)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Aaaaanyways. It's really not that big of a deal, folks. I think it's a nice buff for puggers, but I promise you this isn't going to &quot;make things faceroll&quot; if you still have tanks pulling everything all at once. At least not while they're wearing 312 gear and have a bunch of pvp stuff in their bags.<br />

The thing is, this buff will help out all those pugging heroics thinking they are hard, this buff will however not eliminate certain encounters etc but only give you a slight Damage/healing/hp buff, and I repeat not a nerf to encounter mechanism.<br />
<br />

On both sides. There was a huge failure rate with pugs. People are complaining about long queue times. So they are trying something to see if it fixes it. Not everyone has 45-60 minutes to wait for a queue to pop and then spend another 1-2 hours for a pug to painfully work its way through a heroic. Yes, guild groups are the answer but sometimes you are only given the option to pug on a given night due to RL. <br />
<br />
I really don't see what the big deal is with people getting so worked up about this. Being in all heroic blues doesn't make you leet or amazingly impressive to anyone. If you want to QQ about this change, please feel free to link your armory profiles where you cleared heroic ICC before the buff hit 20% and where you have fully cleared heroic Tier 11 content. Oh right...you can't. Just because you want to thump your chest and sound big and macho, doesn't mean you should when you don't have the credentials to back it up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And honestly, I don't understand what difference does it make if heroics get &quot;nerfed&quot;. First of all, raids won't get nerfed (which are the main PvE content imo). And you already complain that they are too easy, so does it really matter if they make them even more easy? It's not that big a &quot;nerf&quot; (or a buff, whichever floats your boat) after all. Secondly, I personally tend to meet a lot of 5k dps people, so for me the &quot;nerf&quot; is more than welcome. In addition, there are already people that do the heroics for valor points only, so in the end this &quot;huge nerf to PvE&quot; is pretty meaningless.<br />
<br />
I didn't complain that raids are too easy. Stop saying that, and stop associating me with 'people&quot; who &quot;complain&quot;. They are different people with different opinions.<br />
<br />
I don't like the fact that at one point in development they decided to make the dungeons harder, and then decided to make it easy for pugs. It's against the idea of rewarding people for socializing and against the idea of harder heroics (which they supported early on cataclysm development)</div></div><hr />

Lol, why do you call me a Retard based on one post? =| Kinda rude. Anyways, not all guilds are tiny guilds where everyone knows each other in a way and have better co-ordination. Personally if a guild has 500 people in it I don't make it a point to go out and play and memorize all of their play styles. It's not hard in a pug to be like, CC this one and burn this one? Takes all of 2 seconds? 0% buff with guildies I sort of know, or 15% buff with random people who I can tell just as easily CC this one and burn this one. =P Even with people I do know I still shouldn't be punished to do the heroic on slow mode when if I did a random I could just AoE faceroll it.</div></div><hr />

IGNORANCE truly is bliss for you isn't it?<br />
A nerf would imply that the change is applicable to ALL SITUATIONS.<br />
IF you took more than a moment to read the original post you might have understood how this change is actually being implimented and that blizz has no intention of turning cata into Wrath.<br />
<br />
You're so adamant that these heroics are so easy already, so what, you're farming heroics this late into the Xpac instead of getting your gear in raids?<br />
That's right, you likely are not farming heroics unless of course you ARE a mouth breather. Then in that case why are you complaining about getting the loot you're hopefully focusing on getting in heroics, made a TAD more easy.<br />
Blizz should implement a 15% buff to your competence, but just like the change being made to the heroic Pugs, this buff will not solve your own stupidity.</div></div><hr />

Sure thing there boss... except I was the top DPS in every single one of those groups. I always either had a tank that was undergeared or didn't understand the concepts of the fight, or a healer that was incapable of keeping the tank alive. Yes, I did my part and didn't take damage except the stuff that can't be avoided, I don't stand in the fire or anything else that causes damage, and am an all-around good player. Who knows, I probably just got stuck with horrible groups every single time, that's certainly a possibility. <br />
<br />
Like has been said previously, it's only making heroics easier for a random group... just to make up for the fact that groups made up of all random players don't have any clue how to work together, not like a preset group.</div></div><hr />

Have to agree. I just couldn't care less about this buff. In no way does it offend me or violate some sense of entitlement I have. I picked up Cata Dungeon Hero on 12/11 when our group was still slightly below the minimum but had off-pieces in our bags to circumvent. They were challenging then but were not impossible. Once we learned the mechanics they were fine. This buff isn't here for those like us. This buff is for those less capable or less geared or whatever. That they will now be able to complete heroic dungeons doesn't bother me at all. I'm not sure why it would bother anyone that has already completed them.</div></div><hr />

A game that I don't have to put thought into is hardly a game. I admit I love the raids right now BECAUSE they are challenging. I actually have to think and react. WoW is actually a fun game if you are level 85, if you are in a raiding guild, and if you only ever raid =P.<br />

In ICC 30% buff meant you could stand in fire, death and decays and so on. 30% buff was the only reason why most guilds could get even close to as far as they got. So yes. 15% buff is a pretty big dealio =3</div></div><hr />

<br />
This buff should've been in the game since the release, it wasn't. That's called a bug.<br />
<br />
If you dislike how &quot;easy&quot; it may make Heroics then I suggest you quit using pick-up groups and join some guild runs instead. No ifs, no buts, no excuses. Guilds are there for a reason.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I swear man, every time a nerf/buff post appears about dungeons (DUNGEONS, of all things) there is a bum rush to be the first person to say:<br />
<br />
LISTEN JUST SO EVERYONE KNOWS MY GUILD DID EVERY HC IN 7 MINUTES, AOEd EVERYTHING, AND DID IT ALL IN VENDOR WHITES BABY!<br />
<br />
This. This times a thousand, million, billion burning suns. And stop with the slippery slope of &quot;raid buff from WotLK&quot; nonsense! Seriously! Jeeesh!</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">VanishO2</div><div class="date">2011-02-04, 06:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Because random 5 mans are serious business, right? People won't be able to get gear like we did in LK as easy, if at all. I don't see why this is a big deal.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Because &quot;nerfing&quot; 5 mans is directly related to how the raids will be tuned?<br />
<br />
In a larger scope, yes. You push ppl to the next level, but they don't have what it takes to move from there (because they were pushed to this level instead of learning how to get to it), they'll start QQ about the next one they will want to join now that heroics &quot;are easy&quot; for them.<br />
<br />
Not to mention it's a tremendous slap in the face of the &quot;it's a mmo, try to get along with others and organize your groups&quot;... what about &quot;try to teach the new players...&quot;? Everytime they buff ( nerf) stuff like this so players can bypass the multiplayer aspect of it and be a &quot;single player inside a group&quot;, the game moves toward &quot;Online Single Player Game&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Casuals don't play for that OMG WE KILLED A BOSS AFTER WIPING ON IT FOR 2 MONTHS feeling.<br />
<br />
We can't get that feeling if everything is so fucking easy you never wipe, and that is the direction it's going.<br />
<br />
I had so much fun when heroics first came out wiping over and over and finally beating a boss completely oom with the tank dead or w/e.<br />
<br />
Now it's become the same wrath grindfest. (Not saying heroics are hard, but I can clearly see where blizzard is going with this. There will be across the board nerfs to these current raids before 4.1)<br />
<br />
So wait you like the feeling of you sucking? than finally one day like you said after 2 months of wipes which kind of boggles my mind why you would want such a thing, it clicks in everyone's brain &quot;oh thats right stand over here and i wont die and can still dps&quot; that you downed a boss and feel accomplished? sounds to me that your group is kind of slow. I think your mindset should change to &quot; why am i so bad that i can only down a boss after 2 months of spending time on him....&quot;</div></div><hr />

Since cata was released, to date I have not even bothered queing for any pug heroics on my own at all (occasionally I get a group from my guild where we have 1 or 2 spots free but never just me queing on my own).. As a warlock the queues are ridiculously long, only to be grouped up with a bunch of people that will more than likely wipe repeatedly. That really isn't fun at all. I find myself either not playing at all or waiting until my guild mates are on later in the evening.<br />
What some of you guys need to realise is that there is a huge amount of diversity with regards to personal skill in this game. What is easy for me may not be easy for you and vice versa. <br />
If I do a heroic with people from my guild, all heroics are an absolute walkthrough, they have been since I hit 85 and got enough gear to enter them. That all changes if you have pugs in your group.<br />
<br />
Blizzard are bang on the money here, having a buff which scales dependant on how organised your group is to make everybody lives easier and more enjoyable.. Genius!</div></div><hr />

<br />
No it's not! It's really not! This is seriously making my blood pressure rise, ugh.<br />
<br />
There are still several bosses that have straight-up wipe mechanics if you're not doing your job properly. It will give you an edge on some of the medium-range bosses, and easy bosses will still remain straightforward. Even with a 30% buff I can't heal a tank through Ozruk's stuff, nor can I prevent someone from dying on Slabhide if they sit their arse in a fire bubble, or get a stalagtite on their head.<br />
<br />
Wrath in general had a lot less &quot;wipe mechanics&quot;. That PLUS the 30% buff is what got folks so far.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">theredviola</div><div class="date">2011-02-04, 06:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm on the fence about it... as one of those players who has a guild to run heroics with, I have more alts in normal dungeons than I do characters needing heroics; so for the normals it will help get through them. However, it will only perpetuate the idea that &quot;lol this isn't hard nemore&quot; when it comes to things such as much needed CC, or proper aggro control (I.E. waiting for the tank to establish threat, targeting the tanks target). <br />
<br />
So often when leveling up I have noticed a trend of a lot of players. &quot;You think this is my first toon? I no wat i'm doing. we don need cc, just ae and gogogogo.&quot; While, yes, in most cases things such as CC and aggro management in the lower level dungeons this is not an issue. But, when those players hit cata level dungeons, they were in for a rude awakening when they didn't target the tanks target, grabs aggro and instead of doing a pvp-style avoidance of the mob (no, not at jab at PvPers at all just giving you an idea) they get promptly 1 or 2 shotted. Same goes for CC, or pulling early. But now, with this buff, that will only perpetuate the idea that its okay to faceroll instances. I forsee a LOT more &quot;chill brah, this ain't heroic&quot; turning into &quot;chill brah, this ain't a 25man heroic raid...&quot;<br />
<br />
Why people don't take dungeons more seriously is beyond me. The normals and low levels is one thing; but to not take heroics seriously? Come'on! Insinuating that the only time you have to be &quot;srs face&quot; is in a raid is a false stigma and this buff won't help that.<br />
<br />
Which, on a side note, some 10 man raid bosses (on normal, I can not speak to heroic modes) are very forgiving when it comes to damage and mechanics. But, that's a debate for another thread I suppose.</div></div><hr />

then it's a good thing that heroics are NOT the whole game. do yourself a favor and stop trying to generalize the game based on ONE minor buff to one MINOR section of the game - that being Pick Up Group heroic instances.</div></div><hr />

How many hours a day during the week do I have to play? Over 12 if I choose so.<br />

Full time student is only a few hours a day of school and weekend work, 8 hours at max.<br />
<br />
Your point in no way is valid to someone who works full time.<br />
<br />
Okay well, my gf is in school for 8 hours a day usually, Fridays are shorter by a few hours, and on weekends she works 8 hours both days. So 7x8 is 56 hours a week spent at school or work, minus a few hours on fridays. Which means she probably has less time then you since you probably work 5x8 40 hours a week?

Imagine yourself in a room with four other people for a moment, in this room there is a bomb, ticking down slowly and a manual on how to disarm it. You start to read the manual... When all of the sudden one of the other four people starts speaking in a butchered dialect of your language and rams their face directly into the bomb. You all blow up, and when you wake up your in the same room staring at the same bomb once again. The same four idiots ram their head into the bomb. You leave the room only to find yourself in the same exact room with a different four idiots ramming their head into a different bomb. And you repeat this until god decides to make the bombs 15% harder to blow up with your face. <br />
<br />
Would you cry about this too?<br />
<br />
While a great analysis, nevermind it's the same kind of idiots and not the same 4 idiots exactly, you can just quit and do something else in reality (which you can't seem to in this situation).

<br />
This is pretty damn silly. Heroics were fine. They were challenging for the first couple weeks of the expansion and then became virtually faceroll. Nerfing them further and further is just pointless. It does nothing but trivialize the content and make what's already a kinda boring run through a dungeon even more yawn worthy. We're not that far away from Heroics becoming the roflstomp runs that WotLK had.<br />

<br />
&quot;...for three or more random players found through the Dungeon Finder is a necessary change.<br />
<br />
The intent of Luck of the Draw is to help make up for the lack of coordination, communication, and familiarity that pick up groups suffer relative to organized groups of guild members and friends.&quot;<br />
<br />
I really don't see the big deal here. If you run in a guild group, or with friends then you already have an advantage over PUGs because you have the coordination, communication, and familiarity that GC was talking about, and that is more of an advantage than a 15% buff. <br />
<br />
I think it is more a &quot;leveling&quot; the playing field than anything else. I have run heroics with friends, and I have run heroics in PUGs, and the difference is night and day. <br />
<br />
Not to mention that it is for three or more random people. People who don't know each other, and don't have the advantage that a premade group has.<br />
<br />
If you don't PUG, this will NOT affect you. If you do PUG, then this helps to offset the disadvantage of grouping with random strangers who may not be able to communicate or coordinate as efficiently as in a premade group. But this will never take the place of proper communication and coordination. <br />
<br />
I think it is a good idea.</div></div><hr />

Cata has been out how long now? and the 70 valor points you get from the daily heroic makes THAT much of a difference for you? if you're downing 11/12 normal raid bosses every week you're getting so many valor points that you're probably capped for the next raid tier.<br />

I'm just saying, if someone is having trouble killing the first boss of anything in a heroic it may not necessarily be their fault. I've seen some truly awful pugs that made me want to rip my hair out since the release of cata (when I was gearing up my guild had a set heroic group so they could craft everyones orb gear) and had to pug a lot... And I don't think my blood pressure had ever been higher. Every HoO group I had could never pass the first boss, in fact the first time I cleared it was when I got into a group that already downed him.</div></div><hr />

OT: Again fail to see the problem. You don't pug, it doesn't effect you. You do pug, it helps, but it's hardly game breaking.<br />

God, you of all the other little droolers, are the WORST of the sperm pool<br />
<br />
That is how you get to raid wide buffs and nerfs, smart guy.<br />
<br />
That's how everything started until we hit the lowest possible gameplay in WotLK. As soon as you start to back away from what you said (in this case, blizzard saying it should be like that and ppl should learn to play like they did in TBC because WotLK was wrong), you won't have any support anymore to get back to it. You cavein to their QQ, now they'll say &quot;see, we're right!&quot; and will start QQing about the next tier in dificult. How do you expect those players will react if the 4.1 heroics (or only heroic, I don't know) is way harder than today's heroics (as they should be, tunned for 346 to 359 geared players)???? They won't want it. How you think Blizzard can say anything about it to support their point of view on the &quot;the next stuff needs to be harder than the previous one&quot; since they alread said they were wrong?<br />
<br />
That's when we get to the raids. That's how we get to 30% ICC. There is no coming back after you gave it away. You see how hard it is to get away from the WotLK concept even after 2 months and many geared players/nerfed heroics.<br />
<br />
You give it, they learn only that QQ matters and they go for more. Blizzard was doing a fine job on trying to move ppl away from WotLK concept and &quot;QQ to earn gifts&quot;, but they just threw all their effort away. Sadly.</div></div><hr />

If you could actually read my whole post then you would realize that I mentioned more then just heroics... but uh... yeah?... go read my whole post before posting a post about my post? ._. It wasn't even that long of a post, like a whole 4 sentences. Also at endgame there are pretty much Raids/Pvp/Heroics/Collecting stuff to show off.

This is the best change they've done in a while. On a side note, some of the heroics are poorly designed in that the first boss is harder than the next 2 or 3. Halls of Origination comes to mind for one and Stonecore and Throne of the Tides as well. This is backwards, the difficulty should increase as you go further in, not get easier. The Lost City is the best designed in this regard in my opinion.<br />
<br />
My guild hasn't even started raiding yet because it's taken this long to get people appropriately geared. We also are having problems getting people to even log on and try. If this change would have been in effect from the beginning, we'd have been raiding a few weeks ago.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am pretty sure Blizz intended for the 30% buff to work the way it did, give a feeling of accomplishment to those guilds that can clear content without the buff, and then gradually make it easier so the majority of the player base can play deeper into the content.<br />
<br />
It seems to me that most of the people who want everything to be uber hard all the time know nothing about how a business model works. Go create your own really hard MMO and see if you can get 12 million people to pay you $12-15 per month to play it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And believe, they gave up on WotLK model because they had way more accounts frozen than now. Players won't leave a game only when it's hard. They leave when it's too easy. The easier, the faster you get burned out from the game. The faster you &quot;de-attach&quot; from the game and move to others or just feel you don't want to play it anymore.</div></div><hr />

Wonder why they tried to move away from that &quot;business model&quot;... looks like killing a raid one month later (and after each month with more % to the point of more than a year with 30% and nothing new) wasn't a success.<br />

I'm glad you're so confident that you're ahead of blizzard on changes that have not even been made. The amount of assumptions you're making about this Xpac is ridiculous at least.<br />

Blizzard is implementing a pending buff for 4.0.6 which will only effect one aspect of this game and even then it's OPTIONAL so stop acting like you're the Big Brother of WoW and making far-fetched statements about the future state of this Xpac</div></div><hr />

It is not only random people but also random selection of classes, which can majorly screw you if the dice was not on your side. I have been to fair share of LFD groups that had 0 effective CC. This will help random PUGs to be done a bit smoother while it will not change anything for guild or organized groups from trade chat. This is win-win solution for everybody.<br />

Im well past the time I need heroics, I dont even need valor points anymore (got my last peice last night) so I really dont care. Plus I always did them in guild runs anyways.

15% buff is not trivial as we saw in ICC. It will also not change it in a minor way, it's going to change how people run heroics. I'm not saying it's going to ruin my experience, if you actually read my posts instead of taking the smallest thing and then adding your own opinion and calling me a retard or such you might know this, I'm saying that it's stupid for me to feel punished for running with a guild group =P. Make the buff 15% all around or don't have it at all. Also yes this 15% buff is going to make things a lot easier which will take the fun out of the heroics which might ruin my experience with heroics. Which helps me not only gear my alts but also provides me with valor points on my main and also a bit of fun to do once and awhile.</div></div><hr />

If the 5% buff wasn't working in the first place, why the heck did they feel we need a 15% buff? Don't get me wrong, as someone who has to PUG, I like this strategy. But in my opinion, they should have just fixed the 5% and see how things went.</div></div><hr />

Also you're arguing with me that I'm freaking out about a buff so that doesn't seem like a good use of your time either...<br />
<br />
&quot;freaking out&quot; is your words not mine. Your ignorance for two sides of a coin is simply pathetic, for all the reasons which i've already given. Notice that I have reasoning for my statements instead of blindly making assumptions about changes that have not happened yet and do not necessarily mirror changes made in the past while from Xpac to Xpac WoW is evolving and progressing, not degressing, to say so makes you nothing but ignorant and that's not me slinging &quot;rude names&quot; at you that's me being logical.</div></div><hr />

this. if you have a solid group consisting friends/guildies, you will be safe anyway</div></div><hr />

It will also not change it in a minor way, it's going to change how people run heroics. I'm not saying it's going to ruin my experience, if you actually read my posts instead of taking the smallest thing and then adding your own opinion and calling me a retard or such you might know this, I'm saying that it's stupid for me to feel punished for running with a guild group =P. Make the buff 15% all around or don't have it at all. Also yes this 15% buff is going to make things a lot easier which will take the fun out of the heroics which might ruin my experience with heroics. Which helps me not only gear my alts but also provides me with valor points on my main and also a bit of fun to do once and awhile.<br />
<br />
It's just some silly heroic dungeons, get over it already, if you want challenge you know where to find it, and it's in raids.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No need for it since all heroics are perfectly doable as they are now, but who doesn't want a free 15% dps increase :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
12 pages of QQ! As I said...Who cares? If your so uber you'll be raiding and only doing heroics for gold/points NOT for the challenge<br />
<br />
Or to finish your Glory of the Hero? Or because not everyone burns the entire game on the 1st month? Guess one of the hardest achievements got 10% (or 15% as they want you to believe) easier (or 50%, 10% for each player).<br />
<br />
Because some ppl are bad and QQ a lot over the &quot;internetz&quot;, you're forced to burn the game faster and faster before they nerf the game down and you don't experience the game as they designed it.<br />
<br />
Wonder why ppl think that if a support forum is full of QQ, it would mean that the entire player base is QQ about that. Don't see why ppl would go to a forum (made to get support for problems) to post &quot;gratz for the game, nicely done&quot; tons and tons of time.<br />
<br />
It's like going to a company's support forum like ASUS and say &quot;omg, their product sucks hard, check it out, there is only ppl with problems here!&quot; because every single customer without problems needs to go there to post &quot;product XXXXX working as intended, thanks&quot;. Ok...<br />
<br />
I think that Cataclysm was better than WotLK, but never felt like I should go to their support forum to spam all the topics (or creating new ones) to let them know it so they don't think all their &quot;12 million players think it sucks&quot;.<br />
<br />
The excuse for increasing it saying that they need to increase it for cataclysm is so damn poor... as if my gear stayed like 264/277 instead of 346+... so that means the next xpac, we should expect something like an extra 15% over their current %? LOL</div></div><hr />
