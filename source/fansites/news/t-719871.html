Female Worgen hair styles<br />
They will have hair styles to choose from. The model is still a work in-progress and the pictures provided to our fan sites show her with no hair style. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/24915044495/female-worgen-pictures-released/))<br />
<br />
Larger health pools / AOE Damage in boss fights<br />
The first part is definitely a goal. The second part has been taken out of context a bit. I was saying that I was sure we would still have *some* fights with raid-wide AoE damage because that mechanic is one way to make healing feel different from encounter to encounter. But it is not a design to have persistent damage auras as part of every encounter. It's also not a design goal to have crowd control part of every encounter, but overall we expect you'll be doing more CC (and therefore less group tanking) than in Wrath. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/24915104517/cata-healing-environment-will-be-different/))<br />
<br />
Is Remote AH an ingame advantage?<br />
First off, no correlation can be made here between the idea of releasing a Remote Auction House feature and that of releasing epic equipment for sale. The ground is still quite firm on that slope.<br />
<br />
Second, a player who has more time in a week to play the game than you has an advantage over you by this same standard. Someone that has an hour or more a day to use the Auction House than you do has an advantage, and they're not even charged extra for it. The Remote Auction House provides no in-game functionality that isn't already available to every single player as often as they can or want to use it. The only difference now is that, for an additional monthly fee, players can use the Auction House in a remote fashion without having to log into the game client. <br />
<br />
I'm not sure how many time Blizzard has to say they won't sell gear before people will believe them. <br />
It's a legitimate concern. I'd share it if I weren't confident about our commitment to our players and our ultimate goal of creating epic games with incredible support and bonus features. Some players fear this happening so much though, that they almost wait for it to happen. With nearly any announcement we make about additional features or flavor items which have a cost associated, this is then seen as a sign of the slippery slope, no matter how large the leap to an adequate assertion may be.<br />
<br />
Our core philosophy has not changed and we feel we're being very reasonable about the products and premium services we're offering. They allow us to maintain a strong company, afford and maintain state-of-the-art tools and hardware, keep some of the most talented staff in the gaming industry around, and continue making great games. :) (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25002289996/is-remote-ah-an-ingame-advantage/))</div></div><hr />

Dear. Christ. Tungsten even thinks you are dense.tm<br />
<br />
The fact that they are straight up telling us it won't happen and talk about how they feel about their subscribers should be enough to stop comments like this one.<br />
<br />
Also...it is implied these things are created to generate more revenue, it's called business. However, the money that comes from these things ensures a better product as they can afford to continue development of the game as well as other products. And if they want to make some extra cash so they all get bonuses and raises? Good. I think anyone that can create a great product or service deserves it, especially if the increase in expense is optional to all users. Unlike, for example...Canadian telecom.</div></div><hr />

There will be an advantage where users can and have time to access internet in a situation where they can't play the game, such as at work or school. Ones at disadvantage are the people who will refuse to pay the fee to have that option and/or don't have access to internet at work. I hope Blizzard will restrict abuse of this service through scripting.<br />
<br />
Personally I don't like remote AH because I refuse to spend anymore RL time with it. So I will be at a disadvantage because there will be a lot more access to the AH.<br />
<br />
Blizzard is really spinning this. Since this service isn't free... so how close is this to paying real money for in game gold?</div></div><hr />

so flooding your whole screen with fire makes a fight &quot;epic&quot; ?<br />
it's just my personal opinion, almost every encounter in vanilla and bc seemed somewhat new and exciting.<br />
i wouldn't say that the last 2 years of wow-pve were garbage (ulduar and icc had really fun and well designed/balanced encounters) but re-using multiple boss mechanics (wont go into details with the dragon models here... gawd) is far from awesome imho.<br />

<br />
I did nothing in ICC so I apologize for my ignorance, but most fights in Ulduar were DPS races. Unless you had a bad guild or something, most Ulduar fights were hardly exciting (with the exception of Mimiron since all the phases reminded me of old-school Vanilla bosses). The hardmodes were usually just clusterfucks (Freya) or consumable stacking (pretty much every other hardmode) i.e. DPS races on steroids.</div></div><hr />

As a matter of fact, being a paying customer entitles you more so to voice your displeasure.<br />
And that's fine.<br />
<br />
Being a paying customer myself, I am also free to call bull on anyone that decides to make a complete negative out of something. <br />
<br />
To me, an opinion about a viewed fight is thrown completely out the window if they cannot find one thing about the fight they like (honestly, even saying that the fight will only be cleared by people that have raided ICC is at least a positive in some respects), they actually say it's easy when they haven't even seen it live yet to give their own perspective on it (and let's not talk about hard modes, which I've seen people claim &quot;oh, that's easy, too&quot;.), and they decide to use the fight as an example that the last two years have been, as you put it, garbage.<br />
<br />
People tend to always push up the negative and never any positives. It's a fairly bad habit to have. If the fight is truly easy for you on normal, there'll be hard mode to worry about, and if it's going to have loot close to Lich King heroic, I'm sure it'll have to be fairly difficult.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Garbage&quot; is a very VERY subjective term. Some of us thoroughly enjoy the game. Some of us enjoy not having to be in a hardcore raiding guild to do things. Sure there have been some additions/changes that have either been lackluster or irritating, but the amount of good that has come out far outweighs the bad.<br />
<br />
But hey, I suppose whining is fun.</div></div><hr />

it's just my personal opinion, almost every encounter in vanilla and bc seemed somewhat new and exciting.<br />
i wouldn't say that the last 2 years of wow-pve were garbage (ulduar and icc had really fun and well designed/balanced encounters) but re-using multiple boss mechanics (wont go into details with the dragon models here... gawd) is far from awesome imho.<br />
<br />
and no, i'm not really surprised, just hoped they'd do better<br />
<br />
<br />
It's also filler content. It's not really meant to be new and exciting. I like the look of it, personally, but that's just me. I mean, there's nothing wrong with taking previously used mechanics and meshing them all together to make something that seems unique for filler content. And, by the by, the fire-spreading is more akin to Morrowgar in the sense that it stems out on its own rather than player-controlled (or fear-induced) fire-spreading.<br />
<br />
Either way, have you counted just how many bosses (Raid, Dungeon, World) there are in WoW at this point? Unless Blizzard picks up some new technology for gameplay, there's going to be some things that are recycled from older content. Especially if you are someone that has done it all before. There's only so many options you have for uniqueness with 500+ boss mechanics currently in the game.</div></div><hr />

Not even bosses can be unique when realism is thrown into play. Plenty of dragons can spew fire. <br />
<br />
Plus, you can't really be surprised since this is a 'filler' instance. I doub't they'd give it as much effort as they would ICC. <br />
<br />
Also, another note. Boss are bound to have very similar mechanics in the long run. Nothing is unique forever. As long as blizzard tries to make it look differant and doesn't make the entirety of the fight the exact same as another boss, I'd be cool with it<br />
<br />

The fact they address it as a legitimate concern is an arrow towards it.<br />

How long did they say they wouldn't allow you to change faction? Race? How about that leveling from 1 is needed to get the gameplay of a new class(dks)? How about the original mission statement that everything will cost the same amount per month for everyone?<br />

Also, when WoW was originally launched with the $15/month model, they didn't expect to get even 1 million subscribers. They peaked at over 11 million.

Blizzard, like any company, is in a position where they could afford to give away free stuff. However, in business all that matters is the bottom line. They are currently in a position where they are respecting their customers while turning massive profit. There is nothing wrong with this. Anyone (ANYONE) in the same position would do the same thing, so please...enough of the trying to chastise the company for doing what business does. Instead, think of it as possibly the best game development company in the world gaining more ground to continue to pump out high quality products for years to come (Diablo, Starcraft, and whatever their next MMO is supposed to be).</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't know about using Faction change over Race Change/Re-customization... but obviously some will be used more than others.<br />
<br />
I'm not trying to argue that all these things should be given away for free to everyone. That being said, there are different ways of doing things to make it less money-grabbish. $15 to change maybe 6 values in a database? $25 to change 1? They could easily lower the cost of the services... or offer 1 free transfer per paid year... or make it available in-game. I understand that they want the services to not be over-used, but that's what the (now removed) cooldowns were for. They've shown that if you have the money, they'll make the exception.</div></div><hr />

Fear based on a logical fallacy. That is why people are annoyed, especially when it is brought up in like every single GD topic. <br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
I don't know how to really explain it any other way, so I'll just be blunt about it. There isn't a single successful company in the WORLD who ever stops and thinks: &quot;Oh, we make enough money. Let's just stop making money.&quot; They haven't done a single thing anyone else wouldn't do given the situation, and most importantly, they aren't doing anything wrong.

I don't know how to really explain it any other way, so I'll just be blunt about it. There isn't a single successful company in the WORLD who ever stops and thinks: &quot;Oh, we make enough money. Let's just stop making money.&quot; They haven't done a single thing anyone else wouldn't do given the situation, and most importantly, they aren't doing anything wrong. I don't even want to defend a company who doesn't know me or care who I am but the hyperbole and whining is absolutely stupid. <br />

I never said they should stop turning a profit. That's what companies do (ideally). There are an infinite number of examples of money going to someone's head, though. Once you get a &quot;taste,&quot; it can be hard to not keep going back for more. Bobby Kotick (Activision) is notorious for squeezing all the money he can out of existing franchises. That, coupled with Blizzard reneging on previously rejected ideas (PvE -&gt; PvP transfers, item shop, et al), are probably the biggest reasons that people have reservations about the future.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, that is much better, thank you. However, I think that several of these options became available because people wanted them. I must prefer these types of services require money simply because it limits the amount of people who want to do them without raising a new character. The exact kind of rampant faction switching and server hopping people worry about is kept in check by people needing not only to pay but imposing achievement limits and transfer timers. These services aren't just half-assed, they are well implemented and people want them. <br />
<br />
As for the aesthetic things, who has the right to care about people spending their money on crap? There is plently of RL crap people spend their money on everyday, this is not new, and it absolutely does not impact the game. There is absolutely no precedence for Blizzard making anything in their MMOs that a person has been able to pay for that impacts the game. None. <br />
<br />
Basically I see: <br />
Blizzard: &quot;We aren't going to sell things in the store that impact game balance.&quot;<br />
<br />
Random people&quot; &quot;Omg, you are lying! And for proof I need only remind you of all these things you are selling that don't impact game balance! There's a connection!&quot;<br />
<br />
???<br />

Do you want Blizzard to be swallowed like the rest of Vivendi Games (Activision)? Do you want them to continue to release huge content packs for FREE? How many other games would release: ZG, AQ20/40, Naxx40, ZA, Sunwell, ToC, RubySanctum for free?

<br />
<br />
You say this as if strikes, boycotts, complaints, and policy changes have never been part of the capitalist economic system. Lol.<br />
<br />
It's sad to see Blizzard stoop down to this level. The AH app can clearly provide an advantage. Maybe an infinitesimally small and negligible one, but it's still there. The slippery slope fallacy is a fallacy that abuses the slippery slope's inductive properties, assuming that A leading to B, leading to C, leading to... Z implies A leading to Z, i.e. without any gradation or middle ground. No one (except for the person saying that the iPhone app &quot;leads&quot; to selling of gear) is acting on this fallacy. As a matter of fact, most people are pretty careful in acknowledging the presence of middle ground. We may not see the selling of gear any time soon, but there might be other purchasable services that are likely to push the envelope even further. This is hardly a fallacy, and it's very logical.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, it's to be expected, given their current stance on the respect they have for their customers given by the current Vernor v Autodesk, UMG v Augusto, MDY v Blizzard-Activision joint-lawsuit going on (which, if it goes in Blizzard/Autodesk/UMG's side could be a very dangerous precedent).<br />
<br />
I haven't played for more than a year now, but the game has significantly dropped in quality since AQ40. From recycled armor to rehashed boss fights, to empty promises, the facts speak for themselves. Unfortunately, there's just nothing else out there. So essentially, WoW has a huge monopoly over the MMO market just because it is an AAA+ title and AoC, WAR, L2 can't compete. Depending on what happens with the new Final Fantasy and Star Wars MMOs (and other, unannounced, MMOs), a foreseeable a shift in the market is inevitable.<br />
<br />
My two cents is, go out, go to a park, read a book, get a girlfriend or boyfriend! Enjoy life :)</div></div><hr />

And the upkeep for servers hasn't gotten more expensive in the last 5 years outside a couple of percentage points, they haven't built new server farms(may have replaced some of the really bad ones) as high pop servers are horrible to play on 2-3 days a week go have fun tues wed or thurs evening on blackrock us for instance.

Whoever made the vid is probably rightfully proud of a job well done. What they're not asking you to do is be proud of them. They also aren't asking you to watch the video. Check with your doctor about your 'roid dosage.</div></div><hr />

You're an idiot. The people clearing this fight are 11/12+ heroic ICC25. They're the same tools that come in every PTR and say everything is too easy because they think content is developed for that small portion of the player base that has their gear and coordination as a raid. It's not even heroic mode, it's a normal mode encounter designed to be on par with ICC-level bosses, most of which are puggable. Gee, an ICC25 heroic geared/experienced group walks into a normal mode boss fight and makes it look easy? I guess that means it'll be the same for everyone else AMIRITE?!<br />
<br />
I've raided all the content since vanilla and think it looks like an epic and fun fight. Maybe it's time you quit being butthurt because more than 1% of the player base actually get to see content now and people don't care to inspect you when you stand in Orgrimmar because more than two guilds per server have end game gear now.</div></div><hr />

Is Remote AH an ingame advantage?<br />
First off, no correlation can be made here between the idea of releasing a Remote Auction House feature and that of releasing epic equipment for sale. The ground is still quite firm on that slope.<br />
<br />
Second, a player who has more time in a week to play the game than you has an advantage over you by this same standard. Someone that has an hour or more a day to use the Auction House than you do has an advantage, and they're not even charged extra for it. The Remote Auction House provides no in-game functionality that isn't already available to every single player as often as they can or want to use it. The only difference now is that, for an additional monthly fee, players can use the Auction House in a remote fashion without having to log into the game client. <br />
<br />
<br />
I'm not sure how they can come to this conclusion. There's an obvious wink and a nod here where the player willing to pay the service gets the advantage ingame while the guy without losses money. Surely the advantage is monetary (in game) but it's still a paid service for in in game advantage, that's skirting a very fine line. The winner in the end is still the guy paying the money so he can manage his auctions at his desk job/school while those that don't lose.<br />
<br />
People will try to claim that this doesn't effect gameplay at all and that it offers no advantage in a raid or pvp but those are the idiots that still do dailies for money. Not to mention there already is a feature which allows you to increase your raid/pvp performance for a fee (re-race).</div></div><hr />

It's to test if any of the mechanics are broken. Anyone remember Saurfang ignoring expertise and dodging like crazy? Once they're sure a fight isn't broken, they can easily tweak damage before it goes live.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
As I said.. i have no disagreement that they have musical talent.. but musical talent does not automatically make good music. The funny thing is I'm not even a big techno fan, I just think it's hilarious that people like you say &quot;Your opinion of music is stupid, my opinion of music is the only way&quot;... it's opinion. Just because you don't like it, doesn't mean it's bad. If I think Between the Buried and Me is bad, does it mean they are bad?? No.. it means I, personally, think they suck. Even the song you linked sounds like a cheap version of Dream Theater, which is also a band loaded with insane talent</div></div><hr />

<br />
The reason why they come out now explaning it (AGAIN), is because so many people is so terrible concerned about it. I don't know how many times they have to say it, but they WONT sell Gear for actual money.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm still amazed people think blizzard &quot;won't&quot;<br />
<br />
Guess people really don't know them all that well.<br />
<br />
BTW they most likely already have it planned out, its just a matter if certain parameters are met for them to go live with it or not.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
And if they'd fix all those bugs in the game first everyone would whine about no content being released for a while, cause you know, that takes time and testing aswell. Those bugs aren't high on prio-list.<br />

Unless you had a bad guild or something, most Ulduar fights were hardly exciting (with the exception of Mimiron since all the phases reminded me of old-school Vanilla bosses). The hardmodes were usually just clusterfucks (Freya) or consumable stacking (pretty much every other hardmode) i.e. DPS races on steroids.<br />

None of which boring DPS races, all of which require a lot of control and coordination from the raid. Ulduar is the best raid of this expansion.<br />

<br />
Anyway, onto my real question.<br />
<br />
What is the ilvl of gear that Halion drops (for each mode)?<br />
<br />
<br />
those scripts won't be very profitable seeing as there's going to be a comparatively small number(200ish) of postings allowed per day via remote AH, serious AH players make over a thousand a day.</div></div><hr />

Not entirely true.<br />
<br />
It was more healer mana management than DPS, but obviously DPS took a huge role.</div></div><hr />

<br />
lawl, you played a melee DPS that just had to stand there and AFKautoattack, didn't you?<br />
<br />
Mana and interrupt management made that fight fun. Let him get one or two spells off and it's almost a guaranteed wipe.</div></div><hr />

Ew. That content will be cleared immediately. I thought it may last a few weeks, I was wrong after talking to people testing it after seeing this. So what? They massively boost the damage that no one except hard-mode ICC geared can do? It won't be like that at all. It'll be geared around 251 gear at best in 10man, 264 for 25man, and that's probably generous.<br />
<br />
That AH add-on premium service is a bad sign of what's to come to this game. It's a pay-for-advantage, something that should never-ever exist in a game like this. Not so much me, but I can understand why some people who play the AH-game are upset over this, along with others worried about prices rising or harder to score gear. It's an advantage Blizzard, don't try to play it down.</div></div><hr />

Ok. One word. Cronjob (http://www.thesitewizard.com/general/set-cron-job.shtml). Someone, somewhere, will rip Auctioneer apart, port it into PHP, and have a database of every AH on every faction on every server, EU and US, refreshing every 5 minutes. And then they will charge people to look at it. And THEN they will charge people to have their site automatically log into their online AH page and buy out or bid anything it finds in a selected rule (ie: Buy all Primordial Saronite for &lt;700g and immediately relist it for 800g, or buy all Icethorn for &lt;15g/stack and mail it to my alchemist so I can craft it and list it later)<br />
<br />
Is THAT an unfair advantage? Yes it fucking is.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arkaena</div><div class="date">2010-05-21, 08:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There's no -20% dodge nerf, zone-wide buff here so I'm curious to see thoughts on that. How's tank damage in this fight compared to something in icc? <br />
<br />
As for remote AH, it's just like carrying around a laptop with you and logging in to work some stuff on the AH. In my opinion though, you should have to log in to actually play the game. The AH is still playing the game even if you're not on your character fighting dragons etc. Some people play the game for achievements, some play it to make money, technically, those who play the game for achievements have an easier time if they can change factions, buy vanity pets/mounts etc. I myself would say the game is designed for questing and running dungeons/raids and I suppose pvp. If it doesn't help you with one of those things, it's not an advantage. What are you really going to do with all this gold anyways? What else is there to do?<br />
<br />
I like the video overall. Some of my gripes are all the time it takes to go through the titles, exploding and reforming...it takes a long time and it's just the same thing with different words. Something shorter would be better in my opinion. As for the music, it's not what I would pick, I don't mind the rhythms and such, but I don't like how prominent the vocals are. It's like it's trying to describe what's going on in the fight and failing. It's distracting. The countdown in the music is especially distracting as you're waiting for it to reach zero or to hear what it's going to do next instead of watching the video. The fight looks entertaining. I don't believe it's meant to be a send-off, just a sort of a transition into cataclysm while something else comes up in the world that we need to take care of. <br />
<br />
Look at this as less of a business making a game and more of a storyline and it'll be more fun. Just have fun, socialize with people in game, and look back at your whining and complaining. Be entertained. If you're not entertained, find something else to do but please stop being a downer.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">loftus</div><div class="date">2010-05-21, 09:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I personally dont mind too much about the race change, name change and character changing (like sex change) because they are available to everyone. All those services are doing is providing people that are bored or really dont like their character a way or changing it for personal piece of mind. That i have no problem with.<br />
<br />
I do find it a problem though when there are either things in the game that are impossible for me to get unless i spend extra money, or things in the game that can be done without actually playing the game. E.g. pet/mount sales and the new AH system.<br />
<br />
The same goes for all the recruit a friend crap. Seeing people go from 1-60 in a couple of days of casual playing + a new mount as well is just silly.<br />
<br />
I think people who say 'dont like it? dont play!' are sort of missing the point too. The reason people post complaining about things is because they enjoy the game, but dont like that particular feature. I enjoy the game and think cata is looking great so far, but the paid services(mentioned ones), recruit a friend (and while we are on it) heirloom items are features that i dont like and think should either be changed or removed from the game.<br />
<br />
Im not saying blizz will definately come out and sell epics for gold, but i do think that selling anything to person A that person B cant get without paying isnt cool. I would rather Person A gets a pet that i dont because they are a much better player, rather than they just throw money at the game.<br />
<br />
As far as the screenshot goes it looks like westfall is still reasonably intact, apart from the swirling vortex in the background of course lol. Hope they dont change it too much, it's my favourite area in the game atm :)</div></div><hr />

comes a time in MMOs when pretty much every possible option has been exhausted with the given mechanics of the engine.. if you look at basically every fight in ICC, they are all rehashes (for the most part) of other bosses you've seen in WoW. this is mostly why people jump ship after a period of time, because it's always same old stuff even if it's &quot;new&quot; stuff.<br />
<br />
would be interesting if a company would try to innovate the market some and instead of constantly updating a tired engine, just make a brand new engine for the same game.</div></div><hr />

I wouldn't say never though. The current team developing WoW will probably never release said gear for cash, but the game could very well outlive some of these key employees or they get assigned to new games that are against going this route but the new blood that comes in taking their places jumps all over it. The point is everything changes for better or worse it's what we all must learn to accept. <br />
<br />
I will say this though the constant living in fear and always jumping to the chicken little worse case scenario is highly ridiculous, in my opinion that's no way to live ones life. People should enjoy the things they have now while they still have it instead of always fearing the future.</div></div><hr />
