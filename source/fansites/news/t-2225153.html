Hi everyone! There’s a few things to call out for this PTR update:<br />
<br />
First, we’re continuing iteration on 7.2.5 class changes, and this build has some pretty substantial changes for a couple of specs. Arms Warriors in particular have a lot of updates and revisions, and both Marksmanship and Beast Mastery Hunters have several changes to their Honor Talents.<br />
<br />
We’re also continuing to iterate on Tier 20 set bonuses, and have added several new Legendary items in this build. Once the PTR is up (or shortly thereafter), you should be able to find the new Legendaries on Flaskataur in Dalaran if you’d like to give them a try.<br />
<br />
We’ve turned on the Darkmoon Faire for this week as there’s a new band in town! The concert event starts every hour on the half hour. We’d like to get some testing and feedback, so please let us know what you think!<br />
<br />
This build also has a tweak to Mythic Keystone difficulty. Specifically, the amount of health and damage that enemy creatures get from each additional difficulty level is increasing from 8% health and damage to 10% per keystone level. When we increased the overall difficulty of Mythic+ dungeons in 7.2, we didn't fully account for the increase in power that players would get from their new Artifact Traits. That hasn't been a major problem just yet, but once the Tomb of Sargeras raid opens and the maximum item level from drops increases, everyone’s going to get a LOT stronger in a hurry, which will quickly compound the issue. We're making this change to ensure that things don’t get too out of hand at the top end of the spectrum.<br />
<br />
Lastly, we’d like to do another Skirmish with the Blues this week to gather some data on where PvP balance currently sits on the PTR to assist with PvP tuning. We’re scheduling this for Friday, May 26 from 2 PM to 4 PM Pacific time (5 PM to 7 PM Eastern). Any data we can get at this stage will be extremely helpful, so we hope you’ll join us.<br />
<br />
Thanks again everyone, and happy testing!<br />
<br />
<br />
Raid Testing Schedule - May 25-26<br />
On Thursday and Friday, May 25-26, we will be conducting Mythic raid testing of Tomb of Sargeras bosses.<br />

As always, this testing schedule is very fluid and subject to the realities of a PTR environment. We might have to change the time of a testing session, change the bosses being tested, or cancel a test entirely, due to bugs, server hardware issues, etc. Keep an eye on this forum for the latest information, and thank you in advance for testing and providing feedback.<br />

For Veng, another charge on empower wards is pretty good... if going up against a magic heavy boss. I could see it allowing the razor spikes build to be a bit better, but these charges don't really do the same thing as increasing the damage of rotational abilities.<br />

<br />
The majority of the damage dealt by guardian isn't nature/arcane damage, so it won't really be a 30% boost or 30% of their DPS as healing. For the most part it will only effect Moonfire, brambles if they're talented into it, etc. It's not as big as you're reading it to be.</div></div><hr />

....Damnit blizzard. YOU KNOW THIS STILL DOESNT COME CLOSE TO SAVAGE ROAR. Trading Savage Roar for Soul of the Forest means you're losing a +25% damage bonus on your Rakes, Shreds, Swipes/Brutal Slash, Thrashes and Auto-Attacks just to buff Rip by 50% and starve yourself with expensive and mediocre FB's until the cows come home. This talent seems like it's been changed to help players use it as a stepping stone towards learning feral, or to be used as a weakier passive alternative for players struggling to keep Savage Roar's uptime at 100%.<br />
<br />
This talent could be pretty sick If we had a legendary that heavily buffed Ferocious Bites damage, but it's just not viable if you want to excel at your class.</div></div><hr />

You wouldn't be able to compete with that proc but that's a scenario against someone with a maxed artifact which is unrealistic. It would be better to question if you could compete with someone whose proc was +1k or +2k more than yours.</div></div><hr />

I never really leave burn phase and use arcane barrage. Could a more experienced Arcane mage say whether or not this is actually good?<br />
<br />
<br />
Raid perspective:<br />
<br />
Compared to the fire/frost ones, it's pretty awful. You cast FAR fewer barrages than you ever will firebolts/pyros or frostbolts/flurries, it's a chance to proc what is essentially a utility, not a damage spell, and so no telling if happens when you want to rely on it or not, and said spell is just not a straightforward damage nuke like comet/meteor are.<br />
<br />
How does it compare to other Arcane ones though, is really the bigger question? That's tougher - arcane legendaries are weak around the board. I'm just not sure how you could ever work this into your rotation though; one of the benefits of having Arcane Orb is being able to barrage during your burn phase without losing stacks, as long as you can hit 3+ targets. But a reliable Orb versus a CHANCE to proc one isn't the same thing, what if you barrage during burn phase and don't get the orb? What if you're moving and Barraging as you move so get the Orb in the wrong direction and it doesn't hit anything? So you probably won't barrage during burn (60% proc chance on 4 charges still equates to messing up your burn phase 40% of the time after all), so you probably won't EVER get this to proc during Arcane Power or prepot times when you're burning and it would have the best effect, and it will probably have at least a few complete fails on those times you time barrage to movement to avoid losing DPS during conserve phases.<br />
<br />
It also basically locks you into Resonance... but that's probably the strongest talent on that tier anyway for PvE content.<br />
<br />
It's basically not good, but its competition isn't that great in the spec either. In some ways that's a good thing for Arcane; with no utterly enormous must-have power boosters in the legendaries, there's not nearly as far a gap between having a good set and having a bad set. There's still the top tier and the low tier, just a smaller gap. I don't think I'd take this over the kilt, time warp ring, or belt to a raid. I might try it with the kilt in dungeons though.<br />
<br />
Edit: I think after some thought, how I'd use it is when I'm already taking Orb. When Orb is off cooldown, barrage, if this procs, blast/missilesx2 then barrage again, until it fails to proc then use your actual orb and play normally until Orb comes off cooldown again. I can see why it's not 100%; otherwise it'd be silly with the kilt, you could do barrage/blast|missilesx2/barrage all day and never lose mana. But with it not at 100%, the risk of being stuck at 0 stacks during burn is too high to take without a backup plan, and if you're barraging this much you want Resonance so Charged Up isn't an option - so Orb talent it is. That sounds like it might be better cleave than I'm giving credit for initially at least, though.</div></div><hr />

To be fair, getting legendaries is the ultimate RNG. I have an alt, it doesn't even have 24 hours /played on lvl 110 and already got 2 legendaries on it (well 3, but one is the craftable one). While I don't remember my main's &quot;/played on this level&quot; upon getting it's first legendary, it was in early November, so I'm pretty sure it had waaaaaay more than 24 hours in it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Stacking POINT on concordance after 52 is pretty &quot;useless&quot; since you can wait 1 month get better AK and get the same point in 2 days of farming instead of going full retard for 2 weeks now.<br />
Best practise is to get 52 and then go with OS or ALT and you will get all the point you need without crying too much<br />
<br />
Also dont mind yourself why people are so dense and retard, we are on MMO C people are stupid af here, just look the bonobos whiny for the new legendary &quot;HURR DURR WHY SOMEBODY WOULD CHOOSE THEM OVER THE BIS???&quot; because maybe not everybody have the bis and even something different from &quot;prydaz&quot; can be better for them, too hard to understand for some minus habens.<br />
<br />
<br />
edit : also about the new legendaries, we still need info that they are in the &quot;RNG&quot; pool or are something probably linked to the class hall quest like the ring [inb4 people moaning about class hall quest that &quot;nobody want to do&quot; but they MUST for the legendary bla bla bla kys garbage&quot;]</div></div><hr />

Playing with LoV doesn't change the fact that it's pure garbage. <br />
&quot;Well dont use it then&quot; isnt exactly an excuse for making a garbage legendary. Other specs/classes receive good leggys that are either straight up better than current ones or allow for more variation and adaptation depending on the fight, shadow gets something that is at BEST a dungeon meme, and even then ring/ring/bracer is probably better. <br />
<br />
The design of this legendary goes against the very core design of shadow, which is, to be quite frank, just straight up retarded.<br />
Just the fact that you'd need to dot everything up first THEN pop VoiEr for any kind of value from it is mindblowing.</div></div><hr />
