World of Warcraft Reaches 12 Million Players!<br />
&quot;Rumors of my demise have been greatly exaggerated.&quot;<br />
IRVINE, Calif. -- October 7, 2010 Blizzard Entertainment, Inc. announced today that the subscriber base for World of Warcraft®, its award-winning massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG), now exceeds 12 million players worldwide. This milestone was reached in the wake of the mainland Chinese launch of World of Warcraft's second expansion, Wrath of the Lich King®, and also as global anticipation continues to mount for the December 7 release of the game's third expansion, Cataclysm™.<br />
<br />
&quot;The support and enthusiasm that gamers across the world continue to show for World of Warcraft reaffirms our belief that it offers one of the best entertainment values available today,&quot; said Mike Morhaime, CEO and cofounder of Blizzard Entertainment. &quot;We are as committed as ever to taking the game to new heights, and we look forward to demonstrating that with Cataclysm in December.&quot;<br />
<br />
Since debuting in North America, Australia, and New Zealand on November 23, 2004, World of Warcraft has become the most popular subscription-based MMORPG around the world. It was the bestselling PC game of 2005 and 2006 worldwide, and finished behind only World of Warcraft: The Burning Crusade®, the first expansion pack for the game, in 2007. For 2008, the World of Warcraft series represented three of the top five bestselling PC games, with Wrath of the Lich King finishing the year at #1, and in 2009, World of Warcraft titles claimed three of the top six spots.*<br />
<br />
World of Warcraft is currently available in eight languages and is played in North America, Europe, mainland China, Korea, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines, Chile, Argentina, and the regions of Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macau.<br />
<br />
To keep pace with the continued growth of World of Warcraft as well as development on other Blizzard Entertainment games, the company is currently hiring for numerous open positions. More information on career opportunities available at Blizzard Entertainment can be found at www.blizzard.com/jobs.<br />
<br />

Battle.net Authenticator Change<br />
To help keep Battle.net accounts as secure as possible, we’ve recently changed how Battle.net authenticators can be used. Going forward, Battle.net authenticators can now only be associated with one Battle.net account at a time. No changes are being made to how many game licenses a single Battle.net account can support. You can still have multiple World of Warcraft accounts under a single Battle.net account, for instance, and all game licenses linked with a Battle.net account will still be protected if an authenticator is in use.<br />
<br />
Those of you who currently have more than one Battle.net account associated with a single authenticator will be able to maintain your existing setup without needing to do anything. This change will only affect new authenticator attachments. But, if at some point you decide to detach the authenticator from any of your Battle.net accounts for any reason, you won't be able to reattach it if it's already associated with another Battle.net account.<br />
<br />
For more information on the Battle.net authenticator and mobile authenticator application (available for free with many mobile carriers), please visit http://us.blizzard.com/support/article/blizzardauth<br />
<br />
Cataclysm actually adds a couple of security features linked to the authenticator, you can now restrict guild ranks to people using Authenticators. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
AUTHENTICATOR_CONFIRM_GUILD_DEMOTE = &quot;%1$s can't be demoted to %2$s because that rank requires an Authenticator. Do you wish to demote %1$s to %3$s?&quot;;<br />
AUTHENTICATOR_CONFIRM_GUILD_PROMOTE = &quot;%1$s can't be promoted to %2$s because that rank requires an Authenticator. Do you wish to promote %1$s to %3$s?&quot;;<br />
AUTHENTICATOR_GUILD_RANK_CHANGE = &quot;This action would make the lowest guild rank require an Authenticator.&quot;;<br />
AUTHENTICATOR_GUILD_RANK_IN_USE = &quot;You can't set this option on a guild rank in use.&quot;;<br />
AUTHENTICATOR_GUILD_RANK_LAST = &quot;You can't set this option on the lowest guild rank.&quot;;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
There was also another weird authentication added to the game files a while back, it might be for internal use only and I decided it would be safer to hide the phone number just to make sure that I don't make Blizzard very sad. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
PHONESECURE_ENH_TEXT = &quot;For security reasons, please call +x-xxx-xxx-xxx from the phone registered on this account to validate this login attempt, and enter your PIN as well as the following security code: %d.&quot;;<br />
PHONESECURE_HEADER = &quot;Phone Call Required&quot;;<br />
PHONESECURE_TEXT = &quot;Please call %s from your registered phone, and enter your PIN as well as the following security code: %s.&quot;;#<br />
PHONESECURE_WAITING = &quot;Waiting for authorization... %d&quot;;<br />

This is a bad idea that only affects the honest ppl. Hackers can use the JAVA emulator on their PC to generate a new code every time they need to hack a new account.

You really can't say that. Like getting sick in real life, you can seriously minimize the probability, but it will ALWAYS be a possibility. I haven't been sick beyond a simple cold in years, probably havent been to the doctors for anything except acne in about 10 years, but over the summer i got hit with a major staph infection, it's kinda the same deal.<br />
<br />
And in that respect, i can't personally blame GL's who want to know who they put in power is protected.</div></div><hr />

i can see this beaing an option sens it will mean you need to use your Authenticator 2 times witch in turns means the thing that send the fake signal and logs in with the real key won't work all they will be able to do is walk around with your char and rep your gear. so the only option left then is to take a big sample and figure out the algorytmem for the Authenticator (witch i have only met one person who has done it basicly they dude who teaches the high math teachers how to teach and he did it on his online back thing for fun)</div></div><hr />

Where did you get half a million from? They will make much more than that with sales of the expansion.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Even if 5 million buy Cataclysm at an average of $40 each that works out at $200 million. I only used 5 mill as I know in many places no purchase of expansions is necessary to play.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Even if you do have an emulator (or you make your own version of the authenticator) you still need the serial number of the authenticator to make one that mirrors the one in use. Getting the Serial number of an authenticator is somewhat tricky too (and this will probably only work if the user has the mobile authenticator).<br />
<br />
I can't think of any good reason to have more than one battle.net account. You can have multiple wow accounts on a single Battle.net account.<br />
<br />
Edit...<br />
I see what your saying, you can use a Java emulator to have a fake authenticator, which is much more vulnerable to hackers. I don't think doing this will be too popular, and it will be a lot of work on hacker's part to detect the few users that do this.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also, that part about 12 million subscribers will be great to use on the threads claiming WoW will be dead by the next expansion or so.<br />
<br />
G-rank Authenticators: Even if you are smart enough to avoid hackers and cheap enough not to spend $6 on extra security, what if someone else in the guild gets hacked? You still lose out on the empty G-bank and waiting for your Main Tank to get his gear back from Blizzard.</div></div><hr />

I see what your saying, you can use a Java emulator to have a fake authenticator, which is much more vulnerable to hackers. I don't think doing this will be too popular, and it will be a lot of work on hacker's part to detect the few users that do this.<br />
<br />
Nah, he's trying to say that it doesn't affect hackers because they can generate new Authenticator serials in under a minute using an emulator.<br />
<br />
That isn't true though, at least for the Android Emulator, because it is linked to your Google account. This change was most certainly made to deter hacking, so hackers can't bind 150158 accounts with one Authenticator.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not all of us play on a &quot;supported&quot; platform. For example I run a 64bit install of linux, and use WINE to play wow. I surf with adblock/noscript/flashblock and firefox. Chances of having a keylogger on my computer targeting wow are low. Also even if I have a authenticator it doesn't protect me completely against key loggers. If i type it into the compromised machine all that needs to happen is for the logger to mess with the auth packets to bliz's servers and then log in using the plaintext versions that i typed in for them.[1] The phone auth parts intrigue me as it is much harder to find out both my fob authenticator and to know how to spoof my phone number, and which number to use. Also I think that caller ID faking is a federal offense in the USA. Anyways, I think that this will in effect help protect gbanks, and such, but I also think the retail boxes of Cata should just have a authenticator in them. <br />

This, pretty much I think it is a way in the long to term<br />
a) save players time with what I assume will be instant numeric PW sent to said phone (possibly)<br />

Because they cost money, and if I already carry a cellphone everywhere, why should I care anything else?<br />
<br />
No. That's not even true.<br />
Yes it is, don't talk about stuff that you don't know.<br />
<br />
Even if you do have an emulator (or you make your own version of the authenticator) you still need the serial number of the authenticator to make one that mirrors the one in use. Getting the Serial number of an authenticator is somewhat tricky too (and this will probably only work if the user has the mobile authenticator).<br />
<br />
I can't think of any good reason to have more than one battle.net account. You can have multiple wow accounts on a single Battle.net account.<br />
<br />
Edit...<br />
I see what your saying, you can use a Java emulator to have a fake authenticator, which is much more vulnerable to hackers. I don't think doing this will be too popular, and it will be a lot of work on hacker's part to detect the few users that do this.<br />
No, what I'm saying is that Blizzard is doing this to 'stop the hackers' but the hackers don't really need physical authenticators. They use the authenticator to stop players to get into their own account making them use one per account is just the same.<br />
<br />
Why wouldn't you put two accounts on the same Battle.net account? You can access them both at the same time even if they're on the same acconut.<br />
Let me give you a perfect example, if you play Starcraft you will need one battle.net account per region and there are seven(7!) regions, now you can see how walking around with 7 key-chain/authenticators is not very practical. And b4 some noob comes along saying &quot;why would you want to have all the seven regions? duhh&quot; I'll tell you the answer: pro-gaming on different tournaments around the world.<br />
<br />
Nah, he's trying to say that it doesn't affect hackers because they can generate new Authenticator serials in under a minute using an emulator.<br />
<br />
That isn't true though, at least for the Android Emulator, because it is linked to your Google account. This change was most certainly made to deter hacking, so hackers can't bind 150158 accounts with one Authenticator.It's true for the JAVA ones, which in Europe is what most ppl use on their phones.<br />
<br />
well if you have money for two or more accounts, one more authenticator wouldn't kill you.like I said above, the money is one part but its not all, why would I have to have several on my pocket all the time? its lame.<br />
<br />
Androidusers can download either FlexAuth (free) or mAuth ($2) wich both supports multiple tokens for Battle.net account.<br />
They both have a backup function for you tokens aswell, incase something will happen to your phone.<br />
Not sure if theres anything for iPhone yet.Again the JAVA ones are not like that.<br />
<br />
To sum up, I don't see ONE valid reason for them to do this except to nag players. It's just stupid! You already have to confirm via e-mail that you accept the addition or removal of the authenticator (finally). Also having hackers use the same authenticator is actually GOOD cause they will immediately know all the accounts that are compromised as soon as they catch one of the hacker's authenticator.<br />

Any guild that has a guild bank that has expensive stuff will use an authenticator, at least for the pages that have expensive stuff on them. Its a great idea to have an authenticator. 5 extra seconds to log on every time and 7 dollars is a much better alternative to the 5+ days it takes to restore your account on the super low off chance you DO get hacked (not to mention all the frustration caused by it).</div></div><hr />

Blizzard makes NEXT TO NOTHING from China. They make about 1.50 USD per sub/mo, because almost all of the money goes to the licensee that runs the game in China. Its the same with other places that do it this way. While its still a massive amount of money, its not anywhere near what people in this thread are saying.</div></div><hr />

A lot less people then you think have quit WoW because of ICC. The vocal minority goes to the forums to complain, but keep playing, and the silent majority doesn't give a shit about ICC and is still playing. Contrary to popular believe, not everyone raids.</div></div><hr />

Not sure how you do your maths but 11 million players at 40 dollars a pop is 440 million dollars (almost half a billion) not half a million. And 11 million subs at $15 a month is 165 million per year in subscriptions.</div></div><hr />

We've had that requirement for over a year. Until this patch, however, there's been no way to enforce it since we rely on the officers being honest when they say they have an authenticator.</div></div><hr />

This is a bad idea that only affects the honest ppl. Hackers can use the JAVA emulator on their PC to generate a new code every time they need to hack a new account. Us gamers, if we have, lets say... 2 accounts and use something like a mobile authenticator we will have to buy a NEW DAM PHONE just to keep the 2nd authenticator.<br />
Can I just ask who had this bright idea.... /facepalm<br />
<br />
About the lock changes<br />
I couldn't care less<br />
<br />
Please explain to me how you see that this is a problem, because I really see no problem at all. If you have two Wow accounts you can easily merge them into 1 Battle.net account (this has been possible for ages) and secure that Battle.net account with an authenticator. This even makes it easier to log in to Wow so there's no reason not to do it.<br />
<br />
If it's not actually both your account but one of you and one of your friend, then you friend can just get an authenticator, for example on this own phone.<br />
<br />
And even then there's no reason to buy &quot;a NEW DAM PHONE&quot; because you can just get a separate authenticate from Blizzard for about 6 euros.<br />
<br />
Finally if you have 1 authenticator on 2 accounts right now, nothing will change. You can still use that 1 authenticator for both accounts until you somehow decide to detach it from one of them.<br />
<br />
Plus, if all of this is too hard for you to comprehend, an authenticator isn't even really necessary. If you just take good care of your password, have a strong password, change it often and don't share it with other accounts (like you email) then there's really no reason to have an authenticator in the first place.<br />
<br />
TLDR: think before you post and don't bash at Blizzard if you can't comprehend that this is actually no problem at all for you or other Battle.net account owners.</div></div><hr />

Hence why i do not have an Authenticator, I am not paying $20 postage for something that weighs well what nothing. Talk about being ripped off.<br />
<br />
Then you're doing something wrong. And anyway, you're paying about that much a month to play the game, so why not just secure your account? Or just get the app on your phone. Then you'll never get TRULY ripped off when someone hacks your account and makes off with all your hard-earned gold.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Subscribers are accounts with an active subscription. This differs from the term &quot;active players&quot;, which means people who actually play the game. What the difference is? Well a few months ago I bought a 6 month subscription, so for the 6 months after that I had an active subscription. However one month after that I unexpectedly had to stop playing to focus on school and work, so for about 4 months I did not play at all. So I wasn't an &quot;active player&quot;. Furthermore someone with 2 or 3 accounts has 2 or 3 active subscriptions, while there is only 1 active player behind it.<br />
<br />
If many people do that, there is a big difference between the number of active subscriptions and active players. Perhaps of those 12 million subscriptions only about 50%-75% are actually active players (6-9mln). And maybe even of those players, only a certain percentage are really active players, whereas some might only log on every once in a while to hang out with some friends, etc, perhaps in anticipation of Cataclysm.<br />

Not really, no. If you use a very secure password and take good care where and how you use that password, then you will not be hacked and you will not need an authenticator. If you are sloppy yourself and somehow lose your password (for example using the same password for your Battle.net account and Facebook account, or don't have a virus scanner, or have the same password for three years) then it's your own damn fault.<br />
<br />
The only thing the authenticator does is add an extra layer of security for ignorant and sloppy people. It's not required at all, but if you don't take care of your passwords very well it lowers the risk of being hacked a lot.<br />
<br />
Futhermore, setting the authenticator to a rank is an optional setting, it's not enforced in any way. So it's up to the person who sets the ranks (probably the guild master) to decide if his/her officers need authenticators or not. And if none of the officers want to get an authenticator, the guild master will soon find himself without officers. So it'll balance itself out quite nicely.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. Authenticator is basically guaranteed<br />
2. Guild is making people to pay for the authenticator rank, Blizz only makes it possible<br />
3. Its not mandatory. You can still play the game and even be in guild that has that rank.<br />
4. Obvious troll</div></div><hr />

<br />
So if your an officer in a guild and the GM decides he wants only people with authenticator to have access to officer channel and guild bank, you basically get stripped of all your privileges and have no way to get them back because Blizzard does not offer a means to pay for an authenticator (which you wouldnt have needed in the first place, aka making you pay extra for something you dont need).<br />

<br />
Right.....<br />
<br />
<br />
No, you are incorrect.<br />
<br />
&quot;World of Warcraft subscribers include individuals who have paid a subscription fee or have an active prepaid card to play World of Warcraft, as well as those who have purchased the game and are within their free month of access. Internet Game Room players who have accessed the game over the last thirty days are also counted as subscribers. The above definition excludes all players under free promotional subscriptions, expired or cancelled subscriptions, and expired prepaid cards. Subscribers in licensees' territories are defined along the same rules.&quot;<br />
Here's a quote on how they count the number:<br />
<br />
Now you could claim they're simply lying but you'd have no proof of that so you're just making silly and uninformed claims :&lt;<br />

Yes, that's exactly how it'll work. No, it's not a legitimate concern. Yes, you're a troll.<br />
<br />
It's entirely optional, but every guild leader worth his/her salt will be setting the authenticator requirement for the officer tab, and limited withdrawals for the rest, so that no-one can withdraw more than 100g worth of stuff if they get hacked. If you don't like it, tough luck! Start your own guild with weaker security requirements.</div></div><hr />

Wait until it's the third time your guild bank gets emptied.<br />

You'll be able to get stuff from the guild bank after this change. You will just have to ask someone. We (my guild's officer staff) consider this a worthwhile trade-off between convenience and security.</div></div><hr />

This sounds like &quot;QQ I cannut be a officar in mah guild no moar QQQQQQ *tears*&quot;<br />
So effing what? You cannot enjoy the game if the guild master decides officers need authenticators and you cannot get one for whatever weird reason you make up and cannot be an officer?

Sorry but your math sucks as much as his<br />
<br />
they make 165million per month not year. What you did was 11mln * 15$ = 165m$ instead of 11m*15$*12months = 1,980 BILLION per year [because 165m * 12 = 1,980B$]</div></div><hr />

<br />
$180million X12 months in a year = 2.16Billion from subscriptions alone.<br />
You don't really have to calculate anything to guess the revenue they make from subscriptions, you can just check their annual report of 2009 (google).<br />
<br />
If you don't want to read it, they made 1.199 billion from &quot;subscription, licensing and other revenues&quot;, with &quot;other&quot; meaning anything except product sales, in 2009 and 1.154 billion in 2008, obviously that number hasn't jumped to 2 billions, it's most likely still around that 1.2 billion mark. If you want an explanation, here's a news flash: The subscription model is different in other countries and countries with much lower income per household and much lower living costs would obviously pay less for a WoW subscription.<br />
<br />
Some small fun facts for those who claim Blizzard is swimming in money, they made a profit per share of 9 cents, which is roughly 1% (no dividend) and the value of their shares is less than it was one year ago, the same as it was 3 years ago and it's only slightly more than it was 5 years ago (although I'd have to admit that they're rather volatile, so it's hard to nail a longterm development). To me that doesn't look like a profit mongering company, it either looks like a company which is badly managed or a company that invests all their earnings into products and could care less about it's shareholders interests.</div></div><hr />

For example I run a 64bit install of linux, and use WINE to play wow. I surf with adblock/noscript/flashblock and firefox. Chances of having a keylogger on my computer targeting wow are low. Also even if I have a authenticator it doesn't protect me completely against key loggers. If i type it into the compromised machine all that needs to happen is for the logger to mess with the auth packets to bliz's servers and then log in using the plaintext versions that i typed in for them.[1] The phone auth parts intrigue me as it is much harder to find out both my fob authenticator and to know how to spoof my phone number, and which number to use. Also I think that caller ID faking is a federal offense in the USA. Anyways, I think that this will in effect help protect gbanks, and such, but I also think the retail boxes of Cata should just have a authenticator in them. <br />

You know the &quot;I use Linux so I'm safe&quot; argument is usually a pretty good one, but in this case I question it. I assume (though I could be wrong) that you use add-ons. Most people do. Add-ons have been compromised in the past, and by their very nature (WINE is creating the binary compatibility for the malware as well as the intended software) add-ons will work with any system WoW works with. You're essentially creating a back door for at least some kinds of key loggers. Granted you'll only be vulnerable inside WoW, but that's pretty much what we're talking about here isn't it? You're almost certain safer than a Windows user, but I don't think even you are completely safe.<br />

People have tried this logic before, but it doesn't make sense. Subscription numbers are a direct indication of quarterly profits. They are the sort of thing that if you lie about them, nice men from the FTC (in the US, and similar EU regulators) come to your office and start using words like &quot;Misleading investors&quot; and &quot;insider trading&quot;. Blizzard isn't lying about subscription numbers. They're easy to check, and bad to lie about. You can say nothing at all; that's perfectly legal and reasonable, but you can't lie.</div></div><hr />

If you don't have a credit card and your phone is not suited for the authenticator application, you can not get an authenticator and do not have access to privileges in game that you used to have.

<br />
Blizzard will have to come with different payment options or find a different way to solve their own safety problem.<br />
1. Blizzard guarantees absolute safe access to their game. They have never been hacked in anyway. They can't, however, guarantee that YOU keep YOUR PC safe. To HELP YOU, they offer an authenticator, so you can improve YOUR security. There is no reason to give this for free, but they did decide to keep the costs very low and not charge for shipping.<br />
<br />
2. They don't demand an authenticator for certain guild ranks. Players will. These players already demand that, by demanding you show your Core Puppy before getting promoted to certain ranks. Now it's easier for these players to make sure the people they promote really have the authenticator. It's also not Blizzard's flaw that people rob guildbanks.<br />
<br />
3. True that Blizzard should add different payment options.<br />

4. Again, the authenticator is not mandatory for a full gaming experience. You can experience EVERYTHING in the game without one, including being a GM or Officer. You won't be able to be a certain rank in guilds that demand an authenticator, but likewise you will not be able to join any and all guilds that you want (try joining Ensidia...). It's no more restricted then it was before.<br />
<br />
5. Again, yes, there should be more payment options, but, also again, it's not Blizzard who has a security problem when YOUR account gets keylogged. It would be their problem when their servers got hacked.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
If you don't have a credit card and your phone is not suited for the authenticator application, you can not get an authenticator and do not have access to privileges in game that you used to have. You can troll all you want, but Blizzard needs to make authenticators available to everyone if they want to make this change.<br />
You lose as much privileges as the GM wants. It's not Blizzard that takes it away, it's your GM. He could also just decide you're stupid and demote you for no reason at all. Would you whine to Blizzard about losing privileges then, too?</div></div><hr />

No, Debit cards often fall under them. My Debit card is a Visa. The only difference between a credit card and a debit card is the latter is money you actually have.<br />
<br />
I've never in my very short time of having both, encountered a situation where i couldn't use my debit card in place of a credit card. Which is good because i freaking hate using money that technically isn't mine.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Becuase if you were, for example, dumb enough to log in to your email in an unsecure internet cafe on your vacation in Spain and your password got stolen there, you are unaware of it. If you change your password regularly (say once a month), your possibly stolen password is invalidated within a month.<br />
<br />
Or what about when hackers steal a website's entire database with passwords, and the website owner fails to mention it to the visitors? If you change your password once every month, in a month the stolen password is invalidated.<br />
<br />
Maybe a co-worker or friend saw you type in your password some time? They don't really think about it at first but later they decide they want to &quot;borrow&quot; some gold from you, so they try to log in to your account. But luckily you changed your password last week, so he can't log in.<br />
<br />
There are countless scenarios which justify changing your password regularly. I'm not saying it's more secure for you directly at this point in time, but it's good practice and helps avoiding certain scenarios. It's not a magic cure either, it has to be combined with other security measures (like authenticators, strong passwords, etc).<br />
<br />
And to say you never had issues with it, doesn't say anything. I haven't been ill for 4 years but does that mean I can't get ill? If only that were true...<br />
<br />
Edit: supplying an authenticator with Cataclysm is the best option imho. Then everyone who buys the product gets the same security measurements as well. And it's not like they have to make a profit from the expansion sales, because they already have a huge profit each month from subscriptions. Even if the expansion would be 5€ more it would acceptable.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Blizzard can not guarantee safe access to their game, therefore the users have to pay extra to solve Blizzard's problem. Now they want to enforce that by demanding the use of an authenticator to gain a certain guild rank, a.k.a. they are making the users pay for their own flaws.<br />
Then there is the problem of payment, not everyone has a credit card (though I heard different stories about the US) and therefore not everybody can pay for an authenticator. If the authenticator is not available to everyone, how can you possibly make it mandatory for full gaming experience? <br />
<br />
Blizzard will have to come with different payment options or find a different way to solve their own safety problem.<br />
<br />
now, its the users who cant keep their account safe, getting keyloggers from god knows where/ or just not having proper updated anti-virus software, having same password for email and b.net account. and because so many people just cant keep their account safe, blizz made us a favor, and gave us another reason to install an authenticator, which helps ALOT with security.</div></div><hr />

I think you missed the point he was making, it's not about the price of the authenticator but its availability and means of gettin one = they are limited.<br />
The point he was making was the fact that if they implement an &quot;option&quot; like that in game they should also figure out how to get it to people who don't, for example have a credit card or have a card which is not accepted by the blizzard store site or blizzard in general. Also if we come to authenticator applications for moblie phones, not every phone model is supported and I doubt a lot of people will buy a new phone just to get it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, you are NOT forced to get an authenticator - the guild rank is OPTIONAL. O-P-T-I-O-N-A-L.<br />
Some people really don't care about getting an authenticator and may see this as a legitimate concern. Just because you don't think it is, this does NOT mean that they are 'trolling'.<br />

<br />
I don't think that would work. One of the posters above said it costs them $30 to get an authenticator in Canada because it is classified as an &quot;encryption device&quot; and has some kind of an import tax I assume? The same seems to go for other countries as well. If this is correct, it would raise the cost of the retail box by a lot.<br />
<br />
Also, they wouldn't be able to get authenticators to people who downloaded the game, and many people who already have authenticators would be left holding an &quot;extra&quot; one for no purpose.<br />
<br />
Perhaps instead Blizzard could include a coupon - redeemable for an authenticator - with perhaps a rebate for people out of country who have to pay for the added tariff? Dunno.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you use an emulator on your PC, you just fail at understanding the concept of that device..<br />
<br />
Actually, you're wrong. Keyloggers interpret keystrokes, not displayed images. The android authenticator displays the code as an image generated from an integer, not an integer or string that can be parsed. Even if there was something that could access the initial integer, the Android Developer Emulator functions in the same manner as a VM in that it operates free of your PC. A virus in a VM can't reach your PC unless you have networking enabled, and a vice versa. It would be the exact same thing as having an authenticator on your phone--any malware on your PC is completely oblivious to it's existence. It can't see inside the VM in the same way that your PC can't see inside your phone unless you allow it from the phone's side.<br />
<br />
In many ways the emulator is more secure than the actual device. A Key Fob can be stolen, an emulator can't without access to your installation directory, and if a virus has access to your installed files you have more to worry about than your WoW account.<br />
<br />
The key fob can run out of battery, the emulator can't so that's another plus.<br />
<br />
So the authenticator itself is unhackable, even emulated on a PC. At least until someone makes something that can intercept all phone authenticators.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Blizzard don't make them nor do they own the patent for the authenticators. A separate company Vasco do. And they have other customers and clients to fill orders for , Not just Blizzard.<br />
<br />
The fact that the Blizzard store has run out of authenticators several times should be a direct concern for you - how do you expect them to fill the millions required for a Cata box in if they can't even produce the authenticators fast enough to keep the Blizzard store stocked ?<br />
<br />
Also I feel I should point out that a in box authenticator would still be a physical encryption device. A bomb doesn't suddenly become not a bomb because you wrap cardboard around it. Nor does a pack of C4 suddenly become invisible when tapped to the inside of a suitcase Like wise an authenticator _remains_ an authenticator even when put inside a box. Blizzard have yet to discover teleportation so at some point the authenticator would have to be accounted for when shipping it.</div></div><hr />

Has the world really gotten so bad that people can't even take the time to know even a hint of what they are talking about anymore?<br />
<br />
Say it with me people. Blizzard does not count canceled, inactive, or trail accounts. They only count accounts that either are paying for the service, or have been active in the last 30 days.<br />
<br />
Yes, this means maybe someone signed up for six months and then quit after ten days, that does not matter to Blizzard, because his account is &quot;active&quot; as long as he is paying and didn't hit the cancel button on the website. Yes, this means some people are probably counted multiple times due to multiple accounts, this does not matter to Blizzard stockholders because they are still paying per account.<br />
<br />
Why is this so hard to grasp? I just don't understand.<br />
<br />
Right now there are 12 million active accounts (Aka either being paid without cancellation, or being played within 30 days) in the game, and that's all that matters to Blizzard stockholders.</div></div><hr />

Gah, can't you read or something? It says right there in the press release which accounts are counted. They only include accounts with an active sub (or gametime).

I can confirm this for UK players, I have just ordered one and I was able to chose electron on the actual payment screen, and it included free delivery as well so it was only £6.29<br />
<br />
From the blizzard EU store:<br />
<br />
Shipping fees have been waived on this product to reduce the cost to the consumer, and the new price for each Authenticator has been adjusted to cover the new lower shipping cost (6.99€ / 6.29 GBP per unit). For example, if you purchase 1 unit, the final price will be 6.99€. If you purchased 2, the price would be 13.98€, and so on, with no additional shipping costs. The special price is only available for orders composed exclusively of authenticators. You can order up to 3 Authenticators at once. As a result, shipment tracking is not available and your order may take up to 3 weeks to arrive. The authenticator may be associated with your World of Warcraft account(s) through Account Management when it is received.</div></div><hr />

No, Blizz is allowing your Guild Leader to chose to require you to have an Authenticator in order to hold certain ranks. Blizz is requiring nothing. If your guild leader chooses to use this function it's his/her choice. I would. I've seen too many guild banks cleaned out by hacked people. It's happened to both of my current guilds at least once, several times in the case of my larger 25 man guild. All &quot;officer&quot; and &quot;raider&quot; level players are required to have Authenticators in both guilds now. We use the &quot;Puppy Test&quot;. <br />
<br />
This is a good change. It takes something a lot of guild were doing anyway (either just by relying on their members to be honest or by looking at Core Hound Pups), and builds it in directly.</div></div><hr />

About 40%, from last available info (beyond the press release).<br />
<br />
Note that, regarding asian accounts, those accounts work differently. Most asian accounts work on a by-the-hour model rather than the subscription we use. As a result, people having multiple accounts is more common than here: as long as you don't play a given char, your time doesn't decrease, so it doesn't matter if your 6 chars are on one account or six accounts. At least with six, you can multibox if you need to (and that's why they count them as active if they logged in during the last 30 days - you can let your alts lie dormant for months if you multi-account)<br />
<br />
That's also why their revenue is low compared to 12 million x 12 months x 13-15$. The asian market is larger, but brings a lot less (and the local operators actually get the money from the players, so Blizzard's revenue here is what the game operators pay back Blizzard... but they don't incur operating costs on that)</div></div><hr />

You are able to easily write a java application that replicates a valid mobile authenticator. For this to happen there are 3 parts to the authenticator algorithm otherwise the code would be invalid. Two of the parts are easy to get the serial and the current time for Blizzard. The harder part which requires an infected phone or computer is the internal file that handles the &quot;token&quot; that is in a encrypted file. Because phones are unable to process huge algorithm and there is not normally a need to have a well encrypted file on a mobile device the file is easy enough to decode. In the end the hacker harvested the serial, and this token from somebody. They cannot access your account unless they have your username and password.<br />
<br />
The user you quoted made a valid statement but much of it was &quot;incorrect&quot; or allowed people to come to the wrong conclusion. They are unable to generate new authenticators they can only generate authenticators they already know about. They could have written an application to automate the harvesting of said serials and gather the required data I suppose but its still miss leading.</div></div><hr />

One of the posters above said it costs them $30 to get an authenticator in Canada because it is classified as an &quot;encryption device&quot; and has some kind of an import tax I assume? The same seems to go for other countries as well. If this is correct, it would raise the cost of the retail box by a lot.<br />
<br />
Also, they wouldn't be able to get authenticators to people who downloaded the game, and many people who already have authenticators would be left holding an &quot;extra&quot; one for no purpose.<br />
<br />
Perhaps instead Blizzard could include a coupon - redeemable for an authenticator - with perhaps a rebate for people out of country who have to pay for the added tariff? Dunno.<br />
<br />
<br />
Except any program designed to intercept ANY authenticator code means the account is already compromised. So using a phone emulator is a perfectly valid solution to those people with no other choice.<br />
<br />
Blizzard is meet the current demand for the physical authenticator because they are limited to the number of authenticators they can buy from the company that makes them. The company in question has customers with higher demand then Blizzard.</div></div><hr />

Apparently (I did not check it myself, so sorry if I copy too blindly ;) ) numbers actually have even dwindled a bit during WotLK; the only reason it went slightly up again is because right now there is some deal in Korea where buying wow classic delivers a free month sc2, for in total a sharply reduced price. And, possibly, the lowpriced expansion in China. The question is how USA and EU developed over time.<br />
<br />
The same observation mentioned that during the rather casual-challenging times of BC, customer numbers grew pretty fast; during the WotLK period, numbers have stabilised or even dropped a bit. So despite Blizzards attempt to make the game more casual-friendly, the lack of challenge may not have brought Blizzard the result they wanted. If that observation holds and is seen by Blizzard, it gives hope that Blizzard will stay focussed on bringing some challenge back in the game, rather than listening too carefully to requests for nerfs.<br />

12 million active accounts is 12 million active accounts, just because there is a promotion, changes nothing.<br />

Multiply your &quot;half a million&quot; figure by about 1000x (that makes half a billion, since you appear to be numerically challenged.) That's how much Cataclysm sales will actually be bringing in, unless I missed something and they're selling it for 4 cents per copy.<br />

Got curious about something and thought you would like to read this:<br />
http://www.bungie.net/News/content.aspx?cid=28805<br />
<br />
Even if you only limited say the xbox live (and this is not including the microsoft live games) a typical usage for gaming is enormous. The market for a crossover game is certainly there. There are &quot;supposed&quot; to be a few games working on it, but if that will ever happen? I doubt it to be honest. Maybe I could see it for the ps3. I think microsoft is way to into setting themselves up as the &quot;COMPLETE&quot; electronic entertainment center. WIth movies/music on demand etc. <br />
<br />
You could say &quot;well yeah, halo reach used in the above example is a fps. It has a much bigger audience than mmorpgs do and sure it will have a bigger player base.&quot; I agree, but then why would fable 1 and 2 still be so high on the xbox live activity charts per week.<br />
<br />
For those that don't know why we are discussing this in a WoW thread about their subs, it's just a discussion really about the explosive growth of entertainment. Movies are falling a bit in income because more people would rather pay 15$ to play online with friends. If that is through the xbox/pc or through WoW. Which is pc, but it's not comparable to say microsoft live games.</div></div><hr />

Is the game reaching its natural population maximum or is WotLK less appealing than Blizzard aimed it to be?<br />
<br />
I am not unable to, I was too lazy. But I just typed in 'growth of wow'; take the link with 'Analyzing WoW's growth by the numbers' and note that we indeed have reached a plateau since 2008. If you do not share with me the interest in the observation that the attempt of Blizzard to make wow more casual-friendly actually seems to have lead to a plateau instead of the in that link projected further grow... then I cant help it :). I find it enormously interesting, since it goes against the implications Blizzard made end BC that their new policies would work better than making a game that strongly caters to the hardcore raiders.<br />
<br />
As others stated, most likely, trading authorities would be very strict with Blizzard if it ever appeared that they played with the actual numbers. So I would stop doubting the numbers. However, I find the discussion on the numbers logical since people wonder what the spin is Blizzard wants to give - and I think the spin may very well be what I referred to. Food for thought.<br />
<br />
Well there are things you aren't taking into account either. Face it free mmo's, games like gw where you pay for the game and that's it, and microtransaction games are picking up speed. <br />
1. current market, people may not like to admit it but the U.S. at least is in some serious financial trouble. <br />
2. Length of time. If you started playing say in highschool in when wow launched there is a real chance you are in college now and might be too busy to play. <br />
3. the numbers aren't calculating how many have been around since day 1, versus new players. MMOs just have a limited market, and they are all trying to get at that limited market. <br />
4. people may not want to believe it, but WoW does have competition. It's a simple fact. There are other mmos, and there are single player games that mix some of that. (take fable 2 for example, but also look at the huge success of things like the halo franchise)<br />
5. social stigma associated with wow. Let's face it, we've all heard about the idiot that left his wife and kids to play wow, or the guy who went crazy and never left his home etc. Some people do listen to those things when making a choice of what to buy. <br />
6. There is also the change in blizzard as a company. They went from a company that really seemed to care about their players, to one that will make fun of them openly and tell them their feedback isn't wanted or needed. <br />
7. WoW is an old game. Face it, by today's standards it is antique. The graphics alone compared to most games that are either out, or being produced will put people off. <br />
8. The community has changed. When I first started reading the forums before wow launched things were different. People were nicer, but now things feel so elitist. If you don't do this on hard mode with less than 5 players in 25 you need to quit at life etc. When did the game devolve into a penis measuring contest? Yet that's what it has become. I told another user on these forums goto any other mmo forums where they discuss different games and not just wow. Read what they think about the community here. Even a mmo developer recently said they don't want the numbers of wow because that would bring in the elitist community of wow. (I will try to find a link) <br />
<br />
Those are just 8,but my point is that you are trying to say &quot;oh we don't have more numbers because of how blizz is trying to cater to casual players&quot;. You would be wrong, though that statement could fit into number 6. It's more likely a mixture of all of these, probably more number 1 than anything else. WoW has tons going for it, and it will continue to grow, but saying that it's slacked off because of things being easier is just more of number 8.<br />
<br />
I assume this is the one you are referring to:<br />
http://www.massively.com/2009/01/09/analyzing-wows-growth-by-the-numbers/<br />
<br />
Scroll down that and read the first post. Also yours was a little misleading. If you look after the huge initial jump in growth you can see that from 06 to 07 growth slowed dramatically. It picked back up, but then slowed again, and this time kept slowing. They are talking in that article about wow reaching 13 million by the end of 09 but here we are near the end of 2010 and just now reaching 12 because of openings in the asian market.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sunseeker</div><div class="date">2010-10-09, 04:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">But 12 millions doing what? some servers are badly in need of merge and the reeason we got cross realm lfg was because numbers were at it worst. Beta servers are ghost towns, or at least is what a friend who also got beta invite told me. The last time blizzard spoke of a new milestone in terms of subscription was about 3 months before realasing WoTLK, so I don't buy it, not when what you read is not what you get in live serves, probably they meant 2 millions not 12.<br />
<br />
Beta servers are ghost towns because they aren't for playing they're for testing. And if you're not going to be testing then Blizz doesn't want you there. Sure, getting TONS of people in-game is a great stress test for the code, but that can be done on PTRs once the game itself is nearly finalized. <br />
<br />
Also: server merges are death knells in MMOs, Blizz wouldn't do it even if a server had one player on it. Not to mention now is the worst time to take a pulse check of how many people are playing. Many people like myself have reached a point in the current content that with the upcoming release of Cata, we don't feel there's anything productive to be gained in playing high-end characters.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Argroth</div><div class="date">2010-10-09, 05:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">12 million ACTIVE accounts seems like a little much too me. I can't fight it because I'm not gonna count each one myself but I think a lot of those accounts must be fake, or placeholder accounts or something or possibly they are actually counting many frozen or deactivated accounts.<br />
<br />
Although I guess the explanation of China makes sense.<br />
<br />
I find it hard to believe that WoW account numbers are growing... In my personal experience I have found more people quitting the game rather than taking it up recently (myself included).<br />
<br />
Counting American/Canadian accounts only I would expect falling numbers. people have put up with the same stale crap since ICC and many people don't want to fork out a subscription for the whole lot of crap they have been pissing out to tide us over. That and Blizzard seems to be more accessory-loving/money-grubbing/cheaper than ever with payed add-ons left and right (authenticator/mobile armory), needless money sucking only things like the pet store (at least the cards can stand on their own merit), and with small smay patches/useless 10 minute add-ons (RS-the new OS and the add nothing progressive Retaking of Echoisles/Gnomer) and brushing off promises like the Dance studio because they couldn't be bothered.<br />
<br />
Although I obviously see a boost in accounts for Cataclysm (I myself will probably crawl back) I actually kinda hope WoW will pass it's hay-day after that because of the horrible motives the company has seemed to adopt with all its power.</div></div><hr />

It costs just shy of 20 bucks to get the damn thing to Canada. CANADA.<br />

Dunno which part of Canada you live in but it cost me $6.50 and arrived in 2 days. I live in vancouver.</div></div><hr />

Maybe that is so - and there we both speculate since nobody knows - but for good order: I doubt it. But I bet Blizzard will not just accept that, so from their pov they still will try to get that ceiling up.<br />
<br />
Yes, I think it has reached it's plateau, and I agree that nobody knows for sure why. I tend to think the first thing, economics, is a huge part of it. I have talked to so many that just say &quot;it was either play wow or not eat for a few days a week&quot;. Now I don't think wow is overpriced for it's value, don't get me wrong. I think we are just in a bad state economically in the U.S. <br />
<br />
I think they will try to get the ceiling up, I think a big part of that was the recent push into asia. They put lots of work into changing things just for their version of wow. So it's got to offer them something very hefty in return. Blizz isn't the kind of company to do something without a return, but then what money making company is?</div></div><hr />

You speculate that they reached a plateau, I dont think they reached a plateau. I think they would do better if they made the game more challenging. But both of us speculate since none of us really knows.<br />
<br />
Ah, sorry for the misunderstanding. I honestly don't know. From what I have seen cata will introduce more challenges, though I think the biggest one will be enormous queue times. I have to admit I get tired of certain instances being too easy. I like the level of difficulty in halls of reflection. What I am worried about is that they might go overboard and make stuff hard just for the sake of being hard, instead of trying to make it interesting and fun. I hope that makes sense.</div></div><hr />

Math fail.... it would be ~$480 million to make the expac &quot;free.&quot; Half a billion dollars.<br />

<br />
Um, a few days a week times ~4 weeks per month is 8-12 meals. Who the fuck can live off of literally $1-2 a day (in the US)? WoW costs $12 a month in bulk, $15 a month individually.<br />
<br />
Your position is retarded. Entertainment spending goes up in a recession.</div></div><hr />
