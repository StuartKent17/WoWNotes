They were hated by a lot of people (not me). Their problem with those fights was that you had to quickly read all the abilities when you got in the vehicle. When this was on a harder difficulty, it proved to be an annoying and mostly unnecessary challenge.<br />
This wasn't a problem on flame leviathan because you had the vehicle from the start of the raid and cleared thrash with it. Though on Amber Shaper for example, you were randomly transformed mid fight. The malygos fight basically had the same problem.<br />
<br />
They could do it if they did it like in Ulduar, where you have a vehicle while clearing thrash and up to the boss.</div></div><hr />

well, If I was a dick, i would say either get better or use youtube. You will beat the mythic bosses eventually, it just might not be in the current patch. We have killed guldan literally yesterday, but we never saw a reason to complain about stuff, that guilds managed to do months ago, lets be happy those mythic only phases arent available only during cutting edge windows and dont disappear when the tier is over, so you can see it on your own pace</div></div><hr />

Having extra phases and mythic specific story lines is perfectly fine, it's not alienating anyone, it's rewarding those who actually put the effort in. As stated it's 100% fine to either A)put in the effort or B) pull up YouTube. When the game was in it's finest state only what 10% or less of the player base raided? Those crying that this makes new players not want to play have no idea what it's like to actually want to try at something and get a reward. When the sense of true progression and advancment is lost that is where the game starts leaking subs.</div></div><hr />

People don't need to ask why it's hard to find fresh blood. The answer is because the game is old. People have moved on. The game isn't a juggernaut that can keep 8-10 million players active during the entire year anymore. Folks reach the max level, see the content easily, then move on. Raid content has always been difficult. Finding quality players was only easier because more people played.</div></div><hr />

<br />
While I agree with you in the a vehicle fight would be fun. Flame Leviathan was fun as hell and required coordination just like any normal fight. And the vehicles scaled with gear so that was a plus to farming.<br />
<br />
However, the things you brushed off are valid concerns and why vehicles fights are reviled. When you change mid-combat, it gets very clunky even if you know abilities because you do not know how they will perform until you actually use it. Reading vs. doing is something that happens pretty much with everything and especially when you go from performing like normal to something not at all normal (see Amber Shaper). This problem did not exist on Flame Leviathan as you could use the vehicles for trash and right up to the boss. You at least got a feel for them before anything happened.<br />
<br />
I think the main problem is people dislike not playing their character and I understand that to some extent. I think maybe a compromise would be adding class specific abilities to the vehicle or something.</div></div><hr />

Challenging, engaging, overcoming limitations, fun, entertaining. All of this has NOTHING to do with story content being gated for only what? 5% of players to see? <br />
<br />
And because game is trying to catter to tryhards. Because actual mythic raiders are feel burnout.</div></div><hr />

Fixed 20 man Mythic raiding is not working well. Guilds are breaking up all over the place because they cannot compete with the recruitment boss. it's time to go down to a smaller raid size.<br />
We have had the same 22 players for two expansions now. Your leadership and raid atmosphere is the problem.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darknessvamp</div><div class="date">2017-06-01, 08:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Raiding has worked well so far this expansion. The team hasn't had to make any huge changes to raiding like they have in previous expansions.<br />
Except the fact that large numbers of players who want to attempt raiding at higher difficulties or in a new raid (I'm talking Heroic here) have been getting groupblocked by ilvl and AotC bullshit since week 2 of EN release. I'm all fine with actual gameplay difficulty stopping people from progressing into higher tiers but when players are stopping others from wanting to try because they demand they have an achievement they can't get unless they do the content they're grouping for or an ilvl that greatly exceeds the content they're grouping for then that's a problem. Group finder should be used for causal raid grouping and fill ins, not be some sort of faux-guild level standard of group recruiting that can be abused by those that have neither of the requirements they demand and still get carried.<br />

Just ignore him dude, he wants easy free shit on tourist mode.<br />
Having plot continuity across all difficulties is free easy shit? Da fuck? And watching it on Youtube is better?<br />

Guys, the whole game was like this at one point. If you want everything hand fed to you go play something else. That mentality is ruining the game. Special phases and story in mythic is what makes it awesome.<br />
Um aside from the recent addition of Mythic Difficulty no it hasn't. Yes top level difficulty has always had extra phases and mechanics included to make it more challenging but the plot threads and story has always stuck the same between difficulties at least until WoD. Shit like having Cho'gall show up in the middle of Imperator's fight on one difficulty and having Archimonde in the Twisting Nether doesn't make it inclusive. It just makes the writers job harder now as they go &quot;Well fuck how do we deal with the characters mentioning Cho'gall is dead when 90% of the player base think he escaped calling them fools&quot; or &quot;Do we write Archimonde as dead for real or keep bringing him back?&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Not all guilds can maintain this roster. And I don't care about those special snowflake guilds that have had the same 20 members since Vanilla, congratu-fuck-you-lations, this is the real world, and not every guild works like yours. Sometimes we raid with couples and that couple has a baby, or maybe someone gets a new job and their schedule changes... point is, shit happens, even with veteran raiders. What happens to a guild that's had the same Mythic tank for two years and he just suddenly goes? Do you think that's easy to replace? The role might, but the player isn't.<br />
<br />
I stand firm that 20-man Mythic blows, and will continue to keep players who WANT to see the content unable to because it's just not always possible to have a consistent 20-man roster. It's not news that maintaining this sort of roster is burning guilds out. As a co-GM and raid leader of my guild, I offer our recruits the world. We make good progression, we down bosses, and we have fun doing it... people will leave even under perfectly fine conditions. Whatever twat mentioned &quot;oh your leadership must be bad then&quot; has zero clue, and I'd contend he'd never led a guild in his life.<br />
<br />
Fix the 20-man restriction, it's holding people back that want to see this content.<br />

<br />
If you need as much as 10 people, and your entire server is recruiting, I'm sure there is another guild in the same situation ... so, work together, instead of against each other?<br />
<br />
Heck thats the biggest problem, people keep saying they can't get a 20 man roster up because of recruitment issues, but one of the reasons for that is that everyone clings to their guild, and therefor too many guilds are competing for a limited pool of people. If you are in desperate need of people, find another guild with the same problem, and merge.<br />

Any raid size would eventually have that problem. Reduce it to 15, and give it another expansion or so, and the same problem happens again. It would be a temporary band-aid at best. For encounter design the 20 man seems to work quite nicely.</div></div><hr />

If a guild wants to raid mythic - it's meant to.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Heck thats the biggest problem, people keep saying they can't get a 20 man roster up because of recruitment issues, but one of the reasons for that is that everyone clings to their guild, and therefor too many guilds are competing for a limited pool of people. If you are in desperate need of people, find another guild with the same problem, and merge.<br />
If people are having trouble getting the roster it's not their fault, it's the game's fault.<br />
<br />
10 man mythic raiding worked perfectly well for players, the only reason we don't have it anymore - is because it was inconvenient for Blizzard. And when they say that 20-man mythics works well, they don't mean well for players...</div></div><hr />

Clearly every social issue can be fixed by game mechanics! /s<br />

Get over it, 10m is long gone and buried. Either you adapt and give up on your guild pride and merge to be able to continue to play, or you perish. Its a simple enough concept.</div></div><hr />

Listening to toxic piece of shits like you all days every day? I would st8 tell you to fuck off and kill urself even as a blizz dev... You are the EXACT type of guy who was yelling back than that 10M guilds are &quot;less skilled&quot; than 25M guilds and 10M world first was not legit...<br />
<br />
You dont have to be captain obvious to realize that it is working well for them to roll out content in way better way than they did in past... However the amount the real problem is a community not a game... because everyone GM Dickhead with his own Methorenity guild and feels like a boss, hence why you have tons of 10m like guilds which would not merge with other guild to make a 20m mythic group. So it is not the game its the ego which ppl somehow created by playing the game way too much or way too long... <br />
<br />
And of someone response to this with something like &quot;I play from &lt;insert random xpac&gt; or I'm mythic raider... well fuck off everyone can learn it.. you can literally learn to raid lead if you put a bit of time and buy a decent microphone, it's not hard to do it, just not a lot of ppl wants to do it..</div></div><hr />

I agree this mythic &quot;20 man is too much&quot;, stems from Flex raiding being usually done with less then 20 to be &quot;optimal&quot;<br />
<br />
I would love to go to 20-man only raids, 5-man only dungeons. <br />

Put all guilds on the same EXPECTED size which is 20 and things will work itself out, as long as they don't add 3-tank fights or something.</div></div><hr />

<br />
and why shouldn't they? I know it might seem weird to many when a normal millennial scrub such as myself defends the right to have &quot;gated&quot; mythic content but maybe it's because I have expectations from myself and know that I'm simply unable to accomplish such an achievement within the expansion it's in. Whether it's time constraints or simply being unable to mentally meet the demands and I'm okay with that. So I'm not able to see first hand, what, a fraction a percent of content or a different set of armor right now? Big deal. If it's something I'm actually interested in it'll be just as interesting to me when I pop open youtube or when I can do it.<br />
<br />
Some people need to stop taking it as some kind of personal attack and grow thicker skin when Blizzard has the balls to say &quot;you can't&quot; especially when we're talking about what is literally the cutting edge of raiding which represents, what, 5% of raiding guilds? <br />
<br />

There is room for flex I think still, perhaps I didnt make that clear.<br />
But that should be as far as the variation goes.<br />
So that transition from one to the other is just in difficulty, which in my opinion is what the barrier should be.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, Mythic has meaning.<br />
Therefore the fixed roster size is important.<br />
Flex isn't balanced.<br />
<br />
Flex in earlier formats, but mythic - the one that is meant to mean something, should have a consistent difficulty.<br />
Flex to prevent having roster breakpoints introduced randomisation into the mechanics, which is completely counter to any sort of ranking or measure of difficulty.<br />
<br />
The highest format should mean something, and that means working for it.<br />
Flex in earlier formats allows SOME adjustment, but it shouldn't be optimal to adjust away from that.<br />
That is why they should be flex +/- a few, but still aiming for around 20 so that there is little roster adjustment between them.</div></div><hr />

this applies to all raid sizes. They can make mythic raiding 10man, 12man, 15man, 17man, X-size, there will always be people who will complaint they cant find people to recruit. blizzard is trying to provide a blanket solution which is: we give you 20man, now reshuffle/consolidate amongst yourself and know this will be the only format for top raiding. after years of 40man raiding, 20man raiding, 25man raidings, they chose 20 as the most suitable amount for mechanics-purpose.</div></div><hr />

20-man strict requirement for top-level raiding isn't working for everyone. Not all guilds can maintain this roster. And I don't care about those special snowflake guilds that have had the same 20 members since Vanilla, congratu-fuck-you-lations, this is the real world, and not every guild works like yours. <br />
<br />
The real world is also this forum with shit tons of threads how awesome Classic was and how Blizzard should never have changed this and that and those and how it all went downhill.<br />
<br />
If we'd listened to all those people we would still have one difficulty (prolly original Naxx level) and depending on the actual raiding location two raid sized. 40 (MC, BWL, AQ, Naxx) and 20 (ZG and the other, smaller AQ)<br />
<br />
And if you cannot get any of that working, tough titties. So, now we at least have flexible raidsizes in 3 difficulties and ONE fixed size on the highes difficulty. Champions league.<br />
<br />
And probably to many people giving concise, good, clear feedback how a fight cannot be tuned in a fair way for two raid sizes (10 and 25, as it was for a time). A perfect world. Players gave perfect feedback, Blizzard's data supported it, they listened and reacted.<br />
<br />
But I guess it is a case of those players being idiots and Blizzard again listening to the wrong people?</div></div><hr />

Guilds are breaking up all over the place because they cannot compete with the recruitment boss. it's time to go down to a smaller raid size.<br />
<br />
As of 2nd of june 1041 guilds killed mythic Gul'dan, we will probably get to 1200/1300 when tomb is out so I don't think there is a problem with raid size. <br />
You either adapt and find a new guild or stick to heroic, guilds will always disband doesn't matter the raid size. After every tier or even mid tier people quit the game for different reason and some officer at some point give up on recruitment because of frustration.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Instead you want to punish the guilds that actually have a roster and either actively recruit new blood or merge with others. One of the major problems with 10/25 &quot;mythic&quot; raiding (yes, it was called something else at the time, but effectively it was the same) was that of tuning. You simply cannot tune a boss very tightly if you have to account for only 10 players being there. Most mechanics are either much simpler with fewer people (spread-the-raid ones) or much harder (require x people to do something).<br />
<br />
The amount of development time to balance both the current 20-person and a new smaller one is just detrimental to the absolute amount of raid content there is.<br />
<br />
As many pointed out before: This alleged &quot;difficulty to recruit&quot; is mostly based on raid guilds being too proud to actually merge with others. We have too many guilds and therefore too few people per guild...</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, the reason 10 man was removed is because it limits encounter design. It limits the type of bosses they can do because they can't expect you to have every class in your raid group. Apart from the obvious thing that you could never balance 10 and 25 man.</div></div><hr />

The ony way out is to recruit more than we need and bench people or have a 20-man group and just not raid when someone can't play. Both options sucks.<br />
<br />
Flex raiding was the best thing Blizz ever made for people like us, but I don't know what's the % of players in that situation to know if it's still viable to cut these kind of peaple from Mythic jus for a easier time tuning bosses. Blizz should have this info and apparenly it's still not enough people, so fixed 20-man is still here.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This dev team seems to underestimate the community's intelligence/memory. This looks like an excuse to explain why Emerald Nightmare was undertuned. If you remember Cataclysm's first tier, it was really hard, maybe harder, maybe easier than Firelands, but definetly comparable. The difficulty difference between Emerald Nightmare and Trial of Valor or Nighthold is just too great.<br />
<br />
Regarding the Mythic raiding size being 20 players, I'm fine with that. I really enjoy how this model works and I agree it would be impossible to tune if it was flex. And yes, my guild had problems with the recruiting boss, but I still think the raid size is perfect atm. It's just something we need to deal with.<br />
<br />
Other than that, for the next expansion, the gear item level system (including Warforged/Titanforged) needs to change. I don't think it's ok to be able to get a 925 item from a low Mythic +/LFR. I don't think it's ok to clear a Heroic raid and be able to get a higher item level than a Mythic raid drops. I think this for three big reasons: <br />
<br />
1-&gt; The grind becomes endless for some raiders until the boss is down. You can say that you don't need to be 915 to kill Gul'dan and I agree with that. But as long as you have the possibility to farm and make things easier through progression, your guild might consider you a slacker if you don't, and we all have families and work to do. In the past we had that old BiS list and it worked pretty well, the bosses even took longer to be killed.<br />
<br />
2-&gt; Sometimes it's frustrating to see people who don't do Mythic raids or high Mythic + having more gear than those raiders that are putting a great effort to progress with their guilds. They have to be a lot more commited and people who play WoW casually still have the possibility to have a lot more gear just because of luck/free time.<br />
<br />
3-&gt; Time between tiers need to be higher. Tomb of Sargeras is coming out and many good guilds have killed Gul'dan just a month ago. They could use a break. I really liked that we had long breaks between tiers in the past.<br />
<br />
These are only my opinions and I know most of you won't agree with me, but I really think that the game would be better if Blizzard solved these problems.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Heck thats the biggest problem, people keep saying they can't get a 20 man roster up because of recruitment issues, but one of the reasons for that is that everyone clings to their guild, and therefor too many guilds are competing for a limited pool of people. If you are in desperate need of people, find another guild with the same problem, and merge.<br />
<br />
Any raid size would eventually have that problem. Reduce it to 15, and give it another expansion or so, and the same problem happens again. It would be a temporary band-aid at best. For encounter design the 20 man seems to work quite nicely.<br />
<br />
True, I like the bigger size encounters, mostly because it makes room for error. And yes, we're in the works with another guild for merging, but it's harder said than done, each has their own history, their own ways of raiding etc. It's like getting married at first sight, most of the times it ends in divorce :D</div></div><hr />

Played this game since classic and i think the problem is not that there is only a 20 man mythic. The problem here is and i said that before the expansion: Going back to 20 from 10/25.<br />
<br />
Many guilds had there social sturcture for 10mans and it is mostly always easier to reduce your roster instead of expanding it. So you can argue that the mistake was back in Cata where they introduced 10 /25 as equal modes. My thought was always the way back will be hard as fuck when the small 10 man guilds were formed.<br />
<br />
But looking at 10man raiding now it was way more popular vs 25 so maybe they made a second mistake in raid size in WoD. Maybe after the mistake to split raids in Cata they should have settled for the more popular raid size or do 15 man<br />
<br />
It will take a lot of time to get people back to 20 man and forgot about 10man.<br />
<br />
btw: burned out mythic raider has nothing to do with raid size it is more the grind + raiding 3-4 days a week. Many raiders pre Legion logged in after work raided logged off. No way you can do that in legion. <br />
btw2: the ones you say all noobs should fuck off etc. consider that you not might have a &quot;World of Warcraft&quot; if you &quot;pro&quot; guys dont give blizzard enough money :P</div></div><hr />

Your post is full of bad comparisons and bad assumptions.

Stories were not told through raids the same way they are now. Now entire expansions are funneled into the raids in coherent ways vanilla/tbc neeeeever accomplished.<br />

<br />
This &quot;rose tinted glasses&quot; phrases gets thrown around left and right on this forum so much that it's lost all meaning entirely... <br />
<br />
<br />
First of all nothing I'm saying is based off assumptions, yes the game was newer and that most definitely added to its subscriber base but it doesn't account for all of it. The game had a very direct route of progression in vanilla, tbc, and even wrath. Attunements set the course for vanilla/tbc due to the game being in early development and the developers not really knowing how to set the pace for the game.<br />
<br />
As far as story telling in raiding goes wrath had an extremely coherent storyline told through its raids and dungeons. Almost the entire story of wrath was told as we reach northrend we quested in our respective zones, cleared out native threats(maly and sarth) then fought our first line of the scourge (naxx), we then worked our way into the northern hills of storm peaks where we freed the keepers of yoggs corruption and quelled the old god threat while learning that this very same old gods blood was used to construct ICC itself! We then went into icecrown and trained an army at the TOC raid, where arthas appears to intervene with anub and we again defeat him. We breach ICCs gates immediately after TOC and fight arthas the main featured villain who quotes everything we did in all other raids and how he pushed us to make us stronger so we could be his new army. <br />
<br />
Now tell me how the hell that isn't the ENTIRE expansion told via raids? If you just quested you had absolutely no idea wtf was going on in that expansion. Wrath set the pace for all future expansions and this was WITHOUT raidfinder and easy mode bullshit. If you weren't a hardcore raider back then you most definitely were not killing the current bosses at their time, exactly like now if you aren't a hardcore raider you aren't seeing the special mythic boss fights without YouTube. This isn't new, it isn't surprising, and it most definitely isn't unfair. <br />
<br />
Also to hit a few other marks you made:<br />
<br />
- I believe in wrath only 3% of the player base did pvp as it was unbalanced and shitty.<br />
- Players had plenty of ways to ease into current raids especially after they introduced 10/25 normal and heroic. If you wanted to raid, you did with ease. <br />
- tbc/wrath were and always will be the highlights of wows history as both games introduced much easier ways to get into raiding yet still offered a challenge unlike current lolfaceroll content(unless you're doing mythic which is pretty much perfectly tuned for the most part.)</div></div><hr />

Not all guilds can maintain this roster. And I don't care about those special snowflake guilds that have had the same 20 members since Vanilla, congratu-fuck-you-lations, this is the real world, and not every guild works like yours. Sometimes we raid with couples and that couple has a baby, or maybe someone gets a new job and their schedule changes... point is, shit happens, even with veteran raiders. What happens to a guild that's had the same Mythic tank for two years and he just suddenly goes? Do you think that's easy to replace? The role might, but the player isn't.<br />
<br />
I stand firm that 20-man Mythic blows, and will continue to keep players who WANT to see the content unable to because it's just not always possible to have a consistent 20-man roster. It's not news that maintaining this sort of roster is burning guilds out. As a co-GM and raid leader of my guild, I offer our recruits the world. We make good progression, we down bosses, and we have fun doing it... people will leave even under perfectly fine conditions. Whatever twat mentioned &quot;oh your leadership must be bad then&quot; has zero clue, and I'd contend he'd never led a guild in his life.<br />
<br />
Fix the 20-man restriction, it's holding people back that want to see this content.<br />
<br />
I like that you complain about raid size, then use a tank of all roles as an example. You know, the one role where there will be 2 of regardless of raid size from 10 man all the way up to 30 man...<br />
<br />
The number is just a number, if they swapped to 10 man then you'll have all sorts of people complaining about how they only have 8 ppl, why can't we do raids with 5 like we do M+? When you have much below 20, they found that it really limits what they can do to make a fight difficult and engaging. I personally wish we had 25 man back, or hell even 40, but I understand that with a smaller playerbase that becomes difficult. There needs to be a happy medium between raid size and raid difficulty (ie: tuning) and 20 seems to be it. <br />
<br />
Honestly If i had to gripe about one thing it's that how, as much as group finder has helped the game, it's also destroyed community. Once you destroy community you create much larger pockets of anonymity. When you have that there's no repercussions for players to be shits. Nowadays you have people who join 3/10M guilds to get the achieves then move to 6/10M for those then push to join the 9/10M guilds, etc... There's less loyalty and pride in who you are as a player or guild. RL will always cause setbacks, but with the right sense of value to a guild, players will come and players will stay, players will be more likely to be ok with sitting when another is better suited for a given fight because the guild getting the kill is what matters. I just want community back, I think it would bring a sorely missed element of the game back.</div></div><hr />

<br />
While I agree with you, I think there's been a philosophy shift since then towards retention of new players that hop in each xpac. There's also a true easy normal difficulty that lets players acquire the gear needed to power through heroic. Most importantly, they underestimated the power of M+ by quite a bit. At the time I was pretty much getting more upgrades from M+ than mythic EN (though 5 items should consistently drop in 20m imo). Titanforge gear from heroic that's stronger than base mythic too.<br />
<br />
To go more out on a limb here, imo the real/non-PR reason is they have a harder time tuning that first raid because it's a much wider gamut of player power and lacking live data to back it up. They have a much easier time going into later raids because they have real hard data from live/WCL. I know they have internal simming tools and an internal raid team, but it pales in comparison to the raw quantity of data they get from live, taking all factors into account (like the playstyle/talent build they think is optimal might not actually be the best)</div></div><hr />

I honestly don't understand how people can suck up this reusing of the same content over and over and over again. <br />
<br />
Beat Gul'Dan on LFR then go do Normal! Cuz he has slightly more HP and DMG. Then go kill him on heroic! Cuz he has slightly more HP and DMG. Want to do him another time? Go Mythic!!! It will feel really cool and epic to kill the same guy again we promise...<br />
<br />
Now Dungeons have the same concept. Actually, the dungeon system is even worse. Whatever. PvE is appearently not for me anymore.<br />

<br />
The hardest boss in this game, is the recruitment one. There simply is not enough players to go around to replace the ones who are leaving. <br />
<br />
A lot of guilds simply died on Mythic Spellblade/Krosus because they didnt have the numbers to get proper attempts in. Then when you are 3/10 and everyone else is 5/10 your appeal is gone and you in many cases simply never get it back.<br />
<br />
Now, theres an issue of skill - some guilds just arent cut out for mythic. Thats fine.<br />
<br />
Another huge issue is Mythic guilds churnining out Heroic players. They snap them up for warm bodies, they spit them out 2 bosses later and the heroic player says fuck this im done and the pool gets smaller.<br />
<br />
Something needs to be done server wise, if Blizzard wants to keep this 20 man raiding model up, it needs to merge many more servers or make server transfers much cheaper.<br />
<br />
When server transfers etc are so expensive, your recruitment pool is just non existent in some instances. Take for example OCE servers. There are IIRC 6 servers. Only 2 of which are worth playing on. Frostmourne and Barth. Guilds on the other servers are dropping like flies because the top 5 can just poach anyone with 910+ ilvl and use them for a warm body and kick them to the curb.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Easo</div><div class="date">2017-06-04, 07:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Instead you want to punish the guilds that actually have a roster and either actively recruit new blood or merge with others. One of the major problems with 10/25 &quot;mythic&quot; raiding (yes, it was called something else at the time, but effectively it was the same) was that of tuning. You simply cannot tune a boss very tightly if you have to account for only 10 players being there. Most mechanics are either much simpler with fewer people (spread-the-raid ones) or much harder (require x people to do something).<br />
<br />
The amount of development time to balance both the current 20-person and a new smaller one is just detrimental to the absolute amount of raid content there is.<br />
<br />
As many pointed out before: This alleged &quot;difficulty to recruit&quot; is mostly based on raid guilds being too proud to actually merge with others. We have too many guilds and therefore too few people per guild...<br />
<br />
Yeahh... except when you have small national guilds. And still, why would the merge be the answer?</div></div><hr />

Remember Algalon? Sinestra? Ra-den? We used to have whole bosses gated behind difficulty. And they had major lore implications. You are better than others, you get rewards,simple.</div></div><hr />
