Thanks for the feedback on this issue. It’s clear that we need to make some changes here, so here are our current plans:<br />
<br />
<br />
We’re removing the increase to damage dealt by creatures in the world. Our overall goal with this change is to keep the amount of time it takes to kill a creature from getting ridiculously short, and increasing the damage they deal is unnecessary for that goal. Instead, this was making you feel like they were becoming more dangerous, which was not our intent. We’re significantly reducing the rate at which creature health scales with your item level. Again, all we’re trying to do here is prevent cases where monsters die too quickly for players to react to their presence, particularly around World Quests. Our initial tuning was far more aggressive than it needed to be, which could make it feel like your upgrades weren't actually helping. This change will make it very clear that you are still becoming noticeably stronger than your enemies as your gear improves. Those two changes are already live, and you should be seeing them in-game now. Later today, we’ll be correcting a separate issue that’s causing unequipping an item to drastically alter the power of enemies you’re facing. The above changes make it so that’s never the right thing to do anyway, but this is still a strange/buggy interaction that needs to be fixed.<br />
<br />
It should also be noted that this change was on the Patch 7.2 PTR (and has been since January). We didn’t communicate anything about it initially because we wanted to get testers’ raw and honest feedback about it when they encountered it themselves, rather than attempting to pre-empt or otherwise influence their opinions ahead of time. When that feedback never came, we assumed that meant it was an acceptable change – i.e., those who hadn’t noticed it weren’t bothered by it, and those who had noticed it thought it was fine. Clearly that was a false assumption, and we should have drawn attention to it later in the PTR cycle, so that we could have caught these issues before Patch 7.2 went live.</div></div><hr />

Getting more powerfull should mean mobs in the outdoor world become easier and easier to kill to the point where you mow them down like a 4x4 down West Minster bridge. (too soon ?)<br />
Having them scale with your Ilevel so they just get harder than thier base amount completely negates the reason for getting better gear out side of dungeons and raids.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I appreciate that world quests and other content in &quot;old&quot; zones are now pressuring them to address such concerns as 1-shotting everything on the screen - BUT maybe WoW just is not the game for that sort of open world experience. It never has been, and with gear scaling as it is designed... maybe it never should be. I suggest Watcher tells the CEO to start up a new MMO project if they want to build this correctly from the ground up. WoW has never been a full MMO where the &quot;world&quot; was the experience.<br />
<br />
Trying to fit that in now.... just feels like a good design for a different game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh!, I have an even better question:<br />
<br />
Who would even bother going through the trouble to unequip an item just because to do so would give you an edge on killing a quest mob........ seriously? <br />
<br />
Those mobs aren't even that difficult for a fresh max character, you don't need an &quot;edge&quot; to kill them. <br />

They practically just fall over and die when they see you coming....</div></div><hr />

<br />
Funny thing is, I actually submitted several reports to blizzard about bizarre mob health where in some areas mobs are 1 shotable and others have 4-5 mil hp. I'm calling out blizz about this and saying that they ignored players and just said go with it which caused this backlash.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was surprised when my health was dipping on multi-dot situations (SPriest running San'layn) since usually I almost never have to shadow mend myself while questing. I just chalked it up to the new Legion area being more of an end-game area. I remember thinking that it was going to be a while before I could bring my alt rogue there or he was just going to end up getting worked.<br />
<br />
I don't mind there being more health on mobs since I have to ramp up my damage anyways, but the amount of damage being dealt was too high.</div></div><hr />

I'm a healing holypriest. Mastery does NOTHING towards my ability to kill mobs. <br />
So if I uneqip a trinket like http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/147007-the-deceivers-grand-design ...<br />

... my ilvl will drop significantly<br />
... this will reduce HP by a monster I am facing, thanks to the ilvl scaling<br />
... which means I can smite down the monster faster<br />

<br />
Not many people on the PTR with highly geared characters would have been testing the old content in the broken isles. I'd bet money that almost all the testing people did on the PTR would have been in the new zone, the Raid, the 5 man, and the new invasions. I can see where people just assumed that all those things were supposed to be tuned higher. I didn't do this PTR cycle but if I did I wouldn't have gone to the WQ in High Mountain to test them.</div></div><hr />

Lesson learned: the players who test on the PTR do not contain a representative sample of the whiny babies that play on the normal realms. Blizzard will need to keep that in mind for the future.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, here we are in 2017 and Blizzard still thinks people play PTR to test, and not to get advanced knowledge of the patches to get ahead of others who play legit. GG<br />
<br />
The moment I finished the Broken Isles content and went to do regular world quests I noticed this problem, literally on my first multi-mob pull. The mobs that should have been (and would have been before the patch) melting around me were actually surviving long enough for my dots to wear off, and putting up enough damage to be a threat. Didn't make sense considering I was suppose to technically be stronger.</div></div><hr />

<br />
¯\_(ツ)_/¯<br />
<br />
You'd think that they would've at least mentioned something about it though especially when people on the PTR are more focused on whether the content actually works and is playable and aren't really grouped with people and noticing weird changes with enemy health and damage values due to gear as they are not gearing up on there. -_-<br />
<br />
They should just scrap it all to be honest. Taking the same amount of time at ilvl 900 it took to kill a bear at ilvl 830 is not my idea of fun. Neither is it for slapping around that elite I'd just gotten used to bursting down.</div></div><hr />

I dont even know what the fuck you want from me. If you dont even understand how stupid something like this is, after they already wanted to improve on their patch noting of things after the shit what happened in 7.1 and now failed again with this change and on a few others, like Shaman DPS spec summons now being auto aggressive and causing wipes. They literally try to blame the testers for not testing/reporting an undocumented change, while apparently there was feedback ignored, like some people a few posts above yours indicated.</div></div><hr />

Its pretty simple: Unequipping an item should not make you stronger, if it does, then thats a problem, and something they are actively fixing.<br />
<br />
For Healers mastery often doesn't help to DPS, but if you feel like you need some extra help you should equip DPS trinkets and not just unequip some gear and get stronger from having empty slots.</div></div><hr />

I ordinarily disapprove of picking on particular devs--in fact, I always have before--but I'm starting to think that we have a real problem here. It's absolutely true that instead of just saying, &quot;OK, this is too hated, let's revert it&quot; they are intent on keeping some part of the system in.

So you are telling me that people WENT on the PTR with their &quot;live&quot; char and NOBODY NOTICED that some mobs on the shore were hitting like truck with gazziolion of hp ?<br />

And oh yeah, who goes and does emissary and dailies and what not on the PTR for shits and giggles? The content was the new Broken Isle area, dungeon and so forth. Not mob health and damage in Highmountain. <br />
<br />
Also since the change wasn't communicated, people could have brushed it off as they were just testing something. Similar to all those other times they do random stuff on the PTR to just test things out and they tell us they are just playing with some ideas. <br />
<br />
Once again, Blizzard failed to communicate changes to the core of the game, people don't play the PTR to test stuff, but rather to get a better knowledge of upcoming NEW content, and the developers are so out of touch with the player base it has never been more clearer.<br />
<br />
PS It will always be Battle.Net and not this Blizzard re-branding garbage they are doing , but alas that is another topic.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For Healers mastery often doesn't help to DPS, but if you feel like you need some extra help you should equip DPS trinkets and not just unequip some gear and get stronger from having empty slots.<br />
<br />
The trinket I linked adds 0 power to my smite, but adds &gt; 0 power to the monster I fight. <br />
As a healer, that trinket is a net loss in my relative power, and the short answer is: unequipping that trinket is a net gain for me. <br />
<br />
That I can swap trinkets for a DPS trinket is irrelevant here, is it not? <br />
<br />
I challenge the accurracy of the quote I quoted. Alternatively, I challenge that healers are treated as first class citizens. Either way.</div></div><hr />

(https://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20753319202). Thread didn't catch fire, however, and many of the quite well geared players shrugged. This is broken design. Well, to be fair, it's not broken design--maybe some demographic would love ever scaling stuff--but it's pretty detrimental to a game where the goal is to get better and better gear.</div></div><hr />

The trinket allows you to heal yourself for more, which can allow you to defeat stronger mobs then some DPSers can, even if it takes you longer.<br />
Just because you don't use a part of your toolkit when fighting trivial mobs doesn't mean it shouldn't be accounted for.<br />

Well it was definitely a LOT more noticable on my 900 Destro Warlock than on my 880 Guardian Druid. And 2 iLvl 900 mages in my guild echoed my exact same sentiments, saying they had been dying doing world quests they normally facerolled through, wondering what the hell had changed. I guess it was just far more noticeable on squishy clothies with limited self healing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For Tanks this was all most no change, squishy DDs had a harder time and healers got fucked hard.<br />
If they really want to scale things they should take into consideration which role they're dealing with at that moment, it's been a long time since healers needed extra gear or an off-spec to farm shit.</div></div><hr />

This is a terrible argument, and you know it. <br />
No world mob has any power capable of killing a healer regardless of gear. <br />
If it could, having a healer to quest would be mandatory. Any power I get from mastery is worthless in a world quest setting.</div></div><hr />

That's not a bad assumption though. Where it fell down, I think, is that testers probably had a higher level, are generally better players and have a higher tolerance for this.

&quot;Later today, we’ll be correcting a separate issue that’s causing unequipping an item to drastically alter the power of enemies you’re facing.

<br />
... I hear, &quot;We are going to how have enemies look at your Ilvl that is inclusive of that in which is in your bag. So if you really want to drop the enemy's health and make it easier, your going to have to delete your gear for good. kthnx&quot; <br />

<br />
Yeah, nice, just completely cut off the next paragraph where I explained why it mattered. The only time shit REALLY died in a single GCD like Blizz are saying, was when a warrior ran in and popped Draught of Souls. Or someone else ran in and blew all their CDs. Most fights on my warlock usually took a good 6-8 seconds (At iLvl 900, massively outgearing it) before the change. If a pack of 10 mobs drops me to 20% HP in that span of time, increasing their HP by 50% means it becomes a 9-12 second fight. That's going to result in me dying before killing everything. Sure, whatever, I can pull 7-8 mobs instead of 10. It's still going to take me 9-12 seconds to kill them but at least I won't die. But then to increase the damage they do by 50%, if I pulled 8 of them, they're going to do the damage that 12 would've during 7.1.5. That's going to kill me over a 9-12 second span. Literally have to pull a maximum of 5 at a time to be able to kill them all before dying, compared to the 10 I could pull before the patch. So your whole &quot;1 second becomes 1.2 seconds&quot; stuff is a load of horse shit.<br />
<br />
Obviously now they've removed the damage scaling, and made the health scaling nowhere near as steep, it's not a big deal, but the point is that before the nerf it really was, and not just as minor of an inconvenience as you make it out to be.</div></div><hr />

Still seeing it on the wow subreddit, &quot;raid geared players not killing mobs faster than a newly dinged 110&quot;<br />
Do you even reality bro.<br />
<br />
This change is needed since mobs were scaling as you leveled. Without a scaling system mobs are always as powerful as they were when you hit 110, but gear has made us 4 or even 5 times more powerful since. Killing mobs in 1 second isn't fun, and telling yourselves over and over that all you want is to be done with the quest is subconsciously false. You're not enjoying the combat because you never get engaged in it. Mobs hitting for 0.2% of your health and dying in 2 gcds is not fun in the slightest.<br />

But when you have to kill 100 of them its already 8 minutes more to grind you could've been spending on better things.<br />
<br />
And considering 100 is fart in desert when it comes to Legionfall or any WQ for that matter, you be spending hours extra just because you got lucky with titanforging or went to at least HC NH.<br />
So lets say you kill 1 000 mobs over two days in WQs. <br />
Not only they hit hard, making you probably take break with food, they also take 10 seconds more what they usually did.<br />
Thats almost 3 hours extra if you WQ's alone. Threeeee. Hours.<br />

<br />
Blizzard's reasoning made sense. As made the outcry that it was tuned too hard.<br />
<br />
They compromised, and swiftly.<br />
<br />
We can all put down the pitch forks as far as I'm concerned.<br />

<br />
Oh!, I have an even better question:<br />
<br />
Who would even bother going through the trouble to unequip an item just because to do so would give you an edge on killing a quest mob........ seriously? <br />
<br />
Those mobs aren't even that difficult for a fresh max character, you don't need an &quot;edge&quot; to kill them. <br />
<br />
They practically just fall over and die when they see you coming....<br />
<br />
when unequipping wrists meant mobs went from 3 to 2M and rares from 66 to 45M, while you barely lose anything, its obvious the system is broken. and yeah, i kinda doubt 45M elites are pushover for regular 846 char (thats what i had without wrists), that doesnt have 920 weapon and two legs, when alot of classes at 846 had issues with 10M bosses on pvp wquests..</div></div><hr />

There's no way players didn't notice. Maybe they didn't make a big stink about it because, hey, they said ilevel scaling would be feel really bad.<br />
<br />
Did you test the PTR? I'm assuming not as otherwise you would have simply stated that YOU did not notice but you didn't, you opened with &quot;I didn't believe them for a second&quot;, based on that you are just speculating and casting aspersions. They have no reason to lie about it being on the PTR, it achieves nothing other than distrust from players like yourself which is not ideal for them. <br />
<br />
<br />
I ordinarily disapprove of picking on particular devs--in fact, I always have before--but I'm starting to think that we have a real problem here. It's absolutely true that instead of just saying, &quot;OK, this is too hated, let's revert it&quot; they are intent on keeping some part of the system in.<br />
<br />
Who says it's too hated? It irritates me when people pluck &quot;facts&quot; out of their arse. Sure you hate it and maybe 3000 other people on this forum do too, then there's several thousand on the official forums and we can assume similar numbers on other forums out there, but that still does not account for the rest of the player base. Can you not understand that from a business perspective it is BAD to leave in any trace of a system that is universally hated and Blizzard is first and foremost, a business. <br />
<br />
<br />
I may have to leave this game because of Ion's direction...That's not something I ever thought I'd say.<br />
<br />
Do you imagine Ion sitting in a swivel chair with steepled fingers and a dastardly grin on his face in meetings? He is the game director, can you imagine being promoted to game director of WoW and Mike Morhaime saying to you &quot;By the way, you are game director but you can't change anything because the fans don't like change&quot;. Sometimes they miss big time with these changes but without change the game would just get stale and boring so he's damned if he does and damned if he don't.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Surfin</div><div class="date">2017-03-30, 08:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It should also be noted that this change was on the Patch 7.2 PTR (and has been since January). We didn’t communicate anything about it initially because we wanted to get testers’ raw and honest feedback about it when they encountered it themselves, rather than attempting to pre-empt or otherwise influence their opinions ahead of time. When that feedback never came, we assumed that meant it was an acceptable change – i.e., those who hadn’t noticed it weren’t bothered by it, and those who had noticed it thought it was fine. Clearly that was a false assumption, and we should have drawn attention to it later in the PTR cycle, so that we could have caught these issues before Patch 7.2 went live.<br />
<br />
<br />
Goes to show Blizzard either ignored the feedback to suit their argument or they not read the feedback. Plenty of feedback in this PTR thread:<br />
<br />
<br />
patch 7.2 making all the mobs/enemies etc harder/healthier/do more damage etc.<br />
<br />
Can someone on the PTR confirm or deny this?<br />
<br />
Literally (if they are doing this) what is the point? So we are getting more powerful but so are the mobs? I thought the consolation for us pet battlers, archaeologists (all professions really) with world scaling was that eventually we could get gear that makes world scaling &quot;trivial&quot;.<br />
<br />

<br />
i don't think that kind of thing belongs in an mmo. we're supposed to feel like we're getting stronger, and this entirely defeats that purpose.<br />

<br />
I am not denying it was broken, I just find it odd that someone would unequip items to get a creature to go from 3 to 2M health. <br />
<br />
All these mobs die in ten seconds are so, most people just round them up and aoe them down. Are you really going to unequip your item so the mob dies in 8 sec instead of 10? <br />
<br />
I play the game in my leisure time for fun, that seems a little too hyperfocused for me.<br />
<br />
As for the elite mobs, I was always on the impression that they were marked &quot;elite&quot; because they were meant for more than one player or for one player that is in nice gear.<br />
<br />
It's also a little hard to judge for me since my character is a tank, so even the blue elites won't be able to kill me solo.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you claim the changes are not something you noticed and barely changed anything, why add it in at all? As I said, if the purported reasons for adding the system were true, the developers have other dials and levers they could adjust without needing to invent and add another buggy system on top.<br />
<br />
For an expansion that many already view as incredibly alt-hostile (e.g. artifact xmog unlocks + nebulous dev message), why are people praising changes which only exist to lengthen grinds and increase the size of the time sink?</div></div><hr />
