Item Upgrades in Patch 5.3<br />
As you’re probably aware we introduced a new system in 5.1 which allowed you to upgrade some gear a few items levels at a time by paying with the PvE (Valor/Justice) and PvP (Conquest/Honor) currencies. In 5.2 the Voidbinders (NPCs who perform item upgrades) took a break to let people focus on just acquiring new items with their points. It also gave us time to evaluate the system, and decide how we want to continue supporting it.<br />
<br />
PvE Item Upgrades in 5.3:<br />
<br />
Voidbinders will return to their places in capital cities and shrines.<br />
Items upgradable by Valor now require 250 Valor to upgrade per 4 item levels, for a total of 500 Valor for 8 item levels per item.<br />
<br />
This is retroactive to all items that use Valor.<br />
<br />
<br />
5.2 Justice items now require 750 Justice to upgrade per 8 item levels, for a total of 750 Justice for 8 item levels per item.<br />
<br />
This is retroactive to all items that use Justice.<br />
This is higher than Valor to account for the increased acquisition rate of Justice since patch 5.2.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
We still like the upgrade system for PvE as a way to make steady progression against bosses you can’t quite kill yet. You very predictably earn Valor every day, and use that Valor toward increasing your character’s power and overcoming an obstacle. It’s also good that Valor always has a use; it’s a currency we always want to be valuable regardless of where you are in progression.<br />
<br />
The thing we didn’t like about item upgrades previously was that it created these rather brutal decisions where you were essentially betting against yourself, or having to offload large sums of Valor to keep from capping. If you just got a belt, but next week you’re going up against a Heroic boss that drops a best-in-slot belt for you, you might bet that you’ll get that belt and so you’d wait to upgrade it. But that’s complicated by the issue of being Valor capped and needing to spend some. So you dump Valor on upgrading a different slot and just hope you don’t replace that one instead.<br />
<br />
In 5.3 the costs are dramatically cut to the point that these decisions are far less brutal, and you can pretty easily upgrade every slot instead of hedging bets against specific slots being replaced or not. In the example above you could go ahead and fully upgrade that new belt for only 500 Valor, as opposed to the 1500 it would have cost you before.<br />
<br />
PvP Item Upgrades in 5.3:<br />
<br />
Malevolent Gladiator’s Conquest (Season 12) items that have upgrades available are still upgradable at their original costs.<br />
Dreadful Gladiator’s Honor (Season 12) items that have upgrades available are still upgradable at their original costs.<br />
No other PvP items are upgradable, and no new PvP items for the foreseeable future will use the upgrade system.<br />
<br />
<br />
It shouldn’t be too surprising, given that we’ve already come out and said it some weeks ago, that item upgrades are essentially not coming back for PvP. It’s something a lot of PvPers asked that we remove, it’s something we didn’t feel worked out too well, and so unsurprisingly the result is that it isn’t coming back. We’re still probably going to allow the Season 12 items that had previous upgradability to remain upgradable, as noted in the bullets above, but it’s not something we’re absolutely certain about at this moment. We’ll let you know if that changes.<br />
<br />
Because gearing in PvP is based almost entirely on currency purchases, Conquest and Honor already always have a use, and we ask players to amass a lot of them to continue gearing. Honestly it was fairly unanimous that balancing the means of gear acquisition against upgrades just didn’t make good sense, at least with the current systems.<br />

Definitely a move to the right direction.<br />

You get 4-600 (including guild bonuses) per 5 man heroic since 5.2.<br />

Being this system won't be available for pvp gear, that's great. Couple that with the cost reduction (so that you can fully upgrade 2 items a week)...smart decisions by Blizz, IMO.</div></div><hr />

It's like people can't do basic math on how to add up to 1000 or something or they just want any excuse to toss out the empty &quot;Oh sucks I'm quitting&quot; platitudes.<br />
<br />
5.0 LFR == 450 VP for all 5 sections. 5.2 LFR == 180 VP for the two available sections. And that's assuming you don't re-run any section for an extra 45 VP per.<br />
<br />
So, just doing LFR alone and nothing else, that is 630/1000 towards weekly cap [i]from LFR alone. That doesn't even include the VP you get from running normal/heroic bosses. You can cap your 1000 doing only raid content.<br />
<br />
In other words, no one is forcing your to run dailies/5 mans.</div></div><hr />

funny, the same math-impaired people who complained about ´mandatory dailies´ in 5.0 are back complaining about mandatory dailies now. You have to really be bad at math if you think dailies even come close to being ´mandatory´ in order to cap VP every week, especially since he said ´to be a competitive raider´..<br />

<br />
Yep, the next patch ´should´be coming 2 months after 5.2 they even hinted that it was on schedule last week when one of the devs said it would be here sooner than anyone is expecting. But to be fair. patch 5.3 is not going to have a raid, and will not have heroic dungeons.. which leaves basically scenarios and daily quests as the meat..</div></div><hr />

<br />
It was oddly worded, but you use JP to upgrade 463's from 5-mans. So basically 1/2 the amount of JP from 5.1 to upgrade a blue piece, 1/3 the amount of VP from 5.1 to upgrade an epic piece.<br />

Probably won't mean much to your main if they are well geared, but might matter a bit for alts you just dinged and are gearing.</div></div><hr />

The biggest problem with that is at least to some degree fights or specs will be balanced around having fully upgraded gear. Many ppl will say you don't or shouldn't have to upgrade you stuff and in the past that would have been true. As the game moves forward and we have access to this new tool the game patches, nerfs and buffs will be done with the gear upgrading in mind.</div></div><hr />

This notion is just so much bullshit yet it gets trotted out far too often.<br />
<br />
If people managed to eek their way through heroic ToT for the full duration of 5.2 (~2 months or so), then they have already proven they don't need to upgrade their shit.<br />
<br />
Moreover, but the cost is fully one third of the cost from 5.1, so just the VP they already get from clearing their heroic raid would suffice to upgrade at least one piece a week.<br />
<br />
In other words, if heroic raiders are too good to mingle with the unwashed masses, they don't have to, so the persecuted act doesn't work. :rolleyes:<br />

Guess this is better but they still need to give HC raiders more valor, having to run daliy dungeons when you are farming everything on HC just to get fully upgraded is so stupid.<br />
<br />
Heroic raiders farming everything on HC don't need to upgrade anything because they are already farming everything. :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
But, hey, don't let that stop anyone from putting themselves up on some kind of imaginary cross and pretending they are suffering undo hardships.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Definitely a move to the right direction.<br />
<br />
Btw looks like they removed the official post about it, it gives a 404 error atm.Nope the site is working. Just went there.<br />
<br />
This system should not have been removed but it did need some tweaks. No one is forcing you to cap valor. You do not &quot;have&quot; to do this. Is it good for you and your guild? Yes.... but do you 'have&quot; to do it? No... you will get enough valor to upgrade without &quot;having&quot; to max every week...<br />

And heroic raiders get back to doing 5mans and lfr. Fantastic.No, you do not &quot;have&quot; to do anything. You should get more then enough valor per week to upgrade your gear. You can only earn 1000/week and it costs 750. So sure you can have 250 left over each week but no one is forcing you to do 5 mans or lfr. Any serious raider though will not look at this as a chore. All you need to do is get a few guildies, jump in an LFR, and you are pretty much done. You make it seem like it is going to be the end of your life having to maybe run 1 silly LFR a week.<br />
<br />
When I use to raid I was running every LFR, and raiding heroics on my main and 2 alts. During Cata my DK and Pally both had full heroic tank gear. I also ran both 10 man and 25 man during WotLK on a main and an alt. If raiding is a chore for you to log in and do a little extra a week, then I do not see how you are raiding heroics :p</div></div><hr />

It only costs 500 VP to fully upgrade an epic. The 750 is only for JP upgrades (463's from 5-mans). If you cap your 1000 per week, you can upgrade two epics a week. If you do a full clear of your normal/heroic raid for the week and nothing more, you can basically upgrade 1 piece per week, but then if you're getting more than 1 drop upgrade a week that you feel you need to upgrade, shit, you're already greatly surpassed the meager 8 iLvL the 500VP would have even given you.</div></div><hr />

Yes you do, turn it into Cata mats and sell on the AH.<br />
<br />
who would waste honor on mats for a previous expansion, getting honor is a grind and all those cataclysm mats for honor are pathetically low price on AH, not worth wasting your money on best thing you can do with honor is maybe buy a transmog pvp set from honor vendors in dalaran</div></div><hr />

But.. WHY?!<br />
<br />
I thought the whole goddamn point of the MoP Valor revamp was to keep that crap OUT of the main progression for raiders.<br />
VP should be for days when RNG totally hates you and not mandatory farming &quot;content&quot; to stay competitive.<br />
<br />
I'm a raider. I raid. I don't want a stupid currency I have to cap. <br />
Well, at least I can enjoy the silence in 5.2, since VP Items are utter crap for shadow priests. Take you time 5.3... take all the time you need.</div></div><hr />

So basically 1/2 the amount of JP from 5.1 to upgrade a blue piece, 1/3 the amount of VP from 5.1 to upgrade an epic piece.<br />
<br />
Probably won't mean much to your main if they are well geared, but might matter a bit for alts you just dinged and are gearing.<br />
<br />
Yeah, although trading JP for HP and getting PvP gear might still be a better return, given how random dungeon gear can be.<br />
<br />
Edit: I am happy Upgrades will be returning. For people like me who only do LFR, Shado-Pan Assault gear is BiS and my main should have it all by then. It will give me something to burn VP on.</div></div><hr />

Do LFR and if you don't want to do LFR for the newer raids due to not wanting to do the same bosses again, T14 offers 450vp for doing all the raids. You never mentioned scenarios, that is 40 right there, so that is 490 vp. You talk about raiding so I have no idea how good your guild is, but lets say you took 7 current tier bosses down that is 175vp and you are 625vp. If your guild still does MSV that is even more vp. If they don't, you have a choice, run LFR and scenarios over and over again since you don't like 5mans or dailies or do some 5 mans and dailies. You don't need to do 5ms and dailies every single day to cap. You can switch it up one day dailies, one day a 5m instance. Is it that PAINFUL that HORRIBLE to do a 3-4 5m dungeons a week and on other days do dailies?</div></div><hr />

&quot;Forced&quot; to earn VP by doing raids so you can keep you gear competitive for doing. ahem,raids. You're right that you should quit if you feel forced doing the content that you would be doing.</div></div><hr />

If you capped from raiding it wouldnt be an issue, but you dont even get halfway to cap right now. Its a terrible system that forces you to do dungeons/lfr/dailies to cap. They need to make it so you cap valor for clearing the current raid.</div></div><hr />

You can almost half your cap by doing last tier's LFR. I'm not suggesting that it's an ideal solution, but for someone who likes raiding to moan about being forced to do dungeons and dailys it strikes me as disingenuous that it wouldn't at least explore these options before the dreaded daily quest options. Challenge dungeons with a few guildies earn quite a good rate of VP, and okay so they are still technically dungeons but at least they are with guildies instead of randoms. of all things to complain about in this xpac, and there are a few, VP acquisition is not one of them in my book. The whole upgrade thing as a concept, now that's a different matter but enough people seem to like it for Blizzard to bring it back so meh.</div></div><hr />

Easiest version:<br />
<br />
Raid<br />
Faceroll a normal 5man for 80VP/day<br />
Do dailies for your charms.<br />
<br />
Depending on progress you might need a few additional points, I recommend Mogu shan LFR. These are relatively quick and worry free.</div></div><hr />

My only real worry that remains regarding the upgrade system is that the (upgraded) items from the previous patch potentially remains BiS, yet can't be gotten anymore, once the next content patch hits (e.g. some 2/2 sets and trinkets from t14) if it's removed. Hopefully blizzard keeps this in mind for 5.4, possibly by allowing the previous tiers items to remain upgradable?</div></div><hr />
