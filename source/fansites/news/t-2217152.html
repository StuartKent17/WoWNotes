Spring Balloon Festival<br />
Spring Balloon Festival (http://www.wowdb.com/world-events/645-spring-balloon-festival) allows players to take a short balloon ride around a zone.<br />
<br />
<br />
Head to one of the red X markers on the world map to find a balloon.<br />
Once there, speak to the pilot and he will let you sign up to ride.<br />
Actually taking a ride requires a total of three players, so you will have to wait for more players to show up.<br />
The ride will take you elsewhere in the zone and play some dialogue along the way.<br />
You may learn useful things such as the traditional greeting in Suramar city (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2017/may/HidingASurprise.jpg): <br />
At the end of the ride you are dropped off and the balloon disappears. <br />
<br />

Upcoming Mythic Keystone Changes<br />
Patch 7.2.5 is making some changes to Mythic Keystone dungeons (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/6592-Upcoming-Mythic-Keystone-Changes).<br />
One additional change we're making that should hit in the next PTR build, with the goal of providing some extra incentive to run difficulties past the item level cap.<br />
<br />
For every Keystone level above 15, you'll have an increasing chance for the final chest to contain additional loot. This chance scales linearly, will roll over past 100%, and accumulates pretty quickly: at level 20, you'll be guaranteed 4 pieces of loot, plus a 5th if you beat the timer.<br />
<br />
<br />
Patch 7.2.5 PTR - Build 24076 Armor Sets<br />
The PTR build last night added some new Chromie themed armor sets.<br />
<br />

Windwalker T20 4pc Bug<br />
Seems to me when you crit with RSK the timer on FoF is not dropping at all. I've stared at the cd timer during sessions with the practice dummies and not once did I see the numbers skip down 2 secs. I even had the combat log opened to see if I was critting with RSK. <br />
This is fixed in a future build, thanks for the report. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/1061095-windwalker-t20-4pc-not-working/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20755025315?page=1#2))<br />

Yup, the entire world should be a bland featureless expanse. All that effort they spend making those mountains and rivers and trees, the weather effects, random NPCs that run around just populating the world without giving any quests or achievements. None of these things provide any reward so why waste time on it!<br />
<br />
Look at the Rift of Aln for the perfect game environment. A featureless characterless void with nothing to distract you from the boss and the loot. No wonder it shot so quickly to be everyones favourite raid environment! If only the whole game world was the same.</div></div><hr />

Another way to deal with this is to keep the loot amounts as they are now, but scale the loot item level with the lowest geared player in the group. If you're low level and being boosted, great. If you're high level and boosting, not so great, but boosts is for bossts, not for gear. For normal non-boost runs it will force high geared people out of low level mythic+ runs.</div></div><hr />

Lul, with gear from ToS you will probably stomp mythic +15 while being a mindless drone. Even now 12-13 isn't rocket science with gear from HC.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Boosting will be a thing of the past after these changes anyway. Why would you boost anyone when you have unlimited keys in your own group? I actually think this is an amazing change, that finally makes pushing higher keys worth more than just bragging rights.<br />
<br />
Problem is: As long as it still is more efficient to do one run at max loot level in the least amount of time (15 by then will be loot max, and should be doable in 20 minutes, while a 20 would probably take the full 35-40 minutes depending on dungeon), people will still be farming lower keys. 2 20-minute 15+ key runs still result in more gear overall than 1 40 minute 20+ key run.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Rift of Aln is far from perfection. If you look up, you will see completely pointless roots of some tree (don't know which one, I'm no expert of lore). <br />
<br />
Also, they wasting time creating textures for bosses. And why they even name it? It should be just cubic box (like from glory alpha times) named Tier1-Boss7 instead of some Xavias (again, no expert of lore). It will be dead anyway, and I'm not, I should get all this shiny texture and cool names.</div></div><hr />

I do not like Mythic + what ever number they want to put on there and they need to wrangle in 50 sets of the same armor with different ilvls. Makes it easier to balance the game and you know when you get said gear you know it is the best in slot. Get tired of running so many Mythic's and hope you get the right gear. In the next Xpack</div></div><hr />

... Meanwhile Legion showers people in more rewards than any previous iteration of the game from all kinds of activities. And speaking of, there's more actual content in Legion than in previous expansions, and it's not even over yet. <br />
<br />
And you're bitching about not getting a reward from the one thing they specifically said was made with the INTENT of providing something to do which wouldn't make people feel that they had to login or miss out...<br />
<br />
That's just fucking sad as hell.</div></div><hr />

Legion has less content than Wod. You can add 90% more content but if you remove offspecs, alt play, character development - it is still less than original. Loading screen stuck - is not content. And if you happen to dislike this major &quot;feature&quot; mythic+ (because you play wrong class or don't have time to search group for hours) then there isn't even nothing to do.<br />
Example: Having 10000 more items in database (various AP tokens) what makes game slow (instead using AP currency, some shards or whatnot) is not more content - it's less content, because playability suffers.</div></div><hr />

Haha, I've seen it all now.<br />
<br />
Stop doing what you're doing people, this dude says Legion doesn't have the content you're all being busy with. :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
No, Legion does not have less content than WoD. What a fucking retarded statement. The base patch of Legion had more content to it than the entirety of WoD did with WQ's, Quest content, Suramar, Professions, Dungeons etc etc.</div></div><hr />

I know human beings are capable of saying some stupid crap, but this takes the take. It truly does. I never knew there would be anyone out there dumb enough to claim WoD had more content. Sure. Because a major patch that gave a selfie camera and twitter integration was worthwhile... <br />
<br />
Content is quite literally pouring out TWICE AS FAST as it did in WoD.<br />

Because EVERYTHING needs to dangle a carrot before you face to make it worthwhile, amirite? Don't be stupid. Don't get butthurt because you get no rewards from an entirely optional balloon ride event.</div></div><hr />

you can watch paint dry and say it is content. no point to explain to fanboys.<br />

what is exactly pouring to you? balloon ride what drops you off after 10 seconds with loading screen (because apparently game servers couldn't handle it)?<br />
i'll try once more: if im fixed with 1 char and one spec, i call it less content than doing various activities with lots of classes and specs and enjoing game more (altho there is maybe less tedious content overall - game has more activity if i raid with mage, druid and priest vs. i play only 1 spec because AP grind and leges).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Legion's amount of content is an objective fact.<br />
<br />
You not wanting to do it yet being pathetic enough to stick around =/= It not being there for those that WANT to play. :) No point explaining to mindless haters though, you people never seem capable of moving on for some reason. Lack of willpower perhaps...</div></div><hr />

If you are out of arguments then you go personal. Your &quot;fact&quot; is subjective. Non-interesting content isn't content for me. I'm talking about quality not quantity. Maybe you lack willpower to see that WQ are very similar to Tanaan Jungle grind. Legion is just bloated Wod with lots of removed content (what made game fun).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Again, you not having interest in the content =/= it not being there.<br />
<br />
Legion has the most amount of content even at halfway through than any previous expansion. This is a fact no matter how little YOU want to play said content. There's nothing subjective about it, it's on paper. <br />
<br />
I guess I should feel grateful that I lack the capacity for the mental gymnastics required in order to believe that Legion is anything like WoD. Content from the base patch, content releases, pacing, variety of content. All things vastly different. &quot;But I dun liek it so it's just like WoD hurr!!&quot;... Yeah no, doesn't work like that.<br />
<br />
I played all through WoD, and Legion is nothing like it. The WQ system is nothing like Tanaan Jungle. The word &quot;grind&quot; has become a replacement word for &quot;shit I dun want to do QQ!!&quot; thrown by ignorant people whom wouldn't know a proper grind if it hit them in the dick.<br />
<br />
Don't want to do it? Then don't. Meanwhile the rest of us will be busy doing the content that apparently doesn't exist. :rolleyes:<br />

More re-used armour. Fucks sake, wish they'd pack it in.<br />
<br />
I really hope they don't expect those sets to be acceptable as some sort of reward.<br />
<br />
Not only are they recolors, they're recolors of armor sets that very few ever considered to be good looking. :p</div></div><hr />
