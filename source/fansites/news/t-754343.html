Exciting talent trees so far<br />
There was another thread on this topic that kind of turned into the &quot;DK neglect&quot; thread, so I thought I would start a new one on the original topic.<br />
<br />
We're interested in opinions on which current Cataclysm talent trees you find the most exciting.<br />
<br />
Ground rules:<br />
<br />
1) It isn't of much use to us if you like a talent tree because of one particular ability. That tells us little about the talent tree as a whole.<br />
<br />
2) Likewise, your opinion won't count as much (in our minds anyway) if you like a talent tree just because it has all the talents you wish *your* class had. In that same vein, this is probably one case where you're more objective when you find that you like your own talent tree rather than just being all wistful about someone else's toys.<br />
<br />
3) Please try and stick to the talent trees themselves and not use this thread for your laundry list of ideas to improve your class.<br />
<br />
4) Brevity is the soul of wit.<br />
<br />
Another way to think about this: Which classes benefited the most (in the sense of coolness, not necessarily raw power) from the talent overhaul?<br />
<br />
[...]<br />
<br />
Is it equally valid to discuss the opposite of this? As in, what talent trees you feel haven't really been changed at all, or received close to no benefit really of the overall as it's been so far? <br />
The feedback is useful to a degree. The problem is it's really common to see something like &quot;I'm disappointed with my tree. All the other class got a lot of amazing toys and new talents that I really think should be in my tree. All the other classes are incredibly excited about Cataclysm, while the people who play my class are all drunk in the gutter with despair. My tree has changed the least of all the trees and will clearly be terrible in Cataclysm.&quot; That kind of thing tends to be a cross between the grass is greener mentality and just campaigning for buffs. If you think you can be really objective about it, then go ahead, but my concern was that we'd get a lot of &quot;My tree is the worst&quot; feedback, which isn't useful when everyone says that about their tree. Ultimately, it's easier for us to make changes when we know what excites you rather than knowing that you want to be buffed (because we can pretty much assume the latter). <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Blue Posts<br />
<br />
Dispellable Buffs<br />
Many buffs can be dispelled because they are magical effects and because it's strategic to do so. Some buffs can't be dispelled either because it doesn't make sense, because the class couldn't function without the buff, or both. Slice and Dice can't be dispelled, but Savage Roar and Inquisition can be. We might decide to make or all or none of them dispellable. We really need to see more end-game PvP to make that determination. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26560765833/list-of-simple-feral-questions-concerns/))<br />
<br />
Reforging useful stats<br />
It's a matter of degree. Some players will reforge for a sub 1% dps gain, and that's their prerogative. We don't think the stats need to be that close, but they need to be somewhat close. If Ret paladins perfer crit to haste (or Enhacement prefer haste to mastery, etc. etc.) then that's okay so long as crit doesn't provide twice the dps per stat point as haste. If you're willing to take a previous tier's gear because the stat budget is more optimal, then we've got a problem, as we had a few times in the LK content. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26560569575/ret-amp-haste-needs-reworking-causes-quot-hardcap-quot/))<br />
<br />
Breaking crowd controls with melee AE<br />
This is a consideration for many players though. A Prot warrior can't just merrily Thunder Clap no matter what -- they have to evaluate their surroundings, decide if it's appropriate to move slightly farther away, or if they just need to forgo their AE attack for the time being. If Crusader Strike constantly cleaved everything, then that would be really annoying. Having to sometimes drop a 15 sec cooldown ability out of your rotation (assuming you can't move or anything) shouldn't be that big a deal. There are no fights that I can remember off the top of my head where you need to keep a target CC'd in the middle of the melee for long periods of time, and if there are any, they are fairly rare. You should be thankful for the opportunity to sometimes respond to your surroundings by doing different things rather than always mashing the same buttons like you are dashing out a song on a piano. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26560569575/ret-amp-haste-needs-reworking-causes-quot-hardcap-quot/))<br />
<br />
Class Roles<br />
You guys worry way too much about what buckets you're supposed to be in. It seems every time I come to the forums, I am asked to define someone's role. :)<br />
<br />
In PvE, the only roles are tank, dps and healing. In PvP, the only roles are dps and healing (except for very specific circumstances like tanking Drek in AV). Situationally you might be called upon to carry a flag or defend a tower, but that's what you're doing at the moment, not what your talent spec is all about. There are 30 talent trees. They're all a little different. PvP doesn't have positions like quarterback, grenadier, left fielder, drum major or striker. Use all of the abilities you have in order to support your allies and be successful. If you're a Ret paladin, you should focus on melee dps, because that's where your strongest abilities lie.<br />
<br />
Sometimes when I do try and explain how we think a spec should work, I often regret it. I'll say something like how Ret is supposed to be a melee dps class, and keep getting asked &quot;Then why do we have heals?&quot; or &quot;Why should someone take me over a rogue if I'm just melee?&quot; Trying too hard to label things is always going to result in a simplistic answer.<br />
<br />
I'm not trying to dismiss the question. It's just not the way we think about things. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26560500364/retribution-what-are-we-supposed-to-be/))<br />

Death Knights neglected in Cata?<br />
&quot;Neglect&quot; is one of those words that typically makes developers roll their eyes and skip over to the next post. Just so you know. :)<br />
<br />
Even the original DK trees are not very old compared to all the others, so in that sense, they didn't have so many layers of build up cruft that needed shaking off. We've changed up some of the mechanics that weren't working and got rid of some of the boring passive damage, but overall we didn't feel the need to replace talents like say Rime, Dirge or Killing Machine.<br />
<br />
I'm just saying that it shouldn't come as much surprise that the most recently designed tree didn't need as much overhauling as say warrior and mage, which hadn't changed much since vanilla. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26560769922/cata-poll-best-built-talents-trees-so-far/))<br />

Can't use Shred on unusual raid encounters (Kologarn)<br />
When we make an entire instance full of Kologarns then it will be a problem. I think you'll be fine if you can't manage maximum dps on every raid boss. I think the game loses far more when we can't make original bosses with unusual mechanics that we gain by having every dps spec do about the same relative damage on every fight. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26560765833/list-of-simple-feral-questions-concerns/))<br />
<br />
Shred position prereq<br />
PvP is rarely ever decided by someone's long term sustained dps though. It has a lot more to do with making the right decision at the right time.<br />
<br />
In PvE there is no question that Shred is superior, but in most fights you can Shred. Those few fights where you can't Shred aren't ubiquitous enough to feel like a big deal. If you just find it too difficult to always get behind a creature to be able to Shred, then I'm not sure what to tell you. We don't think this problem is so widespread that Ferals are at a huge disadvantage overall. We agree that Feral has a really high skill cap in Lich King, but that's more do to the John Madden nature of the rotation than to Shred's positional requirement, and it's also something we've taken steps to improve in Cataclysm.<br />
<br />
Many specs can't perform their highest 100% potential when mobs are moving or when they have to step out of the fire, but we aren't about to change those in order to make things easier on the player. I think raiding is plenty easy to be honest, unless you're talking about the more challenging heroic-mode encounters in which, yeah, we're asking you to step it up a little. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26560765833/list-of-simple-feral-questions-concerns/))<br />
<br />
Innervate<br />
Innervate is now based on YOUR mana, not the target's mana. GC specifically stated this makes Innervate useless for Ferals, as they do not want Ferals helping Healers in their mana management. <br />
That's not actually what I said. I said that we wanted Feral's Innervate to be less powerful than Balance and Restoration, because we don't want &quot;stack Ferals&quot; to be the solution for healers who overheal a lot. Your Innervate will still be valued (probably more valued, all things considered), but it won't be and shouldn't be the magic pill that gets you a raid slot.

Seal Damage<br />
There's no evidence of that though. You're just fretting. We nerfed Seal damage recently because Ret paladins were beating everyone on damage meters. We aren't spending much effort on numbers yet, but we need them to be reasonable enough so that playtesters don't do unusual things that they wouldn't do when the numbers are tuned more accurately. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26560569575/ret-amp-haste-needs-reworking-causes-quot-hardcap-quot/))<br />
<br />
Holy Power on white attacks?<br />
Holy Power on white attacks was too unpredictable to the point of annoying. Imagine you have 2 Holy Power, start to push Crusader Strike and then at that instant get a white attack proc. Now you have wasted your 1.5 sec GCD *and* wasted Holy Power because you're technically at 4 now. Having Holy Power tied to yellow attacks is at least the kind of thing you can train yourself to watch out for. If you aren't hitting any buttons, then you aren't going to get Holy Power for example. You can notice after every button mash if you got that extra proc or not -- they aren't just happening out of the blue. <br />
<br />
Stacking haste for fast Templar Verdicts<br />
If hitting TV after 23 seconds qualifies as burst, then I think we'll be fine. Yes, once in awhile a Ret might get off a 32K Templar's Verdict, but that's not going to global anyone. <br />
<br />
[...] Haste for most melee grants them more resources. Ret still isn't super dependent on mana though. It will be limiting enough that you can't spam heals or expensive spells like Consecrate, but it won't be so attractive that if we incorporated a haste to mana mechanic that it would at all be attractive.<br />
<br />
Haste for casters makes their spells cast faster, but again you're doing so little of that that it won't be something you really need.<br />
<br />
So neither of those mechanics works for Ret paladins. You'll get more damage from autoattacks of course, but so do the other melee. Tying haste to Crusader Strike cooldown is more consistent with the &quot;haste lets you do more&quot; model for the other melee. (There are no general mechanics that let haste lower the cooldown of something, so you're technically inaccurate in that sense.)<br />
<br />
Finally, we could have just made the haste affects Crusader Strike cooldown a core mechanic. We made it a talent because we found in playtesting that some players liked CS at a predictable 4.5 sec cooldown and others appreciated having the cooldown come faster with haste. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26560569575/ret-amp-haste-needs-reworking-causes-quot-hardcap-quot/))<br />
<br />
Interesting Rotations<br />
&quot;Interesting&quot; is in the eye of the beholder, so that's sort of a hard point to argue. We do think it's more complex though. Part of the problem is it's rather difficult for anyone to screw up the Ret rotation on live. If you hit things when they come off cooldown, you'll do pretty competitive damage. You have no resource to worry about and it's pretty hard to throw your rotation off for very long.<br />
<br />
The change to Holy Power and adding spells like Inquisition and Zealotry means there is a lot more to juggle. If you let Inquisition fall or you aren't prepared to maximize Zealotry uptime, then you aren't playing to your full potential. If you don't hit TV when you get 3 Holy Power, or if you religiously hit TV but eclipse buttons like Judgement in the meantime, then you're not playing optimally.<br />
<br />
Basically we are now engineering opportunities for players to make a mistake. If nobody can make a mistake, then there really is no test of skill and no opportunity for anyone to get better. That's the &quot;faceroll&quot; rep that the tree sometimes gets saddled with -- no matter what you do, you'll end up doing high damage. In Cataclysm, that won't be the case.<br />
<br />
If you find you can master the new rotation trivially, then congratulations, you'll be one of the better paladins out there. I am very confident however that not everyone will be able to do so, and so Ret paladins who do a lot of damage will get more respect for being good players than for having picked the right class on the character select screen. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26560569575/ret-amp-haste-needs-reworking-causes-quot-hardcap-quot/))<br />
<br />
Retribution Rotation<br />
Imagine you did nothing but Crusader Strike and Templar's Verdict. With no haste, you can do a Templar's Verdict every 13.5 seconds. With enough haste to lower Crusader Strike to 4.4 seconds, you can do a Templar's Verdict every 13.2 seconds. In the space in between Crusader Strikes you will be able to Judge and use Holy Wrath and sometimes get Exorcism procs. You might also use free cycles for utility abilities depending on the situation. But your rotation should never be so full that every Crusader Strike must land every 4.5 sec or its wasted. It might be wasted sometimes, but not so often that Sanctity of Battle is an unattractive talent.

Like Snozberries, I did that math quickly so I may have screwed up somewhere, but assuming I did not, your hardest hitting ability is available 0.6 sec earlier. Not a huge dps increase overtime, but probably comparable to an equivalent amount of crit rating (given that this is not the only haste benefit).

Healthstones are good and good players use them. If bad players continue to ignore Lightwell, we can live with that. If it becomes as useful as a Healthstone, perfect.<br />

Also note that ignoring a Healthstone (or Lightwell) will be essentially like casting a mana drain on your healer, which is not the case today. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26560537380/lightwell-changes-build-12803/))<br />

<br />
Before flaming and raging you could actually click on the source thing.<br />
Retridins provided the rotation and showed how haste would hardly increase the dps from CS.<br />
GC replied by making his own rotation, saying that it will be more likely to go like this and that haste WILL provide a good increase on CD dps.<br />
<br />
This all comes down to a talent that paladins have: It reduced the cooldown of CS based on haste.<br />
The big objection to this was that people saw our rotation as:<br />
CS - Filler - Filler - CS - Filler - Filler - repeat<br />
<br />
In that rotation the cooldown reduction would be useless, but GC pointed out that it wouldn't be the case.<br />
<br />
So no, we are not retards.</div></div><hr />

So lame. The WoW forums (in English) should just be joint for EU and US. All EU has is CMs with no power over anything making &quot;fresh announcements&quot; about 3 hours after Boub has posted it on MMOC.<br />
<br />
-<br />
<br />
I say this because I want to give my opinion on how lame Assassination tree is looking. Pretty much nothing is changing with the playstyle at all besides throwing a Rupture in (which we did in Ulduar with 4set anyway).<br />
<br />
Mutilate to 4-5 CP &gt; Rupture &gt; Mutilate to 4-5 CP &gt; Envenom &gt; *do just Envenom for 18 seconds* &gt; Mutilate to 4-5 CP &gt; Rupture<br />
<br />
So in-depth and diverse. It's not like I was doing this in Ulduar and half of ToC with 4set T8 at all. No sir. <br />
<br />
And Vendetta, so interesting. It's totally not the exact same as Hunger for Blood but on a cooldown with PvP gimmick. Sure you can time this to coincide with Bloodlust for extra damage but to time it right you either need to lose uptime waiting for Bloodlust at a specific percentage or you can be clairvoyant and know exactly when Bloodlust will be used.<br />
<br />
I've already swapped to Combat after playing only Assassination from level 10 to 80 to ICC. Tree that should be exciting is just it's same boring self since ToC patch with little or no choice in filler talents depending on how Murderous Intent works out.<br />
<br />

Well ok then I apologise, but it really piss me off how much care this class gets when other should get more love than they do... really ? is it really so important to explain people something they will find out in the game than actually make changes for other classes ?

They had a nice post about this, and all the classes get the same treatment.<br />
The development team is making sure that every class feels right in the rotation.<br />
Most classes are fine on wotlk and thus need less changes.<br />
Ret's at the moment are crap, they needed a massive overhaul, that is why they get a lot of changes.<br />
<br />
Nothing is being explained, you should reread my post.. Or I can tell it again.<br />
We have a talent that makes haste effect the cooldown of Crusader Strike.<br />
In the current live version, this would be a ZERO dps increase.. They are discussing how it WILL be an increase in Cataclysm.<br />
<br />
I'm actually jealous on other classes that their talent points are clear on how they help you. And I know other pallies feel the same.<br />
Other classes aren't getting an entire new resource system after five years that is broken and shaky on all sides.<br />
<br />
And to end this post, my mains are a paladin and a hunter.<br />
Even tho hunters get hardly anything, I don't mind.. I rather have them spend more time on retri's then get another 3.0<br />
Is that what you want?</div></div><hr />

In Wotkl Paladin with naxx two handed was doing better dps than arcane mage in t7 (before ulduar) so sorry for me to bee so sceptic about it, and anyway, what other class gets a complete overhaul every expansion ??

Vanilla - Only Holy<br />
TBC - Only Holy, rets and prots were an extreme rare case.<br />
<br />
You cannot say they get a complete overhaul EVERY expansion when it only happened once.<br />
They needed it to make sure that dps and tanking was actually a decent spec, but retridin still isn't decent.<br />
<br />
Other classes get 'less' because you don't have to fix things that aren't broken.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is a difference between &quot;not having their moment&quot; in cata, and being abandoned completely.<br />
<br />
The current Rune System, and Rune Costs on Cooldowns, makes playing a Death Knight tank close to impossible.<br />
<br />
You can essentially only use threat generating abilities ONCE every 10 seconds, and if you DO use that ability... you can't use ANY of your defensive cooldowns.<br />
<br />
That's like saying Warrior Heroic Strike shares a cooldown with Shield Wall &amp; Last Stand.<br />
<br />
It. Is. Retarded.</div></div><hr />

Shred position prereq<br />
PvP is rarely ever decided by someone's long term sustained dps though. It has a lot more to do with making the right decision at the right time.<br />
<br />
In PvE there is no question that Shred is superior, but in most fights you can Shred. Those few fights where you can't Shred aren't ubiquitous enough to feel like a big deal. If you just find it too difficult to always get behind a creature to be able to Shred, then I'm not sure what to tell you. We don't think this problem is so widespread that Ferals are at a huge disadvantage overall. We agree that Feral has a really high skill cap in Lich King, but that's more do to the John Madden nature of the rotation than to Shred's positional requirement, and it's also something we've taken steps to improve in Cataclysm.<br />
<br />
Many specs can't perform their highest 100% potential when mobs are moving or when they have to step out of the fire, but we aren't about to change those in order to make things easier on the player. I think raiding is plenty easy to be honest, unless you're talking about the more challenging heroic-mode encounters in which, yeah, we're asking you to step it up a little. (Source)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
On one hand Cataclysm's talent trees will shrink almost in half giving players actually no choice how to spec within a tree, yet Blizz devs still impose 2 different dps system for Feral Cats. <br />
<br />
One with Mangle, the other with Shred? <br />
<br />
1. There is no other build of any class, who dps solo/leveling &quot;one way&quot; while in raid &quot;the other way&quot; with the same spec. Except for Feral Cats, all other spec in the game, dps with few if any variations,<br />
<br />
2. What a BS lie! For ALL solo PvE content Shred just CANNOT BE USED! Having an special attack, which can be used mostly in raid environment is jut bad for players to learn the spec and class properly. Even in 5m (as all want to breeze through), if tank do not reposition the mobs, Shred just won't be used, ever!<br />
<br />
Shred positional requirement is outdated concept and is annoying in PvE raids, frustrating in PvP/PvE 5m and impossible to use in PvE solo to use!.<br />
<br />
IT NEEDS TO GO (AWAY) period!</div></div><hr />

Fucking paladins got 100% overhauled in WotLK and now they're doing it -AGAIN-. The only difference from my job in WotLK is now I'll have to wait double the time to use an ability because they changed the rune system to meet the standard of mouth-breather Joe and his 3k DPS.</div></div><hr />

Look around, there isn't a single smooth round surface in the game, everything has visible polygon edges. This saves a ton on server load and pc load, having to load so many less polygons everywhere.</div></div><hr />

My ICC-264 geared priest had 35k hp unbuffed the second he logged into the beta. Getting to 50k hp at 85 in blues/greens does not seem unreasonable.</div></div><hr />

Just seems slightly odd to me that a single ability doing like 60% of your health bar (based on your numbers there) in one shot seems to be fine in their minds.<br />
Even if it requires 2 or 3 abilities to land before it, there will be no chance of surviving that afterwards?<br />
If my ret can deal that amount of damage in that time, i fear elemental shaman already lol.<br />
It really baffles me that they say wrath damage is too high, yet seem to continue the trend with that.<br />

The changed multi shot makes me feel much more comfortable as a hunter, though, I can't wait to see what the animation is for it. If it's like FoK, that's not really realistic for a hunter. <br />

And if we are seeing 32k's out of a Paladin spell, imagine what we will see out of Kill Shot, the hardest hit in the game. Even though Kill Shot only works below 20%, it's going to be scary.</div></div><hr />

Right now in beta, my tank is level 83. After replacing nearly my entire set of 251-gear (I only have boots, wrist, and cloak left from WotLK. Oh and weapon.), I have 52k health unbuffed. That's all greens and a blue belt. And no gems or enchants, either- professions are still broke. The 32K crit may also be when EVERYthing is popped, and only at level 85, with max level gear.<br />
<br />
I'm betting that in the first raid instance tanks will be hovering around 75k. If not more... maybe 80k? Most regular folks may be at 50-60k health pools.</div></div><hr />

Hope its their aim for BiS endgame yeah.<br />
I'm hoping we get around 100k average health between classes, with the whole tank health not being much higher than dps in theory (at least thats what im lead to believe?)<br />
<br />
Then those 30k crits would be fine.<br />
But if that isnt the case, the damage problem of wrath wont go away.</div></div><hr />

It will be much higher. You can expect people to have a 55-60k health pool in semi raid gear or less. It's been said by blues that by the time we face Deathwing even healers will have hit the 100k HP mark</div></div><hr />

Druids are &quot;crying&quot; for well over 4 years, yet Blizz just don't listen. Even constructive one got shafted away. &quot;So many issues for Ferals, yet all they do is band-aid over band-aid.

Wording the question that way produces biased results. <br />
<br />
It's like the difference between asking: - &quot;Do you think Sarah Palin is qualified to be President&quot; and &quot;Why Sarah Palin would be a good President&quot;.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Randomly assembling groups would require many additional features, tools and rules that are very tricky to design in order to enforce these things&quot;. <br />
<br />
Wasn't a gear check implemented into BGs an expansion back ;) or doesn't that work, i'm sure it never worked.<br />
<br />
Patch 2.1 - The new battleground matchmaking system is now implemented and active. This system allows the battleground to select teams of similar equipment quality and organizational level to battle each other. For now, the system will be very forgiving about creating matchups in order to keep queue times low. However, the parameters will be adjusted as necessary when more organized teams become active in the battlegrounds. <br />
<br />
i mean his excuse why blizzard doesn't employ PUG rated BGs is simply because they wouldn't know what class roles to put into it. But then, in this instance, turns around and says only 2 are needed DPS and healing. (with maybe a tank for drek). http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26560500364/retribution-what-are-we-supposed-to-be/ <br />
<br />
So technically a rated PUG would go a lot better, since the tank would be defined from the start rather than a PUG where everybody checks what gear they bought and kinda evade the question of &quot;whose going to tank?&quot;. As for 10 man BGs, well if both sides were given 2-3 healers and 7-8 DPS (ie WG and the new BG) then they'd be fair ground, rather than PUGs which you're lucky to see one healer ;) <br />
<br />
The actual ability as we've seen from the Dungeon finder (and blizz have spoken about a raid finder to some degree) would be easy to put into Rated PUG Bgs. <br />
<br />
The real reason is simply Blizzard do not want people to get the best PvP gear (arena) quickly with the rated BGS even though in Vanilla participating in BGs and getting honour WAS the only way to get decent gear. as poorly executed arena combat without spectator mode (unlike guild wars) wasn't implemented then. <br />
<br />
Once that was implemented BGs took a step back, to be honest i didn't see much point in WG except FOR achievement purposes as grinding honour to buy 2nd hand epics was pretty much !@@#. there i said it. <br />
<br />
So blizzard has much to do, rated BGs at the moment are for guilds and elite ------ so it's basically larger based arena combat which will have more problems than solutions. Remember getting a 40 man raid together, imagine doing it for a rated AV. For BOTH sides. AT the same time. <br />
<br />
It's not going to work well, and we still all know the best honour is now WG or AV (unless it's one of the &quot;weekends&quot;). Even then does anybody actually like &quot;EoS&quot;? <br />
<br />
Epic Failure incoming. someone warn blizzard ;)</div></div><hr />

It's really getting ridiculous, when Blizz change something about other classes, no discussion or a small one to show where they stand, when they change something about Paladins they have to apologise and try not to get eaten &gt;.&gt; *sigh*....<br />

Yes! He is one of those nerdy douches who thinks he is funny but isn't... at all. The whole mmo-report is trash. Nothing you can't find out by actually looking. But if people like it, let em waste 8 minutes of their life having some dork tell you shit you probably already know.<br />

There is no other build of any class, who dps solo/leveling &quot;one way&quot; while in raid &quot;the other way&quot; with the same spec. Except for Feral Cats, all other spec in the game, dps with few if any variations,<br />
<br />
That is just not true. Any class that uses DoTs (Moonking, Warlock, Shadow Priests, Rogues, etc) definitely have a much different rotation while soloing than they do in a raid setting. It just isn't worth it to spend your resources on something that is going to provide little return on a 10 second fight. The same is even true for most trash in a 5 man. Even ignoring Mangle/Shred there is no way a Feral Druid is going to put a 5 combo rip on the target. At least on live, I can't speak for Cataclysm with the higher health. Although I can't imagine the mobs lasting long enough for you to even want to spend combo points on a bleed ability.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
2. What a BS lie! For ALL solo PvE content Shred just CANNOT BE USED! Having an special attack, which can be used mostly in raid environment is jut bad for players to learn the spec and class properly. Even in 5m (as all want to breeze through), if tank do not reposition the mobs, Shred just won't be used, ever!<br />
On my Druid I have used Shred following a pounce in solo PVE content. Not something I'd always do though as stealth will slow you down.<br />
<br />
As for the 5 mans, moving behind a mob to shred should not be a big deal. It only becomes an issue if the tank is moving the mobs a lot. But if the tank gets into one position and you can go behind the mob I don't see what the big deal is.</div></div><hr />

How can you nerf both Innervate and Shred and expect the outcome to be anything less than raids not taking feral cats. If your dps sucks and you lose any really unique raid utility no guild is going to give you a raiding spot. They seem to like the idea of all druids being either restoration or balance.<br />
<br />
Also, how can you make it so that a tank can only single target and still allow trash to 1-2 shot players. Its a horrible design. Its bad enough we have to focus on cc, but now tanks have a cool down on their aoe, and it still breaks crowd control, so it will be impossible to use on pull.<br />

<br />
Because battle rez isnt enough? If they had both brez AND a strong innervate raids would just stack feral druids and healers would never go oom.<br />
<br />
I do not know how the numbers pan out in the beta, but I can say that with the strong utility feral already provides, what is going to stop a raid leader from bringing three feral druids instead of three rogues?<br />
<br />
&quot;GUYS, we need more rogues for SMOKE BOMB&quot;<br />
<br />
Right...<br />
<br />
And if you are incapable of standing behind your target in a five man or raid, then you might want to consider going boomkin afterall. <br />
<br />

<br />
It's not a horrible design. It's the BC design that actually required players to make use of their CC and not smash their aoe button every time trash was pulled. Basically, the group has to *gasp* work together to *gasp* coordinate an attack. The tank takes initial threat with his or her aoe ability and every dps focuses on killing ONE target at a time (Kill skull and then x, sheep moon, sap square). I can't even do a heroic anymore because the challenge is being able to stay awake while I spam fan of knives and evasion tank bosses for bad tanks.<br />

Mage(s) poly pulled. Hunter would kite or trap something. Warrior would just demo shout and they all come to him. The just tab target and sunder dps would wait till 3 sunders went up then DPS go!</div></div><hr />

DK neglect - am i the only one laughing. Everytime i see a DK tank, i shudder inwardly (for good reason) and everytime i see a DK i eye roll. Very few good DKs. Less is good. Until another hero class appears. DK had their &quot;moment&quot; with wrath not every expansion can focus on them :P<br />

Or maybe it's a way to try and get the opinion of people who are qualified. They should have thought about that before handing out beta invites to the biggest morons currently playing this game. I have yet to see beta footage made by a player with a minimum of skill. They're all shit and don't understand their classes. I don't see how their feedback can be valuable in any way.</div></div><hr />
