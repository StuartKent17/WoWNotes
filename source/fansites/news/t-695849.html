Class synergy and PvP difficulty<br />
Class synergy matters a lot more in PvP than in PvE. As a very simple example, chaining crowd control with different diminishing returns is almost non-existent in PvE. Therefore, classes with different forms of crowd control play very well together in PvP. To break that (to make class synergy not matter), we'd have to make all CC's DR with each other. I think it would get worse than that though. I think you'd have to give just about every ability to every class for fear that you might be missing one if you just paired with 2 other random players. It takes a whole raid to get almost one of everything in PvE and that's with a lot of homogenization on our part. We like that class comp matters in Arenas. It really doesn't much in BGs.<br />
<br />
I also understand that there is a component of players who liked the aspect of BC Arenas where you could pretty much go in with anything and eventually get good gear. Maybe there is a way to still have a place for that, but we backed off of it because too many players were opting for Arena over PvE content simply because the loot per unit effort was so generous. Adding a skill component to earn the best PvP loot pushed some players back into PvE to earn the best gear. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/23140354302-dks-in-pvp.html))<br />

&quot;Interesting&quot; talents in Cataclysm<br />
Will we keep simple talents that staticly reduce cooldown or cast times?<br />
Will talents that staticly increase walk/run speed by 15% count as interesting?<br />
Will talents that staticly increase or decrease the length of time a dot or hot ticks for count as interesting?<br />
<br />
Yes, all of those are &quot;interesting.&quot; Sure reducing cooldown or cast time is just a dps (or healing) increase, but it does so in a way that requires more on the part of the player than just passively boosting dps (or healing). It changes your rotation depending on whether you have that talent or not. It makes your dps tree play differently from your healing tree.<br />
<br />
Everyone can come up with the example of &quot;I think X talent is really fun, but I only have 2 free points in my build, so I can't get it.&quot; We'd like to see that 2 be a much larger number, like 10 or more.<br />
<br />
Another way to think about it is that every talent in say the Elemental tree also says &quot;...and increases your spell damage.&quot; That's the bonus you get just for investing in the tree.<br />
<br />
Talents are one of the few choices with regard to customizing their character that players really get. Gear is often subject to random elements or even whether you have access to the content or not. Everyone gets the same spells as they level. We can't get away from cookie-cutter builds completely, but we can have more of the type that say &quot;and spend your last several points wherever you want.&quot; (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/23214332010-not-understanding-the-cata-goals-and-ideals.html))<br />

Healing and mana regeneration in Cataclysm<br />
I was about to write what I often do about healer mana management, which is that without mana being a consideration, healing is boring because you can just use your most powerful spell non-stop. Then I read your second paragraph, and it seems like you sort of agree with that. Imagine then that both MP5 and Spirit are going away and being replaced by a new stat called &quot;Regen.&quot; Then imagine that a few weeks down the road, we decided that &quot;Spirit&quot; was a sexier name than &quot;Regen.&quot; (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/23214332010-not-understanding-the-cata-goals-and-ideals.html))<br />

Buffing Owlkin Frenzy?<br />
I don't think Owlkin Frenzy would be a good area to buff Balance burst damage in PvP. It's very dependent on actually being the one focused. That almost by definition is not &quot;on demand.&quot;<br />
<br />
I also don't think it's a great place to buff them for PvE. There are fights without a lot of predictable raid damage, and void zone diving shouldn't be critical in keeping your dps up. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/23214132388-owlkin-frenzy-suggestion.html))<br />

Revenge buff<br />
I suspect we will buff Revenge to make it more attractive to push even in high rage situations. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/23214762315-so-gc-how-about-that-buff-to-revenge.html))<br />

Video - Boom De Yada WoW<br />
Irdeen Productions presents &quot;Boomdeyada&quot;, an original production inspired by the Discovery.com &quot;I Love the Whole World&quot; song. With World of Warcraft's meteoric rise to become the most influential MMO in history, it is only fitting that we showcase some of Azeroth's most powerful beings, from the small Gorlocks to the massive Firelord himself, Ragnaros.<br />
<br />

<br />
On the topic of Cataclysm, I think this clears up very much. I was always a firm believer that talents that, for example, increased running speed or increased the duration of our HoTs/DoTs would stay, but I noticed that a lot of people were thinking otherwise (which really was completely fine, the way it was worded at Blizzcon was a bit confusing). This way we'll see a much lesser overhaul of the talent trees than perhaps originally expected, yet a sizeable change with plenty of possibilities of 'cookie-cutter' spec with chances of personal customization.<br />
<br />
Overall, I think this is a very welcome change that will hopefully lend itself to a more living world with more differences in playstyle.</div></div><hr />

Class synergy matters a lot more in PvP than in PvE. As a very simple example, chaining crowd control with different diminishing returns is almost non-existent in PvE. Therefore, classes with different forms of crowd control play very well together in PvP. To break that (to make class synergy not matter), we'd have to make all CC's DR with each other. I think it would get worse than that though. I think you'd have to give just about every ability to every class for fear that you might be missing one if you just paired with 2 other random players. It takes a whole raid to get almost one of everything in PvE and that's with a lot of homogenization on our part. We like that class comp matters in Arenas. It really doesn't much in BGs.<br />
<br />
<br />
Gief DR on stuns in pvp tbh... I am so fucking sick of rogues just going in and stunlocking you to death.... Even my arena parter, a pally can't do anything.... It really needs some fixing!</div></div><hr />

<br />
MEGABLAST (HIP HOP ON PRECINCT 13) is the name of the song itself.<br />
<br />
the theme you are looking at was ripped from the following movie: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PWyMHLXA7k<br />
<br />
This is the video game it was used in much (almost 20 years) later: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2w-tiRnac2k <br />
<br />
I actually had this videogame myself on one of my old PCs. This song totally made it something special.<br />
<br />
Amusing fact: This was a rap song that went nowhere with the rap version. It was only the instrumental version that did anything on the charts. It's probable that the people who created Xenon 2 had no clue that the song was originally a rap song, or that the theme was ripped from a John Carpenter movie from the 70's.</div></div><hr />

I just have to say that you're really reaching there. You know how many bads have to deal in arena for the same amount of &quot;goods&quot; to get their 2000+ rank?<br />
<br />
For every win that gives you points, you create loses that make others lose points - it's a zero sum system. People are just lucky of late that so many bads are playing, because honestly, as one of those bads, I'm NEVER going to see good arena gear short of buying it up with PVE badges or getting lucky in VOA - and even then I wouldn't have a weapon.<br />
<br />
To the guy getting all uppity about Oxhorn's characters being there: First off, it's HIS VOICE. Second, not only does the creator give him credit as a voice actor, but also thanks him at the end credits.<br />
<br />
Oxhorn worked on the project.<br />
<br />
That being said, Oxhorn moving against this guy on a legal standpoint would be hardpressed to get any money from the creator - especially since no revenue is lost because of the presense of Oxhorn's characters, as it is illegal to make money from fanart in the first place.</div></div><hr />

I suspect we will buff Revenge to make it more attractive to push even in high rage situations.<br />

I read this, and had to check the source. Ghostcrawler, you're a fuckìng scrub - you're idiotically implying that Revenge, in it's current state, is not 'attractive' enough to use when you have an influx of rage. <br />

Alts , &quot;throw away&quot; teams, people who rank up then sell their team mid season and just build themselves right back up. With the right mindset, its simply another grind to the upper tiers. ( And just like PvE, there is &quot;skill&quot; to the super high end )</div></div><hr />

I feel a tiny bit insulted, but not so much that I would rage about it.<br />
<br />
I did 7 voices, actually, not 5:<br />
<br />
- Vrykul<br />
- Sporeling<br />
- Gandling<br />
- Velen<br />
- Forsaken group<br />
- Garrosh<br />
- Troll (The one at the end.)<br />
<br />
You got my sister's voices right, at least (Yes, you heard me.). ;-P Really did some outstanding work, especially since this was her very first voice acting job, that was also made in a really short notice (A few hours before the contest deadline with me telling her what to do. XD) and she is only 16, at the moment.<br />
<br />

<br />
I can also add that this is kind of my 5th project that I have been casted in, so far, and I have been auditioning seriously in like half a year, now. Hehe, didn't expect this movie to get so popular so fast, although I knew it would be awesome. ;-P Glad people seem to like Garrosh and Velen, a lot. ^_^<br />
<br />
Anyway, I want to give my thanks to Irdeen and Matt Greenburg, especially, since they have really helped me a lot with my voices. I really hope we will be able to work together more, in the future. ^_^</div></div><hr />
