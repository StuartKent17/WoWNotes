Coverage will include the StarCraft, Warcraft III and World of Warcraft Arena tournaments, and much more. You will need to download the Octoshape plug-in (http://www.giga.de/2/live/free/) to access the stream.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Open Windows Media Player if you have it and go to &quot;File -&gt; Open URL&quot; and then paste:<br />
http://127.0.0.1:6498/ms/asf/EPGIGA.giga350/Octoshape?MSWMExt=.asf<br />
<br />
That should work. You can probably find a way to record then, but so far the host, Giga, has been doing a horrible job.</div></div><hr />
