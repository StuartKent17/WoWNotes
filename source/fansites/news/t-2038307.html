But we attack the broken shore without demon hunters, hence why they can't do the scenario. Would feel weird to have them around before it. Not to mention the reason why they were allowed in to begin with.</div></div><hr />

The goal is for it to be the second or third best talent in that tier. The team will do another tuning pass to make sure that this is the case.&quot;<br />
<br />
Saying demon Blades is a different playstyle, but you are pressing less buttons is like saying Having no legs is a different way of life, but you have less limbs. It still fucking sucks.</div></div><hr />

There's 3 weeks in which people can play DH and the class doesn't work without all their talents. In fact, it's gonna be near impossible to tank Dungeons at max or while leveling as Vengeance without the entire talent selection, due to so many essencial skills being 106+<br />

<br />
Not to mention both Specs play like ass rotation wise without the full selection.</div></div><hr />

I was wondering the same thing. <br />
<br />
Please remind me, since it has been about 6 years, but with Death Knights, weren't you only able to create one as long as you had at least one level 70 character on your account? You could also make one on multiple servers, however, it was limited to only a single DK per server? It may just be in my head, but I'm pretty sure the two DKs I have on different servers were made at the same time. Correct me if I'm wrong. Thanks.</div></div><hr />

I think the only thing incorrect here is the level, you just had to have a level 58 at the time to create a DK since they started at 58.</div></div><hr />

Originally you had to have a 58 (or whatever it was) ON the server, they then lifted that to account wide but still had the 1 dk per server thing in affect, now its FFA on dks but it took a few years.</div></div><hr />

<br />
OK, thanks for that. For some reason I had 70 in my head as you having to have completed BC, but I guess not.<br />
<br />
This makes me wonder what their logic is on limiting you to only having a DH on a server you already have a 70 on. I was wondering if it was because they were afraid of everyone making one, but that doesn't seem right since, more than likely a vast majority of people created a DK (if even just to try out) when they were added in Wrath.<br />

Sorry to hear that you think rotations are all that makes a player a good player. Your life must be pretty shallow. It's okay, I'm here for support. <br />

It seems odd to even have a level requirement at all now since when you buy legion you get a boosted level 100.</div></div><hr />

This is actually cool to have a date, TY BLIZZARD! Looks like i'll be screwing around with my 5 free day welcome back to FF14...then heading to DIII S7 from the 5th to the 9th.<br />

Next week will 100% have the broken shores scenario since the timeline is where you go and check on your leaders then demons start invading the major cities and that will cause the demon hunters to offer help to the alliance and horde factions after that they will be playable and the invasion will be on a larger scale</div></div><hr />

The only difference is that havoc dh has a &quot;forward&quot; rush without needing a target that he can execute mid-air in addition to double jump and gliding.<br />
<br />
It does not fit in their opinion because flying without a mount is special and it's not that clear a class fantasy that a demon hunter has demon wings he can fly with anytime he wants?<br />
<br />
There are already a few special things about a demon hunter , so it was not necessary to feel more like special snowflakes probably ;)<br />

They also confirmed in the Q&amp;A that DH starting Zone part 2 takes place during the same time frame as the Broken Shore scenario. This is why Khadgar isn't at the Broken Shore, he's getting the DH's from the vault. The only really weird part of the whole thing is they neglected to mention when during the Q&amp;A the actual date of the Broken Shore.<br />

Cross Faction chat will just make social worse. All the kids will be taunting etc. Also Expect &quot;enemy&quot; teams to co-ordinate better for feeding each other. Case in Point in Ashran last week Avengers made a deal with Hydra to farm each other for 15 mins at the GY. First one side would farm then the other. They were feeding each other kills for Achievements. Crack Jack bullshit cheating is pretty much what it is so expect with DH for it to get worse.<br />

Spectral Sight will give a MASSIVE edge to premades. 1 Tank DH and 2 DPS DH to guard the flag in WSG. Means stealth will become useless again. Expect to see a TON of Premade DH to combat stealth issues. Would mean Spectral Sight is up 100%.</div></div><hr />

Illidan's Warglaives will not be modified.<br />
The team has talked about allowing Demon Hunters to use that model somehow in the future. Maybe allowing them to unlock that appearance for transmog.<br />
<br />
Why? If they're gonna do that, can't they just let everyone transmog legendaries like we've been asking for for years? I mean I get why they don't let us do that, but making an exception for *one class* seems super unnecessary.<br />

Communication<br />
Demon Hunters can communicate cross-faction with Demonic.<br />

People like you I hate. Why can't you just accept that not every race should be able to be every class. WoW is MMORPG and with only Nelfs and Belfs being limited to DH fits excellent with the lore and gives some RPG elements back to the game which has nearly vanished over the years.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A visual glyph = Fancy recolor or skill boost at most.<br />
But making &quot;a couple extra animations&quot;? <br />
Sure it could be cool and such a flashy/unique glyph requires effort but do you even know how animation works?<br />
The wings would naturally be placed on their shoulder blades and guess what, your shoulders move when you walk/run!<br />
That means your permanent wings would be floppy as hell and an incredible nuisance for people in raids when a pair of wings block their views, not that some people would lack the consideration to remove the glyph before entering a raid/dungeon.<br />

It's kinda dumb that they hadn't allowed inter-factional communication before, like how could Pandaren or Forsaken possibly offend anyone from the opposite faction more than toxic raid players or just anyone? Jerks are going to exist on both sides and allowing people to cross-faction talk won't increase the number of jerks, the DH language will be really interesting for RP purposes which I look really forward to.</div></div><hr />

But making &quot;a couple extra animations&quot;? <br />
Sure it could be cool and such a flashy/unique glyph requires effort but do you even know how animation works?<br />
The wings would naturally be placed on their shoulder blades and guess what, your shoulders move when you walk/run!<br />
That means your permanent wings would be floppy as hell and an incredible nuisance for people in raids when a pair of wings block their views, not that some people would lack the consideration to remove the glyph before entering a raid/dungeon.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm not an expert on animation but what I do know is that Blizzard is a multi-million dollar company that employs hundreds of people to work on their games. I'm sure there is one company that could have pulled it off and on time it's them. After the mess that was WoD; I expect them to win me back as a customer. Not feed me the same old tired excuses they have been using since Cataclysm.</div></div><hr />

Right, and the level 55 restriction was only removed when they introduced lvl 90 character boosts, and you could make multiple dks on the same server since WOD.</div></div><hr />

whata retarded decisions - DH would be perfect class for easy server rerolling but nooooo you just have to wate time leveling random alt to 70 just to put there DH to play - blizzard being retarded just for sake of being retarded - clearly if some of us leveled 20-30 toons to max is not evnough leveling for easy creation of DH</div></div><hr />

<br />
Being difficult to accomplish is different to not bothering though. By saying<br />
<br />
The goal is for it to be the second or third best talent in that tier.<br />
they are basically saying they know it's bad and you should pick something else but they need 3 per tier so had to stick some shit there to fill the slot. It's just lazy. Everyone knows they'll never get every talent tier for every spec balanced perfectly but to actually plan for certain talents to be 'bad picks' is just poor design.<br />
<br />
In this specific case, they know Demon Blades is crap, they should be tuning it with the goal of it being a viable choice. For some (like me) it'll probably always be ignored simply because it's a playstyle I don't enjoy but for others, there's no reason to not at least try give them that option. purposely tuning to make the talent less viable than the other two just makes it useless for everyone.</div></div><hr />

This actually surprised me a bit. Yes, it's easy to pick up and play, but the mastery curve is huge. At least from what I've seen on beta anyway.<br />

If they made Demon Blades even remotely good, they will get flak from the players that want more buttons. The community is especially sensitive about that now because of the ability prune. This is why they quickly nerfed the talent a couple weeks ago when it was over performing.</div></div><hr />

the talent makes your rotation easier to pull off at the cost of dps loss. sounds like a fair trade to me, and as they mentioned in the interview, for most people it will be actually dps increase.</div></div><hr />

Somone actually said we will be doing broken shore while demon hunters are doing their starting area, so I could be wrong. I could have sworn that they said the broken shore would be the LAST thing we do tho. Who knowsl? lol<br />

But we attack the broken shore without demon hunters, hence why they can't do the scenario. Would feel weird to have them around before it. Not to mention the reason why they were allowed in to begin with.<br />
<br />
Yeah, you're right. I just swore I heard the devs say before that it would be the LAST thing we do AFTER demon invasions. Maybe they weren't planning on releasing demon hunters at the same time as the demon invasion. who knows? lol</div></div><hr />

At least they don't force you to go through WoD content as DH before joining the battle against the Legion, like they did with DKs. Instead of going to Northrend and fight LK, you've just escaped from his control after all, you have to go through Outland first. <br />

The guy said something like &quot;unfortunately there always will be a skill gap&quot;. That tells a lot about their design philosophy. Im not saying its necessarily bad, in the game you depend on a lot of random guys to succeed in a lot of cases, it might not be terrible to have a high chance of the guy next to you being able to handle their 2-3 spell dps rotation and the one or two utility spell they have.</div></div><hr />

you have to know where you will end up after proccing it and if that will be bad for you/raid. Proccing at the right time to maximise use. Maximising uptime. That requires knowing your class, knowing the surrounding area, and knowing boss mechanics before doing it.<br />
<br />
that is a LOT more then is required for most classes to do good DPS on a boss. Most classes all you need to know is your spec rotation.</div></div><hr />
