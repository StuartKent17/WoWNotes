Breath of the Black Prince<br />
To go along with the new The Black Prince faction there are some quests that end with the reward of a legendary item, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wowdb.com/items/87212-breath-of-the-black-prince&quot; class=&quot;wow-item wow-item-q5 item5&quot;&gt;Breath of the Black Prince&lt;/a&gt;! This item is likely used to upgrade your gear in some way. Before helping Wrathion, you first share a drink with him (http://www.wowdb.com/quests/31454-a-legend-in-the-making) while talking about the future of Azeroth. <br />
<br />
The first quest (http://www.wowdb.com/quests/31468-trial-of-the-black-prince) in the series requires an honored reputation level, which is earned by killing the mogu and mantid in the Townlong Steppes and the Dread Wastes, as well as any raid creatures. <br />
<br />
You must also collect (http://www.wowdb.com/quests/31473-the-strength-of-ones-foes) &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wowdb.com/items/87209-sigil-of-wisdom&quot; class=&quot;wow-item wow-item-q5 item5&quot;&gt;Sigil of Wisdom&lt;/a&gt; x 10 and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wowdb.com/items/87208-sigil-of-power&quot; class=&quot;wow-item wow-item-q5 item5&quot;&gt;Sigil of Power&lt;/a&gt; x 10 from Mogu'shan Vaults, Heart of Fear, or Terrace of Endless Spring. While you are raiding, you need to defeat the Sha of Fear (http://www.wowdb.com/quests/31481-fear-itself) in Terrace of Endless Spring to obtain a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wowdb.com/items/87210-chimera-of-fear&quot; class=&quot;wow-item wow-item-q5 item5&quot;&gt;Chimera of Fear&lt;/a&gt;.<br />
<br />
At some point after this he will reward you with a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wowdb.com/items/87212-breath-of-the-black-prince&quot; class=&quot;wow-item wow-item-q5 item5&quot;&gt;Breath of the Black Prince&lt;/a&gt;, but the quests are not chained yet, so we can't be certain as to what the requirements are. <br />
<br />
According to the quest descriptions he seems heavily invested in the fate of Pandaria, even hinting towards (http://www.wowdb.com/quests/31483-incoming) the oncoming Horde and Alliance war fleets that will turn the beach of Krasarang Wilds into a battlezone in Patch 5.1.<br />

Last Chance to Sign Up: Level-90 Arena Pass<br />
On May 22, your opportunity to register (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/game/arena/) for the World of Warcraft 2012 Arena Pass will come to an end. Don’t miss this chance to experience the next level of Arena combat on a special realm dedicated to competitive PvP.<br />
<br />
Bonus Level-90 Arena Pass Realm<br />
<br />
In addition to granting access to the exclusive level-85 Arena Pass realm, players will also gain access to the special level-90 competition when the realm reopens a few weeks after Mists of Pandaria launches. This means that Arena Pass subscribers who have purchased the expansion will be able to access level-90 gear and talents, and be able to take a level-90 monk into the Arena with top level gear.<br />
<br />
Players who purchase an Arena Pass and participate in the competition can earn an Armored Murloc in-game pet. The top players will also contend for a chance to achieve the “Vanquisher” title for their live characters.<br />
If you would like to demonstrate your Arena prowess, are eager for a chance to earn exclusive loot, or just want to reserve a spot in the level-90 Mists of Pandaria Arena Pass realm, the time to register is now! <br />

Method (http://methodwow.com/) has taken on Inferno Skeleton King and defeated him!<br />
1 day after release, and they beat act 1, and act 2 as well already on inferno i think.<br />
They have only killed the Skeleton King at this point. Do note that up to the Skeleton king is only part of the first act and they still have lots of the game to go till they complete act 1.<br />
<br />
Another point to be made is that this is a group of fully co-ordinated, skilled, dedicated and hardcore gamers who have been playing regularly since the moment of release. It will take quite a while longer for the average player and even most seasoned gamers to reach this point. That being said, it's amazing to see the speed in which they have reached this stage of the game, but remember that the hardest is yet to come...<br />

Diablo 3 Beaten in 7 Hours<br />
I'm one of those people who likes to explore all of the map, because you never know what might be lurking in that unexplored part, right? I'm in no hurry to rush through because that's not my play style, but I know we're all different. Some people love the bragging rights that come with being super quick through a game. Meh, I prefer to take my time, soak up the atmosphere, listen to the story, and loot every single damn barrel I find.<br />
<br />
But yeah, as others here have said, completing normal mode is by no means finishing the game... It's just the start. (Blue Tracker (http://www.diablofans.com/blizz-tracker/topic/223531-diablo-3-beaten-in-just-7-hours/) / Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/d3/en/forum/topic/4210101118?page=2#22))<br />
<br />
Diablo 3 Beaten in 6 Hours<br />
That's the problem... people are used to playing Skyrim<br />
You can beat Skyrim in a few hours if your intent is to rush to the end of the game as fast as possible. You can beat the original Super Mario Bros in 5 minutes.<br />
<br />
If your intent is to simply race to the end of the game as quickly as possible I'm sure you can complete Normal difficulty in very little time. If your intent is to take your time and enjoy it, stop worrying about what people rushing to the end of the game think.<br />
<br />
Luckily, unlike other games, regardless of how quickly you want to rush to the end, the near-limitless content provided through randomized events, dungeons, enemies and items (and their random drop chance) mean that you'll be able to play for years to come. Welcome to Diablo III, please enjoy. (Blue Tracker (http://www.diablofans.com/blizz-tracker/topic/223303-im-confused-game-was-only-6-hours-long/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/d3/en/forum/topic/5051765524?page=7#123))<br />

...and then there are the people that stopped playing WoW after vanilla and come to MMO champ and bitch about how they hate MoP. You know who you are...<br />

The Black Prince = Edward of Woodstock, wouldnt be the first time his name appears in a video game, iam not the history men and to tired to google now, but i think i remember that he wears alot of crystalls (on his armor+rings, but no idea its over 13years since i last wisted a history lesson in school) so this &quot;legendary&quot; might be something to upgrade something else (=tank orange upgrade for their weapons or ring (he had a famous ring but i doubt that they will bring an orange ring)</div></div><hr />

Some people do. Lots of people, sadly. We charitably say that those people 'lack class.'<br />
<br />
That said, it does make the daily posts feel a little disjointed to me. If I fail to notice the D3 icon before a bullet-point, I'm left wondering when they added an 'Inferno Skeleton King' raid and how I missed that, or something to that effect. Today's post had some WoW info sandwiched between D3 news, and that was just hard to read. A filter would be nice, just to keep the information sorted... unless there already is one and I'm just not seeing it.</div></div><hr />

Get a grip. It's a gaming website. Blizzard makes WoW and Diablo. WoW is dead this week due to D3 so there is bound to be some hype and news around it. You're all whining like little girls that are on PMS. It's a Curse's website, run by Boub. Even though there is a specific Diablo website under curse, MMO-Champion has a lot bigger user base and gets more views than probably all of the other fan sits/community sites put together.<br />

Well at least this has a definite 'launch' time like an MMO so everyone was on a level playing field (with plenty of time to prepare in the beta, just like WoW) and this site does have a Blizz bias to it. Given the annual pass offer a lot of WoW players hare playing Diabl at the moment - I know most of my guild seems to be...<br />
<br />
OTOH, like Guildwars 2, there is a dedicated Diablo site here and there's an argument that D3 and GW2 announcements could be left to those sites and this one should just focus on WoW.</div></div><hr />

Secondly is this the same Method from WoW? If it is what is with this urge to blitz through a game and sacrifice socializing and sleep just to be the first at something,how very very sad....if you watch the Butcher kill then skip to 2:54 and just listen to the guys reaction to the kill,it literally sounds like he just had a great orgasm.<br />

While it certainly is his site it wouldn´t be this place people would go to get their Diablo updates - and as noted the update shouldn´t be focused around it being Diablo 3, but that Method did something. I do however not see it as that spectacular even with the difficulty level considering you can basicly rush it from the checkpoint. Now if it had been on hardcore I would be fully impressed. Updating with it on the site just because its them seem like a fanboy service to me.<br />

The release of Diablo 3 was literally one of the biggest traffic day on MMO-Champion. Just because you don't care doesn't mean it applies to everyone.<br />
<br />
The fact that D3 was bundled with the annual pass for over a million players makes it &quot;slightly&quot; relevant.</div></div><hr />

because only things YOU like are the ones that last forever... yea that makes you soo less ignorant. You see the future better then everyone else? Diablo isn't an mmo it dosn't compete directly with wow, different fan base. Why you bring up other mmos and thier ignorance that matches yours is beyond logic. Then gain Blizzard worshippers have never been logical.<br />
<br />
btw to you and all the other bobble head posters agreeing with you, internet=/=house. It's pretty much infinitely closer to a business and customers/recipients matter a lot more there.<br />
<br />
It's amazing how people who love blizzard are so close-minded then yell at others for being close minded. The hypocrisy makes you much worse.<br />

What's with the &quot;world firsts&quot;? It's not an MMO. You didn't announce the names of the people who finished more popular games like Mass Effect 3 or Call of Duty first.<br />
<br />
Yea it's pretty stupid. Despite this site being called MMOchamp it is incredibly biased on reporting basically only 1 mmo and even then it loses focus because their god blizzard released a second game.<br />
<br />
They might as well report who beat every other game that comes out first if they ever want to be thought of anything other then blizzard slaves with no mind.</div></div><hr />

That said, reading over various thoughts and view points on the validity of Diablo news here on mmo-champion, I must wonder if there's any incentive (read: $$$) for the reports (read: advertising) of Diablo 3 here. As other have said, it's not a MMO, merely another Blizzard product. I don't recall this many reports on other actual MMO's that go as in depth as these ones have. A mention of SWTOR? Sure. A tidbit about Conan? Yup. An in depth analysis of classes, mechanics, and systems within those games? Not really.</div></div><hr />

To answer that post from Captainarlong, D3 is just way more popular than those 2 games you mentioned. Hell I don't play them and don't know anyone else who plays them either. Not saying those games aren't popular but D3 is way more popular than them. D3 brought in old diablo players,WoW players, and new players. Just saying... This site should be called MMO-Complainer.com All i see on forums is a bunch of complaining about the most stupid crap, at least it's entertaining though lol.<br />

I'm inclined to agree. If I wanna know about Diablo 3, I can always check diablofans...I would agree but it seems D3fanz website is down or something. It wont connect :(<br />

What's with the &quot;world firsts&quot;? It's not an MMO. You didn't announce the names of the people who finished more popular games like Mass Effect 3 or Call of Duty first.<br />
<br />
Well D3 I beleive has world first achievements, does thos other games have achievements? Seriously Idk I never played Mass effect or CoD so yea.<br />

While it certainly is his site it wouldn´t be this place people would go to get their Diablo updates - and as noted the update shouldn´t be focused around it being Diablo 3, but that Method did something. I do however not see it as that spectacular even with the difficulty level considering you can basicly rush it from the checkpoint. Now if it had been on hardcore I would be fully impressed. Updating with it on the site just because its them seem like a fanboy service to me.<br />
<br />
In regards to the other news the legendary item sounds interesting tbh. Would be fun if they made a new way to obtain a legendary (as long as its not overly easy ofc).<br />
<br />
I think ppl are missing the point why it's on the front page of MMO lol. It's because it's the most recent popular game released... derp. Keep raging ppl you making me laugh! lol.</div></div><hr />
