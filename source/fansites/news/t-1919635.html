Legion - Storm Dragon Mount<br />
The Storm Dragon mount is one of the new mount models added in Legion. There isn't an entry in the mount journal yet, so we don't know the source.<br />

Classes<br />
How will glyphs that don't alter spells be handled? (i.e. priest glyph of angels)<br />
Things like Confession, Treant Form, Illusion likely learned from tomes. Angels likely triggered by a certain spell. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/675414085123506176))<br />

Will DH's GCD be 1 sec or 1.5 sec? Also are there any plans to alter any other classes GCD?<br />
1.5 second base, reduced by haste (similar to most other non-energy melee). (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/675412587752787968))<br />

holy paladin in legion raiding, stand in melee? Or back with range? Or bounce between the two groups?<br />
Depends on the fight. Sometimes Holy Paladins will prefer to stand with ranged, sometimes with whomever they're healing. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/675412274039808000))<br />

Any chance Pistol Shot for Outlaws might see unique animation/unique gun? Gret concept let down by a Vanilla Blunderbuss model<br />
The current art for Pistol Shot in the Legion Alpha is temporary. It will have a new gun and animation. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/675117660259135488))<br />

So will aff/destro locks have any form of burst cooldowns other than summon Doomguard/Infernal since dark soul is gone?<br />
There are a few talents that improve burst, and the Doomguard/Infernal are being buffed to deal significantly more damage. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/675411821210169345))<br />
<br />
Artifact Wepaons<br />
Will our artifacts be able to unlock additional relic slots at some point?<br />
Artifacts start with 2 relic slots and unlock a 3rd shortly after reaching 110. We're not planning any additional slots. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/675118010940702720))<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
does this mean tank specs will be viable in PvP also?<br />
We're looking into ways to make tanks fun - both to play as, and to play against - in PvP. It's a tough challenge. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/675119169545875456))<br />
<br />
why not just make racials unavailable for pvp?<br />
We feel racials are an important part of what defines your character, and should come into PvP with you. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/675119332217790470))<br />
<br />
Lore<br />
Mr.Koask could you please clear the situation with Vol'Jin? You said he is warchief and in quests it's Sylvanas! what happened?<br />
If you're checking out the alpha, you're only getting part of the story, none of the intro, and none of the cinematics. Yet! (DaveKosak (https://twitter.com/DaveKosak/status/675098136067645440))<br />
<br />
Transmogrification<br />
Rumor from alpha is clothies can unlock cloth transmog but plate cannot. Intended behavior?<br />
Intended. Plate wearers unlock plate, mail wearers unlock mail, etc. Weapons must be equippable by that character. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/675118823566147584))<br />
<br />
If I unlocked the CM armor during MOP on one warlock, if I make another will I be able to XMOG it on him with the new system?<br />
Yep! Any characters of the same class will be able to wear the Challenge Mode sets if you've unlocked them. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/675429731626430464))<br />
Can we discuss that &quot;Weapons must be equippable&quot; thing for staves/polearms?<br />
I refuse to discuss polearms after &quot;the incident&quot;. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/675431004249579520))<br />
<br />
<br />
Ghostcrawler Tweets<br />
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br />
I see. I was watching some legion alpha streams and artifact stuff looks promising, can't wait to test/play it.<br />
I agree. Looks cool. Shades of Paths of the Titans, down to titan names. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/672585490617405440))<br />
<br />
How do you keep your team motivated when deadlines loom and setbacks start to/have happened? How do you boost morale?<br />
One of the best things for morale is shipping things and seeing it in the hands of players / customers. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/672861236120322048))<br />
Newbie managers sometimes focus too much on individual feelings during a time of crisis. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/672861332417327104))<br />
When actually your team may thank you later for being decisive when Shit Gets Real. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/672861568426631169))<br />
You can focus on the softer aspects of team morale when you have more bandwidth and fewer deadlines looming. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/672861648273604609))<br />
<br />
Hey, GC, how hard is it to take a wow boss mechanic, like Shadow Crash, and make it a player ability? Is it technically hard?<br />
If it's tied to the room geometry (target this x,y coordinate) then it can be hard. A lot of class abilities started with bosses. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/673143612075458560))<br />
<br />
I understand, do u think redesigning classes every xpac is a good idea? I despise having to relearn the specs I play esp. 1/2<br />
I like class change. I was sad in WoD when the direction was minimal change. But having to relearn is the big risk. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/673144132601184256))<br />
<br />
what is a Devs definition of &quot;Balance&quot; equal everything or as close as balanceable?<br />
Depends on devs and projects. Usually it's something like decisions of what / how to play aren't driven by raw power. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/674042467474214913))<br />
<br />
Systems designers distinguish between &quot;balanced&quot; and &quot;balanceable&quot; and focus more on the latter since it's a lot harder. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/673989369959698432))<br />
how do unbalanceable things form? i.e. by what general mechanism does a system/mechanic become unbalanceable?<br />
Things are balanceable if they have tuning knobs. A switch with on/off lacks tuning knobs. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/674042966801956864))<br />
An ability that is &quot;kill next target&quot; doesn't scale with target health or power, so you lack an ability to tune it. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/674043220888698880))<br />
<br />
like why make it balancable if you don't then use that work to try achieve balance.<br />
Totally. Balance is the end goal and the most important in the end. We just talk about the hard part which is balanceable. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/673997803002003456))<br />
Sadly, what isn't balance-able is community perception. Once they believe something is bad, it's hard to change that view.<br />
That's true, but players don't owe use endlessly trying something to see if it's finally fixed yet. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/674248424988917760))<br />

And yet is does look very cool a lot better than some of the drake models WoTLK like the Bronze Drake mount out of Culling of Stratholme and the varied other colours.. The only good looking drakes from that expac were the Proto Drakes..</div></div><hr />

Some punches, some kicks, some chi and a little bit of lightning (Xuen); that's about it. Perhaps they didn't/don't want Monks 'stealing' wind from Shamans or something. The weapons will have to do.</div></div><hr />

It would have been funny early during the expansion, but now that it's down to about 1 gold per ore, it's not very useful.<br />

Strictly speaking, you have 4 stages of &quot;new&quot; in 3D:<br />
<br />
Recolor: same texture, just swap tinting.<br />
Retexture: same mesh, just change textures<br />
Reskin: same skeleton, just change the mesh<br />

The flying animation shares the same rig as all the other drake mounts, but I'm fairly certain that walk cycle is not the same. They must've cross rigged it, sort of like what they did with Protodrake/Raven Lord mount to make the WoD collector's edition mount.</div></div><hr />

I like smallar mounts too, and really dont like the look of the wings. But the dragon itself looks really good.<br />
<br />
And in legion the system will be similar to warlords. The big difference is that they are clear about it from the start now.</div></div><hr />

Some punches, some kicks, some chi and a little bit of lightning (Xuen); that's about it. Perhaps they didn't/don't want Monks 'stealing' wind from Shamans or something. The weapons will have to do.<br />

Obviously you're not the only one that doesn't care about mounts, but you didn't say &quot;some of us&quot;, you said NO ONE cared. Duh. Some of us DO care about them, and those that don't will just have to get over it and ignore news on mounts same as the rest of us have to ignore news we don't give a shit about whenever they appear.<br />
