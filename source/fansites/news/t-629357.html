really, this isn't a big nerf in the end...<br />
and I don't see the reason to nerf this talent.. it wont nerf our damage nor our cc really.. with the current proc rate of poisons..<br />
30% when ya allready got a 50% proc rate and as mutilate .. you don't need to worry about anything else then .. druids that got a remove poisons over time effect. Everyone else, (If not shamans with totems) doesn't really try to remove your poisons anyway.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stroppe</div><div class="date">2009-01-09, 01:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">* Lock and Load now has a 30 seconds cooldown.<br />
<br />
This is really interesting... Forcing the talent that the whole SV spec rotates around to be on a 30 second cooldown is not realy kind towards hunters who find this a pvp flavour.<br />
<br />
SV requires alot of skill to play, as it's a decent arsenal of harder-to-use CC combined with a fair damage output, that came all from the &quot;lock and load&quot; talent. I have personaly always found it more apealing to play than the &quot;imune-to-all&quot; BM.<br />
<br />
The good thing about it, was that Serpent Sting was something you could use in adition to a trap proc to get Lock and Load. <br />
If you want Lock and Load to recieve a nerf, then it should at least be cut down to the minimal cooldown the traps have (talented), since it IS one of the hunter's defences, seeing as he uses it to spike the target AFTER he buys the time when under attacked, by traping it. (i.e. vs rogues)<br />
<br />
After this new &quot;screw up&quot; in fixing talents, I believe that the cooldown on Lock and Load will be greatly lowered after some time on live.<br />
<br />
BM will longer be as good in pvp after the patch comes (I never liked it honestly), MM is not what arenas require now, since longer mana-drain matches are OUT of the question with the burst DKs, Ret, Mages, Rogues...etc have (and that will NOT change much), only SV remains as the viable spec. With Lock and Load locked behind a 30 second CD, serious problems will arise in this atempt to &quot;fix&quot; things.</div></div><hr />

Well, these items are not available from the trainer in the new patch anymore. It is possible that they are out of the game all together. However, I found one person that had already crafted himself the defender, and it has been changed to bind on equip, and it is properly labeled as an axe now. Because they bothered to make these changes, I bet it is still in the game. It is not an emblem trade-in, I checked, so maybe the pattern drops off a heroic boss now.

The implication that they're not interested in creating additional 2-handed tanking weapons at all was the point. Christ.<br />
<br />
<br />
How thick are you? There is not a single avoidance stat for druids that is better than agility assuming you have blessing of kings up.<br />
<br />
That means that a 2H with dodge rating, parry rating or defense rating is going to be a worse tanking weapon for a druid than a 2H with the same amount of agility.<br />
<br />
So exactly what stats do you want them to put on a 2H for your druid that you don't get already? The only possible tanking stat you could benefit from is dodge rating but agility gives you greater benefit point for point already.<br />

<br />
DK tanks?<br />

Just because there are 100 times more nightelf druids around it doesnt mean that they're alone. ::)<br />

<br />
DK tanks could make a point that they need 2H tanking weapons if they want, the post I was responding to was by a druid which makes no sense whatsoever.<br />
<br />
I think DK weapon tanking stats are adequately covered by the rune system. You can't get a weapon itemised specifically for tanking but you can add a lot of tanking stats to a weapon for free which works out just as well. Factor in that both Str and Agility provide some avoidance for DKs and I think its pretty much a non issue.</div></div><hr />

now it reduces chance on dispell vs all HELPFUL spells.. well wtf is a non helpful spell<br />
<br />
retarded crap, what determines if a spell is helpful to us or not... very poor wording<br />

The general rule of thumb is that helpful spells (e.g. buffs) and dots are protected. Other offensive spells (e.g. crowd controls) are not.</div></div><hr />

Deep Wounds nerf<br />
When I saw the Deep Wounds nerf this was a slap into my face.<br />
<br />
<br />
Deep Wounds is causing too high a percent of damage for Fury and Arms, 20 or 30% of total damage on some fights, and often above white attacks. Since it is unmitigated damage we are eventually going to have balance problems here if we don't already.<br />
<br />
Fury is slightly high in PvE, or definitely will be after these TOO [sic] changes. Arms is too low in PvE, which is why I said we wanted to buff them.<br />
<br />
We like Deep Wounds' position in the tree. We're fine letting all warriors reach it. It's just too good.<br />
<br />
SORRY but WTF???<br />
<br />
Arms is too low in PVE. It is quite Difficult to deal good damage, and now they want to nerf us?... WTF. STUF f***** Blizzard.<br />

If you think really hard there is another reason. Almost every content patch BC blizz added new badge items. Think it will stop here? What blizz is hoping is that everyone will blow there valor badges to get hero badges to in turn blow on the rare gems you can buy with them after patch. The content patch comes out and they go &quot;oh man check out this new valor gear... wait you spent your badges.. noob&quot; Im sure valor will keep droping in Ulduar.<br />

<br />
So this wont effect Viper Sting anymore.. making this a useless ability. Thats 3 talent points i can spend elsewhere.<br />
<br />
Come to think of it, this talent now only effects Serpent Sting and Wyvern Sting since its the only DMG over time sting we got. Making this a big nerf for BM and MM, and a little less of a nerf for Surv.. Unless they plan on fusing vipersting with serpent sting and scorpid sting, speccing Improved Stings is even more useless then i previously thought.<br />
<br />
While Blizzard nerf hunters for PVE, hunters are becomming more and more a joke in PVP. Improved Stings was a PVP talent, and so is vipersting. If Blizzard doesnt have anything for hunters in patch 3.08 wich is really valid for PVP i see yet another horrible season on arena in the future!</div></div><hr />

That is why you might want to swap Emblem of Valor for Emblem of Heroism. It is just so that once you no longer need any badge items you can trade them in for gems. Nothing more than that.</div></div><hr />

My hunch is they'll use the same scheme as they used for arena gear in BC, introduce new stuff for those running cutting-edge content and move the existing stuff to the bargain bin. Current 25-man badge gear would be purchasable with heroism badges once a new tier of valor badge gear comes out.</div></div><hr />

this would only have come in handy just to try something new or for the looks.<br />
<br />
its simple stupid they removed it, their no reason on doing it since dks r the ones that r gonna rely on em the most.<br />
<br />
plus many dks prefered dps over tanking for the same reason they lack on on two handers for tanking and if the dual wield the mostlikely to die for the parry mechanism some bosses have.<br />
<br />
in other words u gotta sacrifice some stats to make up for others unless ur on naxx gear then those 2 handers dont matter since u gonna be geared by now.<br />
<br />
so much for saving up by titansteel bars.<br />
<br />
also why not removed those maces,dagger and etc. like the person that reply that blue post say u dont want anyone running around on epics from the start and not doing 5 man heroics or raids.</div></div><hr />

That was hotfixed several days after it became common knowledge. You can no longer spellsteal the Bone Shield, meaning dispellers now need to pay attention and remove it rather than spamming DPS macros. That, or you punch through 1.5 million damage, every time the mob recasts.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mushin</div><div class="date">2009-01-10, 12:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Was Wildfury Greatstaff so horrible for having 57 dodge instead of the ~40 agility it might have had instead? (estimating based on Blizzards usual agility/stamina ratio on staves) (and ignoring that feral tanks back then actually had to put effort into choosing their gear, since they couldn't just switch from Earthwarden to Wildfury without ensuring they stayed def capped. I don't miss playing with the def cap, but at the same time it has made picking tanking gear a matter of practically whatever you have with the best raw stats.)<br />
<br />
Ratings and stats cost the same item points, so 57 dodge = 57 agility.<br />
<br />
57 dodge = 3.01% dodge.<br />
57 agility = 3.45% dodge + 2.28% crit + 114 armor.<br />
<br />
So yeah, Wildfury Greatstaff would have been greatly improved by having Agility instead of Dodge Rating. Personally, I'm very much looking forward to the change because it will make druid tanking weapons much easier to come across because there won't be basically one-per-tier now that agility staves aren't specific to one spec and agility polearms aren't specific to one class.<br />
<br />
I'd much rather Blizzard itemized relics for tanking (like actually put stats on them rather than &quot;improve one spell +3%&quot;) than have them waste it on making two-handed maces for classes who are already theoretically fine with dps weapons and don't even want the same tanking stats as each other.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mushin</div><div class="date">2009-01-10, 12:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Unless you are a hybrid valor badges really don't buy much, I have 75 of them just sitting on my mage because I already bought the only piece of gear I needed, which was the tier shoulders.<br />
<br />
Even as a hybrid they don't buy much - by the time I had enough for an item I'd already gotten equivalent or better pieces to the ones on sale. Beyond filling out the tier-slots the only real use is buying Hateful pieces.<br />
Now I can convert those extra badges into Heirloom pieces or a mammoth without being 'forced' to run heroics or 10 mans that I vastly out-gear.<br />
<br />
In regards to speculators in this thread that the current Valor items will 'drop down' to Heroism badges when Ulduar brings in a new wave of badge items - I don't see that happening. I'm expecting a new tier of badges (Emblem of Titanosity? :D) that will convert on a 1-1 basis to Valor - otherwise you'd have the silly spectacle of guilds turning up to their first Ulduar raid with members in 2 piece tier 8.<br />
<br />
Using Heroism as a 'base' currency for rewards like the mammoth, or purchasable gems, makes those items available for basically everyone, and having Heroism purchasable for higher badges makes those items effectively the same cost for everyone regardless of their progression level.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also on the subject of blacksmithing, the change to the reinforced cobalt items was silly the way they did it, they should have just lowered the required level and item level for the items so that there was then a gap between them and the savage saronite items at 78 if they are under the mistaken impression that there is any point to those recipes beyond being fodder for disenchanting.<br />
<br />
The valor to heroism being a 1:1 trade seems a little harsh and/or pointless and as far as ulduar, the most likely ilevel for the 10 man gear in there would be 213 the same as naxx25 so why would they need to obsolete valor badges when those could simply get used for ulduar10 and just one new set being needed for ulduar25.</div></div><hr />

<br />
like i said tho, i dont care about the Titansteel Defender, i was looking forward to the Deflector with 90 parry rating...its hard enough trying to stack that...but as a DK tank 2h tanking means you need a lot of parry, and hell...90 parry only gets us what 1.83% parry....either put the weapon back in game...or change the amount of parry needed per percent....right now duel wielding does have its disadvantages due to boss parrying more of our attacks...so stacking expertise has become huge for me as well...(which isn't easy due to having mostly def gems in my gear to stay cap'd...<br />
<br />
bliz fixed the issue with dk's and def by adding in the new runeforge recipe but dont take out the one weapon a lotta people have been waiting for....keep the parry sword... and who knows maybe a fury warrior would use the parry sword in their offhand? whats worse than going up against a fury warrior in bg's? oh thats right....having them parry you and whomp your face again.... =P<br />
