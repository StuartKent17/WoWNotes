Patch 4.2: We Bid Thy Keyring Adieu<br />
World of Warcraft has evolved quite a bit since the day the Keyring bag slot was added in patch 1.11. When implemented, this Keyring provided players with a convenient way of storing dungeon, quest, and other keys automatically. Back when the largest bag was a mind bottling 18 slots - rumoured to be bottomless - the Keyring helped save precious bag space. But as things tend to do, time went on, bags got bigger, and designs for gating content (literally and figuratively) evolved through the years.<br />
<br />
In today’s Azeroth, keys don’t really serve much of a purpose except to take up physical storage space from the game (which could be used for other awesome stuff), and visual interface space on yours. Because of this, we’ve decided to get rid of the Keyring in order to free up some user interface space for exciting new features. This change could also potentially allow us to play around with the amount of default storage space you’re allotted down the road. So, what does this mean for you and the keys you might not have looked at in the last couple expansions or so?<br />
<br />
We’re currently working on the implementation of a system in patch 4.2 which will handle the removal of the Keyring, while causing you as little hassle with keys as possible. Some keys which no longer serve a purpose in the game will automatically be removed from your inventory. In return, you’ll be compensated for them with their respective vendor sell prices in gold. You might also have random leftover quest keys from outdated quests, or quests which were removed in Cataclysm. Keys that fall into this category have no use and no sell price, as they are labelled as quest items, and will be automatically removed from your inventory. Any remaining keys that might still potentially serve some use in the game will be transferred into your regular inventory. If there is not enough space in your inventory to hold any leftover keys once patch 4.2 hits live realms, the keys will be placed in a backlogged storage system. Once space is made for a backlogged key, the key will take that space after you log out or switch to a new zone (i.e. changing continents, entering a dungeon or Battleground, etc.).<br />
<br />
We are continuing to work on new ways of allowing you to better manage the storage of various items in the game, and it is our goal to make sure the removal of the Keyring causes as little inconvenience to you as possible. <br />
<br />
Update<br />
So, just as a reference here are the keys we're currently seeing as ones that will not be converted to gold or removed upon release of the patch -- if you have them they'd be put back into your normal inventory. This isn't necessarily a final list, and it's possible we could cut the list down even further before 4.2 releases.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Poodles</div><div class="date">2011-05-23, 04:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So wait, they needed the room in the UI? That doesn't make sense as they could easily make the bar wider. Sounds like a cop out to cluttering our bags.<br />
<br />
Before all this, we didn't have dual specs and PvP gear didn't have resil (i.e. people weren't running around with at least 3 sets of gear in their bags). Bag space is still precious...</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is currently the case on the PTR, which made many players unhappy - particularly those with blacksmith keys. I would (hopefully) expect that this will change before going live.<br />
<br />
My problem with this change is that Blizzard is removing stuff again. I like my keys. They make me feel important, besides having sentimental value.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What I suspect is that Blizzard's oh so precious &quot;premium service&quot; needs a permanent spot in the game, to remind everyone that even though they've already tithed this month, they need to give, give, give!<br />
<br />
I really am saddened at losing some of my keys, it's not the end of the world, but it certainly seems a little silly.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That is what they keyring is, a bag for keys. But as Blizzard says they want to &quot;free up some user interface space&quot;, you mean all 25 pixels wide of user interface?! OMFG! SO MUCH SAVED SPACE!</div></div><hr />

Why?<br />
<br />
Sure, keys and key-gated content is an outdated system that we basically don't use any more nowadays but why not just remove the thing entirely?<br />
And if for some odd reason that cant happen then let us keep our keyring?<br />
The 3 millimetres it takes on my screen don't bother me now and i doubt people even notice it being gone.<br />
<br />
'We are removing the keyring since we don't like keys any more and try to get rid of them' <br />
<br />
Ok.<br />
<br />
'Keys that will retain their use will be dumped back into your bags and if you don't have any space we'll keep hindering you with em till you finally clear the backlog of your precious keys'.<br />

The keyring feature was awesome because it saved a lot of inventory space wasting items from being in my bags. With this I feel that they are also going to kill the whole Attunement process like they did for all the vanilla wow stuff when WoLK came out. I think this goes along the principal that wow is removing all of the challenging content and features from the game and turning into Alliance/Horde Island Adventure. I quit playing wow almost 2 months ago because Cataclysm made the game boring, unchallenging, and uneventful for me. This is yet another &quot;advancement' that takes me further away from playing Warcraft. How about removing useless crap from the game and adding something important like tabard manager or something like that So I dont have 1/3 of my bank space filled with tabards. How about putting out challenging content instead of Crap-aclysm. I waited 18 months for this garbage? And now they are adding the dungeon journal. Why dont you just have a content engineer handy so I can just call and ask them to walk me through a fight. -- I know I got a bit off topic here, but i just feel sad for the people who still play waiting for the challenge to come back to WoW. I spent 5 years playing warcraft, and I loved every second of it, but its kinda dead to me now because of changes like this. Some people who havent played since BC or Vanilla may not realize the significance of this change, but for me it represents a huge change in the dynamic of the game (losing heroic attunments, ect) from where you had to challenge yourself to get rep to progress, vs now I can just got to the AH to meet the minimum gear score requirement... yet another way of integrating shit players who buy their way to the top, vs good players who work hard to achieve goals.</div></div><hr />

Sometimes it made me happy with where WoW has gone, when i can look back and see how annoying grinding specific instances for rep was in BC with those specific rep keys. But I don't have enough bag space for the stuff I have, putting those keys back in my normal inventory is going to be a pain the ass. I hope this means they will be making the bags bigger, even though i believe they said they can't just keep making bigger bags because eventually when you open your bags/bank your screen will be filled with bags.

That's what I take from it. We're getting rid of some keys, but the ones we aren't are now going to be hidden around in your invertory that we had cleared up by removing keys from in the first place.<br />

Honestly, players have become a little spoiled with regards to bag space. I mean, it really was difficult back in the day to keep track of all your stuff back when bags were considerably smaller and non-combat pets and mounts took up bag space. The keyring was a huge convenience that allowed for that scant bag space to be used for something else. Now, it's just a relic from the past. If they finally get around to giving tabards their own space and take away that spacewaster, then having a couple of keys for old content is no big deal.</div></div><hr />

Hmm, so they couldnt just add it as a tab on the dungeon finder window. Another very intelgient move by Blizzard.

Sarcasm detection system...malfunctioning. Many feats are not worthy of being a feat (I'm looking at you, collector's edition pets), but it would be nice to have as a record of something I did in the past that was permanently removed from the game. The weapon skill feat comes to mind as something similar.</div></div><hr />

Was that not the point of the keyring...I don't get it...You want the keyring gone, but you don;t want to drag keys around (head explodes).<br />
<br />
And if you really wanted to run Kara at least, maybe you should actually have to work and do the quest chain.<br />

I, personally as a Blacksmith, do not like this, at least increase the stock bag space from 18 to 30 or something.<br />

<br />
To be fair, this is a UI/systems change, not a raid content change. Different team of developers.<br />
<br />
That said, there are much better/more important things they could be working on than something that goes against what they've said their design goals were. Reducing item clutter. Costumes tab. Tabards tab. Less static quest items. Etc...but instead, they're throwing our keys in our already crowded bags. BRILLIANT!</div></div><hr />

They are &quot;working on a system&quot; and that is supposed to cause &quot;as little inconvinience&quot; as possible. Does that sound like these keys will end up cluttering your bags.<br />

It has been a year since I've had a looksie at them by accident. If Blizzard just make us not need to use keys anymore, and just walk into dungeons, then that's just fine. It puzzles me if they take away this... 24(?) slot key bag, and make us waste space on keys we didn't have to think about since the keychain was implemented eons ago, and still have to use keys to get into certain dungeons, though. They really should just toss them all overboard at once.</div></div><hr />

Perhaps now is the time to give us our hard earned 'Keymaster' achievement as a feat of strength, huh Blizz?They removed Keymaster patches ago, and didn't make it an FoS. Leads me to believe it will never happen sadly<br />
<br />
I doubt they even have the ability to make it a FoS. They likely wiped out the associated player data when it was removed from the game, and have no means of determining who earned it.<br />
<br />
<br />
I lol'd...<br />
<br />
Sorry but this achievement was very easy to get. I got it without even thinking during the wrath leveling process. Hardly worthy of a FoS. Oo <br />
<br />
Your statement is likely true. But speaking from my experience as a mage that earned those keys at the times when they were part of current content - it was hard-earned.</div></div><hr />

It would be nice if there was something implemented like the keys for TBC heroics, Kara, Algalon, etc, would just be learnt as spells which let you unlock the doors, rather than having to make bank space for all of the keys and remembering to take them with you any time you might actually have need of them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
All in 1 bag, and the keyring stays. It removes 4 icons worth of space and gives everyone an addon everyone already uses. And those that prefer to have bags can use the all in 1 bag splitter, which turns the big bag into 4 smaller manageable bags which can be transferred in and out of the bank.</div></div><hr />

It's a feature nearly everyone uses, nobody wants to carry their keys in their bags, a lot of people like having the old keys as a sort of sense of achievement, not to mention the keyring takes up what, a quarter of a centimeter of space? I think that's a fairly generous assumption too.

I honestly do not understand how or why anyone would relate the removal of keys to premium features. This just goes to show the community has taken things a little off the deep end in regards to that post.<br />
Because they remove a perfectly fine working feature noone ever complained about. And considering what blizzard said they would never implement in to the game: &quot;Extra payment of any form for features or items that affects the gameplay for one player over another player.&quot; Though this cross realm Real-ID dungeon crap they are implementing for a premium payment could be considered a convenience more than an advatage in gameplay, it seem to alert players of a possible &quot;fear&quot; that blizzard may re-implement a similar keystorage feature as a premium payment that yet again will be seen as a convenience as a loophole to their old promise. And also fear what they will come up with next time and present as a premium feature.<br />
<br />
It's probably just the fact that removes good features for no good reasons and implement premium features that easy could have just been added to the game for no charge.<br />
<br />
Considering the amount of money they recieve every month for subscripions, race changes, name changes and faction changes ontop of the vanity items from blizzards online store, such a feature does not really justify a monthly subscription payment or even as a single payment.<br />
6 months payment for serveraccess to play and new conrent is already more than it would cost to buy a brand new game every 6 month when compairing cost and content.</div></div><hr />

Any remaining keys that might still potentially serve some use in the game will be transferred into your regular inventory. If there is not enough space in your inventory to hold any leftover keys once patch 4.2 hits live realms, the keys will be placed in a backlogged storage system. Once space is made for a backlogged key, the key will take that space after you log out or switch to a new zone (i.e. changing continents, entering a dungeon or Battleground, etc.).</div></div><hr />

Yeah, and how many patches down the road will *that* be implemented. I need all the TBC keys because I do a lot of rep runs for people in my guild. My bank is already full of the holiday items that there's no other storage for, tabards, and rare archaeology items. I don't even have a second spec to keep gear for. I don't want to lose that many bag slots to keys, even temporarily. Why can't they just leave a system that works *alone*? Even if I could keep the keys in my bank, assuming I had room, I don't want to have to hit the damn bank every time I want to run a BC heroic or go do Maly or Kara.</div></div><hr />

In typical Blizzard fashion, they don't tell the whole story, but given past record and how they only seem to put real effort on premium services, this could potentially head the &quot;for only an extra $3/month, get the in-game keyring!&quot; sort of deal.</div></div><hr />

Hope they do not fill my bags with keys that they're supposed to remove since they're now classified as &quot;useless items&quot;. I alread see tons of BS keys in my bags right now... :(<br />
<br />
Extra UI space (like if the KR used that much) and &quot;new ways of allowing you to better manage the storage of various items in the game&quot;? I can see you Premium Storage Service!!!!!!</div></div><hr />

Everyone else needs to stop worrying because obviously, due to the comment about &quot;reimbursing&quot; money for keys, or removing &quot;quest&quot; keys, they plan to remove the vast majority of them. Once the patch hits I expect to maybe have one key out of keyring that goes into my bags, otherwise I will be getting money or a cleaned out area. No SM key, No Kara Key, No Outland Heroic Keys, No Coffer Keys, No Malygos Key or Algalon Key, those are old content that will either be saved as a quest flag or opened entirely and will no longer require keys at all.<br />
<br />
Also, it is obvious the reason they are doing this is for database purposes. Think about how much data, collectively, we are probably taking up with keys. They still are in the database like items, but serve little to no purpose anymore. Out of all the things they can remove to clear up the database, I would rather it be something like keys rather then other, more interesting items. This is why they are saying it may allow them to extend bags, as it will clear those &quot;slots&quot; in our character databases to be used for something else rather then clogging them up further. Do you guys really think our character data takes up unlimited space?</div></div><hr />

Exactly, maybe they won't auto-delete them, maybe they will even allow some to stay behind or be collected for those collectors, but don't expect any of the keys to be required anymore for anything. The key system is dead, and the only &quot;keys&quot; that will see any usage from this point on will be the blacksmith keys, and frankly, I felt those should be in the inventory considering they are used like Seaforium Charges, which don't go on the ring.<br />

People DID use the Raid Browser. It was one of the best features of Wrath for PUGgers like me. I was always in that whenever I was questing or grinding rep and I got tons of invites.<br />
<br />
The problem was Blizz broke it for f'ing four months after Cata came out. That should have been the first thing they fixed. Because people stopped using it, and got use to it being broken, and even now I'll be in a BH raid trying to fill a slot and go &quot;check LFR&quot; and people will look at me like I'm crazy.<br />

Hellz no...lock picking is more awesome than ever. The cata Lockboxes actually drop gold in addition to a green...usually around 30g. So even if you tip the rogue 5-10g to pop open the box you're still going to be to come out way ahead. Before it was kind of a crapshoot as the boxes used to drop a random green-quality item and you never really knew what that was going to be worth.<br />
<br />
Also...yesterday I opened a box that had another box in it. It was the greatest moment of my life.</div></div><hr />

It's like removing the wheels (links?) of your car every time you get home, just to put them back on when you have to leave again. It serves no more purpose than consuming and wasting your time. Besides, it's just stupid!</div></div><hr />

Blizzard said a while ago how it's not some simple thing because of how the code was written back then, and they did not expect bags to get so big. <br />
<br />
Therefore, my bet is that they are removing the key ring to integrate the code already in place into the base bag code. It's probably the most reliable way of doing it without have to recode all kinds of things which could lead to all kinds of bugs... something Blizzard is VERY good about, which they don't get enough credit for.<br />

<br />
And if you read devposts and (I can't believe I'm saying this) Q&amp;A's, you'd know that the UI devs have repeatedly said that the answer isn't bigger bags. And they're right. I don't want bigger bags. I want a drop-down selectable menu for costumes (no in-bag items associated with them, anymore). I want a drop-down menu for tabards. Things like this would &quot;create space&quot; as well, and give players something they've been asking for (in some cases) for years.<br />
<br />
In terms of &quot;more room,&quot; there's plenty of room in the UI in other places...character menu, to name one example. In terms of physical server-data space, I raise an eyebrow at the thought of keyrings taking up enough bytes to warrant it problematic. Especially since many keys aren't going anywhere...except from your keyring to your bags! Did that cover everything? I think so.<br />
<br />

But the funny thing is, is that our guys can't figure it out while the original doors are still on the thing! &lt;laughter&gt; Huh? What are the ideas? Oh, sorry, no, we can't tell you what they are, but trust us, they're really cool! When will it be done? I have no idea... our guys like to work at their own pace -- sometimes, I've seen them go 4 months on a project only to scrap it all and start over again! &lt;laughter&gt; But don't worry, you'll really like what they come up with!

<br />
This change is fine. There's probably just one key I'll still have from what I have on my keyring and I'm not maxed out constantly on bag space as it is. Also, if this leads them in the future to update the tabard system like they did with badges of justice then all the better. Yes, remember when we had badges of justice in our bags! lol.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Based on the Blue post, it's a lot more like removing the wheels from your car, just to make you carry them as you walk to work. You're looking at this as a gift from god when he's actually just trying to say &quot;F*** you.&quot; Seriously, nothing in the blue post makes this sound beneficial to anyone in any way.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Knirps</div><div class="date">2011-05-23, 06:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">And if you read devposts and (I can't believe I'm saying this) Q&amp;A's, you'd know that the UI devs have repeatedly said that the answer isn't bigger bags.<br />
<br />
In terms of &quot;more room,&quot; there's plenty of room in the UI in other places...character menu, to name one example. In terms of physical server-data space, I raise an eyebrow at the thought of keyrings taking up enough bytes to warrant it problematic. Especially since many keys aren't going anywhere...except from your keyring to your bags!<br />
<br />
Points for implying that I didn't read the post, though. A tried and true tactic.<br />
<br />
You're not understanding how this works at face value.<br />
<br />
The keyring is an infinitely expanding 'bag' on the server and in your UI. There is reserved space for every single key you may make or find. It takes up physical space on the server, and depending on your settings/UI, space in your interface.<br />
<br />
The point is not to say that there is an infinite way to make space or something in the virtual UI space, the point is that on the server, space that is allotted per character on the server space for their keys takes up physical space that is reserved for keys because the keyring isn't something that is 'regulated' in terms of how many keys you have, but is regulated in the aspect of the amount of space they can provide to you based on what the server can handle.<br />
<br />
If they take that infinite keyring expandable space and reallocate it towards tabards or extra bags, they can regulate the space better and allow for MORE interface features that take up server space, not specifically UI space, which is relatively infinite as you can hide/show/move anything you want with addons. <br />
<br />
It's incredibly simple yet complex at the same time, simply because it is a server vs. UI matter.<br />
<br />
I wasn't exactly stating that this could only lead to bigger bags, but specifically bag 'space'. As, if all your mounts, pets, tabards, and quest items were held in serverside UI interface features, you would essentially gain 'more' bagspace. The proof is obvious when you look at how much 'space' was 'gained' once mounts and pets were taken out of 'bags' and put into interface 'storage' features.</div></div><hr />

Makes sense.. Blizz all but got rid of the usefulness of keys anyway. <br />
<br />
Now.. updated models please!</div></div><hr />

It won't.<br />
We’re unlikely to add a Keymaster feat. [...]We added the Keymaster achievement and then almost immediately decided to deemphasize the existence of keys in the game, and thus removed the achievement. Unfortunately it probably isn't even possible to track who had the older keys now.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, I feel that the removal of the keyring is asinine.</div></div><hr />

<br />
BC Keys are still requires for the heroics, and we better keep them. If I have to throw up 10g per rep to get my heroic keys back I am going to Blizzard, and I am going to stab a UI Developer in the eye with his own love stick.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Here is the thing, you don't have to carry them. Keys are dead. They are no longer going to be used.<br />
<br />
You want to get into an Outland Heroic? Walk into it.<br />
<br />
You want to fight Malygos? Walk in and click the orb.<br />
<br />
Frankly, I am not understanding how this is a difficult thing to grasp. If there are some keys put into your inventory, you can delete them. They will serve no purpose other then to be for you to link in trade chat.<br />
<br />
Yes, not every key will be auto-deleted or sold back for money, some will probably stick around in other forms just because of the logistics of removing them from the database automatically is a pain. That is when you can take the time to delete them yourself and get back that precious bag space you need.<br />
<br />
And yes, this is beneficial, the less database clog on &quot;useless&quot; items, the better.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">meroko</div><div class="date">2011-05-23, 06:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">For those QQ'ing about having to carry BC heroic/kara/alg keys etc. Blizzard just responded saying those are no longer needed and removed. So the amount of keys you will ACTUALLY have will be minimal and something you probably no longer need. My guess is the only keys that will remain are old quest ones or BS for example. <br />
<br />
It's not THAT big a deal so calm down.<br />
<br />
&quot;Key requirements are removed from the examples you gave, and should be for all other similar examples. Our intent is not to remove the Keyring and then throw a bunch of keys into your normal bags, so we're going through and making changes to more or less finalize the move away from using keys that began midway through Burning Crusade.&quot;</div></div><hr />

No? Just yesterday, I rescued Finkle Einhorn from his prison in BWD. What would I have done if I didn't have any room in my inventory? Poor fellow would've starved in there. <br />
I want to keep my keyring :(.</div></div><hr />

Sure, we have more bag space now, but we also have more stuff to lug around as well. Now with all those keys clogging the bagspace? Yeah, good idea Blizz. Supposedly they are removing the keys needed for things like Heroic BC instances and Kara, but even then, it still seems like a bad idea (I also don't like the idea of having just anyone be able to run those dungeons without any effort at all. I like semi-gated content, it rewards the players who decide to work for something rather than whine about not having anything).</div></div><hr />

Remove the TBC heroic keys, just unlock it by gear level like Cata heroics. <br />
<br />
Remove the Kara portcullises so you can just go in.<br />
<br />
Remove the EoE key, anyone can start it.<br />
<br />
that sohuld be most of the keys</div></div><hr />

It's like the devs all got together and said: <br />
<br />
&quot;what can we change to make it look like we are trying to make improvents, but really should only take 15 minutes to do. I got it, let's remove something that has no impact on current content for no apparent reason or obvious improvement.&quot;<br />

<br />
our bags are bigger now, lets fill them with junk , thanks alot blizzard.<br />
<br />
you give us a wonderful storage option years ago to clear the clutter in our bags and now you FORCE players into buying larger bags if they dont have them and then you put us into a position where we are taking up the little storage resources that we have available once more.<br />
<br />
doing something good? im surprized you can all breathe with where youve shoved your heads.<br />
<br />
lets face it people have dual specs now some players carry 2 sets of gear for those sets in bags plus pvp gear , some players that RP carry RP gear<br />
<br />
banks for some players are filled with world event items and items that we wouldnt want to throw away like old tier sets , weapons that we were excited to get<br />
<br />
now we have to hold keys again because you think its not needed?<br />
<br />
now lets talk about players that cant afford new bags that have limited storage space, they have a more limited amount of space thanks to you.<br />
<br />
If your going to get rid of the keyring get rid of keys altogether thats the only sollution<br />
<br />
AND GIVE US OUR KEYMASTER FOS! goodness I was so irked I spent the time to get all those keys only to lose the achievement points and not gain a FoS.</div></div><hr />

<br />
how about extra bag space as soon as they take away the keyring...... not extra bag space some time in the future. because in the meantime that blizzard would be dragging their butts implementing this OMG AWESOME new feature that needed a millimeter of space on the UI that the key ring took up... we will have lost a lot of inventory space in either our bags, or bank because blizzard needs to free up space that they don't need to use just yet???</div></div><hr />
