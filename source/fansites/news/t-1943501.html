Legion - Turtle Mount<br />
A recent Legion build added a Turtle mount!<br />

Blue Tweets<br />
whats with all the minor glyph removals?<br />
The glyph system is being updated, so a lot of data is changing. Many of those effects will still be available. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/692483968726335494))<br />
<br />
<br />
Ghostcrawler Tweets<br />
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br />
Do you still play World of Warcraft?<br />
I don't, but I am always hesitant that when I say that, for fear players will somehow try to use it to argue for their own agenda.<br />
<br />
Here are my reasons:<br />
<br />
1) As a player, I needed a break. I had played WoW for nearly a decade without a break, with a lot of heavy raiding. I fully expect I will go back at some point.<br />
<br />
2) As a developer, I needed a little distance. WoW was part of my DNA for many years. Jumping back into the game felt like cruising by the house of my ex all the time and asking her how her current BF was treating her, and maybe giving him some pointers on how to handle her. It just felt weird. It has been two years, so that has mostly dried up.<br />
<br />
3) As a designer, I needed more broad exposure. When I played WoW, it was harder to find time to play other games. (Blizzard now has so many games, that they make it really hard to play non-Blizzard games too!) When I interviewed at Riot, I struggled with answering some questions because I hadn't played all of the games I should have. I vowed to keep more abreast of the industry and not make WoW (or LoL!) my only game.<br />

Legion - Fishing Artifact<br />
A recent build also added several versions of the fishing artifact (http://beta.wowdb.com/artifact-calculator#9AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA) used out in the world for display purposes.<br />

If anything, Legion is going to have far more variety in terms of player weapons compared to any expansion before.<br />

People thought it was going to be a Monk weapon? eh?<br />

There was clearly only two choices, Rogue &amp; Warrior the main users of it back in the day, Considering that it has Agility it really points towards Rogue which is what they've gone with.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The reasoning behind Rogue and Monk is based on the filename for the icons, skywall, which is used for Rogue and Monk artifacts. Warrior had already been eliminated as a choice based on that.</div></div><hr />

The thunder-fury look alike artifact was marked for warriors &amp; rogues since the beginning; sadly rogues get the cherry this time, but no lame ass monk will claim right in this even for an icon name<br />

<br />
On Thunderfury? Still isn't confirmed for Rogue, that's just MMO-C file naming for their upload?<br />
<br />
Not that I bother with it either way, just Monk still seems *possible* given their Windwalker artifact being described with &quot;Al'Akir poured unspeakable amounts of raw elemental fury into the handblades (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/blog/19940943/legion-monk-artifact-reveal-10-23-2015),&quot; which relates to Thunderfury in origin.<br />

I'd rather see people stop whining about reskins when the thing they're talking about is a remodel.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1: Ashbringer.<br />
2: Artifacts that cry themselves to sleep because they are not Ashbringer.<br />
<br />
I don't see why they would cry since almost all of them are better looking and more interesting than Ashbringer.<br />
<br />
Granted this new &quot;corrupted&quot; skin helps a lot.</div></div><hr />

You clearly underestimate the power of a human males gorilla wrists.</div></div><hr />

His input isnt valuable, its irrelevant. He left the game when it needed him the most, and it shows. <br />
<br />
Better question is &quot;why do you care what people think of Greg Street?&quot; Our opinions dont matter to you, so dont comment on them. No one cares how much you love him.</div></div><hr />

I don't love him, His input is valuable. I'm just tired of the same 15 comments every post whinging about having to see Ghostcrawler tweets.</div></div><hr />
