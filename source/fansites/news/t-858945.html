Patch 4.0.6 Hotfixes - February 25<br />
Another wave of hotfixes has been deployed on live servers, apparently Blizzard decided to nerf a couple of raid encounters. <br />
Here you'll find a list of hotfixes that address various issues related to the recently released World of Warcraft: Cataclysm patch 4.0.6. Hotfixes are updates we make on our end without requiring you to download a new patch. Some of the hotfixes below will go live the moment they are implemented, while others may require your realm to be restarted to go into effect. Please keep in mind that some issues cannot be addressed without a client-side patch update. We will continue to update this thread in the days ahead as additional hotfixes are applied. Visit our Bug Report forum for a list of 4.0.6 known issues.<br />

Blue Posts<br />
I missed a couple of blue posts because of the PTR, let's not waste precious class information! <br />
Patch 4.1 and beyond<br />
We have more in store even past patch 4.1 and we'll be sharing more details about them before much longer. We'll also be sharing a more complete look at Zul'Gurub and Zul'Aman (including the updated mounts.) Though, testing on the PTR will get you a look at it more up front and personal.<br />
<br />
We are not near the &quot;end&quot; of things in World of Warcraft nor at the &quot;end&quot; of our ideas. Development takes time though and we plan to make sure that experiences in game continue to be epic. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/160462/who-was-hoping-for-more))<br />

http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/idruids.gif Druid (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/270-Druid) / Cataclysm Talent Calculator (http://www.wowtal.com/#k=..druid) / Skills/Talents (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/1117-Druid-Cataclysm))<br />
Low Level Tanking<br />
We do think this is a legitimate concern. While we spend most of our fine-tuning at max level, we also want things to feel good at lower levels as well.The new bear AE rotation was based around Thrash, which is a high level spell. It works at high level, but without Thrash there is a lot of down time and it can be hard to AE tank. Since lower level dungeons don’t tend to be balanced on a razor’s edge, AE’ing is the norm, which can feel bad for lower level druids. We do think this is a problem and we’d like to address it at some point in time. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/160276/why-druids-are-frustrated))<br />
<br />
Feral PvP<br />
We’ve been over this issue quite a bit, but the core issue is that Ferals used to not have a lot of utility in PvP, but were also really hard to control. We watched as players told us over the years that they wanted more utility so that they could actually be a valuable member of their team, so we gave Ferals a lot of utility they didn’t have before, but in turn we thought it was fair to make them slightly easier to control. We realize there are a few different ways we could have gone on this and that some players would no doubt have preferred to keep the iconic ability to not be crowd controlled instead of gaining things like an interrupt and better crowd control of their own. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/160276/why-druids-are-frustrated))<br />
<br />
Bear threat<br />
We just don’t see this issue at level 85. All four of the tank classes seem to be performing well in both 5-player dungeons and in raids. We see all four tanks being used at a variety of levels. We just disagree that the difference is that obvious. Savage Defense might make bears take more damage on AE pulls in 5-player dungeons than other tanks, but we don’t think AE threat generation is a problem (again when in reference to max level). Bears don’t have an ability that mimics Shield Slam as a very hard-hitting ability that can help establish initial threat, but that is more of a raiding problem in encounters with frequent spawning adds and not really an issue with Swipe or Thrash.

Aspect Swapping<br />
Aspect swapping has come up quite a bit. In this thread, more than one of you expressed some annoyance with ‘sound spam’ generated by Aspect swapping. We're interested in addressing the concerns about sound spam, and as a matter of fact, we've been thinking about sound design quite a bit lately, and we’d like to emphasize sound design more in the future. For example, we'd like sound to serve more consistently as a gameplay cue. That strays away from the point, though, which is that we want there to be a trade off for hunters between standing still and doing more damage versus moving and doing less damage but getting mobility and potentially other benefits. For now, the best way to achieve that is via Aspects. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/160040/feb-18th-hunter-hotfixes))<br />
<br />
Freezing Trap<br />
Freezing Trap also came up quite a bit, in reference to multi-trapping. This ability was changed because we wanted hunters to be somewhat more consistent with the crowd control potential of other classes, and we didn't want any one class standing out as the absolute best at crowd control. We realize that it rewarded skill, and we like mechanics that do that. This wasn’t the right place for it though, and we think that hunters can be rewarding to skilled players in other ways.

<br />
There is no Rehashing here. Old Ironforge was something the was sadly removed during WoW's original Alpha, accessible only thro exploits. Finally they have added it here giving us some lore love. Btw everyone and their uncle whined when they announced that ZA and ZG were being removed. Now they have polished up the encounters, added new mechanics and brought it back (along with a Brand New Raid). When blizzard brought out Heroic Deadmines and SFK, the request everyone made was 'Can you bring back more old raids'. Blizzard has done exactly that.<br />
<br />
When they just take the old content and simply bump up the numbers and call it a day, then you can complain about recycling content. Not Now. I am getting sick and tired of people continuosly whining about every little thing that blizzard does :mad:</div></div><hr />

Perhaps you are just as sick as us old timers who have allready completed this crap for over a year! Bringing it back is nothing less than feeding the dog its own tail. Its even the same surroundings! They havent even updated neither the maps nor the textures of it! So stop pretending its something exciteingly new! The old Ironforge bit: Hoorah, truly nice if you play alliance a lot, then id be excited, but as I dont, for me it doesnt change anything.<br />
I have a hunch that it has only been opened becuase Blizzard could with little effort implement it.<br />
<br />
Its truly sad that we have come to this, all because the allmighty $$$ rules over innovative gamedevelopment.</div></div><hr />

Simple maths: if Blizzard can reuse old maps, add new bosses, and release it...they can then focus on doing something else as well. I mean adding TWO new 5 mans and TWO new raids in a content patch? That's pretty damn good, even if the 5 mans are reused old zones. Ultimately, its nothing to get worked up over. I'd rather have two redesigned zones then one brand zone.<br />
<br />
Now Raids are a bit different. They are the main focus for the end game. But I'd rather have well balanced and fun boss encounters then a pretty looking zone. Though obviously I'd prefer both!</div></div><hr />

Will be disappointed if it ends up just like the Ironforge Airfield, accessible but not particularly engaging.<br />
<br />
And as far as rehasing old content goes...<br />
Do they still make people pay for Vanilla, BC, and Wrath?<br />
Since the answer is yes, they should<br />
A) Balance the content<br />
B) Not remove content from those tiers<br />
<br />
Just my 2 cents.</div></div><hr />

Well, I'm getting sick and tired of people continuously backing Blizzard whatever they do, are you a fanboy? If they had kept the 60 raid version of ZG and added a 5 man as well, then most would have been happy. Why is SFK n DeadMines available for low levels and high levels at the same time but other content isn't? Oh, wait, we shouldn't ask questions like this, we should just think everything Blizzard does is great, like you do? Hell, they could make two seperate portals for the old n new, inside the old at the start they could add the old Zandalar NPCs n vendors. I mean, how hard can it be to please people? Just some small changes could go a long way!<br />
<br />

@Rehasing old content<br />
<br />
It is lame unless the entire place gets an overhaul with new textures and some models (enviroment), SFK and DM are just too 2005. If you truly believe that it is not a lot easier to put some bosses and mobs in an existing place rather than design a completely new one you are kidding yourself. <br />
<br />
Also the danger with it is that every time they rehash old dungeon content is that a potential great new one is lost in time and space.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh look, someone claiming fanboyism. Try to develop some brain first, let me explain:<br />
<br />
The new concept of Cataclysm is, and get this, moving on, evolution you know?! Keeping the old ZG is just as retarded as keeping old MC or BWL just for the sake of it. Did you even stop to think for a moment that the entire Azeroth is in a new time-frame except the dungeons? How the fuck that makes any sense? I wouldn't be bothered if they update the entire raids/dungeons for lvl 85. It was great some 6 years ago, but lets move the fuck on shall we? Why are people continuously bashing developers for giving them what people WANTED in the first place.<br />
First people complain Zg is being removed, now they complain they putting it back on, but with BETTER mechanics, new storyline and bosses, what the fuck is wrong with you people? Was ZG any fun before it got removed? Did you enjoy going there alone roflface the bosses and try to get a pair of mounts? How the fuck is that even comparable to what they are about to do? Haven't they done an amazing job with Deadmines and SFK? Haven't they done an outstanding job with the entire planet of Azeroth?<br />
<br />
THIS ISN'T A REHASH you morons! It's an update, there's a big fucking difference! Fanboyism? It's plain logic! Why throw away perfectly good content when you can UPDATE it to current times after being dead for 5 years? People have asked for old dungeons updates and revamps, and now you're giving them shit for what you asked.<br />

We just don’t see this issue at level 85. All four of the tank classes seem to be performing well in both 5-player dungeons and in raids. We see all four tanks being used at a variety of levels. We just disagree that the difference is that obvious. Savage Defense might make bears take more damage on AE pulls in 5-player dungeons than other tanks, but we don’t think AE threat generation is a problem (again when in reference to max level). Bears don’t have an ability that mimics Shield Slam as a very hard-hitting ability that can help establish initial threat, but that is more of a raiding problem in encounters with frequent spawning adds and not really an issue with Swipe or Thrash. (Source)<br />
<br />
Are blizzard seriously that stupid that they cant see that bear AE threat is worse and in general worse than other tanks sure i can keep up with them fine and 2nd on threat by a good margin if I want to its not hard but I dont know who blizz have been looking at. Also a good Idea would be to give a talent that or talent specialization that still allows rage to be generate whilst you are absorbing damage that would help in fights for me personally considering I raid with a Holy Preist and the absorbs not giving me rage really annoys the crap out of me</div></div><hr />

<br />
Over-dramatic much? Double-trapping in Vanilla was always a cool ability that also required very precise timing and good kiting skills to pull off (and considering the old resist rate on traps even in Survival, you were lucky to double trap). With Trap Launcher and Freezing Trap being much more reliable and lasting twice as long, double-trapping became WAAAY overpowered. I'm saying this as a Hunter who's been Survival since I rolled the toon 5 years ago because I loved trapping so much. And really, with Wyvern Sting working so well (ya, it was buffed in WotLK, but who needed to use it back then?) I haven't missed double trapping at all.<br />
<br />
As for why it wasn't announced...it was one wipe. Get over it. Hell, when they changed Distracting shot to not work with Misdirection in 3.0, which wasn't in the Patch notes, I wiped a 25-man group on High King Maulgar on the pull. We laughed about it, dusted ourselves off, and did it again. That is how you learn.</div></div><hr />

Updating old content and keeping the original versions is hands down the dumbest thing I've ever heard on the subject.<br />
<br />
And he didn't say that it didn't make any sense to keep them around because there's &quot;no reason to do them&quot;. It doesn't make sense because the outside lore has stepped forward. Nefarian and Onyxia are now dead and raised from the dead in current in-game lore. But then you zone into Onyxia's Lair or BWL and there they are alive and well. Current in game lore states we banished Ragnaros to the Firelands five years ago and now he's back with the help of Deathwing in Hyjal. But then you zone into Molten Core and there he is stuck in a time warp five years in the past. It's just dumb to keep the old raids and dungeons unchanged when the current expansion is entirely based around the fact that they were defeated years ago. <br />
<br />
Blizzard just can't win. Massive amounts of people have been complaining that Azeroth has been stuck in a time warp unchanged for six years, so they update the entire planet and now people are complaining that they're &quot;reusing old content&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not sure if this site can handle this much stupid... you want Blizz to continuously update old content for each major patch or at least every expansion? Have you stopped and thought that updating old content takes time n effort? It's not like they do it on an afternoon. That time is better suited for giving us new content.<br />
<br />
Maybe we should make Kael'Thas undead? Life was merely a setback :) Update all the old dungeons with him to suit that?<br />

This ability was changed because we wanted hunters to be somewhat more consistent with the crowd control potential of other classes, and we didn't want any one class standing out as the absolute best at crowd control. We realize that it rewarded skill, and we like mechanics that do that. This wasn’t the right place for it though, and we think that hunters can be rewarding to skilled players in other ways.<br />
<br />
Consistency? How is homogenizing the only non-targeted CC with a flight and arming time consistency? How is the only class with a minimum range consistency? Stop trying blizzard, we know you hate hunters already.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It comes from the book The Shattering, which Blizzard considers canon. Magni wanted to better understand why Azeroth was suffering, and an Earthen tablet was recovered that told him if he drank a potion and spoke the sacred words he would become &quot;one with the mountain.&quot; Unfortunately it was a literal translation and it turned him into crystal. This was all done in Old Ironforge to be closer to Azeroth's core so that they could better communicate.<br />

I don't think they'll have a quest hub, I think it's most likely going to be strictly a lore thing.</div></div><hr />

Perhaps you are just as sick as us old timers who have allready completed this crap for over a year! Bringing it back is nothing less than feeding the dog its own tail. Its even the same surroundings! They havent even updated neither the maps nor the textures of it! So stop pretending its something exciteingly new! The old Ironforge bit: Hoorah, truly nice if you play alliance a lot, then id be excited, but as I dont, for me it doesnt change anything.<br />
I have a hunch that it has only been opened becuase Blizzard could with little effort implement it.<br />
<br />
Its truly sad that we have come to this, all because the allmighty $$$ rules over innovative gamedevelopment.<br />

Nooo what happened to poor Magni! Damn them. <br />
Going to be nice to have it finally opened though. Now we just need the mysterious portal in Stormwind (and to be able to fly in Ghostlands)<br />
<br />
If you read the shattering you would know what happened, cool there putting some of the book into the game for those who didn't read it. WTB Tauren lore from the book pls :)</div></div><hr />

If they update old raids and bring them back then thats idiotic and lazy, if they dont thats idiotic and lazy. So in realising you are all gonna cry no matter what direction they take it in, they are trying to stear in the direction that brings them the least QQ. <br />
<br />
Personaly i love what im seeing so far for this patch and it will have me start playing this game again, ZOMFUCKINGGODBLIZZFANBOI111!!!, until i get bored again then ill take a break again until the next cool things come around. If you started to look at this for what its ment to be, something to relax and have fun with in your free time, insted of treating it as your whole life you wouldent end up crying your loungs out like a whiny brat every time blizzard did, or did not, make a change.<br />
<br />
All they did was reuse the suroundings and some of the lore from those instances becaus they were popular and clearly there was a demand for bringing them back, contrary to what a lot of you seem to think blizzard is a company trying to get as many customers as possible. Unless there was a demand for bringing it back they wouldent have, you might not want it but unfortunatly you are not the only person playing this game. I could maybe understand the complaints if this patch was revolving around brining back old instances and just renew and update them but it really dont. The Firelands is what this patch will revolve around and thats the main part, Ragnaros was banished and not defeated last time so you can come with all the setback jokes you like, they are completly void. In addition to that they are brining out some new 5mans, two of which uses the same zone and some of the lore from two previous raids. <br />
<br />
The amount of egomaniacs in this thread thats upset becaus the game is not made perfectly the way they imagin it should be is staggering.</div></div><hr />

I wouldn't be to surprised, go fly up to the top of Karazhan there's already a portal and a possible flight point there. <br />

It's always been there, from wowpedia:<br />
<br />
<br />
The Karazhan gryphon roost is leftover from the planning phase of Karazhan. Before the teleport to Aran's room was implemented, the original plan was to have a flightpath that connected to the top of Karazhan for the convenience of groups who had already cleared most of the instance</div></div><hr />

So has Old ironforge. Just cause something has been there doesnt mean they will never use it and it doesnt have to be connected to the old dungeon if they do decide to use it.<br />
<br />
Not saying its new or old im just saying that with all the remade stuff this xpac i wouldn't be surprised if we see this used in the future. <br />
<br />
Will they? who knows. <br />
<br />
One more point and then i am done here, they took out allot of other old unused stuff (The unused parts of the cancelled Desolace BG, and Tauren farm behind silthus come to mind of unused stuff that was removed) with the world remake aka Cataclysm just a theory but why wasn't this removed.<br />
<br />
Again who knows for sure just kinda odd is all.</div></div><hr />

What's stopping you? Stormwind is a stupid city and I don't like it, I have my hearthstone set in Ironforge, and if I need to get to the earthshrine I just autofly to SW while being tabbed out.<br />
And regarding rehashing content, what's wrong with updating old places? Just like they did with most of the zones in Cataclysm anyway, you often see it in stories where people take residence in the previous hideouts of old villains.</div></div><hr />

You realise you have contradicted yourself, just to try and take a shot at Blizzard? By saying they started out in wrath, you must be referring to Naxxramas. Ulduar came out after Naxx. So your argument makes no sense. Quit being pessimistic for the sake of being pessimistic.</div></div><hr />

Meh i agree in what your saying about some of us have already done this but bliz will mix it up somehow and make it interesting. deadmines hc???

If they had kept the 60 raid version of ZG and added a 5 man as well, then most would have been happy. Why is SFK n DeadMines available for low levels and high levels at the same time but other content isn't? Oh, wait, we shouldn't ask questions like this, we should just think everything Blizzard does is great, like you do? Hell, they could make two seperate portals for the old n new, inside the old at the start they could add the old Zandalar NPCs n vendors. I mean, how hard can it be to please people? Just some small changes could go a long way!<br />
<br />
And i am getting sick and tired of people complaining about people backing Blizzard up for what they do. See the evil circle?<br />
Fanboy, pfft.. Worst statement currently existing in WoW, on the same level with &quot;wrathbaby&quot; and such terms. I think it speaks for itself; i do not have to express what is so obviously stupid about such statement.<br />
<br />
Try to follow me here ---&gt; there is no point at all in keeping level 60 raid instances in a transformed world. Actually, i'm shocked that they haven't revamped more dungeons to be tuned for level 85 heroics. While i agree that 5-man dungeons that have always been 5-man dungeons gets transformed - and therefore should have a low level version - does not have to apply to raid content. I wanna avoid having to put that sentence into context, so please don't force me to.<br />
<br />
That said, i understand again that touching ZA, a non-broken instance from TBC that clearly was good, yeah, a rewamp on good and evil can be discussed. But a level 60 raid instance? By this time, and taking it was so easy to faceroll in 80, i do not have to say how badly it would be to have implemented in cataclysm, since that's free mounts for everyone when it drops, in which, it will sometimes. We want people to work for thier loot, not send directly to thier mailbox, i presume? I suddenly would like to avoid that by any costs nessecary to avoid it.<br />
<br />
Again, i can't see why it should please anyone to have a raid they can solo in the means of less than 30 minutes, which i was already able too during patch 3.3 in full ICC 264 ilvl gear, with a few heroic 277 pieces. This would not have made it anywhere near different.</div></div><hr />

Now they have polished up the encounters, added new mechanics and brought it back (along with a Brand New Raid). When blizzard brought out Heroic Deadmines and SFK, the request everyone made was 'Can you bring back more old raids'. Blizzard has done exactly that.<br />

Arms overall dps will be higher and raging blow is kind of a burst attack (assume most class have 23% reduction on amour, not counting those opdins type that have around 40% reduction on amour). Warriors do get an extra battlemasters or commanding shout, w/e you call it.</div></div><hr />

It's funny to see how much of an addict you and all supporters of Blizzard recycling scenarios are, even to go to great lengths to write up long essays of quasi facts ignoring the real fact - no matter how much you sugar coat it - rehash, revamp, redesign, Venoxis spits different colour of different poison, woohoo, 'new mechanic' - it's same old crack and if you don't see that, wow ... I wouldn't want to be near you when reality bites on your addicted ass - eventually.<br />

Considering how little work it took them, its so that we can physically go down and see for ourselves what happened to Magni. I like this a lot, not only because it opens an area that when I was a noob exploited into, and the spot blew my mind in terms of layout and looks, but being able to see exactly what is happening with notable NPCs is a lot more enjoyable and engaging then the &quot;They Went On Vacation&quot; approach they generally take, where the NPC is just removed from the game with the preconceived notion that they are off doing somthing else.</div></div><hr />
