A Break in the Mists: Alert the Press!<br />
<br />
Since the announcement of World of Warcraft: Mists of Pandaria at BlizzCon 2011, we’ve been hard at work on all of the new game features, environments, dungeons, and other content that awaits adventurers. Today, we’re inviting members of the press worldwide to get an updated sneak peek and some hands-on time with the latest version of World of Warcraft’s fourth expansion at an event taking place March 13 - 15.<br />
<br />
If you want to know more about what lies hidden within the mists of Pandaria, wait for the season’s end….<br />

Resetting Cooldowns in PvP<br />
I think cooldown resetting is the definition of cheesy gameplay, it only promotes zerging and the game would be better off without it.<br />
<br />
Abilities that reset cooldowns create potential choices for classes to refresh their cooldowns on demand so that they can be reused; the timing on using this can often result in their victory or demise. Using them for simply zerging in and blowing all cooldowns twice will often not result in the best of outcomes as this can quite often be countered by your opponent.<br />
<br />
You have to remember that having an ability that resets cooldowns on demand such as Preparation, Cold Snap or Readiness does not make a class overpowered or provide them with a greater advantage over others. It is simply another part of their toolkit and it comes with an innate choice, &quot;Should I use it now or save it for later?” this adds an additional skill factor to their class. Do you pop it now to increase damage output and possibly secure that kill? Should you may maybe be save it just in case you need that second defensive cooldown or crowd control in a tight spot? Maybe you should wait until everything is finally on cooldown?<br />
<br />
Knowing when and where to use these abilities is a very difficult thing to be able to assess. These are the decisions that make or break and separate the good players from the great ones. Just because some classes can refresh their cooldowns on demand every now and then does not mean that the ability allowing them to do so is overpowered or needs to be changed in some way, it's simply another part of their class, as is the same for other abilities for anyone else.

There will be no 4.4. That would imply a whole new Cataclysm content patch. The Mists pre-event will likely be 5.0.1, just like Elemental Invasion was 4.0.1 and the Wrath pre-event was in 3.x</div></div><hr />

Considering you get Beta access with that annual pass, you could...I don't know, play the Beta while you wait? Oh yeah, and there's that whole free Diablo thing. Quit yer complaining.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">retpally</div><div class="date">2012-02-01, 10:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Lol the blues don't play competitive PVP. That response is solid proof. Given the massive amount of tools rogues and mages have, those classes would be a lot &quot;deeper&quot; without their free cooldown reset. If you mess up your first round of cooldowns, tough luck. Learn from your mistake and play better - that's what every other class has to do. Did someone trinket something? You've got like 4 other abilities on a decently short cooldown to CC them again. There's nothing skillful about resetting Ring of Frost, Smokebomb, Vanish, or Deep Freeze; it's a free pass to mess up. It's too much control given how powerful their damage is. Rogues and mages are plenty strong enough without such abilities.</div></div><hr />

And their PvE decisions/posts imply the opposite ?</div></div><hr />

7/8 Heroic DS isn't much more exciting. Heroic DW = most boring last boss ever?</div></div><hr />

Agreed x1000. They don't play their own game.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Leviatharan</div><div class="date">2012-02-02, 12:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Press release in 6 weeks? Yay, maybe they'll finally reveal the finished Death Knight, Hunter, Monk, Rogue, and Shaman trees/skills!</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alayea</div><div class="date">2012-02-02, 01:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There will be no 4.4. That would imply a whole new Cataclysm content patch. The Mists pre-event will likely be 5.0.1, just like Elemental Invasion was 4.0.1 and the Wrath pre-event was in 3.x<br />
So, so much this. As nit-picky at it may seem, using correct patch numbers is important. In fact, that reminds me that I still need to deal with some article inaccuracies on Wowpedia.org because some person(s) couldn't tell the difference between patch 4.0.1 and 4.0.3. -_-</div></div><hr />

The girl needs to relax. She's being way too stiff and trying to act like she's not. It doesn't hurt if you use your hand gestures from time to time, helps relax.</div></div><hr />

If you look aside from raids, there actually is something to do, like achieves and pets and mounts.</div></div><hr />

I do all that plus dungeons, level alts &amp; their professions, farm those last world-drop alchemy recipes for my main, dailies, maybe transmog another alt, sort through every character's inv/bank when it's housecleaning time, check the AH...<br />
<br />
I think I am insane.</div></div><hr />

Personally, I think it's most likely. But who really knows?</div></div><hr />
