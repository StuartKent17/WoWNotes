Recent In-Game Fixes - March 2010 - 03/26<br />
Listed below are recent fixes we have applied to the game. Keep in mind that some of these changes may not be active until after the realm has been restarted.<br />
<br />
03/26<br />
The Endless Healing Potion is no longer usable in arenas as intended.<br />
Warlock’s using a lower rank of Life Tap will receive a reduced benefit from their shadow spell power.<br />
The damage done by the cannons in the gunship encounter in Icecrown Citadel has been increased and the rate at which their heat decays has been reduced.<br />
In Alterac Valley, the buffs that the Generals get from the Warmasters and Marshals now grant them negative enemy dodge. This means they will now ignore some of their target's total dodge percentage. The base health of the Generals has been increased and the buff also grants a slightly increased amount of damage and health.<br />
The cheese items in Dalaran as well as the Kvaldir Berserkers in Icecrown will once again respawn at a faster rate.<br />
The window that comes up when talking to an NPC should no longer close on its own.<br />
Some changes to the battleground queuing system have been made to improve performance and group queuing.<br />
The timer for when the next battle in Wintergrasp will occur should no long disappear.<br />

Gold cap in Cataclysm<br />
To answer your question though, increasing the gold cap is a definite possibility for Cataclysm -- though nothing is set in stone yet. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/23766996195-so-now-that-everyones-at-the-gold-cap.html))<br />

Eclipse<br />
The purpose behind Eclipse was to encourage Balance druids to cast something besides their hardest hitting spell over and over again. From this thread it appears at least some of you were content with a &quot;rotation&quot; like that, but you'll have to believe me that it was a very common complaint we heard from druids as to what they disliked or why they didn't play Balance.<br />
<br />
Now it's possible to base a rotation around a single spells. Mages are designed to do just that. However, they also have a lot of procs, cooldowns, secondary effects and other situational events that mean that even though you're getting most of your damage from one button, you're managing a lot.<br />
<br />
We could have gone that way with Balance druids. We didn't largely because part of the kit of Balance is balance, and we thought that manifested itself nicely in switching between Arcane and Nature spells, or Starfire and Wrath, or Lunar and Solar.<br />
<br />
The problem with Eclipse (as I've stated many times, so I find the comments that we won't address the issue to be a trifle unfair) is that it now accounts for so much of Balance's damage that the random element can be punishing. Having to shift positions right when you get a proc should be a little bit of a bummer on the level of missing a few crits in a row, and not a devastating blow to your dps.<br />
<br />
We're keeping Eclipse, but the Cataclysm version is a pretty radical overhaul that we hope to be able to reveal soon. It removes a lot of the random element. :) (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/23767645949-moonkin--eclipse.html))<br />

Action Bar bug when rogues use Vanish while Shadow Dancing<br />
It's technically not a bug. It's just a limitation in how the bars work. Rogues essentially have 3 bars and there are just some technical reasons why we can't go back to the Shadow Dance bar once we've dropped it.<br />
<br />
I think the real solution is probably to make it so you can't / don't want to Vanish while dancing. I assume you're Vanishing to get out of roots or dodge spells, but we could solve those in other ways. The spell dodging part of Vanish has been so frustrating to rogues for so long that frankly I'd rather figure out another way to get the same functionality that would feel better all around and leave Vanish as strictly &quot;you want to go back into stealth.&quot; (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/23767196041-shadow-dance-bug-please-fix.html))<br />

Revenge and Unrelenting Assault<br />
We like Revenge on UA and we certainly like the new damage Protection can do with Revenge.<br />
<br />
If we make any change at all, it would probably be in the duration of the buff. Currently Revenge operates by giving the warrior 5 seconds in which to Revenge. This works fine when Revenge has a 5 sec cooldown, but UA removes that. Having no cooldown on Revenge is also probably fine if Revenge hits softly for Arms warriors, but it doesn't anymore. That allows a warrior who gets Revenge to light up to hit the button three or possibly four times in the window and do massive damage with each one. If we change Revenge to basically be one charge then the warrior can still pop the rogue or pet or whatever that triggers the block, dodge or parry, but they'd only get one hit instead of multiples. Such a change should not affect Protection at all. <br />
<br />
I can't believe all this QQ is getting a response from you. Popping shield block and revenge spaming as arms is not new at all.<br />
<br />
Nope. And it wasn't a big deal when Revenge didn't hit as hard as it does now. An alternative is to lower the damage Arms can do with Revenge, but we think in this case it's actually a better design that you can do one big Revenge per block / dodge / parry instead of a string of little ones. <br />
<br />
I could understand if you think warriors need some balancing but craving into fotm QQ disgusts me. Why are you soo quick to base nerfs off of the community's feedback but soo reluctant to buff them using their suggestions?<br />
Players often complain that we don't implement their suggested buffs or nerfs. This is nothing new. I suspect the volume of nerf posts exceed the buff posts because of the simple math that there are usually multiple classes asking for a nerf and one asking for a buff. We use player feedback to make informed decisions and we place more emphasis on intelligent or insightful points from players rather than a high-volume of low-quality QQ. &quot;Warrior hit me hard&quot; rage with perhaps an attached screenshot of dubious authenticity (tenacity vs. no resilience isn't uncommon) doesn't qualify as an intelligent or insightful point. :) (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/24038823780-probably-no-revenge-nerf-anytime-soon.html))</div></div><hr />

After the change just spamming '1' will not be viable since overheating gets punished more and people are encouraged to do it properly. Or that's how I read it.</div></div><hr />

well my warrior does 8-9k revenges and her gear is pretty standart (tier9 + heroic loot) so i believe the numbers. i just don't get why they nerf the warrior to the ground like that while retardins still roflstorm your face off.</div></div><hr />

while i have never whitnessed this behaviour and im totally up for increasing the difficulty of this encounter by 500% on normal and heroic mode, im certainly sure that those ppl, who couldnt grasp the concept of two buttons, will no even make this encounter even longer for you, as the gun will overheat from their 1 spam and thus do even less dmg</div></div><hr />

im still puzzled by that my self, the hole paladin class in pvp is so op ist pathetic but blizz refuse to nerf them instead they keep buffing them, rem a wsg run were there was a paly in prot spec using a mix of tank/dps and pvp gear, he was close to 1 shotting everyone, i was in tank spec + gear on that run, got about 40k unbuffed hp, he killed me in 3sec and still blizz is buffing them and nerfing warrs<br />
the only &quot;nerf&quot; thats incoming for paladins is a threat nerf for protadins, dont think they gona do anything else, blizz have proven that they love the bubble classes since most of the other ones bin nerfed hard</div></div><hr />

No they dont, revenge after this change can hit for some redicules numbers. A geared warrior can do 20-25k revenges. For example http://img704.imageshack.us/img704/2634/revengeisbalanced.png That would have hit a person outfitted with 1400 resi for 14k. I know that warrior got some very nice gear but the numbers can be pretty insane given the right gear.</div></div><hr />

Think arcane blast... Solar/Lunar eclipses stack to 3, and increase the damage of the other spell by such and such %. so you'd prob spam starfire x 3, wrath x3, starfire x3, wrath x3. lol<br />
or if say they aren't consumed like blast stacks, could turn firemage like... wrath wrath wrath starfire starfire starfire starfire starfire starfire starfire starfire wrath starfire starfire starfire starfire lol.<br />

We had our normal gunners on it and everything, both of which didn't know what was going on.

Seriously... Yea revenge does more damage in PvP now... Change it so that the window of opportunity closes after 1 revenge like with overpower and we'll all be happy.<br />
And whoever said that you can do 14k revenges on people with 1200 resi: how about you show us what you were hitting for that recount log. And what buffs you had, etc etc....</div></div><hr />

Eclipse<br />
The purpose behind Eclipse was to encourage Balance druids to cast something besides their hardest hitting spell over and over again. From this thread it appears at least some of you were content with a &quot;rotation&quot; like that, but you'll have to believe me that it was a very common complaint we heard from druids as to what they disliked or why they didn't play Balance.<br />
<br />
Now it's possible to base a rotation around a single spells. Mages are designed to do just that. However, they also have a lot of procs, cooldowns, secondary effects and other situational events that mean that even though you're getting most of your damage from one button, you're managing a lot.<br />
<br />
We could have gone that way with Balance druids. We didn't largely because part of the kit of Balance is balance, and we thought that manifested itself nicely in switching between Arcane and Nature spells, or Starfire and Wrath, or Lunar and Solar.<br />
<br />
The problem with Eclipse (as I've stated many times, so I find the comments that we won't address the issue to be a trifle unfair) is that it now accounts for so much of Balance's damage that the random element can be punishing. Having to shift positions right when you get a proc should be a little bit of a bummer on the level of missing a few crits in a row, and not a devastating blow to your dps.<br />
<br />
We're keeping Eclipse, but the Cataclysm version is a pretty radical overhaul that we hope to be able to reveal soon. It removes a lot of the random element. :) (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/23767645949-moonkin--eclipse.html))<br />

<br />
Good, my favorite spec is balance, and I have 2 maxed level druids (both with duel spec), yet I don't play balanced on either of them because of this talent point being required for most of a moonkins' damage. Because of the way that works, it almost makes playing a pvp moonkin impossible due to how much movement is involved in pvp. I wouldn't mind making it so if you crit with one magic school your next cast of the other magic school is instant (maybe at a reduced damage, or being unable to crit). That way you still get a balance of using both schools, and you have the mobility needed for pvp.</div></div><hr />

I believe what that guy/gal was saying was that it's theoretical to hit someone w/ 1200+ resilience w/ a 14k Revenge.<br />
The only possible way to do this was if the Warrior had full raid buffs and the pvp geared opponent had full debuffs. That ofcourse, seems extremely unlikely (maybe AV or Winterlag w/out Tenacity), the opponent would be long dead by the time all debuffs are up.<br />
<br />
So, calm down.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And stop whining about the gunship battle people were indeed spamming 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 and battle sometimes would take forever.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thats why the people who hit two always do 1k more dps as a gunship than the others, you can tell who does it.</div></div><hr />

Nerfing Gunship..... WOW.<br />
<br />
<br />
Quoting myself now... &quot;STOP QQING about the gunship change. This wasn't a nerf it was a bug fix. My 10 man normally finishes gunship in two (three at the most) freeze phases. Last night it took us about 12. Halfway through the fight I started asking over vent why the #$%* the other gunship wasn't dead yet. <br />
<br />
We had our normal gunners on it and everything, both of which didn't know what was going on. And this isn't some stupid pug group that has issues with Marrowgar, we normally one shot the first 8 bosses (though it is a casual 10 man, running only once a week), this was a needed bug fix unless of course you enjoy being forced into an eternity of hell where you do the gunship battle for the rest of your life.&quot; Seriously, it was a bug fix NOT a nerf.</div></div><hr />

I did 2 heroic 10m gunships and a 25m gunship this week, we NEVER had any issues with the battle taking 5 times as long as it should have.<br />
<br />
I'd suggest you switch out your gunners with people who can handle hitting 2 buttons instead of just mashing '1' forever.</div></div><hr />

Perfect example, ladies and gents:<br />
Armory shows you having never defeated either version... Now armory might could be wrong. But mostly, you are a trolling loser. Now go check mine and reassess the odds that we wiped on gunship.<br />
<br />
No, it did't make the fight harder. Esp because I am almost certain that the opposing gunship suffered the same problem (you seemed to take far less damage to your ship, but don't quote me.) It just made it go twice as long and half as fast. It's a bug fix, not a nerf.<br />
<br />
I'd say &quot;so don't flap your mouth if you have no idea what you are talking about&quot;, but we know that is a hopeless wish on these forums.</div></div><hr />

LOL<br />
Blizzard has been nerfing the Warrior class ALL of Wrath.<br />
Remember when Juggernaught used to be an automatic crit? (lol now its 25%)<br />
How about when they nerfed Warbringer for Prot. Used to be able to charge out of roots/snares*.(lol, not any more)<br />
How about since recently, bladestorm can be disarmed. (lolol 51 POINT TALENT BUDDY)<br />
Now inc revenge nerf.<br />
And this is just off the top of my head.<br />
The nerf bat has been deep in our ass for a while.<br />
You'd think that if a class is so healing dependant, it would be acceptable for it to have extra offensive abilities.</div></div><hr />
