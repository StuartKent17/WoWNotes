Patch 8.1 - Mythic Zul: 5% Health Nerf<br />
Blizzard is hotfixing Mythic Zul to reduce his health by 5% to compensate for the removal of Shuriken Combo (https://www.wowdb.com/spells/245639-shuriken-combo).<br />

Are you kidding me, you people whined because it was the reverse for arathi... You will have the first quest for ilvl 385+ or 390+ item when you take the warffront while the horde will have to wait 2 weeks, so stop complaining, you persecution complexed psycho !!</div></div><hr />

Wakandalar has a nice ring to it.<br />

On another note, and I may be showing my age here, but who else saw the opening seconds of the video and immediately noticed this was a role reversal of the Warcraft II: Tides of Darkness intro cinematic?</div></div><hr />

You are a special kind of miserable person. &quot;I want something new!

Everything that is not Legion inherited is a game design failure. Dull, pointless and unrewarding Islands and Warfronts. Azerite is universally disliked for its clunky, unclear, rng, unexciting, grindy nonsense. Classes feel worse than any of the past three expansions with boring rotations and often a choice between fun or viable talents.</div></div><hr />

Uh, he's not the only one who dislikes all that stuff. You obviously haven't been keeping up. This expansion so far is a major letdown. Even a couple of my friends who are really hardcore with Warcraft lore and WoW gave up on this expansion. I was shocked when I heard one of them say, &quot;Meh, over it&quot; when the game was mentioned to him. He'd never reacted towards WoW that way before and we've been playing together since Vanilla.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They don't inject the game with jargon for the sake of pushing a political narrative and in-fact, yes they do quite often poke fun at the ridiculous radicalism and today's sensationalism. WoW has always been a game that was choc-full of cultural references and clearly attentive of the world outside of World of Warcraft. It's subtle, but it's there and I enjoy it. <br />
<br />
When a game doesn't force these political narratives as BioWare and several other developers seem to be dead-set on implementing from their bubble of ignorance and failure -- and has fun with it's audience, it breeds what we have in WoW and I pray that never changes. Nevertheless, even if it's not perfectly clear that they are or are not catering to the most pathetic vocal minority of our lifetime -- then my point is proven.</div></div><hr />

The mother of all mages? What? If there was such a thing it would be Aegwyn. It also doesn't explain where she got it. The thing was a project that antonidas started but never finished. The prototype fragments were held by various mage deciples and collegues of his and none of them were jaina. Antonidas never could finish it because he had no means to deal with the powers at play. We went to the eye of eternity and had the former aspect of magic help us craft the disc finally. With our artifact weapon.<br />
<br />
I mean sure, maybe Kalec was bored made Jaina one too, or you just stop sniffing jaina's farts and realize that Blizzard is being lazy and resuses assets they should not be reusing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Same issue here: everyone I know gave up on WoW. First half on Legion because they couldn't stand the grind, and everyone else on BfA because it was just so plain dull, boring and uninspiring. <br />
<br />
According to the monthly active user numbers Blizzard released recently you can make an estimated guess that about 3 million people are left playing. That is still a lot for an MMO these days, but considering where we came from you can say that WoW is slowly bleeding out.</div></div><hr />
