Fixed a bug that sometimes allowed the leech from Soul Rending to persist after Metamorphosis ended.<br />

Freezing Trap will no longer cause the target's next cast to fail in certain cases.<br />

Ice Block's cooldown will correctly reset at the end of an encounter.<br />

<br />
You can now activate and deactivate Shadowform while mounted.<br />
<br />
<br />
Class Halls<br />
<br />
Players who were unable to submit Artifact Knowledge Work Orders should now be able to again.<br />
<br />
<br />
Dungeons and Raids<br />
<br />
Players in a dungeon during a server shutdown should no longer receive the Deserter debuff.<br />
<br />
<br />
Throne of Tides<br />
<br />
Fixed a bug that was causing Mindbender Ghur’sha to be non-interactable.<br />
<br />
<br />
Trial of Valor<br />
<br />
The Patient Zero achievement should now be obtainable, as intended.<br />
<br />
<br />
Guarm<br />
<br />
Increased the radius of Guarm's Multi-Headed from 8 yards to 30 yards on Mythic difficulty.<br />
Decreased Guarm's health by 5% on Mythic difficulty.<br />
<br />
<br />
Developers’ Notes: The Mythic difficulty change to the Multi-Headed mechanic is intended to require the use of 2 tanks on the encounter. We also slightly reduced Guarm’s health alongside this change in order to minimize the effect on groups that were accustomed to only using 1 tank. This is already active in the NA/ANZ region, and will take effect in other regions with their weekly restarts.<br />
<br />
Helya<br />
<br />
The magnitude of Corrupted Axion's healing absorb now properly scales down as the size of a raid decreases from 30 players to 10 players.<br />
Resolved an issue that would cause Fetid Rot from targeting more players than intended on non-Mythic difficulties.<br />
Reduced the health of several enemies in the Helya encounter on Normal and Heroic difficulties.<br />
On non-Mythic difficulties, Adjusted Orb of Corrosion no longer targets Helya's tank targets, similar to its behavior in Mythic difficulty.<br />
<br />
<br />
Odyn<br />
<br />
Fixed an issue that could cause Odyn to sometimes cast a lethal Unerring Blast during the final phase of the encounter.<br />
<br />
<br />
Items<br />
<br />
Many trinkets available from Timewalking holiday dungeons and vendors have had their effects adjusted to more closely match the power level of Legion trinkets.<br />
<br />
<br />
Player versus Player<br />
<br />
Mass Invisibility can no longer be cast on allies holding battleground flags and orbs.<br />
<br />
<br />
Quests<br />
<br />
Havi's message when a player completes &quot;Now That's Just Clawful&quot; will no longer be displayed to all players in the area.<br />
World Quest map markers for Kirin Tor World Quests should now function correctly.<br />
During “Barrels o’ Fun”, a swirling holy light now radiates from the barrel that needs to be tracked.<br />
Players no longer get roadblocked if they teleport out of Well of the Forgotten after interacting with the Bone Pile for the quest &quot;The Rite of the Executioner&quot;.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Patch 7.1.5 - Emerald Dreamcatcher Changes<br />
We want to reduce the overall strength of the The Emerald Dreamcatcher (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/137062-the-emerald-dreamcatcher), but agree that removing the “Surgeweaving” playstyle it allows isn’t ideal. So, we’re going to take a different approach. Instead of adjusting the buff’s duration, we’re going to reduce the Astral Power cost reduction to 7 per stack (down from 10). This should allow you to continue the playstyle of weaving spells in-between Starsurges, but still lower the gap between players who have the Emerald Dreamcatcher and those who don’t.<br />
<br />
<br />
Patch 7.1.5 - Shadow Priest Changes<br />
To clarify on the 18 seconds thing: The changes to Insanity drain are obviously an overall nerf to Surrender to Madness. That's intentional. We just disagree that it is proportionately more of a problem for lower-skilled players. If you weren't pushing Surrender past 100 stacks already anyway, the difference for you won't be as substantial. If anything, those players are likely to see an increase in duration of their non-Surrender Voidforms.<br />
<br />
That said, there's obviously a lot changing for Shadow in 7.1.5, and once things stabilize, we intend to take another look at the rate of Insanity drain to make sure things end up where they should be.<br />
<br />
Couple other notes for you:<br />
<br />
We're planning to increase Void Bolt's DoT extension to 3 seconds, up from 2.<br />
We're also increasing Shadow's damage across the board in the next build.<br />
<br />
<br />
Having to recast dots in void form wouldn't be SO (still awful but meh) bad if we didn't have to die during STM lol.<br />
The intent is that, within reason (e.g. you didn't go into Voidform with 1 second left on your DoTs, or forget to actually cast Voidbolt), you can keep your DoTs active during Voidform without having to re-cast them. <br />

Why bother fixing this this far into the tier? Seems silly.<br />
<br />

<br />
Reduced the health of several enemies in the Helya encounter on Normal and Heroic difficulties.<br />
<br />
And I wonder if this is over and beyond the previous nerfs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
already done the math on it etc. you will if done perfect rotation throw 8 starsurges before it goes down. <br />
<br />
IFE is 10kish dps ahead of the helmet. so we have a new BiS legendary.<br />
<br />
100 -&gt; 100, 60<br />
60 -&gt; [75], 42<br />
42 -&gt; [62], 36 -- New Moon used in placed of SW<br />
36 -&gt; [56], 30 -- Half Moon used in place of LS<br />
30 -&gt; [50], 24<br />
24 -&gt; [39], 13<br />
13 -&gt; [33], 07<br />
07 -&gt; [22], end<br />
<br />
Result: No change. Assumes BOTA and no CA/INC.<br />
<br />
credit goes to Cyoaz with the math. Thank you Druu ;D</div></div><hr />

More haste needed to compensate for the 3 AsP loss. Overall just fewer SS casted. Hope they buff some spells too, since Recount doesn't discriminate between ED and nonED boomkins. We want to lower the distance between chickens and the rest, not between chickens and chickens.. damn chickens, they ruined Moonglade.</div></div><hr />

Maybe because they weren't satisfied with completion rates of the encounter? At the moment wowprogess lists mythic guarm kills as done by 261 guilds (0.58% total). <br />
<br />
Anyway I think they just earned gratitude of every mythic guild that didn't have fotm druid tank at their disposal. <br />
<br />
<br />
And I wonder if this is over and beyond the previous nerfs. It's a lot it seems, the hotfix went already live last Thursday (was a tweet about it) and I was looking into logs of a guild I know and 1 week before the nerf they were wiping a lot on hc Helya and this Thursday they 1 shot it, so I expect it's significantly easier. Unfortunately my guild killed her on Wednesday pre-hotfix so need to wait until tomorrow reset (EU here) to see it with my own eyes.</div></div><hr />

You're ok with the quest completely bugging out and not highlighting a barrel so that you have to randomly click a barrel and hope it's the right one no matter what?<br />
<br />
They didn't change the quest, they fixed the highlight mechanic because IT WAS BUGGED.</div></div><hr />

Oh, you have been waiting for 10 years to have your only damage spec fixed too? No? Come back when you did....</div></div><hr />

<br />
I cant understand how can balance be so difficult. If one spec-class is doing as much damage as it should just increase its dmg. Sure, not all specs have the gameplay but arent we all suppose to do the same amount of dmg?</div></div><hr />

All those crying over SPriest should try to roll one, struggle 5 days on dummies with s2m and crawl back to their boring fucking &quot;rotation&quot; cave.</div></div><hr />
