Here are the relevant parts of the Gamespot news, check their site for the Full Version (http://www.gamespot.com/pc/rpg/worldofwarcraft/news.html?page=1&amp;sid=6174183&amp;part=rss&amp;tag=gs_all_games&amp;subj=6174183)<br />
<br />
&quot;Zul'Aman is a smaller raid dungeon that's better suited for 10-character parties than the full-on 25-character raids that some of the game's larger dungeons demand. Because the dungeon will not require any keys or attunements to enter, the dungeon seems intended to be more accessible to players on tight schedules. Much of the layout will call for methodical clearing of troll enemies who may call for help by beating on nearby war drums, which summon additional trol warriors to fight. Each of the four avatars, which have respectively been infused with the spirits of a bear god, a dragonhawk god, a lynx god, and finally, a god of evil, may also summon help as well as assume different forms over the course of battle. Once players have defeated each avatar, they'll eventually take on the witch doctor who started the whole mess, and finally do battle with Zul'Jin himself. The final troll boss will not only be a powerful foe; he'll also be able to draw upon the ghostly spirits of each of the four liberated animal gods and change his own shape to assume their powers.<br />
<br />
In addition to offering challenging encounters against these mighty foes, Zul'Aman is also apparently intended to encourage players to tackle it repeatedly to master its content. There will be several characters hanging around just outside the dungeon to give out quests that take place within the dungeon, including hunting for treasure and liberating four different hostages who have been taken captive by the armies of each of the four avatars. The rescue missions will apparently be timed and will yield better rewards if completed early.<br />
<br />
Blizzard also plans to release additional, smaller patch updates before then that will add two new features: integrated voice chat and guild banks. Voice chat will be added to the game free of charge, will mute the game slightly whenever someone talks (so that you won't need to talk over any onscreen battles), and will use onscreen icons to indicate who's saying what, so that you'll be able to quickly determine which team member in your party is asking for help. The guild banks, on the other hand, will let guild officers create vaults to store the guild's entire possessions, as well as set permissions to limit access to certain items if they care to.&quot;</div></div><hr />

I did. We're on Kael'thas now, Karazhan was difficult in the beginning but nerf after nerf after nerf in different patches, and now... it's a fucking joke. We cleared the whole instance in 2h43m last week.<br />
<br />
Besides, i hate Blizzard for making arena items as good as they currently are and mor making them available that easy. At the end of season one, i saw many ppl with ratings like 1300 or so, at least 3/5 gladiator set and at least one weapon.</div></div><hr />

Come on man. We all can't raid 4 nights a week+, have time to farm consumables to beat highest content but we do want to have some fun and good gear. That's why it's just fair that they add easier raid instances (Karahzan, Zul'Aman) where we can enjoy endgame content too with smaller guild that has more laid-back players in it.. <br />
It's no problem for me that I'll propably never see Black Temple, Hyjal or even all bosses in TK: Eye, good that you hardcores have something to do aswell, but there has to be a balance; 8 million players play this game - not all of us are die hard raiders. <br />
This patch is for casual raiders, so what, last patch was for hardcore raiders.<br />
<br />
And about Arena - what would it make it enjoyable for the worster teams that still go there weekly just to lose 10+ games if rewards were any harder to obtain?? (ok, there could be something like blue arena gear but come on!)</div></div><hr />

<br />
So after months of raiding and seeing how fast you're clearing it all, you're probably fully decked in epics and you cry because someone else with a low rating who then also had done months of arena's has a total of 4 epics. Wow</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Falgorn</div><div class="date">2007-07-12, 10:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This got OT pretty fast.<br />
<br />
PvE Epics can come fast and easy if you group with the right people. PvP epics can simply be gotten more reliably but take time no matter what. Either way, Skill &gt; All so chill out.<br />
<br />
Zul'aman looks nice, but very similar to Zul Gurub. It's like they took the Troll areas in Hinterlands and mixed them with Zul Gurub to get this place. That said, Zul Gurub is still visually my all time favourite Instance in WoW so I shall refrain from Complaint. In game voice chat will be nice, esp with the slight mute effect. That said, I seldom pug now, with voice chat I will never do it. If it works in Battlegrounds you can forget it. Can you imagine all the screaming down vent in an Alterac Valley with all it's 14y/o generals running around. <br />
<br />
Guild banks worry me also. I hope the controls can be strict and transactions are logged. My current guild have a fine bunch of trustworthy Officers, but I can think of guilds I've previously been in and a Guild Banks would not have been suitable.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yea, I agree with this... in some ways. I am looking forward to this patch in particular because its for casual, smaller guilds that just wanna have fun. So I agree that its hard to get 1 of every class in here and have a good amount of tanks/healers... but some guilds really only have about 10-12 people that can raid weakly.... so it would make it hard to raid an instance like this a lot.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard made a huge gear difference between PvP Epics and PvE Epics with the use of High Stamina and the added Resilience, so I think it is silly for people to flip out that the PvP gear isn't that hard to come by. Me personally am raiding Black Temple and don't use any of the PvP Gladiator gear to PvE for the simple reason that the PvP. gear isn't that good for PvE</div></div><hr />
