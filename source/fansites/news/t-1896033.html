Welcome to our World of Warcraft: Legion class preview series. In this entry, we’re exploring the Priest—to find out what’s in store for a different class, check out the overview. <br />
<br />
We continue our early look at class and specialization design with the Priest. In these blogs, we’ll be exploring class identity, discussing Legion’s new designs, and presenting core combat abilities for each specialization—laying out the foundation upon which talents and Artifacts will build further. With that in mind, let’s delve into what it means to be a Priest in World of Warcraft.<br />
<br />
Priests have a strong identity as spiritual practitioners who harness divine power to inspire and protect allies, heal the injured, and cure the ailed. But while this clearly holds true for Holy Priests, these ideas are less fundamental to Discipline Priests—and the ideals and beliefs of Shadow Priests are antithetical to those of Holy Priests.<br />
<br />
Despite these differences, Priests of any spec share one key thing in common: unwavering faith in something from which they draw great power. What delineates specializations is the source of that power. In Legion, we’re going to explore that dichotomy in greater depth than ever through the gameplay for each specialization.<br />
<br />

<br />
Holy<br />
After spending much of their lives in temples studying ancient doctrine, preaching the tenets of their faith, and pledging their full devotion to the divine powers they follow, the most adept priests leave their houses of worship to serve on the battlefield, as shepherd to flock. There, they use their holy powers to bless allies and mend wounds. And while most stay behind the frontlines to aid their comrades, these holy champions are also capable of smiting foes and carrying out sacred justice. They’re also morally opposed to the use of Shadow and Void magic—rather, they are exemplars of the incredible grace and power of the divine and the Light, and even death cannot fully stop their healing capabilities. <br />
<br />
&quot;The most adept priests leave their houses of worship to serve on the battlefield, as shepherd to flock&quot;<br />
<br />
Gameplay<br />
Given the innate purity of the spec, we want to ensure that Holy Priests continue to have a large repertoire of compelling healing spells. The Chakra system was cumbersome, requiring additional setup to optimally use most spells and restricting how much you could fluidly shift between healing methods. We have removed it in favor of a more dynamic play style focused around Holy Words. New Holy Word spells are designed to feel absolutely miraculous, having huge effects balanced with long base cooldowns. The new passive effect of Serendipity allows those long base cooldowns to be reduced, letting you use them more frequently. Finally, in keeping with the resolute beliefs of the Holy Priest, they can make no use of Shadow spells. Smite, Holy Fire, and Holy Word: Chastise are the instruments used by Holy Priests to inflict damage upon their enemies.<br />
<br />
Here’s a basic look at the core combat healing abilities for Holy Priests:<br />
<br />
<br />
Heal<br />
<br />
2.0% Mana, 40 yd range, 2.5 sec cast<br />
A slow but efficient spell that heals an ally for a moderate amount.<br />
<br />
<br />
Flash Heal<br />
<br />
3.5% Mana, 40 yd range, 1.5 sec cast<br />
A fast but expensive spell that heals an ally for a moderate amount.<br />
<br />
<br />
Holy Word: Serenity<br />
<br />
4.0% Mana, 40 yd range, Instant, 1 min cooldown<br />
Perform a miracle, healing an ally for an absolutely massive amount.<br />
<br />
<br />
Prayer of Healing<br />
<br />
8.0% Mana, 40 yd range, 2.5 sec cast<br />
A powerful prayer that heals up to 5 injured allies within 15 yards of the target for a strong amount.<br />
<br />
<br />
Prayer of Mending<br />
<br />
2.0% Mana, 40 yd range, 1.5 sec cast, 10 sec cooldown<br />
Places a spell on a party or raid member that heals them for a moderate amount the next time they take damage. When the heal occurs, Prayer of Mending jumps to another party or raid member within 20 yds. Jumps up to 5 times and lasts 30 sec. after each jump.<br />
<br />
<br />
Holy Word: Sanctify<br />
<br />
5% Mana, 40 yd range, Instant, 1 min. cooldown<br />
Release miraculous light into a target location, healing up to 6 allies within 10 yards for a huge amount.<br />
<br />
<br />
Renew<br />
<br />
2.5% Mana, 40 yd range, Instant<br />
Fill the target with faith in the Light, healing them instantly for a minor amount and then a large amount over 15 sec.<br />
<br />
<br />
Serendipity<br />
<br />
Passive<br />
When you cast Flash Heal or Heal, the cooldown of Holy Word: Serenity is reduced by 6 sec.<br />
When you cast Prayer of Healing or Prayer of Mending, the cooldown of Holy Word: Sanctify is reduced by 6 sec.<br />
When you cast Smite or Holy Fire, the cooldown of Holy Word: Chastise is reduced by 6 sec.<br />
<br />
<br />
Mastery: Echo of Light<br />
<br />
Your direct healing spells heal for an additional 25% (with Mastery from typical gear) over 6 sec.<br />
<br />
Additionally, to give you an idea of how some talents may build upon this, here’s an example of one of their Holy-specific talents:<br />
<br />
Apotheosis<br />
<br />
Instant, 3 min cooldown<br />
Enter a pure Holy form for 30 sec, increasing the effects of Serendipity by 200%.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Shadow<br />
The Light in which many priests bathe is brilliant and effervescent, granting them immense divine power. But the brightest light casts the darkest shadow—and from within this blackness, a rival power dwells. Shadow priests fully embrace this opposing polarity, their faith equally resolute as their holy counterparts—but focused on shadowy magics and mental manipulation. Like all priests, they dedicate much of their lives to worship—but they derive their power from the Void, straying dangerously close to the domain of the Old Gods. To truly understand such ancient, corruptive influence is to be driven mad. This is the state in which these dark priests thrive, embracing insanity and feeding off of the minds of their opponents to reach terrifying new limits. <br />
<br />
&quot;These dark priests thrive, embracing insanity and feeding off of the minds of their opponents to reach terrifying new limits&quot;<br />
<br />
Gameplay<br />
We’ve long alluded to the Old God influences of Shadow Priests in their spells and abilities, and we’re making that more distinct in Legion.<br />
A new resource, Insanity, provides a better fit for Shadow, having more granularity and gameplay that emphasizes the immense but fleeting power that the Void offers. Mind Blast, Shadow Word: Pain, and Vampiric Touch will build Insanity. Reaching maximum Insanity will transform Shadowform into Voidform, giving the Shadow Priest access to stronger Void magic, but it is unable to be maintained indefinitely. This should make for interesting gameplay as Shadow Priests try to maintain the height of their Insanity as long as possible to prey on the minds of their enemies.<br />
<br />
While not under the effects of Insanity, Shadow Priests continue to rely heavily on abilities that inflict sustained damage over time. Finally, having turned away from the Light, Shadow Priests eschew such spells as Heal, Flash Heal, and Prayer of Mending. Power Word: Shield and Shadow Mend are their primary healing tools.<br />
<br />
<br />
Voidform<br />
<br />
Passive<br />
When you reach 100 Insanity, you enter Voidform, transforming your Mind spells into Void spells, and increasing your Shadow damage by 30%.<br />
While in Voidform, you gain 2% Haste every 1 sec. This Haste will also persist for 20 sec after Voidform ends.<br />
Voidform causes your Insanity to constantly drain, faster and faster, until completely drained, and Voidform ends.<br />
<br />
<br />
Mind Flay<br />
<br />
40 yd range, Channeled<br />
Assault the target’s mind with Shadow energy, causing minor Shadow damage over 3 sec and slowing their movement speed by 50%.<br />
While in Voidform, transforms into Void Flay, which also extends Shadow Word: Pain by 3 sec.<br />
<br />
<br />
Mind Blast<br />
<br />
40 yd range, 1.5 sec cast, 9 sec cooldown<br />
Blasts the target’s mind for strong Shadow damage.<br />
Generates 15 Insanity.<br />
While in Voidform, transforms into Void Blast, which has a 4.5 sec cooldown, and also extends Vampiric Touch by 3 sec.<br />
<br />
<br />
Vampiric Touch<br />
<br />
40 yd range, 1.5 sec cast<br />
A touch of darkness that causes huge Shadow damage over 24 sec, and heals the Priest for each point of damage dealt.<br />
If Vampiric Touch is dispelled, the dispeller flees in Horror for 3 sec.<br />
Each time Vampiric Touch deals damage, it generates 3 Insanity.<br />
<br />
<br />
Shadow Word: Pain<br />
<br />
40 yd range, Instant<br />
A word of darkness that causes minor Shadow damage instantly, and an additional huge amount of damage over 18 sec.<br />
Each time Shadow Word: Pain deals damage, it generates 3 Insanity, and has a 10% chance to reset the cooldown of Mind Blast.<br />
<br />
<br />
Mastery: Madness<br />
<br />
Increases the damage and Insanity generation of your Mind Blast, Shadow Word: Pain, Vampiric Touch, and Shadow Word: Death by 20% (with Mastery from typical gear).<br />
<br />
Additionally, to give you an idea of how some talents may build upon this, here’s an example of one of their Shadow-specific talents:<br />
<br />
Oblivion<br />
<br />
Instant, 2 min cooldown<br />
Let the power of the void flow through you, instantly generating 100 Insanity.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Discipline<br />
Some priests pride themselves on pragmatism. They understand that light casts a shadow, that darkness is defined by light, and that true discipline stems from one’s ability to balance these opposing powers in services of a greater cause. While these priests possess many holy virtues to aid their allies, they also dabble in the dark arts to debilitate their enemies—always exercising immense discipline to keep themselves away from the brink of insanity. Many would say the ends justify the means; scriptures both virtuous and vile should be studied and understood to protect the congregation. <br />
<br />
&quot;True discipline stems from one’s ability to balance opposing powers in services of a greater cause&quot;<br />
<br />
Gameplay<br />
The power of absorption mechanics has created a gameplay issue for healers that we’re looking to address in Legion. Discipline Priests have been so effective in their role of preventing damage that it has sometimes left other healers yearning for an opportune time to throw out a clutch heal. To alleviate that issue, we’re tempering Discipline’s emphasis on shields in lieu of a reimaged Atonement mechanic.<br />
<br />
Discipline Priests are now more clearly defined by their use of both Holy and Shadow magic, and that extends to how they function in combat. Sacrificing a portion of healing ability and having a reduced focus on absorption spells, they gain a significant contribution in damage. Still filling a healer role in group content, they aim to strike a balance between healing allies and damaging enemies in a unique gameplay style. Discipline Priests have strong cooldowns with Power Word: Barrier and Pain Suppression, along with Rapture, a new cooldown that temporarily removes the cooldown of Power Word: Shield.<br />
<br />
Here’s a basic look at the core defensive and offensive combat abilities for Discipline Priests:<br />
<br />
<br />
Atonement<br />
<br />
Passive<br />
Plea, Power Word: Shield, and Shadow Mend also apply Atonement to your target for 15 sec.<br />
When you deal spell damage, you instantly heal all targets affected by Atonement for 50% of the damage done.<br />
Developer comment: Healing is not split between Atonements—the more allies you have Atonement on, the more total healing that a damage spell will cause.<br />
<br />
<br />
Mastery: Absolution<br />
<br />
Increases the healing transferred through Atonement by 28% (with Mastery from typical gear).<br />
<br />
<br />
Defensive<br />
<br />
Plea<br />
<br />
1.2% Mana, 40 yd range, Instant<br />
A quick, efficient plea to heal an ally for a minor amount.<br />
<br />
<br />
Shadow Mend<br />
<br />
3.0% Mana, 40 yd range, 1.5 sec cast<br />
Wrap an ally in shadows which heal them for a large amount, but at a price.<br />
The ally will take minor damage every 1 sec, until they have taken half that amount of total damage from all sources, or leave combat.<br />
<br />
<br />
Power Word: Shield<br />
<br />
3.5% Mana, 40 yd range, Instant, 6 sec cooldown<br />
Shield an ally, absorbing a large amount of damage. Lasts 15 sec.<br />
While the shield holds, spellcasting will not be delayed by damage.<br />
<br />
<br />
Power Word: Radiance<br />
<br />
7.0% Mana, 40 yd range, 2.5 sec cast<br />
A burst of light heals a friendly target and their 5 nearest allies for a moderate amount, and applies Atonement for 50% of its normal duration.<br />
<br />
<br />
Offensive<br />
<br />
Smite<br />
<br />
0.75% Mana, 40 yd range, 1.5 sec cast<br />
Smite an enemy for moderate Holy damage.<br />
<br />
<br />
Mind Blast<br />
<br />
3.0% Mana, 40 yd range, 1.5 sec cast<br />
Blast the target’s mind for strong Shadow damage.<br />
<br />
<br />
Penance<br />
<br />
2.5% Mana, 40 yd range, Channeled, 9 sec cooldown<br />
Launches a volley of holy light at the target, causing huge Holy damage over 2 sec.<br />
Channelable while moving.<br />
<br />
<br />
Revelation<br />
<br />
Passive<br />
Your Smite and Mind Blast casts have a 30% chance to reset the cooldown on Penance.<br />
<br />
<br />
Shadow Word: Pain<br />
<br />
2.0% Mana, 40 yd range, Instant<br />
A word of darkness that causes minor Shadow damage instantly, and an additional huge amount of Shadow damage over 18 sec.<br />
<br />
<br />
Additionally, to give you an idea of how some talents may build upon this, here’s an example of one of their Discipline-specific talents:<br />
<br />
Grace<br />
<br />
Passive<br />
Increases your non-Atonement healing and absorption by 30% on targets with Atonement.<br />
<br />

Loving the potential shadow changes, too; it had always felt a bit too much like the poor man's affliction warlock, but now it sounds like they're really pushing the whole &quot;You're too close to eldritch powers you barely understand&quot; ethos, and I think that's going to make for some interesting gameplay.</div></div><hr />

Just because they didn't mention COH, doesn't mean it is removed. They didn't mention fear ward, cascade, halo, divine star or like 15 other spells... don't assume things.</div></div><hr />

IF Disc priests are not haste build oriented this is going to suck a hole lot, since the global cooldown is 1.5 seconds to apply Atonement and before you started doing damage you're almost another 1.5 seconds cast away from healing. While EVERY other healers big heals are always 2.5 seconds casts, and if they are haste oriented the cast is even shorter. So before a Disc priest did ANY healing what so ever, which is half of a normal healer to begin with, i can not believe it will have much inpact.<br />
<br />
In my mind, not a guild by it's right mind is willing to go with half a dps or half a healer.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fullmetal89</div><div class="date">2015-11-09, 03:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah feels like they over designed Disc; that doesn't sound fun at all. More like tedious. Another spec I loved to play that is going to be benched.<br />
<br />
Shadow looks like the most fun out of the disc specs. Basically, they scrapped Demo locks and gave it to Shadow Priest. Oh well, never gone Shadow for a whole expansion before. This might be the first time.<br />
<br />
Holy seems to be the go to healer in Legion so far. New spells look pretty good, if I heal at all on my priest it will definitely be as holy. I hated the old chakra system so this is a welcomed change.</div></div><hr />

There's still PW:Shield, PW:Barrier whatever that is and Pain Suppression. <br />
You'll have Rupture for when you need to spam PW:Shield. And with shield's adding atonement, thing's look pretty legit to me.<br />
Shield's are still a big thing, more importantly, Shield's will be more or less exclusive to Disc Priests.</div></div><hr />

Given the talk before about a shadow priest redesign again to be more suited to them and making them different to warlocks... it still just reads the same old change from every expansion they just changed the resource mechanics *AGAIN*, but not changing any of the spells, except adding Shadowmend.<br />

Can we lose vampiric touch... or can it actually get a buff that makes it &quot;vampiric&quot;, it hasnt drained anything in like 3 expansions... its name has no meaning. <br />
Better yet, lose the vampiric touch and buff SWP and focus on one active dot.<br />

Actually Shadow looks like it has been...just rename orbs to insanity and you fill a bar instead of adding orbs. What I see there is just a darn recolor with all the old problems the Priest had(relying on a very slow build up while having to stay glued to a point to get the build up done. And when you are ready to burst then you should better not have to move either). Wether the insanity build up will be faster or slower than orbs, depends on the final numbers...and it seems that the priority list will not be less challenging than today(don't ask me why it has to be more challenging to play it at the top and then still have 10% less damage than other classes).<br />
<br />
The shadow already had like 5 makeovers or so....this one as presented here is likely the smallest of them and not going to change the situation of the shadow at all(while some before made the shadow from a pvp-monster into a PvE-only class, into a mana-generator, into an aoe class, into a support healer etc...).<br />

They may have been using it as an example for the talent choices. Maybe you can spec more bursty or DoT-y. This preview does make the Spriest look very similar to today's form, we shall see how the new talents mix things up.</div></div><hr />

How so? How is it different from today? That you get tendrils instead of black wings with a glyph?

Disc sounds a lot more bandag-y than big heals.<br />
I agree completely. However, when you look at WOD CMs (and MOP CMs), nearly all top times were made either with 1 tank and 4 DPS (with one of them providing off-heal) or the healer is a drood/shaman who can DPS and heal with the corresponding &quot;dps while heal&quot; talents.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, way to doom-say while just looking at &lt;10 abilities and 1 talent :P<br />
It's a problem of meta. If you have 1 healer providing way more DPS than the other, it's not going to end well in a 5-man setting.</div></div><hr />

IF Disc priests are not haste build oriented this is going to suck a hole lot, since the global cooldown is 1.5 seconds to apply Atonement and before you started doing damage you're almost another 1.5 seconds cast away from healing. While EVERY other healers big heals are always 2.5 seconds casts, and if they are haste oriented the cast is even shorter. So before a Disc priest did ANY healing what so ever, which is half of a normal healer to begin with, i can not believe it will have much inpact.<br />
<br />
In my mind, not a guild by it's right mind is willing to go with half a dps or half a healer.<br />

Maybe because if you wanna go full healer powerhouse, you should go with the full healing spec, the same way you would go full dps with shadow.<br />

Plenty of scenarios where you don't want a full healer, want more dps, but won't wanna go 0 heals. Maybe disc fills that.<br />

I fail to see the difference...<br />
<br />
- Bar energy is generated by mind blast and DoTs, baseline. Orbs are generated by only mind blast, baseline.<br />
<br />
- The purpose of insanity, is stay in it as long as possible to maximize the haste buff it looks like. The DP insanity buff nowadays is fixed, and uncontrolled.<br />
<br />
- This system provides bonus to all spells (void form), rather than singling out mind flay (DP's insanity buff).<br />
<br />
You also have to remember that there will be changes in regards to class that won't exactly be different in terms of general mechanics, but may change the name, description, animations to fit the fantasy of the class. And I believe this suits the idea of shadow rather well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't think so, one thing you are not accounting for is the scaling of a hybrid dps/healer. They talked about this ages ago and how they planned to do the redesign for Disc. I actually think that no one will want disc in 5 mans simply because they heal for less and won't be able to make up the damage of a true dps, the only time they will be viable is if an instance doesn't do as much damage (or the group can avoid damage) so their dps can be used while being a minor healer. Honestly a better description of them would be &quot;off&quot; healers and &quot;off&quot; dps, signifying that they just don't put out the numbers of other specs.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
My preference for a Shadow Priest artifact is a Wand, or a Halo, why have a knife when we dont stab things.<br />
<br />
Seriously, this is one of the complaints I have about the system.<br />
<br />
I like the new design because it feels like a progressive step towards something fun, what I don't like is the same thing I've disliked about this whole expansion and a slew of changes since wrath. It sounds like Sorbs are gone, which is great... but what about DP? You know... that 24 second vampiric dot we used to have that got mutated into the shitty combo point system as a finisher. It was my favorite ability back in wrath and with the advent of Sorbs they ruined it. We went from 3 dots to two, then more recently they removed snapshotting which greatly reduced the scaling of dot damge. This in conjunction with Mind Spike talent created dot weaving... in my opinion literally the worst thing that has ever happened to shadow in the history of the game. A class once about dots is now about spamming a short term cast while managing a badly implemented combo point system.<br />
<br />
So I'm happy we are moving to this void perspective, because it looks far less shitty. However it would seem we are going to lose my favorite ability, devouring plague. Additionally it doesn't sound like we will be about dots again... The void form refreshes both dots meaning it will be Blast, MF, MF, MF, MF, MF, Blast(depending on haste of course). I'm happy we are finally seeing a change that will get rid of dot weaving and Sorbs... I'm disappointed that it is still not taking the class to the glory it once knew.</div></div><hr />

Seems to me like Oblivion will be better used to keep you in insanity when you are about to run out due to the stacking haste buff. Waste of a CD to just go into insanity imo. I guess it depends on how fast the insanity usage ramps up vs the haste increase over time</div></div><hr />

I really don't like the idea of having an entire spec be this way. Having the possibility for fistweaver mechanics on monk and the talents that allow for moderate dps and moderate heals through changing gameplay were fine as the usage was entirely situational (CMs and the occasional progression attempt). They will probably be required for CMs but unplayable outside of CMs and maybe PvP.<br />

Thats a pretty poor assumption. Having 3-1/2 or 4-1/2 heals can be optimal edge for progressing dependng on where folks are at in their gearing. Every under-used resource matters in those situations.... Couldnt survive long enough because heals were a little soft; everybody survived just fine until beserk because ya had plenty of heals but not quite enough dps; etc.</div></div><hr />

A lot of hate on these forums for literally everything, and the obligatory &quot;clunky&quot; description for anything. What does that even mean anymore? <br />

Clunky, adjective, 1. A vague feeling of not liking something but lacking the vocabulary to express why.<br />

I was hoping for a shift finally from the age-old and mindlessly boring rotation of sw:p, mind blast, mind flay, mind flay, etc. until sw:d that it's seemingly been for a very long time. Channeled main spells just aren't real fun imo, and it turns into just constantly feeling like it's endlessly mind flaying. They don't hit hard and are just really dull to cast. So I was hoping the void shift would finally change that rotation but it looks like it's largely the same, just with short periods of insanity mixed in once in a while. Shadow priests have to be the only class with the same rotation essentially (just with cooldown changes here and there once in a while) for this long. <br />
<br />
The holy and disc changes are interesting though. Holy sounds much improved, and disc we'll have to see how it ends up. It's ok if it's complex, but if it's too complex to perform well consistently they'll be left behind. Also with disc, I worry since there's so much focus on recount/skada meters nowadays (even for healing when it often is a terrible metric for telling good healers from bad ones), that with them 50/50 of dps and healing they'll be so low on both dps and healing meters that they'll be left behind even though they overall are contributing a lot.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, beacuse Priests have two healing specs and from Legion onwards they sound like they will be differentiated to suit different mindsets/preferences. If you are a direct healing person (nothing wrong with that! - in privacy of own home...) then Holy sounds preferable for you.<br />
<br />
Personally I've always liked an aggressive, in-your-face style for disc, in PvP especially. Legion Disc looks beautiful, I just hope theres another living soul on my server in 12 months time...</div></div><hr />

And it's nice how Disc is kind of a balance between holy and shadow, DPS and heal. It's how I used to imagine it before it became the &quot;shield spec&quot;.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
- The purpose of insanity, is stay in it as long as possible to maximize the haste buff it looks like. The DP insanity buff nowadays is fixed, and uncontrolled.<br />
<br />
- This system provides bonus to all spells (void form), rather than singling out mind flay (DP's insanity buff).<br />
<br />
You also have to remember that there will be changes in regards to class that won't exactly be different in terms of general mechanics, but may change the name, description, animations to fit the fantasy of the class. And I believe this suits the idea of shadow rather well.<br />
<br />
<br />
Not true. Orbs are currently mainly generated by shadows that are a result of SW:P. Essentially it stays the same tho: Cast the same spells and end up with 5 orbs or the new insanity. You tried to stay in the old insanity as long as possible as well. So no change there. You stay in the new insanity to maximize haste to maximize damage...old one is just to maximize damage. It may feel a bit more bursty with haste(depening on what caps they will introduce)...but you will be penalized even more for having to move then.<br />
<br />
You will anyway just cast the spell that does the most damage during insanity. Currently it ain't all mind flay either cause you still have to throw in Sw:P, Mind blast and devouring plague to keep orbs and insanity up. Not sure if the new system will add something there...but on the other hand I do NOT see why the shadow needs to get even more challenging...it's already one of the most difficult trees anyway.</div></div><hr />

I have played priest for so long, I really hope they don't make so many changes that it hurts the class. While I do see the point of too many absorbs prventing other healers from doing their thing, this MIGHT be too big a step in the other direction. disc is going to lose their niche I am afraid.</div></div><hr />

Holy seems like it will be a force to be reckoned with considering its many potent 1 min CD uber heals! this is a very interesting and unique direction and i feel that its fitting!<br />
Discipline is EXACTLY what i wanted it to be! Using a full offensive rotation and a fusion of shadow and light magic, this embodies discipline better than any other iteration, im loving it!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TenYearsOfDisc</div><div class="date">2015-11-09, 08:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">For those not in the priest forums, my thoughts on the new disc:<br />
<br />
I agree with those saying this is a bad idea, and echo the sentiments that it sounds clunky and will not be effective. People then say, well play HOLY, well, I don't want to. Here are my main concerns.<br />
<br />
1) What would possess these people to remove penance as a heal? That is absurd, other than shielding it is the quintessential aspect of a disc priest, talk about the soul of a class and spec, and frankly it fits perfect with the &quot;damage and healing&quot; hybrid thing they have going on. It also presents a choice.<br />
<br />
2) Why do we have smite and mind blast, both with a 1.5 sec cast and no cool down? This is stupid. We shouldn't have a little of this a little of that, why don't we have our own unique spells that can either be used as damage or healing (as we did with penance).<br />
<br />
3) We will never be as effective as another healer, even if we have the same output in the end, the setup time will be too little too late, and it sounds more like a clusterfck of annoyance to keep up the buff on people while targeting around to do damage as well.<br />
<br />
It comes down to this, most of these designers don't even play the game, let alone the classes or specs they are working with. It may sound fun on paper to people who don't play disc now, but it's going to be a mess, forcing disc to go holy and basically killing the spec for anything other than a gimmick.<br />
<br />
PW: Shield shouldn't have a cooldown, it should be something we can place on people to put the buff on, and then damage through holy fire and smite, using penance on cooldown. If you want the neuter the power of the shield, that's fine, but this spec needs to be simplified. There is going to be no way to keep track of all of this while worrying about damage, and healing, it's convoluted and frankly, &quot;just go holy&quot; won't be an answer I'm happy with after loving disc and all of the various changes throughout my ten years of play.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tomana</div><div class="date">2015-11-09, 08:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I actually think that no one will want disc in 5 mans simply because they heal for less and won't be able to make up the damage of a true dps, the only time they will be viable is if an instance doesn't do as much damage (or the group can avoid damage) so their dps can be used while being a minor healer. Honestly a better description of them would be &quot;off&quot; healers and &quot;off&quot; dps, signifying that they just don't put out the numbers of other specs.<br />
<br />
Given the fact CMs are already run with 3.5 DPSers (or even 4), I'd say disc will be spot on for that.</div></div><hr />

I laughed so hard at this people were concerned about me.<br />

Yea so 7 years of being THE healing class, better than any other healer, and forcing every Priest to be Disc, you're depressed that after 5 expansion of being MANDATORY to raiding content, you have to change specs.<br />
<br />
The whine is palpable (Also Ion Hozzikostas mains a disc priest, you can blame him for the crazy dominance, and probably 1 patch of Disc weakness in Legion before it's buffed back to being the #1 defacto healer again).</div></div><hr />

Loving the potential shadow changes, too; it had always felt a bit too much like the poor man's affliction warlock, but now it sounds like they're really pushing the whole &quot;You're too close to eldritch powers you barely understand&quot; ethos, and I think that's going to make for some interesting gameplay.<br />

It triggers the most precisely when one is losing anyway, when it is most needed, not really overpowered when it tends to help the underdog. Hopefully one of the Legions glyphs or something will permit the like.<br />

Playing up the style of specs is nice up to a point, but, for the heart of gameplay (fun), one of the advantages of some healers in WoW over, say, Aion's version, has been more utility.

<br />
I agree, in terms of hardcore raiding, having a TRUE (Finally! It wasn't exactly a &quot;real&quot; thing until this) DPS/Healing hybrid is huge.<br />
<br />
When it comes to healing, you only need a finite amount to &quot;get by&quot;. In general, once you're at that point where you can comfortably have your raid stay alive, you don't take any more healers. When things are on farm or even a little before that, raids start dropping a healer or 2 for DPS.<br />
<br />
Discipline will allow raids to transition to that point sooner or even just start at that point by having real hybrids in the raid. Any fight that is not a &quot;OMFG-everyone-drops-down-to-5%-health-every-20-seconds-healing-check&quot; should have a Discipline Priest, I see absolutely no reason not to (and high end guilds/great raids could use them even then).<br />
<br />
This new Discipline pretty much reads to me as, &quot;if 5 Disc Priests can keep your raid alive then there's no reason to bring any other healing spec!&quot; It seems to me that there will be much balancing needed to get this right since the very concept of DPS/healing hybrids is very powerful. They would be replacing 1 issue with another (absorbs making other healers feel inadequate or unnecessary traded for healers being sat for Disc Priests!!!). So it needs to be done very carefully.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Fair enough. But if you've been healing with a Priest since Wrath, you should know that Disc has been the intended &quot;hybrid&quot; since what, Cata? Just because it was a fail hybrid most of the time, and perhaps you've grown accustom to the style of healing(absorbing) that's grown out of that failure, acting as if Disc priests aren't SUPPOSED to be hybrids is a bit ... weird.<br />
<br />
And also ...<br />
<br />
<br />
Neither a good healer or damage dealer? As if finding a place in a decent raiding guild as a Discipline Priest wasn't hard enough already, imagine what it will be like in Legion... Going from &quot;can only have 1 disc&quot; to &quot;well, disc sucks, go holy&quot;<br />
<br />
I don't think you've put enough thought into what they've revealed thus far, and your assumption of &quot;neither a good healer or damage dealer&quot; is immensely flawed. Now if you don't want to deal with a more complex play style and higher skill cap, that's understandable (no backhanded insult there, I promise). But suggesting Disc shouldn't be a hybrid when Blizz has been trying, but failing, to make that work for years now, and then assuming it's going to be shite on top of that, is not entirely sensible. <br />
<br />
In fact, moving Disc away from the mostly bubble-spam spec it's been in WoD to less absorbs overall with more legit healing (partially through damage dealing) will improve the likelihood of a raid being able to have more than one Disc (unless it's tuned to shit numbers), not decrease it. The whole reason it's been &quot;one Disc only pls&quot; is because two mass-bubbling/absorb healers doesn't work.</div></div><hr />

What are you talking about, Disc was OP for several years now (it may have something to do with Ion maining a Disc Priest :rolleyes:).<br />
Don't worry, whatever their play style may be, Disc priests will still be OP as ****.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bloodmoth13</div><div class="date">2015-11-15, 11:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I can not believe that Disc is going to be a useful healer when i read the preview. So it's going to be roughtly 50/50 damage/healing.<br />
IF Disc priests are not haste build oriented this is going to suck a hole lot, since the global cooldown is 1.5 seconds to apply Atonement and before you started doing damage you're almost another 1.5 seconds cast away from healing. While EVERY other healers big heals are always 2.5 seconds casts, and if they are haste oriented the cast is even shorter. So before a Disc priest did ANY healing what so ever, which is half of a normal healer to begin with, i can not believe it will have much inpact.<br />
<br />
In my mind, not a guild by it's right mind is willing to go with half a dps or half a healer.<br />
<br />
did you read the description?<br />
Discs big heal (shadow mend) heals TWICE as much as flash heal! this is the ability they use to mark for attonement!<br />
use this, if they take damage before you can mind blast, GREAT! the bonus heal decays if they dont take damage! if you cast mind blast, you get off another big heal.<br />
<br />
the method of setting up attonement is healing and alot of it is preemptive, and frontloaded allowing the priest to then build up steady attonement healing with SW:P, MB, smites and pennance.<br />
<br />
Personally i think this is perfect! this is exactly what i wanted in this spec and i couldnt be happier<br />

So while you hurt things, you become more insane, until you completely lose control and go on a killing spree... <br />
... with the same void power that some of the badest enemies have wielded (Old Gods, Twilights, Undead, Nerubian)<br />
and the Priest Order is perfectly fine with that and have at least 66% of their members happily to go Insane in the middle of a fight.<br />
If church wasnt creepy before the alter to the Old Gods in the basement might be a bit messed up.<br />
<br />
Given the talk before about a shadow priest redesign again to be more suited to them and making them different to warlocks... it still just reads the same old change from every expansion they just changed the resource mechanics *AGAIN*, but not changing any of the spells, except adding Shadowmend.<br />
<br />
Can we lose vampiric touch... or can it actually get a buff that makes it &quot;vampiric&quot;, it hasnt drained anything in like 3 expansions... its name has no meaning. <br />
Better yet, lose the vampiric touch and buff SWP and focus on one active dot.<br />
<br />
My preference for a Shadow Priest artifact is a Wand, or a Halo, why have a knife when we dont stab things.<br />
<br />
does anyone even read the descriptions? VT drains HP now<br />

So I guess it's official. Not extending my sub, nor buying Legion.<br />
<br />
I've been Disc main since WotLK, and never before has the &quot;gameplay&quot; put me off so much as what Legion has planned.<br />
I chose to be a healer many years ago, not a damage dealer. I have alts for those few times that I do want to deal damage. I don't want to spend time focusing on how many adds there are, or if my DoT's are about to fall off or whatever.. I want to heal, and prevent my allies from taking damage, simple as that. This is the sole reason all my main alts atm are healers..<br />
On top of that, performing as an hybrid? Neither a good healer or damage dealer? As if finding a place in a decent raiding guild as a Discipline Priest wasn't hard enough already, imagine what it will be like in Legion... Going from &quot;can only have 1 disc&quot; to &quot;well, disc sucks, go holy&quot;<br />
<br />
Reroll has never been an option, and never will, so I guess it's goodbye WoW. It's been a fun 9 years!<br />
<br />
Play holy if you dont like it, and disc is supposed to be a full healer that also damages, if you wanna be a holy priest with holy spells go holy!<br />
<br />
But seriously, if innovation makes you cry, then you wont be missed<br />
<br />

<br />
The way i see healers performing now is this:<br />
<br />
All healers will deal decent damage now, the better they heal the more time they can spend doing dps (if you are really good, you can do 50% healing 50% dps)<br />
Discipline priests embace this baseline and to 90% healing through doing dps<br />
<br />
Over the course of a fight, other healers will catch up to disc damage<br />
<br />
Just a thought, but they stated they want healers to be able to do pve content solo and for players to be able to level as a healer</div></div><hr />
