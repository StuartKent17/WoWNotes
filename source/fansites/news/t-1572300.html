Slow Flight Paths<br />
So, first thing I should mention is that, while we're still adjusting and tweaking the flow of each zone, it doesn't make much sense for us to spend a bunch of time optimizing flight paths. Any manner of changes could happen to a given location or quest hub that would require us to redo all that work -- even something as simple as moving the flightmaster to the other side of a camp, or raising the terrain a bit to make it look more interesting.<br />
<br />
We've done a little bit of optimizing here and there where we've felt confident that such changes won't happen, but we're getting to the point that we can start collecting a broader range of feedback on flight paths for future adjustments. To help with that, I've just posted a stickied thread in which we'd love for you to share your feedback on flight paths that could use some attention.<br />
<br />
We're still very much committed to making sure that getting around Draenor doesn't feel like a chore, so any such feedback is extremely valuable to us. Thanks! (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/331824-flight-paths-take-too-long/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/13778247913?page=2#33))<br />
<br />
Targeted Feedback Request: Flight Paths<br />
As we start to wrap up major changes to quest flow and zone layouts, we're ready to start taking a harder look at flight paths and work on cleaning them up. To that end, we're putting this thread together to serve as a centralized location to point out flight paths in need of improvement.<br />
<br />
Examples of the sort of feedback we're looking for include:<br />
<br />
Flights that seem to move slowly Flights that make unnecessarily meandering loops or turns Flights that could make more efficient connections Any other weird glitches, stops, etc. that occur while on a flight<br />
<br />
Thanks! (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/332064-targeted-feedback-request-flight-paths/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/13816271516?page=1#1))<br />

Classes<br />
So your version of equality is take away utility from low dps classes and give it to high dps?<br />
No, it's to reduce the utility of high utility classes and increase that of low utility classes, then equalize DPS. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/496098816022806528))<br />

Why is DeathKnight the only class with 2 roles that doesn't have Talents change based on spec when pure DPS classes like mage do<br />
Because none of the talents need it. DKs overlap a lot between tank and DPS. Same resource system, for example. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/496335845322784769))<br />
Many counterexamples. NPlague WAY mandatory for Unholy DPS w/+60% disease dmg, and covers-up Blood's huge wait time.<br />
Those aren't counterexamples. Those are tuning problems. Or do you just mean that they need different tuning by spec? (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/496411818378543105))<br />

dream of cenarius has always interacted with healing touch, why was the decision made to make it a passive heal for balance?<br />
It's really tough to make a talent that's supposed to be DPS neutral for a Moonkin, yet add Healing Touches. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/496201588147372032))<br />
So, the new version still gives you Healing Touches, they just auto-pick their target for you. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/496201738680926208))<br />

by engine i mean the synergy between master marksman and steady focus etc marksman now looks kindaempty<br />
Yeah, totally understandable. We removed MMarksman because it became a lot less interesting with... (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/496179859459043328))<br />
...the switch to making Aimed their main focus dump. Goal is to allow talent choices to add... (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/496180101013196800))<br />
...rotational depth and complication, but I think many of their talent choices boil down to 'Use on CD' (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/496180225881808898))<br />
I'd say that Focusing Shot does a good job of that, but it's not a style that everyone will like. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/496180410498310144))<br />

Well my feedback is change Arcane Orb is not useful in boss fights and Overpowered is just crappy like Flameglow.<br />
Why do you not find Arcane Orb useful in boss fights? Which boss fights? What makes Overpowered feel crappy to you? (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/496175525803479040))<br />
And Flameglow is much less crappy now; we upped its numbers considerably. Have you tried it with that change? (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/496175719735492608))<br />
Overpowered is based in proc from AM and even saving those procs you may only prolong AP a few more seconds<br />
You should always be able to prolong it by at least 6sec, more like 12 on avg. That 'fighting against time' style... (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/496177844527984640))<br />
...can be a lot of fun. Definitely possible that its effects are heavily RNG; data/analysis on that is welcome. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/496178129270882304))<br />
ok ill give you Overpowered what abiut Arcane Orb is to low damage compared to PC or even Overpowered.<br />
&quot;Low Damage&quot; = Tuning problem. We'll get that fixed. I've heard that the gameplay is a ton of fun. Agree/disagree? (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/496182662327836673))<br />
<br />
Arcane Orb interacting with the spec is cool. Any thoughts on having Meteor interact more?<br />
I believe we made it cause Ignite, and the delay lets you stack it on top of Pyros, for Combustion (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/496186244062138370))<br />
That's awesome! Thanks. Anything to be done with Comet Storm?<br />
Tough one. Not sure that Frost needs more of any procs. Suggestions welcome. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/496187657035071488))<br />

are you worried that arms might stance dance to fill in gcds if def stance gets devaste and revenge?<br />
Yes, absolutely a concern that we'll make sure doesn't happen with whatever design we settle on. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/496201119148683264))<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
There any talk of doing a legendary pvp item done like the cloak?<br />
I don't think so. Rarity and extreme power are inherent to Legendaries and that doesn't seem like the best fit for PvP gear. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/496191217537785857))<br />

What you're telling us right now is that it apparently takes longer that 10 months to make two capitals w/o copy/pasting.<br />
In terms of man-months, it's actually longer, if you can believe it. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/496079507573321728))<br />
How do you not have infinite time.... Blizzard has always stood for releasing quality products with no release dates at all.<br />
Always has to be weighed against the community not getting content for another X months. It's a tough call. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/496120263537623040))<br />
<br />
well we could also make Gilneas our home city if we felt like it, but why would we do that? zero hub utility = no visits<br />
You could argue that Silvermoon has full functionality and isn't visited, but is very pretty. Why aren't people there? (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/496120620196036608))<br />
At the risk of opening a can of worms: Silvermoon also has no flying and so is esp. awkward to get to compared to the likes of Org<br />
All of Draenor has no flying too (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/496128707011309568))<br />

Free Character Migrations Available<br />
If you're on one of the source realms listed below, you can move your characters to one of the designated destination realms and avoid the queues—for free!<br />
<br />
By initiating one of these transfers, you will be moving your character to a new realm and home. This is a one-time, one-way move. If you wish to move your character elsewhere, you will need to use the paid transfer service (https://eu.battle.net/account/management/wow/services/pct-select.html?).<br />
<br />
Outland -&gt; Grim Batol, Karazhan<br />
<br />
Please be aware that, due to the unpredictable nature of free transfers, we may close down any Free Character Migrations at any time and without warning if the target realm becomes full. If you plan to move with friends or your guild, we suggest that you coordinate the effort to reduce the chance of any stragglers being left behind.<br />
<br />
Early closures aside, this set of Free Character Migrations will end on Tuesday, August 19.<br />
<br />
Begin a Free Character Migration now (https://eu.battle.net/account/management/wow/fcm/character-list.html?r=EU&amp;l=WoW1)! We recommend reviewing the FAQ (https://eu.battle.net/support/en/article/free-character-migration), as it details what is or isn't allowed for transferred characters. <br />

It just ain't giving the feeling &quot;there we are, now WE got to do something&quot;....it's more like &quot;sit back and watch the show unfolding&quot;.</div></div><hr />
