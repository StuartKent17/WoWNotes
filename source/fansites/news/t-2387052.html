Personally I'm hoping there's a filter or direct link to wow posts or something so I don't have to scroll thru big long posts like the OW one I just saw (right now its on mmoc/content so I guess its fine, but maybe it can be /wow or something if needed, cant see myself bothering to scroll thru long OW posts like that one)<br />

The front page of the site will continue to operate as it always had. You will need to visit the Heroes or Overwatch sections to see those news posts.</div></div><hr />

cool, that is ideal. in the event it does get forced at some point, a direct link or something would work but the casually visiting audience might never be able to figure that out<br />
<br />
with heroes back on the come up since the 2.0 update, i figured curse had to bring this back at some point after the initial site shutter. game seems like itll remain relevant for the long haul.</div></div><hr />

How's that?<br />
<br />
Overwatch is the FPS you play if you suck at every actual FPS games<br />

Hots is what you play if you suck at everything else<br />

<br />
So they pull in HOTS and Overwatch which is where all the kids are. Soon enough they'll also re-vamp the forums and lift those buried Overwatch and HOTS forums higher up.<br />
And then the site will be re-branded to &quot;blizzard champions&quot; - just like so many other WoW community sites and podcasts in recent years.<br />

Yes, they are multiplayer games and they are online. But 6vs6 is far from massive. The other M in mmoYeah no. I see your point by the smallest fracture if I was as narrow-minded as yourself but Overwatch has a massive playing base, Heroes not as much but it's still played by a decent sized community. And yeah, not only 10 or 12 dudes are playing at that one time across the globe. <br />
Multiple that group of 12 by hundreds for several different groups playing a match, all at once. That's where MMO comes into play but it's omitted because people like yourself will try to state the obvious. But it isn't actually wrong when that &quot;massive&quot; definition comes from outside the small window you see of like the 11 others you're with but rather the multiple groups playing simultaneously, a bit like PvP in Warcraft for you to better handle the understanding. There is still a cap to how many, but they have several of said groups playing... Yay Battlegroups.<br />
<br />
You have a clear chip on your shoulder about actual a set of current, multiplayer, online games that have an actual massive audience and confirmed constantly by the MAU and profit margins openly displayed in quarterly calls (to which only shows people who actually DO buy with money because not everyone DOES) here but you're not complaining about DOTA forums for example that's already part of the MMO-Champion forum. *scratches head*. As DOTA is already here, I can't see why another is a problem. They're both MOBA.</div></div><hr />

You realize-- it's already filtered right? See those little buttons on the top of the website? Don't want HotS or OW news, don't click on those buttons. Or did you forget that they've been having HotS/OW news for like a year now mixed with the WoW news? This way you actually DON'T see OW/HotS news unless you want them.<br />

Except those other mmo's are vastly underplayed, allready have their own fan sites, and dont update nearly as much as hots and overwatch have.<br />
<br />
also fans of wow are much more likely to be fans of hots ands overwatch then also being fans of ff14 and gw2...<br />
So no, put blizzard fans together instead of a bunch of people who all hate eachothers games.<br />

Uhh what? They are literrally filtering it now more then before... Before the hots and overwatch stuff would go on the front page with the wow stuff, now they have their own versions of the website.<br />
seriously you spent all of half a second thinking about this, you have LESS to filter through, now that they have 3 seperate versions of the website for each game.<br />

Does bringing SJW Overwatch on the site mean the political offtopic forums will be closed? You don't want those pure souls corrupted.<br />
<br />
overwatch has allways been on here, as has hots, they are just making a custom website for each to put the news for those instead of putting them on the front page with the wow stuff.<br />

<br />
I suppose this was what the opening for frontpage news was for, grats to whoever got the gig<br />
<br />
Personally I'm hoping there's a filter or direct link to wow posts or something so I don't have to scroll thru big long posts like the OW one I just saw (right now its on mmoc/content so I guess its fine, but maybe it can be /wow or something if needed, cant see myself bothering to scroll thru long OW posts like that one)<br />
<br />
Wowhead has been posting so much extraneous/fluff stuff that they had to handle it with auto collapsed news posts<br />

It's not really 'MMO' champion then, is it?<br />
<br />
People who play wow and go to a wow based website are more likely to then also go and play hots and overwatch then final fantasy or gw2<br />
so yeah no, and putting the two on the same place on mass would just inspire a million threads aday about &quot;our game is better yours sucks&quot; <br />
<br />
So still it is MMOchamp, focusing on wow mostly, with other mmo's mentioned when big patches come out, but now it has a section for hots and overwatch.</div></div><hr />

<br />
would not go well, players usually play only 1 mmo, it is a game type that requires alot of dedication, and that can breed &quot;Our game is better then yours&quot;<br />
Putting all the fans of all the MMO's on this website would inspire even more trolling and even more &quot;wow is dead, our game is better&quot; then there allready is, you think there is &quot;I quit this is why im better then blizzard&quot; threads now? Think of if you put the final fantasy players, gw2 players, wildstar players, wildstar, rift, etc, it would be a MESS<br />
<br />
Those who play wow are much more likely to play hots, overwatch, etc... Then to play other mmo's<br />

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ read above, also why change their name? Changing their name to blizzard champion could get them in alot of trouble, and also then they would need to focus on all blizzard games.

<br />
who are these 'many others'? Okay, purple's a bit too distracting, could be more subdued, but if it's 'killing' your eyes, you should probably see an optician. But yeah, soft blue would look way, way better.</div></div><hr />

By what metric?<br />
<br />
dont update nearly as much as hots and overwatch have.<br />
I hope you are kidding. GW2 and FFXIV have more updates than WoW, not even mentioning mighty &quot;3 heroes per year&quot; in HotS.<br />
<br />
<br />
also fans of wow are much more likely to be fans of hots ands overwatch then also being fans of ff14 and gw2...<br />
<br />
Fans of WoW are unlikely to play anything but WoW at all, considering Legion gri- I mean 'content'. Former fans of WoW are more likely to look for another MMO instead of playing shitty MOBA and yet another FPS.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">glowpipe</div><div class="date">2018-03-30, 06:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah no. I see your point by the smallest fracture if I was as narrow-minded as yourself but Overwatch has a massive playing base, Heroes not as much but it's still played by a decent sized community. And yeah, not only 10 or 12 dudes are playing at that one time across the globe. <br />
Multiple that group of 12 by hundreds for several different groups playing a match, all at once. That's where MMO comes into play but it's omitted because people like yourself will try to state the obvious. But it isn't actually wrong when that &quot;massive&quot; definition comes from outside the small window you see of like the 11 others you're with but rather the multiple groups playing simultaneously, a bit like PvP in Warcraft for you to better handle the understanding. There is still a cap to how many, but they have several of said groups playing... Yay Battlegroups.<br />
<br />
You have a clear chip on your shoulder about actual a set of current, multiplayer, online games that have an actual massive audience and confirmed constantly by the MAU and profit margins openly displayed in quarterly calls (to which only shows people who actually DO buy with money because not everyone DOES) here but you're not complaining about DOTA forums for example that's already part of the MMO-Champion forum. *scratches head*. As DOTA is already here, I can't see why another is a problem. They're both MOBA.<br />
<br />
So with your logic, every singleplayer only game out there with shitton of players are also mmo games.<br />
<br />
I know that there are a lot of players in overwatch. Im not stupid, well, a bit, but not in this case. But you only play with 5 others against 6 others, at a given time. A mmo is a game where there are several thousand online at the same time on the same server. Battlefield got 64vs64 and multiplied by all the servers. Still not a mmo.<br />
<br />
the core definition of mmo: A massively multiplayer online game (MMOG, or more commonly, MMO) is an online game with large numbers of players, typically from hundreds to thousands, on the same server<br />
<br />
overwatch never have more than 12 on any given server. <br />
With your logic, Far cry 5 is a mmo. Which its not. Not even remotely close</div></div><hr />

Lol three a year? Nice joke. Since the start of 2017 they have brought out 18 heros. So nice try buddy.<br />
No that is not how it works. And why the fuck would we want people who don't play wow on a wow website?<br />
Again this website has always and always will be a wow focused website. I don't see you have any argument here other then childish nonsense. Specially since a simple 3 second google search would have proven your 3 a year wrong by an account of 3-18</div></div><hr />

<br />
And look at what info is posted. How often is it information from the various developers regarding WoW's direction or possible changes? And they specifically made WarcraftDevs so they could post from one account only, yet the amount of posting dropped significantly. There was a huge thread on this on the WoW subreddit a year ago. You act as if Blizzard didn't manage to both do their job AND talk with us for years. As if they were simply just slacking off the whole time they talked to the playerbase and nothing was done. Contrary to what you might think, Blizzard CAN walk and chew gum at the same time. <br />
<br />
But yeah I do miss those days. I had great informative discussions with Ghostcrawler, WatcherDev, and others about the game. They also explained in detail their various ideas and changes so the playerbase got an understanding. It was quite nice. Those tweets and other blue posts were often which led to MMO-C having loads to post on the front page daily.</div></div><hr />

this post is that hots and overwatch will be getting their own versions of the website, meaning the news feed for world of warcraft will no longer be flooded with hots and overwatch news. again how the fuck does this have anything to do with warcraft devs, that mmochamp will not only be making 1+ posts on the wow news? why i asked if you read the post, cause you dont seem to have.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">FelPlague</div><div class="date">2018-03-31, 07:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, but you agree that neither Overwatch nor Heroes of the Storm are MMOs, aren't you?<br />
<br />
correct, why they are on their own versions of the website.<br />
MMO's are a game gewnre that requires alot of time and dedication, so it is most common for people to only play one at a time, meaning a few things.<br />
<br />
1. the other mmo's allready have their own websites so why would mmochamp try to compete when its known for being wow focused<br />
2. the name does not need to match... ffs &quot;Apple&quot; does not sell fruit &quot;Microsoft&quot; does not sell micro sponges or blankets &quot;Boring company&quot; SELLS FUCKING HANDHELDED FLAMETHROWERS!!! the name really has nothing to do with what they sell, what does any fast food joint other then taco bell, burger king, pizza hut/nova/pizza have to do with the food they sell? Mcdonalds, what is that a farm? <br />
3. people who play wow are much more likey to play overwatch and hots then other mmo's<br />
4. people who play mmo's are very dedicated and unwillingy to try others because of the time required to play them<br />
5. they also like to prove themselves, so trying to compile all the mmo communities onto one website would make sure the forums are nothing but<br />
&quot;OUR MMO IS BETTER THEN YOUR SHITTY MMO&quot; and &quot;THIS IS WHY OUR GAME IS BETTER!&quot; or &quot;THIS GAME IS DEAD, IM GOING TO PLAY OTHER GAME&quot;<br />
a million times a day, even without those other communities here on mass we still get way too many of these threads.<br />

yes, and apple should change their name to computers, phones, and watches. tm<br />
Cause i mean since when have they had anything to do with fruit?<br />
And uhh boring company should change their name to &quot;Totally not selling a flamethrower&quot; and uhh<br />
Valve should change their name to &quot;2&quot; because they cant count to 3 and they havent made a single game about valves!<br />
oh oh, and uhh one punch man should be called &quot;Sometimes punching once dude&quot; because i mean there is alot of times where he has to use multiple punches so wtf is that sort of fake advertisement.<br />
<br />
i hate to have to keep saying this, but people who play wow are much more likely to play hots and overwatch then another MMO since MMO's are a &quot;i only play 1 or 2 max&quot; and if they tried to bring all the players to mmochamp on mass from all the mmo's the threads would be nothing but &quot;this game sucks, this game is trash, our game is better, your game is dead, this is why you should play our game&quot; and even then we allready have those, imagine if all the fans were here.<br />

Didn't bother reading the rest because that is the dumbest analogy on the planet. &quot;Apple&quot; is just the name of the company, it doesn't imply that they sell Apples any more than Samsung implies they sell the biblical character.<br />
<br />
MMO stands for a specific game genre. Unless we were fooled this entire time and it's the initials of the creator, it was a site specifically created for the MMO genre.<br />
<br />
I have absolutely not qualms if it wants to delve into other genres, just saying the name no longer suits the site. They should broaden it.</div></div><hr />

Judging by your post count, we'll be arguing this over the course of a decade unless I snip this in the bud right now. So you do you boo. Think whatever you want. <br />
<br />
Until then, MMO-Champ should rebrand to Blizz-Champ or Game-Champ and expand their services while appealing to a broader base.<br />
<br />
<br />
Don't @ me.</div></div><hr />

And you should get back to watching the new anime &quot;sometimes single hit boy&quot;. im sure that re-branding would be so easily done.</div></div><hr />

WHY is this not optional? Now whenever I go to the HotS subsection it overrides my forum theme setting and makes everything an eye burning shade of purple instead of the easy on the eye green. Discussion forums and websites requiring reading have historically used neutral easy to read colour schemes for a damn reason.<br />
<br />
These new themes should only have ever been optional NOT MANDATORY!</div></div><hr />
