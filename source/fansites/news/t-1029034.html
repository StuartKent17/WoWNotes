<br />
Dev Watercooler - Faction Favoritism<br />
One of our earliest design goals with World of Warcraft was to ensure a healthy rivalry between the Alliance and the Horde. Cross-faction communication was banned outright, even where it made little or no sense in the lore. Entire realms are dedicated to PvP. Battlegrounds and quest hubs feature prominent Alliance and Horde iconography. We want to foster a sense of factional pride, a real identity with your brothers and sisters in arms.<br />
<br />
We want players to be proud of their faction, even at the expense of personal dignity. One time I was driving my wife home from dinner. She leaned out of the car window, threw the horns, and screamed “FOR THE HORDE!” at some dude who was standing outside the restaurant in his Horde hockey jersey. Poor guy probably forgot he was wearing it. We peeled off in a thick cloud of blue tire smoke, and I think we made him pee.<br />
<br />
That’s what I’m talking about.<br />
<br />
So when it comes to the game’s ongoing story developments, it’s no surprise that Alliance and Horde fans are “keeping score.” Maps and charts of territory gained and lost started showing up around the time the Cataclysm shook the world to its foundations. Southshore plagued? Taurajo burned? Oh no they didn’t!<br />
<br />
Implicit amidst most of the grumbling from either side is the assumption that Blizzard should be fairly treating both factions. Then there’s the more explicit assumption: if one faction is losing ground, then Blizzard must be biased.<br />
<br />
Are we?<br />
<br />
It’s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World. Of Warcraft.<br />
<br />
Maybe we are. A quick survey of Azeroth’s history reveals that we’ve been punishing the Alliance for generations. Stormwind was razed by orcs back in Warcraft I. Then Lordaeron fell to the plague in Warcraft III, its inhabitants turned into a mindless mob of undead. High-elven allies were besieged by the scourge and had their city sacked and their source of power corrupted. (The survivors of both these atrocities found solace in the Horde.) The gnomish capital was irradiated. The dwarven kingdoms were shattered by a terrible civil war. I’m surprised there’s an Alliance left at all.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, those humans got off easy -- at least they still have a planet. The orc homeworld was overrun with demons and obliterated. Almost the entire race was poisoned by demonic blood. By the end of Warcraft II, what little remained of the orc race was stranded on an alien world, defeated, sullen, weak, and locked away in human-controlled internment camps.<br />
<br />
I’m sure glad we didn’t have orc forums back then! Imagine the outrage.<br />
<br />
In truth, a historical account of the Warcraft universe reads like a war crimes trial. Empires topple, leaders are corrupted, populations are massacred, entire civilizations fall to ruin (often at their peak of power)… Warcraft is a dark place. Just ask the Draenei: We trashed their homeworld and tortured its last uncorrupted children for tens of thousands of years. We’re downright cruel. I’ve never met a more sadistic team of story folk.<br />
<br />
Suffering is the gasoline that drives our story engine. Why is that?<br />
<br />
The Hero Factory<br />
<br />
Here at Blizzard, we often talk about what we’re trying to build with the fiction of the Warcraft universe. The phrase “Hero Factory” frequently comes up across all of our franchises. We want the players to feel like heroes.<br />
<br />
The primordial soup that creates heroes never tastes of rainbows -- it’s a lumpy gumbo of suffering and evil. Heroes are born from darkness, because we desperately need someone to light the way.<br />
<br />
It’s an unfair world that cries out for heroes. To bring order out of chaos and justice to the downtrodden is the hero’s call. Is it any wonder that Azeroth is an unfair place? It’s monstrously unfair. And it’s going to stay that way.<br />
<br />
Of Story Arcs and Storied Orcs<br />
<br />
We can guarantee an unfair and inequitable treatment of both factions for now and in the foreseeable future. This allows us to have richer long-term story arcs, another idea that we’ve been experimenting with since the build-up to Cataclysm. To see the factions ebb and flow as their leaders get embroiled in all manner of heroism or skullduggery is like a reward for long-time players.<br />
<br />
Speaking of faction leaders, that’s one area where I think we can do better: Giving everyone a chance to interact with their heroes throughout the story. In creating this universe, I’ll admit that we at Blizzard often fall into a trap of thinking of our main characters as “world” characters and not individual faction characters.<br />
<br />
For example, the events of the cataclysm put in motion some major story developments for Thrall, who’d been sitting relatively idle in Orgrimmar since the events of Warcraft III. He was forced to choose between his role as warchief and as a shaman who could potentially save the world. He set aside the warchief’s mantle and, with your help, he’ll play an instrumental role in bringing an end to Deathwing.<br />
<br />
But there’s a price to pay. Thrall sacrificed something.<br />
<br />
The Horde has gone through a story arc of its own, since the days when the ragged refugee orcs first stumbled onto the beaches of Kalimdor and decided to found a new capital. The Horde races have united and consolidated. The Forsaken, no longer tormented by the Lich King, have secured their borders. The tauren have settled a homeland. The Darkspear trolls, once on the brink of extinction thanks to murlocs (murlocs!), have rallied together and founded a capital. The blood elves have survived the destruction of their home, moved beyond the defection of their leader, and reclaimed the Sunwell. The Horde is absolutely ascendant.<br />
<br />
And in this moment, as one of the most powerful groups of mortals on Azeroth seeks to define itself, Thrall is out of the picture. The Horde’s mission is being defined by Garrosh Hellscream. Thrall’s decision to leave him in charge is coming back to haunt him.<br />
<br />
If you’re a die-hard Alliance player, I can understand if you feel left out of Thrall’s story arc. Thrall feels like “their guy,” and Thrall’s journey over the last couple of years may not feel like “your” story, even if his mistakes are about to send the whole world into a potential death spiral. Fair enough. Stick with Thrall as he fulfills his destiny at the end of Cataclysm, and I promise we’ll catch up with other characters -- from both factions -- as we pick up the pieces in the aftermath.<br />
<br />
Garrosh Hellscream has a vision for the Horde, a vision of a united Kalimdor that can only be realized over the ashes of the Alliance. He’s craftier than any of his foes realize, and his grim determination to win at all costs -- even at the expense of his own people -- is plunging the world into chaos.<br />
<br />
In the midst of this crisis, the Alliance is going to need to pull together like never before. At the BlizzCon lore panel we promised that key Alliance characters are going to get more time in the spotlight throughout Mists and the subsequent patches, and I wanted to reiterate that here. They’re going to come out of this stronger than ever, but the road ahead won’t be easy.<br />
<br />
It’s going to get worse before it gets better. A lot worse. But that’s a good thing. It means we’re going to need a lot more heroes to bring justice to an unjust world. We’re going to need you to step up and reshape the world.<br />
<br />
Just don’t expect a Happily Ever After. We just don’t do those here.<br />

I'm pretty sure a lot of this was to prep alliance players for the destruction of Theramore, which was already leaked as the pre-MoP event. I just hope they let the alliance shoot back at the horde.</div></div><hr />

Yep, realms like that are fairly common now. Other examples of lopsided progression realms include Mal'Ganis, Mug'thol, and Cho'gall.<br />

They are not sorry for it, just sorry we cared so much.There is absolutley a Horde favortism this isnt just a few cooky conspiracy people coming out of tthe woodwork, this is millions of people seeing this problem.

Say one thing here, and in the game it's a completely different story. There's been no follow up to the Dwarven civil war past some short story out of the game, no more interaction between the faction leaders of the Horde and Alliance since WotlK, no follow up from the developments of Cairne's assassination, Garrosh and the Horde / Alliance conflict in Kalimdor and the Forsaken / Gilneas line, there was a small part of Vol'jin seperating his Darkspear from the other troll tribes in Rise of the Zandalari but... that's pretty much it. There's actually been very little consistancy or follow up content or half of what people expected and it feels a bit meh now. You level up and this shit is all but mostly forgotten 9 months down the line until MoP comes out and now what.. the Horde in Kalimdor go on a rampage and Garrosh has yet another U-turn of character despite quests in Cata making him to be a more honourable and less reckless leader than demonstrated in WotLK? WotLK was actually quite good for the Alliance in general; Arthas, a stain on general humanity, was moved out of the picture and Tirion - a little known npc back in Vanilla due to a book - became one of the most prominent characters in the game, brought the Ashbringer back into the spotlight and the whole Paladin shebang, and the Bronzebeards being reunited and their links to Ulduar revealed.. as well as the humans and gnomes history too. There's not enough going on to keep an engrossing story going on right now, you got that right.</div></div><hr />

I don't think this has anything to do with faction imbalance. If progression guilds happen to be one faction or the other is just coincidence, unless people have flocked to those servers because a &quot;popular&quot; guild of a certain faction resides there. Blood Legion comes to mind on Illidan-US.</div></div><hr />

<br />
except, alliance has NEVER won, not int he game of world of warcraft, they had victories prior to wow but in Wow horde have won every battle. And alliance is shown as imcompitent and incapable of winning even smallest of battles when THEY have the advantage. Just look at stonard.<br />
<br />
and like other posters have said. This post didn't say anything except &quot;the horde always win, because that's what we feel they deserve, for their hardships&quot;. They ignore the fact dranor was shared with the orcs. They forget the alliance has suffered losses too.<br />
<br />
And the arguments that it's just a game? try to imagine the next twilight movie where the dudes are alliance/horde, and only one of them ever wins, ever. All the upset people rooting for other dude. You gonna say &quot;it's just a movie&quot;? Maybe a poor example but same principle, fiction has it's fans, people play the game for lore too. It isn't just about logging in and queueing a dungeon/raid and collecting loot for everyone.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ya, this is like lighting a stick of tnt and then sticking it in your mouth and then burying yourself in the grave you just recently dug. There is absolutely no way this can turn into any positive. Fact of the matter is that with Thrall being the pet hero of the people in charge of lore for WoW, the Horde got lots of extra attention. When Thrall stepped down from Warchief, they had to make the new Warchief, who was already a hot tempered warmonger, even more of an agressive warmonger, in order to gain the &quot;respect&quot; of the Horde. There has been way too much blatant favoritism to the Horde and anyone who claims otherwise is obviously blind. Rather than correct the issue, they're just going to exasperate it further, blame it on story telling, and not even recover the slack. Unless Orgrimmar gets razed in an Alliance counterattack and Thrall puts a mace through Garrosh's skull in the confusion and retakes the Horde, no one is going to be satisfied. As for Garrosh's vision of uniting all of Kalimdor for the Horde, how off can Blizz's own team be about the characters THEY write? It has been made painfully obvious to both factions that Garrosh doesn't just want Kalimdor, he wants the entirety of Azeroth. The only difference between Garrosh's Horde and the Horde from WC1 and 2 is that Garrosh and his soldiers aren't under the influence of demon blood while butchering and massacring civilians and cities. To those who say Stonetalon wasn't Garrosh's orders, that is only one instance where Garrosh acted half compassionate and accountable for his actions. His actions are what caused the massacre in Stonetalon and I think he was more upset with the loss of members of the Horde and the infighting than he was about a school of druids being incinerated. What about the Northern part of the East Kingdoms, like Lorderon, where he told the Forsaken to not use any plague, but didn't have any qualms about the butchering of civilians of Gilneas? What about the members of the Kirin Tor and Dalaran that housed and assisted his Horde in Northrend against Malygos, Yog'saron, and the Lich King?<br />
<br />
Garrosh's Horde and the old Horde are way too similar, but Garrosh's Horde has no excuse for their actions. They are clear minded in every action they've made so far, making their actions all the more unacceptable. Grom is probably turning over in his grave over the monster his son has become. Mannoroth would have loved to have an orc like Garrosh under his influence when he tainted the Horde.</div></div><hr />

I will say this though: the current Horde fanbase seem to have a vaccuum of 'normal' people. They are either super nice and intelligent, or dribbling morons. Horde seems to attract both extremes, and Alliance is the 'safe choice'.<br />

Also, a big questline that everyone does at the beginning of 4.2 that revolves around Thrall, that was pretty much impossible to get into because Thrall's just some Orc to my toon. I couldn't stop wondering why my toon was helping this greenskin. Sure, he's supposed to be part of the Earthen Ring or something like that, but there was never even any attempt to get the Alliance to buy in. It was just, well he's Thrall so I should follow him, right?</div></div><hr />

The thing is I actually enjoy the novels and comics because of the epic story advancement they give in the World of Warcraft. But such important events that have taken place in say, the Thrall or Wolfheart novels, should at least be reflected in-game somehow. I would prefer to have side-plots take place in the novels, kinda like what they are doing with the new WoW comics where they have a group of Horde and Alliance teams doing things. Something that doesn't detract from what the game should be doing and instead enhancing it's overall plot.</div></div><hr />

This is likely true. But as I said in the edit, that makes the Horde dead man walking.<br />
<br />
Those teenage MW3 fanbois love to join the winning side, even better if it's evil. So Horde will be influxed with morons next expansion and Alliance with smart refugees from the Horde.</div></div><hr />

Many, if not all, PvP servers are Horde dominant. 2. Horde seems (note I said seems before ppl go off) to win a lot of battlegrounds. 3. The Horde seem to have the players that are more vocal and have faction &quot;pride&quot; 4. Paladins were NOT a good class when they were Alliance only 5. Racials, 'nuff said. 6. Current state of Thrall based lore. As a side note: Let's just be honest, if an employee that is lead anything has his wife screaming &quot;For the Horde&quot; out the window at random people isn't evidence enough, then what is?</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you play PvP based games, hate the carebare aspect, and want to look like a badass, the answer is horde. Alliance has &quot;cute gnomes&quot; and dwarves, while the horde have tauran, orcs with unreasonably large pauldrons, undead with their headbanging /dance, and blood elves with their &quot;I wanted to be alliance, but I didn't want to be a carebare&quot; feel to it. Meanwhile, human males have a poor animation quality, draenie swing two-handers like a golf club, and gnome rogues have pink hair.<br />
<br />
And when making this decision when you are first playing the game, would you rather have &quot;Gnomes can get out of snares&quot;, or the orc's &quot;Increases your melee and casting speed by 20%&quot;...? Or tauran's AoE stun?Alliance racials are defensive, which are great if you're losing...? Horde racials are all offensive, and two of them are even AoE.<br />
<br />
PS: I don't care either way. I play a gnome mage and raid twice a week. That's it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">greyghost</div><div class="date">2011-11-25, 09:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My only problem with the faction rivalry they encourage is that it makes it so that someone who plays Alliance tends to feel unsafe at even official gatherings for WoW, including (especially) Blizzcon. <br />
<br />
What was I supposed to feel when a 6'2&quot; 300 pound mountain of ham ran up and screamed &quot;DIE ALLIANCE FAGGOT&quot; in my face, as someone who is a LGBT supporter and plays both factions? Pride for my Horde dalliances, or wish that I wasn't made to leave my pepper spray at the security check? <br />
<br />
There is an acceptable amount of factionism that should be allowed in a community, but Blizzard toes that line and frequently crosses it. In fact, the example that the blue post mentions is where I would say the line is crossed. Yes, I'm certain that that person was terrified that he got screamed at by someone that then revved up their engine and likely drove recklessly away. Is it funny? I guess it is for the perpetrator. But even if that person WAS a die-hard Horde fan, it's likely that they were terrified nonetheless. Screaming at someone out in an empty lot from a car is something rarely done in a friendly manner. <br />
<br />
You could argue that words are words. And in fact, the brush-off I see from people who are okay with this is that the people bothered by it should &quot;grow thicker skin&quot;. That could work for some people, but for most it can't be ignored, and it shouldn't. In fact, I find it reprehensible that bullying be promoted in a community where most people playing the game are attempting to escape their real life problems/work/school. There has been more research than ever lately into the effects of bullying, showing that kids who are bullied have higher rates of suicide and other mental health issues. It is difficult to argue with such statistics, and impossible to brush it off as people being 'thin-skinned'. Bullying is a serious problem that Blizzard needs to step up and address.<br />
<br />
Consider, then, if a 15-year-old who is bullied in school attempts to forget the horrors he goes through each day by playing WoW... only to wind up being bullied for playing a Human Warrior or Draenei Shaman should that child be lucky enough to attend Blizzcon. I don't think the word 'heartbreak' can begin to encapsulate the betrayal that child will feel.<br />
<br />
And then there's the issue of people conflating bigotry against homosexuals with Alliance-bashing. That's just a whole other can of worms, and I'm certain that there's been posts already where there's been people going &quot;Oh geez, I guess they wanted to shut up more people whining about the Blizzcon Cannibal Corpse incident god stupid Alliance still whining about that lol&quot;. All I can hope in that regard is that when those people grow up, they can at least atone for their actions by actively discouraging bigotry whenever they encounter it.</div></div><hr />

But as soon as an ad with a horde t-shirt appeared threads about Horde favouritism cropped up. I think it's just a never ending reiterating topic for the Alliance forum members, that will never end. Frankly as a Horde I'm jealous of the level of detail SW and IF were given in comparison to the Horde capitals. It is as if they started the game putting in neat wandering NPCs and exploding sheep for SW and then realised that they had the rest of the game to complete and cheaped out on the Horde.</div></div><hr />

The horde racials and badass looks and bla bla bla is there because... well... They are more badass and more aggressive than ally is and they have always been that. I dont care about it at all, it is just how it is and if one dont like it then stop playing wow. So what if people want those &quot;perfect&quot; racials and/or professions just to be top notch trust me on this one, for a good player that doesn't matter. <br />

It's nice that Blizz have come out and admitted favouritism, which I'm glad about after all of the people moaning that there was no favouritism and that Alliance should stop whining, so to that Thank You Blizz, that case can be closed and now the debate on how the balance can be restored will begin, rather than if it needs balanced in the first place.<br />
<br />
Still though i disagree about having expansions favouring one faction as they hinted, i would love it if each patch bought with it a change in the war rather playing an entire expansion knowing that everywhere you look your faction is losing. The next expansion will not be focusing on 1-60 content so i would imagine that Ashenvale will remain a Horde dominated zone which is a true shame, the poor NE's do very little in the game besides helping the Cenarion circle - which is neutral. It is their ancestral land and due to Cata's Horde favouritism appears to be a very one sided fight despite the fact last time it was invaded the Horde only won because they recorrupted themselves because they were being obliterated.</div></div><hr />

This ugly plague came about a year ago when suddenly people in the Alliance were corrupted and reappeared in Org. It almost wiped them out completely.

The Horde could literally take over Stormwind and the Alliance wouldn't notice except for the guards. Tol Barad is commonly fought 5v5.

Come on, dog. Look I know bullying is a problem that needs to be addressed, but a lot of it is also that people need to nut up. No one should be terrified because some dumb chick screamed a video game battle cry out a window. If some 300 lb Horde porker rushes you screaming faggot, you plant one across his jaw, gut him, and kick him while he's down. I can guarantee you eating pizza puffs til you're 300+ doesn't make you good at fighting. If Alliance players are sick of this Horde attitude, they need to fight back.</div></div><hr />

Honestly what lore development has the Alliance gotten since wow started? Two big parts of Alliance lore, Paladins and Druids, were basically stripped from us and turned into neutral factions. The Draenei and Worgen were introduced and all but forgotten 5 seconds later. Alot of the redone zones are the same old story with new text, or just pop culture references. I havent seen anything for the Alliance that made me go &quot;Wow thats awesome for the Alliance&quot; in a long long time. And thats the problem. I have absolutely no reason to care about the Alliance at this point, because nothing ever happens with it. It exists to be the Hordes punching bag, and with what they said I dont really see that changing any time soon. If they wait too long to actually do something cool for the Alliance, no one will even play the Alliance anymore for it to matter.<br />
<br />
Edit: I also dont want to see just another Warcraft II ending, where the Horde pushes the Alliance to the brink of destruction, and &quot;in their darkest hour they rally and push the Horde back to win.&quot; Thats boring, and has been done before. Do something new.</div></div><hr />

Nope Thrall will continue to wander and try to be a peace ambassador (like working out peace between palestine and Israel [ya right]). Garrosh will be killed by either leader of tauren or leader of the trolls, and either of those two races will be the new leaders of the Horde. The orcs for the next 3 expansions after will be the dirt of the horde, the shame race brought by Garrosh.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have sympathy for them, early WoW did not really have much story telling mechanics for the main characters, and whilst it has gotten a bit better they still can only focus on one storyline at a time, leaving the rest of the world in stasis. Unfortunately, the MMORPG genre just isn't as adept at storytelling as others. That was my biggest regret with WoW. It neutered the storyline, forced them to manipulate it in a negative way for gameplay reasons, and has prevented Warcraft 4. <br />
<br />
If it wasn't for WoW and the necessity of drawing a line in the sand and making every formidable race choose one side or the other, we'd still have a multi-faceted storyline. I.E the Night Elves being just as hostile to the Alliance as they were to the Horde. The Forsaken having no true allies and the Blood Elves prefering demons and Naga to the Horde.</div></div><hr />

Garrosh will be killed by either leader of tauren or leader of the trolls, and either of those two races will be the new leaders of the Horde. The orcs for the next 3 expansions after will be the dirt of the horde, the shame race brought by Garrosh.<br />
<br />
I personally love this idea. What most people forget is that &quot;The Horde&quot; is not defined by Orcs, nor is &quot;The Alliance&quot; defined by humans; they're collective, and every single race within can and should have the potential to run for leadership. To see the Orcs and Humans endure a humbling fall from grace would be truly fascinating and refreshing; the factions instead lead by, let's say, Vol'Jin for the Horde and Velen for the Alliance (the two &quot;wisest&quot; leaders of both factions, perhaps). But given what Blizzard has spewed out lately, such a thing would be too much for their simple-minded story-writers to bear; &quot;More wars!&quot;</div></div><hr />

I see an admission of what caused the appearance of Horde bias in the past, and a promise to do better in the future. Remember the guy writing this is the author of a webcomic with an Alliance main character.<br />
<br />
It took 5 years to get to where we are. How long is this &quot;future&quot; going to take?<br />
<br />
Is their answer to their mistakes really the awful, suddenly dropped in from space nobody Varian? He was a douchebag for half of the time he was in the game so far, so he's forced on to us as our supposed hero? Jaina that's been idle for 5 years? Is she going to suddenly fall out of the sky too and suddenly do something? Nah jk she's Thrall's sympathizer, i'm surprised they didn't make her bed Thrall.<br />

Cross-faction communication was banned outright, even where it made little or no sense in the lore. Entire realms are dedicated to PvP. Battlegrounds and quest hubs feature prominent Alliance and Horde iconography. We want to foster a sense of factional pride, a real identity with your brothers and sisters in arms. We want players to be proud of their faction, even at the expense of personal dignity. /rant Sorry but that's utter bull crap. Blizzard destroyed the bit of &quot;healthy rivalry&quot; and if it &quot;was&quot; an early design goal, it certainly isn't one now anymore - I doubt that will change much no matter what they say about Mists of Kungfu Pandaria. Battlegrounds/Arena is simply not the right thing. Blizzard was slooooooowly going the right way with 1k-Winter, but then they misinterpeted the PvE tie and then we had the crappy 2hrs waiting for a quick switch and of course a stupid treat of gathering xyz marks. $$$ and Marketing-wise, it works, but for those very few who like warcraft for the warcraft it once was? =&gt; nope.avi Sure, people still play and stuff, but I find I must simply shred that comment of that dude. Sure, people will say &quot;For the Whored!&quot; (;D) or whatever tagline the alliance has as usual... but don't call it factional pride. People who ever played Daoc prior to the ToA addon will know what true faction/realm pride is. WoW doesn't have true &quot;faction pride&quot; ! Not period -- EXCLAMATION MARK! :D</div></div><hr />

How are you an after thought?<br />
<br />
The Forsaken that you say are devastated by the Lich King goes ahead and kills one of the most iconic Alliance WoW heroes in Bolvar. So for an expansion you claim is written for the Alliance, you have your after thought, devastated race kill off our guy. np. Makes sense, you're an after thought.<br />
<br />
Horde for some reason view Tyrion as an Alliance hero simply because he's human. Is Medivh an Alliance hero even though he's the one that brought Orcs through the Dark Portal?<br />
<br />
You say Blood Elves are an after thought. What are the Draenei doing in Wrath? What is either side doing outside of the Argent Crusade which is open to both factions?<br />

Burning Legion =/ Forsaken. And Saurfang the Younger was also killed as well. People forget that since he became a inconsequential raid boss as opposed to the new Lich King.<br />

How does that explain the Worgen not getting the prio-mentioned &quot;Worgen District&quot; in Stormwind?

How does that explain why the entire finale to the Worgen/Gilneas storyline can ONLY be told via the Horde side?! <br />

How does this explain Orgrimmar getting a literally ground-up remake, complete with elevators, an airport, a Tauren district and a built-up Troll district and it's own bad-ass brand-new musical score... and Stormwind gets a wedding gazebo and a really large-ass graveyard, while loosing the park? <br />

No - there wasn't a quest involving returning him to SW. There was SUPOSED to be one... but it was never completed. (and you wonder why there is anger in the Alliance?)<br />
<br />
It was, instead, a story told in a series of comic books. Never in the game did they explain it. All that happened was when patch 3.0 appeared - a gigantic anime-looking barbarian with a massive chin appeared in front of a goofy throne in Stormwind Keep.</div></div><hr />

No? You obviously have never been Alliance. The &quot;returning him to Stormwind&quot; quest never actually completed. The &quot;king&quot; in Stormwind was always a boy-aged son Anduin until Cataclysm.<br />

Recycling? Just like Daenei lore ;P. They shouldn't have changed it in the first place, it would have been so much more interesting, if the Draenei would have still been considered evil by the Space nazis (Titans).</div></div><hr />

I believe Metzen said at one point that the Draenei lore was, in essence, &quot;A train wreck.&quot; Trust Blizzard come up with a race that is millions of years old, and give them less lore than any other race, never mind their Sin'dorei counterparts who have been around for only a few generations.</div></div><hr />

From what I understand, he was still the faction leader at the time, and got captured. How would you respond if you were captured and held in a prison cell? Besides it wasn't until after that he relinquished his leadership (at least according to all of the quest text referencing him still as warchief).</div></div><hr />

Cross-faction communication was banned outright, even where it made little or no sense in the lore. Entire realms are dedicated to PvP. Battlegrounds and quest hubs feature prominent Alliance and Horde iconography. We want to foster a sense of factional pride, a real identity with your brothers and sisters in arms.<br />
<br />
We want players to be proud of their faction, even at the expense of personal dignity.<br />
<br />
<br />
/rant<br />
Sorry but that's utter bull crap.<br />
<br />
Blizzard destroyed the bit of &quot;healthy rivalry&quot; and if it &quot;was&quot; an early design goal, it certainly isn't one now anymore - I doubt that will change much no matter what they say about Mists of Kungfu Pandaria. Battlegrounds/Arena is simply not the right thing. Blizzard was slooooooowly going the right way with 1k-Winter, but then they misinterpeted the PvE tie and then we had the crappy 2hrs waiting for a quick switch and of course a stupid treat of gathering xyz marks. <br />
$$$ and Marketing-wise, it works, <br />
but for those very few who like warcraft for the warcraft it once was?<br />
=&gt; nope.avi <br />
<br />
Sure, people still play and stuff, but I find I must simply shred that comment of that dude.<br />
<br />
Sure, people will say &quot;For the Whored!&quot; (;D) or whatever tagline the alliance has as usual... but don't call it factional pride.<br />
People who ever played Daoc prior to the ToA addon will know what true faction/realm pride is.<br />

They tend to go hand in hand though. Thrall has always been neutral; when it suited him. Deep down, and we've seen it in so many instances, he's not as different from Garrosh as he likes to think himself; even in the Firelands on the last part of the chain where we free him from the Twilight curse, we still see that he maintains grudges from waaay back, such as with Blackmoore. We'll see how much of a &quot;save the world&quot; guy he is, when he's saved the world.</div></div><hr />

The Lost Isles in general are a total lore train-wreck.<br />

By the time he returned to Azeroth with Aggra, he had already set aside the mantle of Warchief. Yet for some reason he decided that sailing under Horde colors, with an entirely Orcish crew was a good idea at a time when the Earthen Ring were already recognized by the Alliance as being neutral.<br />
<br />
Then there's the whole question of why the Alliance even wanted to capture him with, as the captain put it, &quot;no witnesses&quot;. If they didn't know of Thrall's current mission, they would of wanted to shout his capture to every corner of Azeroth. If they did know of Thrall's current mission, why did they want to capture him at all?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Easy now. Given his pro-Alliance stance I'd say he's an Alliance player and didn't do the Horde side of the chain.<br />
<br />
The Alliance side of the battle was constructed so the Alliance got the impression it was all the Forsaken who did it. They fought the dead to get to Putress and killed him.<br />
<br />
The Horde side went in from another entrance and fought the splinter faction of Forsaken as well as demons, culminating in a fight against Varimathas, who is revealed to have been the 'mastermind' behind the plot. &quot;A mysterious voice&quot; yells at him for failing it from the Nether, before Varimathas is defeated (he'll be back). THEN, after neutralising the demon threat, Varian shows up, blames the Forsaken, and gets teleported away before any context can be given (not that he'd have listened to it).<br />
<br />
<br />
Are the Forsaken perfect? Hell no, they are a bunch of pricks who have forgotten their previous lives and seek dominance. Were they responsible for the Wrathgate incident? No, that was Varimathas and his crew of traitors he took years preparing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I honestly hope that they do bring more Alliance heroes to the forefront. All we have are a statue king, a prophet who hides in his glowing city, a tree hugging sentinel, a top-hat wearing wolf-gentleman, a crazed gnome gadgeteer, and an arrogant ponytail boy. I hope we see Varian and Tyrande at least actually do brutal, heart-wrenching, world-changing things (screw Velen, Greymane and Mekkatorque). And I hope that Magni is uncursed and takes his place again as a powerful leader within the Alliance.<br />
<br />
<br />
War is about winning and losing. Both sides cannot win in a war. Alliance might get beaten this round in MoP. But who knows what the next expansion will bring. And stop crying about racial crap. Alliance are far more OP in that case.<br />
<br />
I think it's more an issue of faction leaders and powerful heroes actually having story. I personally don't care who has what &quot;racials&quot; or who is the stronger faction and thus gains more victories or more land. But it gets weary as year after year, Blizzard highlight the Horde and their myriad storylines simply because most of the developers prefer to play the more beastly, powerful faction. Take Fargo's story for instance. Not only does he have a loopy wife, but he proved that they care more about Horde - and as a result, Horde get deeper lore and more powerful experiences time and time again.<br />
<br />
Which is why I said that I honestly hope we see more emotional, world-changing things that actually involve Alliance for once. Even if that means that Garrosh destroys Theramore or one of the Alliance faction leaders comes to a sticky end. I love all the stories in the game and all the multitudinous mini plotlines that we follow through questing and exploration. But within the main, overarching story of Alliance vs Horde, it would be neat to have a decent Alliance hero for once.</div></div><hr />

This. Take a look at Silverpine compared to Westfall/Redridge. Silverpine is an awesome questing zone, with lots of new story and quests. Westfall is the same old storyline, just with updated quest text more or less. Redridge is one gigantic pop culture reference, although the questing itself is fun, from a lore standpoint its terrible. The only early zone for Alliance they did well was Darkshore, and it was incredibly depressing, but thats a good thing. It was a great questing experience. Ashenvale is similar to Westfall, its all the same old quests just slightly updated, if even that. Its like they didnt even try hard for the Alliance side of the quests.</div></div><hr />

Man, this is awesome :) I'm one of those who did see the story around Thrall and why it mattered so much, because I've always been a Thrall fan. And even if certain choices in the story are onces I disagree with, it is still awesome to see the kind of depth and inner termoil Thrall faced on a day to day struggle with his feelings and desires and angers. People didn't see it, and that just shows to me a lack of apprectiation from the playerbase along with everything else.</div></div><hr />

They fled numerous worlds to escape the demons! The orcs only lost one. That is all from Rise of the Horde by Christie Golden. If you want to debate it's continuity, we do it in Nagrand atop Oshu'gun. Why? Because Oshu'gun didn't exist until Christie Golden put it in the book. Or if you want a more comfortable zone, we could go to hellfire peninsula, where I can point out the draenei bones from the quest, giving some proof outside the book.<br />
Yes I am a big fan of the draenei lore. I'm fine with them not having any progression because I like the past lore so much. What I'm not fine with is when they ignore that lore so they can argue the Orcs had it worse!<br />
<br />
I don't care that horde have more zones, or that thrall is the center piece, because those things pass, we move on. Hell, I'm even looking forward to the destruction of Theramore because of the possibilities it brings. (bad questing zone. hate it much, but that is beside the point.) 1. Jaina's possible death. If Jaina dies there, Varian loses the restraint. Plus it gives him a good reason to counter attack. 2. The former guardian who was living with Jaina re-enters the world as the Alliance's mage hero, and proceeds to kick ass. or 3. Brings Kul Tiras back into the war as the alliance's navy.However, the only likely one is Jaina dying, but that is now unlikely because they don't want to appear to be horde favoring.</div></div><hr />

Of course Sylvanas knew about it.<br />

But if an American war minister stole a nuke and bombed an enemy city of his own choosing, would all United States citizens deserve to be persecuted?<br />
<br />
Sylvanas trying to commit suicide in her leader story suggests she had no intention whatsoever of actually using the plague on anyone other than the Scourge. Her over-ruling desire was to see the Lich King defeated by any means. Varimathas didn't really &quot;jump the gun&quot;, he used it in a situation without her orders in a way that was devastating to their chances of defeating the Lich King. Sylvanas would never be so foolish as to launch an attack on the living before the Lich King was defeated, and her actions after his defeat show she probably wouldn't have cared about using it on the living anyway.</div></div><hr />

If they didn't know of Thrall's current mission, they would of wanted to shout his capture to every corner of Azeroth. If they did know of Thrall's current mission, why did they want to capture him at all?<br />

There is an acceptable amount of factionism that should be allowed in a community, but Blizzard toes that line and frequently crosses it. In fact, the example that the blue post mentions is where I would say the line is crossed. Yes, I'm certain that that person was terrified that he got screamed at by someone that then revved up their engine and likely drove recklessly away. Is it funny? I guess it is for the perpetrator. But even if that person WAS a die-hard Horde fan, it's likely that they were terrified nonetheless. Screaming at someone out in an empty lot from a car is something rarely done in a friendly manner. <br />
<br />
You could argue that words are words. And in fact, the brush-off I see from people who are okay with this is that the people bothered by it should &quot;grow thicker skin&quot;. That could work for some people, but for most it can't be ignored, and it shouldn't. In fact, I find it reprehensible that bullying be promoted in a community where most people playing the game are attempting to escape their real life problems/work/school. There has been more research than ever lately into the effects of bullying, showing that kids who are bullied have higher rates of suicide and other mental health issues. It is difficult to argue with such statistics, and impossible to brush it off as people being 'thin-skinned'. Bullying is a serious problem that Blizzard needs to step up and address.<br />
<br />
Consider, then, if a 15-year-old who is bullied in school attempts to forget the horrors he goes through each day by playing WoW... only to wind up being bullied for playing a Human Warrior or Draenei Shaman should that child be lucky enough to attend Blizzcon. I don't think the word 'heartbreak' can begin to encapsulate the betrayal that child will feel.<br />
<br />
And then there's the issue of people conflating bigotry against homosexuals with Alliance-bashing. That's just a whole other can of worms, and I'm certain that there's been posts already where there's been people going &quot;Oh geez, I guess they wanted to shut up more people whining about the Blizzcon Cannibal Corpse incident god stupid Alliance still whining about that lol&quot;. All I can hope in that regard is that when those people grow up, they can at least atone for their actions by actively discouraging bigotry whenever they encounter it.<br />

Not buying it. Thrall is Horde, period. He started it, he ran it, he left it. And somehow I'm not supposed to knife him in the back when he says something that seems peaceful in a language the Horde doesn't speak normally? He put a barbarian in charge of what he started so he could pursue peace. Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, DUMB. If there was more to interact with him in the game and learn something I'd be more open to it, but it was in a book. I don't pay to play a game that requires me to have to purchase books to read backstory, sidestory, or the %$^#$% current story to keep up. Yeah, Draenor got blown up. Alliance didn't do that, someone else did. And last I checked that place was still level 70, so take your 85-elite faction leaders and take it back for all I care. I'm sick of them touting the Horde up as the underdog that's fighting for acceptance and a place to call home. NO ONE is the underdog if they outnumber the other group or are more popular than the other group. Some servers the Horde greatly outnumber the Alliance, they're not the underdog on those servers for sure. They're trying to keep them balanced as both sides being good and both being bad, but it just doesn't work for me. Take one side and spin them into the darkest levels of evil you can and polarize the two. Just stop trying to play the Horde as the misunderstood gang member in some kind of &quot;High School Musical&quot; after-school special. Some people are just bad, and someone in this fight has to just be bad.</div></div><hr />

This is true. While the lore looks like junk, so long as it doesn't translate into making the game harder for Alliance and easier for Horde (by having fewer questing areas) we won't notice it at all. In fact, this may be a bonus to our quality of life.</div></div><hr />

By this point it's not something they're going to be able to fix with explanations of why they don't think it's as bad as we do, half-hearted apologies, and vague promises that maybe MoP will be different. It's good that they're at least acknowledging it, that's more than we got with Cata (where they falsely reassured us that despite all evidence to the contrary Cata wasn't Horde biased, only to eventually admit it was once we'd all bought it) but most Alliance players are at the &quot;fool me twice...&quot; stage, and until we start seeing actual evidence that things are changing we have no reason to believe they actually are.</div></div><hr />

By the time he returned to Azeroth with Aggra, he had already set aside the mantle of Warchief.

It's pretty obvious he let them capture him so he could kill the all later. After all soon after he's release he destroys the entire fleet without any problem. It makes you wonder how was he captured in the first place if he's that powerful.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Um...what<br />
<br />
I give you vanilla<br />
Tbc-I'm still waiting for a reason why the alliance didn't close the portal after thrall walked through it. Horde had the better questing and had actual results at the end of it all. Alliance quests were pointless and didn't even bring anything in the end. I can't think of a single quest in outlands that left me with &quot;The alliance is awesome&quot; feeling. Don't forget that outlands was the place the orcs came from so to call it an alliance centered expansion means you either are blind or can't read. Don't forget 2.4 centered around the blood elves...a horde faction.<br />
Wrath-I still don't see how this was alliance centered. We both lost an important hero but neither side really gained anything, arthas was a threat to all. Wrath was easily the most balanced of the expansions in terms of side pride.<br />
Cata-Horde centric to a massive degree. If asked why I stopped playing this game one of the reasons would be faction balance.</div></div><hr />

I completely agree.<br />
<br />
Like I have said several times before, the current lore is made of developers thinking this seems cool, and then having the story department cover their insanity. The only bits of really well-thought out lore are Horde sided. Everything else is just a joke. Wolfheart is laughable. Thrall going Jesus Mode On way too fast and overshadowing both Deathwing (Aspects were the strongest creatures in Azeroth after Old Gods...), and Malfurion (who used to be the most powerful mortal character in lore) is just absurd. Thrall in WC3 was excellent, but the Thrall we got in WoW was more like Yeah, I want peace, but I am not really enforcing such peace, and if orcs misbehave, I am so sorry!. And he did the same thing when he decided that Garrosh should be in charge instead of Cairne, for instance. The whole 'Garrosh thing haunting Thrall' is just as artificial as Thrall choosing Garrosh over other potentially better Horde leaders to begin with.<br />
<br />
We just do not have any new enemies. Everything is Old Gods this, Old Gods that, heroes going insane or being corrupted. It is such a shameful thing.<br />
<br />
The Alliance was a coalition, not an 'empire'. Varian becoming High King of the Alliance, akin to a a Warchief, commanding all? That is beyond ridiculous. Alliance faction leaders, and races, are much better than that. They want to make Alliance and the Horde like mirrors to each other. It is pitiful.<br />
<br />
Sadly, Warcraft's lore seems frozen in time. Up until WotLK, they still had some plot hooks they could use. After that, it seems like they went okay, now what?, and Metzen, Knaak, 'in-game' developers and such created this travesty that is the current lore. Such a pity. The RPG books turned out to be 'better canon' :(</div></div><hr />

This. 100%. For Both Factions.<br />
<br />
I understand a Wanted board, but if I'm being sent somewhere 'important,' like Uldum, at least throw me a bone and give me a reason to care. They did it right with Twilight Highlands, especially the Alliance questline with Anduin and the whole throne room 'mini invasion.' They don't need to do that with every area (a throne invasion), but at least have Varian, or one of his main lackeys send us off. <br />
<br />
And to the 'faction balance,' this is another thing I miss about Wrath. Up until the end, everything seemed fair and balanced. No side really won Wrath, because, really, we both did. Or, the Ashen Verdict did, with our help. <br />
<br />
I'm getting the sense that the Horde won Cataclysm. That's fine by me. You guys can have the worst expansion to date. You can also take our Worgen away, too. But we get the Pandas. Just us. No Pandas for you. <br />
<br />
As long as, in the end, the Alliance gets our turn (next expansion :D), I'm good. <br />
<br />
Hopefully the 'winning' is done with Shalamayne stuck in Garrosh's skull.</div></div><hr />

You are sooo far off the mark, while at the same time you have a good point.<br />
<br />
The problem with your post is that you completely miss the entire point of the wanted board (or choose to ignore it).<br />
It's visible to anyone as soon as they merely pop into town. The king is not. He's hidden away in a large castle located in a remote part of the city, that players aren't as likely to visit. The board serves it's purpose.<br />
<br />
That said, you are right in your constructive observation - getting the mission from the king would be more meaningful. Perhaps a solution would be for the board to tell us to go see the king, who would then give us the &quot;go to this zone&quot;-mission? That would be a compromise taking the best aspect of the board, and combining it with the best part of your suggestion... Although I can hear the criticism already: &quot;That seems like an awfully needless trip just to be told where to go. Why couldn't that information just be posted on the board?&quot;...</div></div><hr />

<br />
People have been complaining about faction favoritism since the game began, but it would not be an exaggeration to say it's at an all-time high right now. Hell, even a lot of Horde players are beginning to admit the Alliance needs a break (at least as far as the story is concerned). Ignoring the problem isn't going to make it go away. Acknowledging it at least gives them some good PR, even if they don't intend to actually do anything about it.</div></div><hr />

Dude, QFT. I concur. These kids need to grow up and actually read what's being said without being socially awkward/inept. It's like they don't even care that a dev is taking time to figuratively prop their elbow on a water cooler and shoot the shit with us about lore. <br />
<br />
On topic, I've been Alliance since the release of this game and have never felt like the story wasn't driving to a destination, even if it wasn't &quot;my guy&quot; doing the driving. I don't know, I guess I can sit back and look at this game's story for what it is as an impartial observer just as much as I can partake in it and root for &quot;my side&quot;. I've always loved how the writers create rising and falling action with crazy climax moments in this game as well as the supplemental material like the comics and the tabletop games. Did anyone read the first run of the comics? Varian is a bad-ass gladiator mofo with yey, a mighty pimp hand! His story unfolded quite a bit in that arc and into/through WotLK and even though he's been kind of relegated to a reactionary second-tier character for the moment, I get the feeling he's about to tear some new asses in MoP.<br />
<br />
Now, do the writers at Blizzard focus on Horde a lot? Yes, but that's because WoW has been largely Thrall's story up to this point, and ya know what? I'm perfectly fine with that. That dude could wear the mantle of the Alliance and we'd never know he changed factions. He's justice incarnate. Do for him, and he will do for you. An Orc of the People - all people. What he does is for the good of the planet and all it's inhabitants, not for his own personal gain. I really dig that. Even as a die-hard Alliance member (I will never wear a Horde hoodie - Alliance for Life) I can still see that the bigger picture is what's important, and that bigger picture is a good story.</div></div><hr />

People need to stop complaining about factions being unfair. Seriously, in game it's a damn war at this point, war is -never- fair. Yes, I'm on the loosing side, I take it out on the horde in game :D<br />

Face it, they are lazy. They didn't give the Alliance enough story telling in Cata, how is it fair to Alliance players that paid $40 and got zero story while the Horde Players paid $40 and got more interesting lore and story telling.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Like I have said several times before, the current lore is made of developers thinking this seems cool, and then having the story department cover their insanity. The only bits of really well-thought out lore are Horde sided. Everything else is just a joke. Wolfheart is laughable. Thrall going Jesus Mode On way too fast and overshadowing both Deathwing (Aspects were the strongest creatures in Azeroth after Old Gods...), and Malfurion (who used to be the most powerful mortal character in lore) is just absurd. Thrall in WC3 was excellent, but the Thrall we got in WoW was more like Yeah, I want peace, but I am not really enforcing such peace, and if orcs misbehave, I am so sorry!. And he did the same thing when he decided that Garrosh should be in charge instead of Cairne, for instance. The whole 'Garrosh thing haunting Thrall' is just as artificial as Thrall choosing Garrosh over other potentially better Horde leaders to begin with.<br />
<br />
We just do not have any new enemies. Everything is Old Gods this, Old Gods that, heroes going insane or being corrupted. It is such a shameful thing.<br />
<br />
The Alliance was a coalition, not an 'empire'. Varian becoming High King of the Alliance, akin to a a Warchief, commanding all? That is beyond ridiculous. Alliance faction leaders, and races, are much better than that. They want to make Alliance and the Horde like mirrors to each other. It is pitiful.<br />
<br />
Sadly, Warcraft's lore seems frozen in time. Up until WotLK, they still had some plot hooks they could use. After that, it seems like they went okay, now what?, and Metzen, Knaak, 'in-game' developers and such created this travesty that is the current lore. Such a pity. The RPG books turned out to be 'better canon' :(I disagree i think this favortism once in awhile makes lore and gameplay more interesting. The thrall we have now is the same we had in WC3 heck thrall allied with the alliance remember? Garrosh wants to crush his enemies, I like that :) I think most of the QQ'ing people about lore just want to do that QQ, and focus on not what truely is panning out for the future lore. Lets see how things pan out I think lore now is more interesting than it's ever been and who cares if blizz if favoring one side or another the thing for me is, if it's interesting or not.</div></div><hr />

Faction Favoritism has been an issue since BC, if not earlier, and it honestly seemed to me that since then the majority of the game was Horde-centric. Wrath is of course an exception, though I didn't see anything at all to make up for the Horde favoring in BC; The Alliance's key moment was when one of its greatest heroes died! Wow, that sure made me &quot;proud&quot; to be Alliance back then.<br />
Don't get me wrong though, Wrath was a very balanced expansion when it came to the story. But after so many years, isn't it time for the Alliance to finally get some love? All they have right now are &quot;key moments&quot;, whereas the Horde has not just one, but two key expansions!<br />
<br />
I'm just going to say that Mists of Pandaria should have been an Alliance-centric expansion, but from what we've seen so far it's unlikely that such a thing will happen.<br />
As such... I call BS on this entire wall of text. The Horde has been favored for a long time, and I am not convinced that this will cease to happen.</div></div><hr />

<br />
From the WoW Wiki:<br />
<br />
Tirion Fordring was one of the first five Knights of the Silver Hand selected by Archbishop Alonsus Faol, and was one of the heroes of the Second War. He later became Lord of Mardenholde Keep in Hearthglen before being stripped of his title and exiled for defending an orc, Eitrigg. Following the recent death of his son Taelan Fordring, Tirion committed himself to refounding the order of the Silver Hand. He now leads the Argent Crusade, an organization consisting of the old Knights of the Silver Hand and the Argent Dawn, against the Lich King and the Scourge. To this day he remains good friends with the orc veteran Eitrigg.<br />
<br />
He was about as neutral as humans get, but was not Alliance.</div></div><hr />

Who cares who lost which pieces of land? It's not supposed to be even; war has no such guarantee. The issue is that the Alliance gets so little character development. And that we have no war cry or battle shout. And that we're derided by even the devs for being loyal to the Alliance.<br />
<br />
And to the Horde's orcs I give you the Alliance's draenei. WAY more persecuted.<br />
<br />
As far as the Alliance battle shout... I kind of feel like Alliance, while working towards the same goal, Have very rich history's of their own, so while they may not have one omniscient &quot;cry&quot; per-say I feel like their own individual histories and cultures are too strong to pin them with one phrase covering all. Night Elves, Dwarves, Gnomes even, all have their own special way of charging into battle =P<br />
<br />
I see horde like more of a melting pot, more of a &quot;unified&quot; entity in battle at least. I know its cliche but think of Salron's army. They seemed like just one moving mass of evil. One goal, one idea. <br />
<br />
I feel neither is worse then the other, they just have very different feels to me. Rightly so.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Tirion is a Human, that much is true. But he left the Alliance long ago, when he became a member of the Argent Dawn and the founder of the Argent Crusade.<br />
The same goes for Darion Morgraine. He might be a Human, but he's with the Knights of the Ebon Blade - Another neutral faction merely affilated with both the Horde and Alliance. And let's not forget Rhonin, since Dalaran also seems to have become Neutral.<br />
<br />
The reason why all these characters are Human is merely because of the fact that we, too, are Humans. As such, we can better affiliate ourselves with them... At least, I think that's the reasoning Blizzard had.<br />

I Agree whole hearted. But as an ally we don't even get to be the underdog with some damn pride! :( We're like a helpless puppy beeing beaten slowly to death.

I'm getting kinda tired of this argument. Have you read Rise of the Horde? If you haven't read that book, you don't get to act like the draenei are prosecuted.<br />
<br />
The draenei are eredar. 2/3rds of the eredar leadership willingly joined Sargeras, forming the bulk of the Burning Legion. Velen got together with some buddies and fled, renaming themselves draenei.<br />
<br />
They have spent tens of thousands of years dragged the Burning Legion from world to world in a game of cat and mouse, resulting in the death, enslavement, and destruction of several races. This is mentioned outright in Rise of the Horde. Velen spends a lot of time justifying the cost of the draenei's survival.<br />
<br />
They're the reason that Kil'jaeden went to Outland. He was hunting Velen. He has a grudge against him and wants revenge. He's done this plenty of times in the past, as well. The draenei knew it was coming. Still, the draenei hid in their magical invisible cities and let it happen, didn't even try to foster a relationship with the then-peaceful orcs.<br />
<br />
So, Kil'jaeden showed up and manipulated the orcs, tricking them into believing the secretive draenei were plotting against them. How were the orcs to know any better? Kil'jaeden's the freaking Deceiver, that's what he does. After they wiped out a bunch of the draenei settlements and Velen escaped (leaving behind plenty draenei to die as a diversion, mind you), the Burning Legion left the orcs to suffer until Medivh gave them the chance to conquer Azeroth.<br />
<br />
<br />
Even more importantly, most of the orcs in the present-day Horde weren't responsible for that. Most were born between the Second and Third Wars, when the orcs were in internment camps or enslaved, like Thrall.<br />
<br />
Garrosh and the Mag'har had absolutely nothing to do with any of it. They were isolated in Nagrand. No demonic corruption, no Horde, no fighting draenei. Garrosh was just a sickly kid back then.<br />
<br />
Most of the orcs who participated in the first two wars are either dead, part of the Dark Horde based in Blackrock, or part of the Fel Horde in Outland. Drek'thar and Saurfang are two of the rare exceptions.</div></div><hr />

They exist solely for one reason: to brainwash the player base, to make they think blizzard does a wondrous job with WoW and that it couldn't be better. Blizzard is horde biased. Their treatment to faction leaders is crudely different. Justas an example: they have never explored Alliance leaders to their full potential (and the ones they had, they made them become neutral). In fact, they've never explored them at all. Take Velen or Tyrande for instance, what have they done in all these years? Nothing. Just sat still in their respective capital cities. And, if you stop to think about it, they're far more powerful and were far more important to WoW's lore than some of the Horde leaders. I've lost my faith in blizzard's writing department, as they prefer to summon another super villain for us to kill, than to explore the intricate relations between the important characters of the game and, thus, develop the lore in a non linear way (which is what happens today - bad guy appears, we kill him, another bad one appears, and so on).</div></div><hr />
