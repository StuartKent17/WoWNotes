Evidently, yes. We knew he would be augmenting the cloak. They've never said 'weapon'. They either said 'legendary item' or 'arm you with a legendary'. Yeah, kind of a cop out that's going to make a number of people unhappy.</div></div><hr />

60% armor is not the same as 15% damage reduction. I don't think they really changed their mind, but i'm courious what this is:<br />
Fortitude (New) Reduces all damage taken by 10%. Instant.</div></div><hr />

Honestly, as someone who only is able to run LFR, I see it kind of fitting that the first fairly widely accessible &quot;legendary&quot; will be a cloak as appropriate.</div></div><hr />

Seriously? If that's the first thing you see when you see the tier then you've got issues...<br />

The fact that it uses the same beach-towel-slung-over-the-back model that we've had since vanilla is lame. Legendaries should look awesome. People don't continue to farm Thunderfury because it's just another sword. A legendary cloak should have a unique and cool model. Isn't it about time that WOW made a cloak that has layers or folds or billows a bit? I'm not saying it should look it comes from some 1990's Spawn comic, but it should change the wearer's silhouette. Other players should know at a glance that you're wearing the legendary cloak in the same way that EVERY OTHER legendary stands out in a crowd.</div></div><hr />

Not sure if this string has come up before, but I thought the devs were trying to find a way around sending mail cross realm (heirlooms) by just making them permanently available via some unlock method on an account wide basis. I guess this could also just be a string that is a resolution to trying to send mail to another player within coalesced realms?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't like how they're making Gamon a hero and honorable. True, he did &quot;try&quot; to defend the city from new DKs but I always saw him as some bitter, silent tauren thug hanging out at the inn. If he isn't a stand-in, then I can see him officially joining the ranks of the Horde army after this event. The Horde's going to need a lot of new men to replace those lost in the bloodbath after this. He may even take Nazgrim's place as a familiar commander Horde players go on adventures with in future expansions.</div></div><hr />

The fun and interesting variety in trinkets comes from ones made for PvE. There never has and never would be the same love put into ones made for PvP by the development team, more like trinket after trinket just going to give the same temporary health increase and so on.<br />
<br />
Until now, while one trinket slot practically has to be the CC-breaking trinket, there has been choice left in the second slot, but this change would wipe out meaningful choice on both.</div></div><hr />

The amount of people changing to human will be huge for pvp, just because of how stupidly strong those trinkets are for PVP. First example is this 5.4 Raid - Normal - Siege of Orgrimmar - Boss X Loot X - Agi DPS Trinket (4) (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/102311-5-4-raid-normal-siege-of-orgrimmar-boss-x-loot-x) imagine a rogue with that, that proc is 2.5x stronger than the Valor Trinket, with a lot more mastery as well. Same with caster trinkets 5.4 Raid - Normal - Siege of Orgrimmar - Boss X Loot X - Int Hit Trinket (1) (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/102293-5-4-raid-normal-siege-of-orgrimmar-boss-x-loot-x) that's going to be absolutely crazy, even if they cut both of those procs in half and double the duration.</div></div><hr />

The fact that it uses the same beach-towel-slung-over-the-back model that we've had since vanilla is lame. Legendaries should look awesome. People don't continue to farm Thunderfury because it's just another sword. A legendary cloak should have a unique and cool model. Isn't it about time that WOW made a cloak that has layers or folds or billows a bit? I'm not saying it should look it comes from some 1990's Spawn comic, but it should change the wearer's silhouette. Other players should know at a glance that you're wearing the legendary cloak in the same way that EVERY OTHER legendary stands out in a crowd.<br />
<br />
It's a legendary cloak you can get from being AFK in LFR. Of course it's not going to look awesome. It's not a 'proper' legendary, since everyone will have it, making it more like a valor item you can only buy from a vendor after collecting 200 items etc.</div></div><hr />

From UnitFrame.lua :<br />
<br />
function GetUnitName(unit, showServerName)<br />
local name, server = UnitName(unit);<br />
local relationship = UnitRealmRelationship(unit);<br />
if ( server and server ~= &quot;&quot; ) then<br />
if ( showServerName ) then<br />
return name..&quot;-&quot;..server;<br />
else<br />
if (relationship == LE_REALM_RELATION_VIRTUAL) then<br />
return name..INTERACTIVE_SERVER_LABEL;<br />
else<br />
return name..FOREIGN_SERVER_LABEL;<br />
end<br />
end<br />
else<br />
return name;<br />
end<br />
end<br />
<br />
This code is for getting a Unit's name for putting on a tooltip (I guess)<br />
<br />
First it looks like it grabs the name , server &amp; relationship of the given unit.<br />
<br />
Then depending on the relationship it either returns :<br />
<br />
Name - Server (on same server)<br />
<br />
Name - Interactive Server Realm Label (which according to GlobalStrings.lua is a #)<br />
<br />
Name - Foreign Server Realm label (which according to GlobalStrings.lua is a *)<br />
<br />
So what does this mean ? We will have Virtual Realms as well as CRZ ?<br />
<br />
So CRZ isn't going away ?</div></div><hr />

Saurfang has more relevance to the Horde. Gamon however, is just a product of poor quest design and a joke among players. It would be like making Hogger a key character if the raid were placed in Stormwind.</div></div><hr />

He's an achievement objective for the Nazgrim fight. If he survives, he gets the killing blow and there's some different dialogue. If he dies, he dies. We dunno which one will end up being canon.</div></div><hr />

Ok, I have to call bullshit on the new mount letting herbalists pick herbs...Thanks for completely taking away the uniqueness of being a Druid. Again. Fuck you, Blizzard!<br />
<br />
Ok letzt change this - &quot;all classes getting an instant flight form except the druid&quot; - that also would make &quot;your&quot; class unique - right? Or are you just overreacting because other classes might get the same perk as you?</div></div><hr />

It looks like the helmet is locked between the ridiculous chest horns. It is haphazardly assembled and overly complicated. It appears that they are afraid to build a coherent theme because it makes it easy for people to focus their complaint. But what results is an unexciting collage of horns in new places rather than good places. Thank goodness for T-mog and the only people who are stuck with it are leet raiders who wish to show off their top-end gear.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard is loathe to remove something that was intentionally hidden from players until its introduction. Face it, we are stuck with the monstrosity for as long as this game lasts.<br />

<br />
<br />
Wow that str cloak will be BIS even at level 100 :D<br />
Two words, my friend: Gear reset. The only time this hasn't happened was in Wrath of the Lich King, when Blizzard responded to player complaints about their T3 stuff from old WoW being immediately replaced by Burning Crusade quest greens (see comic (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/media/comics/?keywords=&amp;view#/comic-2007-07-fantaray)). However, Blizzard apparently didn't like players being able to do Naxxramas in their T6 / Sunwell gear.<br />
<br />
So now we get inflated health/mana pools, stats... you name it. It wouldn't surprise me if tanks in the next expansion can easily reach 1 million hp, DPS dealing 300k, etc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because people don't like getting ganked or competing for resources. Therefore, anything that might make the world more populated is game breaking and a 'monstrosity'<br />
<br />
I typically don't have any aversions to the set artwork, but the Warrior 16 is way too busy and very sloppy looking. I was hoping for a set that'd prompt me to move on from my current transmog setup... this is certainly not it.<br />
<br />
Aside from the artwork, this patch is shaping up to be an impressive final (major) patch. Pending PvP announcement has me excited.</div></div><hr />

Two of one gender lets you see colour differences, one of the other gender lets you see the gender differences.<br />

Much better approach than three different human males - that approach didn't really tell me how the tier will look on my (predominantly female &amp; all non-human) toons.</div></div><hr />

This effect has a 60 sec cooldown.&quot; would be useable as dps. If yes, imagine whole raid using that exact legendary bonus = no random deaths during progress, hell you could even dodge an instakill ability like big bang at Algalon.<br />
You probably wouldn't even lose that much dps because using damage mitigating cooldowns usually uses a global cooldown which you could now use for dealing damage.</div></div><hr />
