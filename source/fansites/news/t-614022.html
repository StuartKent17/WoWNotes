Build 8905 - The Violet Hold (75-77)<br />
The Violet Hold is a new instance introduced in Build 8905, it's located in Dalaran and is very similar to The Black Morass in TBC. Players have to fight waves of trashes between bosses encounters with the objective to defend Dalaran from the blue Dragonflight. <br />
<br />
The Violet Hold is a level 75-77 instance in Dalaran. Talk to Rhonin in Dalaran to get the quest that grants you the key.<br />
<br />
This dungeon is in a very unpolished state. We're putting this on beta to begin the feedback process. If you lose the event, it is highly likely that the dungeon will not reset properly. Tuning of some encounters will be rough. Give it a try, it's in Dalaran and pretty quick. <br />

http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/24x24/paladin.jpg Upcoming Paladin Changes<br />
<br />
Here are some things we are looking at right now. You may not agree with them all, but I will share them with you in the hopes of making you feel better about your class, and maybe even getting you excited again. I also can't promise they are final because it's still the sort of thing we're wrestling with, and I don't want to disappoint anyone if it doesn't work out or we change our minds. Okay, massive caveats out of the way:<br />
<br />
We'd like to do something else with Kings. I don't know that a core ability is the answer, but burying it deep in Prot, when Prot warriors would just as soon play with BoSanc, doesn't feel great either.<br />
We'd like to mess around with the top 2 tiers of all 3 trees, still encouraging you to cross-spec a little, but making that initial bite into the upper tier more tasty instead of just an icky appetizer to get the what you really want down deeper.<br />
I think Beacon of Light is starting to feel pretty good. It may be a little OP right now, but I think we can get it in a good place. (I'm sorry, but I don't know if you have the version I'm talking about or not.)<br />
We'd like to get Vengeance back to 3 stacks, because that just feels more fun than 2. I can almost assure you that it won't be at 15% total damage -- that is hugely generous for 5 talent points, and would normally be budgeted at more like 15 talent points. If I had to guess, it will end up at something like 3 talent points for 1 / 2 / 3% that stacks up to 3 times (so 9% at 3 stacks). That is still over-inflated for 3 talent points. I understand that your dps used to depend on Vengeance. We'll just have to buff it in other ways. Death Knights will get the exact same treatment, whatever it ends up being.<br />
JotW was changed to support the new party buff system and it needs to keep that role. That is one of the main reasons why a group would want to take a Ret pally over another dps class. I understand your mana was dependent on this ability. We'll just have to buff that in other ways as well. Having too many talents that just lower mana costs feel like a band-aid, so we'd rather not overdo that route. Instead we'd just like to make sure you have enough mana. The new Divine Plea is one mechanic here (it works more like Blood Rage than Evocate now), but it's not the only one.<br />
Deep Ret and deep Prot need 1 or 2 more cool talents. We'll carve out room by bundling or just swapping out some of the current talents.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I hope you take this little view into our current thought process in the spirit that it's given. Sometimes we regret talking about stuff that isn't final because it ends up coming back to bite us. But I also thought it wouldn't hurt to cheer you up a little either, so hopefully something I've said will do that. <br />

Arena Tournament - North American Warcraft Finals Video<br />
eSportsTV (http://www.esportstv.com/newsite/?p=events&amp;id=1519) is bringing the action from the 2008 North American Warcraft Finals to you live from Boston.

Status of premades in Europe and non-US servers<br />
As we're moving ahead with the beta we feel specific testing on high-end PvP balance is required. Hence one (US) realm does have level 80 pre-mades available.<br />
<br />
Between internal test realms, (upcoming) PTRs and beta realms for all regions our testing hardware is already fully utilized, and as the main testing needs are still on the vast amount of other content, other realms are kept as is.<br />
<br />
While we appreciate everybody's eagerness to test high-end characters and PvP gear we hope you understand the need for having testing resources spread on all parts of the expansion. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/9679909751-so-us-got-premades-again-are-we-ever.html))<br />
<br />
Spirit for casters in WotLK<br />
As I posted in another thread, some amount of Spirit is something that all casters are going to need a lot more of. You can't stack shadow priests like you used to, and you can't downrank. Mana management is a part of all caster classes, not just trying to maximize the pewpew. We got away from that a little in BC.<br />
<br />
We also don't always design gear to be perfectly optimal for everyone. Part of the game is examining a piece of gear, deciding if you need it or not, and how it will really benefit you. If your set pieces are perfectly optimized, it makes it less interesting to look at any other drops until you're at the next tier. (Now I'm not saying we're going to give you Str and Parry either.)<br />
<br />
That said, I will bring up whether we could afford to trade a little spirit for crit on your gear. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/2/9679908318-tons-of-spirit-on-the-naxx-balance-gear.html))<br />
<br />
All casters are going to need to take mana regeneration seriously again. For too long we let casters just stack +damage stats and fill themselves back up with shadow priests. You also have to consider downranking is also gone now so you can't rely on that to save you mana. Spirit is a seriously good stat now. I realize Dreamstate isn't directly a Spirit buff, but neither does it let you opt out of stat-based mana regen. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/2/9679910008-to-devs-an-open-letter.html))<br />

Avoiding Daze as a bear tank<br />
I believe bears with the right talents can avoid daze now. We discussed an implementation for that. It may not be in the data you have at the moment. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/2/9679800490-feral-ghostcrawlers-challenge.html))<br />
<br />
Balance Druids<br />
I am focused on tanking an awful lot right now. It's just a part of the game we think needs some help. It's certainly not the only part that needs help, but it's what I'm doing and I tend to post a lot so you see a lot of discussion about tanking. I actually appreciate the Balance community a lot because somehow you guys manage to stay fairly positive even though you have not gotten the attention you deserve (either from blue posts now or all throughout BC). I started to go through your tree in more detail today so I understand why you think there are too many mandatory talents, and I promise to get back to that soon.<br />
<br />
What do we want balance to be able to do? What's your role? You're a caster. Surprise, I know. But we think we didn't always give you the tools to be a good caster before. You need:<br />
<br />
Competitive dps. Mages and warlocks just tend to get a lot of attention, maybe because there are more of them, or more races of them, or they are more archetypal classes (in the familiarity sense).<br />
Good AE utility. Encounters and dungeons tend to get designed with the assumption that the ranged dps can do AE. Hurricane is phenomenal now. I healed a run today and did really competitive dps with Hurricane on the ranged pulls. And I wasn't even Balance! I love Starfall. It's a rare spell because it feels new -- it isn't single target and it isn't classical Hurricane-style AE either.<br />
CC. If a group has a choice between a druid and a mage and only the mage can CC, the decision gets a lot easier. With Entangling Roots used inside, problem solved.<br />
Group utility. I think deep balance provides that now. Even Insect Swarm and Faerie Fire have a better role now. Without the vicious cycle of Curse of Shadows buffing warlocks which lead to inviting more warlocks somewhat solved, I think it will be easier for Balance druids to get into raids regardless. We've just opened space for more classes now.<br />
The ability to keep causing damage. I think the oomkin thing was largely addressed in BC, but it's still something we need to keep an eye on, or at least try and banish the stigma that other players still think it has.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
So that's it for role. Beyond that, what I think Balance needed was a means not to go insane by mashing the same buttons all the time. My favorite talent for attempting to solve this is Eclipse. Eclipse almost by itself &quot;saved&quot; Balance for me. Several times I tried going Balance in Classic and BC and just couldn't do it. But Eclipse is fun just because sometimes you want to Wrath and sometimes you want to Starfire. Improved Insect Swarm starts to get at this kind of mixed up of rotations too, and even the haste benefit from Moonkin a little as well.<br />
<br />
Those are my thoughts. I don't think Balance is done yet by any stretch, but I don't hesitate to go Balance in a dungeon or raid now, which actually says quite a lot. I think the designers have done a good job with the tree so far. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/2/9679751388-ferals-continued-favoritism.html))<br />
<br />
<br />
Feral / Balance Issues<br />
There are no tank niches, at least the way they have been defined here. When you ask why would anyone take a druid tank over a warrior tank, the answer is because that player is a better player, not because they have the magic ability that makes an encounter much easier. If you're concern is that the preponderance of warrior mitigation and abilities makes warriors a much more effective tank than druids, then that is a legitimate problem. <br />
We haven't finished tuning numbers yet. If cat dps is low, we'll fix it before Lich King goes live. We haven't focused on that yet because we are still working on talent trees and bugs. But you're starting to see some of it. One thing I forgot to mention is that the raid buff overhaul was a net dps loss to melee classes. We expected that would happen, but we have not yet adjusted their dps accordingly. That might not be all cats need, but I wanted to mention it before I forgot.<br />
I know balance druids feel neglected. My time is limited, and it's totally valid feedback that I don't give all specs or classes equal attention. My choices seem to be post a little or not post at all. I'm not a CM and any time I spend here (while very valuable for me) is time I'm not fixing classes. We'll try to give balance some more love. <br />
I think bears in particular could use a couple more situational abilities. We did lower the cooldown on Berserk and we might even do it again. I assume this doesn't count or you wouldn't be asking for more flashy abilities, but when I did Feral Charge as cat in Utgarde last night, the fight virtually stopped while everyone said &quot;Wait? What did you just do? That looked so cool!&quot; <br />
Feral is going to feel a little bigger than other trees because we are specifically trying to offer you more talents than you can get. The design is that you can choose 2-3 talents to emphasize your bear role over your cart role... if you choose. If you want to try and be relatively good at both, then split the difference between those talents. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Is there any chance to see Rebirth and Innervate given to other classes ?<br />
At the moment we have no plans to give those abilities to other classes. The raid buff stacking change was done because it was disheartening to see players spend so much effort trying to min / max the buffs different classes brought, and understandably so, rather than trying the encounters.<br />
<br />
We understand that the risk of having more redundant buffs across classes is homogenization and too much homogenization hurts class diversity. So long as we avoid any fights in which Innervate or brez offer a huge bonus, we don't see a reason to hand them out to everybody. That goes true for similar abilities that other classes have.

Metamorphosis Feedback<br />
This is kind of a specific request, but please give us any feedback you have on Metamorphosis, the 51 Demo talent. Assume that we aren't going to swap this talent out with something else, but other than that, nothing needs to be set in stone.

Death Knight DPS rotations and balancing<br />
We did consider purposely lowering DK white damage so that the specials could be bigger. But it actually does some wacky things to scaling when melee classes do a much larger proportion of yellow damage than white damage -- 40% white damage is about what we shoot for, though that isn't always realized.<br />
<br />
On-next swing attacks are very controversial. They make more sense for classes that need rage dump, but don't specifically help the DK. When we tried them for the DK, there were some people who liked the mechanic, but a lot who didn't.<br />
<br />
You can make a compelling argument that the vision of the DK as someone swinging a big two-hander like Frostmourne doesn't jive well with runes as a power cost, since the latter tend to push you towards using more abilities more often (which necessarily pushes the damage down to compensate).<br />
<br />
Changing that now though would be a huge setback, and I'm actually pretty happy with the DK rotations at the moment. We just need to get the damage somewhere that feels satisfying while still balanced with other classes. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/18/9679400367-yellow-vs-white-damage.html))<br />

I don't think Blizzard will do that as it hurts the variety (translated: cost of you respecing when you get a new weapon) of the tree... also, it'd probably mean that they'd have to do something similar to the Arms tree as it still has 3 weapon specializations (poleaxe, mace and sword)... which rogues are now equivalent to.<br />

I agree that it offers versatility, but I still don't see Blizzard going from 3 to 2 without doing the same to warriors. Also, you'd be increasing the worth of one talent without changing the amounts of points required. <br />
<br />
Shamans aren't even relevant to this as they have no talents that push them toward one type of weapon (note that this excludes 1H vs 2H). Certain races may push you toward one way or another depending on your racials, but unless Blizzard makes a change, +5 expertise isn't going to be very potent (even though right now it's only ~.30% at 70) when you hit 80 (as all rating-&gt;percent conversions are pretty much doubling).</div></div><hr />

<br />
I believe that change was necessary to reduce the need to lifetap so often (and thus reduce the lock's dps), since some of the lock's main dps talents in TBC were heavily nerfed in WotLK (0/21/40 shadow destro huh?). Yes I am aware that firedestro is currently doing more dps than probably intended, but demo and affliction needed this change aswell.<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh and since the healing component was switched to Demon armor, locks now get additional armor value on their pvp armor spell (which gets eaten by melee's armor penetration somewhat instantly) instead of spelldamage. The Fel Armor change definitely has its drawbacks for warlocks.<br />
<br />
On a general note, despite the recent blue post quoted in this thread about mana conserving, the general direction in TBC and WotLK seems to have been that no dps class will run totally out of mana on a succesful bosskill. No extensive mana conserving effort is required as any mana dependant dps class especially if you have a mana battery in your group. In 3.0+ everyone in the raid will have a mana battery.<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit to clarify: by 'extensive' I mean having for example well-timed breaks in dps to allow spirit regen (FSR+). I expect everyone, yes even warlocks, to use mana potions / mana gems / whatever mana regen skills/consumables are available to their class by default.</div></div><hr />

What is it with these blizzard devs? Do we need to spell it out for them? Here's an idea that even a monkey can understand: TAKE KINGS OUT OF TALENT AND MAKE IT TRAINABLE.<br />
<br />
Also on a side note: WTF is this nerf to vengenace? 9% wtf. I can understand the reason for it as its 5 talent points - 3% per talent point. So in this case its nine. But, the first time you nerffed it it was 5 points and the dmg was dropped to 10%. Only to be changed back to 15%. Keep it 15%. Want it 3 points fine, do it this way - 5%,10%,15%. There 3 points for 15%. At this rate we'll do less dmg then when the first nerf to vengence would of happened.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Wow, they gave the explanation for the change in pretty significant detail--essentially balancing its power for the talent point investment required. And they acknowledged that the difference dps it brought then vs. now will be replaced by something else. That's not hate, its called game balancing... qq more.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zimbambadu</div><div class="date">2008-09-09, 04:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree that it offers versatility, but I still don't see Blizzard going from 3 to 2 without doing the same to warriors. Also, you'd be increasing the worth of one talent without changing the amounts of points required. <br />
<br />
Shamans aren't even relevant to this as they have no talents that push them toward one type of weapon (note that this excludes 1H vs 2H). Certain races may push you toward one way or another depending on your racials, but unless Blizzard makes a change, +5 expertise isn't going to be very potent (even though right now it's only ~.30% at 70) when you hit 80 (as all rating-&gt;percent conversions are pretty much doubling).<br />
<br />
<br />
+5 Expertise is NOT +5 expertise rating, therefore, +5 expertise will be the same value at 70 as it is at 80. Which in terms of stat points makes it more valuable.</div></div><hr />

Apparently no one really follows the update pattern or what Blizzard themselves have said. Updates for classes happen in cycles, much like the original class reviews in the pre-BC days. They are looking at a small amount of classes, comparing them to others, and then trying to change them appropriately. If they feel at a later time that one of these classes is still lacking, they will make more changes.<br />
<br />
Mages got A LOT of changes early on, they were one of the first major updates I remember reading about (but maybe thats bc I play mage). But anyway, I still see regular tweaking of the mage class, and we even just got a huge new spell (if it works right). Give them time, they can't publish changes for 10 classes every patch, or balance would be near impossible to reach.<br />

u mean... one slight change to one talent and one replaced by another one, which is as crappy now as the last one? YEA, thats what we fear off, that THAT was our &quot;polish&quot; and we wont see anything else. and btw all we got at this was getting 40dmg+ on flametongue and moved LB coef part to another one and slightly buffed, gimme a weed, thanks :)<br />

They also said we'd get new starfall ranks over a month before they actually added it (they're not even working properly though), they promised to reduce bloat weeks ago without any news. They promised to fix typhoon weeks ago, still nothing. They said eclipse wasn't quite were it should be, now it seems GC is happy with it (nothing has changed, it's still worthless). They also said they'd make E&amp;M valuable for more than 2-3 points, still didn't happen.<br />
<br />
Yes they have said a lot things, we've seen nothing. Compared to other classes which have seen massive CHANGES, this is just sad. No a promise they might fix something isn't a change, Kalgan himself said we'd get a dire cat form which later just proved wrong.<br />
<br />
Balance druids have been treated like this last expansion too and we aren't as viable as other classes, we need work and Blizzard doesn't seem willing to do it.<br />
(Kalgan and GC have said they dislike balance druids in official posts, just proves how in touch they are with their own inventions.)<br />
<br />
Yes we've been given utility, same for every other class. The amount of buffs barely matter since there will be a lot of overlap anyway. None of our utility is unique or better than the counterparts, while for example ele shamans bring the only spell haste buff and the best spell damage one. Also utility is worthless if our dps will be too low to actually warrant a raiding spot, which with our crappy itemized gear seems quite likely.<br />
And we don't have a talent to improve spell damage or mana regen, which are pretty much the most important. Just mentioning for your statement.<br />

<br />
If you think something needs changing, post constructive feedback rather than insisting that Blizzard hates you. There is still a lot of time to make changes before and even after the WOTLK release. It's also a good idea to keep in mind that true balance can never be achieved with 10 classes that all have many different abilities and talents.<br />

<br />
Im sry, what? Balance &quot;druids&quot;, bottom of the food chain? I laugh at that comment. At least as a balance druid you can heal and dps at the same dam time. And you whin at your talent tree, pfft. Im a holy pally and I can tell you this: Lets for one entire month switch talent trees then see how much you have it made. Try working with &quot;ONLY&quot; one spell class thoughout this game then tell me how it feels once your locked from it. Try having every single healing spell cost godly amounts of mana and heal for little.<br />
<br />
Don't come on here and say crap like this. Pallys have been lied to, nerf to hell, nevered given the respect they deserve in this game since reckoning bomb was our aka. Where a joke in ALL areas in this game. Everyone can aoe heal, everyone gets a new healing spell (in the last 3 yrs), Everyone brings something to the dam table. We never once recieved a new healing spell in 3 yrs. Where still the single target gods that we are, but this game has moved on from single trageting. <br />
<br />
Into these buffs that ret is getting, EVERYONE only knew ret as one thing: LOLRET.<br />
<br />
Prot was always good but there was little to no items for a prot pally.<br />
<br />
Holy &quot;was&quot; the best single healer in this game, now there also a joke. Now instead of LOLRET it's LOLHOLY. The &quot;Only&quot; where viable in is 5s which is sad. These days ppl complain about anything. I still remeber S1. Thats when holy pallies had there shine. But the cries came and right after S1, the nerf train came by and beat the living heal out of us. <br />
<br />
Where do you see pallies in arena now? Forget single target healing, Shamans have taken that place now. The pally have been disrepected for far to long. While everyone else get buffs, we only dream of them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've been running level 80 instances as PvE Mutilate and it really does feel 100% polished. You can get everything you need in Assassination for a perfect Mutilate, Envenom &amp; Hunger for Blood cycle. You can pick up the 3 vital combat talents without wasting fillers. (Precision, Dual-Wield Spec, &quot;Close Quarters Spec&quot; aka Dagger Spec) and you can grab Opportunity/Relentless in Sub, also. <br />
<br />
With Instant Poison critting regularly for 2K, and landing on every swing (now you can achieve &quot;hit cap&quot; and &quot;poison cap&quot;); it's very easy to maintain 5 stacks of Deadly Poison via Deadly Brew. You can't actually generate combo points fast enough to use up the Deadly Poison charges. You'll always have a 5 stack before you can Envenom again. Which means SnD is constantly refreshing itself. The whole style finally feels, well, final.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't be too concerned about not seeing many more Rogue updates. Combat is reasonably polished and Subtlety has been paid quite a bit of attention lately. I'd expect a few phases of modifier/PvP tuning and Rogues will be ready for the shelf.</div></div><hr />

They have a spamable nuke, they have the ability to heal themselves in wotlk with their +spelldmg turning directly into highly scaling +healing with HOTS. They have the ability to run away from anything that isn't a paladin They have solid CC with cyclone and roots. They have a heavy nuke that can stun if left alone in arena style pvp. <br />

<br />
<br />
Not really. My main was a balance druid for a long time. (Well resto first, went balance around 2.3). I still destroyed everyone except shadowbolt warlocks in Hyjal/BT most fights.<br />
<br />
+13% spell damage is a lot more important than +flat, non-scaling spell damage. And who cares if you don't have mana regen, it's 1) nerfed, and 2) only available to 3 out of 30 specs in the game, widely considered the lowest 3 DPS specs in the game too.<br />
<br />
And no, every class hasn't been given utility. Warlocks gained no new utility from BC, and because of the stacking buff changes, has gone down. A lot. Can't even use more than 1 healthstone anymore.<br />
<br />
Also, not every dev has to like playing every spec. Doesn't mean they won't be fair. Balance got a LOT, and I mean a LOT of wished for changes with Wrath, and you're already complaining about stuff you haven't even seen on a PTR yet? Trust me, you'll be viable. Let me name just a few big ones.<br />
1) Indoor roots. This becomes the 2nd best CC in the game for melee enemies. You can use it on anything, recast it before it ends, and the range/duration is great. (Compare to fear, seduce, freezing traps, sap, blind in those areas. And better than shackle/poly in terms of stuff you can cast it on.)<br />
2) AOE that's not on a cooldown. Couple your THREE aoe spells with your absurd armor, and moonkin could very well become one of the AOE classes of choice.<br />
3) Omen of Clarity applying to spells, a Moonkin Aura that regenerates mana based on spells, and more spirit on gear. Your mana regen has never been better<br />
4) Shittons more arcane damage buffs debuffs. Both personal and from the raid.<br />
5) AFAIK Nature's Grace will work with the GCD now, but I'm not sure about that.<br />
6) Reshuffled low tier Resto, allowing for a LOT more benefit for those points.<br />
7) Imp. FF gives spell hit<br />
<br />
Seriously, there's almost nothing that I had a problem with that wasn't changed for Wrath. The above problems were the only reasons I dropped my druid for a warlock. Almost wish I had stayed with him. (Almost.)<br />
<br />
Something like this will be a great spec, imo:<br />
http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?druid=00000000000000000000000000000025003312000000000000000005032201025331205213305010231<br />
<br />
It has strong AOE too.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Panoramixe</div><div class="date">2008-09-10, 09:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Seeing as you are a bit clueless on a few points I'll just sum up the mistakes.<br />
1) Arcane dmg buffs? Are you bloody serious? Go read that huge post that was on the main page explaining how raid buffs changed and don't stack anymore, you'll notice there aren't any school specific buffs left except for shaman's stormstrike.<br />
<br />
2) Good we got viable cc, took them long enough. It will help a lot finding a group in 5-mans, but it won't help in pvp nor raids. I love this change, but this isn't anywhere near overpowered or a reason to bring a moonkin to a raid.<br />
<br />
3) AOE: fine we're a lot better at this than in TBC, too bad mages and locks are still far better. In the end aoe is inferior to single target damage, which close to every boss needs, while aoe is situational.<br />
<br />
4) Imp FF gives spell hit, good it actually helps us. Now go look at this talent called misery in the priest's shadowtree. They get extra bonusses in the talent and get to keep the buff up through normal damage, so misery &gt; imp ff.<br />
<br />
5) The lower resto tiers: We gain 4% spell damage, 10% int and OOC there.<br />
Too bad our int based talents got nerfed to near uselessnes. Lunar guidance got halved to 12% of int to spell damage and dreamstate will get skipped for intensity thanks to our massive amounts of spirit on gear. So the furor change is hardly noticeable. OOC is less good than a point in intensity, but it's nice. And master shapeshifter probably brings us on the same level more or less if Lunar Guidance wasn't nerfed.<br />
<br />
Locks have gotten some more raid utility from pets, not the best perhaps but they did get some.<br />
<br />
Just remember every class gets stronger, fixes aren't enough.<br />
<br />
ps. There is a full 25 page thread about moonkin issues on the eu forums and the new one is on page 16 now, a lot of people are concerned with reason. Most of the posters have tested end-game raiding (sunwell) and know bloody well moonkin have far more issues than that are so far fixed.</div></div><hr />

This is exactly what we DON'T want. Intellect hogging up our item level is not what you want..trust me. Blessing of sanc, the new Divine Plea, and spiritual attunement will be plenty of mana. And since we will only have about 5k mana anyway, our mana breaks with Lvl 80 water will only be about 5 or 6 seconds anyway(if we even have to stop and drink).</div></div><hr />

Question: What makes a paladian gear different from a warrior gear?<br />
Answer: Int<br />
<br />
Without int we will just be wearing warrior gear. Int is what sets us apart from warriors. Well, that and spell power :P<br />
<br />
Int has NEVER been the problem for prot pallies, never. <br />
<br />
Everything about the prot pally would then have to be changed. Base mana to spells will have to be lower. I forgot how much max rank holy shield is, but I think its around 300-400 mana cost. That may not seem alot but to a 5k mana user it is. Add that with consercate, SoR/JoR and you wasted roughly 2k of it just for the aggro itself.</div></div><hr />

Agree 100%. If they start gimping the other stats to add int, I would rather just pick up the warrior gear isntead. Learning to control mana usage is better than gimping our gear by adding int and lowering stam/str.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">stupid11</div><div class="date">2008-09-10, 09:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Seeing as you are a bit clueless on a few points I'll just sum up the mistakes.<br />
1) Arcane dmg buffs? Are you bloody serious? Go read that huge post that was on the main page explaining how raid buffs changed and don't stack anymore, you'll notice there aren't any school specific buffs left except for shaman's stormstrike.<br />
<br />
2) Good we got viable cc, took them long enough. It will help a lot finding a group in 5-mans, but it won't help in pvp nor raids. I love this change, but this isn't anywhere near overpowered or a reason to bring a moonkin to a raid.<br />
<br />
3) AOE: fine we're a lot better at this than in TBC, too bad mages and locks are still far better. In the end aoe is inferior to single target damage, which close to every boss needs, while aoe is situational.<br />
<br />
4) Imp FF gives spell hit, good it actually helps us. Now go look at this talent called misery in the priest's shadowtree. They get extra bonusses in the talent and get to keep the buff up through normal damage, so misery &gt; imp ff.<br />
<br />
5) The lower resto tiers: We gain 4% spell damage, 10% int and OOC there.<br />
Too bad our int based talents got nerfed to near uselessnes. Lunar guidance got halved to 12% of int to spell damage and dreamstate will get skipped for intensity thanks to our massive amounts of spirit on gear. So the furor change is hardly noticeable. OOC is less good than a point in intensity, but it's nice. And master shapeshifter probably brings us on the same level more or less if Lunar Guidance wasn't nerfed.<br />
<br />
Locks have gotten some more raid utility from pets, not the best perhaps but they did get some.<br />
<br />
Just remember every class gets stronger, fixes aren't enough.<br />
<br />
ps. There is a full 25 page thread about moonkin issues on the eu forums and the new one is on page 16 now, a lot of people are concerned with reason. Most of the posters have tested end-game raiding (sunwell) and know bloody well moonkin have far more issues than that are so far fixed.<br />
<br />
<br />
1) Winter's Chill, Imp. Scorch. Those have never applied to arcane damage in the past. It's exactly the point that there aren't any school specific buffs left. That's a buff, because moonkins gained all the buffs that didn't apply to arcane before.<br />
<br />
2) Trash still needs to be CC'ed on occasion, even in 25 mans. You sure as hell probably won't be able to fear or seduce many mobs due to space and reapplication problems, so you sheep them. Don't have enough mages? Use a moonkin.<br />
<br />
3) Oh? And what makes you think they're &quot;far better?&quot; It's not like any AOE except fire mage AOE and moonkin AOE got buffed in Wrath. AOE is a large part of many raids, and not just boss fights. For instance Kael, a very important fight to have good AOE on for a very long time in TBC. Not having AOE for more than 10 seconds out of 60 in TBC sucked ASS for moonkins.<br />
<br />
4) Ok so? Now apply the same reasoning to E&amp;M, and you become the primary +% magic damage debuff applier. You even get the talented version, 13%, for free. And what if you aren't DPSing the same target as the shadowpriest? Or what if you don't bring a shadowpriest (certainly possible in a 10 man, especially with Ret Pallies and Surv Hunters in the mix)? Bottom line is it gives you 3% spell hit, it used to give nothing.<br />
<br />
5) Please. In TBC about 500 int was fairly average. Taking a look at Naxx10 gear, not to mention new buff ranks, you should be pushing 800 int before Furor easily. That's almost 100 damage. Not great, or maybe not even good, but not NOTHING. And Blizzard hasn't done their numbers pass. You never know, maybe it will get buffed back to 18 or 21%. And 4% damage and OOC is a lot better than the fat NOTHING it was before.<br />
<br />
(Edit: Bit more about int. Consider the spell crit increase it will give, and the straight mana since you're so concerned about that. Int also lowers your Spirit to mana regen coefficient, so you will gain more from Intensity because of Furor.)<br />
<br />
Imp. Moonkin aura more than makes up for the other changes. And Omen is 2 spells a minute for one point, if you're using Moonfire and Starfire at 70, that's ~600-800 mana, about 50 mp5 for 1 point. (Which was what we were getting from Dreamstate in BC.)<br />
<br />
You can even pick up Imp. MotW now. And seeing as the new rank of MotW is 37 all stats (not the shitty ass 14 it was TBC), that's ~52 all stats, a decent increase for the first 2 points in a tree.<br />
<br />
So stop QQing, Moonkins are fine.<br />
<br />
<br />
-------<br />
<br />
And no, locks didn't really gain all that much in terms of pet buffs. Imp's used to give stamina, now it gives HP and doesn't stack with commanding. And if you consider most locks will be Destro and using an Imp in Wrath, that means we lost utility. Sure, Aff locks get something, but it's worse than Arcane Int and Divine Spirit, and doesn't stack (it's one of the few buffs that Blizz has confirmed isn't intended to be as good as other buffs that it doesn't stack with). Demo got a nice buff, but that's Demo only.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
i wouldnt expect anything in that regard, since they nerfed shaman thunderstorm already<br />
<br />
<br />
No they didn't, they only nerfed the vertical distance. The horizontal distance will still be 20 yards.</div></div><hr />
