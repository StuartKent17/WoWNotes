The Story <br />
Some of the underdogs at the Spring Finals are finding form at just the right time. With the Sneakier Snakes taking North America Cup #3 to sneak into the Spring Finals they will be looking to catch fire at just the right time. Running one of the most dangerous Jungle Cleaves in the world, the pressure from Sneakier Snakes has looked better and better each week. The European region has its own underdog too with Ascendant coming in as a #3 seed. Don’t be fooled by that seeding for Ascendant though; in EU Cup #3 Ascendant lost to two of the top teams in the world: Skill Capped Black and XRB; the top two seeds in Europe.<br />
<br />
With a lethal RMP, Ascendant will be looking to match up with North America’s more direct compositions, especially if they can push the games later and get further into dampening. Sneakier Snakes should be showing a different angle, with their aggressive Jungle Cleave looking to push early and notch quick wins. The stylistic matchups will be in the spotlight on the big stage at the Spring Finals with the top North American teams, including Method Orange, playing a very aggressive fast style. On the other side, Europe has the behemoth Skill Capped Black playing an extremely smooth RMP right now with some very quick set ups. If both Sneakier Snakes and Ascendant can keep their red-hot play going into the Spring Finals anything is possible for them, even with tough matchups in round 1.<br />

The World of Warcraft Arena World Championship Spring Finals kick off March 31st featuring the best from North America and Europe. *<br />

<br />
You're right, it's terrible. Since this is the final version prior to release you should un-sub right away. No sense in sticking around playing a bland and generic game.</div></div><hr />

Exactly. A valley should be easy to traverse.</div></div><hr />

I wanted to see an old god infested zone full of bugs and terrifying creatures, guts and body parts everywhere. But I guess this game won't be this dark anymore... they want to sell it to kids like the fortnite cancer.</div></div><hr />

That's exactly what I was thinking. I do like it though. I hope we get a zone kind of like Netherstorm.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Correct me if I'm wrong, but eligibility for the alpha is based on a simple yes/no that people may have turned on or off years ago, right? That can't be the best way to do it. It should be people who register their interest in some way NOW.</div></div><hr />

Yep. It's random. That's all.</div></div><hr />
