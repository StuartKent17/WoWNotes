<br />
but this is awesome, i guess.. hopefully we can test 4.0.3a as well (we have no idea how the transition between the patches will go especially after the recent 4.0.1 [and with some of cata stuff like 80-85, worgen/goblin etc still switched off]).<br />
<br />
better to put it on the PTR even for a couple of weeks as we go through the prelude events on live.</div></div><hr />

The only thing that is really different is the &quot;Custom Latency&quot; Slider is now under combat in interface options.<br />
<br />
I checked for it as soon as it went online last night; then I posted in my predicted topic =P. Turns out I predicted 4.0.3 3 days before it happened.<br />

<br />
that's what i'm thinking, they did say 4.0.3a would be soon after, and as much as blizzard loves using the word &quot;soon&quot;, it was implied in context that it would occur within a few days (i'm guessing now after patch 4.0.3)<br />
<br />
and they did say the final event before the world sunders would blow our minds (probably in a better way than Halo 2's ninjas chasing helicopters and the ninjas are on fire hype)</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is how I understood it. <br />
<br />
The world will still be intact. But it will initiate the series of events like the Elemental Invasion and Twilight Cult stuff.<br />
<br />
Some time will pass, then 4.0.3a will be &quot;The Sundering&quot; when those events stop, and the Deathwing event begins.<br />
<br />
Some time will pass, then expansion hits (which will likely be the exact same version, but with a slightly higher build number)<br />
<br />
<br />
any way i can access PTR with beta client ? 13221 <br />
<br />
No.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That just because no one has downed LK on the test server. I imagine this 4.0.3 is to test if anything goes horribly wrong with the shattering happens. If they have anything big and excited up their sleeves for some major pre-shattering event, I doubt they will be testing it on the PTR. Zombie event wouldnt have been nearly as fun if they had tested that :p</div></div><hr />

This has already been explained to bite-sized bits. I'm simpily amazed that there are people who still cannot chew and swallow the information.<br />
You will not be able to play a Goblin or Worgen in the PTR. Goblins and Worgen are in the Cataclysm Beta only, and will remain there until Cataclysm hits live. Sorry guys, that's the way it is.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Tbhonest, I was of the opinion that the world changes should either happen the day cataclysm releases, if you're going to release them earlier you might as well do them now tbh..unless there is still unfinished stuff.. so ppl can level new class combos and focus on 80-85 with cataclysm launch</div></div><hr />

4.0.3 contains all the assets (and hopefully, most recent beta spell changes) required for the shattering to actually take place, probably a third phase of the world event as well.<br />

Ok, how about from the horse's mouth then<br />

Shortly before Cataclysm launches, Azeroth as you know it will be changed forever. Patch 4.0.3 will bring with it cataclysmic changes to the Eastern Kingdoms and Kalimdor. Players will be able to find new and exciting sights to see and quests to do in the level 1-60 zones, all-new troll and gnome introductory experiences, redesigned capital cities, new race/class combinations, and more!</div></div><hr />

Patch 4.0.3 will implement virtually all of the content necessary to make the changes to Azeroth, but those changes will actually take place in patch 4.0.3a, which is scheduled to be released shortly after patch 4.0.3.<br />
<br />
<br />
Patience, jedi. I could be way off the mark here but the way I see it, 4.0.3 has all the content, 4.0.3a switches it on.. and 4.0.3a will be a tiny patch that just flips it all live.</div></div><hr />

its not a fucking bug fix patch, its a content patch.</div></div><hr />

and i bet your arses that there will be more bugs that get IGNORED that are found by players in that patch also, just like 4.0.1</div></div><hr />

But if you think 4.0.1 with its HUGE patch size was required for a few new interface panels and some talent changes then you have some problems</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frankieo</div><div class="date">2010-10-29, 10:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Right, so I've just come off from trying out PTR Patch 4.0.3.<br />
I can say by the looks of it that there is a high percentage of people trying to log in and play, which is causing tremendous amounts of lag, and some dc issues for some people.<br />
<br />
However, when i logged on my Pre-Made Death Knight character, i found my inventory filled with lots of the old emblem of triumph tanking gear, almost a complete set in fact, a 3/5 set dps gear, and nothing else for dps usage except for pvp.<br />
<br />
So here is something that obviously has to be changed in order to make our testing actually look like 4.0.3 and not something before 4.0.1.<br />
<br />
Also, it shows i have enchanting and jewelcrafting, though when i go into my profession UI, it wont allow me to open up my enchanting/jewelcrafting book to do anything with the professions.<br />
I also only got 15 talent points to use at level 80, which is extremely annoying as well. <br />
And from what I've seen, it looks like the stat changes that got live in patch 4.0.1 has been wiped out with the older stat setup.<br />
<br />
Something that really shocked me though, was when i looked at the head piece of both tank gear and dps gear, and saw that my dps head piece had something with 190stam while, while the tank head piece had only 150stam. This can not be right, can it? xD</div></div><hr />

&quot;The test realms are currently loaded with 4.0.3 data. Most of the content that will be implemented with this patch will not be activated upon its release. That will come shortly after with patch 4.0.3a, which we are likely to deploy at some point during the 4.0.3 PTR phase.&quot;<br />

looks like we will get 4.0.3a on the ptr then :P</div></div><hr />

Just in case you haven't noticed after over 10 people have answered this question, you will not be able to try out the new race/class combinations untill either 1. You get an Cataclysm Beta Invitation. or 2. You wait for Cataclysm to come live 07.12.10 (EU).</div></div><hr />

Actually, that is untrue. Blizz has stated that the new race/class combo's would be added at the same time as the old world changes. We now know that to be patch 4.0.3a. This patch will contain everything in Cata except the stuff you will need to purchase Cata to gain access to, i.e. all the lvl 80-85 content and zones, archeology, and being able to create a Worgen or Goblin character.</div></div><hr />

I admit, it seems that i have been incorrect about that.<br />

<br />
Every patch should have bug fixes regardless of content. Also this has no new content. We already downloaded everything for Cata. The only difference is that 4.0.3a is when they will turn it on. 4.0.3 literally has nothing minus some vendors missing so it's pointless to get on until they unlock content that wasn't already tested on the PTR last patch.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This can also be for a test for the .3 to .3a conversion, since in the past the &quot;a&quot; designation has been minor (but critical) bug fixes, with extremely small downloads and rolling restarts. For example, the current 4.0.1a patch is what fixed the nameplate and cogwheel disconnect issue.</div></div><hr />
