New items using old models (Arena weapons, or just loot from future dungeons/encounters) <br />
Weapons used by NPCs and recolored to fit their style. <br />
Nothing, 90% of the recolors are here &quot;just in case&quot;, you'll never see them in game but they still look nice. <br />

Darkmoon faire hotfix<br />
There was a &quot;bug&quot; with the Darkmoon Faire this month and it spawned one week early. According to the calendar on the official site, it should have been this week but it seems that <br />
I apologize greatly for the miscommunication between my team and the web team who maintains the event calendar. The March Darkmoon Faire was listed a week later than it actually occurred.<br />
However, after a very long talk (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=5103878682&amp;postId=52356034524&amp;sid=1#0) on the official forums, Blizzard decided to hotfix it and the Darkmoon faire will be active for one more week, starting after the next maintenance.<br />
A hotfix has been applied that will start Darkmoon Faire after the next realm restart or maintenance, which are currently scheduled to conclude at 11:00 AM PDT, March 11.<br />
<br />
This will resolve the issue with the Faire running one week earlier than expected and will match the dates of the Faire to those listed on the event calender.<br />
<br />
<br />
Uldum<br />
It's been a while since the last time we heard anything about Uldum, but Drysc decided to post a little something about it. <br />
No, it's definitely a dungeon we're keen on opening at some point. Whether that can actually happen or not, or when, hasn't had any final decisions announced. It's a location rich in Titan lore so it's of course something everyone is excited to see come to fruition.<br />
<br />
I find the door still interesting as something has obviously broken out. Was there something meant to be contained within Uldum, to be forgotten, that's escaped? Possibly something we don't even associate with the Titans or their creations. Maybe something we take for granted, I don't know, but I like that idea.<br />
<br />
<br />
Arena season 4 reminder<br />
A small post to explain once again how sets are going to change with the season 4, Drysc also confirms that the Season 4 won't start anytime soon.<br />
We've only stated that Season 2 is moving to honor, Season 1 is being removed, and Season 3 prices will be lowered. Whether Season 4 or Season 2 prices will change from the Season 1 and Season 3 sets they're replacing has not yet been stated.<br />
<br />
One thing that's more certain is that Season 4 isn't going to start for quite a while.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sunwell Plateau still closed on PTRs<br />
The Sunwell Plateau needs more fixing and is still closed for public testing.<br />
The Sunwell Raid instance on the PTR is still closed for public testing at this time. Check back here for updates on future testing opportunities during this week.<br />
<br />
<br />
No more changes to socket bonuses in the future<br />
I didn't say we can't change socket bonuses, clearly we have in the past, and when we did it caused problems that required hotfixes. These problems may not have affected you personally but they did affect many players. We will not be making changes to socket bonuses in the future to avoid these problems. That is the end of discussion on this topic.<br />
<br />
<br />
Tabards/Robes bugs<br />
Sometimes wearing a tabard over a robe will only show the top half of the tabard, it's a known issue but sadly it can't really be fixed and you'll have to live with it.<br />
t's been a while since this was asked of the designers/artists but if I remember correctly the reasoning given at the time was that it was not a bug or oversight, but a decision based on technical limitations. The way our armor and animation systems work, of which I will not pretend I have any knowledge of, would make it extremely difficult and labor intensive to have the tabards show properly over the robes and actually look right/good. Something like having to change the entire system as well as remodel every piece or robe armor or some-such, I can't recall the details. So anyway, the decision was made to just hide the bottom portion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
http://i206.photobucket.com/albums/bb281/blankinthefill/gemcosts.jpg<br />
<br />
(notice I'm revered, so at exalted they'll be 40g each)<br />
<br />
Considering there are 38 patterns, thats quite a hit.<br />
<br />
Factoring in rep. discounts, the total cost (if buying the patterns as soon as their available) is now:<br />
<br />
Friendly: 617g 50s (13 patterns x 47.5g each)<br />
Honored: 405g (9 patterns x 45g each)<br />
Revered: 340g (8 patterns x 42.5g each)<br />
Exalted: 320g (8 patterns x 40g each)<br />
<br />
for a total of 1682g and 50s for the old Scale of the Sands/Hyjal dropped recipes.<br />
<br />
The four new epic cuts also cost 50g each, and are available at revered with SSO, decreasing their cost to 42.50. The new Regal Nightseye cut, available at revered, costs 10g 20s, and the 2 new meta cuts cost 12g 75s (also at revered) for a total of 205g, 70s.<br />
<br />
This brings the total cost of all JC cuts available from SSO to 1888g and 20s. <br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT: The Alchemist stone patterns prices have also been increased, to 21g 25s at Revered, or 20g at exalted when they are available.</div></div><hr />

Well, 50g per pattern for epic gems cut, this is much better than the 200-500g per pattern for blue gems u can find in Auction House (and some are the only place where you can get those since they are world drop).</div></div><hr />

As a Game Developer/Artist (no, I don't work for Blizz) I can tell you... this is NOT an issue of Blizzard being lazy.

I'm going to 2nd this statement. <br />
<br />
It’s not worth throwing resources and labor on an aspect of the game that’s not going to make an impact on the popularity or sales of the game. As a developer for the Wii and DS the truth is games are made to make profit. If it’s not worth it we don't bother and only exception is to get publishers attention. Of course theres things we'ed like to do but theres only so much time and so much to do.<br />
<br />
In a perfect world they would be remodeled.<br />
<br />

<br />
I can't speek for blizzard but having experience on consoles something that sounds simple doesn't mean it’s simple to accomplish in the games industry. I'll go out on a limb and suspect it has something to do with their Z depth and other assets like armor that have to be remodeled.</div></div><hr />

Does the WoW engine not support compositing two textures? Why don't they just draw the texture of the robe on the robe model and then just draw the rest of the tabard texture on top of that. There would be no modeling requirements just a change to the way the texture is calculated for the robe model.<br />
<br />
Maybe I'm looking at this too simplistically, but it seems like everything everyone (including Blizzard) is saying about how it would require re-modeling and all that re-working wouldn't seem to apply if they just made some texture changes.<br />
<br />
I don't personally care if the tabard lower portion &quot;flaps&quot; around above the robe while i'm walking like it does over pants models. We could just say that there's a lot of static in the Warcraft universe :).</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
The problem is the existing models do not have texture position information for where on the models the extra texture has to go. So they would have to go back through each model and add an extra set of texture co-ordinates to each vertex, this would probably require a change to the model file format as well as needing to have an artist go through each model and correctly set the new coordinate information for the tabard texture. <br />
<br />
This also assumes that the vertex information is already correctly placed such that there are vertices at which the edges of the tabard texture will be placed, if not they would need to further tesselate each of the robe models to add this information at which point you need to remodel each animation frame rather than make a single texture positioning change which applies to all animation frames. <br />
<br />
Then you need to structure your model that you know to only draw the extra texture on the part of the model where the tabard goes, since the tabards themselves don't have any redundant space where transparent pixels can be stored for blending in the unused parts of the model you either need to redo the existing tabard system or add further changes to the way you render those models.<br />
<br />
It is certainly doable, and technically not even all that hard, but it would require a non trivial amount of work and you would have to go back over the models. It isn't just a case of saying &quot;composite these two textures&quot; you have to say where on the models the extra texture goes and that is the part that requires the further work.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, thanks for elaborating. I guess I was thinking that since the robe model is pretty much just n*2 where n = number of races and 2 = number of genders, so, they could maybe do it in post-processing mathematically with conditions for race/gender. I hadn't thought about figuring out the transformation for when the robe animates and deforms and the fact that the tabard texture wasn't made with any reference points to figure out how it should behave during the animations.<br />
<br />
/sigh<br />

I'm with Blizzard, there -- really, I am. God knows, being a programmer myself, I know it's more fun to do new stuff than it is to spend time fixing old bugs and inconsistencies and overhauling stuff that, in retrospect, seems pretty silly. I just hope that after this coming expansion, they make a stand and go back and spend the time to pull out the brass-o and polish some of the older content and address some of the long-standing, little, annoying things like this tabard issue. There's a pretty big list by now.</div></div><hr />

Any further verification on this?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Digitrevx</div><div class="date">2008-03-13, 01:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The problem is the existing models do not have texture position information for where on the models the extra texture has to go. So they would have to go back through each model and add an extra set of texture co-ordinates to each vertex, this would probably require a change to the model file format as well as needing to have an artist go through each model and correctly set the new coordinate information for the tabard texture. <br />

I can think of at least 2 other simple ways to do it off hand. Even considering I’ve never touched their engine.<br />
Problem is its a lot of repetitive and labor intensive work no mater which path you take.<br />
Over all is it really a game breaking bug? Probably not so blizzard made the call that it does not affect the players experience.<br />
<br />
This happens often, and I've been put in similar situations. If their artist are anything like me I bet they wish they could invest some time to fix it.<br />
<br />
btw you mean UV's *wink*</div></div><hr />
