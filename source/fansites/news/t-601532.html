Yes Voice Chat is planned for 2.2. No it is not available yet. When it is available expect an announcement because we intend to do a lot of testing on it. <br />
<br />
It's posted on the Test Realm forum under current PTR issues. So there's your confirmation it's going in.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, and there's this thread (Sticky): http://forums.wow-europe.com/thread.html?topicId=301910494&amp;sid=1 <br />
<br />
the Voice Chat system is not yet active in this first version of patch 2.2.. <br />
<br />
So yeah it's pretty much confirmed that we're getting it in 2.2. Unless of course some major show-stopping bug comes up, which I don't think will happen.</div></div><hr />

How much will the arena shields cost, and (just a suggestion) would be nice to get a list of weps / shields from the<br />
arena aswell; as a supplement to the awsome Armor Showroom :) Possible? :)</div></div><hr />
