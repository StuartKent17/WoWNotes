&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;New&quot; changes!<br />
I found an old notebook in a box and so I wanted to share some changes we're expecting to come through.<br />
<br />
In patch 1.10 we're going to make it so that when you're at level cap completing quests will turn XP into gold. So that should be a good change, there will still be a reason to complete quests at max level. We're also going to update some items. In BRD almost all items are going to become blue quality, so that should be a nice upgrade for people. Also all bracers, belts, and gloves will be BoE. Which should help get more people geared up through the AH to tackle this difficult dungeon.<br />
<br />
We'll keep you updated should we find any other old notes that are no longer new or exciting. <br />
<br />
[...] To expand on Bashiok's feedback, we'd also like to note that we're happy right now with priests feeling unique via their racial abilities. It's compelling gameplay for dwarf priests to get to keep Fear Ward to themselves. <br />
<br />
These are some good changes, but can we get a better way to manage keys? I hate having to cripple my inventory space by making room for keys, there should really be a keychain or keyring of some kind...<br />
We like the physical nature of holding keys in your bags and bank. That said we are trying to reduce the number of keys given by attunements and required to enter dungeons and the like. In the future we hope that keys will be mostly temporary items, although that is subject to change. We're also trying to keep better tabs on the number of equippable items we're creating that dual-purpose as keys. <br />
<br />
<br />
Blue Posts<br />
Item Level Requirements in Instances<br />
The item level requirement was added to help players better gauge whether or not they might be ready to take on that content. We were seeing a lot of issues before where people were upset that someone was in a group that just didn't have the gear to take on the encounters. Or conversely they (personally) were upset that they didn't seem to be able to overcome an instance despite thinking they were ready for it. So, we've sort of baked in a system to better identify &quot;readiness&quot;. It's merely a tool to indicate possible preparedness, not an indicator of skill or lack of skill.<br />
<br />
We've mentioned it before, but it doesn't hurt to repeat, that we have been putting some thought into easing the requirement for premade or guild groups in the dungeon finder since those groups may want to help carry a lesser geared player through the encounter and generally have better overall coordination for achieving the completion of the dungeon. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/157527/item-level-does-not-equal-skill))<br />
<br />
Low level balance<br />
The designers are actually actively looking over some of the lower level balance to try to ensure that those who either actively play those brackets or level up through them are having a good, balanced time. Most of the changes made were to serve the questing experience and introduction of abilities to new players, but certainly there's a possibility for some changes to be made and still keep that goal. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/157653/hey-blizz-go-make-a-new-toon-now-plix))<br />
<br />
Heroic gear should drop randomly!<br />
That's kind of the point of ... points (justice/valor). Even if you're not getting what you want you're eventually getting what you want. More or less. You'd also be blowing out drop tables to a pretty insane degree. Not too bad for a game like Diablo. Pretty bad for a game like WoW.<br />
<br />
Also that system of allowing any boss to drop any item in Diablo II really encouraged some very bad forms of gameplay. It devolved into doing 'runs' of the easiest or most efficient bosses. Not exactly interesting. It's something we're actively trying to avoid repeating with Diablo III, and not something we'd want to encourage in World of Warcraft. :) (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/157645/heroic-gear-should-drop-randomly-instead-of))<br />
<br />
Bug - Treants sharing the same texture<br />
The issue where all treant models share the same texture (including Withers and the Teldrassil Sproutling) is something we're aware of and we're hoping to resolve soon. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/157396/white-war-talbuk))<br />
<br />
White Talbuk &quot;bug&quot; in 4.0.6<br />
Correct! We discovered that the wrong texture had been applied to the White War Talbuks horns n hooves, but since we liked it, and you guys liked it, and it felt like a good fit for the art design in Outland, we decided to keep it. <br />
<br />
[...] As it happens, you'll get to enjoy the new textures for a bit longer. Since this issue isn't something that can be hotfixed, we currently expect the talbuk to return to its former state with a future patch. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/157396/white-war-talbuk))<br />

By the way, there is a thread here on MMO-Champion which listed nearly 300 of the changes made to the game. It was an awesome nostalgia thread because it wasnt describing it using rose-tinted glasses. It listed every single thing that SUCKED and were changed for the better.</div></div><hr />

<br />
how it helps is that when there are more Tol'vir Digsites overall, theres more chance of one popping up, the fact that you can make a little gold from grey items was good enough for me to try and get my recipe again but with more chances for tol'vir digsites its like making archaeology a proper profession not like ......

<br />
Well, as stated in the Box it is an old patch note he found on his laptop. Man i wish all those cry babies that mourn constantly about upcoming patches today would read those old notes. In present time every patch brings a huge overhaul of classes, instances, items, professions and back then &quot;BRD dropps now blue items wohooo&quot; can you imagine a near end content Instance dropping only greens? <br />
<br />
I think the next patch should be something like: &quot;Increased the critter respawn rate, so people can get their achievement faster&quot; nothing else!</div></div><hr />

Fishing is just amazing (in Cataclysm). You can easily make 1000-1500 gold while waiting in queue for a dungeon, for example. Even more, depending on your server's economy. I guess it's one of the most profitable things you can do when in a hurry to gather some money, honestly.</div></div><hr />

Because instead of 3 Night Elf digsites+ 1 Tol´vir, you can now be luck and get 3 Tol´vir digsites+1 Night Elf</div></div><hr />

It devolved into doing 'runs' of the easiest or most efficient bosses. Not exactly interesting. It's something we're actively trying to avoid repeating with Diablo III, and not something we'd want to encourage in World of Warcraft.<br />
Do you think bosses dropping the same loot is any better or more interesting? Want a nice sword? Go to wowhead, find out which boss you have to kill and kill him with your guild or team. <br />
<br />
I think you underestimate the strength of diablo2 <br />
- no reliance on tank and healers means you don't have to give every single mob 1 million hp and don't have to make every single mob hit like a truck in instances to make the game challenge<br />
- bosses not always dropping epics and not always the same loot means, people don't just go for the same boss until they get what they want, it also means you don't have to make a single item bop etc.</div></div><hr />

Taurens and N; Elves have lots in common but yet, can't live together... the Humans reject their Forsaken brethen but accept the Death Knight ones. Demons are the cause of half of Azeroth problems and yet Warlock openly summon them.<br />
<br />
I am sure someone will give me a &quot;reasonable&quot; explanation for it and I don't care. A game lore should be acceptable, not explainable.<br />
<br />
What exactly is this guys problem? Didn't he play WC III? <br />
Sylvanas killed Garithos, thus making enemies of the humans. She also explicitly said that the forsaken have to find &quot;their own way&quot; now.<br />
NEs and Taurens do work together, look at the Circle of Cenarius. However, the Tauren have a blood debt to the Orcs, because they saved them from extinction by the hands of the centaurs. So if the Orcs fight, the Tauren aid them in battle.</div></div><hr />

^ Exactly. I love how he said he didn't care for an explanation. If he didn't care for one he'd have kept his gripe to himself. The lore is fine. It's a game. Go with it. :)</div></div><hr />

I really hope they do look at low level pvp brackets. Do you know how hard it is to pvp as a warrior when you get snared constantly? Or how hard it is to be a caster when you're silenced most of the time?<br />
<br />
the warrior thing stays EXACTLY the same at 85</div></div><hr />

I wouldn't go so far as to say game lore is &quot;fine&quot;. It's actually fairly inconsistent and awful in places, but it's important to remember that this is a game not a movie or a book. In true &quot;fiction&quot; the story *is* the entertainment. Everything else is secondary to a coherent narrative. In games the game play is the focus, story is secondary. Are there holes in WoW lore? Sure, but most of them are there to facilitate game play in one way or another, and Blizzard papers over over them to avoid totally breaking immersion. <br />
<br />
If Warcraft were primarily a series of books, movies, or even comics and it did all the retconning and strange pulling explanations out of it's ass stuff it does... Well, it would be terrible. It's not though, it's a game, and a fun game. The lore supports that well enough, and allows us to enjoy ourselves and challenge ourselves in instances, raids and PvP. I like Warcraft Lore, I read the quests and even the books. I just ignore the inconsistencies. Books in the various Dungeons and Dragons worlds suffer from similar problems. You can see the game poking through here and there. Just ignore it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, if you want the old chart you'll have to dig back a bit in news posts -- it's showing pre and post 450 skill (as in, you won't get Tol'Vir at all until you hit 450 skill).<br />
<br />
Edit: here's the news with the old chart, for comparison: http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/817883-Guides-Contest-Chimaeron-s-First-Kill-Archaeology-Distribution-Blue-Post-Artworks</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zaydin</div><div class="date">2011-02-11, 07:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You missed a few dig sites. THere's also a Tol'vir digsite at Neferset City in Uldum, and a Nerubian digsite at Kolramas in Zul'drak added.</div></div><hr />

Correct! We discovered that the wrong texture had been applied to the White War Talbuks horns n hooves, but since we liked it, and you guys liked it, and it felt like a good fit for the art design in Outland, we decided to keep it.<br />
<br />
[...] As it happens, you'll get to enjoy the new textures for a bit longer. Since this issue isn't something that can be hotfixed, we currently expect the talbuk to return to its former state with a future patch.<br />
<br />
I hope they fix the gladiator's nether drakes model. Their necks are broken!</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kashra</div><div class="date">2011-02-11, 11:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmmm Tol'Vir artifacts still spawn in Uldum (only). How's that going to affect the annoying problem of diging aroudn the world while you wait for Uldum digsites pop up?<br />
<br />
If they add seven sites in Uldum or seven sites in other random places (which would not make sense) it is still seven more places that have a chance to pop up means a higher chance the see Tol'vir sites. In fact as I see no other sites added in this patch in Kalimdor and all the new ones are all concentrated in the same area it means there is a greater chance that you will not have to fly as far for the next one as there is a greater chance of one popping in the same zone now. Adding them outside Tol'vr would cause what you are actually complaining about, just pick the site close to Uldum while you wait to reduce fly time, its really no different to digging in EK/North/OL where you can get all sites pop on the other side of the world than you, so many times I would have four sites in Shadowmoon only to have the next four spawn in the Netherstorm or vice versa, that's just archaeology for you.</div></div><hr />
