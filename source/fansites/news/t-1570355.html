Beta Realm Maintenance - 8/11/14<br />
It looks like we may get a new beta build today!<br />
Greetings All!<br />
<br />
The Beta realms will be coming down for maintenance tonight order to deploy a new build. I'll be updating this thread with information and time estimates as I receive them. I don't have an ETA at this time, but I will update this post if I receive one.<br />
<br />
I'll be leaving this thread open for general discussion as long as people remain civil and follow forum rules.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, yes, Demons are back, it's Gul'dan, Teron'gor and the Gang summoning the Demons! &lt;3 You should also read the comic, look at the art for WoD, Burning Legion is back in WoD, and I'm betting on Mannoroth last boss for WoD! &lt;3<br />
<br />
Not all Orcs drink it though, most don't, but some do.</div></div><hr />

Thats makes sense, considering the novel &quot;Guldan and the Stranger&quot; happened just before that ceremony. Probably Grom will refuse drinking, leaving both Gul'dan and Kill'jaeden pissed in the process.</div></div><hr />

Hahahaha yea yea I know, what I mean is, would be nice to have this kind of graphics quality. Doesn't need to be on the same level, just as awesome.<br />

Wonder if WoW was allowed to be modded like Elder Scrolls and Fallout games, how awesome it could be(graphically).</div></div><hr />

I can guarantee you, for a game to look that good you would need a videocard that doesn't exist yet lol. I do not underestimate gaming rigs currently available, but rendering a game at that quality in real time is about 10 years away.</div></div><hr />

I think you overestimate PC graphics cards. A game on that quality would not be playable. Not even on Quad SLI titan.<br />

There's a reason why a 3 min movie in that quality takes about a few months to render, and that's on professional machines designed for it.</div></div><hr />

I would say more. Technology isn't moving along fast enough to render this kind of quality live, without lag or stutter at a consumer price point.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You also have to remember that games tend to pull back on the graphics a bit to service those with older machines. I would say 30-40 years so its good to know that my children/grandchildren will have some fucking awesome graphics to play with XD.</div></div><hr />

Yeah also remember. That when something like this gets invented, it take another 5-10 years before it hits the market commercially.<br />

You underestimate the power required to run a game of that graphical fidelity. Even the most cutting edge gaming PC wouldn't be able to run a game in real time that looked like that. I mean we're still having to rely on the trickery of normal maps in even the best looking games, we're miles away from having games looking like that screen shot.</div></div><hr />

Aye. The pinnacle of real time rendering then would have been Doom, look at how primitive it looks compared to today's standards. Now we have the Oculus Rift in development and various projects incorporating haptic technology.<br />

20 years from now they will be developing early full immersion tech via implanted computers or possibly something similar to the holodeck used in Star Trek.</div></div><hr />

Even the most cutting edge gaming PC wouldn't be able to run a game in real time that looked like that. I mean we're still having to rely on the trickery of normal maps in even the best looking games, we're miles away from having games looking like that screen shot.<br />
<br />
Not really. The trees are procedural, the polygonal details are not that much of a deal. In 5 years games will look like that an better.<br />
Games like Crysis 3 already look like this:<br />

<br />
You can expect very impressive graphics in the next few years when GPUs get unified virtual 3d memory and NVlink.<br />
Check the Nvidia Pascal presentation. We will finally get rid of the PCI bottleneck.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Like I said 2 messages up, this is the Throne of Kil'jaden in Tanaan Jungle, where Doomlord Kazak can be found in Outlands, north of Thrallmar.<br />
<br />
<br />
The Throne of Kil'jaeden is a massive mountain located at ([63, 16]); north of the Horde outpost of Thrallmar on Outland's Hellfire Peninsula. The mountain was so named by the warlock Gul'dan. Now that Lord Kazzak has re-opened the Dark Portal, he can be found here (as Doom Lord Kazzak), and notably much stronger than before. The troops of the Throne are comprised primarily of doom lords and infernals, numbering in the thousands. To this day not a single army has successfully attacked the throne</div></div><hr />

That place has historical significance before it was named like that. It the place where the clan leaders drunk demon blood and thus became a weapon of the legion.<br />
<br />
Also we know that Garrosh wants the iron horde, but also wants to prevent the blood drinking part. Further more as shown in the latest comic, he might be coming to this party.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No its not. Read what i said again.<br />
<br />
<br />
errr what? technology is moving at an incredible pace. consider what we had 20 years ago. Technology is advancing at proportionally exponential rate.<br />
<br />
<br />
As you seem to either not know what that means or ignored it, &quot;Proportionally exponential rate&quot; means stuff that is rising at an increasing rate over time.<br />
<br />
Which our technology is doing. we will accomplish many times the rate of technological development in the next 20 years than in the previous 20 given current models and growth rate. there is NO slowing down going on. Unless we have a dark age.<br />

It's not really a new continent per se. We've seen it before it's just going to be looking a bit different. New character models as part of the expansion is disingenuous. And Blizzard always tinkered with skills at the start of every expansion. The long and the short of it is that this &quot;expansion&quot; is pretty underwhelming when compared to what Blizzard put out before. The only feature I'm remotely excited about is toy box, the rest is fluff.</div></div><hr />

It's made from scratch and looks nowhere the same, only thing that remains is the shape of the continent. That's pretty new in my book.</div></div><hr />

Common misconception. The draenor we're going to is set in current time, but is a copy pulled from 20-some years ago. While they may not drink the blood this time around, it doesn't have an actual affect on the current timeline.</div></div><hr />

Tells us alot about the future of this game and why ppl really should not bother with it.<br />
<br />
Sub based games require trust in the developer to do his part. Blizzard has proved again and again with this expansion that they can not be trusted.<br />
<br />
Ok, i'll bite. What would you have them do? Quietly wrap up work and put it out without any kind of announcement at all? Should they just close up shop for good now? &quot;We done screwed up. Duster is mad. No point even releasing it now.&quot;<br />
<br />
It's late. They know it. We know it. I want it out now and let them catch up on content while we play. I want the game to continue being made. That means people need to know its coming and need to be told why its worth buying. They need to know that it has a starter level 90 to get into the action with. Everyone is complaining about the price but the new character never gets mentioned as a feature. That's a huge value for an extra 10 dollars.<br />
<br />
They've lost 6 million subscribers in the last 5 years. The presence of a level 90 MUST be communicated to lapsed players and new players. Hence the &quot;hype&quot; for the release. I can't believe they aren't running promotions every single week to get people to pre-order the expansion and start playing now. Once we have a firm date in place, people are more likely to pre-order to take advantage of the level 90 character.</div></div><hr />

Retarded quote of the day. It's not like every game developer ever builds hype on their products before they are released. :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

Since the achievment for defeating Ragnaros is listed in Warlords Of Draenor patch i'm assuming it's part of WoD. So late september/early October is my guess.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It is also during the same period of ArcheAge's 3rd beta event so likely something to do with that as well. Similar thing happened with Wildstar and the 100% valor buff :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not on an MMO.</div></div><hr />

Hope the emerald drake is a drop from a legacy boss. That outdated model shouldn't be used for anything else</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes it would since latest MMOs almost has that quality graphics ... like Tera Online and FF I guess. I'd pay 50e for totally revamped engine with up to date graphics.</div></div><hr />
