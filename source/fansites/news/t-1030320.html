Diablo 3 - Even with the patch coming I'm still working on shiny new Diablo stuff! Today on Diablofans we have a nice Diablo 3 Mystic and Item Enhancements Preview (http://www.diablofans.com/)!<br />
<br />
Patch 4.3 on live realms this week<br />
Patch 4.3 will be deployed on live realms this week, as usual there is a 1% chance that it will not happen if something goes really wrong but you should expect to be able to enter the Dragon Soul raid and kick deathwing's ... butt? on November 29th in the US and November 30th in EU. Time for the giant recap of what to expect from this patch!<br />
<br />
Raid Finder<br />
The new Raid Finder tool (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/623-Patch-4.3-Raid-Finder/) is a new way to build raids similar to the Looking for Dungeon tool. You can now queue for a 25-man raid and pretty much instantly jump in the fight to get your shiny epics! It also comes with a new &quot;Looking for Raid&quot; difficulty that makes bosses easier and puggable. <br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Raid Instance - Dragon Soul<br />
A new raid instance is added to the game with this patch, the Dragon Soul instance will allow you to face Deathwing himself and potentially defeat him. <br />

<br />
Tier 13 Armor Sets<br />
New raid instance means new Tier armor sets and the Tier 13 might be one of the best design we've seen in a while! <br />

<br />
<br />
Valor Points Rewards and Raid Loot<br />
A lot of gear has been added in this patch, you can get a lot of gear for your character from the Patch 4.3 Valor Points Rewards (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/179-Patch-4.3-Valor-Points-Rewards/) and for those of you who don't want to check individual bosses loot lists, we have a nice Dragon Soul Raid Loot List (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/2556-Dragon-Soul-Raid-Loot-Compilation-Fan-Art).<br />
<br />
<br />
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2011/november/valorpoint_th.jpg (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/179-Patch-4.3-Valor-Points-Rewards/) http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2011/november/raidlootlist_th.jpg (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/2556-Dragon-Soul-Raid-Loot-Compilation-Fan-Art)<br />
<br />
Also, Valor Points are now earned at the same rate in 10 and 25-man instances now. <br />
We've made slight adjustments to the Valor Point (VP) drops on the 4.3 PTR which testers can now see. In both 10- and 25-player raids, bosses will now drop 100 VP each (down from 115 and 135 respectively). We’ll also be changing Firelands raid bosses to drop 50 VP per kill upon release of the patch.<br />
<br />
This change is being made to further emphasize the desire to kill bosses for the items they drop. In the 4.3 raid, tier sets can only be earned from boss drops, and as Raid Finder will allow for just about anyone to get a chance to kill bosses, we think there will be less need for Valor overall. We want to try to match the lower desire for VP with a slightly slower acquisition rate.<br />
<br />
We appreciate your thoughts and constructive discussion on how these changes may affect you and your guild once 4.3 is released.<br />
<br />
<br />
5-Man Instances - Well of Eternity, Hour of Twilight, and End Time<br />
Three new 5-man instances are added to the game! The Well of Eternity (http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/1030252-Well-of-Eternity-Strategy-Loot-Discussions?p=14391262#post14391262), Hour of Twilight (http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/1030251-Hour-of-Twilight-Strategy-Loot-Discussions?p=14391261#post14391261), and End Time (http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/1030253-End-Time-Strategy-Loot-Discussions?p=14391266#post14391266) instances are all located in the Caverns of Time. <br />

This patch adds almost 20 mounts to the game, and we already have the drop locations for more than 10 of them! Check out the Patch 4.3 Mounts (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/655-Patch-4.3-Mounts)!<br />

<br />
<br />
Patch 4.3 Companion Pets<br />
15 new companion pets have been added to the game in Patch 4.3, a lot of them are from the new Darkmoon Faire but there's also a couple of collector mounts, and even a Sea Pony! Check out the Patch 4.3 Companion Pets (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/654-Patch-4.3-Companion-Pets/). <br />

<br />
Darkmoon Faire Reworked - Darkmoon Faire Island!<br />
The Darkmoon Faire has been completely reworked and got its own zone, it's now MUCH bigger and is located on the Darkmoon Faire Island! Feel free to read Patch 4.3 Darkmoon Faire (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/2543-Patch-4.3-The-New-Darkmoon-Faire-is-on-Test-Realms!/). <br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Season 11 Armor Sets and PvP Rewards<br />
For all the PvPers out there we have a nice list of Season 11 Armor Sets and PvP Gear (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/659-Season-11-Armor-Sets-Patch-4.3/)!<br />
<br />
<br />
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2011/november/s11_th.jpg (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/659-Season-11-Armor-Sets-Patch-4.3/)<br />
<br />
Don't forget that you can also earn Conquest points from regular battlegrounds victories now, and the amount of Conquest points earned in Rated BG has been considerably increased.<br />
In patch 4.3 we’re changing the daily battleground (BG) to reward 100 conquest for a win (up from 25). In addition, every non-rated BG that you win will also give you 50 conquest. There is no limit to how many BGs you can run this way, up to the normal conquest cap.<br />
<br />
Our intent is to start acting even more on our Mists of Pandaria philosophies of encouraging players to approach the content they want to, how they want to, and be able to work toward meaningful player progression. Arenas and rated battlegrounds will still earn Conquest faster, but with this change you can now work your way up by running normal BGs, if you so choose.<br />
<br />
<br />
Patch Notes<br />
This is not the final version of the patch notes, only the latest update of the test realm notes. There might be a few changes in the final version but most of the changes are here. <br />
&lt;script&gt;$(function () { ttlib.init(); })&lt;/script&gt; &lt;b&gt;World of Warcraft PTR Patch 4.3.0&lt;/b&gt;<br />
<br />
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;General&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;<br />
&lt;ul&gt;<br />
&lt;li&gt;New Dungeon &amp;amp; Raid Content<br />
&lt;ul&gt;<br />
&lt;li&gt;End Time (http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/1030253-End-Time-Strategy-Loot-Discussions?p=14391266#post14391266) is now available.<br />
&lt;li&gt;Hour of Twilight (http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/1030251-Hour-of-Twilight-Strategy-Loot-Discussions?p=14391261#post14391261) is now available.<br />
&lt;li&gt;Well of Eternity (http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/1030252-Well-of-Eternity-Strategy-Loot-Discussions?p=14391262#post14391262) is now available.<br />
&lt;li&gt;The new Baradin Hold boss, Alizabal, is now available.<br />
&lt;li&gt;Dragon Soul is now available.&lt;/li&gt;<br />
<br />
&lt;/ul&gt;<br />
&lt;/li&gt;<br />
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/623-Patch-4.3-Raid-Finder/&quot;&gt;Raid Finder&lt;/a&gt;<br />
&lt;ul&gt;<br />
&lt;li&gt;This new grouping feature allows players to quickly and easily form a pick-up raid for a specially tuned version of the current tier of endgame content: the Dragon Soul raid. Raid Finder is now available.<br />
&lt;/ul&gt;<br />
&lt;/li&gt;<br />
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/622-Patch-4.3-Transmogrification/&quot;&gt;Transmogrification&lt;/a&gt;<br />
&lt;ul&gt;<br />
&lt;li&gt;This new feature allows players to customize their gear like never before. You'll find Transmogrification, Void Storage, and Reforging vendors in Cathedral Square, Stormwind and The Drag, Orgrimmar. The costs associated with this service are not yet final.&lt;/li&gt;<br />
&lt;/ul&gt;<br />
&lt;/li&gt;<br />
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/621-Patch-4.3-Void-Storage/&quot;&gt;Void Storage&lt;/a&gt;<br />
&lt;ul&gt;<br />
&lt;li&gt;In addition to the bank, players will now have access to a new &quot;deep storage&quot; system, allowing characters to free bag space by setting aside coveted gear. You'll find Transmogrification, Void Storage, and Reforging vendors in Cathedral Square, Stormwind and The Drag, Orgrimmar. The costs associated with this service are not yet final.&lt;/li&gt;<br />
&lt;/ul&gt;<br />
<br />
&lt;/li&gt;<br />
&lt;li&gt;Reforging<br />
&lt;ul&gt;<br />
&lt;li&gt;The former Reforging vendors have been... retired. The ethereals have chosen to take over the business and joined their Transmogrification and Void Storage service providers. You'll find them in Cathedral Square, Stormwind and The Drag, Orgrimmar.&lt;/li&gt;<br />
&lt;/ul&gt;<br />
&lt;/li&gt;<br />
&lt;li&gt;Outland &amp;amp; Northrend Quest Flow<br />
&lt;ul&gt;<br />
&lt;li&gt;The amount of experience needed to gain levels 71 through 80 has been reduced by approximately 33%.&lt;/li&gt;<br />
&lt;li&gt;Many Group quests in Outland and Northrend have been re-tuned to allow players to complete them solo. They are no longer labeled as Group quests.&lt;/li&gt;<br />
&lt;li&gt;Relevant questgivers have been moved into Outland and Northrend dungeons. The majority of dungeon quests for these zones are now available from within their respective dungeons.&lt;/li&gt;<br />
&lt;/ul&gt;<br />
&lt;/li&gt;<br />
&lt;li&gt;North American realms (excluding Brazilian, Latin American, and Oceanic realms) no longer permit letters with accents in character or guild names. Existing character and guild names with special characters will be unaffected by this change.&lt;/li&gt;<br />
&lt;/ul&gt;<br />
&lt;br /&gt;<br />
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Achievements&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;<br />
&lt;ul&gt;<br />
&lt;li&gt;The achievement Master of Alterac Valley (http://db.mmo-champion.com/a/1168/) no longer requires the Alterac Valley Blitz (http://db.mmo-champion.com/a/226/the-alterac-blitz/) achievement.&lt;/li&gt;<br />
<br />
&lt;li&gt;<br />
&lt;p&gt;The achievement Tol Barad Veteran (http://db.mmo-champion.com/a/5418/) now requires 25 victories in Tol Barad, down from 100.&lt;/p&gt;<br />
&lt;/li&gt;<br />
&lt;/ul&gt;<br />
&lt;br /&gt;<br />
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Classes: General&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;<br />
&lt;ul&gt;<br />
&lt;li&gt;All raid and party buffs which grant group members 10% increased attack power have been changed slightly. They continue to provide 10% increased ranged attack power, but now provide 20% increased melee attack power.<br />
&lt;ul&gt;<br />
&lt;li&gt;Abomination's Might (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/53138/): The melee attack power bonus from this raid buff has been increased to 10/20%, up from 5/10%. The ranged attack power bonus remains 5/10%.&lt;/li&gt;<br />
&lt;li&gt;Blessing of Might (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/19740/): The melee attack power bonus from this raid buff has been increased to 20%, up from 10%. The ranged attack power bonus remains 10%.&lt;/li&gt;<br />
&lt;li&gt;Runescroll of Might (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/67231/): The melee attack power bonus from this consumable has been increased to 16%, up from 8%. The ranged attack power bonus remains 8%.&lt;/li&gt;<br />
&lt;li&gt;Trueshot Aura (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/19506/): The melee attack power bonus from this raid buff has been increased to 20%, up from 10%. The ranged attack power bonus remains 10%.&lt;/li&gt;<br />
&lt;li&gt;Unleashed Rage (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/30808/): The melee attack power bonus from this raid buff has been increased to 10/20%, up from 5/10%. The ranged attack power bonus remains 5/10%.&lt;/li&gt;<br />
<br />
&lt;/ul&gt;<br />
&lt;/li&gt;<br />
&lt;li&gt;Vengeance (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/93098/) for Protection warriors, Protection paladins, Blood death knights, and Feral druids has been redesigned slightly. It no longer ramps up slowly at the beginning of a fight. Instead, the first melee attack taken by the tank generates Vengeance (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/93098/) equal to 33% of the damage taken by that attack. In addition, as it updates periodically during the fight, it's always set to at least 33% of the damage taken by the tank in the last 2 seconds.

&lt;br /&gt;<br />
Bug Fixes<br />
&lt;ul&gt;<br />
&lt;li&gt;Fixed a bug that caused Doomguard and Infernal to benefit dramatically more than intended from Demonology Mastery.&lt;/li&gt;<br />
&lt;/ul&gt;<br />
<br />
&lt;br /&gt;<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/iwarriors.gif Warrior (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/278-Warrior) / Talent Calculator (http://www.wowtal.com/#k=..warrior) / Skills/Talents (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/1676-Warrior-Cataclysm))<br />
&lt;ul&gt;<br />
&lt;li&gt;Charge (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/100/charge/) (and related abilities) should now correctly path to a target even if the target moves during the Charge (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/100/charge/). This change should decrease the likelihood of the warrior Charging to a different location than the target.&lt;/li&gt;<br />
&lt;li&gt;Slam (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/1464/) now uses a new character attack animation.&lt;/li&gt;<br />
&lt;li&gt;Colossus Smash (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/86346/) now uses a new character attack animation.&lt;/li&gt;<br />
&lt;/ul&gt;<br />
<br />
&lt;br /&gt;<br />
Arms<br />
&lt;ul&gt;<br />
&lt;li&gt;Mortal Strike (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/12294/) now reduces the target’s healing received by 25%, up from 10%.&lt;/li&gt;<br />
&lt;/ul&gt;<br />
<br />
&lt;br /&gt;<br />
Fury<br />
&lt;ul&gt;<br />
&lt;li&gt;Dual Wield Specialization (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/23588/) no longer increases Physical damage by 5%. It continues to increase off-hand attack damage by 25%.&lt;/li&gt;<br />
&lt;li&gt;Furious Attacks (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/56112/) now reduces the target’s healing received by 25%, up from 10%.&lt;/li&gt;<br />
&lt;/ul&gt;<br />
<br />
&lt;br /&gt;<br />
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dungeons &amp;amp; Raids&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;<br />
&lt;ul&gt;<br />
&lt;li&gt;Dungeon Journal entries have been added for the new dungeons: &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/1030253-End-Time-Strategy-Loot-Discussions?p=14391266#post14391266&quot;&gt;End Time&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/1030252-Well-of-Eternity-Strategy-Loot-Discussions?p=14391262#post14391262&quot;&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/1030251-Hour-of-Twilight-Strategy-Loot-Discussions&quot;&gt;Hour of Twilight&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://us.battle.net/wow/en/blog/3516572/Patch_43_Raid_Preview_Dragon_Soul-9_19_2011&quot;&gt;Dragon Soul&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;<br />
<br />
&lt;li&gt;Players who use Dungeon Finder for a random Heroic dungeon will no longer be locked to that instance. Previously, players who entered an instance via the Random Dungeon option were then prohibited from queuing for that dungeon or entering the instance manually via the portal. Players should now always be able to complete a specific Heroic dungeon once per day regardless of any random dungeons completed.&lt;/li&gt;<br />
&lt;li&gt;Ruins of Ahn'qiraj<br />
&lt;ul&gt;<br />
&lt;li&gt;Bosses in Ruins of Ahn'qiraj now drop a rare-quality Scarab Coffer Key (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/76401/) which can be used to open the Scarab Coffers found within. These keys are zone-bound to Ruins of Ahn'qiraj and have a 17-hour expiration. This change also applies to Greater Scarab Coffer Key (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/76402/)s used to open Large Scarab Coffers.&lt;/li&gt;<br />
&lt;/ul&gt;<br />
&lt;/li&gt;<br />
&lt;li&gt;Zul’Gurub<br />
&lt;ul&gt;<br />
&lt;li&gt;Players now only have to kill two of the four initial dungeon bosses (High Priest Venoxis, Broodlord Mandokir, High Priestess Kilnara, and Zanzil) to face Jin’do the Godbreaker.&lt;/li&gt;<br />
&lt;/ul&gt;<br />
&lt;/li&gt;<br />
&lt;li&gt;Zul’Aman<br />
&lt;ul&gt;<br />
&lt;li&gt;Players now only have to kill two of the four Troll avatars before they may face Hex Lord Malacrass.&lt;/li&gt;<br />
&lt;/ul&gt;<br />
&lt;/li&gt;<br />
&lt;/ul&gt;<br />
&lt;br /&gt;<br />
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Guilds&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;<br />
&lt;ul&gt;<br />
&lt;li&gt;Guild Standards are again useable in Firelands. Duration has been increased to 15 minutes, the effect has a 100 yard radius, and now affects dead players.&lt;/li&gt;<br />
<br />
&lt;/ul&gt;<br />
&lt;br /&gt;<br />
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Items&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;<br />
&lt;ul&gt;<br />
&lt;li&gt;Dragonwrath, Tarecgosa's Rest (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/71086/dragonwrath-tarecgosas-rest/): The chance for this item’s effect to be triggered has been reduced.&lt;/li&gt;<br />
&lt;/ul&gt;<br />
&lt;br /&gt;<br />
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Races&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;<br />
&lt;ul&gt;<br />
&lt;li&gt;The orc racial Blood Fury (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/33697/) now increases spell power rather than only spell damage.&lt;/li&gt;<br />
&lt;/ul&gt;<br />
&lt;br /&gt;<br />
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;User Interface&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;<br />
&lt;ul&gt;<br />
&lt;li&gt;Archaeology areas of interest will now show on the mini-map, in addition to the World Map.&lt;/li&gt;<br />
&lt;li&gt;Bag Search<br />
&lt;ul&gt;<br />
&lt;li&gt;A search field has been added to allow players to search bag, bank, guild bank, and Void Storage inventories for specific items.&lt;/li&gt;<br />
&lt;/ul&gt;<br />
&lt;/li&gt;<br />
&lt;li&gt;Guilds with inactive guild leaders can now usurp the leader under specific conditions. More information on this coming soon.&lt;/li&gt;<br />
&lt;li&gt;The Reforging interface has been updated and improved.&lt;/li&gt;<br />
&lt;li&gt;Quest Tracking areas or points of interest will now show on the mini-map, in addition to the World Map.&lt;/li&gt;<br />
&lt;li&gt;The World Map now displays the expected character levels for each zone.&lt;/li&gt;<br />
&lt;li&gt;Added a “promote everyone” checkbox that will automatically make all raid members, Raid assistants. This checkbox can be found in the Raid Frame and the Unit Frame “pull-out” tab.&lt;/li&gt;<br />
<br />
&lt;li&gt;There are now commands for world markers &amp;amp; unit markers.&lt;/li&gt;<br />
&lt;li&gt;Added new rotation, zoom, and pan controls are now available in all windows with player models in UI frames.&lt;/li&gt;<br />
&lt;li&gt;Players can now unlearn profession specialization without unlearning the profession (Engineering &amp;amp; Alchemy).&lt;/li&gt;<br />
&lt;li&gt;[Mac] Added functionality to allow using the Command key instead of the Control key on Apple keyboards. This can be enabled in Mac Options.&lt;/li&gt;<br />
&lt;li&gt;[Mac] Added functionality to disable Mac OS system keyboard shortcuts so that they do not interfere with keyboard shortcuts in WoW. This can be enabled in Mac Options.&lt;/li&gt;<br />
&lt;li&gt;Added a feature to interact with NPCs, game objects (mailbox, mining nodes, etc.), and corpses on left-click as well as right-click. There is now an option under Interface:Controls to turn this feature off.&lt;/li&gt;<br />
&lt;/ul&gt;</div></div><hr />

Except there is no such history. In fact, a patch is more likely to release on the same day a season ends than not, if you look at the dates instead of trusting memory.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The amount of experience needed to gain levels 71 through 80 has been reduced by approximately 33%.<br />
Many Group quests in Outland and Northrend have been re-tuned to allow players to complete them solo. They are no longer labeled as Group quests.<br />
Relevant questgivers have been moved into Outland and Northrend dungeons. The majority of dungeon quests for these zones are now available from within their respective dungeons.<br />
<br />
<br />
FML I just leveled 3 more characters through outlands and northrend. The dungeon quest changes are imo the nicest things by far.</div></div><hr />

It's the biggest patch to date and you think it's the lamest patch ever? Yeah that makes a lot of sense.</div></div><hr />

Players now only have to kill two of the four initial dungeon bosses (High Priest Venoxis, Broodlord Mandokir, High Priestess Kilnara, and Zanzil) to face Jin’do the Godbreaker.<br />

Players now only have to kill two of the four Troll avatars before they may face Hex Lord Malacrass.<br />

Since when is Boubouille a Blizzard employee and can make statements for them? Blizzard has not announced any date yet and the post made by Boubouille is stated wrong cause he should say he HOPES it goes live this week. Hoe does not know accuretly when the patch will go live. <br />
There has been always 1 week between a new patch and the stop of the current Arena season so the 6th of Dec is way more possible then this week!</div></div><hr />

The DTR is still miles ahead in terms of DPS, even post nerf, of any Heroic DS caster weapon, so you can still feel free using it and enjoying the best caster weapon in the game.<br />

<br />
Most likely any valor points will be converted to justice points, and anything over the 4000 justice point cap will be converted to gold, at the rate of 72 silver per valor point. That is how the conversion worked when Firelands came out.<br />
<br />
<br />
And the Raid Finder, will you be able to do that AND do your normal raid with your guild? Thanks!<br />

Yes, you can do both.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You must be new. Boub is never wrong. Is it official confirmation? No, but about as close as it can get. In the 3-4 years I have been coming here, he has only called the release of a patch wrong once. I think. And that was a long time ago.<br />

In beta there was a bug if you do normals 1st you can do LFR but if you did LFR you got saved to normals also. Ofc that is not what blizz want = bug. My question is that bug was fix?</div></div><hr />

I am a new member to the site, but that doesn't mean that I'm out of place for asking for sources. S11 ending tomorrow doesn't mean that the patch will drop, though I will give it to you that it is a strong indicator--though not compelling proof. Unless he's got an inside souce (good for him if he does), proclaiming something as fact without backing it up is irresponsible.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It would only be irresponsible if he is wrong. Besides, what would he cite? Blizzard never announces the date that a patch is coming, or if they do it won't be until after we are all loading the new files. If he has an inside source, he couldn't name them. So then people would just say that he is probably making it up anyway.<br />
<br />
A proven track record of accuracy is just as reliable as an official source. Boub has always said he won't put something on the front page unless he is almost 100% certain it is accurate. It is obvious he has sources on the inside, or some other means of verifying his information. He is correct far too often for that to not be the case. So eventually, like may people who have followed this site for a long time, you will learn to accept that what he posts is verified fact. He just can't source it.</div></div><hr />

Why not just get 4-piece Heroic T13 to upgrade your Heroic T12? Pretty sure that was the intended result.<br />

A new realm opening would not be connected to the patch release date at all. If anything, it would be much harder for a team to deploy a new realm AND a new patch at the same time, ans would point more toward tomorrow.</div></div><hr />

Rest of the 4.3 pre-patch files up on the download servers but not authorized for download by the launcher.<br />
<br />
<br />
Blizzard seldom releases a patch the same day a PvP season ends. Their typical pattern is they end a season, wipe MMR for the teams, and lock out Arenas and RBGs for a week. They only did it once, and that was when 4.0 (The Shattering patch, pre-Cata) happened. 8 hour maintenance could just be preparation for the patch on Dec. 6th. Bashiok's twitter comment could be relating to Dec. 6th and not Nov. 29th. He just said the season ends, not the patch releases that day (Keyword: INDIRECT). And the 4.3 pre-patch files are still being &quot;held&quot; on the servers likely until patch goes live and we download the final chunk that fully installs the patch.</div></div><hr />

Most Blizzard employees likely only worked 2-3 days last week, and they have only been back at work for about 2 hours now. Give them some time.<br />

<br />
Why do people keep believing/repeating this? In fact the reverse is true, Blizzard has NEVER started an arena season the same day as a patch.<br />
<br />
<br />
All is normal, all is usual - given Season 10 end was announced ...<br />
<br />
Season 1 : ended WITH patch 2.1.2 on June 19 2007<br />
Season 2 : ended TWO WEEKS AFTER patch 2.3.0 on November 26 2007<br />
Season 3 : ended independent of patch on June 23 2008<br />
Season 4 : ended WITH patch 3.0.2 on October 14 2008<br />
Season 5 : ended WITH patch 3.1.0 on April 14 2009<br />
Season 6 : ended independent of patch on August 25 2009<br />
Season 7 : ended TWO WEEKS BEFORE patch 3.3.2 on January 19 2010<br />
Season 8 : ended WITH patch 4.0.1 on October 12 2010<br />
Season 9 : ended WITH patch 4.2.0 on June 28 2011<br />
Season 10: ended WITH patch 4.3.0 on November 29 2011<br />

You being out DPSed by someone not using a DTR doesn't mean that DTR isn't the best caster weapon available...it just means you would have gotten beat much worse if that Mage had DTR.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You are actually the one person that's wrong. Yes, in terms of your own dps whoring DTR is best in slot for all caster dps, providing they have it. However the haste procs from that weapon, if provided that multiple casters own it (about 6-8 I think), it would buff the raid performance quite a bit. I don't know whether you know it or not, but that little bit of haste might send other dps/healers into a higher threshold they otherwise can't even reach.<br />
<br />
It's not always about your own dps, and the thing I've noticed from DTR owners, 95% of the owners didn't merit the staff and still can't do proper dps.</div></div><hr />

The arena season still ends on the 29th, regardless of whether the patch will go live or not. However, you'll still have a week time to spend your conquest points before the reset, which should happen a week after the end of this season.</div></div><hr />

We will be performing extended maintenance tomorrow, November 29, for the release of the 4.3: Hour of Twilight patch. The realms will be unavailable from 3:00 a.m. PST until approximately 11:00 a.m. PST.<br />
<br />
If your launcher states “World of Warcraft is up to date. Downloading data for the next update.&quot; please allow the Background Downloader to continue downloading the 4.3 data. You can ensure it continues even when not playing the game by going to the launcher Options, Downloader Preferences, and checking the box labeled “Download after exiting World of Warcraft”. If your launcher only states “World of Warcraft is up to date” then you’ve already obtained the 4.3 pre-download data and will only need a small update before logging in.<br />

If your launcher only states “World of Warcraft is up to date” then you’ve already obtained the 4.3 pre-download data and will only need a small update before logging in.<br />

<br />
Why wouldn't they? Sure, they're missing 300 Spirit, but the personal Haste proc would still be killer for them and would net the raid much higher rDPS than any other combination. It's not as if the fights don't have mechanics that make healing easier (looking at you Ultraxion).</div></div><hr />

&quot;But... but... but... Bobby Kotick will surely force Blizzard to withhold the patch until SWTOR comes out!&quot;<br />
Or some nonsense like that.</div></div><hr />

Not really if you have a look at the new crafted LW, BS, and I think Tailoring items in 4.3 they still require chaos orbs.</div></div><hr />

The first 3/4 of it felt pretty &quot;meh&quot;, but those last few seconds, Deathwing's going to be badass :D</div></div><hr />

Everything about this expansion is seriously lame....no good trailers, bad patches, awful story......</div></div><hr />

What kind of shit is this? This is as bad as the Call of the Crusade (patch 3.2) trailer.</div></div><hr />

I agree but its not to the same standard of the Icecrown one, but i can see why.</div></div><hr />

Maybe it's because Lich King as a villain has been with as since 10 years ago from Warcraft 3, it was a much bigger bond with the game and everything in it, when he was in it. It just felt 'right'. The Howling Fjord music, the atmoshphere, that time when Christmas is coming and you're there in Icecrown or Storm Peaks enjoying yourself, fooling around Dalaran which felt very 'magical' indeed, felt so soothing and warm just being there, fishing by the pool.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Saiju</div><div class="date">2011-11-29, 09:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm disappointed they didn't pull out all the stops for the end of the expansion raid. It shows in the boss models, it shows in the ridiculously simple fights (hopefully HC will be different), and it shows in this trailer which is pretty much just gameplay from 'interesting' angles.Blizzard has other priorities right now so it's not unexpected...</div></div><hr />
