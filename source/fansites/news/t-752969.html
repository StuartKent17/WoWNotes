I guess that works. Will try to get a better picture when the shiny little murloc appears in my game files.<br />
&quot;Death will rise from the tide!&quot; Level 80 Elite Tauren Chieftain once warned -- and at BlizzCon 2010, the band's dire musical prophecy will finally come to pass. Everyone who attends this year's BlizzCon or purchases the BlizzCon Virtual Ticket will receive an exclusive set of murlocalyptic in-game items for World of Warcraft and StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty. World of Warcraft players will be joined by Deathy, a murloc companion decked out as Deathwing and doing his best to strike fear into the hearts of Azeroth's crustacean population. You'll also be able to display your tidal pride in StarCraft II with a Murloc Marine character portrait and a pair of deep-sea decals to emblazon on your units, each with a different terran, protoss, and zerg design.<br />
<br />
BlizzCon 2010 takes place on October 22 and 23 at the Anaheim Convention Center. For further details or to order the BlizzCon Virtual Ticket, visit www.BlizzCon.com.<br />

Just once, can we please get a murloc pet that is obtainable in game (Not counting Murkimus)? I want one but I don't want to actually spend extra money.<br />
<br />
It doesn't have to be buyable, I just want a murloc pet from something I can actually do. :(<br />
<br />
Whining aside, I have to say I was disappointed. I was kind of expecting another pet, possibly even another murloc, but this is just milking Deathwing for all he's worth. By the time we get to him we'll be sick of his ugly mug. Hell, people were sick of the Lich King without his face plastered on everything with half a pulse.</div></div><hr />

I agree; we go from murloc suits to bear mounts to cheap companion pets. Guess I'll just buy the internet stream from now on and save myself the cost of an actual BlizzCon ticket.</div></div><hr />

Seriously?.<br />
<br />
let me get this straight, you think that... seriously?.<br />
<br />
cause of a(nother) murloc pet? seriously?. <br />
<br />
Thats just silly yo!.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I personally Will order and Watch the internet live stream, as I did last year. <br />
Watched it with my gf at the time and we had a good time, throughout the weekend.<br />
<br />
30 euros aint that much compared to the hours of footage you get.<br />
<br />
Granted it aint like going to the cinema in terms of quality. but its not trying to be.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This year is getting even better with several channels to swap between, so you can see the panels / tournaments you wanna see the most.<br />
<br />
And I will enjoy this murloc pet as much as the others. ( in fact this is gonna be my first, gf got the grunty from last year ), but my point still stands :p<br />
<br />
Its a fun little bonus you get, and even without a &quot;reward&quot; I would buy the stream anyway.<br />
<br />
<br />
So get over the whole omg another murloc whine!, sure a blizzard camel with spit animation and a nice flag would have been cool ( really cool ), but its just not how its gonna be.<br />
<br />
<br />
And the internet stream is still cool.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Whenever yet &quot;another&quot; pet is added together with other purchasable merchandise, people go all batshit crazy about it spending whatever money it costs just to get the pet. I get it that some like to collect, but seriously, seeing people pay 100 euros for the Starcraft Collections Edition just for the Thor pet makes me wonder if they even realise the value of money.<br />
<br />
And if those special pets could actually do something interesting other than follow you around and do the occasional idle emote, then I'd say it's reasonable. But spending real money on a useless, viritual pet in a game I already pay subscription money for? No thanks, I'd rather purchase proper merchandise which is worth it's value.<br />

They do have value, you may want to take a look at why you're so angry about it, jealously perhaps? &quot;Argh I don't like that thing, whoever buys it is wasting their money because I think it's pointless!&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
Scavenge news sites? Are you kidding me? People like you who buy it will make threads about it the second info is released. I'll know when you know and I won't have to spend 40 dollars. Pet is still a rip off. You're essentially paying 40 bucks for it and like I said you will have it out for a week and then never look at it again. Ripoff.</div></div><hr />

I agree with what others have mentioned, baby murlocs/vanity pets are getting old I'd rather much see mounts or cosmetic items being introduced with Blizzcon. Like say a SC Terran Vulture mount. Don't say it doesn't fit in WoW, there's already a 'mech mini pet ingame ;)<br />
<br />
And yes, anyone buying a stream of blizzcon is essentially just paying 40-50 bucks for the mini pet, the information you gain from the stream can be easily found on fan sites the second they're released.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah...Blizzard is sucking people dry of money...cause everyone is forced at gunpoint to buy everything Blizzard puts out there, right ? COULD it be that your little &quot;Daddy I want this&quot; sketch featured a dad that needed to learn to say NO to his spoiled little kid perhaps ? If a dad pays for things like this without thinking, its their own fault their kids grow up never to have learned how the real world works..<br />
<br />
And seriously...stop your stupid &quot;OMG Blizzard are greedy&quot; speeches. Its getting so fu***** old ! No one is forcing you to buy anything from them - not even your monthly subscription. You CAN just stop playing, you know.<br />
<br />
No one really cares if anyone buys this or not. Some do, some dont. But people love to bitch about it. Especially if they can do a little flaming on &quot;how greedy Blizzard is&quot;. The important thing is that the people that DO buy this do it because they want to...and with their own damn money. No one is spending YOUR money on it, so shut your mouth. No one that buys this cares if YOU think its worth it or not. And no one NOT buying this will &quot;convince&quot; others to not buy it if they want to.<br />
<br />
Its simple really.<br />
<br />
For the record, I will be buying the stream again this year. Because I want to, and because I think it was good value for money last year. And this year, the coverage will be even better.</div></div><hr />

You don't have to buy it.<br />
<br />
Are people really that dump? Or are they just mad at them/their parents for not making a better life for themselves, 'cause they can't afford it?<br />
<br />
I don't want to insult anyone, but it's really annoying when everyone is saying how greedy they are. First, learn what business is.</div></div><hr />

All stuff we'll get via the internet for free... plus a pet. Yeah, it's just a pet.</div></div><hr />

And where do you get HD streams for free?</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you really want to get all technical, we can.<br />
<br />
The stream is only available LIVE to the people that pay. Are there people that will stream the stream and by doing that, doing something they arent supposed to do ? Yes, ofc. But technically, if this didnt happen, you cant get the LIVE stream without paying. Same with the PPV in the US. You pay to watch it live, but its gonna be on the internet the next day at the latest. That doesnt mean its &quot;free&quot;. Its only &quot;free&quot; to you because you &quot;pirate it&quot; (for lack of a better word...I assume you know what I mean by this). <br />
<br />
You get loads of bloggers blogging about it live, sure. But again, you dont have the &quot;legal&quot; right to watch the stream unless you pay. Thats the basic fact.<br />
<br />
Not to mention:<br />
<br />
&quot;Access to exclusive BlizzCon merchandise sale occuring October 13-142&quot;<br />
<br />
Good luck getting that &quot;on the internet for free&quot; if you really wanna go all the way<br />
<br />
Yes, I know all the info is gonna be online very shortly after the stream, but it doesnt change the fact that people likes to pay to watch things live. You dont, and thats fine...thats your choice. You settle for the blogs from the live stream and the eventual crappy youtube clips, and thats enough for you...and its fine by me. But dont try to hide the basic facts that this isnt available &quot;free on the internet&quot; unless someone breaks the rules. And yes, I also know that no one is gonna go to jail for it, but I still choose to pay to watch the LIVE stream, just as I would choose to go see a concert live even though someone has his cellphone on and streams the music. Its not the same thing no matter how you cut it.</div></div><hr />

They do have value, you may want to take a look at why you're so angry about it, jealously perhaps? &quot;Argh I don't like that thing, whoever buys it is wasting their money because I think it's pointless!&quot;<br />
<br />
Like I said, I don't see the point of ingame pets, do you even understand the meaning of jealousy? I'm talking about the people who purchase the viritual Blizzcon ticket ONLY for the pet.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And why do you even care? It is their money, let them do what they want with it.<br />
<br />
There are many things I do not understand, especially when it comes to products. I don't understand people who buy a britney spears album or people who buy expensive sport shoes and not doing any sport in them. <br />
However it is their money and I would be the last one to look down upon them just because they bought something.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There are several sites that specialize in live streams of broadcasts of satellite tv using video capture from their users. If I wasn't going to be there waving to the camera I'm sure I could find a live broadcast online for free pretty quickly</div></div><hr />

<br />
No one is forcing anyone to buy anything. Don't like the minipet....tough. Think people are being ripped off?...tough.<br />
<br />
Just because you can't afford to buy the internet stream or the CE doesn't give you the right to put the people that can down.</div></div><hr />

If you wanna go ahead and read what I wrote, im not questioning that some people will &quot;pirate&quot; the stream...quoting myself:<br />

<br />
What &quot;fail in game reward&quot; is this ? As far as I know, the only murloc pet you can get in game is the Murkimus one from arena (or whatever, I dont PVP)<br />
<br />
Whats &quot;decent&quot; stuff ? What do you want ? 6 months of free game time ?<br />
<br />
Oh, and btw....if this is so fail...good thing you dont have to buy the stream then, huh ?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cetarari</div><div class="date">2010-08-26, 05:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I bought the stream last year since there's no way I could persuade my other half to cross the atlantic to be able to go to Blizzcon in person (I'm pretty sure he's afraid I'll want to go dressed as a Moonkin or something). I've just ordered it for this year too, the pet is a nice bonus (it's pretty cute)but I certainly wouldn't pay that just for an ingame pet. Last year I watched almost everything that they streamed and will probably do the same this year. I guess Deathy will take some of the sting out of my inability to get a pre-order Cata collector's edition (I so wanted the baby Deathwing pet).</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am excited about Blizzcon, but I am not excited about the pet... the mount yes, grunty yes, murloc suit YES but a murloc pet...not so much. (other examples of coolness: mini diablo and tyrael pet) <br />
<br />
WTB something more original. It is not hard, Blizzard is known for its ingenuity cmon.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I still bring out Grunty from time to time and have a laugh. All about the fun.<br />

What annoys me is that when they go &quot;business&quot; i lose the &quot;might &amp; magic&quot; feeling the game brings me... all of a sudden my game inmersion fades away</div></div><hr />
