Kael'thas<br />
For The Horde (http://www.for-the-horde.de) could experience more tries on Kael'thas tonight with the help of a GM (on the PTR).<br />
They reached the final phase of the fight and we've got a few screenshots ... But they also frapsed it, which means that a movie is on the way. <br />

I guess it goes for method the same as it was for us, we've always been behind the top raiding guilds only due to being on a relatively new server. When TBC came we could stand up to our hardcoryness and show the people who we are. Right now we're one of the top guilds alltogether :) (and that feels awsome :&gt;)</div></div><hr />
