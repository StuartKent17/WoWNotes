Patch 3.3.3 should be deployed during the next maintenance on live servers and it's time to mention a few interesting changes to the Dungeon Finder that I forgot to report in the past weeks. Tons of minor changes have been made to make your life easier but there are two changes that will probably make you very happy. <br />
<br />
First, the patch notes mention a change to &quot;skip&quot; the introduction of Culling of Stratholme. The change doesn't sound really exciting but it's actually a huge improvement over the previous version, you can basically talk to Chromie and skip all the roleplay to jump directly to the first Scourge wave. A couple of other tweaks have also been made to make the dungeon slightly faster and I'm pretty sure you won't skip it anymore. (Especially with a Deserter debuff extended to 30 minutes)<br />
<br />

<br />
The second major changes to the random dungeon system is the new vote kick system, you can now give a reason when you start a vote to kick someone. At some point it was mentioned in a blue post that the 15 minute limit before you can kick someone was gone, but it doesn't seem to be the case in the current build of the PTR. We will have to wait and see how it works on the live servers.<br />
<br />

<br />
These changes were in the patch notes but I think they're definitely worth a small dedicated spot on the front page. As a reminder, here is the Dungeon Finder part of the 3.3.3 Notes.<br />
Dungeon Finder<br />
The Deserter debuff given to players who leave a dungeon prematurely when queuing via the Random Dungeon option has been increased to 30 minutes, up from 15 minutes. The cooldown for using the Random Dungeon option remains 15 minutes.<br />
The Random Dungeon cooldown is no longer displayed as a debuff. Instead, players will see the cooldown time remaining displayed in the Dungeon Finder window when Random Dungeon or Random Heroic Dungeon is selected from the pull-down.<br />
If a player in your party has the Deserter debuff, or is on cooldown from the Random Dungeon option, his or her character name will be displayed in the Dungeon Finder window listed as &quot;On Cooldown,&quot; preventing the group from queuing.<br />
Anyone in a dungeon party can now re-queue their group for a dungeon, as players will still be prompted whether or not to accept their chosen role.<br />
Players who use the Vote Kick option will now be prompted to provide a reason for kicking a party member. This reason will be presented to everyone in the party except for the person voted to be kicked.<br />
When joining as a group, more generous level requirements will be used instead of Random Dungeon level requirements so that players of different levels joining together will be eligible for a greater number of dungeons.<br />
Parties randomly created via the Dungeon Finder will always be arranged in the party interface from top to bottom in the following order: tank, healer, damage, damage, damage.<br />
If a random party is created via the Dungeon Finder and a player cannot roll Need on an item, a reason will now be provided.<br />
<br />
Cataclysm Tanking Cooldowns: Feedback<br />
We’re currently working on the tanking cooldowns for tanks in Cataclysm. We’re interested in feedback from the community on what makes cooldowns fun and useful. For example, what is the sweet spot in cooldown duration between an ability with such a short cooldown that you must mash it constantly versus an ability with such a long cooldown? Which current abilities are fun? Putting aside any rose-colored glasses, were there cooldowns in Burning Crusade or classic WoW that you miss in Lich King? What, in your minds, should the role be for talents and glyphs. For example, if glyphs shouldn’t reduce cooldowns, what can they do?<br />
<br />
We’re less interested for purposes of this specific discussion on class balance. Let’s try to keep the “who is overpowered?” discussions out of this thread. We want to focus on fun and useful with an eye towards the future.<br />
<br />
We intend to use this feedback to help make informed decisions when designing Cataclysm talents and abilities, but this is no guarantee that we will be implementing all suggestions or any particular suggestions from this thread. This is merely one of many tools that we plan to use for making the best possible decisions about continuing development.<br />
<br />
Thank you for your feedback. <br />

Theorycrafting / Spreedshets and class balance<br />
Spreadsheets and simulations are awesome and some of them have become quite sophisticated. There are still plenty of situations where actual players can't get anywhere close to those theoretical maximums. Now there are other situations where really exceptional players can bump up against those predicted numbers. For most players, their potential dps (in game) is a lot more relevant than what the spreadsheet says their potential dps could be.<br />
<br />
As an example, imagine that Survival required a really punishing shot rotation. Very good players (the kind that get insane actions per second on Starcraft maybe) might eek 14,000 dps out of that rotation. Mere mortals might only get 9000 dps though. On the other hand, imagine Marks could pump out 10,000 dps for almost any level of player. If you're going by the spreadsheets alone, you'd be dumb not to play Survival. Going by your logs, you'd be dump not to play Marks (unless you're in the 1% bracket). You could come up with similar examples for one spec only beating the other with best possible gear, or one spec only beating the other on fights with no movement. And so on. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/23767539635-bm-hunters-still-need-help.html))<br />
<br />
Survavibility as a DPS<br />
Yeah, this is exactly what I was referring to. Survival does matter in terms of being able to beat the boss, and I think we would be in a better place if more dps players took some responsibility for survival instead of assuming the design was that they focus solely on dps and blame the game (or the healers) when they die. That doesn't have to mean socketing blue Stamina gems in every piece of armor. It could mean &quot;Hey, maybe I can afford the 2 talent points for this survivability talent. That drops by maximum dps by 6%, but I'll do more damage alive than dead.&quot; (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/23767539635-bm-hunters-still-need-help.html))<br />
<br />
Classes homogenization and tanking niches<br />
We try and prevent homogenization among classes when we can. It's actually very important to us and obviously more important to us than many players who would be satisfied with us just smearing critical abilities across all of the tank classes.<br />
<br />
Having said that, we don't think well-defined tank niches are very good for the game. We've even backed off of well-defined healing niches and we'll continue to do so even more in Cataclysm. It comes down to a numbers problem. In a 5-player dungeon you get one tank. If the dungeon happens to be an AE tanking dungeon (Shattered Halls comes to mind) then groups want a paladin and not another tank. Likewise if we positioned DKs as the magic tank, they'd be underpowered on any dungeon without a lot of magic damage. Now maybe that's okay for a 5-player run, but it gets a lot trickier when you're talking about a 10-player raid with 2 tanks. When you're up against the most challenging content, you'd likely want to swap out for the best tank for the encounter, which means keeping a stable of 4 tanking classes ready to come in at a moment's notice. Some amount of swapping is hard to discourage, but we definitely don't want to design dungeons around the expectation that your paladin tank doesn't mind sitting out on the single target fights just to shine on the AE ones. She'll miss out on a lot of badges for one. :(<br />
<br />
It is definitely a challenge to keep classes feeling unique while giving players enough flexibility that they don't feel like they constantly have to ask their friends to reroll and / or recruit the missing puzzle pieces into their social circle. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/23767641552-an-appeal-to-ghostcrawler.html))<br />
<br />
&quot;Perfect&quot; DPS balance<br />
<br />
That's not actually a goal, or a realistic one anyway. I drop that 1% number a lot because it seems sometimes that's what the expectation is. The goal is that you should be able to play what you want and still be able to raid (and ideally PvP, but we're a lot farther from that). We've always said that taking on the most challenging content is going to take away some of your flexibility, and for the most part, players capable of beating that content are okay with that level of min / maxing. In fact, they kind of enjoy it.<br />
<br />
There's just no realistic way to have every dps spec in the game anywhere close to 1% of each other given how different the encounters and gear are, not to mention player skill. We'll continue to get as close as we can and will keep looking at specs that are just not taken seriously for raiding. I understand that may be a subjective call, just as the interpretation of &quot;viable&quot; is somewhat subjective. We determine it by looking at who is actually brought to raids as well as what their dps is when they do so.

Beast Mastery in 3.3.3<br />
So what are you saying about those players who estimate BM will be very close to Survival with the changes? Are they wrong? If so, talk to them instead. We don't really expect the community to come to a consensus on anything, but on the other hand, when some players are saying &quot;they're close&quot; and some players are saying &quot;they're not&quot; then more than likely, someone is wrong. :)<br />
<br />
Again, if you really like BM, you should be able to raid as BM with this change. Your raid leader may ask you to respec for the hardest Icecrown fights, but if you're on those fights, then you're probably used to being asked to make specific changes in order to maximize even the most marginal efficiency gains. At that point &quot;close enough&quot; might not be enough. At that point swapping for a 1% dps gain might be worth it. We're not going to get every class within 1% of each other in every situation, and players on that content know that.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, if you've been wiping on normal Festergut for the last four weeks then I can almost promise you that swapping from BM to MM is not what's going to suddenly buy you success. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/23767539635-bm-hunters-still-need-help.html))<br />
<br />
Ferocious Inspiration in 3.3.3<br />
In 3.3.2, Ferocious Inspiration rank 3 says: When your pet scores a critical hit, all party and raid members have all damage increased by 3% for 10 sec. In addition, increases the damage dealt by Arcane Shot by 9%.<br />
<br />
In 3.3.3, Ferocious Inspiration rank 3 says: All party and raid members have all damage increased by 3% within 100 yards of your pet. In addition, increases the damage dealt by Arcane Shot and Steady Shot by 9%. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/23767539635-bm-hunters-still-need-help.html))<br />
<br />
Theorycrafting hunter specs in 3.3.3<br />
Using something like Shandara's dps spreadsheets in 3.3.3, yields something like 15,000 for Marks, and 13,500 for Survival and BM. BM may be slightly below, but it's not by much, and given that this is a spreadsheet and not a raid parse, I think it's safe to assume that's within the human margin for error.<br />
<br />
There was a recent interview with two of Paragon's hunters in which they offered that they thought BM and SV were close and MM was maybe 1500 ahead in best gear. That's pretty consistent with the numbers I pulled out of the air above.<br />
<br />
If you think sources like that are in error, feel free to bring that up. But you kinda need to do so before saying &quot;every spreadsheet model&quot; etc. point to a massive disparity. (Assuming what you're arguing about here was my saying BM and SV are close.)<br />
<br />
Ideally all three numbers are 15,000 and that's a good if probably unrealistic goal to shoot for. In the mean time, BM should be close enough to Survival that you can raid with it, given that there are plenty of Survival hunters raiding today. If you don't get anywhere near 15,000 dps today (and current hunters are closer to 11 to 12K as highest dps in Icecrown), then the delta is likely to be even smaller, perhaps below 1K.

Arcane Mage too easy?<br />
Players like to wave this banner, but it's just not true. If all you do is look at their damage logs, yes, a lot of damage comes from Arcane Blast and Arcane Missiles. Does that mean any Arcane mage can faceroll his way to 12,000 dps? Hardly. The good mages have a lot of things to manage in the way of mana and cooldowns.<br />
<br />
&quot;Requires skill&quot; does not mean 20 sources of damage. It can also mean you have to juggle a lot to maximize the damage from 2 sources. That is the design of the mage in a nuthsell: a dominant nuke with a lot of infrastructure to prop up that nuke.<br />
<br />

Using Seal of Command as Protection Paladin<br />
I'm not sure the answer is just to prevent Prot from using Seal of Command. We like sub-speccing to some extent. I think part of the problem is the way HoR and SoC interact, but that doesn't mean the solution has to be one of them dies in a fire.

Realm Championships and the future of WoW TCG<br />
I'm not sure why I missed this post yesterday, but here is some reconforting news for TCG players. It looks like the Blazing Hippogryph and Wooly White Rhino (see Patch 3.3.3 Mounts (http://www.mmo-champion.com/news-2/3-3-3-mounts-battlecry-mosaic-blue-posts/) will stay in the game as TCG rewards introduced with the next expansion. More information soon, I guess. <br />
We wanted to take a minute and provide an update on the current status of this game. We want to reassure players that the TCG will continue, and look forward to releasing the Wrathgate and Icecrown expansions this spring and summer. The new plans are being finalized and there should be a full announcement by this weekend.<br />
<br />
Realm Championships will still take place in North America this weekend. All prizes will be awarded as announced at the event including iPods and Loot cards. Winners that receive a travel award will receive their information in approximately four to six weeks. Unfortunately, the trophies will not be ready for the event.<br />
<br />
These events will run according to the current World of Warcraft TCG and Miniatures tournament policies, and the current suspended player list will be enforced.<br />
<br />
We know it's been a chaotic few weeks, so just hang in there for a few more days.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i was hoping that with 3.3.3 i could auto kick ppl that join a random and auto afk<br />
<br />
im very anoyed that they didnt change it<br />
<br />
the only thing i wish they'd give us now is the ability to start a random if a dps declines as a dps quing its another 15 min wait sometimes if a dps declined all heroics are 4 manable now except the icc heroics....<br />
<br />
also i hope that if u do get kicked u get told why u get kicked when u leave the grp coz id be very anoying for ppl that do wat there suposed to be doing to be kicked for no reason and i dosent help the played being kicked if they dont know why there being kicked<br />
<br />
also i hope this stops ppl from being kicked from fos hc coz some noob wants NES all for him/her self.<br />

The Spellflingers have a 10 second cast on their Shadow thingy. You have a 6 second cooldown. Interrupt the first Spellflinger and 6 seconds later the second! <br />
Truth is, you do have to put in a tiny bit of effort to make this work, but that'll stop you from complaining that the game is too easy.</div></div><hr />

There are a lot of things that go into maximizing arcane damage. Keeping Slow up on a boss, for starters, is very useful if you're specced into that for extra damage. With the tier 10 4-set, you're probably going to use Mirror Image to maximize your damage, and you will also probably use the arcane missiles proc from the 2 set bonus to get a little haste. Using FF bolts doesn't hurt, if you're in a position to stand still for a second, because you can put a debuff on the enemy (You can get away with this on a boss like Lady Deathwhisper, especially if you're on the mana shield and not the adds). If you just stood in one spot and spammed Arcane Blast the whole fight, its very likely you will just run out of mana, and have to Evocate or something, which can be terrible if you're fighting a boss where you have to move a lot. (Yeah, just try to finish your Evocate on Marrowgar when a coldflame path is headed for you) There are of course a lot of nice buttons you will be pushing other than Arcane Blast at relevant times, like Presence of Mind, Icy Veins, and Arcane Power, any trinkets you might have, etc. Also, having a mana shield up for damage absorption/ spellpower increase (Incanter's Absorption) can help - especially in a fight like Festergut, where there is a lot of raid damage.

After a second to think, I imagine this will be similar to VH where you talk, and the action essentially begins in about fifteen seconds. Not everyone is terribly patient, unfortunately, especially when non-tanks can begin the action without dooming themselves. Hopefully this teleports everyone or enough time is given after the first teleport before waves spawned.<br />
<br />
Glad to see CoS probably becoming desirable again, especially if Arthas simply teleports (no more sitting at the town hall for two minutes randomly) and begins running between spawns. Maybe finally get the dungeon down below the fifteen minute mark. CoS somehow went from being the place to hit for emblems, alongside VH, to being a boring, long, less worthwhile instance in the spawn of Randoms. When you can do Gundrak in 10 minutes for the same amount of emblems...you get a tad jaded, I suppose.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No other class has cooldowns as important as an Arcane Mage. Very few classes have such a finite resource as an Arcane Mage in the sense that an Evocation that is interupted forces a 2 min oom mage. Avoidable sure, but it has to be managed in a way that a warlock, hunter or sp doesn't have to worry about managing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It really are only two buttons I mash to nuke, everything else (4-5 buttons more) are just cooldowns, like every other class has.<br />
<br />
<br />
There are a lot of things that go into maximizing arcane damage. Keeping Slow up on a boss, for starters, is very useful if you're specced into that for extra damage.<br />
<br />
There is no really sense with keeping it on the boss, since every tank uses an ability which procs TtW.<br />
<br />
<br />
With the tier 10 4-set, you're probably going to use Mirror Image to maximize your damage, and you will also probably use the arcane missiles proc from the 2 set bonus to get a little haste.<br />
Nothing wrong with using the Mirror Images, but the 2pc t10 bonus doesn't make us use the proc, since it should be used anyway.<br />
<br />
<br />
Using FF bolts doesn't hurt, if you're in a position to stand still for a second, because you can put a debuff on the enemy (You can get away with this on a boss like Lady Deathwhisper, especially if you're on the mana shield and not the adds).<br />
<br />
A debuff that makes a whooping 120 dmg over 12 second - it would be more of a dmg increase, if you would be in the midst of the second arcane blast instead of casting FFB.<br />
<br />
<br />
If you just stood in one spot and spammed Arcane Blast the whole fight, its very likely you will just run out of mana, and have to Evocate or something, which can be terrible if you're fighting a boss where you have to move a lot.<br />
<br />
No mage should just nuke a boss down with arcane blast alone, especially not if you know, you're going oom. Just fish for procs and only nuke, if you are sure that you can get the mana back<br />
<br />
<br />
(Yeah, just try to finish your Evocate on Marrowgar when a coldflame path is headed for you)<br />
<br />
I never had problems evocating in fights like this, just only use evocation, if you are sure it won't be interrupted.<br />
<br />
<br />
There are of course a lot of nice buttons you will be pushing other than Arcane Blast at relevant times, like Presence of Mind, Icy Veins, and Arcane Power, any trinkets you might have, etc.<br />
<br />
As stated above: Just like every other class. But managing your mana-gaining cooldowns (evo and gem) is really a bit harder than for other classes.<br />
<br />
Also, having a mana shield up for damage absorption/ spellpower increase (Incanter's Absorption) can help - especially in a fight like Festergut, where there is a lot of raid damage.<br />
<br />
That will run you oom really fast in most of the fights, especially on fights with a lot of raid dmg.<br />
<br />
<br />
And of course, there's always killing trash with Blizzard... you know... just 'cause. On the other hand, I miss playing a fire mage...<br />
<br />
Nothing wrong with this ;)<br />

Stop slacking. You have a 6 second cooldown interrupt, and their cast is 6 seconds, meaning that you can interrupt every single cast they do. And don't tell me you don't have the time for it, it's off the GCD. <br />

If you piss me off, and I can't ignore you, I'll just AFK till you kick me, or until the dungeon CD wears off. No way I'm getting a 30 min deserter because some un-ignorable &quot;dungeon guide&quot; decided to vehemently insult me for only doing three times the DPS needed for a dungeon, and not four.</div></div><hr />

It seems to be that if you are going to have the 30min deserter debuff then you HAVE to remove the 15 min wait to kick someone. Otherwise you can be held &quot;hostage&quot; (in a way) by someone who AFK's or is a jerk or whatever. <br />
<br />
I mean say Bob is a problem and everyone would like to kick Bob and oddly enough bob has shown his true colors 4 mins into the instance. Well you're stuck with bob unless you wanna say EFF'IT and drop out of the group and wait 11 mins OH BUT WAIT you can't cause now you have to wait 26 more mins. <br />
<br />
I don't think there's anything wrong with the deserter buff now that wouldn't also be ok with removal of the 15 min wait to kick people. I'm not sure why blizzard is hell bent on forcing you to stay in a group longer that isn't working for whatever reason and penalizing you more (than they currently are) if you don't.<br />
<br />
I also realize that just cause they don't have it on the PTR right now doesn't mean that the 15 mins wait thing is staying in. But it's not on there right now so we have to kind of treat it like it doesn't exsist yet.</div></div><hr />

These days Oculus is one of the best dungeons to get. It can be done in about 10-15 minutes with a decent group. Gives 2 extra badges, and a chance at the blue drake. I don't see why people still leave the group, maybe too many bad runs.<br />

I just know most of the time people are going to put &quot;sfkjasofdj&quot; or &quot;f&quot; or something that is in no way indicative of a reason, let alone a good reason, to kick. <br />
<br />
How many reasons would some really have to kick a player? Perhaps they should just provide us with a drop-down menu instead, with several options like; &quot;'Player' is not doing enough DPS/Damage&quot;, &quot;'Player' is being rude or abusive&quot;, &quot;'Player is AFK&quot;, &quot;'Player is not paying enough attention&quot;, &quot;'Player is a Gnome&quot;. Stuff like that.<br />
<br />
Also, if the &quot;Vote to Kick&quot; option is still in place, it needs to have it's time reduced to at least half (5 minutes sounds good). Just last night I was having many issues zoning into HoS, when I finally got in, there was a single DPS left who, when asked where everyone was, said that I was just standing there for 10 minutes so everyone left already. This was in no way fair to them but, they had to wait 15 minutes to kick me? So now 3 people had deserter buffs through no fault of their own. <br />
<br />
I do like the 30 minute deserter buff, though. Though, I've had issues beyond my control that force me to take a deserter buff, more often than not people are leaving just for the sake of leaving. Rather than use to the 'vote to kick' option like it's supposed to be, they'll leave and screw 4 other players over. This change will, overall, do more good than harm.</div></div><hr />

<br />
yeahhhhh, it requires insane skill to play an arcane mage...<br />
not that ANY warcraft class requires LOT of skill, but heck, gc's argument for arcane mage are so borderline &quot;trollish&quot; that if it was an user posting that it would have screamed &quot;troll&quot; from the top of thunderbluff...<br />
<br />
and yeah, omg so hard to use evocation effectively...<br />
right.. phase change? gotta move --&gt; blink+evo? just stop dps for a few secs when you're not under any particular proc//cd?<br />
clearly that's way too hard... it's like &quot;non bodede cabire, il mago argano è trobbo difficile&quot; (practically how in our guild we mimick some illiterate suburb mongrel that try to say in italian &quot;you can't understand, arcane mage is too difficult to play&quot;, in pure ghostcrawler style)...<br />
and yeah, so hard to use cd effectively... -.-&quot;&quot;<br />
i DO know a few mages that know to play effectively their class, but that being said, saying that the class is anywhere demanding to play is a BIG overstatement...</div></div><hr />

That being said, if you think any class in this game is &quot;hard to play&quot;, you're a really bad player. Every class is easy.

Well... to put it mildly. if you have a bunch of them at a time yer doing it wrong. Yes. OK is an instance where you actually have to slow down and pick a group at a time. Doing that will get you through them in no time compared to a GOGOGOGOGOOOO-AOE-AOE-AOEEEE approach. Wait for the first pat to come to the stairs between the patrolling &quot;facehuggers&quot; Mark the flinger - charge and own. Mark the flinger in the group slightly to the right - above the stairs down - Charge and own. Wait for the pat to get to the closest point on path to the stairs and either cornerpull it or deathgrip it (or silence or whatever). Do NOT zerg in and pull both groups. Yes, it can be done but it is a really silly gamble. When the pat is down mark and kill the group in the middle of the room. Those are ALL the flingers you need to concern yerself with. Yeah, so it takes a few minutes to do them one pull at a time, but hey - no wipes. Saves a lot of time and frustration.<br />
<br />
But I guess that comes down to the old &quot;know your limits and adjust accordingly&quot;. Tanking well isn't about Zerging every instance in as few pulls as possible. Tanking well is about getting the party through the instance safe and sound!</div></div><hr />

[list] Players who use the Vote Kick option will now be prompted to provide a reason for kicking a party member. This reason will be presented to everyone in the party except for the person voted to be kicked.<br />
<br />
<br />
Really... I think the reason SHOULD be given to the kicked player aswell - IF and only if the vote passes. &quot;You have been removed from the party for 'Going AFK'&quot; If they get booted without being told why, how are they supposed to learn?<br />
<br />
Sure. Abuseteams (groups of 3 grouping together to harass and grief other players - kick before last boss - ToT to healer - ninjalooting etc. etc.) will prolly just put some nonsense in there, but if you kick someone for going AFK for 5 minutes he needs to know that that was why he got booted. Or because he is abusive in partychat. or because he simply aint pulling his weight worth a damn... Played with a rogue today who spent the first part of CoS skilling bows. He had mostly ICC gear and was pulling a smashing 200 DPS. Yeah. That warrants a kick by my standards.<br />
<br />
I have no beef with a fresh 80 in greens and blues doing less than 1k dps. But I expect everyone to at least try to get the job done.</div></div><hr />

i dont see why at all,espically with a warrior tank(spell reflect for 52k)and about 4 interupts. + they only hit for about 26k,and most tanks now these days are around 32k+. maybe you arent healnig enough :P(last line was for the lolz)</div></div><hr />

I guess that's what they mean. People like you who just leave the instance that have vital roles (i.e. Healing) leave everyone else with their thumbs up their butt's waiting for another healer with an ego that isn't quite as inflated as yours. This is the kinda stuff that makes me sick =/<br />

If there is a problem, just leaving the group doesn't solve anything, it promotes and nourishes said problem. Try stepping down from your high horse and lending a helping hand, you will most likely see positive results :)</div></div><hr />

Two roles in the party can make sure that they are heard. The tank and the healer. Noone listens to DPS :-P<br />
<br />
At the start of the instance - before the first pull just say &quot;Ok, hang on. This instance is best NOT to zerg. Pull the groups with spellflingers one group at a time.&quot; if the tank don't listen - then at least you tried. if the DPS pull a &quot;Go go go go&quot; and rush ahead just let 'em die.<br />
<br />
If they go &quot;Zomg - it's only a heroic DEAL with it&quot; tell them to heal themselves. You stop healing if they ninja a second group... School of hard knocks and high repairs.<br />
<br />
Start wth words. if words don't get through. Try with repairs. If that don't work, THEN at least you tried.</div></div><hr />

Arcane Mage too easy?<br />
Players like to wave this banner, but it's just not true. If all you do is look at their damage logs, yes, a lot of damage comes from Arcane Blast and Arcane Missiles. Does that mean any Arcane mage can faceroll his way to 12,000 dps? Hardly. The good mages have a lot of things to manage in the way of mana and cooldowns.<br />
<br />
<br />
yeahhhhh, it requires insane skill to play an arcane mage...<br />
not that ANY warcraft class requires LOT of skill, but heck, gc's argument for arcane mage are so borderline &quot;trollish&quot; that if it was an user posting that it would have screamed &quot;troll&quot; from the top of thunderbluff...<br />
<br />
and yeah, omg so hard to use evocation effectively...<br />
right.. phase change? gotta move --&gt; blink+evo? just stop dps for a few secs when you're not under any particular proc//cd?<br />
clearly that's way too hard... it's like &quot;non bodede cabire, il mago argano è trobbo difficile&quot; (practically how in our guild we mimick some illiterate suburb mongrel that try to say in italian &quot;you can't understand, arcane mage is too difficult to play&quot;, in pure ghostcrawler style)...<br />
and yeah, so hard to use cd effectively... -.-&quot;&quot;<br />
i DO know a few mages that know to play effectively their class, but that being said, saying that the class is anywhere demanding to play is a BIG overstatement...<br />
<br />
<br />
As far as DPS classes go I have played all specs of mage and lock in a competative raiding environment. Except for the short period of affliction 6-dot juggling or what ever in early WoTLK current day arcane is the one that requires the most thinking.<br />
<br />
Juggeling CDs doesnt just mean don't get your evocation interrupted (although it does mean that to) but stack all cds with internal cd procs without going past haste cap.<br />
<br />
You think there is 1 cd to care about? Reality for me:<br />
Black magic proc 35s icd<br />
Lightweave 45s icd<br />
Trinket 45s icd<br />
Arcane power 1min 24s cd<br />
Trinket 2min cd<br />
Icy Veins 2min 24s cd<br />
Mirror Images 3 min cd<br />
Berserking 3 min cd<br />
Pot once in the start and then once more<br />
Bloodlust once per boss<br />
<br />
Stacking more than 2 haste effects brings me past haste cap. Meaning no more than 2 at the same time out of BL, pot, IV or zerking.<br />
Using haste effects without having a damage effect is usually a bad idea. Meaning quick desicions of whether to wait for trinket/icds to pop IV or do it straight away or wait for MI etc etc.<br />
<br />
On top of that there is the mana management, which nowadays isnt really an issue I guess. A good mage knows when to drop down from AB4ABAM to AB24ABAM though ofc.<br />
<br />
Pve DPS might not be &quot;hard&quot;. There is genereally some part of the fight that requires you to not stand in things though. What you do when moving is what defines a good ranged dps. The last part goes of course for all classes, arcane mages do have a stack to worry about though, making it more thought intensive than say a lock.<br />
<br />
In short, either all ranged dps classes are &quot;lulz ez&quot; and there is no need to troll arcane mages specifically, but rather you should swap to another game... OR! All ranged classes are about equally hard to play and there is still no need to troll arcane mages specifically.</div></div><hr />

Say wooot? XD<br />
Aff lock nowdays are kinda easy to play, we've got no cd or whatsoever.. but comparing to arc mage.. that's a bit insulting :)<br />
but that's going ot...<br />
as i said i DO know of skilled players using arc mages, but pretty please... don't go all &quot;amg cooldown timing is so hard&quot; because if the cooldown you reported are correct: <br />
Black magic proc 35s icd --&gt; you can't control it, you just swap weapon and hope for a proc asap<br />
Lightweave 45s icd --&gt; you can't exactly control it, you just know that after 45 sec you could get the buff.. but it can be 1-2-5 or even 10 seconds..<br />
Trinket 45s icd --&gt; you can't exactly control it, you just know that after 45 sec you could get the buff.. but it can be 1-2-5 or even 10 seconds..<br />
Arcane power 1min 24s cd --&gt; this you can control<br />
Trinket 2min cd --&gt; this you can control but whilst i'm not too much into mage's exact mechanics, i DO doubt that any on-use trinkets overshadow your proc trinkets... so you're considering cd something that's sub-par and just filling your slot while you wait for a decent pair of trinkets (say dfo+ heroic muradin? dfo+heroic reign?)<br />
Icy Veins 2min 24s cd --&gt; this you can control<br />
Mirror Images 3 min cd --&gt; this you can control BUT given the lenght of the cooldown, save for a few encounter you can pop this out say 1 times, max 2 if you pop it straight at the beginning.. yeah it requires greaaat management indeed....<br />
Berserking 3 min cd --&gt; this you can coordinate with your raid as other classes do..<br />
Pot once in the start and then once more --&gt; this you can coordinate with other factor as other classes do..<br />
<br />
so really cut me some slack.. <br />
you can juggle YOUR cooldown, namely 2 to use more then once and a third (mirror image) to use just once, the other stuff are just random proc... namely you can try to juggle one of the first two with some proc, but that's just it...<br />
awesome, then you've got something to watch while you just press<br />
11112? man that's really harsh work for you :|</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shamuskie</div><div class="date">2010-03-20, 05:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I honestly agree about the whole kicking useless people in heroics who are either not geared enough to do respectable dps/heals/tanking and contribute to the group. Having to wait 15 minutes and wipe countless times is just a total pain in the ass. I've played every role from tanking to healing to dps and it sucks in every way to have to deal with that. If you can't play up to par in a heroic, howtf are you gonna raid effectively? There's a limit to how much you can be carried, and if you wanna avoid that, work on learning your class. Ask someone that you see does well with their class and try to follow some of their pointers rather than calling them an elitest or an arrogant jerk. Odds are, they have every right to be cuz they can play their class.<br />
<br />
In terms of this lulz about arcane mages being easy, that's a lie, the post a little ways up proves that. However, you don't have more the manage than an affliction warlock or boomkin so don't go there, your rotation isn't THAT unreasonable. The key to playing a ranged well (which goes with every class when it comes to raiding) is staying the fuck out of shit that'll kill you. Raiding 101: don't stand in fire or other aoe shit.</div></div><hr />

You've obviously never seriously played an arcane mage end game. The fact that CDs are in our control makes it easy? What? The point the guy is making is that we're not &quot;lul 2 butons ur ez&quot;. Mirror images are often used twice in a fight, if the raid is popping hero at the end that is. But if you know theyre using hero sooner in the fight but not right away, you save your cds for it. You always want to match up as many cds as you can in a fight, this means making decisions mid fight (unless you got the fight planned out pre-hand which is the best way to go) on whether to pop icy veins and arcane power or wait for mirrors to come off cd...ect.<br />
<br />
Level a mage and press 11112 over and over, please, that would be very amusing to watch.<br />
<br />
All in all, this game in general isnt &quot;OMG SO HARD&quot;, but it's insulting to mages to say we can play with a nintendo controller when we put so much thought behind each encounter to maximize our dps.</div></div><hr />

Regarding the vote kick 'reason', all i can say is bleh. There's no need for it IMO. Everyone realizes when someone is baddie I guess, especially the tank or healer, so why'd you bother to write a relevant reason, just plain kick him.<br />

Yeah, we sometimes have to add another 1, or maybe two or three!<br />
On a serious note: The rotation itself is very far away from being hard, but maximizing your dmg output without going oom is the thing, that makes this rotation fun.<br />

<br />
This, every hunter has just as many cooldowns as arcane and proof that arcane is easy<br />
<br />
I make an arcane mage on the ptr (during 3.2.2, so quite a bit ago, meaning i'm in full 245 gear.), I do a spec based on my common sense what would be good for a caster, i gem based on what i've seen other mages gem, i take five minutes to look at spells. I place cooldowns and two main spells on bars, pull 5.2k dps unbuffed on my first try, when I try other classes I had never played, I do 3-4k dps. Thats more proof that arcane mages are easy, and as for cooldowns you macro them together to put all your main dps cooldowns together to go off at the same time, do that with my hunter and its no problem. Arcane mages are easy, thats like saying BM hunters arent easy (dont say they are hard when i played bm its this, steady steady steady arcane steady steady steady arcane, and you can mess up and only lose lik 10 dps since your pet does 50% of your damage.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, this is exactly what I was referring to. Survival does matter in terms of being able to beat the boss, and I think we would be in a better place if more dps players took some responsibility for survival instead of assuming the design was that they focus solely on dps and blame the game (or the healers) when they die. That doesn't have to mean socketing blue Stamina gems in every piece of armor. It could mean &quot;Hey, maybe I can afford the 2 talent points for this survivability talent. That drops by maximum dps by 6%, but I'll do more damage alive than dead.&quot; (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/23767539635-bm-hunters-still-need-help.html))<br />
<br />
That is one of the reasons, why i like the Mimiron encounter so much. If a dps dies, it's in a lot of cases the fault of the player himself, and no healer can pick up the slack. In this fight you can very easy tell the good from the bad.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Black magic - 35s ICD autoproc<br />
DFO - 45s ICD ramping autoproc<br />
Exalted AD ring - 1m ICD autoproc<br />
Eng gloves - 1m manual CD<br />
AP - 1.4m manual CD<br />
PoM - 1.4m manual CD (cannot be used with AP)<br />
Icy Veins - 2.4m manual CD<br />
Evo - 2m CD, best to use at the very last split second of a haste proc or CD, and/or during dps downtime, and cannot be used when any boss ability requiring movement is off cooldown soon<br />
Mirror Images - 3m huge CD w/ 4pT10<br />
<br />
Okay, stack as many of these buffs together as often as possible in a 5 minute window, keeping heroism timing for the given fight in mind... and since 3 of the procs are haste, make sure you never go below 1s GCD w/ your 1200 passive gear haste... go!<br />
<br />
Yes, arcane's base rotation is two buttons, but when you weave arcane missiles in with arcane blasts isn't as cut and dried as people who don't play the spec make it out to be (if you always use the proc at 2 blasts or keep blasting 12 times when a proc never shows up, you're doing it wrong; you pretty much have to change your rotation based on mana cooldowns and current amount, plus the remaining length of the fight), and there are more cooldowns (with vastly varied wait times) which require perfect stacking (9, above) for maximum dps than any other class I've played or researched. It's not cat dps, but it's no less complex to play at maximum skill with a single target than a dot class like a shadow priest. The complexity just isn't in the straight-up rotation/maintenance, but in the cooldown timings instead. And those saying ICD's don't count as increased difficulty because you don't control them directly, they're MORE difficult, not less, because if you don't stack AP w/ the last 15 seconds of a DFO proc, you're losing ridiculous amounts of dps.<br />
<br />
And yeah, if you time the cooldowns wrong, you probably still do higher dps than most. But that doesn't make arcane easy, it just means it does more dps than it should at low skill levels. It'll still do 15-20% more dps if you don't pretend it's easy mode and learn how to play it correctly.</div></div><hr />

At some point it was mentioned in a blue post that the 15 minute limit before you can kick someone was gone, but it doesn't seem to be the case in the current build of the PTR. We will have to wait and see how it works on the live servers.<br />
As I understood it, it was just saying that there is no longer 15 minute CD before you can kick ANOTHER player. Now if you kick one player there is a time (probably 15 minutes) you can't kick another player.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, this is exactly what I was referring to. Survival does matter in terms of being able to beat the boss, and I think we would be in a better place if more dps players took some responsibility for survival instead of assuming the design was that they focus solely on dps and blame the game (or the healers) when they die. That doesn't have to mean socketing blue Stamina gems in every piece of armor. It could mean &quot;Hey, maybe I can afford the 2 talent points for this survivability talent. That drops by maximum dps by 6%, but I'll do more damage alive than dead.&quot; (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/23767539635-bm-hunters-still-need-help.html))<br />
<br />
That is one of the reasons, why i like the Mimiron encounter so much. If a dps dies, it's in a lot of cases the fault of the player himself, and no healer can pick up the slack. In this fight you can very easy tell the good from the bad.<br />
<br />
Mimiron's by far my favorite fight because of that. Roots out the baddies</div></div><hr />

Most tanks are so geared now earth shield can keep them up while I stand watching for the spellflinger cast bar. Cleansing totem can handle the poisons if any hit anyone. If the tank happens to pull 2 spellflingers, I focus on one to interrupt. I then make sure to time my heals properly so I hit the tank with a healing wave when the second spellflinger hits the tank. If I can't time properly, I just spam heal while interrupting until one spellflinger is dead, then I go to interrupting the other. Sometimes I get lucky and the DPS kill the spellflingers first. Sometimes I don't. Since I've started to properly time my heals and interrupt when I'm not healing, I have not wiped in OK from spellflingers.<br />
<br />
On my holy paladin, I use holy wrath on the spellflingers and stun them so I get at least 2 casts interrupted. Since she's a blood elf, I also arcane torrent. On my priest, I just bite the bullet, pray the DPS know who to kill first, and just spam heal the tank when the spellflinger's cast is about to go off.<br />
<br />
Unlike most instances, the opening part to OK actually requires the healer to be awake. I actually enjoy it because I can do something other than heal and feel useful for a short bit. So many short change the healer and rarely say thank you for the heals.<br />
<br />
It's quite a shame that so many remember how hard a heroic was back in November-December of 2008, and now that they vastly outgear it, they refuse to go back despite the fact that you can do the entire instance auto attacking/wanding now. Only ones that actually require you to do anything would be ToC5 and the ICC 5-mans. OK's one of the easiest out there. You can get 2-5 badges in about 10-30 minutes, too. I'd rather do the instance than sit around with a debuff for 15-30 minutes. By the time your debuff wore off, I'm out of the instance already and onto the next one. I've got 7 80s, too. Time is not something I can really waste if I want to do all 7 in one day. Since 3 are healers, 3 are DPS, and 1 is a tank, I'm in for some long queue times if I ditch instances.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yesterday I was in a group with some idiot who refused to zone into the instance. He didn't see the point in doing the actual instance. He wanted us to clear the place, so he could just show up for the last boss and claim his two frost badges. So he stayed outside the instance, doing his Argent Tournament dailies. And we couldn't kick him because of the timer.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Regarding the vote kick 'reason', all i can say is bleh. There's no need for it IMO. Everyone realizes when someone is baddie I guess, especially the tank or healer, so why'd you bother to write a relevant reason, just plain kick him.<br />
<br />
<br />
It's being implemented to prevent people from being unjustly kicked, not the other way around. It has been my experience that when a vote to kick prompt pops up, everyone will usually just click yes. And then people will ask, &quot;Hey, why'd we kick that guy?&quot;<br />
<br />
I've been the victim of it myself. I was healing Pit of Saron a few days ago. We had just finished the second boss, when I was kicked. I admit I was a bit undergeared for the place, but skill more than made up for that. Not only had no one died so far, no one ever got below 50% health. Considering that the only thing I needed from the place dropped off the last boss, I was pretty pissed.<br />
<br />
Another change they need to make: move the position of the 'vote to kick' option on the character frame. Right now it is right beside the 'inspect player' option, making it pretty easy to accidentally initiate a vote to kick when all you really want to do was inspect them.</div></div><hr />

I used to do the same on my priest until I had that watershed moment one day where I remembered I had Shackle Undead. It interrupts the spellflinger's casts just fine.

You are right. But you are impossible to understand because you can't bother to capitalize or use punctuation. I normally don't rag on people for spelling or grammar, but you are so right. As a holy paladin, I've lost many a dps/tank or even wiped on those first few pulls. I even got ridiculed by an aggro pulling DPS warrior because he died to them, but I'm fairly confident he got a 3 day break for saying what he did, all based on a few mobs a lot of people don't understand.</div></div><hr />

I'm sorry, but I just had to come out of lurk mode and finally register when I read this. First, what part of him playing a Mage for the first time did you not get? Second, what part of unbuffed is hard to understand? 5.2k DPS unbuffed, as a first timer, isn't that bad considering that you yourself just said he was only 4-5k DPS off the max, 2-3k+ of that being mainly from raid buffs, potions, food buff, flask, and heroism. So he was only in reality only 1-2k DPS from the max on his first time playing an Arcane Mage? Sounds easy to me...<br />
<br />
Also, to all the butthurt Mages, you aren't the only class with multiple procs to watch in order to get the most up at once. Hell, even lolret has a ton of procs to watch, ICC ring proc, Berserker enchant, libram stacks, Greatness card procs maybe, Art of War, a useable trinket, Avenging Wrath, etc. Without even really trying, I listed at least 5 things, and all of them need to be watched to get the most up at once. Sorry, but your &quot;But we gotta watch CDs and procs&quot; argument is horribly flawed because you are FAR from being the only class to have to worry about those things.<br />

Arcane mages are pretty easy to get started as but there is still that extra damage that good players can squeeze in. At the highest level, I don't think it's that much easier than the other specs. It's just that for terrible dps, arcane mage is the easiest to do reasonably well in.<br />

As for cd stacking, ICC geared mages who geared properly are pushing against the haste cap already. Using icy veins and potion of speed at the same time while bloodlusted may not provide the desired results.</div></div><hr />
