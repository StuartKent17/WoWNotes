I didn't report the Arena Matchmaking System FAQ on the front page yesterday, but Kalgan made a very interesting reply here. Below are the rating requirements for Season 6 gear, also note that a new Archavon boss will be added. There isn't any ETA for Season 6 for the moment, most likely patch 3.1.0 release date + a few weeks/months.

Arena Matchmaking System FAQ (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/11/14910422788-arena-matchmaking-system-faq.html)<br />
<br />
There's still plenty of room for some items to be pretty hard to get without causing most players to be left out of good gear. As I mentioned earlier, with the start of the next season we expect new teams and personal ratings to start much lower than they have before (not 1500). That way, everyone's experience is to climb toward the rating they're successfully playing at. So, knowing that, here's what our current thinking is on rating requirements for season 6.<br />
<br />
Disclaimer: all of this is subject to change!<br />
<br />
Other notes/caveats:<br />
Items with no rating listed would have no rating requirement<br />
It won't be quite as easy to get deadly items via emblems of conquest as hateful items currently are via emblems of valor<br />
The new Archavon boss (a new boss located in another wing of the Vault of Archavon), will have slightly different drops than the current Archavon (he can drop Furious Gloves/Legs, or any possible random honor item in addition to tier 8 pve set items similar to Archavon's t7 pve set drops, but cannot drop the Furious Chest piece)<br />
Honor/Arena costs aren't listed but Hateful costs would be similar to current Savage, Deadly costs similar to current Hateful, and Furious costs would be similar to current Deadly<br />
You might note that the Furious weapon is still at a high requirement, 2k, the thinking being that most players are encouraged to get their weapon upgrade through pve, although hardcore arena competitors have an outlet to get an equivalent weapon through arenas (if you're hardcore enough for 2k, you can forego raiding for a weapon)<br />
Additional note, &quot;deadly trinket&quot; refers to the current battlemaster's trinkets, &quot;furious trinket&quot; refers to an upgraded medallion of the alliance/horde<br />

Boubouille should call out the mention of the Emblem of Conquest, as it's an implicit confirmation that they won't be adding new rewards for Emblems of Valor when a new tier releases; instead, the new tier will drop a newly named token which will have the new rewards. No more level 70 T6 from heroic badges. You have to raid a given tier to get loot equivalent to that tier.</div></div><hr />

if you read the text you would see that Kalgan states that teamratings will be much lower than 1500 at the start of season 6. This is to have people not feel crappy with a rating under 1500.</div></div><hr />

New tier of tokens from Ulduar? They did hint that there would be a new type for greater gear (ie. can't acquire tier 8-level stuff with tier 7 tokens). I'm just guessing here, though.</div></div><hr />

That's fine, I'd just like a confirmation on that. I've been hording Valor tokens up for new 3.1 gear, but if there isn't going to be any and we have to get new emblems in Ulduar I have a lot of tank gear I can buy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My question is.. if ur at lets say 1800 rating now, will u still be able to get to 1800 in S6? If they lower the rating only to &quot;please&quot; the 1300+ players, and not effect the MMR for 1800+ gear will be very easy to obtain.. but hey im not complaining :)</div></div><hr />

You dont need confirmation, its blatantly obvious that they like their current badge system so you cant go hording lower Ilevel tokens for higher Ilevel gear</div></div><hr />

If you are in the middle you have nothing to spend the points on anyway.<br />
<br />
Myself I'm only 1 drop away from having full deadly/hateful without ever being near that rating and I'm also honor capped with nothing I need from honor gear anymore. So unless you are 2k+ material or really enjoy doing arenas for it's own sake then what's the point in going there? It's already like that in this season and it now seems to be even more so for the next one. Same to some extent with BGs, no gear to have anymore but at least I enjoy to do them anyway from time to time.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sulika</div><div class="date">2009-02-06, 03:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If new teams will start from 1200, won't those people be @ 900 then?<br />
<br />
<br />
No, the rating you see on your char sheet is only used for allocating of arena points and determining the overall rankings. That number does not seem to be used at all in the matchmaking system. At all times your team rating will tend to move closer to the hidden rating.<br />
<br />
So if everyone started at 1500 then teams who should be at 1200 will gain little and lose a lot in games until they end up around the 1200 point. If they started at 900 then they will gain a lot and lose very little until they end up around the 1200 mark. The hidden rating in both cases would progress in exactly the same manner and as such matchmaking would work exactly as it does when you start at 1500.<br />
<br />
So presumably now when you make a new team your team rating and hidden rating both start at 1500. They could change it so that your team rating started at 0 and your hidden rating started at 1500 and from a matchmaking perspective things will work exactly as they do now. The only difference would be that a 1200 team would gain a lot of rating until they hit 1200 as opposed to now where they lose a lot of rating until they drop to 1200.<br />
<br />
One potential benefit however from starting teams at low ratings and having everyone gain is that it actually encourages even poor players to play more arena. Right now if you are a 1200 team the best thing you can do is make a new team and lose 10 games each week (assuming you just want arena points). You will drop to about 1400 rating but still be doing better than if you keep playing until your rating adjusts to your skill. If they change that however and start all ratings at 0 (or 500 or 900 or whatever) and your rating will be rising until you reach your skill level then that actually changes the system and low skilled teams are better off if they keep playing arena until their rating stabilizes around 1200 or wherever it belongs.<br />
<br />
In effect this solves the biggest problem with the current arena system. 1500 is the rating intended to represent an average level of skill. Presumably the average player is supposed to gain some rewards. However when everyone starts at that points the rewards have to be placed at 1600+ ratings, in effect the rewards are only available at a level that indicates an above average skill level to accomodate the fact that even really bad players can reset themselves to the average point. By making everyone start low and work up then average is a point you actually have to get to, presumably 50% of teams should make 1500 or higher but by having them start lower they can actually put rewards at that level without worrying that everyone can get them.<br />
<br />
Lastly, the hidden ratings gives one other benefit to Blizzard that nobody has mentioned. Since the rating is hidden they can change it in the background without any of us noticing anything. What this means is that they can re-normalize the hidden ratings at any point they want. So for example, as part of the weekly maintainance they can work out the average hidden rating and if it is 1450 on a week then they can just increase everyones hidden ratings by about 50 points each and the team ratings will adjust to match that level next week, similarly they can use this to adjust the average rating downwards if the average hidden rating ended up at 1500 or so. In effect this insulates the game from most of the &quot;but if all the poor players stop playing it will break arena&quot; issues that people bring up. It gives them a knob to tweak if they ever want to trend team ratings either up or down overall.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The big brother of the emblem of valor. I'm going to guess that emblems of valor will drop in 10 man Uludar (and like tier content) and then they will add items to the emblem of valor merchant. Emblems of Conquest will drop in 25 man Uludar (and like tier content) and a new merchant will be introduced.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard has announced multiple times that they want to make it completely possible to progress through raiding with out ever stepping foot in a 25 man, so I really do think that 213 items will drop in Uludar and tier 8 will be very similar to 7.5 with just a different bonus but then 8.5 will drop from 25 man and be better than 8.<br />
<br />
What I'm worried about is the chance that they might make the new VoA boss difficult. Because of the nature of getting to VoA it makes it very hard for a guild to actually put it on a raid schedule, so I'm really hoping that VoA 2.0 will still allow you to pick 25 random people and go clear it as long as you have class balance and the people aren't totally idiotic.</div></div><hr />

Boubouille should call out the mention of the Emblem of Conquest, as it's an implicit confirmation that they won't be adding new rewards for Emblems of Valor when a new tier releases; instead, the new tier will drop a newly named token which will have the new rewards. No more level 70 T6 from heroic badges. You have to raid a given tier to get loot equivalent to that tier.<br />
<br />
<br />
You are reading WAY to much into it. What he is saying is that 25 man content will drop a different emblem in t8. That doesn't mean items won't be added to the Emblem of Valor merchant. It just means that those items won't be as powerful as the items in 25 man t8 content. They will probably be as powerful as 25 man t7 and t8 10 man though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They are adding another one that does exactly that, but as a big bad pvper I thought you already assumed you were better than everyone else. That means you should enjoy destroying people that gear from VoA 2.0 and think they can pvp in arenas regardless what their gear level is.</div></div><hr />

If you are in the middle you have nothing to spend the points on anyway.<br />
<br />
Myself I'm only 1 drop away from having full deadly/hateful without ever being near that rating and I'm also honor capped with nothing I need from honor gear anymore. So unless you are 2k+ material or really enjoy doing arenas for it's own sake then what's the point in going there? It's already like that in this season and it now seems to be even more so for the next one. Same to some extent with BGs, no gear to have anymore but at least I enjoy to do them anyway from time to time.<br />
<br />
<br />
Add that to the fact that the best gear comes from BOTH pvp and pve now, but the best gear for pve comes from pve, and you suddenly see why fewer and fewer people worry about arenas. I personally hated arenas in TBC because the best gear really was coming from them, but in WotLK, I've never stepped foot in an arena nor do I intend to, and I could honestly care less about PvP in this game. If I wanted to play serious PvP I'd go play WAR.</div></div><hr />

You are assuming that VoA 2.0 will be easy. It might not be. You also are reading way to much into the &quot;Uludar will be harder than Naxx&quot; comment made by Blizzard. Naxx25 IS NOT HARD. All Uludar would have to have in order to be harder than Naxx is fights that require you to actually move and dps at the same time. Also, there is a reason there is a hard mode in all of Uludar to appease the hardcore raiders and its not because the place won't be casual friendly.</div></div><hr />

Kinda agree, but there is more to it than that. I wish I could PvP and have fun, but Arena isn't that, but I won't just switch MMO. No way. Starting all over, in another game entirely, is not something appealing at all for some people.</div></div><hr />

they didn't merely hint at it, they've been directly saying &quot;there will be separate tokens per tier&quot; the whole damn time, the only people thinking otherwise are the BC thinking scrubs that want to keep using their heroism tokens for their tier 8 equivalent items and just stand around going &quot;lalalalalala i can't wait for new items on the heroism vendor&quot; despite what is being said to the contrary the whole time.</div></div><hr />

/agree <br />
<br />
I think it's good that the less hard core players can still get some gear maybe, besides the chances aren't good that your class will even get gear, let alone the set you want.<br />
So I mean I'm no mathematician but let's see here 8 classes x (2 sets x 5 pieces of gear per set)<br />
8x 10 = 80 <br />
So I think, let's say you're going for a certain piece of gear pve hunter gloves for example<br />
your odds should be... 1/80 + 1/80 + 1/80... or in other words 3 chances to get a piece of gear that has a 1/80 chance of dropping<br />
or... 1/26.67 But that's not even factoring in if there are other people in the raid that need it too.<br />
<br />
So... let's say there are three of you and you all need it. 1/26.67 x 1/3 = oh snap look at that you're back up to 1/80.<br />
<br />
But like I said I'm no mathematician so I dont even know if m math is right I just think it is. Either way your chances of getting any gear are slim.</div></div><hr />

Blizz said that their current iLevel 200 and iLevel 213 items might have too much haste and/or armory penetration. Also some items might not have stats like strength. My thoughts are that the Ulduar gear no matter the item level will be better itemized for your character. I don't remember the exact post but I imagine someone on here with some time on their hands can find it.<br />
<br />
So even if you run Ulduar 10 man you may find some 213 level stuff that is better itemized than your current Naxx 25 stuff even though it has a different item level. There is always room to fill itemization holes too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
My own logic behind this is this: <br />
<br />
Wouldn't be surprised if Ulduar10 will be ilvl 213 (a tier up), with the end boss being ilvl 226 and Ulduar25 being ilvl 226 and the end boss being ilvl 239. Gives a smoother progression in zones. ea. being full Naxx25 gives you the readiness for Ulduar25. This to me seems really logical point of view. It would still fit with itemization, giving some Ulduar10 drops better stats then Naxx25. <br />
<br />
Current Heroic Epic and Naxx10/Sath10(without 2+ drakes) are ilvl 200. <br />
Malygos10, kelthuzad10, Naxx25, Sath25(without 2+ drakes), Ulduar10-endboss are ilvl 213.<br />
Malygos25, Kelthuzad25, Sath25+2D+, Ulduar10 End Boss, Ulduar25 are ilvl 226<br />
Ulduar25-endboss will be ilvl 239<br />
<br />
edit:<br />
I would be surprised if they kept the current ilvl, giving Ulduar25 the same ilvl as Naxx25... but I doubt it would happen.</div></div><hr />

Also, there is a reason there is a hard mode in all of Uludar to appease the hardcore raiders and its not because the place won't be casual friendly.<br />
<br />
Yup.<br />
Keep in mind, the reason VoA is easy is because it's TUNED easy.<br />
Adjust a few numbers here and there and you've actually got a Brutalus-style encounter; knock a minute or two off the enrage timer, boost his damage output a little and you're there. Ok so there's no meteor slash, but it still requires 2 tanks and does some nasty AoE. <br />
<br />
The reason Naxx is easy is because they removed most of the hardest bits, and tuned to easy the rest. Once, Grand Widow's Rain of Fire was something to stay out of, Maexxana's wall web was fatal, Sapphiron mostly REQUIRED Frost Res, and so forth. Now it's a joke.<br />
<br />
We've seen it before; the way to make the instance harder is to require people to move properly (Council, KJ). To require high enough DPS or be stuck there all night (Brut, M'uru). To require no-one to die or it's corpse-run time. (Archi) To have long encounters which aren't over in 3 minutes, before your healers even come close to OOM. <br />
<br />
They know how much DPS Naxx-farming raids are doing, how much healing they can expect on the tank, how hard the tank can be hit. They know how much HP tier 7 raiders have so they can easily design bosses on Najentus / Supremous level. That's where i'd expect the difficulty level to be, at least on the first few &quot;normal mode&quot; bosses. At least 1 boss doing HEAVY raid AoE damage, at least 1 boss involving not standing in fire; if people can't manage that they shouldn't be in there. I'm NOT expecting a BT clone, but i'd expect that's where the difficulty will start. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hard mode&quot; should be more like Bloodboil, RoS, Kalecgos, Archimonde, etc. Perhaps some impossible-with-current-gear hard-modes, that'll either eventually be nerfed or out-geared.<br />
<br />
<br />
/edit<br />
on-topic, as others have said, the item levels will start at KT/Malygos levels, and increase further in and for &quot;hard mode&quot;. How high the item level for the last boss on &quot;hard mode&quot; will be remains to be seen, 239 for normal probably, 252 for hard mode perhaps? There'll probably be a new level of badges for 25-man, while the 10-man will probably use the Naxx25 tokens, as they'll just end up duplicating half the items otherwise, and dalaran will be overrun by epic badge vendors. The new items available from tokens probably won't be higher than 226.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;Q: How good will the furious weapons be? Why would I want one if the PvE weapons are better?<br />
<br />
A: In the case of the current deadly gladiator weapons, we simply botched the ilvls since at the time of their design we didn't account properly for the fact that Kel'Thuzad weapons would be as accessible as they are. Had we anticipated this better, the KT weapons wouldn't have been a full tier ahead of pre-KT weapons, and the deadly weapons would have been equivalent in ilvl. We expect that the best season 6 pvp weapons obtainable will be equal in level/quality to the best Ulduar weapons, even if that means we need more than one tier of pvp weapon to do it (ie: a 1750 weapon and a 2200 weapon). Note: the whole trick here is reasonably balancing what percentage of players get raid weapons of X quality versus what percentage of arena players also get a weapon of X quality.&quot;<br />

The new items available from tokens probably won't be higher than 226.<br />
<br />
<br />
assuming weapon scaling continues the way it is, we'll be seeing 239 185 dps one handers (same as i.e. titansteel destroyer) and 252 200 dps one handers... which would frankly be such a crazy dps compared so certain scrubs... I mean come on, not even the KJ one handers had more dps than S2 2handers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ulduar will have two different types of badges. I am going to hope that they learned alot from the Sunwell debacle and won't allow players to save up their valor tokens now so they can buy the Ulduar 10 Tier gear from the vendor on the day of patch. (Tier 8 if you will; with Ulduar 25 being 8.5).<br />
<br />
<br />
you guys wanted differents sets, so you got em. and they pull off Functional very well. <br />
<br />
They really are not different sets when you look at it. It's 3 tiers of recoloured 'mehness'. It would be nice if they had a little more flare to the sets. Instead, they look like something I was farming from UBRS.</div></div><hr />

<br />
ulduar 10- 2 valor badges per boss , 2 epixx with a ilevel half a tier higher than baxx 25<br />
ulduar 25 -1 conquest and a full tier above naxx 25<br />
<br />
ulduar 10 is going to be harder than naxx 25 (ok i dont have that confirmed by blizz but come on its going to have to be!) if the gear isnt better than naxx 25 no ones going to bother.</div></div><hr />

Official confirmation that they want epics for everyone if you ask me.<br />
<br />
Bring on welfare legendaries.<br />
<br />
<br />
You've had 2+ years of confirmation of that. Srsly.<br />
<br />
Who cares about epics for everyone? The real problem is there isn't ANYTHING for only really good players anymore - there's no content designed to be very very difficult. As long as there's content for both it's cool, when it's just content for everyone it's bad.</div></div><hr />

I believe that the Ulduar 'hard-modes' are for that<br />
<br />

BTW how did this news post about arena became.. oh yeah, the badge part</div></div><hr />

I think it's good that the less hard core players can still get some gear maybe, besides the chances aren't good that your class will even get gear, let alone the set you want.<br />
So I mean I'm no mathematician but let's see here 8 classes x (2 sets x 5 pieces of gear per set)<br />
8x 10 = 80 <br />
So I think, let's say you're going for a certain piece of gear pve hunter gloves for example<br />
your odds should be... 1/80 + 1/80 + 1/80... or in other words 3 chances to get a piece of gear that has a 1/80 chance of dropping<br />
or... 1/26.67 But that's not even factoring in if there are other people in the raid that need it too.<br />
<br />
So... let's say there are three of you and you all need it. 1/26.67 x 1/3 = oh snap look at that you're back up to 1/80.<br />
<br />
But like I said I'm no mathematician so I dont even know if m math is right I just think it is. Either way your chances of getting any gear are slim.<br />
<br />
Sort of right. You are right that the chances aren't very high (clearly not 50%, etc).<br />
<br />
However, firstly, there's not a piece of gear for every single class in the game. Hunter gear can suit all hunter talent specs. Warrior gear is usually (in my experiences) for arms or fury (DPS), etc. Plus some of the &quot;lost protector&quot; (etc) badges apply to 3 different classes. So really the base probability you're working off is higher than you are suggesting.<br />
<br />
Then there's the whole thing that, in my case, I'm usually the only (or there's only 1 other) physical DPS warrior in a raid group, hence if warrior gear drops I have a 50% - 100% chance of getting that gear, etc.</div></div><hr />

Come on, do you expect balance, do you expect that all classes are equal...that's not realistic. I agree, rid of VOA due to the fact of free deadly gear (3/5) to noobs then they claim they can PVP by getting 3/5 deadly and run BG's to get hateful/deadly offset is considered arena experts. Sure, we want to help the casual, but NOT CARETAKE to them and give them a free ride. <br />
<br />
2k is easy due to the fact that PVE has set priority in how to gear up. I see full pve mages and hunters in arena and I am full 800 resil juggernaut and I hit them for crap or they have soo much outs that trying to hit them is impossible. While they kite the shit out of me, I get hit for the OP ES and yes, still OP barrage. Yet, barrage isn't as bad as before, so I am less QQ'ing on that, lol. Obtaining PVP gear is a joke and a waste, 3v3 tourney will be a joke that all I see will be RMP, DK/hunter/pali, or DK/Pali/War teams. You might squeeze some boom/mage/shamman teams or boom/lock/shamman teams, but it's the same ole same ole on the top.</div></div><hr />

Wow. You honestly could not be any more of a moron.<br />
Because colors are serious business, right? The color of something denotes how valuable and &quot;good&quot; it is, right?<br />
Oh wait. No, not it doesn't. At all.<br />
It's called item level you worthless bastard. Go complain some more about something you know nothing about.<br />
They do this for a reason, and it's a good reason which actually makes sense if you get your finger out of your ass for 10 seconds to read something. <br />
If something is epic, it's &gt;all right? Wrong. Item level. So who the hell cares if someone gets a Claymore of Ancient Power (epic, and terible), if YOU have a BoH (epic, and amazing).<br />
Use a little common sense before complaining about something. NO one cares if someone is decked out in Naxx gear, you will have the stuff that requires you to WORK and THINK for. MAN THE HEIGAN DANCE IS HARDLOL.<br />
Wait for Ulduar, and see what I'm talking about. Those terribles who are decked out in &quot;sick lolnaxx epix&quot; wont TOUCH anything compared to someone decked out in full t8 with the highest end weapons from 25 man. I'm sorry but you little pussies need to stop complaining so god damn much. THIS IS KARAZHAN PEOPLE.<br />
It'll get better.</div></div><hr />
