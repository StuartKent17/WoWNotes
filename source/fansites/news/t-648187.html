Wintergrasp Quests now Weekly<br />
Don't worry, Wintergrasp isn't really getting nerfed, the quest rewards are being changed to fit the new frequency. (Yes, you actually get 20 Stone Keeper Shard for a single quest now)<br />
In an effort to better balance the amount of players that are in Wintergrasp at any given time, we are changing the daily quests in Wintergrasp to a weekly format. This has led to an increase in the honor reward given by these quests as well as additional Stone Keeper's Shards. These quests will reset every Tuesday morning at 3:00 AM.<br />
<br />
There are two known issues that may occur once these changes are pushed to live realms:<br />
<br />
The quest mark will now show as gold, even though the quests are repeatable.<br />
After the quests reset, players near the NPC quest givers may need to move out of line of sight in order for the quests to properly appear.<br />

3.1.2 PTR Patch Notes<br />
The 3.1.2 official notes have been updated once again with the changes from the last 2 builds, latest additions are highlighted in green. <br />
World of Warcraft PTR Patch 3.1.2<br />
<br />
The latest patch notes can always be found at http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/patchnotes/ (http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/patchnotes/)<br />
<br />
The latest test realm patch notes can always be found at http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/patchnotes/test-realm-patchnotes.html (http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/patchnotes/test-realm-patchnotes.html)<br />
<br />
General<br />
New art textures have been added for Argent Tournament mounts. Any mounts already purchased from the Argent Tournament vendors will be updated automatically. Argent Tournament mounts with the old textures will still be available for purchase from the Argent Tournament vendors for a small Champion’s Seal and gold cost (standard faction requirements apply).<br />
Copied Test Realm characters will no longer be copied with their achievement history in order to better facilitate the character copy process.<br />
<br />
Equipment Manager<br />
When enabled from the Interface Options menu, this feature will allow players to store sets of equipment, easily swap between saved sets using hotkeys, and pull items directly from backpacks or bank slots (must be at the bank to equip inventory from the bank).<br />
<br />
PVP<br />
Vehicle health and damage output in Strand of the Ancients and Lake Wintergrasp now scale with the item level of the operator’s gear. Power scaling is now 1% damage and 1% health per average item level.<br />
All Lake Wintergrasp daily quests have been changed to a weekly format. The honor and Stone Keeper’s Shards rewarded for completing these quests have been increased to compensate.<br />

<br />
Glyphs<br />
Glyph of Conflagrate redesigned: When you use Conflagrate, the damage done by your next 3 Destruction spells is increased by 10% for 15 seconds if the Immolate on the target has 5 or fewer seconds remaining. (Even if this change is still in the official notes, it was reverted in an earlier PTR version and this might be a small mistake in the official note update. In the latest PTR build the glyph is: Your Conflagrate spell no longer consumes your Immolate or Shadowflame spell from the target.)<br />

Blood Boil: If no target is available for Blood Boil to hit, the spell will now cast and consume a blood rune but generate no runic power.<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/idruids.gif Druid <br />
Maim: Rank 2 of this ability is properly considered a stun and can be escaped by Blink.<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ihunters.gif Hunter <br />
Go For The Throat: Explosive Shot critical strikes now trigger this talent.<br />
Lock and Load: The tooltip has been corrected to display its actual chance to occur.<br />

http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ipaladins.gif Paladin<br />

MMO-Champion now on Facebook<br />
After the success of the Steam Group (http://steamcommunity.com/groups/mmo-champion) I just couldn't stop here. MMO-Champion is now on Facebook (http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=80351072309)! I also have a few ideas in mind for that group depending on how popular it gets. <br />
<br />

Blue posts<br />
Healing in Raids<br />
On the one hand, when a raid wipes it may always feel like it's your fault because people ultimately died and you're the ones supposed to stop people from dying. I'm not saying we make healing on raid content trivial. We don't. We want it to be a challenge. We want you to have to work at it and feel good when you finally get a new boss down. We want you to feel like the gear that drops is rewarding because you notice the difference.<br />
<br />
But I also think you're being a little unfair to dps to tanking. There are berserk timers on many bosses and it's the job of the dps to hit those timers. You can't necessarily solve that through healing expect by virtue of keeping them up and stabbing. On some fights all they are doing is damage, but on others they have to kill the right targets, or maximize their damage at the right moment (say XT's heart). They need to avoid AE damage. Mimiron's rockets do what 5 million damage?! If someone dies in that and asks &quot;WHY U NOT HELZ ME?&quot; you have my permission to reach through Vent and clock them on the skull. Tanking isn't easy either. If your tank fails to pick up adds and they run around one-shotting folks, that is not your responsibility to keep them standing. If they die with Last Stand or Icebound Fortitude not on cooldown, then they might need a tiny nibble of L2P.<br />
<br />
I've played all three roles quite a bit, and I don't find one to be hands down harder than another. I think tanking and healing are probably more stressful. You have to be ready from the pull -- you can't take a few seconds before you jump into things.<br />
<br />
Healing isn't for everyone. It takes a certain mindset. You aren't always going to be celebrated the way the rogue on top of the damage meters is. But every good guild knows it rests on the ability of its healers. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/16903658381-question-about-healer-philosophy.html))<br />
<br />
Armor Penetration Cap<br />
There are caps to armor pen, but the total amount of armor that can be reduced is not one of them. The numbers you need to really to get armor pen to the point where it feels broken cannot really be done with available gear. <br />
<br />
[...] There is a cap per point. You can't ignore more than a certain percentage of the armor per point. This is what keeps armor pen from being better vs. targets with lower armor.<br />
<br />
There is no cap on the amount of armor pen from which you can benefit. More points of armor pen always give you more damage (in the way more AP always gives you more damage, but more hit does not).<br />
<br />
We are familiar with some of the theorycrafting for how great armor pen might be for fully Ulduar-geared melee. We're not worried about it yet because it's a big improvement over armor pen being a junk stat, which is where it was for many until recently.<br />
<br />
We're not too worried about the double trinket proc in PvP. It's impossible to use on demand, you have to give your PvP trinket to do it, and it still isn't better vs. lightly armored targets, which is what we wanted to fix. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/16903658642-armor-penetratation--lack-of-a-cap.html))<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/idruids.gif Druid (3.1 Skills List (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=700) / 3.1 Talent + Glyph Calc. (http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?druid))<br />
Feral Cat DPS too high?<br />
The theoretical Feral dps suggested by simulations may be high because the reality is often different -- it's a pretty demanding spec to play and more dependent on attacks from behind than most.<br />
<br />
We don't often see cats beating rogues. They do sometimes beat mages, locks and hunters, but that is almost always on fights where we asked the ranged dps to be doing something else, such as moving or contending with adds. There are also some early fights in Ulduar that are very friendly to kitties, such as XT and Razorscale.<br />
<br />
It's definitely something to keep an eye on. If we made a small nerf to cat dps, nobody should be surprised, but we don't have one to announce at this time. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/16903518396-feral-dps-supposed-to-be-this-high-89k-dps.html))<br />

Ammo Changes<br />
Those are all still in the plan. We are always very reluctant to provide timelines unless we have some confidence that we can deliver. The community tends to be a tad unforgiving unless we offer a lot of caveats on everything we “promise.” I can understand how it can be difficult to be patient, but just realize the alternative is not that they get done faster but that we keep our ideas really close to the chest until they are about to go in the game. Some players would prefer this method of communication, which is understandable. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/16904206957-hunter-balanceblizzards-opinion--attempt-2.html))<br />
<br />
Pets scaling from Crit / Armor Penetration / Agility / AP / Haste<br />
Yes, we agree with all of that (more or less). The barrier in this case is technical -- it's just not set up to work that way, so it's not a quick change. But we would like to eventually get that fixed. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/16904206957-hunter-balanceblizzards-opinion--attempt-2.html))<br />
<br />
Pet DPS<br />
We don’t think it’s a strong design to have too much of your dps tied up in the pet, because then you are really crippled when it dies and we aren’t going to provide you with 100% certainty that that isn’t going to happen. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/16904206957-hunter-balanceblizzards-opinion--attempt-2.html))<br />
<br />
Steady Shot vs. Auto Shot<br />
We’ve been over this ground before, but it’s actually irrelevant if Steady does more or less damage than Auto since you can use them both together (unless it just offends your sensibilities or something). (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/16904206957-hunter-balanceblizzards-opinion--attempt-2.html))<br />
<br />
Glyph of the Monkey<br />
We think the Glyph of the Monkey was just too good. It made more sense back when you had to go to Monkey. But we didn’t want to keep that restriction when the whole point of Dragonhawk was to make you not have to shift Aspects all of the time. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/16904206957-hunter-balanceblizzards-opinion--attempt-2.html))<br />
<br />
Roar of Sacrifice<br />
We can understand how Roar of Sacrifice was cool because it gave you some utility you could share with the rest of your team. Maybe there is some way to bring back that functionality, possibly in a different ability. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/16904206957-hunter-balanceblizzards-opinion--attempt-2.html))</div></div><hr />

<br />
GG Blizz, way to screw people outta shards and honor<br />

This<br />

The only way to get less people into WG is removing the requirement for VoA which would make the entire battle more or less useless. Nerfing dailys will do absolutely nothing.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Seink</div><div class="date">2009-05-12, 06:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">In an effort to better balance the amount of players that are in Wintergrasp at any given time, we are changing the daily quests in Wintergrasp to a weekly format. This has led to an increase in the honor reward given by these quests as well as additional Stone Keeper's Shards. These quests will reset every Tuesday morning at 3:00 AM.<br />
<br />
This has got to be the dumbest move done by Blizzard to 'balance' stuff.<br />
<br />
What Blizzard is trying to do is reduce the amount of rewards from WG so as to reduce the # of active participants constantly playing throughout the week.However, the unbalance of the amount of players is due to the population disparity between the 2 faction, not the amount of active participants constantly playing.<br />
<br />
(If H:A is 500:700, assuming 10% active participants yields 5:7, a nerf to both sides simple reduces the ratio to a smaller number, not having an evening out the ratio.)<br />
<br />
The WG nerf only works if it discourage ONE side from having overwhelming majority. This WG nerfs applies to both side; thus reducing both the overwhelming side and undermanned side. This just spells less people will be playing WG.This does not solve any problem prenerf.<br />
<br />
Blizz could have achieve a more balance WG by lessening the advantages of having overwhelming majority( like inc effects of Tenacity...etc). But no.....blizz has to do something stupid....-_-''</div></div><hr />

Also, wintergrasp weekly quests, makes for a better incentive to &quot;do&quot; the quests imo.<br />
Less players will be there now though, especially if your server already has a lower number of players on one side of the faction.. might be crippling.<br />
<br />
In terms of rewards, its a buff even.<br />
Normally I can do the WG quests in the weekend = 2x reward.<br />

In the beginning of S5 warriors stood a chance, a small chance...but they could compete with others. When Dk/Pally teams learned of their OPness it was over for war/druid completly. Now in 3.1, We actually get back arms as a pvp spec, then Blizz takes it away from us. No on on the Blizz development team must play a warrior...honestly...The reason the 100% Juggernaut crit was there was because it helped remove shields that absorbed damage. Rage starvation is a big problem in arenas. Even if its either to use your next ability or to try to get back to your partner to intervene to get out of the way or defend your healer. If you wanted to nerf it, it should have been at least a 50% nerf...not 75%. Also, what about the Retpallys ability to AUTO CRIT when someone is stunned incapacitated or a rogues Cold Blood talent? 100% AUTO CRIT!!! Juggernaut was the exact same thing as that and i dont see you changing any of that. As for the glyph..it seems as though they looked at it and blew their nose with the piece of parchment an inscriptionest used to create the glyph. If anything it should have been moved to a minor glyph. I hate to say this but it really seems as though Blizz only listens to the QQers on high pop severs. And i guarantee the biggest complainers were priests...And i bet my money on that one. Sorry this is so long...but had to vent about this. Warriors will once again roam the bottom list of the arena ratings, and Blizz will do nothing to fix it.<br />
<br />
As for the WG weekly dailies....fucking stupid...loss of gold,honor,and shards. Now there isnt really a reason to go to WG since WinterLag is ALWAYS THERE. People dont go to WG to do dailies...they go to win and get access to Vault. Make it a BG instance or dedicate it to a different server or something.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ofc, im 100% sure this change will drop warriors to the bottom again. Or not. Seriously, are only crybabies left in this game. Juggernaut is still(will be) an awesome talent for warriors. The crit part will be a bonus, the talent is about mobility. And warriors kept it. <br />
The crit is just so minor part of it. Warriors still have 3 diffrent ways to move in combat and that is what boosted em to top (with the 75% healing reduction ofc aswell), not the crit part. Rage starvation(combined with stance dancing) is your problem. I suggest you learn to play not just randomly smash all cooldowns. Good warriors know when to save it up or blow it.</div></div><hr />

Having that auto crit made the healer take a big hit so when he did root the warrior, they would have to run way, giving the root time to run out and take time for the healer to run away instead of healing to full right on the spot. And I know how to save rage...What I was saying is that the good part about having an auto crit was to be able to save even more rage then before. Saying, &quot;Hey, no shield...ill wait till their healer is CCed then ill burst him down.&quot;</div></div><hr />

GG Blizz, way to screw people outta shards and honor<br />

Edit: On a side note, besides how much they would have to change the map, i wish they woulda just moved Wintergrasp out of the middle of the stupid zone and into a corner!<br />
<br />
<br />
some people have more to do in life than play world of warcraft, sometimes people only play a few hours a day, and sometimes those few hours a day wind up not being the same few that have control of WG, so sometimes people who still really want to do VOA have to wait till later in the week. i dont think it will be a total ghost town since you can still get the badges. and its fun to go and just kill other players.</div></div><hr />

As it stands at the moment, WG is the single best way of earning honour. The only way to stop people from obsessively counting down the minutes till WG and swarming the place like ants is to make it less beneficial to go in there. That's what they've done.<br />
<br />
They can improve their server architecture all they want, but nothing they can do is going to allow lag-free gameplay when 800 players are all setting off every spell effect under the sun within a 100 square yard space. The only solution open to them is to disincentivise people from going there every time WG is up, and thus spread the load over the whole week, which is what this change is trying to achieve. Seems like the best option for this stage- the only other feasible option as I can see it is to fundamentally redesign how WG works, which risks killing it completely rather than just cutting down the zerg factor (which I think this change might help solve).</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
LoL this is so true, i cant even possibly begin to imagine how much combat log information the poor server must trying to calcuate between 400 or 500 clients all spamming the crap out of each other all at once.<br />
<br />
If 500 players each performed just 1 AoE move on top of each other that is - <br />
<br />
500 x 500 = 250,000 processes per tic to calculate, and thats just with 1 spell each, it then has to communicate to each and every single player what is happening all at the same time.<br />
<br />
Peak times WG for me means waiting 10-60 seconds for 1 spell to activate, 10 frames per second in mass combat scenes, i even hit shadowmeld the other day and was running around shadowmeld stealthed for around 4 minutes.<br />
<br />
Lesser populated server probably dont know the meaning of lag at the moment, but seriously, a populated server is disconnects all over the place, instances lagging like fook, and completely unplayable WG.<br />
<br />

Blizzard have been trying to move away from zerg events like that and the opening of the Dark Portal (Northrend having 2 access points for eg), and I think they've now realised they've created just that kind of mass-grouping area in WG and need to cut down on the incentives that encourage people to go in.<br />
<br />
Players only go to a place en-mass when there's a high reward to effort ratio- to be honest I'm a little surprised they haven't changed the system of getting WG marks, or upped the cost of mark-bought gear as well, so people should really be grateful, I wouldn't be surprised if that's the next change... In reality it's too easy to get excellent PVP gear by just doing 2 or 3 WG's a day at the moment. You can pretty easily get 5 WG marks a day, which translates to a new piece of gear every 5-8 days, plus shedloads of honour from the dailies to buy more gear. So you end up spending an hour and a half a day in WG over 3 weeks and you have a full PVP set? That doesn't really ring true when you compare it to the effort required to obtain the equivalent full Ulduar set...</div></div><hr />

Yeah, im the one with the leet speech for sure, &quot;zomg ur in the 1300s&quot; . How did the warriors manage in season 1-4?

If u'r a charge-&gt;smash-&gt;smash, why cant i hit him, why are im dead, i pressed mortal strike?:O ..then of course its hard.Good warriors are happy with the combat charge(and as mentioned before, the 75% healing reduction, you can get off from every spell casted, not just the &quot;healing school&quot;, so dont come with the pummel crap).</div></div><hr />

&quot;Players can no longer become saved to an instance when they aren't in the instance during a boss kill.&quot;<br />
<br />
So you can go into the middle of a pug and not get saved until you guys down another boss? Is that what this is saying? If so that is pretty awesome to make sure that you aren't getting saved to a fail pug.<br />

For most active raiders, it's a big buff.<br />
We don't have to raid WG every day, and can do it in 1 day, and have MORE time to actually raid, do other dailies, tournament, fishing, cooking whatever.<br />

They said it wasn't balanced and would be looked at. GC said specifically that the crit chance and glyph would be balance options that they would look at.<br />

<br />
If 500 players each performed just 1 AoE move on top of each other that is - <br />
<br />
500 x 500 = 250,000 processes per tic to calculate, and thats just with 1 spell each, it then has to communicate to each and every single player what is happening all at the same time.<br />
<br />
Peak times WG for me means waiting 10-60 seconds for 1 spell to activate, 10 frames per second in mass combat scenes, i even hit shadowmeld the other day and was running around shadowmeld stealthed for around 4 minutes.<br />
<br />
Lesser populated server probably dont know the meaning of lag at the moment, but seriously, a populated server is disconnects all over the place, instances lagging like fook, and completely unplayable WG.<br />
<br />
Its mayhem every 2 hours :)<br />
<br />
<br />
All these arguments about the lag that WG is, well I was just fine until 3.1, I went twice a day and never had any lag problems. And there were fights with a lot of players there. First WG after WG and I was having 5-10 second lag spikes.<br />
<br />
Blizzard coders were sleeping while doing something on WG and is all broken now. Even when I tele, when attacking, I get 2-4 secs lag when I first get there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;In an effort to better balance the amount of players that are in Wintergrasp at any given time, we are changing the daily quests in Wintergrasp to a weekly format.&quot;<br />
Doesn't sound like quasi-marketing speak to me... Sounds pretty clear- we want less people obsessively counting down to every WG, so we're going to make it so that they can still get the benefits provided by doing occasional dailies, but allow them to achieve those benefits at any point in the week, rather than having to go in every day. Sounds ideal for everyone if you ask me- WG at the moment is surely not a happy place for Hardcore PVPers, unless you consider winning the battle by lagging out the defenders 'hardcore PVP'. <br />
<br />
People will still want to fight for WG as you say, both to get Emalon, and also to do their dailies- bear in mind that people do other things in this game- raiding, gathering, doing fishing and cooking dailies, heroics etc. Not everyone is going to rush into WG on a Tuesday if they happen to be raiding on that day. The population will be more spread across the week, and WG will turn into what it should be- zone-wide PVP based on coordination and strategy, not lag. If WG really is sparsely populated by Thursday then all it will demonstrate is that hardcore PVPers are really just loot-whores trying to maximise their honour per hour, rather than dedicated PVPers looking to reproduce epic Alliance vs Horde battles...</div></div><hr />

I Agree that it has been a pain due to high population on servers but at the same time now I expect that the WG raids will be lopsided since people don't really have as much of a reason to go without the daily.</div></div><hr />

Maybe this change from daily to weekly will help thin out the insane zerg at WG, but given that many people are there for easy marks+honor, I doubt this will make a huge dent.<br />
Sadly, I myself love huge zergfest fights as opposed to small &lt;10man fights, but unfortunately, the servers can't handle it yet...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Make a constructive suggestion to fix WG then, instead of crying 'nerf!' and saying 'omg death of WG'. Does everyone on this board have to be such a whiny biatch? People will still do WG for the reasons listed in the rest of this thread (try reading it before posting). People who will only do WG when they can get 5K honour and 3 marks for 20 minutes standing around in lag will not do it any more, or will do it once and then bugger off for the rest of the week. That will reduce the number of people in there and actually make it playable. That's a GOOD thing. I would prefer to play a lag-free WG with 50 people per side than a lagged-out WG with 200 per side.</div></div><hr />

WG has lagged the server for my server since day of release.<br />
<br />
We had to stop every single Naxxramus Immortal run and take a 30 minute break every 2 hours when WG started.<br />
<br />
Now my server has even more migrators (./spit) and its gone from terrible to totally unplayable.<br />
<br />
We have many situations where attackers cant win (lol) because they are rooted to the ground through lag for 2-3 minutes at a time, and defenders lag just as much but they end up winning by default because the first siege engines attack on the very first wall hasnt registered in half an hour on the server and not even one wall was broken down.<br />
<br />
As i say, lesser populated servers are fine, medium populated may experience slight lag, but high populated servers simply die.<br />

<br />
Precisely. The change is to get Honour farmers like you out of WG so it doesn't lag, therefore allowing the people who play it because they enjoy open-ended non-instanced epic PVP battles to actually have lag-free games. WG isn't there to give you free PVP epix, it's there as one strand of Blizzard's PVP offering- a strand that has been unplayable recently because people like you have realised they can farm WG dailies for free purples. Tough luck matey, you might actually have to go and do some actual PVP now...</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
While that might fix the problem to a certain extent, it would also involve a major redesign of the zone. Blizzard are more pragmatic than people give them credit for- this is a quick change in an attempt to resolve something that's a serious headache for a lot of players. WG has been getting worse over the last few months, and rather than making a major design change (like moving VOA or changing how it's accessed or even instancing WG or making a change to how often the battle happens) which would take 6 months of development time, they've made a quick change which might just cut down on the lag problem. I imagine they're still considering long-term options for WG, but at least this demonstrates they're responding quickly to player concerns. It also demonstrates that their players are never, EVER happy, whatever they do...</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's you. Before 3.1 my server was lucky to see 20 second lag spikes. Wintergrasp would crash the server at least once a week, and would typically end in a cripple fight in a molasses pit. The lag would seep out across Northrend and people would port to Org just so that they could retrieve items from ingame mails. Raids were almost impossible to do without experiencing at least an hour of lag - on several occasions lag so severe that it prevented even pulling the boss correctly.<br />
<br />
Lately it's so popular that the lag starts almost fifteen minutes before WG does. <br />

<br />
No, you are not misreading that. 450% of base mana regen would be about 230mp5 for a total gain of 920 mana. <br />
It grants 450% of the base mana pool, which is 15,732 mana.</div></div><hr />

It seem that Blizzard can't leave well enough alone. There will never be a happy medium in WoW. It is the nature of any mmorpg. Someone will always have a complaint about something in a game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And would your solution be multiplying everything by 7? 91G, 8.5K honour, 21 shards per weekly quest? Because that would be balanced, right? Having 4 weekly quests that took 20 minutes to do and rewarded 360G and 32K honour?<br />
<br />
WG grants too much honour, that's a fact. The evidence is the fact that it's so overcrowded- if it offered similar rewards to other BGs, you wouldn't see so many people dropping everything else to go and do it. Honestly, so many people complained about the Ulduar nerfs effectively handing gear to players in PVE, and yet in PVP it's somehow totally OK to offer dailies that award enough honour to be able to buy a piece of gear a week for only 20 minutes effort per day? Talk about wanting things on a plate...</div></div><hr />

patch 3.1.1: 1200 honor for a daily quest = 8400 honor a week<br />
patch 3.1.2: 3723 honor a week for completing a quest<br />
<br />
It's only a nerf if you actually do all the WG quests, every day, 7days a week.<br />

<br />
Actually, it's a nerf in shards and honor if you did the quests for more than 3 days per week.</div></div><hr />

If they want to nerf the wg quests, give us other. Perhaps instead of just one bg victory q/day give us 3 different bg victory q/day. Gold and honour is nice for pvpers, the stonekeeper shards is not really a big reason why to run wg quests. That would make this change fair.</div></div><hr />

But that's probably because on The Scryers we only rarely fill up the second raid group, sometimes even the first raid group doesn't get filled... at least on horde, I'd imagine that alliance seems to have about 20% more players then horde does.<br />
<br />
On another note, it would be really, really nice if Blizzard put a tad more effort it getting random starts for Strand.<br />
<br />
On yet another note, it seems that shamans once again get... um... untouched. Is WoW now balanced around Shamans? For once I'd like to see the OMG the Shaman's X ability is OP, instead of the, yea I just hate them and their totems (in particular as restro).</div></div><hr />

<br />
On a side note, has anyone seen any hackers in WG? You know... The Lv 58-61 characters in WG, when you know it is impossible to go into the zone, unless someone summons you. The players who can fly in WG when it's a non-flying zone. The player who can climb the mountains in and out of WG. Those jerks sneak in, mine and gather herbs, and then run off. I hope Blizzard will do more to eliminate them.<br />

But then, like blizzard likes to do, went to far the other way, be removing it from pets. Why? It has been 4 years of being able to hit lock pets, now suddenly it is a problem? Gimmie a break. Why must blizz always overreact? It is especially fruatrating because they are overreacting to a move that waas of their own stupidity anyway. <br />

It is so over the top that now even when a lock WILLINGLY turns themself into a DEMON exorcism doesn't work. <br />

<br />
Also, wintergrasp weekly quests, makes for a better incentive to &quot;do&quot; the quests imo.<br />
Less players will be there now though, especially if your server already has a lower number of players on one side of the faction.. might be crippling.<br />
<br />
In terms of rewards, its a buff even.<br />
Normally I can do the WG quests in the weekend = 2x reward.<br />
Now, 1x a week i can get 7x the reward in a single day. Good stuff :P<br />
<br />
Stop trying to agree with blizzard, your just making your self look bad, besides the reason why you think its a buff is because your a casual player who obviously only has time to do an hour of wintergrasp a week. Its a HUGE nerf for everyone, even if your a causual player. You loose half of the honor you'd gain, about 20-30 less shards, and around 300 or so gold. Now stop commmenting on stuff that you <br />
are obviously wrong about.</div></div><hr />

As it stands at the moment, WG is the single best way of earning honour. The only way to stop people from obsessively counting down the minutes till WG and swarming the place like ants is to make it less beneficial to go in there. That's what they've done.<br />
<br />
They can improve their server architecture all they want, but nothing they can do is going to allow lag-free gameplay when 800 players are all setting off every spell effect under the sun within a 100 square yard space. The only solution open to them is to disincentivise people from going there every time WG is up, and thus spread the load over the whole week, which is what this change is trying to achieve. Seems like the best option for this stage- the only other feasible option as I can see it is to fundamentally redesign how WG works, which risks killing it completely rather than just cutting down the zerg factor (which I think this change might help solve).<br />
<br />
You. Are. Clueless. This will pack things up into one day. It used to be spread out during the week because the quests would reset the next day.</div></div><hr />

So you end up spending an hour and a half a day in WG over 3 weeks and you have a full PVP set? That doesn't really ring true when you compare it to the effort required to obtain the equivalent full Ulduar set...<br />
<br />
Ok, so your compairing ulduar gear with hateful type quality gear? You can only get hateful with the WG marks / honor. So stop QQing about balanced stuff.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For most active raiders, it's a big buff.<br />
We don't have to raid WG every day, and can do it in 1 day, and have MORE time to actually raid, do other dailies, tournament, fishing, cooking whatever.<br />
Where previously I'd do the WG quests 1-2x a week, I now get 3-5x the rewards for the same amount of time spent.<br />

<br />
Its called disable AOEs.<br />
<br />
100s of chars rolling attacks on 100s of other chars isn't that bad, its when each person is laying down their own targeting circles/whatever on the other 100 all by themselves.<br />
<br />
Cannons and vehicles would need a serious tweak, but perhaps they could make them actually hurt a target by themselves instead of spamming a limp aoe that any healer worth their salt can counter all day long.</div></div><hr />

etc etc etc<br />
<br />
<br />
Maybe this change from daily to weekly will help thin out the insane zerg at WG, but given that many people are there for easy marks+honor, I doubt this will make a huge dent.<br />
Sadly, I myself love huge zergfest fights as opposed to small &lt;10man fights, but unfortunately, the servers can't handle it yet...<br />

Does everyone on this board have to be such a whiny biatch? People will still do WG for the reasons listed in the rest of this thread (try reading it before posting). People who will only do WG when they can get 5K honour and 3 marks for 20 minutes standing around in lag will not do it any more, or will do it once and then bugger off for the rest of the week. That will reduce the number of people in there and actually make it playable. That's a GOOD thing. I would prefer to play a lag-free WG with 50 people per side than a lagged-out WG with 200 per side. <br />
<br />
Wrong. Stop making arguments, and stop posting random things. This is going to make things WORSE. lag will be MUCH bigger now.</div></div><hr />

The change is to get Honour farmers like you out of WG so it doesn't lag, therefore allowing the people who play it because they enjoy open-ended non-instanced epic PVP battles to actually have lag-free games. WG isn't there to give you free PVP epix, it's there as one strand of Blizzard's PVP offering- a strand that has been unplayable recently because people like you have realised they can farm WG dailies for free purples. Tough luck matey, you might actually have to go and do some actual PVP now...<br />

Blizzard are more pragmatic than people give them credit for- this is a quick change in an attempt to resolve something that's a serious headache for a lot of players. WG has been getting worse over the last few months, and rather than making a major design change (like moving VOA or changing how it's accessed or even instancing WG or making a change to how often the battle happens) which would take 6 months of development time, they've made a quick change which might just cut down on the lag problem. I imagine they're still considering long-term options for WG, but at least this demonstrates they're responding quickly to player concerns. It also demonstrates that their players are never, EVER happy, whatever they do...<br />
<br />
The reason why people are never happy is because everything they do with WG is going down the wrong direction, but you seem to agree because your bored with your spare time and you want to post things that aren't true.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1) Even without the dailies WG offers the best mark rewards and honor / time ratio of any of the BGs if you are PvPing and the WG timer goes off you would be a fool to miss it even if you have the dailies completed.<br />
<br />
2) VoA is tied to the winning team and with both 10 man and 25 man pugable everyone wants to get a group together and clear it on both 10 and 25 man modes.<br />
<br />
Ways to fix the population issue:<br />
<br />
1) Make VoA an instance unlockable by winning a WG once durring the week once you have won you can zone into WG from a Dalaran portal any time you want before the next reset.<br />
<br />
2) Get rid of the WG marks, and the WG mark gear. Roll the gear it into normal honor gear that way PvPers arn't forced to WG to get the trinkets.<br />
<br />
The WG mark removal wont go over well but it is stupid that WG marks are so much better than all other BG marks you could make them a required part of the repeatable honor turn in or make em redemable for any other mark (this should be implemented with every bg mark make it so you can exchanged 2x of one mark for a joker you can use as any mark you choose).<br />
<br />
A third way to fix (or at least reduce) the lag would be to discourage the use of AoE. AoE lags the server by creating lots of combat data as you hit multiple targets but also lags players graphics trying to display the AoE of 4 dozen mages / locks / rogues / dks all desparately spamming there AoE buttons as they stare at 10 sec lag.<br />
<br />
If AoE hit for 1/10th of its normal damage in the WG zone players would be much more likely to single target nuke and while SoC spammers and FoK rogues would do less damage the servers would get bombarded with less data. Fixing the turrets and tanks so that there AoE is still viable but the damage radius is smaller would also help out.</div></div><hr />

I would if several others did not already say what needs to be said. Both before and after me. It's just obvious that he's wrong.<br />

I think you're confusing whining with a logical, well constructed argument. Understandable since you seem incapable of anything but replying to every post you disagree with 'No, you're wrong, no, you're wrong'. In the immortal words of Monty Python 'That isn't an argument, it's just contradiction!'</div></div><hr />

It's about time that they make Lake Wintergrasp an instance, instead of it being so open. Anyone can fly in at any given point and time during a fortress battle. You know the servers with the advantage in faction number will always complain. I am currently on a server where the Alliance has a 4:1 ratio over the Horde. So, anytime the Horde seems to be winning at WG, all they got to do is call in their buddies, and boom! The Horde loses.</div></div><hr />

Exorcism being allowed to be used on players had obvious problems that even a casual would see right away. When it was returned to normal that was a smart move. <br />
<br />
But then, like blizzard likes to do, went to far the other way, be removing it from pets. Why? It has been 4 years of being able to hit lock pets, now suddenly it is a problem? Gimmie a break. Why must blizz always overreact? It is especially fruatrating because they are overreacting to a move that waas of their own stupidity anyway. <br />
<br />
It is so over the top that now even when a lock WILLINGLY turns themself into a DEMON exorcism doesn't work. <br />
<br />
Overreaction to a problem that didn't exist till 3 weeks ago is laughable, fickle, and immature. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I agree with you for the most part, however I dont see the problems that came about with exorcism being used on pvp players to begin with. Iam not saying Pallys are bad in pvp now because of it but saying that it was overpowered compared to alot of other damaging attacks that other classes have is just rediculous. Death knights locks mages shamans rouges shadow priests, all of these classes have insane ammount of hard hitting abilities, death knights and shamans being the worst of them. An ability that crits all of the time on undead or demon npcs, and has maybe a 3.5k at most damaging attack with a 15 second cool down is not over powered what so ever. DK's are a melee class and they have a wide variety of close range, mid range, long range attacks. Ghouls, and gargs, you name it. What exorcism did was made it just a tiny bit difficult for classes to kite palladins around so they arent getting nuked by other classes with little worry and then its taken out of the pvp spectrum completly? <br />
<br />
Its pretty crazy if you ask me. So now in arenas you have locks who can summon their pet right away after killing them the first time having some more leeway, same with hunters, and again same with deathknights. What Iam trying to figure out is, why is the game progressively getting even more unbalanced. <br />
<br />
Now I have'nt logged in yet and seen if exorcism still doesnt work on a dk's gargoyal or their ghoul but I mean come on, how the hell can it be justified that the most overpowered class in the game gets a little more help. Why even take away a 15 second cooldown ability, and if the devs want to balance the pvp spectrum of the game do it, dont just say you want to and do the exact opposite, and if you really want to keep the game unbalanced then just come out and say so, lol why the bullshit?</div></div><hr />

<br />
The other option is to reduce the amount of marks you get, or to increase the cost of mark-bought gear, but I think that would provoke such a hail of QQ they're probably trying to steer clear of it. Longer term the options are to separate VoA from WG as has been suggested, or change the wider mechanics of the battle. Those will take longer to develop though- I suspect this is just an interim 'see how it goes' measure.</div></div><hr />

And less fun Wintergrasp is. Don't you think it would be better to go for a solution that keeps it fun and also reduces the lag? I mean heck they could just get rid of it and there'd be no complaints at all! If they did it right, they could instance it but still have it impact the game world and have very little change from now. People could go in when they want, it would still be a PvP zone, its just for the actual wintergrasp event, they would be warped to instanced zones. People who enter from the portals in Dalaran like 90% of people do wouldn't even notice a difference.</div></div><hr />

Now they are nerfing it because they are too cheap to implement it properly and support by proper hardware. Too bad.... But as they can't even multiply by 7 properly, I am not surprised. Speaking about &quot;how impossible it is to do it properly&quot; - It is possible, providing you spend your millions on good programmers rather than executive bonuses and don't have idiots among managers.<br />
<br />
And warriors - welcome to the club. Now you should better feel why some paladins think blizzard don't have very good ability to plan their changes consequence. <br />
<br />
All in all, I would really like to see the correlation between this &quot;improvements&quot; announcements every now and then and amount of people canceling their account/leaving game. I think that with they recent &quot;we release about a week before we start thinking about consequences&quot; strategy this would be very discouraging statistic. Providing, the goal is not actually to *reduce* amount of subscribers. <br />
<br />
On the unrelated note, after another bunch of &quot;good news&quot; from blue, I finally decided there's a bit more WoW in my life then the current company attitude deserve and logged to my Magic the Gathering Online account, I haven't visited since 2005..... Guys, if you think Blizzard are cheap and making crap, you are wrong.... Blizzard are excellent, WoW is great and all minor nuances are nothing.

1) Wintergrasp is good<br />
2) There is nothing as good as wintergrasp for casual PVP players<br />
To reduce amount of people hitting WG every 2 hours the *good* solution would be to create an appropriate alternative. Implement new BG. Improve old BG - for instance find the reason why most of BG oriented PVP guilds are disbanded now and find a solution for a problem. Make something with arena, so it's not for few elitists from the right classes. Create another world PVP. <br />
Blizzard have already successfully implemented this strategy with 2 starting zones of WOTLK, btw.</div></div><hr />

Aye.... That's generally a good idea.... Remove Ulduar - no problems with complexity adjustments.... Remove half of the classes - much less problems with balancing. In fact - leave only on class - that for sure will be only skill competition in arena. This way 50% of subscribers will be &quot;removed&quot; too - so no problems with server loading. The only problem is there will be 50% less money, but, what the hell, remove CEO and couple of other VP and O - problems solved too -)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Eve online does this quite easily now, and often with battles involving more than 1k players. These used to be lagfests until they put up a flexible (and just awesome) server architecture where some servers acts as backup, when one starts being overloaded a second server shares computing with it, and if needed, a third one, etc. Managing thousands of players in one zone is really doable (not easily, but very doable), the real problem after this is done is your own computer... very few are able to display all this quick enough (hence a lot of people complaining about &quot;lag&quot; when it's only their computer displaying 5fps).<br />
But this should be really easier to do in wg, since battle times are fixed, whereas in eve this can happen anytime, and anywhere.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gilfanon</div><div class="date">2009-05-13, 10:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was quite interested to read your comment about EVE- I work in Enterprise Application implementation and I'd read about EVE's single server infrastructure before, but I was surprised to read that 1000 player battles were possible, so I did some research and found this article from about 6 months ago:<br />
<br />
&quot;With a single game world, players are free to flock to whatever solar system they like even if the server that solar system is on can't handle the load. Popular trade hub Jita and several popular mission-running systems such as Dodixie suffer badly from lag at peak play times on the weekend. Massive fleet battles over important territory often suffer from the same crippling lag, turning what should be an amazing sci-fi space battle into a poor slideshow.&quot;<br />
<br />
(Original article here http://www.massively.com/2008/09/28/eve-evolved-eve-onlines-server-model/)<br />
<br />
So EVE experienced the same problems as you said... In fact according to the article they've put player caps on solar systems that are overpopulated- so however good their server architecture is, it still couldn't handle excessive load. They've subsequently had to rewrite all their core code to implement changes to manage that load. That's a massive investment in time and effort, which is warranted in their case (massive PVP is the whole point of EVE) but wouldn't be in WOW which is first and foremost a PVE game...<br />
<br />
The other point to make is that redundant server architecture is a lot easier to manage in a case like EVE's where you have only one game server- you can pile as many servers into the mix as you like and balance server load across them. Slightly trickier when you have hundreds of game servers, probably architected around server clusters- having extra processing power added to one cluster isn't going to help you if it's a completely different cluster having load issues... I don't think there's a tech solution to this- it would make zero business sense to spend a hundred million dollars chucking technology at an aspect of the game that runs for 20 minutes at a time and is overpopulated 3 times a day in the evening. I'd rather they spent that money on developing additional content and instead found a functional rather than technical solution to the issue- the 3.1.2. change is their first attempt at that...</div></div><hr />

<br />
This new system was introduced in the end of last year, with Quantum rise expansion ( http://www.eveonline.com/pressreleases/default.asp?pressReleaseID=51 ), so I'm not sure this article tested the game with these improvements.<br />
<br />
Few days after this was deployed, the well known &quot;Jita&quot; system they talk about in your article went up to 1400 players (about 800 usually before this patch)</div></div><hr />

New BG apparently coming in 3.2. That will hopefully help. The reward ratio of WG still needs to be tweaked though- it's too beneficial to run WG, that's why everyone does it. If that wasn't the case people would have stopped running it after all this lag started, because we sure as hell ain't doing it for the fun times at the moment...</div></div><hr />

Hence there will still be more people in there than the servers can handle so the quest nerf will not end the lag. You still need to be in a lot of WGs to get the required WG marks.<br />
<br />
<br />
Building my druid tank set, (got outbid on the tier 7.5 chest, still have a blue) means I need 40 WG tokens for the chest and I've already spent the 40 for the headpiece. Took a while to get those tokens, with a 2:1 alliance:horde ratio on my server, if we (horde) lose WG, we might not get it back if the incentive to be there is gone.<br />

Really Gilfanon? Why do you keep whining about logic without contributing?<br />
<br />
<br />
Don't worry, Wintergrasp isn't really getting nerfed, the quest rewards are being changed to fit the new frequency. (Yes, you actually get 20 Stone Keeper Shard for a single quest now) - This is the source of a lot of the inflammation, except that that wasn't by a blue post and it isn't 20 (10? what?). Interestingly enough, the only source I can find for this is mmo-champion itself. Please someone confirm this. So maybe it's not fair to say it was billed as a non-nerf when the source of the statement itself should be suspect when paired with the screenie or by clicking on the source.<br />
<br />
According to a blue, Crygil:<br />
<br />
In an effort to better balance the amount of players that are in Wintergrasp at any given time, we are changing the daily quests in Wintergrasp to a weekly format. This has led to an increase in the honor reward given by these quests as well as additional Stone Keeper's Shards. These quests will reset every Tuesday morning at 3:00 AM.<br />
<br />
<br />
2) doing Lake Wintergrasp once or twice a day to get all of the dailies done is becoming a more convenient, efficient way of obtaining honor than signing up for battlegrounds - Er, it has always been, not &quot;becoming&quot;. This is a bit aggravating to see. Just as people learn how to play (it's all progress bars and numbers in a social context), it's being changed.<br />
<br />
Regardless of the (in)accuracy of the mmo-champ posting or if the initial offerings were uncharacteristically high to start, we can see that this is an attempt to balance a gameplay element that could be called BG participation parity. Whatever the name you give this &quot;balance&quot; referred to, it's a nerf by definition.<br />

<br />
I don't mind critical trolling, as long as they are correct. Gilfanon's wrong.<br />
<br />
<br />
a) I have made multiple posts throughout this thread stating what I feel is Blizzard's reason and justification for this change. Every one of my suppositions has been subsequently confirmed by Blizzard posters, for example the post &quot;doing Lake Wintergrasp once or twice a day to get all of the dailies done is becoming a more convenient, efficient way of obtaining honor than signing up for battlegrounds.&quot; This was my suggestion throughout the thread, that the reward to time ratio for participating in WG was too high, hence the number of people spending all their time skipping BGs and just obsessively doing every WG that comes up. <br />
<br />
b) Those who truly enjoy the WG experience should rejoice- they will still be able to earn (a reduced amount of) honour, shards, marks and gold while hopefully enjoying less lag, and having fewer casual PVPers in WG who are only in there to get free gear. Those who only played WG because &quot;OMG i canz has leet ipx right&quot; will soon realise that there's not much point in them trying to repeatedly farm WG for honour when they can't short-cut to honour-bought gear by making 40K a week in daily honour. How exactly are you interpreting this argument of mine as a whine that contains no contribution? I see no proposal from you for how to fix WG, just a whine that you can't get as much free shit as you used to.<br />
<br />
c) Calling me wrong doesn't make you right. I know the internet feels like a fantasy playground where you can just toss out comments and do the kind of macho posturing you're too chickenshit to do in real life, but in reality to get any kind of respect you actually have to back up your arguments. Tell me why I'm wrong. Set out your case and make the points that prove you right. That's called intelligent debate, everything you've spewed is just meaningless cavil.</div></div><hr />
