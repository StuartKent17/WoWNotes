A lot of people still wonder how the dungeon Call to Arms works and I hopped on PTRs to check it out. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
When the Call To Arms is active for a role, a gold circle will appear around the icon and Satchel of Exotic Mysteries (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/69903/satchel-of-exotic-mysteries/) will be an extra reward.<br />
Satchel of Exotic Mysteries (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/69903/satchel-of-exotic-mysteries/) is the bag containing the extra reward with a low chance of mount/pet and will be bound on account. (See Dungeon Finder Call to Arms - Clarification (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/2245-Dungeon-Finder-Call-to-Arms-Clarification))<br />
Call to Arms for more than one role can be active at a time.<br />
If everything seems balanced, there isn't any Call to Arms. <br />

Rated Battlegrounds VS. The Blues<br />
It looks like the lack of blue posts lately is because the blues have been spending most of their time training in PvP! <br />
Greetings Once Again!<br />
<br />
I know a lot of you had fun a couple weeks back when we logged on to the PTRs and ran ZA &amp; ZG with you. Well, we're coming back! This time however rather than fighting alongside you we're going to be duking it out on the fields of honor, better known as Rated Battlegrounds!<br />
<br />
We're going to be online tomorrow, 4/12/2011, at 4:30pm PST.<br />
<br />
To participate you'll need to roll Horde characters (we flipped a coin) and form teams on the Broxigar PTR realm. The reason we're specifying a faction is because this is actually a big test of our experimental same-faction rated battlegrounds.<br />
<br />
Hope to see you online, I'm sure this'll be a blast! <br />
<br />
<br />
Patch 4.1 - New Game Master/Support Interface<br />

Question is for the CTA's, can you only get the satchel 7 times in a week? &quot;You may recieve this award 7 more times this week&quot;<br />

I think players will hold off doing the Random if they cant get a chance at satchel.</div></div><hr />

Pretty sure that is just relating to the VP reward and the new 7 VP randoms/week as opposed to one/day. The Satchel is just there as there is no other place for the reward to go.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That has to do with valor points, there a weekly instead of a daily now an can be done up to 7 times per week. The satchels are unlimited if you meet the requirement.</div></div><hr />

They keep adding gunk in to 4.1<br />
As Daily Blink pointed out, the reality of the new system will probably lead on more terribad tanks in. And for those who will pug ZA and ZG that's pretty horrible; though again I understand their perspective of everything. It's definitely starting to become frustrating.</div></div><hr />

Could always roll a healer/tank, no one's making you stick with a pure DPS class.<br />

Oh they're complaining about just about everything, as usual. Mostly the &quot;but what about meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!?&quot; special dps snowflakes complaining about not getting a goodie bag though. Especially the pure dps classes who can't take advantage of it without playing an alt.</div></div><hr />

They complaining about giving the opportunity to tanks/healers to get mounts that are ugly,outdated and soloable.<br />
If they have decided to include new mount then they will complaining for giving new mount to tank and healers.<br />
If they did nothing they will complaining about 1 hour queues.<br />
<br />
You really can't have a social and constructive dialog with a whining psychopath do you?<br />
Well Blizzard thinks the same so ignores the whining and i'm 100% with it.</div></div><hr />

Please note that this is only for RATED battlegrounds. Regular ones should have the same ole unbalanced queues as long as Horde is the more popular faction to PvP as.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, it means that instead of having to do a random every day of the week, you can for example do 3 on tuesday, 2 on wednesday, and another 2 on Friday and be done with it for the week. <br />
<br />
I'm unsure how this will affect queues, it can really go both ways.<br />
<br />
<br />
so dps will never be able to get the call to arms satchel??? Im so glad i play i single role class............................................. .........warlock <br />

your queues will hopefully be shorter. You can get the satchel by rolling a healer or tank alt, that's not complicated, I have 2 of both and my main's a lock.</div></div><hr />

Basically, we'll get overwhelmed by Healers &amp; Tanks because every one that don't need VP from Random Heroics but need mounts, will run them on alts and not on their Mains (DPS'ers).<br />
<br />
After a while, random queues for DPS'ers will be 3-4 minutes when Healers/Tank will take 5-6 minutes.<br />

Actually, if it ever happened that there was more healers and tanks than DPS in the queue (remember that the ratio of healers:tanks:dps in a group is 1:1:3) then the DPS would get a Call to Arms, and all those tanks and healers in the queue would no longer be part of the CtA and thus less of them would queue... <br />
<br />
It's a self-resolving issue, in short. The queue times should be equal for all classes bar those who are part of the current CtA. You should see a result ala: CtA class: instant queue, the rest: 5-6 mins.</div></div><hr />

Agreed. People can make sure they hit the john before they queue if it is short. When Blizzard screwed everything up and suddenly this expansion queues skyrocketed, the window became too large to expect everyone to not have anything come up.</div></div><hr />

I still cant see how people can fail on HC's, they nerfed the HC's SOO SOOO SOO MUCH!<br />
HC's were easy already when they just released them. <br />

<br />
Good news! With 4.1 comes a new dungeon that requires AiL 345 to enter, i.e. there won't be a single green amongst the pugs gear! (even if you had all 345 bar one green (typical green is about 316 at best) then your AiL can't be higher than 343). Thus you won't spend any time with green-geared pugs in a heroic dungeon.<br />
<br />
Seriously, stop exaggerating and come up with a better reason. Not leaving guild mates behind? valid. Not wanting to put up with whiny DPS who pull before you? valid. Assuming that all pugs are green-geared in heroics? Invalid.<br />
<br />
What you'll get if you answer the CtA is a bag of goodies, which can contain rare mounts, pets, etc. If you don't want it then this doesn't apply to you, so no need to reply..</div></div><hr />

What makes non rated battlegrounds successful is that you don't have to build your own team to participate, simply queue in and play. This is cool but not challenging and rewarding enough for everyone. What people wanted is serious pvp in big groups but no building and managing your own team, or in other words nothing like arena.<br />
<br />
Everyone assumed rated battlegrounds would rate your personal performance and participation to the battleground, but instead we got arena 2.0. Rated battlegrounds is simply a bigger versions of arenas....</div></div><hr />

Great idea. Maybe do it like they were doing the heroic daily back in the day. Every day have a new call to arms role. If you miss out, you have to wait a few days until you get your free loot.<br />

well to get tank gear you need to get the drops first. so st*t loads of DPS are gona flood the queues, rests simply gona reg as tanks and act stupid.<br />
<br />
And also casuals not gona please the system for some mount. they play for fun and tanking is not fun for casuals.</div></div><hr />

Basically, we'll get overwhelmed by Healers &amp; Tanks because every one that don't need VP from Random Heroics but need mounts, will run them on alts and not on their Mains (DPS'ers).<br />
<br />
After a while, random queues for DPS'ers will be 3-4 minutes when Healers/Tank will take 5-6 minutes.<br />
<br />
//OgaitIf that ever happends (don't worry - it dont) then Blizzard were successful in reducing queue times for DPS from 20-50 minutes to 3-4 minutes (or even instant if dps will be the limiting factor).<br />
<br />
AND if that happends (lack of dps - overflow of healers and tanks) - then you only get goodie bag if you join queue as single DPS - not as tank or healer (or all three roles get one - or no role get one).<br />
<br />
Blizzard WANT people to join the queue as tank or healer. If people plyaing a hybrid shift from dps to tank or healer - or if they run dungeons on their tank alt. Doesn't matter. It is all good. It reduce queue times for DPS. Goal is meet.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
What I am worried about is all them tanks that normally ran instances with a premade group, now will run the instance solo instead. And the DPS they played with will now enter the LFD queue. So you might get more tanks to sign up, but you might also get more DPS.<br />
<br />
...but overall queue times should probably go down for DPS = A Good Thing(tm)</div></div><hr />

I think players will hold off doing the Random if they cant get a chance at satchel.<br />

<br />
You do realize that CTA will encourage a lot of geared knowledgeable tanks to queue up more often too (and perhaps even more than bad tanks). Bad tanks already queue up because they need the points and gear and don't want to wait. Good tanks don't queue because they generally need nothing but VP (if even that) so they run one dungeon a day (and probably queue with guildies). This change gives them some incentive to queue without their guildies or even to keep queueing after they've run their first 7 in the week.<br />
<br />
A lot of playtime on my tank is spent in old dungeons and such trying to get pets and mounts. With CTA, I can earn the same rewards by doing high level dungeons - so that means I will actually queue up more often as a tank.</div></div><hr />

- But I just want my satchel !!<br />

Doing rd with pugs will be even more fun than before.<br />
<br />
People will learn quickly that you have to actually FINISH the instance to get your rewards. <br />

This makes no sense. DPS will have 3-4 minutes AND tanks/healers 5-6? Considering (I assume) that the system will start a dungeon as soon as it gets 1 healer, 1 tank and 3 dps, there should nearly always be at least one role with an instant queue...<br />

This is cool but not challenging and rewarding enough for everyone. What people wanted is serious pvp in big groups but no building and managing your own team, or in other words nothing like arena.<br />
<br />
Everyone assumed rated battlegrounds would rate your personal performance and participation to the battleground, but instead we got arena 2.0. Rated battlegrounds is simply a bigger versions of arenas....<br />
<br />
You must be delusional I don't even know a single person who believed it where to be random bg with rating. How are you going to be ranked like that anyway? From killing blows? Dmg / healing done? Number of dispels? Flag / base caps? or what? There is so much things in a bg that is important and dividing the different jobs among the team players is what you need to do to win. <br />
<br />
There is no skill what so ever in a random BG, anyone can farm the GY when the enemy players are half decked in green gear and don't even know how there own spells works. Playing rated BG on a high level is really hard and freaking challenging which makes it really fun.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A tank greifing the LFD tool is much easier to deal with, so no, not the same. <br />
<br />
A gold seller is typically a hacked account, and Blizz has done as much as they can with regards to this; they have an education program on scam e-mails &amp; websites, they have suggested password policies and even token-based authenticators (free for your fancy mobile to boot!). If you get hacked these days then you're to blame. <br />
<br />
Botters require a large amount of monitoring to prove that the person in question is botting. As soon as it's confirmed they're botting action can be taken, but again a large number of confirmed bots are hacked accounts.<br />
<br />
Someone griefing the LFD tool isn't a bot, it isn't a hacked account, it's someone being a dick and Blizz is very good at resolving that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The only thing that I'm worried about is actually with dps that I might find, sure, today there are bad DPS, but I'm sure I'll somehow manage to find worse after the patch.<br />
<br />
For example, whenever I do randoms with my warlocks, my groups tend to down, say, Grand Vizier Ertram, in less than 4 shield retracts, 4 if someone screws up and get caught in a slow from the shield. With a group I had saturday as a tank, the group took 8 freaking shield retracts to be killed, I was almost seriously thinking we would wipe due to healer mana going dry.</div></div><hr />

With 4.1 comes a new dungeon that requires AiL 345 to enter, i.e. there won't be a single green amongst the pugs gear! (even if you had all 345 bar one green (typical green is about 316 at best) then your AiL can't be higher than 343). Thus you won't spend any time with green-geared pugs in a heroic dungeon. <br />
<br />
IMO(at least I hope so) this dungeon will be hard enough to be almoust impossible to complite with pugs in 345ilvl gear. There will be no pug groups to even queue this dungeon. <br />
Also its really easy to get ilvl 345 with ilvl352 pvp gear, with items not for your class/spec(like cloth items for warrior). Its even worse, than green.<br />
<br />
<br />
Seriously, stop exaggerating and come up with a better reason. Not leaving guild mates behind? valid. Not wanting to put up with whiny DPS who pull before you? valid. Assuming that all pugs are green-geared in heroics? Invalid.<br />
<br />
Ofc its valid. Think logicaly. There is no reason for epic geared dps to queue solo to random heroic. Guild group? Maybe. Solo? Almoust impossible. 40 minute wait time to finally get in pug that will wipe on first boss that requires some kind of strategy? No way :)<br />
With really rare exceptions 4/5 of random group will allways be in blue/green gear.<br />
Cmon, be realistic. Queue random heroics several times and gather some statistics. Majority of players do random heroics to gear up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Way to completely skip the part of his post that refuted your argument. In case you really did just miss it, I'll ask again myself. How is Blizzard supposed to rate an individual's performance in a battleground where a wide range of action contribute to victory? What metric are they supposed to use? If you do a little searching, this is nearly the exact explanation that Blizzard gave when ask why rated battlegrounds had to be premades, and why it took so long to get rated battlegrounds at all. It is nearly impossible to fairly rate an individual's performance in what is an inherently team based activity.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just had someone queue into a random dungeon as a tank. He was a Paladin in nearly full PVP Holy gear with a Prot spec. He had 65k mana with 2 items that didn't have Stam/Int on them and one strength DPS trinket. When we asked him why he had an agility weapon and healing gear on as a tank, he said &quot;I'm still getting gear.&quot; and proceeded to run, alone I might add, into the group of enemies as the other 3 people in the group stood back with me and watched him die in a quarter of a second. We told him that he shouldn't be queuing as a tank without having any tank gear at all and he had a fit. We kicked him out and one of the other people left, just to be replaced with a Warlock that had a +130 Agility enchant on his staff that pulled 2k DPS and couldn't figure out how to face enemies to cast.<br />
<br />
Bads are bad, not much you can do about that. That's the risk you run by using LFG. If there's any way you can get past the dregs that tend to use the tool it really does speed up finding a group if you're just trying to get your daily in for the points.</div></div><hr />

Granted, I've seen a fair share of this (once even with a person with 10 peices of pvp gear and 2 peices of healer gear as a dps caster...). What would be nice is for Blizz to make it so that the AiL of PvP items doesn't count towards your AiL for the LFD tool. It'd be even better if they made it so that it actually valued your gear based on your current selected queued spec so that you could eliminate under-geared tanks from queuing as such.<br />

I still queue them for chaos orbs. Not everyone in my guild wants to do a heroic when I'm up (typically I'm up past midnight (+one for the insomnia club!), ergo no one is online from the guild anyway). I'm sitting in AiL 357 gear, and it's rare for me to see anyone in a heroic below an AiL of 340 these days, even in pugs. Might just be down to the server?</div></div><hr />

If the tank is total trash, you won't get anywhere near the last boss.proper use of interupts, spellsteal/purge, cc and emergency cc (earth elemental, dogs of war, smoke bomb, blind, ring of frost, dragon's breathe, intimidating shout, that balance druid knockback, that warlock aoe stun, etc etc) let you do most pulls with pure dps. If our tank drop we often push on. All the way up to the boss. While we wait for a tank to join. Some bosses are even doable on four people without a tank...<br />
<br />
Tank used to be the most demanding role to play. But as long as they have good players backing them up, then all tanks can do some basic aoe tanking just using 3-4 abilities. Spam swipe+thrash and on a random demorolizing roar here and there. Or spam hammer and a finisher while alternate consecration+holy wrath. Or thunderclap and shockwave while spamming cleave and revange.<br />
<br />
I can honestly only think of a handful bosses where the tank actually have to have brains to not wipe the party.</div></div><hr />

Give an incentive to people who should NEVER play heals or tanks to roll them. Yet another reason PUG's will result in more tears and more rage. If I owned controlling stock in Blizzard's parent company, there'd be so many pink slips going out today on the design team.<br />
<br />
I haven't actually read further into this thread than this, but I can assume there are several such replies stating similar opinions.<br />
While I do agree that this will inspire a few.. erm.. inexperienced tanks to be rolled, new tanks are rolled every day already so this should not be having the detrimental effect that many seem to think it will. <br />
<br />
I believe this could actually change the average quality of tank you get for the better(even if the worse change outweighs it in the end). <br />
As a main-spec tank I find enjoyment in tanking my guild raids, but I find myself queuing for my daily random heroic as dps(only) because in my experience, I cannot relax while tanking a heroic due to the poor attitude and reckless actions of the dps - and many times due to the difficulty of killing a 5man boss with the dps doing barely as much single-target damage as I am tanking.<br />
<br />
I say these things so that people understand why they rarely see the geared and experienced tanks in LFD groups. Most weeks I only need 2 or so days worth of random heroic VP to reach the weekly cap, but these new rewards may just make it worthwhile to tank several heroics a day when I am bored, instead of spending that time mindlessly kicking up dirt(archaeology)</div></div><hr />

O wait<br />
<br />
The emblems of valor is 7 times a week in patch. You can do your weeks worth of randoms in one day now instead of each day. The blizz post says you can do call to arms as much as we want so no limit on satchels.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Working as intended then? If there's a surplus of dpsers in the queue then they'll never be in demand; however the intent of this CtA is to make queue times fall to reasonable times for dps. If it does that then the surface issue is solved. The deeper issue is the ratio of tanks to healers to dps, but that's something that isn't easy to resolve as-is.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;OMG you mean I don't get a chance at a farmable/AH buyable/easily-obtained item thru dungeon queues because I'm like the majority of WoW players and role'd a DPS and not heals/tank? Man, Blizz is a bitch!&quot; (makes me remember all the ppl that would QQ at me in /w in BC coz I could herb in flight form and they had to dismount...) Simply said - you want the happy bag - you gotta qualify for it...kinda reminds me of real life. You want to be a doctor? Well you have to qualify for it.<br />
<br />
Get over it. There are worse things that could happen.<br />
<br />
Blizzard has already equalized this game WAAAY too much over the years anyway. Like EVERY class has an AoE now, classes that have NOTHING to do with being anything near a healer have abilities that can heal themselves...you get the picture. They throw this helping hand out there and it's like a wrench in the system JUST BECAUSE OF A STUPID BAG THAT WILL MOST LIKELY ONLY CONTAIN A LITTLE BIT OF EXTRA GOLD!!!! <br />
<br />
That's the funniest part in all of this. People aren't keeping in mind that these bags will probably only contain, and this is just a wild guess here, anywhere between like 20-30g and maybe a gem (which are cheap anyway) or a useless green item that will sell for 8-20g more or get DE'd. So that's potentially 50g or a gem...Unless you're a complete fucking tard, it takes all of like 20min (and sometimes not even that long) to make a whole 50g - and gems are easily bought/prospected.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, it looks like Blizz has bent over for some of you whiny DPS'ers and made the items BoA - so you can make a REALLY bad tank or healer, slop your way thru a dungeon for 2hrs while ppl die/rotate out of the group...get your mount that you probably don't really deserve and then just mail it to your precious mage/rogue or w/e you play that can't tank or heal.<br />
<br />
There's always a loophole...find it before you shit your pants over stupid things like this.</div></div><hr />

no, unfortunately most people are queue whores and all they care about is times - its the queueing system itself that is flawed and this &quot;fix&quot; wont actually fix anything other than degenerate the game into an even bigger joke than it already is.<br />
<br />
Two months affter they do this people will be moaning about queue times again, you'll see.<br />

rated bg storyline<br />
<br />
both horde and alliance realise they need to be able to practice killing each other. so they practice with others from their own faction. very violently.. there's your lore<br />
<br />
and under hellscreams new regime if you are an undead and kill an orc, you can guarantee you will be booted from the horde or permakilled by him, so no - your story is crap</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just had someone queue into a random dungeon as a tank. He was a Paladin in nearly full PVP Holy gear with a Prot spec. He had 65k mana with 2 items that didn't have Stam/Int on them and one strength DPS trinket. When we asked him why he had an agility weapon and healing gear on as a tank, he said &quot;I'm still getting gear.&quot; and proceeded to run, alone I might add, into the group of enemies as the other 3 people in the group stood back with me and watched him die in a quarter of a second. We told him that he shouldn't be queuing as a tank without having any tank gear at all and he had a fit. We kicked him out and one of the other people left, just to be replaced with a Warlock that had a +130 Agility enchant on his staff that pulled 2k DPS and couldn't figure out how to face enemies to cast.<br />
<br />
That story=awesome! couldn't stop laughing</div></div><hr />

erm, the reason there are wait times is because one faction has more players than the other, how could it not fix the queue? also the lore for bgs is already retarded, ie: we need to bravely run into the alliance building 3 times and steal their flag.... *steal their flag*, i'm sure that's just as important as making sure deathwing doesn't blow up the world.</div></div><hr />

Dunno if this has been answered yet , but my thought is that it only counts for the Valor points you get with a random. otherwise I dont see People in the desired roles join more then usual.</div></div><hr />

Objective of the game is to get the mounts as fast as possible so you can then go back to hanging out in SW/Org again so the DPS cry.</div></div><hr />

How are they gonna spin it? I can't imagine seeing some allaince start bg's in the horde base, or vice versa just seems very wrong.</div></div><hr />

Your payoff is shorter queue times. No more 40 min waits for your randoms. <br />
<br />
Tanks and Healers will get their goody bags as a reward for putting up with you guys. It's a fair tradeoff.</div></div><hr />
