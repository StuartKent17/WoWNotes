It's because of all the gold people stacked during wod and previous expansions. Mostly the gold during wod was thrown at us so people have huge stockpiles of it. That in turn has caused everything to be more expensive.</div></div><hr />

I disagree. While gold was easy to get in WoD, most people didn't bother. Many people don't have millions of gold, if even totaling 1 million across multiple toons. I agree with the person you quoted, blue gems drop to rarely (yes, yes, I know, blue = rare).</div></div><hr />

Yup, getting a rank 3 str flask is now taking me past 700 crafts. While the int one i proced rank 3 in about 10 crafts... agi flask took 4 crafts... something is wrong with this.</div></div><hr />

Alright, so redesign them like you did with other things. Also, the most challenging dungeons I've ever done were probably during Vanilla. The group's &quot;control&quot; was more important than any other expansion - position, crowd control, threat, pulling, damage priority, etc. TBC dungeons were tough for a while, too, along with those three ICC ones in Wrath. Those are the first that come to mind.</div></div><hr />

it took me over 1500 crafts to get the rank 3 int flask, it took me just under 600 crafts for the rank 3 agility flask, it took more than 2000 crafts for the rank 3 strength flask, i still don't have the stamina one at rank 3 yet and i'm approaching 1200 crafts for that flask type (i'm the guild alchemist hence my large numbers), and even considering my role, i have still spent millions on herbs myself to try and get these recipes faster, i have all the potions at rank 3, don't yet have spirit cauldron at rank 3, even after crafting ~100 of them since they were added, and i haven't bothered wasting any mats on making the &quot;flavour&quot; potions cos they are simply not worth the gold to craft at all, and certainly not worth the time to farm the mats needed, the only useful one of those is saggldrynk, and even then is very niche due to being used for M+ and not really anywhere outside that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
to be honest with you, i highly doubt they will add the timewalking tech to classic dungeons, for several reasons, mainly because firstly they have cut back on so many class abilities, many of the fights in these dungeons would actually be mathematically impossible if they were tuned properly to be &quot;like they used to be&quot;, and this point applies to timewalking raids too, they have cut so many abilities that many bosses in older raids are just plain unkillable as a result, secondly there is the issue with doing something like this in a queue-able group that requires so much setup and control, don't forget the vast majority of the playerbase today has no knowledge of what it was like back in times of yore, and even if they did, there's so many dungeons now that are nowhere near what they were like back in the day that it's not a proper experience.<br />
<br />
and yeah, i agree with you about the 3.3 dungeons being the last truly &quot;hard&quot; dungeons they added to the game, even cataclysm release dungeons weren't hard even though the usual minority screamed they were etc, and since then blizz have made dungeons so asinine and boring snoozefests it's not even funny.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;Archaeology got a time gated quest line, Fishing got an Artifact fishing pole, First Aid got items that drop out in the world.&quot; Archaeology is ok, Artifact fishing pole is beyond useless (for me..got it, levelled it and looks nice in my bank..) First aid just made it levelling pain in the ass and anyway..any1 using 1. aid for anything? (beyond CoS? even there the healer can &quot;use&quot; it anyway...)<br />
<br />
&quot;The randomness with Nomi is probably a little bit too random.&quot; Liitle bit? LITTLE BIT? Fuck you...<br />
<br />
&quot;While the team was building the profession quest lines they leaned on dungeons because they could scale.&quot; Sending into a mythic only dungeon to be able to craft 815 ilvl items...smart....</div></div><hr />

There really needs to be a way for people to incrementally increase the power of crafted gear so that you can at least keep it on par with the raid progression you've made. Something like a drop from bosses which is used to upgrade crafted gear appropriately (normal, heroic, mythic). Limit it to 1 or 2 crafted items equipped. And you can use the obliterum concept to make it so that you don't waste an item because RNGesus gives you a better boss drop. Obliterate your old crafted item and use it to get a slightly less powerful item for a different slot.<br />

It's rank 3. If it were rank 1 I would agree, but rank 3... I have no problem wrapping these around other aspects of the game. In most cases I've seen rank 3 just saves you a small few mats -- nothing significant.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Vanilla dungeons, aside from a few that have already been redone and don't really exist in their old form, were tuned for the level they were appropriate for. There was no high-level BFD for example. BC and LK, and every expansion, has had dungeons that already exist in two difficulties, normal and heroic, with heroic being tuned for max level of that expansion. It's easier to tune TW stuff around that because the dungeon itself doesn't need a lot of tuning, and instead it's about making sure that you are synced down to a level/stat level that is appropriate for that difficulty. It means less work because most of it was already done. Vanilla dungeons, on the other hand, mostly had a single difficulty, and tuned a decade ago. Any vanilla dungeon that got extra work, such as The Deadmines or Scholomance are out because of the statement Blizzard made today about wanting to include dungeons from the new area, not reworked vanilla stuff. <br />
<br />
Also, you seem mad about all of this. You should probably relax a bit, designers do this for a living, and while they certainly can't sit there and give you access to all of the e-mails and meeting minutes to explain the minutiae of every single decision, understand that a lot of thought goes in to decisions. It isn't arbitrary.</div></div><hr />

I would much prefer to equip an entire set of 865 crafted gear, than only be able to equip 2 that go up to raid quality. it's not meant to be raid quality, it's meant to get replaced by raid quality, to then be upgraded later, when possible.</div></div><hr />

It's easier to tune TW stuff around that because the dungeon itself doesn't need a lot of tuning, and instead it's about making sure that you are synced down to a level/stat level that is appropriate for that difficulty. It means less work because most of it was already done. Vanilla dungeons, on the other hand, mostly had a single difficulty, and tuned a decade ago. Any vanilla dungeon that got extra work, such as The Deadmines or Scholomance are out because of the statement Blizzard made today about wanting to include dungeons from the new area, not reworked vanilla stuff. <br />
<br />
Also, you seem mad about all of this. You should probably relax a bit, designers do this for a living, and while they certainly can't sit there and give you access to all of the e-mails and meeting minutes to explain the minutiae of every single decision, understand that a lot of thought goes in to decisions. It isn't arbitrary.<br />
<br />
aham because the difference between a normal and hc dungeon is tremendous... new bosses, new mechanics, etc..ohh wait, no...bigger healthpool and damage...yeah kinda hard to to do it...<br />
<br />
No offense but the TW dungeons tuned for god knows what, but 100% not the original hc.... <br />
<br />
And those designers and developers...they are not doing too good job, do they? I mean I`m working for my salary as well, but if i try to do such a low level, &quot;don`t give a fuck&quot; result in the end....well, i would not stay long in my workplace....They fucked up...big time, not the first nor the second and i`m sure not the last time either. I could not care less about how easy or hard is the job what they are doing (especially because no such a thing exist &quot;too hard job&quot;..just lack of necessary and relevant knowledge, experience, assets, skills....for example: to run 10km is easy, hard or impossible task? Or is it based on personal skills and abilities? Same with everything..they sucks because of lack of the mentioned traits and/or natural intelligence) but it`s their job to fix...I know I can vote with my wallet and hell I`m gonna do that....</div></div><hr />

For example, in expansions other than WoD we've seen blue gems become cheap on the market after a few months, and potions and flasks have always been negligibly expensive. Now 1 potion of the old war goes for around 700g on my server - which even accounting for inflation was not the case in Wrath, Cata, or MoP. I've prospected hundreds and hundreds of stacks of ore all this expansion too and the yield of blue gems seems far below what it was in MoP, Cata, or Wrath. It's more than just the garrison.<br />
<br />
lol what? no, i remember i couldent raid in our main team back in wrath because i was too younge to use the AH enough to afford pots and flasks, i was given the spare ones and was on our second team for mosto f the expansion, they were super expensive</div></div><hr />

I suggest you take another look at some of the dungeons. A good hard look. Eck was Heroic only. Blood Guard Porung, for all he was worth, was Heroic only. Second boss in Vortex Pinnacle has a bunch of Tornados which throw you in the air which don't exist in Normal mode. <br />
<br />
Pandaria dungeons is where most of the Normals were identical to Heroic (for obvious reasons) save Scarlet Monastery where Whitemane gained a resurrect everyone spell, but the differences were actually between Heroic and Challenge mode mechanic wise.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;The crafted gear has a limited duration. As more content is added to the game, higher item level loot is added elsewhere.&quot;<br />
<br />
I chime in with you.... And say yeah crafted gear has a duration. I'd say the duration is zero. I see no reason to make any of it except to turn in for a quest. Its almost been this since day one. <br />
<br />
The reason is either they can't figure it out.... Or better yet I bet its &quot;raid or die&quot; for Blizzard.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Murderdoll</div><div class="date">2017-01-13, 06:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's because of all the gold people stacked during wod and previous expansions. Mostly the gold during wod was thrown at us so people have huge stockpiles of it. That in turn has caused everything to be more expensive.<br />
<br />
I would largely agree with this, but certainly isnt the only reason.<br />
<br />
The incredibly large costs of Feasts, Flasks and Pots come from a number of sources.<br />
<br />
a) Incredible Inflation. Through passively doing Garrisons last expansion, most raiders have a very healthy gold total. People with alts, even more so. Gold is literally garbage at this point and with the lack of meaningful BoE's this expansion there wasnt enough goldsinks.<br />
<br />
b) The Materials. A large number of recipes take the same fucking herbs. Fjarhbsjkjkbfdjkbdf and Foxflower are in such demand due to their overuse. Then factor in Starlight Rose and then factor in the ranking system.<br />
<br />
c) No Flying/Difficult Map terrain. Highmountain and Stormheim are aids.<br />
<br />
d) Less bot activity. Bots keep prices down, simple.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hunters: Lore mentioned that class tuning hotfixes are coming soon, including for Hunters!<br />
<br />
WTF is PTR even for at this point? Bugs still make it through, class balance is apparently an afterthought and when you can literally dump changes onto classes without testing them the night before the entire thing becomes redundant.</div></div><hr />

&quot;There isn't a lot of profit margin in crafting, but having the Rank 3 recipes help to give players a little more profit.&quot;<br />
<br />
You lose money under rank 3 in the AH... There is no profit. So what will players do? You have to fnd people who have the rank 3 and craft thousands of stuff with them and sell it. I don't even understand how Blizzard thought it is a good idea. <br />
For example: there is no point for alchemy leveling at this point. Get a friend who has those recipes. Done.</div></div><hr />

The thing is they didnt &quot;nerf&quot; the bracers. only popping 6 sores is great, same or more dmg and have 2 sores to burst after. Did you even test the DK after patch? Or just decided to quit after just reading.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Did you seriously think they'd get it all done? They said not too long ago they wouldn't even get to Warlocks until after this patch, they have a LOT of work left to do, seemingly. They're dumping changes because they ran out of time. Celestalon and his team fucked up big time. Lore and the other CMs will spin that everything is fine, nothing to see here, but they're still developing Legion, months after release. This work should have been done by release, but it was so much work, rebuilding all the classes, that it was doomed to fail anyway. <br />
<br />
And next expansion, they'll do it all over again. Job security, doncha know. Hell, if Holinka can keep his job after his major fuck ups, I guess Celestalon isn't going anywhere, so expect this and more, for the future. Class balance? LOL. Good luck with that, they're the furthest from &quot;balance&quot; that they've ever been, since vanilla. The best you can hope for is they won't fuck your class up too much between now and 7.2. <br />
<br />
I'm sure we'll get Ion trotted out in a couple of weeks saying &quot;they messed up, but we'll do better next time - promise!&quot;</div></div><hr />

&quot;The Vanilla dungeons don't hold up to current dungeon design standards, which is why they didn't start with Vanilla timewalking. They don't feel challenging and aren't tuned for max-level players.&quot;<br />

<br />
Also the crafted gear is just recolored versions of existing gear so there is barely a reason to craft even from transmog purposes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't get this. Legion was billed as letting lots of different preferred play styles progress how they want. PvP, Dungeons, World Quests, everything can gear a person long term, especially with the Titanforge system. It is possible to gear entirely to something like 880 without ever touching a dungeon or raid thanks to world quests.<br />
<br />
Yet professions are forced into other content instead, and it wildly variable too. I got along just fine Blacksmithing with a few casual dungeons, yet I am forced into a Mythic dungeon for Engineering (and quickly met a wave of the exact type of people that make me hate high difficulty mode content to begin with) to get the 815 helmet recipes which are the only feasible a chance to reach 800 (only other recipe possible is the RIDICULOUSLY expensive to craft Trigger)</div></div><hr />

<br />
If anything, I want them to create 2 &quot;categories&quot; of running events. They should return the old specific battleground events (Anyone remember AV weekends? Great times. Love to queue specific BGs I love without getting 2 hours queues) and create a PvP Weekly Event category (Remove Arena Skirmish week from current and put it in with the BGs) and have both a PvE and PvP event going every week. So when you're a player of one/hater of the other, you aren't looking at your calendar counting down the weeks until you get the PvP event you want, or vice versa. This will also help speed up the rotation of the weekly events, so a player who wants something like Battle Pet Week will only have to wait maybe 4 weeks at most, instead of potentially 6+ as the event pool will be smaller. So it ends up like<br />
<br />
Week 1:<br />
PvE - Battle Pet<br />
PvP - Arena Skirmish<br />
<br />
Week 2:<br />
PvE - Timewalking<br />
PvP - Alterac Valley<br />
<br />
etc. Something for both PvE and PvP players every week, faster event rotation so you're not waiting 2 months for your favourite one, etc.</div></div><hr />
