The Encounter Journal is finally on the test realms and even if it isn't finished we finally know how much information we will get from it: a lot. The Firelands raid encounters are already there and it looks like Blizzard really wants you to know where you're going before you enter a raid, see the screenshots below.  
 
I also added a small video preview from OMFGCata because every time I forget to post a video from Jesse, a puppy gets sad.

If you're still wondering how much info you can get for a single fight, check the preview of the Ragnaros encounter below. Everything in the preview (except for the picture, I guess) is from the Encounter Journal and not a single bit of it is from extra datamining. <br />

Ragnaros - Encounter Journal Preview (Heroic Version)<br />
Ragnaros, lord of the Firelands, embodies the fury and destruction of the promordial infernos that forged Azeroth itself. Promised the chance to set Azeroth aflame without interference from Neptulon and Therazane, Ragnaros seeks to appease the Old Gods by incinerating the World Tree of Nordrassil.<br />

He has legs now. Who knew?<br />

I mean a raid instance is great, but what about the other time I'm not raiding? I'd personally like to see more world events, interaction among players, daily and solo content than &quot;Here's a heroic encounter that's super complex and hard that most people wont even bother to do!&quot; It just feels like they're wasting their time on the wrong kind of content.</div></div><hr />

Until now. With the introduction of the Encounter Journal they're clearly changing their whole take on these things. I think the reasoning goes &quot;the only ones who the secrecy matters for are a dozen of guilds going for world firsts. Everyone else, that is, 99.99% of the WoW subscriber base, will have access to this information from wowhead anyway by the time they even consider reaching it. Catering for the fun of 00.01% or for the 99.99%... let's see...&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
Reading through the phase 4 mechanics I doubt that it's possible. Without Cenarius Superheated would stack infinitly and become unhealable at some point. Without Hamuul Ragnaros won't be stunned and he won't take additional damage, probably giving problems with an enrage. And without Malfurion you can't extinguish the dreadflames - so it seems the flames will be there forever if not extinguished. <br />
<br />
Achievements maybe, but I doubt it seriously (then again - I DO jave no idea how the fight works, but it sounds at least impossible from reading this spells).<br />
<br />
Nevertheless, the fight sounds extremely awesome. Same goes for Alysrazor. All fights sound interesting, but it depends on how the fight works.</div></div><hr />

Unfortunatly I don't think that is possible.<br />
You should be able to do it without Cenarius resulting in you having to kite the Living Meteors for the rest of the fight and you will take increasing amounts of damage from superheated.<br />
However missing Malfurion Stormrage is already impossible I think. It would result in the entire field being filled with Dreadflames pretty quickly. But it might just be possible if dps is super high and depending on who long the last phase lasts.<br />
But missing Hamuul Runetotem makes the fight impossible. Read the ability called Empower Sulfuras again. That's a freaking 500k damage to everyone and the only way I can see you can interrupt that is by stunning him in the Entrapping Roots.<br />

You mean... your 'fun aspect' came from wiping a million times on a boss in order to see his next ability?<br />
I don't think that's fun.<br />
<br />
Oh wait, you mean your 'fun aspect' was &quot;/rw Okay everyone take 5 and go youtube the fight.&quot;<br />
<br />
Oh! No no no! Your 'fun aspect' was &quot;WTF JUST HIT ME?!&quot;<br />
<br />
=\<br />
I love the encounter Journal. It gives you a list of the boss's attacks. People typically do that with wowhead or something anyway.<br />
It's not like the information on what he does wouldn't become immediately available as soon as someone killed it.<br />
These are attacks, however, not strats.<br />
<br />
I think the encounter journal will be a nice deterrent from &quot;youtube it.&quot;<br />
It makes more sense, honestly.<br />
The 'fun factor' doesn't come in figuring out what the boss does - it comes from figuring out how to work around it.<br />
It will give people like me an easier-to-access database of what the boss does, without the added temptation of looking at fight breakdowns via youtube or wowhead.<br />
<br />
It'll allow me and my guild full creative control when designing our strats. We won't feel 'limited' to do what's &quot;proven&quot; to work by paragon and others.<br />
<br />
The fun part is formulating a strategy, and executing it. if it works, great! If not, work on it! <br />
Wiping is just tedious clicky-runny work.<br />
That's just my opinion though.</div></div><hr />

Well, it's not even casual raiders or non-raiders, just stuff to do in the game outside of raiding. Even hardcore guilds clear the content pretty fast, no matter how complex or difficult it is. There's only 7 bosses in the new instance and a phased hub for dailies. Most of the dailies are repetitive and kind of boring (I've been on the ptr even though my wow sub isn't active and watched the ptr streams.) Majority of the content on the ptr just seems rather bland and boring. It's not really a casual verses hardcore debate (As I've always been a fairly hardcore player, having been in both Deus Vox before it died and a few other hardcore guilds.), I just wish they would spend the time they put into making this &quot;super awesome extreme boss fight&quot; giving players something to do outside raiding. I'm just saying I wish they would put more effort into designing more content in a whole rather than tunnel-visioning on this one fight and using it as &quot;the super awesome selling point that will make this raid so amazing!&quot;</div></div><hr />

&quot;You mistake this implementation as a walk-through. While you will be told the items and abilities the boss will employ, it will not tell you when, how much damage, where to stand etc. This is merely an extra in-game tool to help players get into the encounters, understand them a little better, and enjoy them. The ability to take down the boss is still soundly within player hands and abilities.&quot;<br />

--------------------------<br />
<br />
Stage 1:<br />
<br />
Much like original Ragnaros in Molten Core.<br />
<br />
Differences: <br />
<br />
- The Lava Wave created from Sulfuras Smash is now dodgeable (think Sartharion Flame Walls, only these Walls ripple outwards in all directions from the point of impact).<br />
- Magma Trap is a new ability. Players should be mindful of not standing in locations that could create a line of Magma Traps that would otherwise limit your ability to move freely around Ragnaros' platform (as these apparently persist for &quot;the remainder of the battle&quot;).<br />
<br />
Intermission1:<br />
<br />
Like the original Ragnaros, he submerges and creates Fire Elementals. <br />
<br />
Differences:<br />
<br />
-Instead of Fire Elementals spawning and aggro'ing onto players, they fixate on Sulfuras (think Lady Vashj Stage 2 Water Elementals). Set up fixed positions for DPS and healers around the platform to deny the Sons of Flame. (I imagine they spawn outside the ring of land you're standing on and make their way to the center where Sulfuras sits)<br />
<br />
Stage 2:<br />
<br />
Ragnaros maintains his Sulfuras Smash/Lava Wave, but now has more abilities.<br />
<br />
Ideas:<br />
<br />
- Molten Seeds are much like Dragonhawk boss in ZA. They explode after 10 seconds, leaving plenty of time for the entire raid to shift one way or the other. In doing so, you can funnel all Molten Elementals in one direction which will make it easy for tanks to pick them up. Depending on how intense the Molten Power buff (reminiscent of ToGC Anub'arak's Spider Frenzy on adds) is, how far the Elementals must be from each other, and how wide the land ring is, that will determine if the raid can all shift in one direction following a Molten Inferno or if the raid must split: one half goes left with half of the Elementals, the other half goes right.<br />
- World in Flames could match up with when Molten Inferno occurs making the movement laid out above even more critical.<br />
<br />
Intermission2:<br />
<br />
Same as the first Intermission with the exception of Lava scions spawning.<br />
<br />
Ideas: <br />
<br />
- Again, if fixed positions are assigned to a perimeter around Sulfuras and the DPS are capable of bringing down the Sons of Flame in their quadrant with minimal assistance, Blazing Heat is less of an issue. If the Sons of Flame have a substantial amount of HP (i.e. more than 1 raider needed to take down in 10man or 3 in 25man), Blazing Heat's fire trail will have to be curled into itself (Lord Jaraxxus Fel Flame, BQL Swarming Shadows) and other DPS will have to adjust positions to account for where the Sons are spawning.<br />
<br />
Stage 3: (First Soft Enrage due to increasing amounts of Living Meteors spawned)<br />
<br />
Essentially Stage 2 minus the Molten Seed mechanic. It is replaced by the Living Meteor mechanic.<br />
<br />
Ideas:<br />
<br />
- Move around the platform in CW or CCW fashion as Living Meteors come down so they are always trailing you. They will essentially be &quot;kite killed&quot; by ranged DPS.<br />
<br />
Stage 4: (Second Soft Enrage due to Superheated stacking)<br />
<br />
A stage in its own right. Ragnaros no longer has any of the abilities he previously had in the fight and is now mobile.<br />
<br />
Ideas:<br />
<br />
- Again, due to Superheated being a persistent aura that stacks over time (BQL Shroud of Sorrow.. minus people healing themselves as vampires), this is his soft enrage mechanic. Max DPS.<br />
- Empower Sulfuras looks like it could be an ability similar to General Vezax's Surge of Darkness, meaning you have to kite Ragnaros when he Empowers Sulfuras. This may be a one-time Empower that lasts for the remainder of the fight.<br />
- Dreadflame is simply there to limit the region making kiting more difficult (Professor Putricide Ooze Puddles).<br />
- My guess is that when Ragnaros steps out of his lava pool, the lava dips (Laws of displacement?) and more of the room becomes traversable. Hence the need for an ability like Dreadflame to limit the room again.<br />
<br />
<br />
The Catch:<br />
<br />
Cenarius helps you during the fight.<br />
<br />
- Cenarius assists with Breadth of Frost (ice patches). Find them while kiting in both Stage 3 and 4 to severely dampen the Ragnaros' soft enrage abilities.<br />
<br />
Hamuul Runetotem helps out during Phase 4.<br />
<br />
- Hamuul will most likely place Entrapping Roots on the ground and you must kite/navigate Ragnaros towards them to trap him for additional damage/immobilization. This is reminiscent of Maiev's traps during the Illidan encounter(BT) or the Crystals against Ossirian the Unscarred (AQ20).<br />
<br />
Malfurion Stormrage offers Cloudbursts, allowing player(s) to mitigate Dreadflames.<br />
<br />
- Although they will probably only be temporary usage, I imagine when a player becomes a Cloudburst it is like becoming the Abomination on the Professor Putricide fight. Moving your Cloudburst over the Dreadflame pool may extinguish it instantly, or you may have to keep using &quot;Deluge&quot; on the Dreadflame pools to shrink them until they disappear completely.<br />
<br />

No more fun on new encounters where you do not know the spells. I would have nothing against the loottable or the story. But this is nearly a guide for everybody and it destroys the hardmode race....<br />
<br />
Be honest here. There's probably about 5 guilds in the world who down these encounters way before anyone else has even thought up a proper strategy. These then spread all over the internet in the form of kill videos, and nearly everyone proceeds to use these for their own raids. <br />
<br />
This feature won't change a thing about that, especially since it's merely an ability list, not a strategy guide. You can find all the info in the journal on wowpedia / wowhead during the PTR testing already, so... meh. It's been like this for years.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I call bullshit on this. Why? because boss abilities can already be clicked in the fights themselves. They appear in your chat, and a single click gives a full tooltip. And again, all the info on spells is already in various websites long before the fights go live. And if the info isn't there before it goes live, people have proven to be very resourceful on providing this before you can even say &quot;buffs plz&quot; and clear trash. :p<br />
<br />
Edit: the point I was trying to make with the ~ 5 guilds, was perhaps not very clear. I meant that those are the ones who actually put up videos that become widespread amongst the player base. Yes, there are more guilds who clear a lot of the fights fast, but they don't &quot;contribute&quot; as much in terms of how much info they spread on how they did the fights.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Cenarius, according to the stories, is the son of Malorne and YSERA. Hence why the Aspect when berserk in the Ancients trilogy when she saw Malorne slaughtered by the demons, and Cenarius wounded. =\<br />
<br />
<br />
Wrong, it was THOUGHT that she was his mother. Hell Malfurion thought they were dealing till he realised she treated Cenarius more like a favoured son than a lover. Ysera loved Malorne, but Malorne already had Cenariusafter fealing with Elune (still somewhat unconfirmed) so Ysera basically adopted Cenarius.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They are adding a massive daily hub in Hyjal along with this raid. Blizzard has to evenly pread out their content, It's also about time for new raids, as the previous tier is becoming stale. I don't think people would like to go 6 more months with Tier 11 content.</div></div><hr />

If we look at how long it took for Blizzard to add all of the old dungeon / raid maps, I doubt that this thing will hold anywhere near the amount of item information of Atlasloot. At least not anytime soon. (especially since it seems to be boss loot only at this point)</div></div><hr />

Did ya miss the part of a whole new zone with a massive, personally-progressed daily hub, that will likely take 1 month + to finish?<br />
<br />
As well, keep in mind, if Blizzard didn't break 4.1 off from the Firelands patch, we'd still be on 4.0.6, and testing everything that came in 4.1 ALONG WITH Firelands, with zero new content.<br />
<br />
We will be getting more content. They will likely do heroics + many new features in the intermediary patches between raid tier patches, unlike Wrath, that had far, far less content pushed (aside from the Tourney Dailies, we saw how much extra content outside of raids? 4 5-mans? Not too impressive. We are already getting a fair bit more in Wrath).</div></div><hr />

No more fun on new encounters where you do not know the spells. I would have nothing against the loottable or the story. But this is nearly a guide for everybody and it destroys the hardmode race....<br />
<br />
1st hardcore race start in ptr. they allready know all bosses and kill it very times way before they come to live. So this will not change nothint at all. If paragon did not kill all bosses in one week that was because they did not have gear enouth because they know all bosses way before.<br />
<br />
2nd If you don't want to know what boss do dont read. Like before this you do not read wowhead. <br />
<br />
3rd many ppl don't only read ability but check videos for strategys so this will not change that. Ppl still need to go to youtube or wowhead to share and read information. The only thing that change is that now you don't need to alt+tab to talk about onbe ability as RL or to check names.<br />
<br />
4rd This will be easly to update because because nerfs, buffs or fix on boss most of time are numbers and that will not be ingame and even if they change a lot one ability that they need to rework all text in journal they only need to make a small patch less then 10k with fix that can be download while you you play.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They talked about it at Blizzcon back in October, not sure if SW:TOR had announced the Codex then, but it's not a new idea. <br />
<br />
From the way they were talking in the Game Systems panel, Blizzard wants to add the functionality of many of the &quot;must have&quot; addons into the default UI over time. The Encounter Journal, paired with the dungeon maps, is essentially Atlas w/ Atlas Loot. We already got Power Auras, a Grid-like raid frame, etc... If those features are from other games as well, oh well, now they're in WoW too.</div></div><hr />

I agree its like the 1% of super special &quot;elitist&quot; show offs pay more to play this game than the other 99%? It's why they must cater to the smaller side of the player base, because they can OBVIOUSLY run the entire game off that &quot;enormous&quot; income.

<br />
Does anyone think, in a six year old game that people are willing to go back to the only 1% of guilds killing an end boss thing (heroic is end boss apparently now)?<br />
<br />
Maybe we should just all app top 3 server guilds, right?<br />
<br />
Seems very risky, time consuming and annoying to me. I want to stay loyal to this game after all these years and the friends I have met in it but damn... this is geting hard to do.<br />
<br />
LOl getting hard. Well my cupcake u must suck, and i dont care if u loose friends or quit. just stop sayin stuff is hard because games are suppose to be hard.. now go off to achivs or quit, cause to me u sound like a badie or what we call Causal player which is still bad period!!</div></div><hr />

If you don't want harder raids, what do you want? Adding daily quests can only go so far and what is the point of dailies really to begin with? Do you want more 5 mans? I honestly don't understand how anyone would want more of them considering how easy they almost always are if you are geared properly, and it would be really difficult to keep creating a huge number of interesting ones. <br />
<br />
Do you want easier raids? I honestly don't think any of the raids currently, on normal, are hard, AT ALL. I have been in horrible HORRIBLE guilds and I can understand how some guilds are having problems, but, why would you subject yourself to an environment like that? If it's purely because of friendships then there isn't much Blizzard can do about that. I guess they would have to make an even easier difficulty, but that's just like having 5 mans that are called 10/25 mans.</div></div><hr />

Encounter Journal seems kewl if I want to read up on a boss or would tell others to do so too. But I'll stick mostly with Atlas+Atlasloot, cuz the latter includes stuff from vendors, professions, holiday events n what not! Encounter Journal would have to get at least as extensive n fast to navigate as Atlasloot for me to start using Encounter Journal only.<br />

<br />
It seems to me that in this game, once people attempt something for a week or so (or some other short time period) and can't do it, they give up, then throw up their arms and say it's too hard and it's for &quot;elitists&quot; only.<br />
<br />
What ever happened to challenge? Oh that's right, &quot;challenge&quot; has become synonymous with &quot;elitist&quot; in this game. I'm in a 10man guild and we raid once a week, MAYBE two, and we're 6/13 hardmodes.<br />
<br />
Really, if you guys spent time trying to overcome challenge instead of sitting on the forums pointing fingers, maybe you'd get somewhere. If the game was easy, there would be no challenge, and there would be no fun. If WoW is too hard for you and your guild, in my opinion you're playing the wrong game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Which was only a month after the lead game producer announced at GDC that players were moving through the content slower than expected. Morhaime is full of shit and just trying to appease investors. Investors won't know about that GDC comment but they definitely know about Morhaime's one.<br />
<br />
Anyways the DJ isn't really gonna have an effect on anyone except the very first guilds who try to knock over encounters and maybe make it a little easier for the first few who follow after them to get the information from the DJ instead of watching videos and searching the spell database. If anything, I'm hoping Blizzard takes this as a queue to make sure the challenge of the fight relies on the execution and not the gimmicks. Design the fights so that knowing just lets you make attempts without spending the first hour or two figuring out whats going on, but rather figuring out how to execute it.</div></div><hr />

Wow.. really? You're the type of player that gives casuals a bad name. I'm not sure why you seem to think players wanting challenges in WoW makes them automatic elitists. Because it doesn't, just FYI.<br />
<br />
Back to the main subject. I think the Encounter Journal is a good idea. It doesn't ruin anything at all and I really cannot believe some people are crying about this being implemented. Just seeing boss abilities doesn't make the fight a joke. I mean look at heroic LK25. People knew every single ability for that fight yet it took many many guilds months to kill him. <br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
This is just to give people who said the Encounter Journal doesn't provide enough information from which to generate loose strategies:<br />
- Magma Trap is a new ability. Players should be mindful of not standing in locations that could create a line of Magma Traps that would otherwise limit your ability to move freely around Ragnaros' platform (as these apparently persist for &quot;the remainder of the battle&quot;).<br />
<br />
I suspect we have to alternate members to eat the trap.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
- Move around the platform in CW or CCW fashion as Living Meteors come down so they are always trailing you. They will essentially be &quot;kite killed&quot; by ranged DPS.<br />
<br />
Depends, it might use the prince setback council's mechanics in ICC.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
- Hamuul will most likely place Entrapping Roots on the ground and you must kite/navigate Ragnaros towards them to trap him for additional damage/immobilization. This is reminiscent of Maiev's traps during the Illidan encounter(BT) or the Crystals against Ossirian the Unscarred (AQ20).<br />
<br />
Oh raggy, what big legs you got?<br />

yet its not needed havent used any &quot;raid encounter tools&quot; since ulduar and i rarely ask for a strat or look on wowhead i just learn it, anyway its like any fight they are not bringing much new to the table these day, they have done it all already.</div></div><hr />

What a game.<br />

Great addition by Blizzard. If they put in the full details of the current content and previous tiers, there's no reason for new people not to know the encounters. It should speed up loot distribution for some guilds too. When it really comes down to it, the first week the content is out the top level guilds will have strats up on youtube anyhow, so there's really no negative there. Just goes to show nothing lives up to the standards of the QQ brigade. Blizzard does a great job of listening to the bulk of their community, not just the vocal minority.</div></div><hr />

I honestly don't think super hard complex raid fights are what wow needs right now. Not that difficult fights are a bad thing, I'm all for challenging raid content -- I just believe that they should put more effort into actually putting out more content that's interesting. I mean a raid instance is great, but what about the other time I'm not raiding? I'd personally like to see more world events, interaction among players, daily and solo content than &quot;Here's a heroic encounter that's super complex and hard that most people wont even bother to do!&quot; It just feels like they're wasting their time on the wrong kind of content.<br />
You mean aside from the new questzone with 60 dailies that uses phasing as you progress building a huge tree to claim parts of fireland? Yeah..</div></div><hr />

<br />
So you basically being carried by your other 9/24 guildmates, by not knowing where to stand, what to do if you got the X debuff/buff or what is your mission for a given encounter, and they still keeping you in the guild,and you want us to believe it, and this is the right thing to do?<br />
<br />
Ok seems logical yeah indeed,ofc,sure.<br />
<br />
<br />
I am confused how people see this is as a bad thing? People do realize before you were relying on some bubba to update a add-on every patch and now blizzard does it for you. It has been there for as long as even I was playing WoW and I stopped a long time ago.<br />
<br />
Don't bother people will whine, they need no reason for it, it's like a baby, it doesn't need a reason to start crying, he will cry if he wants even if you give him a shiny sugar ball.<br />
<br />
The people who are saying this is bad or whatever it's like 5-10 people that already using BW/DBM,Atlasloot (i bet my right hand that they used AugReal addon that was banned) and reading/watching tactics on youtube,wowhead, they just want you to flame them and quote their posts because they are lifeless little beings that got nothing constructive to post, so they are trying to feel somewhat important by flaming.<br />
<br />
They will even whine if Blizzard release their map addon to replace mapster etc.<br />
You'll get used to it the forums is full of them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Which is?<br />
<br />
If you thinks the dungeon journal will trivialize boos encounters then i think you are wrong. Tell me when did you fiddle around boss abilities and/or develop counter tactics to boss abilities or tactics how to avoid them in your raid? The major bulk of raiders read and copy tactics from other raids that did the work for them. If you are one of this raids who develop tactics for encounters - then don't use the journal - nothing changes for you.<br />
<br />
For me - it will cost less time to explain a new raid member how the encounter works - ich can tell him RTFJ - read the f*cking journal to know about the boss abilities.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">krelios</div><div class="date">2011-05-16, 11:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;As well&quot; ? The quest hub is the solo/daily content - which is useless for 2/3 of the community.<br />
<br />
This just in. Quests and content that everyone can do when they reach the new area provided in the patch are useless to 2/3 of the community! ZOMGTRUFAX!<br />
Come on, making up random BS doesn't help you argument, especially when it's demonstrably wrong.</div></div><hr />

One of the &quot;fun&quot; things about raiding, is actually finding out what abilities are being cast, what they actually and how much damage cause...</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am so screwed.....even with a 90k mana base, 6 years as a holy/disc priest I won't keep up.... why Blizzard can't update the fiend to todays demands in mana regin is beyond me did they just miss the boat on this? or is someone just thinking they hate healers that much?</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;oh but it screws over top guilds&quot; - no. it does not. period. these guilds know where to find this information anyways. less alt tabbing = moar /1 foolishness!<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;but it screws over pugs&quot; - far from it, sure mr pro rogue knows about major ability X but can't figure out why he's dying. NOW HE DOES! godspeed young pve hero.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;totally screws over strats&quot; - um. no. you got your strat from the top guild on your server/continent's video on youtube. they got their strat from working hard. also because they had info like this. info that was available anyways. theres more than one way to skin a cat, and some cats just scratch less.<br />
<br />
&quot;500k damage to the entire raid how am i expected to heal/live/dance/teabag??!?!&quot; go look at the chimaeron normal numbers (yes, you can find them!) they seem a bit retarded, but once you put all the mechanics together, it makes sense, so does/will rag. do your job and listen to your raid leader. theres cake!<br />
<br />
as a long time raid leader of a small group of RL friends (outside of my 25 guild). not only do i have to know strats, but i have to know tips to give the healers, tanks, the special warlock who always shows up 20 minutes late. knowing what to look out for and how to find it isn't impossible, but not always in the same place for every fight. this is everything i need, without having to sit alt tabbed and switch back every two seconds to see if someone without a mic asked me a question, in one place.<br />
<br />
thank you blizz. you have helped my raid leading tool box, and hopefully helped my ten man side project be more aware of fire, except for the warlock.</div></div><hr />
