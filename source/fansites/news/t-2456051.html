World Of Warcraft: Greek Community Q&amp;A with Ion Hazzikostas<br />
Game Director of World of Warcraft, Ion Hazzikostas, answered some previously submitted questions from the Greek World of Warcraft Community. Video courtesy of Enternity.gr (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCO-DK9xFeDXbGOTLmzpgBIw).<br />

&lt;iframe width=&quot;900&quot; height=&quot;506&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/894fSjZTWz8&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;<br />
<br />
Mythic+ Dungeons<br />
<br />
Ideally each path of endgame progression will have unique benefits and rewards. <br />
Gear swapping in Mythic+ is something the team thought about changing during Legion, but didn't want to do in the middle of an expansion. <br />
The team views a Mythic+ dungeon like a single boss encounter, which is why you can't change talents or respec in the middle of the dungeon. Choices are more interesting when you are weighing the entire range of situations that the dungeon is going to offer. <br />
If you are just gearing for a specific boss or pull, those choices are fairly easy. You just collect the right gear and set up macros to swap as you go. <br />
Your gameplay should be more important than having the right gear swapping macros set up.<br />
<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
<br />
The team would like to have space in the game for sustained pressure, with DoT classes wearing down the healers, giving a burst class a chance to jump in and get the kill. Weakness in one area should be made up with strengths in another. If you are less mobile, you should be harder to kill. If you have high mobility, you should probably go down more easily if people are able to focus on you. <br />
The team would rather focus on increasing strengths rather than mitigating weaknesses. Always bolstering weaknesses makes everyone more average at everything.<br />
<br />
<br />
Stat Squish<br />
<br />
The team doesn't think they will need to do another stat squish for another expansion, and certainly not during this one. <br />
With the work that the team has done for the Battle for Azeroth stat squish, it should be easier to do it in the future, with far fewer bugs and issues. The team did a one time rework of every creature and ability in the game for Battle for Azeroth, converting them to a system that allows an easy 30% nerf under the hood. Now it is just changing one number and everything should just work. <br />
Stat squishes help to keep numbers from getting out of control while still providing for power gain over an expansion. <br />
The team doesn't have a great solution to avoid having to do stat squishes in the future. <br />
<br />
<br />
The Return of Classic Buffs<br />
<br />
There is something nice about getting buffed up before a pull, it's almost ceremonial. It feels like you are powering up to go into a fight.<br />
The buffs also have a social element and make people stronger in a raid than they would be on their own. <br />
The buffs also gave some classes that could use some extra utility an extra reason to be brought. <br />
Paladins and Druids traditionally had raid buffs, but in the Battle for Azeroth environment, they already had plenty of utility. <br />
The team would rather focus on the unique and strong utility that Druids and Paladins already bring rather than adding more buffs if they feel that there isn't incentive to bring these classes.<br />
<br />
<br />
Loot Systems<br />
<br />
Loot used to be much harder to come by, with guilds clearing old bosses over and over because loot was rarer. <br />
Drop rates are now higher, there is personal loot, trading loot, bonus rolls, and other opportunities to get loot. The team expects players will get the loot that they want from a raid within a couple of months of doing that tier. <br />
It's very rare to actually go a meaningful amount of time into a raid tier without getting the items that you want.<br />
Warforging and Titanforging add some level of interest to repeated clears of a raid. <br />
You might have been doing Uldir for a couple of months at this point. There is still a chance to earn something interesting and gain more power to keep progressing in the raid. <br />
The team doesn't want players to feel obligated to go back and clear lower difficulties every week for the rare chance that something might be an upgrade. <br />
Most players aren't feeling forced to go back and clear lower difficulties anymore. In Legion, set pieces were a reason to go back to try and get upgrades, but the game has moved away from tier sets. <br />
It's up to players to choose where to spend their time, and what is most rewarding. You are better off doing Mythic+ than going back to lower raid difficulties for a slim chance at an upgrade. <br />
<br />
<br />
Personal Loot<br />
<br />
Overall, the team is happy with how Personal Loot is working out so far. <br />
The best geared raid groups are still the ones doing the hardest content.<br />
The benefits to removing personal loot are three things:<br />
<br />
On the lower end, there are lots of guilds that churn through a steady stream of trials. Historically, guilds wouldn't give trials any loot, causing them to not have any progression. <br />
On the highest end, there are guilds running multiple groups in parallel that would funnel loot to specific characters using Master Loot. This made it 4-5x faster to gear up compared to regular groups that were just doing one run. This led to more and more guilds to start running split raids. <br />
Split raids made it difficult to balance raids for everyone, as the top end guilds were overgeared compared to average guilds. <br />
If you want to be competitive and try for the Top 100, you can just focus on gearing up your main roster and maybe some backups rather than running split raids. <br />
The team is able to itemize differently with Personal Loot. With Master Loot, the team had to design loot tables that didn't have niche items that would only be useful to a spec or two. Now the team can better cater to a wider range of itemization, with more fist weapons, range weapons, shields, and more. <br />
For tight knit social groups that weren't abusing any of this, there is something that was lost with these changes. <br />
The change for the game as a whole is a step in the right direction. Once you are past the first few weeks of a new raid tier, tradability helps offset these changes. <br />
<br />
The team is trying to make item level a better guide for what is an upgrade.<br />
Personal Loot is here to stay, so let's talk about how we can improve it rather than rolling it back to Master Loot. <br />
<br />
<br />
Ranked PvP<br />
<br />
Battle for Azeroth Ranked PvP has worked out well so far, as there is a clear progression system. <br />
Unranked PvP isn't a hardcore and competitive environment, it is more relaxed. <br />
Solo queue isn't a great fit for WoW because the game is very composition dependent. <br />
When you make a Heroes or Overwatch team, players can switch what they are playing to build the right composition. <br />
Having good matchmaking with reasonable queue times, a good skill level match, and building reasonable compositions doesn't seem possible to achieve. It would either be very long queue times or wild mismatches in skill / compositions. <br />
The team is focused on improving the social tools in the game to make it easier for players to join groups of like minded folks. This also is a more social experience, which is something the team tries to emphasize whenever possible as an MMO.<br />
<br />
<br />
Raid Difficulties<br />
<br />
The difficulty structure that the team has settled on is the right one for World of Warcraft. <br />
For someone that does Mythic, both Normal and Raid Finder seem like they are the same, but they are serving very different audiences. <br />
Normal is for a mix of friends and family groups, and pick-up-groups. There are plenty of groups that spend an entire tier progressing through Normal difficulty. This is a satisfying and rewarding experience for those groups.<br />
Raid Finder doesn't provide a satisfying social or progressive experience. <br />
In Mists, Normal was similar to Heroic difficulty today. Groups would find Raid Finder to be unsatisfying and asocial, but Normal was too difficult.<br />
Raid Finder is for people that don't want to commit to a schedule or raid group. If you have some free time, you can jump in, check out the story, get some gear for your alt, finish a quest, and enjoy a bite sized chunk. It's not meant to be a lasting social experience, just a chance to experience raid content and an alternative progression path. <br />
It isn't possible to merge both of those experiences without heavily disappointing one group.<br />
Heroic is for more organized groups that value performance and class composition. <br />
Mythic is for players that want to do that at the very highest level.<br />
Hopefully groups feel like they can focus on two difficulties. Mythic raiders aren't going back to Normal. <br />
30 item levels per tier is the right number assuming players are doing two tiers. The gap allows for progression and getting meaningfully more powerful. Heroic of next tier has to beat Mythic of the previous tier. <br />
<br />
<br />
Professions<br />
<br />
With every expansion, the team has changed their approach to professions. <br />
Delivery mechanisms for recipes and ways for crafters to differentiate themselves from each other change.<br />
What makes one Blacksmith different from another? One can make something that the other can't.<br />
A lot of the differentiation was accomplished through rarity. A lucky drop gave players a reward. <br />
A world where everyone can make steady progress towards making everything harms the ability for a crafter to have an economic advantage. All crafters are basically the same thing. <br />
If you never get the thing you want, that would be frustrating, maybe some bad luck protection would help.<br />
You may not get Rank 3 of what you really want, but you might get Rank 3 for another recipe that will give you a different economic advantage. <br />
If you spend time being better at a progression, that should come with some economic and power advantages. The team isn't quite there yet.<br />

HGC and Heroes of the Dorm 2019 Cancelled, Some Developers Switching Teams<br />
We‚Äôre constantly changing and evolving not only our games, but how we support and grow them. This evolution is vital to our ability to continue doing what we love to do‚Äîmaking great games‚Äîand it‚Äôs what makes Blizzard, Blizzard.<br />
<br />
Over the past several years, the work of evaluating our development processes and making hard decisions has led to new games and other products that we‚Äôre proud of. We now have more live games and unannounced projects than at any point in the company‚Äôs history. We‚Äôre also at a point where we need to take some of our talented developers and bring their skills to other projects. As a result, we‚Äôve made the difficult decision to shift some developers from Heroes of the Storm to other teams, and we‚Äôre excited to see the passion, knowledge, and experience that they‚Äôll bring to those projects. This isn‚Äôt the first time we‚Äôve had to make tough choices like this. Games like Diablo II, World of Warcraft, StarCraft II, Overwatch, and more would not exist had we not made similar decisions in the past.<br />
<br />
Despite the change, Heroes of the Storm remains our love letter to Blizzard‚Äôs worlds and characters. We‚Äôll continue actively supporting the game with new heroes, themed events, and other content that our community loves, though the cadence will change. Ultimately, we‚Äôre setting up the game for long-term sustainability. We‚Äôre so grateful for the support the community has shown from the beginning, and the development team will continue to support Heroes with the same passion, dedication, and creativity that has made the game such a unique experience.<br />
<br />
We‚Äôve also evaluated our plans around Heroes esports‚Äîafter looking at all of our priorities and options in light of the change with the game, the Heroes Global Championship and Heroes of the Dorm will not return in 2019. This was another very difficult decision for us to make. The love that the community has for these programs is deeply felt by everyone who works on them, but we ultimately feel this is the right decision versus moving forward in a way that would not meet the standards that players and fans have come to expect.<br />
<br />
While we don‚Äôt make these decisions lightly, we do look to the future excited about what the decisions will mean for our other live games and all the projects we have in the works. We appreciate all of our hard-working developers and everyone in the Blizzard community, and look forward to sharing many more epic gaming experiences with you in the future.<br />

<br />
The only profession I could make any meaningful income with this expansion is Alchemy. So now all my characters have dropped one profession to pick up herbalism so I get free herbs just doing my daily stuff on all of them.<br />
<br />
I tried making gold on bags, but I can make nearly the same by just selling my cloth drops.<br />
<br />
Some have enchanting as a second profession, enchants are cheap as hell because there is so much loot in the game to disenchant. Scrapping has become useless, because professions have become useless.<br />
<br />
Basically they killed professions this expansion. And with no good gold making opportunities I just focussed on being self sufficient in raids.<br />

Split raids made it difficult to balance raids for everyone, as the top end guilds were overgeared compared to average guilds.<br />
If you want to be competitive and try for the Top 100, you can just focus on gearing up your main roster and maybe some backups rather than running split raids.<br />
The team is able to itemize differently with Personal Loot. With Master Loot, the team had to design loot tables that didn't have niche items that would only be useful to a spec or two. Now the team can better cater to a wider range of itemization, with more fist weapons, range weapons, shields, and more.<br />
For tight knit social groups that weren't abusing any of this, there is something that was lost with these changes.<br />
The change for the game as a whole is a step in the right direction. Once you are past the first few weeks of a new raid tier, tradability helps offset these changes.<br />
The team is trying to make item level a better guide for what is an upgrade.<br />
Personal Loot is here to stay, so let's talk about how we can improve it rather than rolling it back to Master Loot.<br />
<br />
ŒúŒ±œÇ Œ¥ŒøœÖŒªŒµœÖŒµŒπœÇ?????? <br />
<br />
In which world you live????? How can possible be happy a raider with the freakin PL??? I have run ULDIR Hc and each time I do roll (because never drops an item from the bosses) is getting Azurite power, (the brilliant idea you had for the neck) I got better luck on trash to get an item than boss.. and that is not only for me, in the past with ML and please don't give that lame excuse &quot; leader ninja&quot; or unfair distribute.. I was getting items faster either from DKP points or extra roll.<br />
<br />
Its so dictator style that you said: Personal Loot is here to stay, so let's talk about how we can improve it rather than rolling it back to Master Loot.. meaning.. who gives a shit what you ppl said. I decide to do this way. take it or leave.. :o<br />

Well, I don't expect much from the profession team. This is the one who said &quot;but don't people who got the rank 3 from a rated battleground feel special?&quot;<br />

Card pack sales have plummeted. Overwatch gets no viewers on Twitch and it's playerbase consists of twitch girls pretending to play it. Large streamers have quit the game and are doing other things.<br />
<br />
Every single Blizzard franchise is fucking dead. It's actually not surprising they're trying to abandon this market and move to a brand new, dumber mobile one that doesn't expect the same quality standards or game design.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lachlol</div><div class="date">2018-12-14, 12:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Quite bothering to see that. It has to be painful answering to all those questions, knowing, that it's been few months after they have been asked... not entirely successful months.<br />
Thankfully to Ion there were no questions about Azerite system nor Warfronts. My hands are always sweating with embarrassment whenever they are struggling to defend it :(<br />
<br />
There are 2 main problems I see with this Q&amp;A: <br />
<br />
1) There is nothing stable in WoW anymore. Everything is changed and reshaped every expanion. There is hardly any system that survives an expansion in the state it has been created (maybe WQ which is a failure in my opinion/ and mission tables?). I have always been wondering - if I were a developer, and my game failed, I'd have picked whatever players loved and whatever worked and put it altogether. It's THAT simple. The funniest thing is that BfA doesn't look like they cut the costs - it feels like a lot of resources have been used to produce this expansion, but the allocation of those resources has been missed extremely. <br />
Classes - change after change. Garrisons &gt; Order Halls &gt; ??? Challenge Modes &gt; Mage Tower &gt; Mage Tower 2.0?<br />
And now example from the Q&amp;A - With every expansion, the team has changed their approach to professions. Just make one. ONE. working system and all will be fine. There is no need to try so many things. Professions doesn't mean anything, because none apart from top raiders and wealthy people is going to sink they gold for items that won't matter in few days, because there is a better item dropping from mythic 5+ I can farm...<br />
<br />
2) Every change is being made at the cost of something else. The most visible effect of that politics is the decline in guild's usefulness. For the sake of wider society with tools like &quot;Communities&quot;, Group Finders etc. the family&amp;friends communities almost died in this game. Even if I didn't like the expanions like WoD in example, I have always return to play with friends and my guild. Now, it's hard to find some good social guild, as I am not a type of a raider. There are hardly any activites that require a group, and if there are so, there is a Group Finder that will do the job for me :) <br />
<br />
LFR is another example. I can't really understand why people defend it. I have no time to raid. But whenever I had raiding guild, taking a spot as DPS and discovering the instance was something special. Now, for the sake of &quot;everything for everyone&quot; philosophy, they keep tools like LFR, which obviously is just an AFK-fest, being boosted by 3- top DPSers in 25-players group. Everyone ignores the mechanics, and whenever there is a harder boss, Durumu the Forgotten from Throne of Thunder comes to my mind, people still ignore the mechanics until they got like 15 stacks of Determination :D And then you realize that 90% of your team changed. Ah yes, and items trading.<br />
<br />
<br />
I have that starge feeling that todays World of Warcraft is all about &quot;everyone should have their fair share&quot;. There is nothing about &quot;achieving&quot; anymore, which feels like a crucial aspect for the games health. I am not sure if making this game harder and restoring it's old philosophy would make World of Warcraft great again. But I know that todays WoW doesn't work and it's worth giving a try.</div></div><hr />

Simple as that really. So no let's not remove the content the majority participate in just so you can have &quot;MUH RAIDING PRESTIGES&quot; despite the fact Mythic raiding already offers prestige.<br />

Why are you assuming he doesn't realize it and it's by accident? I think we can both agree he's not stupid, and he's shown he's aware of the complaints he generates.<br />

By giving different things to do for the diiferent groups of players.Blizzard are focusing mostly on raids and M+.Yea but that is not all.The problem with WoW is that the only places worth doing are those rewarding ilvl.What about collections,story and more Open world stuff to do?Or more solo content?<br />

<br />
There is no reason at all why should not copy GW2's approach to instanced PvP.<br />
<br />
1. All instanced PvP is level 120 (you can create a level 1 character and PvP at the top level right NOW without having to play any PvE).<br />
<br />
2. Create a &quot;PvP&quot; lobby that let's players hang out in, practice skills, get used to a new (level 120) character. You can also choose your talents, trinkets, stat distribution, and gear.<br />
<br />
3. Speaking of gear... It shouldn't matter. All gear is normalized for competitive play. Like mentioned above, you just choose an &quot;amulet&quot; (it can be whatever) that determines how your secondary stats are distributed. All available trinkets are accessible in a dropdown.<br />
<br />
4. Create a robust rewards system with tons of awesome and exclusive items for PvPers.<br />
<br />
<br />
It's almost 2019! If all I want to do is PvP, there is no reason why I shouldn't be able to PvP competitively on a new character immediately (say, if my main gets nerfed to the ground), without having to slog through 120 levels and then grinding out monotonous world quests (many of each don't even involve combat).</div></div><hr />

Instead, it'd be better to have a currency drop that you could buy your own loot instead IMO. Just remove that drama of loot entirely. The &quot;hero's&quot; job is to kill while leaving the stuff behind for someone else to scavenge that you can lay claim to later.</div></div><hr />

<br />
normally i agree to a good degree what ion says. some of their mindsets are well thought and developed over time (i know that a lot of ppl would disagree, but maybe this ppl dont play wow since 2005 without interruption).<br />
<br />
but in this case, i will not get it. the stance on professions is utterly wrong in that case imo.<br />
<br />
no crafter is interested in ‚Äûthis guy one can do x and that guy can do y‚Äú. professions are simply not based of this. and there are way too many crafters to get some uniqueness. instead you have 3000 crafters that can do x and 3000 that can do y. there is nothing special in this.<br />
<br />
but on the other end, the result of that shit he said just is that every crafter is frustrated. collecting recipes are for completionists. professions always were in that category. hard RNG to get all reciepes is ONLY frustrating for every crafter, but has no gain for everyone else. <br />
<br />
besides that, crafting was never intended to be a form of uniqueness. <br />
<br />
what is this for a fucked up shit stance ? how out of touch can devs be ?<br />
<br />
wtf... ???</div></div><hr />

In terms of spread of content I think BfA is in a pretty good place. There's everything from WQs to those playing for 15 minutes per night, right up to Mythic/+ content for those taking it more seriously, with something for everyone in-between. There's no shortage of stuff to do in game, no matter your skill or time constraints. This is good. Narrowing the game down so that it only appeals to the 5%, or less, is not the way forward. Jeff Vogel, who knows a thing or two about game design, wrote a blog about it. (http://jeff-vogel.blogspot.com/2009/11/make-your-game-easy-then-make-it-easier.html)</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Smeller</div><div class="date">2018-12-14, 03:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Why PL is bad:<br />
So you run in a raid where you're one of the only ppl to wear cloth. You are nearly on your own and have to rely on the mercy of loot luck. Then a trial comes along and he has tremendous loot luck. Getting items left and right. Normally you would get at least a few pieces of the loot but not with PL. So your raid basically gifts a player that may or may not join the raid all the gear while your main raiders are fucked. That just shifts the problem into another direction.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Reachie</div><div class="date">2018-12-14, 03:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So what the fuck is the point of this entire segment?<br />
<br />
<br />
Personal Loot<br />
Overall, the team is happy with how Personal Loot is working out so far.<br />
The best geared raid groups are still the ones doing the hardest content.<br />
The benefits to removing personal loot are three things:<br />
On the lower end, there are lots of guilds that churn through a steady stream of trials. Historically, guilds wouldn't give trials any loot, causing them to not have any progression.<br />
On the highest end, there are guilds running multiple groups in parallel that would funnel loot to specific characters using Master Loot. This made it 4-5x faster to gear up compared to regular groups that were just doing one run. This led to more and more guilds to start running split raids.<br />
Split raids made it difficult to balance raids for everyone, as the top end guilds were overgeared compared to average guilds.<br />
If you want to be competitive and try for the Top 100, you can just focus on gearing up your main roster and maybe some backups rather than running split raids.<br />
The team is able to itemize differently with Personal Loot. With Master Loot, the team had to design loot tables that didn't have niche items that would only be useful to a spec or two. Now the team can better cater to a wider range of itemization, with more fist weapons, range weapons, shields, and more.<br />
For tight knit social groups that weren't abusing any of this, there is something that was lost with these changes.<br />
The change for the game as a whole is a step in the right direction. Once you are past the first few weeks of a new raid tier, tradability helps offset these changes.<br />
The team is trying to make item level a better guide for what is an upgrade.<br />
Personal Loot is here to stay, so let's talk about how we can improve it rather than rolling it back to Master Loot.<br />
<br />
Lets talk about why personal loot sucks and why removing it is good, and then end by saying &quot;personal loot is here to stay; and we aren't rolling back to master loot&quot;<br />
<br />
What a fucking joke.</div></div><hr />

Why even spend all of this time to design these raids when they will be dead content the next tier? Clearly there is a way to make this work, because it worked in Vanilla/BC/WOTLK, even without the LFR/normal/heroic/mythic paradigm. It just doesn't make sense to me that they would rather have people grinding mythic+ to get better gear than doing raids from a previous tier.</div></div><hr />

uuuh Overwatch is practically dead, chief. I'm a fan, but we have to be honest with ourselves. Fortnite may be losing momentum, but Fortnite has more players that will play it THIS MINUTE than Overwatch will have in the next 5 years combined.<br />

There's a flip side to this though. I'm a main tank in a mythic progression guild so i totally understand your point and don't necessarily disagree at all.<br />

ArP, Spirit, Mp5, and a plethora of other, far more interesting then versatility, stats. Haste caps, snapshotting, all of that that we've lost over the years that made gearing interesting.

<br />
It was still more fun, something like ArP, you didn't want just a little, so you'd hold off on it until you'd amass a bunch of gear with it on it and then just switch it all over and wreck things.<br />
<br />
I'm super salty about them removing tank gear though, I tanked all through the game until they removed it all (defense was mostly ok, it was kind of like hit/exp, just a capping thing) and then tanking started to feel dull because it was just a meatshield dps that did shit for dps. They tried other things to make it interesting, but ended up scrapping every single one of the aside from AM, which isn't really that interesting.<br />
<br />
Honestly... if they gave us back actual tanking gear, and did away with some of the RNG things like rng gemslots (which would be a boon for JC) I'd be at least satisfied</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is no reason at all why should not copy GW2's approach to instanced PvP.<br />
<br />
1. All instanced PvP is level 120 (you can create a level 1 character and PvP at the top level right NOW without having to play any PvE).<br />
<br />
2. Create a &quot;PvP&quot; lobby that let's players hang out in, practice skills, get used to a new (level 120) character. You can also choose your talents, trinkets, stat distribution, and gear.<br />
<br />
3. Speaking of gear... It shouldn't matter. All gear is normalized for competitive play. Like mentioned above, you just choose an &quot;amulet&quot; (it can be whatever) that determines how your secondary stats are distributed. All available trinkets are accessible in a dropdown.<br />
<br />
4. Create a robust rewards system with tons of awesome and exclusive items for PvPers.<br />
<br />
<br />
It's almost 2019! If all I want to do is PvP, there is no reason why I shouldn't be able to PvP competitively on a new character immediately (say, if my main gets nerfed to the ground), without having to slog through 120 levels and then grinding out monotonous world quests (many of each don't even involve combat).<br />
<br />
Holy shit dude, I drool thinking about it, Blizzard already has a pvp realm, I always thought it should be available to the public, oh you want to pvp? jump here and play ranks all day with all the gear available, done.</div></div><hr />

There's everything from WQs to those playing for 15 minutes per night, right up to Mythic/+ content for those taking it more seriously, with something for everyone in-between. There's no shortage of stuff to do in game, no matter your skill or time constraints. This is good. Narrowing the game down so that it only appeals to the 5%, or less, is not the way forward. Jeff Vogel, who knows a thing or two about game design, wrote a blog about it. (http://jeff-vogel.blogspot.com/2009/11/make-your-game-easy-then-make-it-easier.html)<br />
<br />
I'm not really thinking about narrowing it to the 5% or less. I would like to do thing that require some thinking and using social skills. Whatever you are going to do that requires group, Group Finder will do it for you. Like, the best example is DF added back in WotLK. I'm not saying it's bad they added that tool, but you can't deny it's taking something away from the game. <br />
<br />
We came to the place in WoW, where so many things have been traded for something else. For me it's excitment of raiding. Many people would say I'm wrong about it, but I really think LFR took the magic away. Everyone knows it's just a AFK-fest, even Ion admitted it yestarday saying that this is a difficulty that is not about progression or social aspect of the game. So if it's not about two cores values that made WoW so epic game, what's LFR about? I don't know a person, who has no time to raid normals, like even once a week?<br />
<br />
You say there are variety of things to do. Let's pick up one of the main features - Warfronts. Did it like, 4-5 times? The biggest issue is that it's prearranged to be won. There is no way to lose is - only if you have a team full of AFKers? When I did it for the first time I couldn't believe how stupid this system is, seriously. Never seen such boring thing in WoW tbh.<br />
<br />
Even the story feels like it's been written in 5 minutes before implementations. It. Is. Horrible. No matter what Sylvanas do now, it's bad.<br />
If she's just crazy - that would be the worst scenario.<br />
If she is possesed by any entitiy, especially an Old God - meh. Everyone would have known it.<br />
If she would have her redemption story - that would be a great disappointment. <br />
<br />
Writting stories is not the best thing Blizz has done in the last couple of years. I'm not sure, if instead of all those &quot;mindblowing&quot; twists and plots, I'd like more a villian created throught the expansion, and killed at the very end, just like a Lich King or Deathwing. At least back then I knew who I'm fighting. Now it maight be the Archimonde with a retconned story. Not to mention all the Argus, spaceship and Titan bullshit :( It all felt like it was written by a teenager. And that bad Illidans story-arc. Just. Wow.<br />
<br />
I mean, there were many before me discussing the expansion. But don't you really feel, it's not about quantity, but quality. And the latter is missing... like a lot? It all feels flat, unrewarding and not really well-thought. You know, I never cared about people leaving the game, but you can't say people leave because it's a conspiracy or something. People wouldn't give up playing this game just to fit some drama theory made on forums. People quit massively - and yeah, I have no data to prove. But I had a nearly full list of active players; now it's like 1/3 of all those players? <br />
<br />
I'm just saying it, because I still play, and I'm freaking worringabout this game's future :/</div></div><hr />

Alright, you covered a lot of ground there, so I'll respond to some of those points. A lot of it is subjective, of course. I personally have no interest in raiding, or any group content beyond a warfront or heroic dungeon. I'll run a LFR wing on my main when it opens to see the design of the place, then I'm done - I can generally get better gear through other (essentially solo) means. It's great that you like to raid, but it's not for me. If there's transmogs in a raid or dungeon I want I'll wait an expansion or two then revisit; that's fine, I'm not in a rush.<br />
<br />
I agree with you that BfA is poorly written. Frankly, it's dull. Maybe Legion was a hard act to follow, who knows. But, I enjoy being out in the world, I enjoy the environments, and I enjoy levelling alts. So, it keeps me subbed. And I still see plenty of people out in the world. But I guess people just get bored too, and move on. That's fine; it's always been that way. Is it any worse now than it has been previously?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think it is worse. I started playing back in the BC as a total noob. But i remember how exciting it was to discover the history of Northrend races and especially the Lich King. From that point it seems clear to me they didn't plan the story well, and what we see today is the result.<br />
<br />
I think they try to make the story more &quot;flowing&quot;. Well, they actually said that I think. There would be nothing wrong about; I'd even said it'd be amazing (and Garrosh had a huge potential to be a great character. Yet, the constant retcons to the story kills it. Same thing happens when they interweave too many characters with the same role with each other and the mess comes out of this: to be more precise - in 8.0/ 8.1 we have a questline with Talanji, Rokhan and Spirit of Vol'jin. We travel from one Master of Death to another - Helya, Eyir, Lich King, Bwonsamdi, Old Gods - there are really too many of them, and it makes the story really flat and senseless.<br />
<br />
That's about story. But I must admit - the overall climate and music in BfA is absolutely outstanding. Zones are really beautiful and this is what saddens me even more - so much effort has been put by artists to make it great, but it somehow doesn't work for me.<br />

Weakness in one area should be made up with strengths in another. If you are less mobile, you should be harder to kill. If you have high mobility, you should probably go down more easily if people are able to focus on you.<br />
The team would rather focus on increasing strengths rather than mitigating weaknesses. Always bolstering weaknesses makes everyone more average at everything.You don't say :rolleyes: however, you forget that ‚Äúold‚Äù balance was in weaknesses vs strengths (you didn't have opportunity to have only second = disbalance, so having both is equally matter) what makes second paragraph wrong and excess.<br />
The team views a Mythic+ dungeon like a single boss encounter, which is why you can't change talents or respec in the middle of the dungeon. Choices are more interesting when you are weighing the entire range of situations that the dungeon is going to offer.As already mentioned, what team wants or doesn't want is their problem (https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/is-wow-just-an-esport-now/159508/96), so if they don‚Äôt want players to change items sets on fly, they need to be more original, not stiffer, because dungeons must work under same conditions as open world - for example, if this is &quot;single boss encounter&quot;, then characters always need to be in battle (since this is only mechanism in the game that prohibits such behavior), BUT then it won't be &quot;those dungeons&quot; they should be, rather there will be survival challenge (so game world logic leaves them here, and &quot;competitive (https://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/2455778-New-Warmode-buff?p=50614891#post50614891)&quot; logic takes the wheel (http://imgur.com/xsjqi.jpg)).<br />
Your gameplay should be more important than having the right gear swapping macros set up.

Paladins and Druids traditionally had raid buffs, but in the Battle for Azeroth environment, they already had plenty of utility.<br />
The team would rather focus on the unique and strong utility that Druids and Paladins already bring rather than adding more buffs if they feel that there isn't incentive to bring these classes.It's not important (and this applies especially strong for BfA), only (https://eu.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/why-nobody-cared-about-balance-in-2004/13407/6) class (https://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/2377137-Comparing-Specs-from-Vanilla-to-Legion?p=49009962&amp;viewfull=1#post49009962) fantasy (https://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/2426349-I-will-admit-that-I-now-believe-beta-testers-had-it-right-(class-mechanics)?p=50051302&amp;viewfull=1#post50051302) alone is important (but not spec).<br />

Most players aren't feeling forced to go back and clear lower difficulties anymore. In Legion, set pieces were a reason to go back to try and get upgrades, but the game has moved away from tier sets. Yeah, well, in a sense, especially considering that players aren't, in principle, motivated to go &quot;higher&quot;, which means it conflicts with previous statement, and therefore these all are just confusing words.<br />
It's up to players to choose where to spend their time, and what is most rewarding. You are better off doing Mythic+ than going back to lower raid difficulties for a slim chance at an upgrade. Or may be any raids at all? LFR for story and it's enough?

Do you at least yourself believe that? ...especially regarding PvP &quot;progression (https://us.v-cdn.net/5021879/uploads/editor/8f/hq22xyi1vz8t.gif)&quot; (won't be superfluous to understand what you put into this concept (+ (https://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/2380324-PvP-Normalization-is-an-RPG-and-Game-Design-Failure?p=48967858#post48967858)(+ (https://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/2438009-Gear-doesn-t-matter-anymore-at-all?p=50263875&amp;viewfull=1#post50263875)/+ (https://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/2438009-Gear-doesn-t-matter-anymore-at-all?p=50274905&amp;viewfull=1#post50274905)))) :cool:<br />
The team is focused on improving the social tools in the game to make it easier for players to join groups of like minded folks. This also is a more social experience, which is something the team tries to emphasize whenever possible as an MMO. Repair your game - fantasy and gameplay, and leave communication to people. You have already done enough damage here (https://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/2439041-Raider-io-and-Curve-are-ruining-the-game-wake-up-people?p=50275674&amp;viewfull=1#post50275674) for &quot;doing stuff instead of players&quot;. This is game, and experiments you better leave to psychologists and a sociologists.

The difficulty structure that the team has settled on is the right one for World of Warcraft. No it's not (https://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/2452106-All-these-difficulties-Right-or-wrong?p=50538110&amp;viewfull=1#post50538110) :rolleyes: next!<br />
If you never get the thing you want, that would be frustrating, maybe some bad luck protection would help. Or maybe it's better to treat it, instead of just giving a crutch, with parting words &quot;Everything alright, you'll going to limp forward somehow, we believe in you!&quot;?<br />
<br />
ps. However, what is there to be surprised, everything is as usual (https://imgur.com/gallery/7A5sCM9).</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ElDoorO</div><div class="date">2018-12-19, 02:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yup,instead we're just much harsher with trials and it's way harder for them to get a guild,since we don't want to give loot to people who won't stay<br />
<br />
A trial is an investment.They show what they can do,and in return we help them up.If they're good enough,they stay and can get their loot<br />
<br />
Now even a trash tier trial can come in,get loot without putting any effort in,leave,effectively wasting the time of the guild and robbing them of their loot.<br />
<br />
It has no benefits whatsoever,the only people who were using ML were people ML was made for,and PL was already forced in pug groups since early Legion so that's not an argument either<br />
It does nothing to help pugs,and it hurts guilds<br />
<br />
It lets people know to avoid your guild like the plague.<br />
Further, if you aren't willing to trade items you don't need to someone who needs it -- that speaks more on your lack of character than the trials and speaks as to why going to PL was needed.<br />
<br />
It helps guilds because it doesn't allow toxic RL's to funnel gear in a selfish way. Plus, on the whole, guilds that run the harder content outgear those that don't. So you can't deny, on any level, that it's &quot;hurting&quot; guilds since pretty much no &quot;normal&quot; guild outgears a &quot;mythic&quot; guild.</div></div><hr />

<br />
litterally every guild in the top 1500 *has* to act that way<br />
<br />
litterally every guild that wants to clear content *has* to act that way<br />
<br />
litterally every guild that doesn't want hoppers to use them and leave right away *has* to act that way<br />
<br />
<br />
Besides,the &quot;toxic RL abusing ML&quot; is a myth,it happens in about one guild out of 75 at most,because people in guilds using ML actually care about progressing,it's an empty excuse used by people who never worked for their loot and can't stand that it goes to someone that genuinely helps the guild</div></div><hr />
