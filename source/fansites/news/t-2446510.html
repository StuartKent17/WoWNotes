Restoring History: Creating WoW Classic Panel<br />
<br />
What's Under the Hood?<br />
<br />
Database Data<br />
Art Assets<br />
Source Code<br />
<br />
They kept track of everything in a repository that kept track of all changes made to the game.<br />
This repository has been keeping track of changes since 1997.<br />
First bug fix tracked - April 25, 1997.<br />
Two versions of the game in database - live and development.<br />
The development data was created over the live version. Eventually they changed it so that the team could work on multiple patches at a time.<br />
Art Assets include 3D models and textures which combine to in-game models.<br />
In digging back into the database, they discovered that they only had art assets from recent expansions.<br />
They found a backup with another backup folder that housed some old art assets.<br />
The old WoW -<br />
<br />
Didn't run in the Blizzard Cloud<br />
Had no battle.net desktop app<br />
Had no login servers<br />
Had no customer support access<br />
Every bug, exploit and hack re-activated.<br />
<br />
The team decided to layer the old version on the modern tech to solve this issue.<br />
However, the new source code didn't know how to load the old data.<br />
They eventually created a prototype that used the 7.3.5 client with the old data implemented. Combat wasn't quite there but you could still learn abilities from trainers and other long lost parts of vanilla.<br />
When you ventured outside of areas unaffected by the Cataclysm and into zones that were affected you saw weird things like missing water, aquatic creatures on land and terrestrial creatures underwater. There was also armor that was untextured and so on.<br />
Feeding the modern engine the 1.12 engine doesn't read perfectly. Certain object placements are off which leads to trees flying in the air and stuff like the shattered Loch Modan damn still holding back water.<br />
The team had technology that could take the 1.12 engine and allow the modern engine to read it and place things correctly.<br />
Classic has the full devotion of the Warcraft team.<br />
The team was able to use reference data to find models in Classic that were not correct, such as colors of lanterns.<br />
Purple was used as a color to recognize wrong model colors.<br />
The team set out to recreate the game as authentic to the original as possible.<br />
Things like pet happiness and training was not able to be restored with this method. They had the data to restore them, however, and managed to re-code them back into the game.<br />
Rogue combo points being on the target, weapon skills, and critical blows all had to be re-coded back to how they were in vanilla.<br />
They were able to find and fix model errors that caused corpses to stand.<br />
The team even went back and restored the old character customization screen, including art.<br />
They are not promising pixel perfect perfection, but they use their references side by side to get as close to the original as possible.<br />
They were also able to fix lighting errors.<br />
They are not done with the game yet. Certain things still need work including:<br />
<br />
Capital cities<br />
Dungeons and raids<br />
PvP<br />
<br />
Their design philosophy with Classic is to be as authentic as possible to 2006.<br />
High priority is put on the integrity of social dynamics.<br />
They want to avoid messing with the 1.12 data.<br />
There will be no dungeon finder in Classic. This is to preserve the integrity of the social dynamics.<br />
Typing /LFR on the demo opens the window but it is unusable and won't be in the final product.<br />
Cross-realm grouping is not in Classic.<br />
Flying is definitely not in Classic.<br />
Achievements are not in Classic.<br />
No unified auction house in Classic between Horde and Alliance.<br />
The debuff limit was a technical limitation of the time but has NOT been lifted in Classic because it affects the 1.12 code and would cause changes.<br />
Mail functions just like it did in Vanilla. No more instant mail.<br />
You can take mail out of your mailbox faster as it doesn't affect anything.<br />
The 2 hour period for loot trading between group members is staying in Classic.<br />
Rogue energy regeneration is returning back to how it was in Classic.<br />
AddOns that pilot your character's rotation are being restricted. They want to find a middle ground between the old and the new for AddOns.<br />
The content release plan is to have staged content unlocks.<br />
Molten Core and Onyxia will be there at launch along with Dire Maul, and the World bosses Kazzak and Azuregos.<br />
The formal PvP rewards system will not be there at launch because they overshadow early raid gear.<br />
Stage 2 - Blackwing Lair, Battlegrounds, and Zul'Gurub.<br />
Stage 3 - Ahn'Qiraj, Tier 0.5, Silithus and the green dragons.<br />
Stage 4 - Naxxramas raid, Scourge Invasions.<br />
Silithus will include the opening of Ahn'Qiraj.<br />
These stages will launch when it is determined that it is time for them to happen.<br />
<br />

<br />
I wouldn’t worry too much. I’m here at blizzcon and have played the demo as a caster. Sitting down to drink is still very much like it used to be. I think he wasn’t speaking more too the effect of the prototype being more extreme and not quite right</div></div><hr />

It's hilarious. Then they'll complain when things crash because they complained about sharding.</div></div><hr />

There is a big untapped market at the moment tho, lots of people has been asking for classic wow ever since TBC, many of whom would not play BFA no matter how much content they release for it.</div></div><hr />

Different project, different developers. It in no way affects what the team are doing and what they have planned for BfA. Two totally separate teams.</div></div><hr />

Could get an old CRT monitor.. I remember having to use like a 11 inch CRT monitor when i raided MC and BWL.. I had to use it cause my bigger one broke, and we had this old crappy one in the basement. I used it for months and kinda got used to it.. Those were the days lol</div></div><hr />

The phase thing is to be expected, simulating patch releases in a way that makes sense.</div></div><hr />

They're doing the opposite of what Nostalrius did.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They were using an old client which required compatibility options and/or older OSes like Windows XP, and emulated servers such as Mangos or Wowemu, which were far from what we consider Blizzard quality.<br />
<br />
Blizzard's goal is to have the original Classic experience running in modern computers and OSes, with the quality we expect from Blizzard games.</div></div><hr />

<br />
if you would have just used your damn eyes you would have seen that only blizzard can do what was shown there.<br />
<br />
you are right that they are emulating it. they have to, else all the crackheads will wallwalk again everywhere (which they already complain about, idiots) or the client isn't secure. you cannot bring the vanilla wow back, it isn't possible in any meaningful way!<br />
<br />
and no private server can achieve the level of the original creators. also, private servers are illegal and i hope that blizzard cracks them down as soon as classic is up and running for good.</div></div><hr />

16. It's 1.12.1<br />

Because their work was sloppy as shit. All they did was take some MaNGoS core projects and apply their own things to it, if anything they should ask some of the bigger dudes doing all the core work.</div></div><hr />

Why would this make it so they can gear easier than in vanilla? You would have a point if it used personal loot; classic was always you could literally need roll anything, and greed roll anything. All it does is make it so accidentally hitting &quot;need&quot; doesn't mean customer support has to be called up to do the same thing where trading an item directly does now.</div></div><hr />

Not really emulation.<br />
<br />
Basically, they determined that it would be more efficient to preserve their modern infrastructure and manually reverse changes than it would be to take the original version and retrofit the old infrastructure with modern features.<br />
<br />
They have a completely accurate version of 1.12 that they're running internally in order to make the necessary comparisons so they can reverse conflicting changes.</div></div><hr />

They are going from these amazingly gorgeous models and downgrading to....shit...seems like the nice way to put it. It should feel wrong. I can understand returning the gameplay aspect of Classic, but why in the hell would anyone want to go back to the old models? Just why?<br />

As someone who played Fem Tauren for years before the remodel, I will NEVER go back to the old ones. That alone is enough to keep me from committing to Classic long term.</div></div><hr />

I actually prefer the old models..at least expression wise...than the new models. i'm not a complete purist, I think having the option to have either would be a good thing that doesn't affect anyone else's game play.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">De Lupe</div><div class="date">2018-11-04, 09:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I actually prefer the old models..at least expression wise...than the new models. i'm not a complete purist, I think having the option to have either would be a good thing that doesn't affect anyone else's game play.<br />
<br />
I'm all for trying to re-capture the old gameplay. Strip away the group tools, the flying mounts, personal loot, the class changes, etc... Take away the &quot;bad&quot; things that &quot;ruin&quot; the game. But not everything that's been added to the game since then has been &quot;bad&quot; as many would claim. Some of them do absolutely nothing to hurt the game in any capacity...model updates, mount tab, toy box, Transmog, just to name a few. There isn't one single downside to any of those things, so why strip them away? Because some guy in a basement will throw a hissy if it isn't &quot;pure&quot; Classic? That is not an acceptable reason.<br />
<br />
Why not combine the best of the old with the best of the new and make a game that everyone will love instead of a game fifteen years in the past that only some will love?<br />
Have the old models be the default, but then have an option in the system tab for the updated ones. Boom! Both groups are happy.<br />
Don't want Tmog? Okay, go to the options tab and disable Tmogs. You see everyone's gear as is while everyone else can enjoy what few...very few options are available. BOOM! Both groups happy.<br />
<br />
I just don't understand this adamant refusal for both sides to find a common middle ground that makes everyone happy.</div></div><hr />

And this is why i wont touch it :D classic was about old PC not 4k resolution. Remember if something is new doesnt mean is better. I just can imagine the /2 Trade about req in MC/BWL raids.. and these whispers about &quot;DUDE MY KILL RAGNARUS 10YRS AGO&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
A shame they aren't going to treat it like seasons in Diablo - have the game &quot;reset&quot; and have the events happen on a set rotation over a year or two years, then some sort of mechanism so you can't use your decked out characters for the new season.</div></div><hr />

It would effect social dynamics. For example, requiring achievements to get invited to groups. Couldn’t happen back then, shouldn’t happen in classic</div></div><hr />

Not trying to hate on people that miss OG Vanilla, I was there too, but the effort they are putting into this could really go into other content or another game just my 2 cents.<br />
<br />
What other game tho? The demand is high for WoW Classic and Blizzard is a huge corporation now, they have tons of employees so it's not like Retail WoW is getting sacrificed for WoW Classic.<br />
<br />
<br />
It's hi-res and runs on widescreen, why would anybody do that? Classic is on the modern engine, you know.<br />
<br />
1.12 already supports 1080p and widescreen resolutions and runs on Vista/7/8/8.1 and 10 without issues so it's nothing new in Classic even tho the Dev says like it was a new thing, it really isn't. WoW 1.12 is more &quot;modern&quot; than people think, it aged well imo.<br />
