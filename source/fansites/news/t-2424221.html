Developer Interview - Battle for Azeroth Story<br />
Heather Newman had the opportunity to talk to Senior Designer Steve Burke and senior narrative designer Steve Danuser (https://www.forbes.com/sites/hnewman/2018/08/24/azshara-cinematic-storytelling-ignite-warcraft-expansion-sales-designer-interview/#385abfb3517a).<br />
<br />
<br />
It was cool to write different stories for each faction, really taking the gloves off and letting the factions go to war.<br />
Kul Tiras and Zandalar had very distinct stories. The War Campaign lets you see both sides of the world, but from different perspectives. <br />
In Stormsong, the Horde come in and assault a city. This was a last minute plan, as before the team had different content implemented there that they played through and didn't feel like it was what they really wanted.<br />
The Horde and Alliance have different internal struggles and conflict is only going to intensify as we go forward. <br />
Upon looking at PvP death maps, the team realized that some of the hotspots were where players came out of a cinematic and were vulnerable to attack. They made some changes to mitigate this. <br />
The team wanted the pre-expansion events to feel real and have real consequences, with a lasting impact on the world. It wasn't just another conflict that flared up for a while and went away. <br />
The team has made more of an effort during the previous few expansions to have all of the storytelling mechanisms tied into gameplay. <br />
Long sequences of talking, exposition, explaining, character interaction are not what WoW is best at. The Three Sisters (https://www.mmo-champion.com/content/7657-Three-Sisters-Battle-for-Azeroth-Comics-Issue-3) comic was a lot of listening to dialogue, which fit a comic better than in game. <br />
A lot of the character animations were made back when the cinematics camera was farther away from characters, but that doesn't hold up as well today with close up shots. The team will continue to improve this going forward. <br />

How World of Warcraft Was Made: The Inside Story of Nearly 20 Years of Development<br />
USGamer has an article (https://www.usgamer.net/articles/how-world-of-warcraft-was-made-the-inside-story) on how World of Warcraft was made, with interviews with many people that worked on WoW throughout the years. <br />

<br />
Outdoor Mob Scaling<br />
Well geared toons from the end of the previous expansion have always had a very easy time in the first few levels of a new expansion. The scaling isn't broken, it's how the scaling should work. The only way for this to not be an issue is to remove scaling altogether. And it's a design choice that the benefits of scaling outweigh downsides like this.<br />
Exactly.<br />
<br />
The way the outdoor world functions in Battle for Azeroth is exactly how Legion worked, in virtually every regard. But looking farther back, an endgame-geared character from the prior expansion having a harder and harder time killing things as they level is how WoW has worked since its very first expansion, The Burning Crusade. As you move into new content, you face progressively stronger foes. If you aren’t replacing your gear as you level because you’re already overgeared for your level, then in relative terms you're going to feel weaker against same-level enemies.<br />
<br />
Specifically, level 110 enemies are tuned to be a fair fight for someone who just quested through Legion and hit 110 wearing items along the way (average item level of, say, 160 or so). That's essential, or fresh 110s moving into Battle for Azeroth content would run into a frustrating brick wall of difficulty. But it means that if you are level 110 wearing Argus gear and legendaries (average item level of, say, 230 or even higher), you’re massively overpowered in relative terms. Easily twice as strong as someone who just quested through Legion and did nothing else. And that’s nothing new - that's power progression, and the reward for the time spent on Argus and elsewhere strengthening your character.<br />
<br />
But moving on, level 117 enemies are tuned to be a fair fight for someone who is wearing quest rewards from level 117 quests. The same player above in Argus gear will only recently have started to find upgrades from quests, and is actually now wearing nearly the exact same gear as the player who leveled straight through without doing Legion endgame content. This is exactly how it worked 4 years ago when someone wearing Siege of Orgrimmar gear was wrecking level 90 enemies in Frostfire or Shadowmoon at 90, and then started to have a tough time against level 97 mobs in Spires of Arak at level 97. Higher-level enemies are tougher.<br />
<br />
Again, nothing new. The only difference is that, since Legion, one Antorus-geared player may have started in Tiragarde Sound and steamrolled it at 110, before running into resistance in Drustvar at 117, while another Antorus-geared player may have started in Drustvar and had an easy time at 110, only to find tougher enemies at 117 in Tiragarde, depending on the order in which they each chose to tackle the zones. It admittedly can feel awkward to return to a specific dungeon or a specific area and find that the enemies there have effectively grown stronger while you were away, but that is what enables flexibility in zone choice when leveling, and makes the entire world relevant at max level, a core part of what made Legion's outdoor world experience successful.<br />
<br />
The pre-Legion design, applied to Battle for Azeroth Horde content, might have gone like this: Zuldazar and Atal’dazar could be 110-114 content, Vol’dun and Temple of Sethraliss 113-117, and Nazmir and Underrot 116-120. That would likely have felt better in terms of rationalizing increasing world difficulty as you level, but it would have come at the expense of a more linear leveling experience, after which those zones would be largely irrelevant at endgame. We feel that the upsides of having the outdoor world continue to be relevant, and be a place where we can tell ongoing War Campaign stories and stage other content, for the months to come, are worth that increased awkwardness while leveling.<br />
<br />
Finally, looking at the max-level experience, players are already objectively much stronger than they were at 110 in Legion. We’re starting to see random pickup groups going back and doing Mythic Antorus with ilvl ~330 level 120 characters, for achievements and transmog, and an ilvl 330 PUG kills Mythic Argus the Unmaker in about 5 minutes. Top raid guilds were doing it in ~9 minutes at 110 just a few weeks ago. There's no special scaling or legacy buff involved: People are simply stronger now than they were a month ago, when fighting the same old foes.<br />
<br />
At max level, everything you do to upgrade your gear and the power of your Heart of Azeroth will make your experience playing the game relatively easier. We’ve seen no data whatsoever to support claims that a fresh 120 has an easier time with any content, outdoors or otherwise, than one who has improved their gear through doing dungeons and world quests and the like. A player in ilvl 330 gear is killing world quest foes more than 40% faster than someone who just hit 120 at ilvl 280, while having a much larger health pool (and, again, enemy damage output isn't scaling up at all). That relative strength will continue to increase over the weeks to come with every additional bit of gear and additional Azerite powers acquired.<br />
<br />
Philosophically, we completely agree that progression is an essential part of an RPG experience. Rewards need to mean something, and their impact needs to be felt when playing the game. To the extent that we compromise that value in some places, it's never done lightly, and is always in service of a what we view as a greater benefit elsewhere (in this case, the ability to choose a non-linear path through zones while leveling, and having the entirety of the new world remaining relevant at 120, instead of just small pieces of it).</div></div><hr />

it seems like the burning of teldrassil should have been more of a climax to the conflict rather than the initial action.<br />

High Noon on Balance was one of the stupidest traits, especially because it was one of their best single target ones. It just involved us spamming sunfire like idiots, but we still have one which involves spamming moonfire. They really aren't inventive, i'd hope that as the expansion progresses they at least get somewhat more interesting. It feels like class design has taken a solid step backward from Legion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
THey don't do equipped item level anymore, because there was an exploit in Legion where just taking a ring off and keeping it in your inventory made you stronger due to the scaling. So they just made it so the items in your bags count for the scaling so you would have to take the extra step of going to your bank.</div></div><hr />

<br />

Remove it because you don't want it? Why? What's so special about your opinion?<br />
<br />
I like outdoor scaling, because I like actually fighting mobs instead of just killing them with a tag and moving on. Keeps the world relevant, esp as we're only in week 2. As time goes on and power increases exponentially, this scaling will drop off. Remember that your top geared toons in Argus were smashing mobs down much faster than your average ones.<br />
<br />
Scaling works on ilvl bagged and not equipped, because people were removing low-impact items like neck/rings/trinkets to abuse the scaling system.<br />
<br />
And no, flying right now is a shit idea. Turns the game into a drop-in, tag mob, complete quest, drop out affair.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I like outdoor scaling, because I like actually fighting mobs instead of just killing them with a tag and moving on. Keeps the world relevant, esp as we're only in week 2. As time goes on and power increases exponentially, this scaling will drop off. Remember that your top geared toons in Argus were smashing mobs down much faster than your average ones.<br />
<br />
Scaling works on ilvl bagged and not equipped, because people were removing low-impact items like neck/rings/trinkets to abuse the scaling system.<br />
<br />
And no, flying right now is a shit idea. Turns the game into a drop-in, tag mob, complete quest, drop out affair.<br />

In Legion, the reduction from stat ratings going up wasn't nearly as noticeable as here, and you could go through the leveling process from 100 to 110 at a fairly stable rate. In BfA, as soon as you reach 116, things start going downhill, and the difficulty practically skyrockets with every level until 120, where it peaks to the point where pulling anything more than one mob is guaranteed to kill you. If they could fix that, and maybe tone down the initial stats on 120 mobs so that freshly maxed people don't have to fight for survival, it'd be perfect.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well i too leveled toon on both sides - the Zandalar storylines are crap. Nazmir is scooby doo episode or azmodan 2.0. Voldun is just boring, there are high stakes but the presentation is dull. The entire premise of this zone dont work, the place to send exiles which is like, 10 f from main city. Yeah... The Vulpera are nothing special, just forgetable. Main zone (forget the name, Zuldazar?) is most interesting but the abysmal zone design is just tiresome after time. But give props because it actually build up the different factions and powers within the empire of trolls. <br />
<br />
On the other hand the Kul Tiran zones are riddled with mysteries. We dont know what we find in each zone. There are witches, hentai priests and just good old fashioned pirates. This contrast nicely with trolls, trolls who dont wash blood and trolls who are skinny. Oh, and snek people. The zone design and feel is also just better, the split into different zones also make sense withing the narrative. Kul Tiras is divided into houses which each sit on different zone. <br />
<br />
The big plus for horde zones are loa stories. Not only Bwomsamdi but each one is nicely unique and have strong personality. <br />
<br />
This is of course all subjective. My overall feeling was just being tired after leveling my hordie. I know what i will face even before i set foot in zone. There are blood trolls and there are rebel trolls with snek. There is no sense of mystery (except for the loas). The last cinematic, while presented as high stakes encounter is totaly meaningless for us because we were spoiled. Yeah, we will raid G'hunn ass. Yes we will raid Zul ass. So whats the fucking point? We know the conclusion of the story.</div></div><hr />

Just wanted to let you know the Alliance side wasn’t getting rep for those 7th Legion quests either. I did a bunch of them earlier this week when I was trying to finish the war campaign and they weren’t giving any rep. In fact there were a lot of quests done for the 7th Legion that didn’t have any rep rewards at all. Not sure if those were intended or not, but the 3 wanted quests I did on Tuesday definitely didn’t give any rep when i turned them in.</div></div><hr />

Well, their budget ran out when they got to the war campaign on Alliance. None of the quests have voiceover which IMO is a huge detriment.<br />

This time around, I had to cc and kite even for normal mobs, accidentally pulling more than 3 was either drop combat if available (5 mins CD) or a guaranteed corpse run. The tougher Elites required full CD preparation.<br />
<br />
I'm inclined to believe them that they didn't touch the scaling algorithm since Legion. So it is something else has changed.<br />
<br />
My thoughts? Since I can burn mobs down 100% faster when I have Warmode talents on (many of winch are PvE talents, let's not pretend), probably the base mob health/dmg was tuned relatively higher than in Legion. So if you leveled with Warmode off, this resulted in a truly awful experience for those specs that are already not the strongest in solo content.</div></div><hr />

Yeah I have no idea.

In a way. The difference is that in Vanilla (I only have leveled on &quot;Blizlike&quot; private servers as I started WoW in WotlK it was a different context. Leveling was a game in itself, and took months. In Modern WoW leveling is like a short thing to do at the start of the expansion. It's more a storyline. Some rush through it, others enjoy it at a relaxed phase. But still you have to be ready for raid in 3 weeks, there's alts to take care off, gold and consumables to be made ... <br />
It is just a different game. Which is good, as I get to enjoy both when Classic finally releases.<br />
<br />
What I find baffeling is that there is this long post by Ion saying 'hey, nothing changed', whereas all the players are saying it is incredibly more different than it has been for the last 10 years.<br />

Reading comprehension seems to be a lost superpower these days. I'll spell it out for you. People are discussing leveling, not 120 or instances. It's not 'whoa this is hard'. It's Ion saying nothing changed, whereas people playing the underpowered specs without the warmode locked PvE talents are saying 'you might not have changed the scaling algo, but you've done other things that made it very different from previous xpacs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
First off, most people are objecting to ilvl scaling not level scaling, though level scaling has plenty of issues and only one upside but that saves Blizzard money so we're stuck with it.<br />
<br />
It is not &quot;obvious&quot; that outdoor world trash, which has ALWAYS and forever been trivialized by higher end gear and higher levels need to scale up with both level and ilvl so that they meet some totally arbitrary amount of time to kill.<br />
<br />
An outdoor world dying in 1 second, 3 seconds, 5 seconds, 15 seconds or what the fuck ever never mattered to Blizzard right up until the amount of time they can suck out of players lives became a metric that can reported in ATVI's quarterly reports.<br />
<br />
There is no reason for anything outside to &quot;have&quot; to take whatever amount of time to kill other than the fact that Blizzard finds it desirable for MONETARY reasons.<br />
<br />
The only obvious thing about all these stupid fucking changes is that they save Blizzard money(reusing every zone as max level content instead of making separate content) and allow them to increase time played metrics. Those are the real and only reasons. If you're trying to understand something a big ass corporation is doing and it can be explained by something they report in their quarterly report, then you don't need to look any further at all. ATVI sees value in how many man hours they can report quarterly and you can bet anything that on it's face serves no real purpose other than increasing those is being driven by reasons other than concern trolling about the outdoor content that Ion Hazziwhatever doesn't give two shits about unless it has some impact on raiding and mythic plus.</div></div><hr />

If you're trying to understand something a big ass corporation is doing and it can be explained by something they report in their quarterly report, then you don't need to look any further at all. ATVI sees value in how many man hours they can report quarterly and you can bet anything that on it's face serves no real purpose other than increasing those is being driven by reasons other than concern trolling about the outdoor content that Ion Hazziwhatever doesn't give two shits about unless it has some impact on raiding and mythic plus.<br />
<br />
No, the reason they use ilvl scaling is to prevent/postpone the gameplay degradation of hitting the point where you kill regular mobs so quickly they feel like completely insignificant, irrelevant annoyances rather than a part of the game world. Note that now I'm meaning the weak ilvl scaling they tried in Legion, i.e mobs became, what, 15% more powerful compared to players who at that point was at like 300% the power level of a newly dinged player? But people sure enjoy the willful ignorance and claim things like &quot;mobs get harder as you gear up&quot;. If their health increases by 20% while you doubled your damage, that isn't actually &quot;making them harder&quot;.<br />
<br />
I already know what kind of reply I'd get to this point so I'll just say it in advance, yes regular mobs are meant to become trivial, and that's natural part of progression. What isn't natural about progression is when you quickly become so powerful mobs, even in recently released world content, are so easily killed, deal so little damage, that they might as well not exist at all. Their greatest posed &quot;threat&quot; is to dismount you by daze. Because you're not caught in the &quot;oh crap, now I have to survive this mob&quot;, it's always &quot;oh fuck you, whoever put daze in should be fired *kill mob in .4 seconds and re-mount*&quot;<br />
<br />
And that means that mobs were too weak to begin with. What exactly is wrong with the design that pulling 2+ mobs might be a genuine threat, so that you have to focus, not overpull, manage your cooldowns for when they're needed? That's how it's supposed to be, and that should be the case for a good few months into a new expansion at max level. Once there's been some increased ilvl rewards from additional content, and you get that power surge and those mobs and elites that used to give you a proper fight are now getting mowed down, that is satisfying. It's not satisfying or fun to hit that point with gear from regular 5man dungeons.<br />
<br />
Quoting this part:<br />
Philosophically, we completely agree that progression is an essential part of an RPG experience. Rewards need to mean something, and their impact needs to be felt when playing the game.<br />
<br />
Part of making rewards feel like they have an impact, is to design content so that you appreciate the power gained from upgrades. Going from killing a mob in 2 seconds down to 1.8 seconds however, does nothing in that regard. Because you go from Very Easy to Braindead Easy, instead of Hard, to Medium, to Easy. <br />
<br />
That's why they did ilvl scaling and seemingly have made world mobs tougher than in Legion. Making sure that rewards are actually felt when tackling mobs and other world content threats. It does *nothing* for MAU numbers. The whole idea that Blizzard would use time it takes to kill mobs for increasing play time or &quot;artificially prolonging content&quot; is in itself absurd. No, those things are decided by things like rep rewards, *how many* mobs there are in an area, and how many are required to finish a quest, and about a hundred other subtle factors. Blizzard changing mobs to die in 5 hits instead of 4 isn't paying their servers, but it sure is easier to point a finger at Blizzard for *gasp* trying to design the game properly. Things aren't supposed to be easy as shit just because that let's players get everything done faster.</div></div><hr />

In Legion, the reduction from stat ratings going up wasn't nearly as noticeable as here, and you could go through the leveling process from 100 to 110 at a fairly stable rate. In BfA, as soon as you reach 116, things start going downhill, and the difficulty practically skyrockets with every level until 120, where it peaks to the point where pulling anything more than one mob is guaranteed to kill you. If they could fix that, and maybe tone down the initial stats on 120 mobs so that freshly maxed people don't have to fight for survival, it'd be perfect.<br />
<br />
That's not an issue with level scaling, you're probably doing something wrong in how you play your character if you can't pull more than one mob at 120. Check your talents, and maybe read some guides.<br />
<br />
I just leveled a mage and found it definitely easy, at least until pulling max 2-3 mobs or single rares.<br />
And now at 330 ilvl I can just pull a whole camp with the mount, drop a Frozen Orb, and watch everything die, so character progression goes indeed much faster that mob progression due to scaling.</div></div><hr />

I did a bunch of them earlier this week when I was trying to finish the war campaign and they weren’t giving any rep. In fact there were a lot of quests done for the 7th Legion that didn’t have any rep rewards at all. Not sure if those were intended or not, but the 3 wanted quests I did on Tuesday definitely didn’t give any rep when i turned them in.<br />
<br />
There was roughly a 2000 rep difference between honorbound and 7th legion pre-hotfix. This was confirmed by many many people (leveling both alliance and horde) as well as wowhead.</div></div><hr />

How come we are seeing massive nerfs like this? Didn't they test them during BETA at all? Over 50% reduction to damage is not something you see every day and here we have them for multiple traits?<br />
<br />
I do enjoy the expansion a lot. But man did they drop the ball in terms of World Quests? It's easily the portion of the game that I end up spending the highest amount of time on after release and there are so many repetitive and badly designed World Quests.. Pretty much all of the Tortollan quests are horrible and they are just the same three quests going over and over again. Really?<br />
<br />
The shooting crabs and seagulls one feels horrible. The shooting mechanics in World of Warcraft feels so out of place and poorly done. But the worst one is the one where you have to guide the turtle through the labyrinth. What's up with the crazy amount of delay between button presses and the turtle actually moving? How did this get through quality assurance? It feels horrible...</div></div><hr />

Leveling was easy, playing at 120 is easy. the dungeons don't get challenging until Mythic, which is as it should be - and with a premade group of intelligent people they're only challenging in a good way, not an impossible way. Most complainers are probably just bad or entitled, and Blizzard shouldn't listen to them.<br />
<br />
The thing is three are seriously undertuned classes right now, elemental shamans, feral druid as examples. <br />
<br />
I've leveled 3 to 120 right now and had struggles with 2, with my demon hunter however it was a face roll, so I'm pretty sure the issue is related to bad class design, mostly. Class level scaling is even a thing? That could be the issue.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I like outdoor scaling, because I like actually fighting mobs instead of just killing them with a tag and moving on. Keeps the world relevant, esp as we're only in week 2. As time goes on and power increases exponentially, this scaling will drop off. Remember that your top geared toons in Argus were smashing mobs down much faster than your average ones.<br />
<br />
Scaling works on ilvl bagged and not equipped, because people were removing low-impact items like neck/rings/trinkets to abuse the scaling system.<br />
<br />
And no, flying right now is a shit idea. Turns the game into a drop-in, tag mob, complete quest, drop out affair.<br />
<br />
So, don't remove it because you don't want? Why? What's so special about your opinion?<br />
And, maybe, all this people abusing from the scaling system are people that don't like the system? Have you ever thought about this?<br />
<br />
And, if now you actually fight the mobs, explain to me how allowing flying will make the mobs die faster? Or what prevents people from just get to an WQ area and tags mobs while wait for others to finish them?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaver</div><div class="date">2018-08-27, 03:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Objectivvely leveling felt much tougher in BfA than in Legion. I honestly don't think I ever had to kite mobs or cc in Legion leveling. Just burn them down. And when a pack was accidentally pulled, you blew your CD's on them and that was that.<br />
This time around, I had to cc and kite even for normal mobs, accidentally pulling more than 3 was either drop combat if available (5 mins CD) or a guaranteed corpse run. The tougher Elites required full CD preparation.<br />
<br />
I'm inclined to believe them that they didn't touch the scaling algorithm since Legion. So it is something else has changed.<br />
<br />
My thoughts? Since I can burn mobs down 100% faster when I have Warmode talents on (many of winch are PvE talents, let's not pretend), probably the base mob health/dmg was tuned relatively higher than in Legion. So if you leveled with Warmode off, this resulted in a truly awful experience for those specs that are already not the strongest in solo content.<br />

Dude you can’t use “objectively” and “felt” in the same sentence :D<br />
<br />
Other than that, I subjectively agree with you ;)</div></div><hr />
