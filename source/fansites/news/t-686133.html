WoW Magazine Preview<br />
A preview of the World of Warcraft Magazine (http://www.worldofwarcraftthemagazine.com/) is now available on its official site. So far it doesn't look like there will be anything new announced here but it's still 144 pages of WoW related articles with a nice layout. <br />

Battle.net Authenticator and multiple accounts<br />
One authenticator will be enough for your Battle.net account, regardless of how many WoW accounts you have attached to it. You can even use the same authenticator on multiple Battle.net accounts. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/12025163701-question-about-autenticator-and-dual-accounts.html))<br />
<br />
Block scaling<br />
Players wave the “doesn’t scale” flag a little too often in my humble opinion, but the block mechanic is one in which we do agree it's a problem. Because you block for a flat amount, the damage reduction from block can be enormous when the hits are small and trivial when the hits are huge. I think it’s overly simplistic to just say that damage intake needs to be similar though. Nobody would care how much damage a tank took if the tank had an excessive amount of health, at least until “mana sponge” is a concern once more.<br />
<br />
We also don’t think block is a mechanic that every tanking class needs to be successful. Remember we gave druids their version of block not to solve a mitigation problem but to make the dps stats that were largely unavoidable on their leather gear more attractive for tanking. There are many times when the shield-using classes laugh at block as a serious tanking advantage (say Sartharion and Ulduar). I think it's the subject of so much focus now because of Anub’arak adds. <br />
<br />
Stats changes in Cataclysm<br />
Agility, Strength and Intellect all need to be of about the same value for their respective target classes.<br />
<br />
I don't want to shut down all speculation on the topic, because it's interesting stuff, but do keep in mind that if you think you've noticed a horrible, glaring flaw based on the limited info we've released, chances are it's something we've already discovered and / or discussed. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/22050170158-excuse-me-gc-cata-stats-have-a-problem.html))<br />
<br />
Getting rid of Defense in Cataclysm<br />
The reason we want to do away with defense isn't because it is a &quot;cappable&quot; stat. Hit is interesting in that you need a certain amount but no more and have to make gear choices accordingly rather than just gemming and enchanting your best stat everywhere and using the highest item level piece that drops without other considerations.<br />
<br />
There are several reasons to get rid of defense:<br />
<br />
1) It's a confusing stat with its &quot;cap&quot; that isn't really a cap.<br />
2) It contributes to avoidance inflation.<br />
3) It's not of the same value for all 4 tank classes.<br />
4) If you have a bunch of dps that can't hit, you'll probably just progress more slowly. If you have a tank that can be crit there's a chance you can't progress at all.<br />
5) It contributes to tank scarcity. Ideally an Arms warrior should be able to go Defensive Stance and grab a shield to tank a 5-player dungeon (though not a raid). When every dps warrior (though the same is true of all tank classes) needs a full set of tank gear to tank even easy heroic content, it's harder to fill your Dungeon Finder groups. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/22049520286-no-hit-juggling-if-no-defense-juggling.html))<br />
<br />
200% crits for casters<br />
Consider that one of the reasons casters must talent into 200% crits is to offer more distinction between the damage and healing specs.<br />
<br />
We don't think high crits are a problem. The problem is really that crit chances have gotten so high (in part because we ended up making higher item levels than we initially thought we would when we came up with the rating conversions). (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/22048900177-should-crits-be-200.html))<br />
<br />

Tanking in 5-man<br />
I think there is one place where DKs noticeably and unfortunately take more damage, and that is when overgeared characters tanks 5-player dungeons. The reason is the way block works, where a paladin or warrior can almost literally take no damage because so many attacks are blocked and nothing is hitting for that hard in the first place. One of the reasons we want to change block for Cataclysm is to make it useful when just starting out, when on challenging content and when overgeared.<br />
<br />
I'd be surprised if your choice of tank class really made much of a difference on e.g. Marrowgar. If your tanks seem to be taking an excessive amount of damage, there are probably a lot of things you can be doing differently. None of the current Icecrown bosses present a huge obstacle in tank survivability, though Deathwhisper may challenge your ability to manage adds.<br />
<br />
Now, your choice of *player* tanking may have a big effect. :) (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/21971447874-why-do-dks-take-so-much-more-damage.html))<br />

Tanking without defense stat in Cataclysm<br />
Without a defense stat there should not be a huge gear requirement to tank 5-player dungeons. It would be ideal if say an Arms warrior could go Defensive Stance, maybe use a shield, and be able to fill the tank role in any normal dungeon or even the easier heroics.<br />
<br />
You will still likely need a Prot-spec warrior (or the equivalent of other classes) to MT actual raids. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/22048470286-lfg--cat.html))<br />
<br />
Protection in PvP<br />
Prot in PvP is something we're keeping an eye on.<br />
<br />
So far, it doesn't seem like Arena teams are stampeding towards Prot the way they did Ret and Unholy when those specs were overpowered. Now, representation is not a great way to balance, but it can be a good red flag. We're also likely to nerf specs even if they aren't highly represented when they are just really annoying to play against or are capable of success without a great deal of skill.<br />
<br />
Nerfing Prot isn't something we'd do without a lot of thought. There are no easy knobs to tweak. We'd have to be very careful about nerfing their survivability to avoid PvE consequences. We could nerf their damage, though we've also taken great pains to boost tank damage overall as a way of making the dps stats on tank gear more attractive, letting tanks feel like they are contributing more to their group, and just because it's fun. (If you are asking yourself why tanking needs to be fun, you might want to ponder that question next time you're waiting for your Dungeon Finder group to fill.) Finally a lot of the utility we added was to make tanking more dynamic so that tanks were doing something besides just spamming their defensive and threat moves. Sure Warbringer doesn't have a big role on many boss fights, but it can be really useful on all of those encounters leading up to the boss fights. We don't want the tanking trees to be 25-30 talents of nothing but &quot;you take less damage.&quot;<br />
<br />
Furthermore, it's clear some players' reaction is just that &quot;Prot has no place in PvP&quot; even though we've been pretty consistent about saying we'd like to get all 30 specs viable. Make sure you're commenting on the actual effectiveness of Protection PvP and not just complaining because you see people using the spec at all. <br />
<br />
[...] It's okay to use a PvP strategy based on survivability. It's only a problem if you aren't giving up much damage to go that route. Giving up utility is a trickier thing because we want everyone to have a lot of utility, and in fact the Cataclysm talent tree design is to give players many utility options. Giving up utility almost always leads to a more boring play style. :( <br />
<br />
[...] I used Prot warrior examples, but I was really talking about tanking specs in general. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/22048470262-no-really-why-prot-warriors.html))<br />

<br />
Anyways, I won't complain. Good work as always Boub!<br />
<br />
OT: Taurens totally deserve the 2 new classes. Along with the gnomes, they are the races with the fewest classes to choose from. Pre-LK (Pre-DKs) they had just 4 classes to choose from. I also think that Blizz has justified the new (mark, NEW) lore behind the Tauren classes. If u have no idea about what i'm talking about, go to the horde inn in Dala and pick up the quest from the lone Tauren standing there. (Something about delivering a shield to a wounded comrade in Thunder Bluff) After turning this one in, u will see a tauren approaching the one u turn the q in to. Read their convo, don't just run away immediately like u probably always do... Thinking a bit further, Taurens will have every healing and tanking class in the game. This makes me believe that we will see a lot more Taurens to come in Cata. My guess is that Taurens will become the 1st pick race for tanks in Cata. That is IF they keep the +stam racial.<br />
<br />
Tl;dr: Stop the QQing about Tauren paladins and priests. Blizz has justified their choice in-game via a quest!<br />

Alternatively increased cooldown on stuns, removal of dispel from Shield Slam, or perhaps the complete removal of aoe spell reflect.

Good luck to healers trying to survive a stunlock from a prot warrior with 264ish gear and 2pc of t10 (+20% damage to Shield Slam and Shockwave). Oh well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Blizzard mentioned that many people complaining that they can´t find tanks.<br />
Now they will remove def from items ! Imagine ! A fury warri will be able to tank hero inis. When you switch to def stance you will be crit immun. That will result in many things. First of all I want to know what Blizzard means with many people out of the many playing WoW. 10, 100, 1000 ? <br />
I can´t believe that such a basic Stat for tanks like def will be removed. What is left then for us ?<br />
Why must all chars be so plain simple ? Why do you remove the unique feeling of this game.<br />
It will be interesting to see what will happen in the future to tanks. I have this inner feeling that all plate classes should be able to tank and do damage and all other classes should be able to do damage and heal.<br />
<br />
<br />
That simple....<br />
<br />
In the end I would like to see that all special attacks will end up in one for every function: <br />
<br />
- Damage <br />
- Tank <br />
- Heal<br />
<br />

<br />
Just did HoR with a 40k hp deathknight tank, with my over geared holy paladin, the damage he took was insane, i barely had time to refresh BoL or SS before he went 10k in 2 hits more or less, that be due to his class or its not played correctly i dont know and dont care.<br />
The tank we had before him (also a deathknight) fucked us over and whiped us 5 times before the leader agreed to kick him.<br />
There are to many bad players out there, blizzard cant rely on other players skills cause of a bad tank in that case.<br />
Buff deathknight tanks or remove them from the game. Id rather wait 20 mins extra for a real tank than that shit.<br />
<br />
<br />
I tank my way through heroics on both paladin and DK.<br />
With pala, cooldonws are something you use in emergencies (due to having only one real CD after the last changes, /cheer at blizzard).<br />
On DK, cooldowns are something you use every goddamn time you can. Gonna pull two-three groups? IBF. Want to round up the small golems in HoS for AoEing? Unbreakable Armour. Caster group? AMS up. Your cooldowns refresh fast, USE THEM. Most people don't, and that's why they get stomped into ground/cause healers to nerdrage.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I can see that first 80<br />
<br />
There is a way to fix this, make the instances so simple that even the most retarded tank can do a good job. Then the raids are for &quot;real tanks&quot; who have to know what aggro means and understand how (and why) to use more than two skills.<br />
<br />
Well thats what it's like right now actually in my opinion, only difference is the very confusing and imbossible to understand def cap that you should obtain before even thinking about tanking.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When people (tanks) level to 85 would you rather they: <br />
<br />
a) Had to somehow farm gear for 680 defence (number-out-of-ass) without touching instances<br />
<br />
or<br />
<br />
b) Specced prot or went into def stance and were immediately ready to tank, albeit limited, until they got proper tank gear?<br />
<br />
This will dramatically increase the amount of tanks in cataclysm for dungeons. 4/10 classes are tank capable, There is no where near 40% of the playerbase actively tanking.<br />
<br />
However, if they choose to make a deep prot/other tree talent that makes you crit immune, wouldn't that kind of defeat the idea of a fury warr throwing on a shield and tanking? So i'm guessing they will either add crit immune to frost pres/def stance/bear form and...something for palas. OR. DPS tank-capable classes will have to dualspec tanking to tank, but still in their usual gear (maybe throw on some high stamina trinkets)<br />
<br />
Either way, this is good. This is not dumbing down the game, or making it casual/easy. It's making it better. Imagine if mages had to be hit capped before they were allowed into dungeons... or priests needing 2.5k spell power before they could do their job.<br />
<br />
And the retarded player argument is flawed. They would be retarded DPSing or tanking, both of which could lead to a wipe fest.</div></div><hr />

A starting tank can get enough gear and crit immune in just a few days of playing as his dps or healing spec if he has a few friends, spends some gold and generally does his best to get there.<br />
Back in WotLK release though for a tank to get to crit immune, he needed a lot more effort in grinding gear. I returned to WotLK about 6 weeks before 3.1 with my fresh lvl 80 paladin and it took me about 3 weeks of casual gaming before people would accept me as a tank since I had to have crit immune without sacrificing too much stamina or else I would not even get in a group. And then it took me even more to get decent gear. When I got the def trinket from Naxx my itemization became so very much easier.<br />
Do not compare with the current ease of obtaining gear and getting crit immune. It was still an issue during Ulduar for some people who dropped out def from multiple pieces for superior items (ICC has several items without def as well but even with those you will get crit immune nearly by default in that level of gear (maybe you'll enchant chest for it).<br />
<br />
And those who complained about hit forgot about reforging. Reforging really solves the issue of gear that is subpar because of hit and expertise having soft caps.</div></div><hr />

Its easy to gear up now, but at early beggning of WoTLK getting crit capped was a cake walk. Now a tank need to be crit capped and have more than 40k hp (when WoTLK started something near 25k was enoff) for heroics or you ll be booted.</div></div><hr />

[/old, crappy joke]<br />
At first I could care less about the new race class combos, but it seems people here (for the most part) like them, so I guess its all good. I do feel for the poster that wanted the hoofed races to be a rogue. Nothing like &quot;clip-clop SNEAK ATTACK!&quot; ;D<br />
I'm still on the fence in regards to removing DEF. IMO tanking specs should be able to tank, that's it. The notion that an arms warrior to be able throw on some tanking gear and tank 5-mans doesn't sit well with me (especially since most players are capable of dual speccing, allowing arms players to specc prot). <br />
Making tanking easier doesn't make it more fun, especially in the community that places all the responsibility on the tanks/healers, yet only praises high DPS through recount (though the occasional moment when a tank will out-DPS new 80's is always fun).<br />
Still, if getting rid of DEF lowers avoidance inflation and makes the game less bursty/face-rolly, more power to the Devs.</div></div><hr />

WTF is wrong with being able to tank as arms. At 60, it was extremely common for warriors to tank as arms. It was a little bit harder to hold aggro as arms, but I tanked every level 60 instance as arms, no problem. Everyone sits around and bitches that wow should be more like it used to be in Vanilla. Now Blizzard is moving back towards vanilla style itemization and everyone bitches about it. Seems Blizzard is damned if they do, damned if they don't. At 60 you got gear that had Strength, Stam and Agi and not much of this other bullshit. Defense caps did not really come into play until Wrath. I, for one, am glad that they are moving back to vanilla itemization. Maybe now I won't have to sit around for 20 minutes to find a group as DPS. Retarded people are retarded.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So they want to make it so &quot;anyone can tank&quot; (heroics), in plate and heavy stamina gear.<br />
<br />
It appears that the option will remain to make your tanking easier on the healer through speccing.<br />
<br />
I don't like the look of that because I have to ask &quot;how many people will spec for their team in a 5 man setting?&quot;<br />
<br />
I know I will spec tank, but I feel sorry for healers dealing with people who &quot;take blizzard at their word&quot; and consider speccing for uncrittability an &quot;option&quot; as a tank.<br />
<br />
I'm going to wait and see, but if full on no-dual-spec ret/arms/blood DPSers can viably, as &quot;supported&quot; by blizzard, queue as tank and DPS, thus likely end up tanking.... bad days for healers.</div></div><hr />

Getting rid of defence because it's &quot;hard to reach the cap&quot;....well yeah, that's kinda the point so that you're not ready to tank as soon as you hit 80.<br />
<br />
Also, a point the has been regularily missed by most of the playerbase, is how gear will differ in Cataclysm. Gear now is interesting because there are trinkets with crit vs haste or def vs block etc etc. New gear will only differ in the amount of int/sta/etc that each item has. I dunno about you, but I find that the idea of this sounds extremely boring while gear myself. This game isn't SUPPOSED to always have easy decisions. Do you want to stack armor pen or crit? Be a crit-monster or screw it and bomb away with unimaginable spell dmg?<br />
<br />
Most people back up the decimation of most stats because it makes things so much nicer/easier, but when you have to play a game for sooooo many months between new big patches and expansions, that ease will just be transformed into boredom. I love this game, but I figure that this is just a big final push for Blizz to try and make their playerbase grow exponentially until they release their new MMO.<br />

Getting rid of defence because it's &quot;hard to reach the cap&quot;....well yeah, that's kinda the point so that you're not ready to tank as soon as you hit 80.<br />
<br />
<br />
But the problem with that is how are you expected to get any gear for tanking at 80 if you are not ready to tank? Isn't that kind of counter-productive?<br />
<br />
This kind of mentality is exactly what I hate about players these days, people seem to believe that in order to do a heroic that was used to gear up for naxx at the beginning, it is required to have amazingly epic gear way better than naxx gear in order to tank/heal/dps it.<br />
<br />
I think getting rid of Def rating is a good idea because their are times when getting rid of a blue for an epic actually reduced my def rating below the cap, which is rather frustrating considering all tank gear has D rating. <br />
<br />
As long as they restrict this uncrittable talent to the tanking trees, I actually like this change, it lets us focus on talents we need because tanks have way to many stats to worry about.</div></div><hr />

According to your logic, there should be no decently geared tanks in WotLK. I got decently geared pretty damn fast, ans so did everyone else. There are players like you mention, but from my experience, there isn't enough of them to be of any significance.<br />
<br />
Getting rid of the stats is a huge step toward making the game mindnumbingly boring for people who actually enjoy using their brains. I love comparing stats and choosing what works best for what i want to do.</div></div><hr />

But now stuff can be facerolled and you can gear up in a few days rather than waiting on resets and raid boss drops.<br />
<br />
I had no problem reaching the required def cap and having enough EH - doing heroics like 3/4 days after release day in quest gear and like 1 heroic instance drop and the made shield, we were like omg quick we need an orb for the shield so we can be best prepared for nax, we went in and cleared nax in like 2 nights in the first release week in the same gear. Seriously it's not god dam hard to gear up if you know what you need.<br />
<br />
You don't even need to run any heroics now to be raiding ready, buy the orbs, you can buy IL 200, 226, 245, 264 BOE gear with money it is just ridiculous.</div></div><hr />

Just a thought!</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Yeah, and you know what, you remind me of all the morons pre-WotLK when Blizzard announced their plans for the whole &quot;bring the player, not the class&quot; thing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Everyone can play dps? Wtf?! If you think I'm ever setting foot in a heroic without 3x CC, or with &lt;insert underpowered hybrid DPS spec here&gt;, you are sorely mistaken and I'll feel sorry for all the mouthbreathing idiots who take Blizzard on their word and think this'll be an option!&quot;<br />
<br />
Suffice to say, if someone repeated that today, they would (thankfully) be ridiculed by the community at large.<br />
<br />
Let Blizzard do their thing, odds are it'll turn out for the better. People being able to play DPS if they want to wasn't the end of the world and people being able to tank 5-mans if they want to won't be either.</div></div><hr />

on the same not that ppl dont like dps specs being able to tank reminds me of how many times a see a tank/healer spec thinking its ok to dps. i dont care if your a kitty, you still pull 2k dps!</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">AetherMcLoud</div><div class="date">2009-12-30, 08:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just some food for thought:<br />
<br />
Vanilla WoW: Warriors were tanks, no one else could. When Blizz said they would make druids and paladins able to tank raids in TBC the community pretty much went &quot;inconceivable!&quot;<br />
<br />
TBC: Shamans were the end-all of raiding. Without stacking your raid with shamans endgame was pretty much impossible. When Blizz said with LK you should bring the player not the class (to an extend) the community went &quot;inconceivable!&quot;<br />
<br />
WotLK: Tanks (besides DKs) have to have 1 particular spec, and have to have pretty much exactly the right gear to maintank (btw what's up with people loling at my DK alt tank for not having 40k unbuffed while tanking HEROICS?). DPS complain all the time that a group of 4 (which already includes the healer that they sought for half an hour) has to wait an hour to get a tank for a heroic. Yet when Blizz says in Cata you'll be able to tank heroics without a dedicated spec and/or dedicated equip, the community goes &quot;inconceivable!&quot;<br />
<br />
P.S. In before &quot;You keep using that word. I do not think it means what you think it means.&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
Blade Barrier (5/5)<br />
-Your weapons are coated in unnatural scourge-frost, reinforcing them and allowing you to perform blocking maneuvers using your weapons. Increases your block chance by 1/2/3/4/5%.<br />
<br />
You get evened out statistics-wise with the other tanks and now even gain some benefit from gear with SBR and SBV.<br />
<br />
This is just a mechanics thing (so &quot;qq tank flavor qq&quot; doesn't apply), and aesthetically you're still using a big 2H or DW.<br />
<br />
OR,<br />
<br />
Maybe it could be Savage Defense inspired:<br />
<br />
Blade Barrier (5/5)<br />
-Whenever you use Death Strike, Obliterate or Scourge Strike you gain the Blade Barrier effect, reducing the damage of the next blow received by 25%.<br />
<br />
Tune to proc with similar frequency to Savage Defense.</div></div><hr />

Consider that one of the reasons casters must talent into 200% crits is to offer more distinction between the damage and healing specs.<br />
<br />
We don't think high crits are a problem. The problem is really that crit chances have gotten so high (in part because we ended up making higher item levels than we initially thought we would when we came up with the rating conversions)<br />
<br />
So what's a Mage's healing spec, then? Just kinda curious, maybe help smooth out que times for them....</div></div><hr />

<br />
Blizzard mentioned that many people complaining that they can´t find tanks.<br />
Now they will remove def from items ! Imagine ! A fury warri will be able to tank hero inis. When you switch to def stance you will be crit immun. That will result in many things. First of all I want to know what Blizzard means with many people out of the many playing WoW. 10, 100, 1000 ? <br />
I can´t believe that such a basic Stat for tanks like def will be removed. What is left then for us ?<br />
Why must all chars be so plain simple ? Why do you remove the unique feeling of this game.<br />
It will be interesting to see what will happen in the future to tanks. I have this inner feeling that all plate classes should be able to tank and do damage and all other classes should be able to do damage and heal.<br />
<br />
That simple....<br />
<br />
In the end I would like to see that all special attacks will end up in one for every function: <br />
<br />
- Damage <br />
- Tank <br />
- Heal<br />
<br />
One button.. That will make that game so simpel as it has to be.<br />
<br />
Right, because itemization plays such a huge role in the game right now. It is a difficult aspect of the game: &quot;Do I want to mindlessly stack stamina for this piece of tank gear, or mindlessly stack stamina for that piece of tank gear?&quot;. Defense just came with the gear, removing it won't affect the difficulty of the game AT ALL. The same way getting mounts at an earlier level had no effect on the DIFFICULTY, just the amount of time spent with the num lock key on...</div></div><hr />

Tauren Paladin is COOL! Thats the most perfect races+classes combination and the 2nd was Undead Hunter. Having those broad shoulders and big chest of the Tauren make them more appropriate to be paladin. And to other forums Tauren Paladin is the most pick if the Cataclysm launch.. :)</div></div><hr />
