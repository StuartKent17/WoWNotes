<br />
This is a pre-expansion Blizzcon and we probably won't see a lot of omgawesome announcements. However, I wouldn't be surprised if the &quot;Cinematics: Cataclysm&quot; was the first screening of the Cataclysm cinematic, that would explain why they encrypted movies in the game files to prevent datamining. <br />

Like they'd include it in their published schedule to spoil it before the whole event.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, they don't publish such things in the schedules. They simply have fake entries that can easily be removed or merged with another event - such as:<br />
&quot;Starcraft 2 Custom Maps&quot; panel on main floor.<br />
&quot;Warcraft Quests and Lore&quot; dev panel.<br />
&quot;Starcraft 2 Cinematics&quot; panel - Also, easily mergeable with the &quot;Starcraft 2 Art&quot; panel.<br />
&quot;Starcraft 2 Secrets of the Masters&quot; and &quot;Starcraft 2 Story Q&amp;A&quot; - easily mergeable<br />
Second day: 3 HOURS of &quot;Warcraft Open Q&amp;A&quot;<br />
<br />
I'm not saying any of these aren't relevant, just that many could be merged with other panels easily. There may not be any major announcements this year as there's already three products coming - Starcraft 2 Exp, Diablo 3 AND Cataclysm - but don't worry, there's certainly room if they want to include something. :)</div></div><hr />

Blizzcon will be on the west coast of the United States, in California, which is 8 hours behind Portugal. (So a panel at 1200 in California will be 2000 in Portugal.)</div></div><hr />

Wonder if they wont reveal the 5th character in the q/a -ppl will be asking about it, thats for sure. Anything is better then the utter silence which have been the d3 feeds for a year or so. Im starting to &quot;hide&quot; the game in the back of my head - dont want to look foreward to a game which might be released in 2013-2014.<br />
Allso what about &quot;Hydra&quot; or what the new mmo is called - i wonder how far that is i production. And if WoW is turning into a gameplay lab for this future mmo release.</div></div><hr />

Maybe it is more about my hopes.. but whole start on the development stage seems suspicious. Starcraft went out few months ago and works on expansion started recently, It would be stupid if they would show us some new cinematic from Starcraft expansion and spoiling the story ..or .. they really want show us old cinematics? Or making of? Did they ever made this? <br />
<br />
And second part.. Secrets of the masters.. If this is not hint of something really BIG.. I can't imagine how hinting of some big announcement would/should looks like.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I think France and Portugal are about in the same timezone, so just go from this.<br />
<br />
Anyway, i think Blizzard wil pop up a few nice things on Blizzcon, they may no be showing on the calender but they will be there.</div></div><hr />

Funny, the things you mention I never experienced last year, guess the problem was at your end and not Blizzards.. ;)<br />
<br />
Anyways, when will we be recieving our notification if we like I did ordered the Live Stream? <br />
And I assume that Portugal is same time diffrence as Denmark.. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Funny, you are one of the only people that did not experience those problems, read last year's live topic and rayv forums and you will see the thousands of comments about it. This makes me fairly sure that the problem was not at my end.<br />
<br />
By the way, your first comment makes me fairly sure that you did not see the livestream _at all_ last year; if you did you wouldn't say it was Blizzard, because the ordering process and the confirmation emails made it _very_ clear that the livestream was hosted by RayV and not by Blizzard.<br />
<br />
Your question after that makes me 100% sure that you did not watch it last year and you are just trolling, because you would know that you receive the login details about 3 days before the event like last year.</div></div><hr />

anyone know if there is gonna be a way i can watch all the panels on a diff day??? (i.e Day off)<br />
<br />
If you order the Live Stream, they also record all panels so that you can watch them On-Demand for up to a week after the event.<br />

Meh I thought about paying for the online streaming and whatever, but really. Why bother, all the information will be on various sites right away anyway, so in the end it would be an overpriced ingame pet you paid for.<br />
Would love to go to blizzcon, but it's just too far away. Especially for such a short event.<br />
<br />
Most websites only post the raw details.<br />
<br />
They always leave out little bits (that you may or may not care about).<br />
<br />
Plus, some websites mis-interpretate what is said.<br />
<br />
This is why i like to watch it first hand.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Of course its for the ingame pet. Its an awesome pet, and seeing as how last years blizzcon pet is selling 90$+ its not a bad investment if you decide not to use it. I don't see why you wouldn't get the stream. And it allows me to use the Blizzon store to buy merchandise.<br />
<br />
And I don't know why everyone is so excited about the cinematic. &quot;OOOH CGI!~&quot; Go watch Avatar... Cinematic=/=Content.</div></div><hr />

I find it odd as well that there's barely any D3 and there's almost just as much SC2 as WoW. Usually, Blizzcon is to hype unreleased games, not one that was released a few months ago. Maybe they're showing the SC2 expansion and D3 is farther off than we think.</div></div><hr />
