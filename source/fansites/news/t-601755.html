US Downtime<br />
To compensate players for any inconvenience caused by the downtime experienced as a result of this week's 48 hour extended maintenance, we will be issuing a 48-hour time extension to all players who have accounts that are currently active.<br />

<br />
I know this post is a few days old, but I guess it will make some people happy to know that Blizzard loves them. But sometimes, love is not enough, and it seems that some realms like Elune (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=1134163498&amp;sid=1&amp;pageNo=1) are unplayable since the upgrade. As you can see in the post (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=1134163498&amp;sid=1&amp;pageNo=1), Blizzard is trying to find the problem but according to the last reply they didn't identify anything yet.<br />

Haste rating changes in 2.2<br />
With the haste changes in 2.2, I thought it could be nice to have a few examples. I listed most of the BC weapons/trinkets with spell and melee/ranged haste rating to let you see exactly how much it changes for each item.<br />

<br />
why? because it mainly affects us (rogues) then other hybrid classes ( warriors, paladins and shamans. :S</div></div><hr />

<br />
Probably won't ever affect 90% of us, except for a trinket or a talent every now and then.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So? It's yet another thing to add to the last. All ythat shit.. it adds up.<br />
At my progression I realy can't see why anyway.. hunters and locks are owning the damage meter whiel offering alot more then a crappy rogue. Seriously.. if I were my raidleader.. I wouldn't bring 2 rogues to pretty much any fight.</div></div><hr />

Who the hell is dumb enough to buy this stuff I wonder... srsly, ok it's cool and all, but c'mon, even 50bucks for this would be overpriced... IT'S THE SAME FREAKING TIGER (just a different color, get real guys)</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's no different from spending a few months in ZG trying to obtain the tiger or raptor mounts. There your $50 in account fees right there. I for one like collecting cards so this is just an added bonus for doing so.</div></div><hr />

It actually is very different my friend, as back in the days, ZG had decent drops for small guilds, and you were doing those bosses anyways, so yea it is different, and not justa bit.<br />
<br />
I'm saying spending actuall money for a different color mount is r-e-t-a-r-d-e-d, it's not like it's going to help you look that cool (you're on your flying mount most of the time anyways outside of bg's, and 500$ is not worth 5x 12y/o a AV telling you &quot;sweet mount&quot;, if you think it is, get a life, a hobby and a girlfriend)</div></div><hr />

All I'm refering to is the $50 you mentioned would be the same amount you'd spend raiding ZG for a different mount in account fees. So if I want to buy a few collecting cards and get a mount in the process, I wouldn't call that R E T A R D E D.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Legionn</div><div class="date">2007-08-21, 03:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh, and btw we will be using our land mounts again once the expansion comes out agian at least for a little while along with any BG we do. At least till they make a BG that will utilize our flying mounts. And I don't care how old anyone is if they like the way something looks and wants to get it they shouldn't scolded for it.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sulika</div><div class="date">2007-08-22, 12:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">These spectral tiger cards are on ebay now, priced $300 to $900. The mind boggles at how people can be that stupid. $900 for an in-game mount?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Legionn</div><div class="date">2007-08-22, 04:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Now I agree with you guys on buying the cards from e-bay. That doesn't make much sense at all, but be a lot of rich kids with nothing to do with their money.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Juju</div><div class="date">2007-08-22, 07:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not gonna lie, I live comfortably, but 500 $ for a color? I can get a paint job on my car for that!</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">capoil</div><div class="date">2007-08-22, 12:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't have the money to pay 500$ for the tiger but I wouldnt say its ''retarded''. People can spend their money the way they want. If you have that much money to spend for this mount, nice for you.<br />
<br />
Most of ppl in this game play to get better gears and better gears and its fine. For those, a mount that doesnt offering any improved stats is a complete lost of time/money. But there are others players that like to improve the look of their character (the netherdrake mount is a good example).<br />
<br />
I can already see all the suckers that will flame the first guy they will see with this mount on their server and all the kiddo whispering ''WHERE DO YOU GET THIS MOUNT ZOMG ITS SO FUGGIN COOL PLZ PLZ IM BEGGING U TELL ME WHERE YOU GET THIS ONE!''.<br />
<br />
Having a quite unique item in WoW seems to be more a curse than something ''cool''.<br />
