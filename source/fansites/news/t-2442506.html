The next PTR build includes some changes to Shadow Priest with the following goals:<br />
<br />
Make Voidform matter more, make staying in Voidform longer matter more, and give the player more agency over extending its duration Improve Shadow’s defensive power and utility<br />
<br />
Make Voidform Matter More<br />
Moving into Battle for Azeroth, we consciously reduced the maximum power of Voidforms, for the purpose of evening out Shadow’s heavily backloaded Voidform cycle damage. This had some positive impacts, which many of you are aware of – mainly this greatly reduced the harsh penalty for dropping out of Voidform early – a common occurrence in any content outside of raids, including dungeons or questing. That said, we think we went a little too far with peeling power off of Voidform, which has resulted in Voidform not feeling impactful enough, and with not enough reason to work to extend it. We are easing this change back a bit:<br />
<br />
<br />
Voidform increases spell damage by 20% (up from 10%) Insanity drain increase per second in Voidform reduced by 15% Void Bolt Insanity generation increased by 25%<br />
<br />
Dispersion<br />
Dispersion’s damage reduction has been increased to 75% (up from 60%). We agree that because it comes with the penalty of not being able to cast spells, it deserves to be stronger. Additionally, it now increases movement speed by 50%.<br />
<br />
A new talent Intangibility replaces Mania (which was similar to and far less popular than Body and Soul), and reduces Dispersion’s cooldown by 25% and causes it to heal you for 50% of your maximum health over its duration.<br />
<br />
Shadowform’s Physical Damage Reduction<br />
Shadowform's 10% physical damage reduction was intended to feel like a bonus to Shadowform, but instead felt like a penalty to Voidform, since you lose that defensive benefit going into Voidform.<br />
<br />
We’re replacing this bonus from Shadowform with the Focused Will passive (which the other two Priest specs already have), causing melee abilities and attacks to reduce all damage taken by 15% for 8 sec.<br />
<br />
Hallucinations<br />
Hallucinations (the PvP talent) is becoming a baseline passive, and allows your successful Dispel Magic, Mass Dispel, Purify Disease, Vampiric Embrace, and Power Word: Shield casts to generate 6 Insanity (same amount per cast as your filler, Mind Flay).<br />
<br />
This give you more freedom to use your on-global cooldown utility buttons, especially in Voidform, without incurring as much damage loss, since Insanity is constantly draining.<br />
<br />
Other talent adjustments worth mentioning:<br />
<br />
Mind Bomb and Psychic Scream now take 40% longer to break from damage. Void Torrent generates 30 Insanity over its duration and deals 20% increased damage. Additionally, no longer requires Voidform to cast, so you can choose to use it on a priority damage target at any time. Lingering Insanity fades every 3 sec instead of every 2 sec. Surrender to Madness cooldown reduced by 33% and penalty duration reduced by 50%.</div></div><hr />

Respectfully disagree. The voidform changes were really what broke spriests compared to Legion - and I think most people considered Legion spriest to be one of the better iterations of the spec. This is a welcome change and while I'd still like to see more, it's a good start.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yamuri</div><div class="date">2018-10-23, 02:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's.... a step. Though I wish they would pay more attention to the rotation like void bolt and mind blast hitting cooldown at the same time, or having it hit during GCD. Just a few tweaks would make it great. Asking for a lot I suppose. I use Mania, I find it far more useful during certain fights like Mother where it lasts longer than Body and Soul. Interesting to see mobility sacrificed for a survival talent.</div></div><hr />

Yup. I wish they had removed Void Form, personally. I really kind of hate it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I wonder if they would ever consider a new version of Mind Flay while in Void Form, perhaps something that can be cast while moving, so we're not so gimped on heavy movement fights? With so much damage being baked into Void Form it's really frustrating to lose a bunch of stacks due to unavoidable mechanics. Wishful thinking I suppose.<br />
<br />
Now they just need to give the talents a look-over. SWD really should be baseline and I think Surrender to Madness has outlived it's memehood.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Legion s. priest was still disastrously bad in any form of content outside (most) raid bosses. Incidentally, I had the pleasure of doing several 20+ keys with the world number 1 shadow priest in Legion. The guy was amazing, and his damage output was amazing, but if you compared what he could do to, say, any world top 100 of the better m+ specs, it was no comparison. Add on to that the fact that he brought almost no significant utility and you had a world-class player that any sane competitive m+ group leader would never, ever take over a mage/hunter/lock/boomkin. <br />
<br />
Legion s. priest was train wreck. BfA shadow priest is just a train wreck carrying manure and explosives - it doesn't make Legion s. priest a good spec. I completely agree with others that shadow needs a ground-up rework to give it more frontloaded damage and more utility.<br />
<br />
We simply don't play a game where ramp DPS specs are a viable form of gameplay anymore. They will always be undesirable for m+ and PvP, and if you reward their ramp up, they will always be OP in raids.</div></div><hr />

<br />

Moving into Battle for Azeroth, we consciously reduced the maximum power of Voidforms, for the purpose of evening out Shadow’s heavily backloaded Voidform cycle damage.

<br />
The class just feels bad right now. You can't really stay in voidform for long, and the frantic fun of holding voidform in Legion is nonexistent, as well as the enjoyment of the multidotting gradual damage spec a lot of people miss still being absent. This is just covering a pile of shit with a nice coat of paint. I don't care if my DPS is high, the class still isn't going to feel right.<br />
<br />
I like the changes, don't get me wrong, but they're really not going to fix how bad the class feels to play right now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No that's perfect. I mean, we lacked survivability and movement, so their solution was to put Legion's Dispersion artifact passive into a talent which they place into the movement's row (which is now, ironically, only containing one movement buff).<br />
<br />
Makes 100% sense. Now we have the choice, either we survive, or we move approximately faster. But never both.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But in this case it's different. They told us before BFA release that shamans and spriests needed more than just numbers and they couldn't do it before BFA released and told us it would happen in 8.1. So here we are, 8.1 on the PTR and they are just doing numbers, which is something they could have literally done before BFA released.<br />
<br />
So I don't care if it's &quot;rare&quot; for them to do design changes during an expansion, they have to do it NOW. Blizz better stop acting like they are an indie dev trying to release a game on steam from early access.</div></div><hr />

First off no need to insult a games company grow up.<br />
<br />
Second if they give you all that utility back then bring it back for other specs. Every spec has been pruned (not just priest specs, every spec of every class).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Now the bad part, not a single issue with Shadow is addressed, to any degree, either directly or indirectly, by any of these changes. <br />
These changes have been deliberately selected to avoid fixing a single problem with the spec. <br />
<br />
Let's review: <br />
<br />
1. Ramp-up is too long and not rewarding = no change<br />
<br />
2. Mind Blast &amp; Void Bolt cooldowns are a total disaster = no change<br />
<br />
3. Our DoTs are irrelevant, we're functionally a Clarity of Power spec (Void Bolt &amp; Mind Blast) = no change<br />
<br />
4. We have no niche to be proud of, we're bad at single target, multi-DoT, execute, and burst = no change (we're decent at AOE trash burst, but that's nothing to be proud of)</div></div><hr />

I'm not sure if we share the same definition of &quot;most people&quot; unless by &quot;most people&quot; you mean you. Most people I talk to and my own personal experience included, think Legion Spriest was the worst iteration of the spec and that Voidform is the biggest reason. I loved the old Spriest and sincerely miss it. Voidform is just a no go for me. I hate it.<br />

<br />
He bought the game, spent a lot of time on his char, and blizzard openly admits that these specs are not done, that they had to ship BfA with some speccs unfinished. Then they promise real design changes/tuning in this 8.1, and they are served this. I feel really bad for these specs, and my friendslist is growing into a ghost town, and that is not what I want from the game most of us have played for the longest of time. <br />
I want to say hopefully, there is more in mind, something that addresses ramp-up, or at least makes it rewarding. I think the best we can do, is unsub, and come back next year when the game is out of beta, which have worked every other expansion. <br />

If you're served shit at a restaurant you complain and it's either fixed immediately, or you get new food or possibly a discount.<br />
It doesn't quite work like that with a game and a spec so calling someone that passive aggressive guy makes no sense and it's just rude.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The ycould make voidform a powerful cooldown like Demon Hunter metamorphosis... put it on 4-5 min cd, that last 25-30 sec and does huge damage bonus.... and make shadow worth playing in shadowform. Or better put a talent for it, so people who like current playstyle can continue play it and others can chose the talent to make voidform a long-cd powerful buff. Win - Win.</div></div><hr />

But hey, these changes are a good - nay, GREAT start in the right direction! So good on them, and please do keep up the splendid work! <br />
<br />
PS: Anyone think it would be cool if Blizz held off an additional ability or perhaps a few beneficial class changes to priests (That would had been available at max level) til we completed the Xal'Atath questline next patch - then when she leaves us with a 'gift' - brings all those benefits in? :cool: Personally I'd find that pretty cool / feel awarding &amp; empowering to the class (Like the good'ole days with talent point per level).</div></div><hr />

Agreed. Blizz went from saying they were going to do a rework to &quot;oh lets just buff spells and change names and call it a rework&quot;. While damage buffs are nice, the play is just not fun. I wish blizz would stop being lazy and do what they say they're going to do for once.</div></div><hr />

Its never going to happen guys, if you think its going to happen, then just ask yourself, how many times have you told yourself &quot;It'll be better next patch,&quot; or &quot;They'll fix it.&quot; I kept telling myself they'd fix things next time, but when &quot;Next time&quot; morphs into &quot;Next expansion&quot; I just can't take it anymore, good to know there's truly nothing to come back for.</div></div><hr />

This shit is going to make Spriests good and the only reason you don't think so is because you must be completely awful at the game and need to be completely overpowered to even contribute with a modicum of success.<br />

how about our most iconic spell not staying talented? failfish<br />
how about X% heal on dispersion baseline? and not punish our movement boost through shield (extremely determinant whatever the scenario, even more with hallucinations rework)<br />
how about lingering insanity something nerfed but baseline?<br />
how about fix mb vb dumb-design issue? (something that has happened by example on fury warrior)<br />
a long how about...<br />
basically returning &quot;something&quot; from the immense amount of things, totally essential, which, nonsense, have been taken away from a class, resulting in its complete emptiness (of course you can still do dmg... the next step to what they have done would not be able to do it). something that seems to have been carried out by a group of young people who have not entered wow in their lives and deign to touch things that take years as a core of a class or new things that have fitted into it to perfection.<br />
tbh that is only to soothe the current spec, to atleast perform substantially fine out there, cause the spec really needs a core touch...<br />
anyways shadow since bc prepatch (how much time has passed...) and not thinking about change ¡even with only swpain mind blast mind flay baseline!<br />
still changes btw but still mingy</div></div><hr />

IMO, Blizzard decided they could not do a much-needed overhaul that they should have done in the first place, so they're buffing every spell that was deemed weak.<br />
<br />
Think VF is designed to be activated and dropped asap so you can activate it again? They bring back a reason to stay in the form - and make it possible to do so for longer periods.<br />
Think Void Torrent is too weak and too infrequently used? The buff it, make it baseline, AND make it usable outside VF.<br />
Think Dispersion is too weak for the no-casting penalty? Buff the hell out of it, give it a speed boost, and add a talent that gives it a fat heal and reduced cooldown.<br />
<br />
These and all the other changes are good, in that SP damage should move up to a respectable level (honestly, I think taken together, these may be too much, but we'll see how the PTR goes). The problem is they do pretty much nothing to change gameplay for SPs. By far the consensus seems to be that the best SP spec was late MoP, with lots of DOTs and orbs. Why not go back to that?</div></div><hr />

I thought okay Voidform is a Warriors Execute for the Boss of 20% or less health. I remember when S.Priests were just mana batteries. It was definitely a niche, but I was good with that, I am also good with bring the class not the player. MultiDotting as S.Priest was almost Aff.Lock gameplay, and a good priest would make sure everything had a dot and mind sear back in the days. Then it got to a point where things just died to quick so you could not multidot. Then came Mind Spike. <br />
<br />
Personally I wouldn't mind perhaps 2 different play styles for priest. You can go for the Voidform build to try to keep it up, but if thats all you are doing then might as well make it a talent where that is just S.Priest base form and it can do big Mind Blasts with a dot or something. Then maybe the other is more emphasis on dots and returning health/mana with Mind Flay / Mind SPike procs. <br />
<br />
Maybe we should revisit what it really means to be a Shadow Priest roll. I agree with posts here that a complete rework would probably just be better.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They're improving overall survivability for soloing and making Void Form something that's work going into because you can sustain it in open world.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure why people want to ditch Void Form and get back Shadow Word: Death. I mean, I liked SW:D when it was baseline, but I don't miss it terribly.<br />
<br />
Besides, with scaling and mob effective health, it's not really a good execute anymore. I think you'd need to blow the old two-charge SW:D to kill anything.<br />
<br />
It would be nice if it was a competitive talent, however.</div></div><hr />

Yes because that's all what matters, buffs. Don't mind that the gameplay is not improved and 99% of what spriests have problem with are unchanged. We got buff so we should shut the fuck up and ignore that it's still unsatisfying and dull. <br />
Seriously man, number's have nothing to do with what's wrong with shadow right now, at least for people who care more about a fun engaging spec than top rankings on warcraftlogs.<br />
If blizzard completely ignores our problems and complaints and just does some QoL improvements which are minor compared to the downsides to this spec still, well then people are damn well entitled to complain in my opinion.<br />
How can you be so simple minded to think that people's problems are with damage meters only and buffs / nerfs are all what matter.<br />

This is a major patch. This is what Ion kept telling us we had to wait for along with ele shamans/etc. This does not look good at all if we can't expect a major rotational/spec rework until 8.2 at the soonest. Making people wait 6+ months to have their spec not feel awful is really, really bad.</div></div><hr />

While I get what you mean, I will post an unnecessary counter post - which is not really a reply to you:<br />
<br />
There is no player in the world who would enjoy two of their most important spells coming off cooldown at the same time approximately 60 times per boss fight.<br />
<br />
How can they not see this?</div></div><hr />
