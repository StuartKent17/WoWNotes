MLG Announces MLG Voice<br />
As some of you might know, Major League Gaming is the parent company of MMO-Champion and that's why I would like to talk about a new service we're launching: MLG Voice (http://www.mlgvoice.com/).<br />
<br />
&quot;As a part of MLG's continuing growth and expansion, we're happy to present our newest product, MLG Voice (http://www.mlgvoice.com/). PC gamers -- this one is for you. MLG Voice is a partnership with NationVoice, a leader in Voice Over IP Ventrillo servers. Whether you're a World of Warcraft player looking to break into the competitive scene, or a hardcore raider looking to take down some of the toughest challenges the game has to offer, MLG Voice is for you.

<br />
I could always say that you will support MMO-Champion by picking it instead of another provider but the goal is to have people pick this service because it's good, not because they love me. (Because they obviously do... right?) <br />
<br />
<br />
Sounds to me like just another Ventrilo provider, a rather expensive one if you ask me.<br />

The goal isn't necessarily to be the cheapest, but we'll try to be the best. ^^</div></div><hr />

It's not listed anywhere on the site at first glance that i can see.<br />
<br />
Think most vent/TS servers are noticeably cheaper if those prices are indeed per month: <br />
* http://www.dallasxtreme.com/ : 50 for 9.48* : rather suspect<br />
* http://www.darkstarllc.com/ : 50 for 10.72<br />
* http://www.gameservers.com/teamspeak_servers/ (also vent) : 50 for 11.68<br />
* http://www.instantventrilo.com/ : 50 for 12.03<br />
* http://www.clanwarz.com/teamspeak.html : 50 for 13.95<br />
* http://www.mlgvoice.com/ : 50 for 18.99, whoa?<br />
* http://www.typefrag.com/ : 50 for 20.00, expensive.<br />
<br />
The images on http://www.mlgvoice.com/ seem very poor quality jpgs, there's a load of artifacts going on, makes the whole thing look rather blurred.</div></div><hr />

While they might be cheaper, they don't do anything to keep this *free* website up and running. And I'll be honest here, I read this website each and every day and I appriciate the work being done with all the patch info and such. It's too bad we just renewed our 6 month contract with gameservers.com, otherwise I'd surely considered this new service.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There was very little information on the website that I could see. The ONLY links were &quot;buy now&quot; under different vent server sizes and some &quot;connect&quot; links next to different server locations for I don't know what.<br />
<br />
No FAQ, no features/specifications list, no &quot;support&quot; link, no forum to discuss it. Seems very &quot;first version,&quot; or maybe &quot;rough draft&quot; to me.</div></div><hr />

It's a very politically correct statement indeed.<br />
Same as: Best value for your money.<br />
<br />
It's not the lowest price, and we can't really test the quality.<br />
Also, if a lot start using it, there's no real list of features or assurances, such as 99.9% uptime either. Bandwidth capacity?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Boubouille</div><div class="date">2009-05-05, 01:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As said in the original post, this is a partnership with Nationvoice, they're a well established company and are totally reliable. MMO-Champion alone has million of visits each month and is part of an even bigger network of sites, scaling the infrastructure isn't a problem at all. <br />
<br />
Being cheaper isn't everything, the quality of service comes at a price, the choice of codecs might be different between providers, some of them do not have a 24/24 7/7 phone support, the QuickControl software let you manage your server from your desktop instead of your web browser, etc ... <br />
<br />
I'm sure there are tons of other quality ventrilo hosting services out there and the goal isn't to point out every flaw in other providers' offers, but price isn't everything.</div></div><hr />

<br />
However, a brief shopping trip shows that I've been paying way more than I should have been paying. I'd be curious to know what that &quot;Best Price Guarentee&quot; means exactly and then, what those limited time pricing options on the smaller servers entail.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually, that is not correct. They lowered the heart of the deconstructor by some unknown amount. This actually makes the encounter harder, because there will be less amount of HP to allow you to deal more damage to XT himself so it should technically take longer to kill him now because if you have some good DPS, you can probably get close to killing the heart (especially under Heroism/Bloodlust).<br />
<br />

Yea, this should make XT a little harder. Previously we really didn't have to worry about killing the heart, hard mode was out of reach using 5-6 dps, so we could just nuke away. Actually having to be careful and not being able to go all out on the heart should make this a bit more of a balancing act. The fight is def. a bit too easy atm imo, this week on our first shot on XT we ended up losing our top dpsing mage at the beginning of this encounter due to his crappy internet and 1 shotted him with only 5 other dps doing about 3k each, no heroism... and we certainly didn't glide past ignis so we are nothing particularly special.</div></div><hr />

I guess that's fair for people saying stupid things like that. but for crying out loud the umm guy who thinks the reason guilds dont setup theyr own vent or ts server locally is because they arent able , should get a clue before posting.<br />
<br />
first guild i was in had a local installed ts server we all used , was always a blast when he went away in the weekends and his server had crashed. and even more fun when he's brother was downloading pron and the ping skyrocketed , something is worth paying for , for 1 get out of the hassle to have to keep you net and servers up all the time to avoid angry gm's.</div></div><hr />

Technically, unless you acquire the license illegally, you can't run a Ventrilo server for more than 8 people. Do a little research before spouting off, ya?<br />
<br />
<br />
Yup, actually all version of Ventrilo below 3.0 version are illegal and you can only setup ventrilo for max 8 people to have it legaly. For more slots you have to pay.<br />
<br />
<br />
Previous versions:<br />
<br />
Anyone who provides access to a Ventrilo server that is not version 3.0 is committing fraud.<br />
<br />
8 ppl limit is in Licence file when you download server (cba to do it now in work to quote it but if you are interested, its there)<br />
