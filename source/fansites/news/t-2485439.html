It's automatically added to the title by the prefix you have to select when creating a thread.<br />
<br />
If there ends up being a huge volume of threads that make it difficult having them combined, we can split the forums into different regions later. So far we haven't had enough recruitment threads to merit splitting it by region; that's why right now they are combined.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Different team.<br />
<br />
I imagine a lot of the people involved have probably at least looked at Old School Runescape. While obviously Runescapes never been as big as WoW, the growth Old School Runescape has seen since it was relaunched is pretty spectacular and a huge part of that is the communication the OSRS dev team has with the community. They are hopefully taking notes and are planning a similar level of communication/interaction.</div></div><hr />

The whole event was terribly implemented. Blizzard handled the Beta the same way a DK without AMS on his bar handles raiding.<br />

Classic is deader than a gangbanged ghoul at a deadringer party.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Betas are for free advertising since ages, not for bug-fixing.<br />
<br />
Some streamers will report things, most won't (because usually they prefer finding a way to exploit them rather than having them fixed). But 100% of the bugs will make it to live.<br />
<br />
Why tf is there the Twitter interface in Classic ?:D</div></div><hr />

While theres a definit advertisement component, it certainly helps them with bugfixing. Not all bugs will make it to live. You realise that internally, they’re 2-3 builds ahead?</div></div><hr />

<br />
If history has taught as anything, it's that most bugs found by general public during the pre release phases tend to not get fixed. Only the most glaring stuff does. <br />
<br />
Btw, is anyone concerned, that the hitbox issue is not mentioned in the list?</div></div><hr />

<br />
They are rebuilding thing, but other than that, no one knows the code, so we can’t explain. It could be something simple as a waterlevel variable set too low or something as weird as the amount of bagslots interfering with the water texture when a Yeti spawns in Winterspring.</div></div><hr />

Pretty sure people like Esfand , Staysafe and TipsOut take reporting bugs seriously. Asmon is not a &quot;classic guy&quot; like they are , he probably can't even tell if there are any bugs around.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Tipsout thought the lack of quest arrows was a bug :P<br />
Staysafe said he would compile a list of bugs and report them all at once. Could just be something he said he would do, but not actually do, just because people kept nagging him about it on stream.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They don't just send invites based on how long you've played.<br />
<br />
<br />
This is intended to be a small beta.<br />
Do you even have your beta profile updated? Classic is a separate toggle.<br />
Have you participated in other betas and PTRs?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Asmongold admitted that he probably wouldn't be able to tell bugs that aren't immediately obvious like health scaling being slightly off because who the fuck would remember something like that 15 years later. I seriously doubt anyone has that good a memory, unless they're savants or something.<br />
<br />
Like I can remember stuff like quests etc. but I sure as hell can't remember the exact effect spirit had on health and mana regen etc.</div></div><hr />

How about a whole new page for classic like the ones you have for Hots and OW. Not interested in seeing classic-crap on the front page at all...<br />
<br />
HOTS and OW are separate games.<br />
Classic is a variation of WoW.<br />
<br />
No.</div></div><hr />

They have always covered WoW news, even if it was not relevant to the current expansion. Some of us don't care about &quot;BFA-crap&quot; (what a subjective loaded sentence... ew), but you don't hear us complain.</div></div><hr />

Priceless! Thank you!<br />
<br />
I needed a good laugh to jumpstart the weekend. <br />
