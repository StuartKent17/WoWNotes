Find Your Friends Faster with Quick Join in Patch 7.1<br />
We’re making it even easier to find your friends and join them on their adventures through Azeroth with the addition of a Quick Join option in patch 7.1: Return to Karazahn.<br />
<br />
You’ll be able to quickly and easily see friends who have queued for select eligible content within your Social tab (o) in the “Quick Join” tab. You’ll <br />
<br />
also be able to recommend others by using /invite to join the group even if they aren’t already friends with the group leader. Additionally, friends won’t need to leave their queue to add you and will receive a join request that they can accept or deny for each additional member.<br />
<br />
What content queues will you be able to join your friends for?<br />
<br />
<br />
Dungeon Finder<br />
Raid Finder<br />
Premade Group Listings (once the friend has joined the group)<br />
Non-rated Battlegrounds<br />
Non-rated Arenas<br />
World PvP such as Ashran<br />
<br />
<br />
So whether it’s your guildmate, your Battle.net friend, or your Real ID friend, you’ll be able to find each other and take part in a variety of game aspects without the need to ask the age old questions of– “What are you doing?” “Any room in your group?” “Can my other friend join?” You’ll just be able to see all of your friends, see what they’re up to, and ask to join with just a couple of clicks. It’s so easy, a drogbar can do it!<br />
<br />
<br />
Classic Server Update<br />
Hey everyone,<br />
<br />
We’ve seen some talk among the community that you might be expecting to hear some news on legacy servers at BlizzCon, and we just wanted to take a moment to let you know that while we’re still discussing the possibility, we won’t have any updates to share on that until after the show.<br />
<br />
These past few months we’ve been laser-focused on the launch of Legion and getting Patch 7.1: Return to Karazhan ready to go (it’s almost here!), as well as prepping for BlizzCon—which is always a huge undertaking itself. You’ve heard us say that the launch of Legion was just the beginning of the story we want to tell in this expansion. What we will focus on at BlizzCon is how the team is committed to making sure we bring you a steady stream of content going forward, and we can’t wait to share what’s next for Legion.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your patience, and we’ll see you at BlizzCon.<br />
<br />
-J. Allen Brack and the World of Warcraft development team</div></div><hr />

mmmm pass the salt<br />

anyway im not betting on classic servers anytime soon but there is a portion of the community that would pay for it and seeing how blizzard is a business and likes to, ya know, MAKE MONEY seems like they would be open to the idea.</div></div><hr />

This wasn't available in Warlords, and I could have sworn I heard them say they would open this up for Legion since there are tons of guilds out there who need to fill the last few gaps for mythic raids. Going to 15-man mythic raids would be incredible.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also that 1 world boss per week is lame, considering none of my 3 chars that have killed all world bosses since the first one haven't gotten a single piece of gear from them yet, even with bonus rolls. 2 or 3 world bosses would be better. Even WOD had that many.</div></div><hr />

No, it should be a true classic server. You know, removing the rose colored glasses and really re-living how shitty the game was in vanilla.

<br />
Yes, definitely a &quot;classic&quot; server. Make it real vintage without even BWL or AQ or Naxx 40, hehe. Na...fully patch with Naxx would be ok. <br />
<br />
That said, I don't think the game was shit, we just had no comparison to the QoL that we have now. And people do enjoy the game as it was, as Nostralious (or whatever that server was called) showed - with like-minded ppl of today.<br />
<br />
Hungering Claw in EU as well.</div></div><hr />

And still not enough people to justify taking attention off of the present and future of the game. 200k people out of even 8m is still a small percentage. Plus, out of those 200k, how many do you think will still be playing classic servers after two weeks? It's pretty common knowledge that the average WoW player has the attention span of a fly.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Mythics with no LFG are thanks to those people who complained to Blizzard for years about how LFG kills social gameplay, how people do not care to perform or behave because they will not meet with that same group again. Even though some of these claims are valid to some extent, I always said that LFG is not worse than random matchmaking made by players using chat/custom lfg. I did some Mythics and most people do not talk, many just rambo everything (cc lies dead, interrupt is miracle, ppl stand in harmfull-abilities 5sec etc), I never met these people again, so alike to LFG. Yet some (especially here on mmo champion) complained so much about LFG, so now I hope they are happy with mythic only dungeons;). <br />
<br />
Btw mythics of first level are just a little harder than heroics, not as hard as dungeons back to BC or begining of Cataclysm where interrupts, aggro managmenet and cc were cruicial for group surviwal. It is not that hard to get a mythic dungeon group if you are healer or tank, otherwise yeah it can be a bit annoying because you have to pay attention or fish for group for some time(still better than 1-2 hours of standing and &quot;shouting&quot; in SW during BC).</div></div><hr />

And when nobody else gives a shit, Blizz can safely shut it down, saying they at least tried.<br />
<br />
I don't know it'll be funny when people bitch that.. (all based on QQ from WoD and Legion)<br />
<br />
Naxx attunment is gating content, I shouldn't have to grind rep, gold and green crafting mats that rarely drop to do an instance<br />
Ony attunment is unfair to horde<br />
Hydraxian Waterlords rep is obnoxious, why do I need it to get an item to douse the flames in MC..<br />
WTF is this scepter crap I want AQ NAO! Stop time gating content.<br />
You mean I actually have to ask people on my server in one chat channel in a one city for a group then travel all the way by ground mount to the instance and then wait for other people to come (summoning stones weren't in classic) there and then one person's cat catches fire and leaves before the entire group gets there I now have to do the whole thing again? WTF blizzard?<br />
What is this resistance gear? Why are you gating content behind resistance?<br />
You mean I need alchemy and crafting to progress?<br />
OMG BLIZZARD WTF I have to have my mounts in my bag?? And they cost so much gold! AND I need to turn in an obnoxious amount of cloth to get one of the other races' mount on my own faction.<br />
WHY CAN'T I FLY Q_Q<br />
I can only play for 15 mins a day why does AV take so long?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, and rogues are, before this nerf, already behind the medium tier, so why nerfing them when buffing a class, saying they dont survive well, when theyre already performing better :/ i know its for nerfing the RMP in v3 but shit, rogue dont all play in v3, and pvp dont only consist on v3...</div></div><hr />
