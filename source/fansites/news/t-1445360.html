The mount that Zarhym teased earlier looks like the icon. It's obvious they are connected. I also believe it is for the WoD CE reward.<br />

Based on the copy/paste string the used I would assume the Raven Lord Mount and Pet you see listed are the CE items. Would make even more sense because they said once you pre-order the Digital version you get the pet, mount and free 90 right off the bat instead of waiting for launch.</div></div><hr />

Pretty much this. For some reason it says &quot;Summons and dismisses an Imperial Quilen&quot;, which was the CE mount for MoP, mmyes? Not to mention a new pet, Dread Hatchling is being implemented which further proves that it's for the CE as we are gonna get both mount and pet (if my memory serves me right Blizz said we were getting mount and pet, and that's what we got for MoP aswell). And Blizz also said we were getting the CE in-game goodies with the preorder if I'm not mistaken, which could mean pre-order is on the horizon.<br />

No it's not. It's a new model, new texture. THE SKELETON itself is reused. Want to know why? BECAUSE IT TAKES A LOT OF TIME TO MAKE NEW SKELETONS. They have been doing this since BC.</div></div><hr />

It suits this mount perfectly. Don't like it? Well it is optional purchase. If they add NEW skeletons and models, we get &quot;Shouldn't they be working on IMPORTANT stuff??&quot;, if they use perfectly fine old skeletons and thus saving time and STILL making the final product look splendid, then they're doing everything wrong anyways.</div></div><hr />

The veteran bonus appears to be a rumored buff to crafting professions for characters of a certain level. For example the free insta 90 or that toon that suddenly will be your raiding main. I have a feeling this will either push or destroy the crafting kit market.</div></div><hr />

Yea b/c it's totally worth dev time to remake a completely new skeleton every time they create a new mount. It looks awesome the pet is awesome and I really hope this is the CE rewards.

If you check out the Dread Raven tool tip they have forgotten to change it from the MoP Imperial Quillen name. This pretty much makes me 100% positive that it is going to be the WoD CE Mount. They also have the Dread Hatchling, and they dont usually make pet versions of mounts for the store.<br />

Still good to get confirmation, though. And this is one Digital Deluxe I won't ignore.<br />

<br />
<br />
I still want to get the MoP Digital Deluxe sometime, though. I like the Imperial Quilen mount, but I just never really felt like spending 15 euros for it. I might soon. However, is there a chance that they'll remove the option for digital deluxe once the WoD normal digital and deluxe digital pre-orders come around? Maybe you'll lose the ability to upgrade from normal digital MoP to MoP digital deluxe. Any word on that? I really don't wanna miss out on the Quilen. :P</div></div><hr />

They are going to make people who have alts that are level 61-85 justify paying for a character upgrade at full price for professiosn's thats shameless in no way does that compensate for a character being boosted from lvl1 to 90 for x ammount of dollars. Obvious they are just being lazy and dont want to program a system to make a lvl based pricing sytem. Its not hard Blizzard take whatever you want for a character upgrade from a lvl 1 to 90 and then devide it by 90 = individual level cost and charge people that cost per level. If i have a level 75 and need another 15 levels its not hard 15 x individua level cost. Trying to make me pay to boost my alts using professions is ridiculous.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If they allow anyone to boost a profession for any character, then I totally agree that the crafting market will be decimated. There is a thriving market for old school mats which in turn keep the cost of mats at reasonable levels. If you take away the market, the mats costs will skyrocket because not everyone can afford or want to purchase a boost. Thus completes the financial circle for Blizzard as it will eventually force all to buy a boost due to either the cost of I game mats or he scarcity of them. <br />
<br />
this isn't buy to win, but it's skirting very close to the edge as it's effect will be to force people to feel the need to buy a boost unless they are happy to farm very old content in order to get the required mats</div></div><hr />

And I think they give a crab about that (Most of the EU realms are dead...).<br />
SoO raid is just so cheap copy-past from other zones... I made a vote about that, and people say this raid (with the environment) is the worst in WoW. Maybe ToC was like that but there was a whole area for it.<br />
Raid finder SoO is so badly optimized... almost on all bosses minimum one or two wipe needed to kill...<br />
I will never understand why they don't give a 553 gear vendor like in ToT with 522ilvl item vendor... The people can get 535-528 ilvl from the island and RF, and they will never see flex or normal because guilds and pugs want 545-550+ ilvl ppl for their raids...<br />
I played almost 2 months and I reached 536ilvl from 496 ilvl. After that I gave up this because I have no more time to play with the random drop genarator...<br />

<br />
Just because you are bad at playing the game doesn't mean getting geared quick isn't possible.<br />
You can get an entire full set of 535 (timeless) gear from farming on Timeless Isle. Then you can fully upgrade all of those 8 ilvls each. At 535 ilvl you can get into most pugged Flex modes and you'd be getting 540 (548 ilvl upgraded) gear. And then on top of all of that, you have 553 crafted epic belt and pants. You can also obtain 553 gloves and legs from the Celestials (522 pvp gear) and 559 Warforged gear from Ordos if you obtained the legendary cloak on any of your characters. <br />
<br />
So if it legitimately took you 2 months to get from 496 to 536 ilvl, you either play the game for like 5 hours a week or you sit in the shrine and queue up for LFR expecting the game to hand you everything for sitting on your butt and doing literally nothing but complaining on the forums. <br />
<br />
I started gearing one of my alts in the past 2 weeks and pushed into Flex and Normal SoO over the past week and I went from 520s to 549ilvl in about 2 weeks. I'm also halfway to my legendary cloak now on this alt as well. Gearing up right now is EASIER than ever.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For the first three expansions, we've had nothing but slightly remodeled whelp pets. In Mists of Pandaria, we finally got a mount and a pet. Quilen Cub and Imperial Quilen mount. How can you really say these are the worst CE items? Even if you don't personally like their aesthetic, it's just disingenuous to say that that slightly altered and heavily reused whelp pet we've gotten every expansion before MoP is superior to a flying Raven Lord mount and pet.</div></div><hr />

I had got only one character with full HOF normal gear at the start.<br />
2months roughly 9 weeks so lets see:<br />
<br />
Celestials: 9 kill: 3 pvp items (useless for me)<br />
Ordos: 0 kill no back.<br />
Timeless Isle: around 3000 kills more than 100 rare kill and only 2 burdens one of them from a chest.<br />
Bonus Coins: 3 RF items what I already got from drop plus one PVP item from celestials....<br />
Valors: I got only 7500 valors in this time. I used to upgrade items with those, but sometimes I got better from RF so I need to replace some of them and upgrade again those...<br />
I could buy only one 553 crafted item for 15k gold because my realm is almost dead, my proffesion alchemy and herbalism, nowadays it is not so profitable: 26-36g/flask etc...<br />
I started to farm gold for the next crafted item but there was no player who sell that one.<br />
So think again that, kid.</div></div><hr />

Well, actually, I humbly disagree -- if an avian were to walk on his wingbones, as protodrakes/firehawks do, I have a feeling it would be very painful for them. Firehawks are sort of special cases since they're, uh, well... Made of... Fire. I think if they had used the standard protodrake skeleton, it would look very uncomfortable/borderline painful for the poor dear. That's just my opinion however!<br />
<br />
Anyway, I will throw my entire bank account at Blizz and buy like 50 CE's oh my god I couldn't be happier. I knew it was gonna be CE, and the pet is just to DIE FOR. I'm... I'm so happy ;_; The only teensy complaint I have is that I sort of wish they'd rigged the skyscreamer skeleton so that its head is more upright; like, sort of how the normal Anzu walks? The more I look at it the less I mind it, but I sort of wish he'd tuck his wings in more and lift his head. But the way he is now is perfect for me, so I'm not complaining too much. &lt;3 Thank you, Blizz.</div></div><hr />

LOL. Let's make the Alliance's defensive apparatus even stronger and more durable. That will fix AV.<br />
<br />
The NPCs at the bunkers are already a PITA to kill, lets buff them ... good luck capping bunkers now especially if Alliance decides to interfere.</div></div><hr />

Why wouldn't you be able to use it? <br />
It has walking animations and is using the same skeleton as the Armored Skyscreamer -- a mount that scales with your riding and can be used in bgs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can use it, but most flying mounts look silly running on the ground, if we are forced to stay grounded i would prefer, and will use a real ground mount.</div></div><hr />

If you read the tool tip it says:<br />
<br />
This mount changes depending on your Riding skill and location.<br />
Rather than<br />
<br />
This is a flying mount.<br />
This is a scaling mount that will work as both a ground and flying mount.</div></div><hr />

If you think about it, that is very similar to the way konami titles their Castlevania series. Which is double interesting since the pre-wrath launch had a Castlevania homage that was in kara.</div></div><hr />
