Patch 4.3 - Deathwing, Transmogrifier, Void Storage<br />
Tom Chilton (Kalgan) answered a couple of questions from Gamona.de (http://wow.gamona.de/2011/08/17/wow-patch-4-3-ein-raid-drei-instanzen-und-ein-wirklich-lang-gehegter-traum/) on Patch 4.3, and we got a bunch of very interesting news out of it. Patch 4.3 will feature:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
New Raid - The Deathwing raid, making it very likely to be the last patch before the next expansion.<br />
3 new 5-man instances - Including one in the Caverns of Time. (War of the Ancients was mentioned as a cataclysm instance a few years ago, but a lot of things have changed since then, who knows!)<br />
The Transmogrifier NPC, which will let you change the appearance of any armor piece on you, while retaining the stats of your current gear. (= T12 stats, but with the Tier 2 look!) <br />
Players won't be able to change the appearance of their armor into another armor type or class armor set, and you might have to own the armor before you can use it to swap the appearance of your existing armor. <br />
The Void Storage is a new type of bank where players will be able to store their old armors in order to free up space in their regular bank. <br />
The Abyssal Maw dungeon is gone for the moment, the storyline wasn't convincing enough/fitting. <br />
<br />

Translation of the original article on gamona.de (http://wow.gamona.de/2011/08/17/wow-patch-4-3-ein-raid-drei-instanzen-und-ein-wirklich-lang-gehegter-traum/)<br />
We're at GamesCon in Cologne, Germany, and just did an interview with Tom Chilton, Lead Game Developer and Chris Robinson, Lead Art Director, in which they revealed a lot of details regarding patch 4.3 - and it seems that the announcement of it being huge was no joke:<br />
<br />
Patch 4.3 will bring us the Deathwing raid instance! This means it's likely that we'll be able to fight the Aspect of Death in an epic encounter within this year. The raid that was originally expected for this patch, the &quot;Abyssal Maw&quot;, was cut from the schedule because, as Chilton states, the setting and the story were not convincing enough.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, 4.3 will also bring three entirely new 5-man instances - Chilton assured us that these won't contain any re-vamped content, but instead be brand new with unique design and models. Chilton also hinted at one of those being within the Caverns of Time, allowing players to experience another great moment of Warcraft Lore first-hand.<br />
<br />
The interview also revealed the purpose of the &quot;mystery ethereals&quot; in Stormwind (and likely other cities, too). The &quot;Transmogrifier&quot; NPC will allow players to change the displayed model of equipment to that of another item while keeping the original attributes: Transmogrification is only possible within an armor class - Plate armor can only assume the looks of other Plate armor, for example.<br />
<br />
Class restrictions apply to Transmogrification - Warriors cannot transmogrify their armor to look like Death Knight tier sets.<br />
The developers are considering whether they should only allow using the models of equipment that has already been obtained<br />
<br />
<br />
The &quot;Void Storage&quot; is a very large bank-esque storage which allows old equipment to be stored, freeing up inventory/bank slots for players. The developers aren't sure yet about the definition of &quot;old equipment&quot;. The cost of the storage (and whether there even is one) is another thing that is not yet decided<br />
<br />
Another possible feature that was hinted at is the possibility of &quot;void stored&quot; equipment being available to other characters on the account (NOTE: That part might be speculation from Gamona, not cross-server transfers actually confirmed. Hard to tell.) <br />
<br />
Overall, it seems that we've got a huge patch ahead of us - a new raid, three brand new instances, Transmogrification and Void Storage.<br />
<br />

don't be daft, people have been requesting similar on the forums for years. Hardly copying another game if you've been getting it as a suggestion from players prior to the other game even being announced.</div></div><hr />

I mean, the armor stuff, great, fantastic, awesome.... I cannot wait for that. But really? Deathwing raid... already? Maybe I'm the only one that feels this way but isn't it a little... soon? <br />
<br />
I'm used to &quot;five-ish phases&quot; of raiding typically. See Wrath: Naxx et al, Uldum, TotC, Lich king, Ruby Sanctum. Or even Burning Crusade: Karazhan et. all, The Eye and etc, Caverns of time, The Black Temple... and then Sunwell. That was five. This was barely one, one and a half, and then... three??<br />
<br />
Heck, I just noticed that today a year ago I was beta testing Cataclysm. It wasn't even released yet. So.... Blizzcon is gonna be them announcing the new expansion, obviously, and beta prep for that....Like I said, I'm really surprised.<br />
<br />
Suppose they're trying ot get more buck out of their bang? Or are they going to try to push the Deathwing raid to whenever SWTOR is announced, I wonder?</div></div><hr />

<br />
We are here for you at the Gamescom in Cologne and just with Tom Chilton, Lead Game Developer and Chris Robinson, lead art director for an interview, in which there were many new details about patch 4.3. And Blizzard's announcement that it is a really thick patch does not appear to be exaggerated.<br />
<br />
Because with Patch 4.3 we do not expect more than the Deathwing Raid. So we will probably later this year to wrestle with the issue of death and it certainly can expect a truly epic raid experience. The raid, which we had originally expected, the Abyssal Maw was, however, removed from the concept to convince there, Chilton, the setting and the story could not.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, this will certainly look forward even more players, there will be three completely new instances. These will include no warm old content, but really completely new and very demanding to be instances. One of them, as far as hinted Chilton will be back in the caves which date back to the player and return it to an old place can be. Ahn'Quiraj is therefore still on the table, it was us but assured that it will act, too, is a completely new design with all-new enemies and bosses.<br />
<br />
<br />

What's up with the Transmogrifizieren about? We will clarify on! <br />
<br />
<br />
And now we come to the dream, which many players have stated repeatedly and with patch 4.3 will be finally coming true. And we can now reveal the secret of the three astral in Stormwind. Because the river will keep Transmogrifizieren in World of Warcraft. What's this? Nothing other than the opportunity to give your current armor the appearance of old armor, while preserving the values. It will be finally introduced the possibility to change the look of our characters. There are some things to consider.<br />
<br />
First, we are only able to change armor class of our armor. This means that you can convert only one plate armor plate armor. Furthermore, you will only pieces of armor to choose which of your class are intended. Death knight warriors in armor, it will not work. And finally, is still considering whether the armor pieces that are available for change, must have been earned himself once. That would mean that we will experience a big run on the old instances, because certainly some players then there are farming their dream armor.<br />
<br />
The Voidstorage was explained to us. It is a very, very large bank, which put in her ancient armor and thus can keep forever. This is intended to provide in the bank and the player's inventory for more space. What items can be stored there, how much will it cost a bank specialist there and whether these items then the other characters of the player are available, that will be decided in the coming period.<br />
<br />
All in all, there really seems to announce a huge patch. A raid, three completely new instances, optical armor adjustments and still has a lot more to come at us. What do you think? Are you happy with these announcements? What instances would you wish for you and what you think Transmogrifizieren? We are very excited about what you think!<br />

Is it just me or does this expansion feel really lack lustre for raids. Started out well enough with BWD and BoT, nose dived into a seven boss raid after 6-7 months of no new content (as one player put it, six new models and a pair of legs), and no doubt another single raid instance with single digit boss fights after another very long wait. Where's all the content? In Vanilla we saw more content from a less experienced Dev team with what I assume was a more limited budget (given that subscribers weren't as numerous). TBC we saw double digit bosses in multiple instances up until the end with SWP. The the decline began in WotLK, first Naxx resurrected (boring), redeemed for a while by Ulduar, then the abortion that was ToC, and finally ICC after a long wait, and it was around for faaaar too long.So many paying customers but so little return...</div></div><hr />

<br />
How on earth does an expansion &quot;only&quot; lasting a year equate to a bad expansion? Since when was a long time span a necessary condition of a good expansion? The only &quot;god damn joke&quot; appears to be your stance at the moment - since you've failed to substantiate it in any meaningful way.</div></div><hr />

I doubt they will have a feature that tracks gear you have looted from the first time you created your character. Will weapons be available to change? It seems kind of odd to only say armor and not weapons. Please say we can use weapons.... I would probably switch to 2hfrost just so I could use my blue runeblade model.

Now if it is going to be launched in 4.3, i might subscribe for a month to see what it is, and if they kept it to the lore, yes, i am a lorewhore.. But only one? I thought they said in the press release that they would do at least 2 and a CoT raid. <br />
Tbh, WoW is too boring to play these days. <br />
And the gear look, the appearances, is something my guild has posted on the forums since Wrath and they finally implemented it.. That is a good change though. Do people need to obtain the old raid items or it is just something you can transform it too?<br />
What i (personally) dont like is the Deathwing raid, i know it's obvious in a game progression point of view but according to the lore, the other Aspects couldnt kill Neltharionand now a small group of normal raiders can kill the Aspect of Death?? Imo they are about to destroy the lore about the best villain in WoW. Just read the War of the Ancients and it will tell you that the Aspects couldn't destroy him but hurt him so that he went into hiding. Now, what i would like to see, is not a kill of Neltharion but that they are forcing him to retreat with so many injuries that he cannot fly or move for another millennium. Deathwing the Destroyer, formerly known as: Neltharion the Earth-Warder, should be a character that should stay alive and in the game. He is not the same as Illidan or the Lich King, but he is an Aspect, unless you get to fight with the other Aspects, you cannot kill Deathwing.</div></div><hr />

Lead Artdirector. They told us much new Details about Patch 4.3.<br />
It looks like Blizzards announcement, that 4.3 will be a really big Patch, isn't overdone (??).<br />
<br />
4.3 will include the deathwing Raid!<br />
We will hopefully fight against Deathwing this year and surelly have an Epic Fight. <br />
But there will be no Abyssal Maw, because the storyline wasn't convincing enough, said Chilton.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, and that will surely makes more Players happy, they add three more completly new instances.<br />
These three will not be some &quot;new, old instances&quot;, but really completly new and challenging Instances.<br />
One of these, said chilton, will be placed in the caverns of Time and let the Players go to an old Place.<br />
<br />
Ahn'Quiraj isn't canceld, and they promised us, that it will have an completly new design with new Enemys and bosses.<br />
<br />
And i don't have enough time to translate the last part, but it is just some Infos about the storage.<br />
<br />
I think the only thing you could add into your Post is the part about Ahn'Quiraj.<br />
<br />
Ahn'Quiraj could be the next Halion, filler patch :P</div></div><hr />

http://wow.gamona.de/wp-content/themes/wow/images/comments_wow.png 15 (http://wowforum.gamona.de/showthread.php?t=118116) We are here for you at the Gamescom in Cologne and just with Tom Chilton, Lead Game Developer and Chris Robinson, lead art director for an interview, in which there were many new details about patch 4.3. And Blizzard's announcement that it is a really thick patch does not appear to be exaggerated. Because with Patch 4.3 we do not expect more than theDeathwing Raid . So we will probably later this year to wrestle with the issue of death and it certainly can expect a truly epic raid experience. The raid, which we had originally expected, the Abyssal Maw was, however, removed from the concept, could convince there, Chilton, the setting and the story is not. Furthermore, this will certainly look forward even more players, it will include three completely new instances give. These will include no warm old content, but really completely new and very demanding to be instances. One of them, as far as hinted Chilton will be back in the caves which date back to the player and return it to an old place can be. Ahn'Quiraj is therefore still on the table, it was us but assured that it will act, too, is a completely new design with all-new enemies and bosses.http://wow.gamona.de/wp-content/plugins/gamtags_pro/$static/image/d/4e8/140-c8/bceabb432f1617746e142246db3a66e5.jpg (http://wow.gamona.de/wp-content/gallery/patch-4-3/wow_astrale_august_2011_01.jpg)<br />
What's up with the Transmogrifizieren about? We will clarify on!And now we come to the dream, which many players have stated repeatedly and with patch 4.3 will be finally coming true. And we can now reveal the secret of the three astral in Stormwind. For theTransmogrifizieren catchment will hold in World of Warcraft. What's this? Nothing other than the opportunity to give your current armor the appearance of old armor, while preserving the values. It will be finally introduced the possibility to change the look of our characters. There are some things to consider.First, we are only able to change armor class of our armor. This means that you can convert only one plate armor plate armor. Furthermore, you will only pieces of armor to choose which of your class are intended.Death knight warriors in armor, it will not work. And finally, is still considering whether the armor pieces that are available for change, must have been earned himself once. That would mean that we will experience a big run on the old instances, because certainly some players then there are her dream armor farms. The Voidstorage was explained to us. It is a very, very large bank, which put in her ancient armor and thus can keep forever. This is intended to provide in the bank and the player's inventory for more space. What items can be stored there, how much a bank specialist will cost there, and whether these items then the other characters of the player are available, will that be decided in the coming period. All in all, there really announcing a huge patch. A raid, three completely new instances, optical armor adjustments and still has a lot more to come at us. What do you think? Are you happy with these announcements? What instances would you wish for you and what you think Transmogrifizieren? We are very excited about what you think! The video of the interview is currently still in the cut and we will inform you immediately of course, if it's there! Until then, enjoy debate</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nam</div><div class="date">2011-08-17, 12:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Translation of the article (quick and dirty):<br />
<br />
<br />
We are at the Gamescon in Cologne and just finished our Interview with Tom Chilton, Lead Game Developer, and Chris Robinson, Lead Art Director, which brought many new details to patch 4.3. Blizzards announcement about 4.3 being a quite huge patch don't seem exagerated.<br />
<br />
Patch 4.3 will await us with the Deathwing Raid, so we will probably engage the Aspect of Death before the end of the year which will most certainly be a very epic raiding experience. The raid we actually awaited to be announced, the Abyssal Maw, has been taken out of the concept because, so Tom Chilton says, neither the setting nor the story were really convincing.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, and this will for sure be good news to even more players, there will be three brand new 5-man instances. It won't be recycled old content but completely new and very challenging. One of them, so Chilton let us know, will be located at the caverns of time, letting people experience an area from the past. So Ahn'Quiraj is not really off the table yet, but we were assured that it's a completely new design with new monsters and bosses. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
And now for the dream many players suggested again and again and that will come true with patch 4.3. The secret about the three ethereal guys in stormwind has been lifted, Transmogrifying will come into the World of Warcraft! What's that? It's the ability to change the appeareance of your current armor to the look of older armor parts (without changing the stats). So this is finally an opportunity to change the appeareance of your character. There are some things to keep in mind, though.<br />
<br />
First, only armor of our own armor class will be changeable (better: targetable?). This means that plate armor can only be changed to plate armor and so on. The same is true for class restrictions, so no warriors in death knight armor, sorry. Finally they are still figuring out whether or not you actually have to possess the armor whose look you take over (meaning you can only transform into t3 armor if you actually have it in your bank and so on). That would probably mean there will be a giant run on older instances from people trying to find their favorite piece of armor.<br />
<br />
Also, they explained the Void Storage to us: It's a very, very huge bank to deposit old armor forever (I don't get the &quot;forever&quot;, will we LEARN them like companions?). This aims at providing more space for player's bank tab and inventory. Which items can be deposited, how much a bank tab will cost and if these items will become Bind on Account or the like will be decided at a later point.<br />
<br />
All in all this seems to be the announcement of a huge patch. One raid, three instances, appeareance changing and most probably a lot more are coming. What do you think about it? Are you happy with these announcements? What would be your favorite new instances, what do you think about Transmogrifying? We would be happy to hear from you!<br />

<br />
If the latter were the case; why would you continue to pay $15 a month for a service other mmos (and countless multiplayer shooters) provide for free? A small fee for maintenance is not beyond the realm of possibility, but I think without the promise of added content patches, that sum looks a little ridiculous.<br />
<br />
While the TOS may not state that your money goes towards content patches; if it were not the case (in practicality) there would be no content patches at all.</div></div><hr />

I'm extremely disappointed in the fact that WotA isn't going to be a raid. The concept behind it, along with the number of true lore-based boss possibilities, was making me giddy.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't discount the possibility that the War of the Ancients raid could still be happening AS the Deathwing raid... <br />
<br />
Deathwing having minions who we need to fight to get to him doesn't make sense in the way it did with KJ or The Lich King as he's more of a loner and there's only so many &quot;other&quot; black dragons we could face...<br />
<br />
I'm betting on the War of the Ancients being the first 5 or so bosses of the Deathwing raid in which we go back to weaken Deathwing somehow and make him killable by us mere mortals, then we port back to the future via Norzdomu and fight the Twilight master (or whatever he's called) and then the now weakened Deathwing.<br />
<br />
The other instances could be about us discovering the achillies heel we could graft onto Neltharion but only in his uncorrupted pre WoA form. This would be the story driven raid instance of my dreams</div></div><hr />

Let's 4.2 stays for 6 months, and 4.3 as well. Then you will still have an expansion with the timespan of a bit more then 1.5 years. Which isn't that much shorter as WOTLK. <br />

We'll say 2 months of 4.3 for a decent part of the population to even get to Deathwing and oh look it's suddenly December 2011. 1 year from Cataclysms release....prettt good mileage from an expansion. <br />
<br />
Now if we go by the leaked timeline from a while back (which has so far been fairly accurate) we'll see the next expansion (likely panderia) during 2nd quarter of 2012. If theres plenty of leadin to Panderia (god there better be to make that work) we could see 5.0 starter patches in March or April<br />
<br />
Who's to say there wont be another content patch after 4.3. Blizzard could add a whole new raid that doesnt even tie into the packs theme well if at all . (see sunwell). Or a storyline raid and some dungeons to clean up lose ends is possible as well, still got plenty of story they can make with those pesky old gods after all</div></div><hr />

<br />
Seriously... everyone freaking out about transmorf thinking it's the worst thing ever is making me laugh IRL. Also, of course they want the new expansion to come out fast. Both because they promised faster expansions, and more-so because clearly people hate this one. WoW has never bled subs this fast so they want to try to stop that as quickly as possible.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dejohn</div><div class="date">2011-08-17, 12:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">How on earth does an expansion &quot;only&quot; lasting a year equate to a bad expansion? Since when was a long time span a necessary condition of a good expansion? The only &quot;god damn joke&quot; appears to be your stance at the moment - since you've failed to substantiate it in any meaningful way.<br />
<br />
Instead of releasing 4 raid tiers we get 3 instead. This makes the value of paying the same price for the cata expansion vs wotlk much worse. It also gives me pause when considering purchasing the next expansion at the usual expansion price. Perhaps people don't want to pay for expansions faster than they used to. Are you a shareholder? The only people in favor of less content for the same price would be shareholders.<br />
<br />
I do however think that they kept people in ICC for far too long. That ruby sanctum was a joke and really they should have launched cata much sooner but they got caught in a release window around xmas being more important than actually giving people a new expansion. This probably had a lot to do with the focus on revamping the leveling experience and trying to draw in new subs. I dont think they were very successful with that endeavor. Still its 4 tiers vs 3. Cant argue that this is a worse value.</div></div><hr />

That's why they rolled back the cloak modifications associated with gnomer / dark spear, and why they changed the MC engineer enchant graphic changing the way your helm looked. Then we get this : /. Flip flop express. All it really ends up being is another timesink for people to go back and farm old raids for gear.<br />
<br />
My call for the 'new' 5 mans are going to be heroic gnomer, heroic blackrock depths, and heroic scholo. I'm just waiting until they announce we can just buy gold and wow items with real life currencies.<br />

just an FYI: Rift didn't start that 'wardrobe feature'<br />

These are just announcements as far as I know and there isn't even a release date for 4.3, neither do we know for how long they are gonna go with 4.3 before they release the next expansion. Let's 4.2 stays for 6 months, and 4.3 as well. Then you will still have an expansion with the timespan of a bit more then 1.5 years. Which isn't that much shorter as WOTLK. Woohoo for Void Storage though, I'm gonna get so much space in my bank now. Can't tell if troll or bad at math... if the expansion is 1.5 years, that is 25% less than last expansion. And I think we'd all be in favor of that if we had the same number of raids/bosses compressed into less time, but they cut the bosses by a significant amount so far.I for one feel cheated this expansion. I bought it expecting to pay $15 a month for 4 tiers plus a holdover instance spaced reasonably in time, just like every other expansion so far. What we appear to be getting is a 3 tier expansion. This change, without front end communication, is boardline fraud in the ethical sense (not the legal sense, I'm sure).Blizzard promised (omg he said promised. announcements at Blizzcon should be treated as formal press releases, so yes, promised) that Cata would have more content and content would be released at a faster rate. So far we are getting less content and more spaced out. It is no wonder that Blizzard is losing millions of customers. They treat all of their customers extremely poorly.</div></div><hr />

It's another great idea they're ripping from another MMO to try and claw people back. <br />
<br />
I don't blame them. It's a fantastic idea. All they need to do now is do a bit of texture redesigning to allow for dyes, and have vendor bought (or even store-bought) cosmetic items that players can use to change their armor. High level players will have the best choice of equipment, but lower level players will be able to customise their characters to look less, erm...levelley. RPers are literally going to cream themselves. <br />
<br />
It's a new feature that still doesn't save a well meaning but terribly implemented expansion though and it's still not enough to tempt me back. I find the community on LOTRO to be far friendlier and more helpful, and it's doing a lot of the stuff that WoW doesn't. Good thinking guys but for a lot of your lost subscriptions it's too little, too late.</div></div><hr />

thats a valid question.<br />
the war of the ancients was BIG, it took place across multiple places and was &quot;kicked off&quot; by the events surrounding the well of eternity.<br />
frankly if they ended up putting the whole thing in one instance(raid or dungeon) it would take hours to cover.<br />

Thats a fair point. They made 1 room that they used for the entire instance other than the last boss which was just recycled character models/textures from a number of other places. They even made a 5 man that used the exact same room but you came in through the side door lol. I think that the content has gotten shittier and shittier since they got activision'd. It also speaks to why these &quot;battle.net Account Bound&quot; items cant be sent to other realms. Doesn't sound very account bound to me. I wasn't aware I had a different account on different servers. It would cut off a revenue stream of people who server transfer with that gear off of dying servers with low horde/ally populations. I never believed for a second that this Void Storage would be anything involving sending BoA gear. Probably time to find a new game.</div></div><hr />

Is it just me or does this expansion feel really lack lustre for raids. Started out well enough with BWD and BoT, nose dived into a seven boss raid after 6-7 months of no new content (as one player put it, six new models and a pair of legs), and no doubt another single raid instance with single digit boss fights after another very long wait. Where's all the content? In Vanilla we saw more content from a less experienced Dev team with what I assume was a more limited budget (given that subscribers weren't as numerous). TBC we saw double digit bosses in multiple instances up until the end with SWP. The the decline began in WotLK, first Naxx resurrected (boring), redeemed for a while by Ulduar, then the abortion that was ToC, and finally ICC after a long wait, and it was around for faaaar too long.So many paying customers but so little return... You'd think that we'd have more capital to invest, but you'd be assuming they are investing in WoW. After Sunwell, WoW was a dead franchise. They've been using WoW to finance all of their other projects. Where do you think they got the money for Starcraft 2? No one was paying for SC1 anymore. Where do you think the money for Diablo 3 came from? D2? Not likely. Titan is being financed with WoW money and a little bit of SC2 money.They're using minimal financial and human resources for this.</div></div><hr />

i kinda agree that as an endgame player the amount of content that has come my way has been lacklustre at best, but we cant forget that 50% of this expansion was the 1-60 content which apparently set blizzard back quite a long way. <br />
<br />
but, as they've now done the 1-60 rehash and brough flying to azeroth, they can focus 110% of their development time on the next expansion into endgame content, so hopefully all the promises they made us for cata that didn't quite come true, will live up to our expectations for mists of pandaria.<br />

DC Universe Online already had it before Rift did<br />
<br />
Oh, and LOTRO had it long before DCUO was even publicly announced.<br />
<br />
And to those posting that the item is destroyed in the process: That would just defeat the entire purpose of the Void Storage system.<br />
<br />
Void Storage = Equipment Bank, so you can store all your gear FOR making your current stuff look like old stuff.<br />
<br />
So happy I held onto my Paladin's Tier 2... Awesomeness shall rise again!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Easiest Aion exploit was skin the tier 2 piece onto a white tradable item, then sell it for some god awful amount of kinah &lt;----HOPE THEY FIXXXXXX THAT ONE!!!<br />

And to add every possible plate drop from 60-70 content that I thought it looked cool. I ended up having a bank with 22 slotters all slots full of item crap, and I gave up on my toon since I thought blizzard would never implement such feature. Now I'm sad :(</div></div><hr />

It better have 40 bosses... - New 5mans - awesome. Those in ICC were great too. However I hope they add normal/heroic version and the HC one is really tuned for like 375+ people. I dunno about 40 bosses, but the next expansion better be free as compensation for ripping us off.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The Void Storage is a new type of bank where players will be able to store their old armors in order to free up space in their regular bank.<br />
<br />
<br />
to use it for....<br />
<br />
<br />
The Transmogrifier NPC, which will let you change the appearance of any armor piece on you, while retaining the stats of your current gear. (= T12 stats, but with the Tier 2 look!)<br />
<br />

so that ppl who actualy ran Nax in van stay unique and ppl that put the effort in getting other sets shows their efforts.</div></div><hr />

For content this expansion has been utter tripe. If they do not make the Deathwing instance amazing, and not a collection of 7 bosses that feature incredibly frustrating mechanics, then Cataclysm will have failed. Yeah, that is one of the major problems with Firelands. The bosses are mostly gimmick fights and burn phases.Rag is alright, decently challenging and fun mechanics. I like the meteor ideas, but I think it works poorly in the shape of the room. The sons of flame thing was pretty good. Gets people to use other abilities they wouldn't normally. The problem there is that it hurts classes without stuns.</div></div><hr />

That's why they rolled back the cloak modifications associated with gnomer / dark spear, and why they changed the MC engineer enchant graphic changing the way your helm looked. Then we get this : /. Flip flop express. All it really ends up being is another timesink for people to go back and farm old raids for gear.<br />
<br />
My call for the 'new' 5 mans are going to be heroic gnomer, heroic blackrock depths, and heroic scholo. I'm just waiting until they announce we can just buy gold and wow items with real life currencies.<br />
<br />
You sir are an idiot!! Rifts wardrobe feature? this feature has been in EQ and EQ2 as well as several other games that came out wayyyyy before Rift was even thought of so no it is not Rifts wardrobe feature moron.</div></div><hr />

Have you played this game since day 1.....this expansion has the biggest lack of content by far making it a crappy one or do you like to pay blizzard for every patch that gets out.....oh i know lets make every patch an expansion of the game and pay for it.<br />
And yea it is a god damn joke and if your brain is that small to realize that pls dont comment . As for the meaningful of this expansion i am lucky to say that i did all the raid content HM (except for firelands 4/7 atm) so again don't talk about my statement if you have no clue<br />
Blizzard is ripping of every buck they can from wow atm</div></div><hr />

At first I thought that changing the appearance of your gear was a good idea, but it's going to end up with every player of a certain class wearing exactly the same set. The Void Storage sounds awesome, I have my bank literally full of crap, but it's not going to benefit me now.<br />
<br />
Blizzard is pushing the &quot;real baddies of the expansion&quot; out WAY too soon. Deathwing already, why!? The Cataclysm content is ridiccious in every way. Rotating old bosses over again. Vanilla was merely a setback. I we've heard that joke enough.<br />
<br />
WoW is dying. Cataclysm was only the beginning of the end. Make peace with your end, for the Hour of Twilight falls!</div></div><hr />

There's no way that the next one will be out before the end of next year, and that would mean another ICC issue where it's the same thing. For a year.<br />
<br />
We haven't had an Old God raid this expansion, so maybe one will pop up after Deathwing, being the one who influenced him and all?</div></div><hr />
