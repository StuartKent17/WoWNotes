Turning exp off is not always helps when you reactivate your account as it just turns it on automatically. if you ever had to dealt with it you would know how broken it actually is in regards to starter &amp; veteran accounts.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because removing more old things from the game gives more immersion?<br />
Instead of solving the issue with the scaling in the first place they just completely remove old materials (like Naxx reagents for example).</div></div><hr />

~100,000,000,000,000,000,000 (100 quintillion, 1e+20) assuming the 30% increase between ranks remains constant</div></div><hr />

<br />
Squish will happen in the 8.0 systems patch/pre patch. Not 7.3.5. Just as the first one happened with the WoD systems patch/pre patch.<br />
<br />
7.3.5 does have a few BFA elements and some stuff thrown in just so they can spend more time working on the 8.0 patch.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nothing to do with immersion, you could already bypass vanilla materials from level 1 Legion.<br />
<br />
It's a quality of life change to only use 1 type of shard/essence/dust for 1-60 zones/dungeons. Even TBC had that almost 11 years ago.<br />
<br />
The old enchants will still be doable with mats and I hope existing stuff gets converted and not into grey junk.<br />
<br />
At level 60+, all dungeons would drop level 60 materials, no way to farm lower stuff. <br />
<br />
Cloth/leather is a mob specific drop so might not change, while Disenchanting is item-specific, with scaling it would be a mess.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And this is a problem how exactly ? Most people just level proffessions with legion mats anyways. No need to have all the other junk, And now its removed a lot of clutter to make the leveling experience better for enchanting while leveling. Which hardly anyone is going to anyways. Cause they gonna do it with legion mats</div></div><hr />

Just tested a character transfer on PTR and you lose all the removed stuff (gone, not turned into grey items). It doesn't change it to the new material.</div></div><hr />

I don't recall him ever having a unique model at any point in Cataclysm. Genn and Gallywix both got their unique models in Legion. This new one replaces his cane-topper with a piece of Azerite, and seems to correct a possible texture/geoset error with his ring.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As suggested by a post on wowhead, that is due to the new scaling ranges. So loot in that level range now has a common disenchanting result.<br />
Something I had not thought about, though simplification of the complete mess that is enchanting materials is very welcome.</div></div><hr />

Instead of solving the issue with the scaling in the first place they just completely remove old materials (like Naxx reagents for example).<br />
<br />
You know this is I think going to be the final nail in the coffin for my gameplay. I have seen things come and go. Been playing since beta back in early 2004. The complete and systematic removal of little things that add immersion to the game has slowly eroded my desire to keep playing it. Professions have always been something I greatly enjoyed. I really hated the streamlined approach they took on several expansions back, but this for enchanting. I don't want it. I understand why they are doing it, but it is the laziest of solutions.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The thing with Artifact Power (AP) is, it is not that hard to farm it once you research your artifact in your class hall to the maximum chapter.<br />
When I learned to do this, it only took me a couple of weeks to max out all 3 of my Death Knight specializations artifacts. In the beginning of a level 110 - ilvl700 - 900 it is a tedious grind without the class hall research but after that, piece of cake. So players should work towards boosting their tier past 900+<br />

Oh yeah I agree they haven't handled AP or AK well at all early on.<br />

But I mean go look at how much it is from 49-50 alone with WoWhead. No way in hell they are gonna cap it at 55 with 50 more levels. If they did then I'd be surprised. Or they intend to give us a burst of AP somehow that doesn't involve AK.</div></div><hr />

<br />
After 7.3.5 hit the PTR, I was bitching on the official forums about how VC and Stocks were dropping lvl 60 reagents from the blues and greens in both instances and how it made leveling enchanting next to impossible. My suggestion was to force those entry level dungeons to drop the low level reagents that always used to drop before regardless if it was run at lvl 15 or lvl 59.<br />
<br />
I am a bit mixed on the current decision. To some extent I am happy to see some of the complexity in the profession gone, as 6 expansions of new reagents have wreaked havoc on bag space, especially If you like to keep old reagents handy for alts. On the other hand, I am sad to see familiar reagents gone forever. I'll play around with these new changes and see how I like them before I make a final decision.<br />
<br />
If you don't like the changes, send the Devs feedback on the PTR forums. Nothing is ever final till the release build.</div></div><hr />

What a drama queen. My main is an enchanter and I would be glad if we could get rid of the multitude of enchantment reagents which exist only in Classic. This is nothing more than waste of storage space. I have no use for nostalgia, either. I probably would be missing the various cloth materials (because you know, we have linen, wool and silk in our real world just as well), but these enchantment materials are quite irrelevant by now. And I am one of the crazy people who tend to ROLEPLAY including crafting materials from all kinds of professions using some outlandish metaphysics about how these things could fit my narrative. I will just retcon my approach fitting to what things are available, and find a suitable explanation. Who knows, maybe the wounding of Azeroth is responsible for such a drastic change?</div></div><hr />

No, not really. They have a point.<br />
<br />
There's literally no 'Immersion' with the change made. They're normalizing the enchanting drops because honestly, Vanilla's was a mess. You're literally telling everyone in this thread that -THIS- is the reason you stop playing retail, which, honestly, is a really, really shallow, kneejerk reaction. You know what's cancer to any game? Saying someone's Cancer for any reason. The 'Immersion' crap has been a go-to for the Classic Extremists for years now, in lieu of quality of life.<br />
<br />
And as someone who played since closed beta, and HAD AN ENCHANTER who had to go to fucking Uldaman for my trainer, i'm all too happy for the change, because they all sucked. You want a single-player RPG experience, go play a single-player RPG, not a constantly evolving MMORPG. <br />

There is a saying &quot;the straw that broke the camels back&quot; It applies here. There has been a steady stream of things in recent expansions that many have expressed a great disdain for.

I see this as a lazy means of streamlining enchanting in classic because of level scaling of item drops. Nothing more. No other explanation has been given yet.<br />
<br />
As for classic being a mess, I liked that mess. It made you interact with the world and think, you know that thing called immersion. Now its grab cloth, click a button, tailoring item made. All the recipes are effectively the same. At least in classic they had some form of making sense. Hey you doing an enchant that dealt with necro dark magic, you needed essence of undeath. I always enjoyed the process of hunting down things and components.<br />
<br />
Now for the Uldaman thing. I thought that it was cool. Because if players wanted enchants they needed to help out the enchanter. I always found it helped bring players together. I gave reasons for players to interact with each other. Hell, the people I met back in classic doing that very thing in Uldaman are still people I play with today in other games now.

I completed my research and yes all 3 of my artifacts to the maximum I could go. Wouldn't let me go any higher. I did my Frost DK<br />
artifact by farming the AP relics from my blood or unholy spec.'s. I reached the maximum research and completed it all in August this year. I stopped playing this character in end of September. If they have nerfed it or jacked it since then, then no I have yet to return to that character. I will soon. If research boosting is banned I will still be able to get the maximum payouts for AP so I am not too worried but if it's too insane now, how can they justify that when there is so much more things to grind and farm in the game?<br />
I found AP to be an easy grind but I was also in winning matches more than 50% pvp BG's &amp; always completing my dungeons and raids and most legion world quests. Completion and good effort is necessary for good AP pay outs, that's for sure.<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
PS: There is also a method to it too... Raids paid out good AP bonuses for your first time doing it every week. So did Brawl events &amp; Legion world quests, not bad. So I did raids on that tuesdays, the reset came up it was raid day. Back to quests, pvp's and dungeons after that. After I maxed out the highest I could go on one of my damage spec.'s, I maxed out my tank spec. next and when I went into raids if the raid tank failed I would take over as secondary tank &amp; later primary tank but I prefered to damage because I had top 3 damage ratio in most non-ToS raids. ToS is tough for anyone farming AP &amp; I wouldn't suggest trying to farm AP from ToS. Not yet anyway. I would switch up my game focus from quest to raid to dungeon to pvp so that i would get bored or sick of farming AP, gold and gear in one aspect of the game.<br />

Ya I played Classic-Vanilla &amp; I actually started the game playing a mage when Burning crusade and took alchemy and herbalism and regretted because I saw how the enchanters were making all the real gold while I had to hope for good luck on the AH with my potions that only educated players knew to use. Back then you could use an invisibility potion in pvp. I liked that and hate the fact they nerfed that from pvp as I do all 3 DK spec.'s now in legion not a stealthy druid or rogue. I want my invisibility trick back. LOL!<br />
I noticed they were advertising on battle.net a classic vintage WoW game set- where you could go an play the original game from 1.0 to 6.0 patches. It was like $70 or some thing. There in lies the real reason Blizzard likes the evolving MMORPG situation for WoW! Yup, it's a conspiracy. LOL!</div></div><hr />

Now for the Uldaman thing. I thought that it was cool. 3. Because if players wanted enchants they needed to help out the enchanter. I always found it helped bring players together. I gave reasons for players to interact with each other. Hell, the people I met back in classic doing that very thing in Uldaman are still people I play with today in other games now. I have even traveled to where they live and we have hung out. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Let's go step by step with this:<br />
<br />
1. That's how real life works. Life moves on, things advance. When we were kids, some of us used to make fun of our elders, their nostalgia and 'the good ol' days', stating that they weren't really that good. You can't go back in time and relive your 'Golden Years'. That applies here too. Certainly, people are entitled to their opinions, but that doesn't mean that those opinions are universally correct. When it comes to MMOs, you either advance and grow or stay stale and stagnate. Most of the QoL changes made were to advance their game as well as retain/gain more resources (subscriptions) than would have been the case otherwise. <br />
<br />
2a. No other expansion has so much 'garbage' when it comes to Tradeskills As soon as you step into Burning Crusade, you have one type across the board and that continues to this day. Given the amount of work that's going to go into streamlining that, as I imagine the spaghetti code to be sometimes very difficult to sift though (since i'm not a Programmer, I won't pretend and say 'OH IT SHOULD BE EASY'). <br />
<br />
2b. They're only streamlining the core materials. They have said nothing about removing the 'elemental' components of any of the old enchantments, so you're speculating/skyisfallism. You'll still need your Essence of Undeath, Righteous Orbs, etc. Not that this requires any 'thought' beyond 'What level of low-level mobs do I need to grind to get this', especially with the elemental drops.<br />
<br />
3. Strawman. This only applied to Guildies, and only the first one or two who were leveling Enchanting at a time. If someone was wanting an Enchant from you outside of your guild, and you didn't have it because you needed to go back to Uldaman, they'd look for someone else to do it rather than waste time. There are exceptions to this rule, but they're just that, exceptions. Nothing is currently stopping you from interacting with other people aside from yourself. <br />
<br />
--------------<br />
<br />
I've been playing since closed beta of WoW and almost 90% of all social interactions and the like people keep clamoring for, are found in guild. Nothing's stopping you from bullshitting with other people in the various chats, too. &quot;MY BARRENS CHAT&quot; isn't immersion and can be found in Tradechat nine times out of ten, for example. If I join a LFR and i'm feeling catty, i'll bullshit and get people involved in my stupidity, which brings the lols and makes it more entertaining for me, but I don't always want to do that. <br />
<br />
Yes, the 'leveling' is easier, especially if you want it to be. In my case, i've done all the earlier content, pre/post-Cataclysm, and don't have any real draw of doing it again, save for being a completionist. So I want to level to max as fast as possible. Why should I suffer through that garbage because the current vocal minority wants to smash their faces into walls?<br />
<br />
You don't want a MMORPG, you want an RPG with an optional chat client. I get most of my 'MMO' experience at end game, where most of the people are and want to be. As do most people.<br />

There was no way, at any point, to 'max' out your Artifact. Mythic hardcore raiders who ground that shit out to stay ahead of the curve, never maxed it out. Currently the 'softcap' is 75 because of the shadowforge or whatever it's called, but you can keep gaining AP for your artifacts. So, i'm calling bullshit on just about your entire post unless you can factually prove otherwise.<br />

Once you hit lvl 54 concordance for each spec you were done before I stopped playing my character. There is a point you can't really go beyond, don't care if you believe me or not. This was until they introduced the new traits but, I quit my character since then and only do vanilla for now. You might as well flipping bank artifact power for the next patch 7.3. No one will max out concordance in their lifetime as it is, it's 865 trillion to lvl 50. I did max that, I meant the point you can't go beyond a few have hit lvl 72. Sure ok it's limitless because Blizz makes it limitless in concordance but that's just fools leveling from there since a new season patch is coming to render this all useless. I sold my AP, why bother after lvl 50 conc. at that time. If the AP gains in 7.3 go to a billion+ a piece then it might be worth it to put BFA-7.3 AP relics into your legion artifact once your BFA artifact is maxed out to concordance lvl 50 - to current 75... if you still play legion, if it at all works the same and they allow that, hope they do. No one wants to have done that artifact grind for nothing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So, from what I gather from all your posts is...<br />
<br />
That you don't have a damn clue about what you're talking about.<br />
<br />
Let's start with this statement: <br />
<br />
don't care if you believe me or not<br />
You've already set it up that all the crap you're saying doesn't matter, you don't want to actually have discourse, but just want to troll with your ramblings. <br />
<br />
Then, earlier I quoted you as saying 'I played in Vanilla, but started playing in BC'. It's either one or the other. You started playing in Vanilla or you started playing in Burning Crusade.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I sold my AP<br />
No you didn't. Aside from a rare few AP tokens that you got from quests, which at that point in you timeline, you'd have used to get to the point where you 'maxed out', you can't sell AP tokens.<br />
<br />
And what in the world do you mean by 'BFA Artifact'? Artifacts are getting removed once BFA goes live, as we remove/destroy/purify Sargeras' sword stuck in Silithus. We've known since before Legion went live that the artifacts aren't staying beyond the expansion, but if you think the grind is 'for nothing', what in the world do you plan on doing in Classic? Once you're done with Molten Core and Blackwing Lair, the farming of Fire Resist and Onyxia scales are for nothing (etc, etc, etc). <br />
<br />
The gaining of Artifact power is part of the gameplay. Supplemental. You gain AP from doing stuff you should be doing normally and most people (I.E. Non Mythic Raiders) wouldn't/shouldn't be grinding them out unless that's specifically what they enjoy doing (Like I do). Seems like you're the sort of person that likes to spite themselves and that's really about it. You 'sold' your AP tokens because you deemed them useless, when you could have used them and gotten a nice little power boost when your artifact leveled.<br />

i meant the future in which i would play some bgs as level 20 on frozen account (basically copy past starter edition) and up on re subbing it would auto add all the exp from bgs to that character. the exp i don't want at all. there has been situations where few 100% starter account just auto upgraded by itself due to bug. this feature is cancer if it is forced and the experience eliminated function bugs are not addressed.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ComputerNerd</div><div class="date">2017-12-16, 02:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There is a saying &quot;the straw that broke the camels back&quot; It applies here. There has been a steady stream of things in recent expansions that many have expressed a great disdain for. I understand that the world grows and welcome it. Going back and wiping out the past for the sake of what? I see this as a lazy means of streamlining enchanting in classic because of level scaling of item drops. Nothing more. No other explanation has been given yet.<br />
<br />
As for classic being a mess, I liked that mess. It made you interact with the world and think, you know that thing called immersion. Now its grab cloth, click a button, tailoring item made. All the recipes are effectively the same. At least in classic they had some form of making sense. Hey you doing an enchant that dealt with necro dark magic, you needed essence of undeath. I always enjoyed the process of hunting down things and components.<br />
<br />
Now for the Uldaman thing. I thought that it was cool. Because if players wanted enchants they needed to help out the enchanter. I always found it helped bring players together. I gave reasons for players to interact with each other. Hell, the people I met back in classic doing that very thing in Uldaman are still people I play with today in other games now. I have even traveled to where they live and we have hung out. <br />
<br />
People who offer no insight and just post tripe such as:<br />
<br />
are a cancer to any community. <br />
<br />
But I guess haters gonna hate here. You have your opinion, and I have mine. As I stated, I rather enjoyed it.<br />
<br />
The reason for the streamlining of the materials is down to the scaling, as you said.<br />
Before there were effectively regional dusts, shards and essences as the loots/drops were within a certain level range.<br />
Now with this level scaling, the loot from say deadmines can be anything from lvl 20 to lvl 60.<br />
So the materials would go from being gathered in the right level range of zones, to being gathered by one of the right level range.<br />
<br />
If you want to call it lazy, then explain how you would approach that differently.<br />
How would you have it so a player can equally gather the materials they require from disenchanting when they can no longer target it geographically.<br />
<br />
Interaction from a need to achieve something is very different from being social.<br />
Being social is interaction without agenda, without a &quot;need&quot;.<br />
I go help someone in a dungeon because they benefit.<br />
Not because I need to reach a vendor or trainer.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wow, seems like you like to be a personally obtuse grumpy person. It seems you think I am trying to declare myself some self-proclaimed expert on WoW. I started here mentioning that I have not played legion live for a few months, since Sept. &amp; my only point was before they patched and jacked it while I was gone I found the AP grind to be relatively easy and I maxed it out to the point I couldn't go beyond but with the jacked leveling since I've been gone, there are others beyond me now sure. I have done classic several times, just finished a druid in classic days ago. Am doing a hunter on PTR right now.<br />
<br />
<br />
Then, earlier I quoted you as saying 'I played in Vanilla, but started playing in BC'. It's either one or the other. You started playing in Vanilla or you started playing in Burning Crusade.<br />
<br />
Yes I did both. Yes I am aware Vanilla came before Burning Crusade. Before WoW officialy came out I was a competition level 30+ RTS (Real Time Strategy) Warcraft: Frozen Throne player with a 55% win ratio and over a 1000 battles. I did most of it in network centre in public and was asked by a network centre owner to try Vanilla in beta for free. At first I didn't like it. So I did not start playing live until BC. I started liking WoW when BC came out so that's why that happened. Originally I hated WoW at first because it killed my RTS game... been a regular PC gamer geek for 20 years now. I couldn't get much battles anymore, in RTS because of WoW. Then I got into WoW and later started liking it BC and beyond.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;No you didn't.&quot;<br />
<br />
Yes I did! I flipping made thousands of G on AP items because I just didn't see the need for them anymore since I figured the next patch might kill the artifacts and everything we did in the legion game.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;And what in the world do you mean by 'BFA Artifact'?&quot;<br />
<br />
I don't really know what I meant by that because there are 2 standing theories of what BFA will grant. No artifact and new heritage armor &amp; battle gear and possibly a leveling structure for that and new races and good bye artifact - or a new artifact &amp; a new artifact leveling structure or the ability to heirloom your artifact. I am hearing mixed messages. Many are complaining to blizz that they don't want their artifact to become irrelevant next patch. So is WoW really going to make artifacts/heirlooms irrelevant in BFA 7.3 patch...?? I doubt it. What is it 8 months before it comes out? They are still testing if the level scaling thing is going to be acceptable or not. I know I'm going through PTR... just did a race change on PTR. I don't even wanna look at what lvl 100 - 110+ is gonna look like. It's gonna be ugly.<br />
<br />
<br />
what in the world do you plan on doing in Classic?<br />
<br />
PTR... going back to the roots of the game. Seems what WoW is doing with New races, which are not really new races. That's why I wasn't around to reply for a while. Got sick of paying to much to grind out a massive toon just so I could play competitive without getting stomped like all the freshies.<br />
<br />
<br />
The gaining of Artifact power is part of the gameplay. Supplemental. You gain AP from doing stuff you should be doing normally and most people (I.E. Non Mythic Raiders) wouldn't/shouldn't be grinding them out unless that's specifically what they enjoy doing (Like I do).<br />
<br />
That's really the only point I was trying to make except that you can grind them out non-mythic. For players not in the higher tiers trying to grind them out in mythic would be a bad idea. I grinded all mine out in normal and heroic, easily before I went to mythics with my guild. Otherwise I agree with that.<br />
<br />
<br />
You 'sold' your AP tokens because you deemed them useless, when you could have used them and gotten a nice little power boost when your artifact leveled.<br />
<br />
You shouldn't assume what other people you don't know are doing and why? No I sold them when I hit maximum at the time on my blood and unholy artifacts and because I knew at some point I wanted to stop leveling in legion and wait until the next patch comes out. Would rather have the gold for whatever. If they are going to destroy the artifact efforts by making them irrelevant in the next patch... why bother going beyond what I did already.</div></div><hr />
