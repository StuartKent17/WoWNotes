That pretty much means epic failure when it comes down to box office. A good decision imo. Id prefer it not to be moved at all, but when put up against a movie like star wars, I would much rather it be delayed and be able to show its true colors so they are more likely to make a second movie. If it went against star wars and made crappy profits that pretty much gives an second movie &quot;a quick drop with a sudden stop&quot; if you get my meaning.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is actually a good point. Warcraft doesn't really have a strong enough license outside of the games to compete with Star Wars and The Hobbit. Funny how it's the complete opposite when it comes to the games, well at least the MMO's.</div></div><hr />

You do realize that this is a -Warcraft- movie right? Not -World of Warcraft-, doesn't matter if WoW will be relevant or not, because this is an origin story, it has to do with the original RTS games a lot more than WoW.</div></div><hr />

Yes, and because Blizzard has cancelled things before, this means everything Blizzard ever will work on thus shall be cancelled as well, forever. No more expansions, nada. And we all fell for it. Because we're bad people.</div></div><hr />

Also this.. I just feel its a very smart move on there park.. Give it a release window to at least give it a week or 2 to shine. Not to be over crowded, but also isn't Avatar 2 also line up for Dec 2015 release.<br />

<br />
yeah except you are ignoring the main reason that trope exists. <br />
<br />
the vast majority of &quot;video game movies&quot; arent actually video game movies, they are either loosely based sharing almost nothing to do with the game besides things you can find on the covers and the title or they are based around &quot;ER MEH GERD IM IN TEH GAIME!&quot; <br />
<br />
video game movies suck because they are made by people who dont care and dont understand video games, they are made by old dumb people. <br />
<br />
the warcraft movie is being made, written, produced and cast by people who play and love warcraft<br />
<br />
these arent people who looked at the picture on the case of world of warcraft saw an elf and a dwarf and said &quot;hmm the name warcraft inspires me&quot; <br />
<br />
this isnt &quot;inspired by&quot; this isnt &quot;loosely based on&quot; this is a movie recreation of the events of warcraft 1</div></div><hr />

the warcraft movie is being made, written, produced and cast by people who play and love warcraft<br />
<br />
these arent people who looked at the picture on the case of world of warcraft saw an elf and a dwarf and said &quot;hmm the name warcraft inspires me&quot; <br />
<br />
this isnt &quot;inspired by&quot; this isnt &quot;loosely based on&quot; this is a movie recreation of the events of warcraft 1<br />
<br />
That's not strictly true</div></div><hr />

it pretty much is, the page even says so itself. <br />

it even points out that video game movies are just like comic book movies, comic book movies used to suck because they werent made by people who understood them or cared about them. <br />

now comic book movies are made by people who do and we have a whole universe of marvel movies</div></div><hr />

Star Wars is casting right now, same as Warcraft. So, there is no hidden agenda behind the move besides not wanting to go against a massive blockbuster.<br />

And some comic book movies completely flop, even if they are in well known universes. Having a person that isnt old isnt what you need for a good movie, nor was it an actual contributing factor to a movie's success. <br />

Anyways, I have low expectations for this movie, and will be pleasantly surprised if it ends up with a metacritic or rottentomatoes score above 60</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think that's the key. To have low expectations. I'm not being facetious.<br />
<br />
I have very low expectations about movies, games, everything. I don't get sucked into the hype. I wait until I see a movie or hear and album or play a game for myself before making up my mind. This way I am almost always pleasantly surprised in one way or another. It means the real duds really stand out, too.<br />
<br />
I have exceedingly low expectations for the Warcraft movie. If it gets released, isn't universally loathed by critics and fans alike, and actually makes Blizzard some kind of cash, I'll regard it as successful.<br />
<br />
<br />
Why do people always ask if WoW will be relevant by then? The Warcraft franchise has been around for nearly 20 years. Warcraft didn't begin with WoW, and it won't end with it, either.</div></div><hr />

Perhaps not, but its not a 'WoW movie', its a Warcraft movie.<br />
<br />
Some people may not be able to tell the difference, but if we're talking accurately then this movie is based loosely on the events of a 20 year old game. So 'relevance' is a pretty moot point.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Warcraft movie does not equal Pixar movie. It is far more detailed, and photo realistic. I think they have even mentioned that they want to use Avatar level motion capture, and rival or outshine LotR movies. Pixar, by the way, does maybe 2 movies at best a year, and when they started, it was barely one every two years. Star Wars has historically taken three years between each movie, and that is with Lucas knowing in his head the basic outline and how he wants it to look for years. I am not at all surprised that they want to take two years to make this movie. Also, The Hobbit movie became two movies, then three movies, and each new movie still is taking a year to put out, even with having a lot of the action already shot, and just waiting on the CGI.</div></div><hr />

Quality over Quantity, Pixar themselves have proven that. All there best movies were made when they didn't make 2 movies a year.</div></div><hr />

And this is worst thing for me - it would be so much better if Blizzard would make their own movie in full GCI! But instead we will probably get another Hobbit (movie which is only good when you do not read book - so in case of WoW it will be good movie if you did not play games and read books).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because that's how the movie business works... Winter &amp; Summer = Biggest income. I don't expect a March 2016 release, especially considering the movie isn't even in full production<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kojinshugi</div><div class="date">2013-11-28, 03:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Some may suggest it was because of the Star Wars movie, but the movie was slated to be released in pretty much one year and they haven't even chosen the cast yet. So there was no way it was going to be even close to ready for that release date.<br />
<br />
The math is not strong in this one.<br />
<br />
It was slated to be released in two years, 2015. They've pushed it back 4 months, so as not to compete with Star Wars.<br />
<br />
By the way, the reason these big movies announce release dates years in advance is exactly so they can plan production accordingly. These high budget features are a huge investment and it'd be idiotic to lose a ton of potential revenue because you picked the wrong month to come out.<br />
<br />
They now know when Star Wars will be out, they decided (wisely) not to compete with it, and will now get an extra 4 months of production time. Which is a good thing. It's cheaper to have a smaller post-production team work longer than getting a bigger post-production team to do it quickly.</div></div><hr />

Been waiting a long time for this. Seems to be keep postponing. I really hope it'd be a success. But, now... I'm just not sure. Will the release just be shadowed?<br />

Also congratulations to the winners of the amazing fey dragon mount &amp; the adorable alterac brew-pup!</div></div><hr />

This is a big fail on the part of the studio. If December wasn't going to work, they should have moved it to May or June to catch the early Summer rush.</div></div><hr />

That was my thought too, except that they haven't even started making the thing yet. If the movie was complete and then they pushed it to the March dumping period I'd say it's doomed for sure, but I think in this case there's still room for hope. A fair number of &quot;testing the waters&quot; movies have started coming out in March; if this movie is decent and gets decent audiences, I'm sure they'll make sequels that more directly compete w/ the summer or Christmas blockbusters. Which I think speaks to the reason for this change: no one quite knows if this will be received as &quot;a silly CGI film from that dorky Warcraft game&quot; or the next Lord of the Rings smash hit, and an unknown like that is just too much of a gamble to put up against one of the most anticipated movies of the decade.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The time to strike when the iron was hot passed back in 2007-2010 when WotLK's peak would have had the player and movie goer base by the balls, let alone now when the iron is barely luke warm.<br />
<br />
Duncan Jones is an amazing and talented film maker, i really do hope he has the foresight to see that hes been given a bit of a lemon.<br />
<br />
I still to this day think a live action Warcraft film is a mistake. the general public will see it as a B grade LotR rip off, and disgruntled ex players probably will have no interest seeing it in two years time.<br />
<br />
Smart thing for me would have been a full length action CGI film with excellent voice actors, and the quality we know Blizzard is capable of (WoW cinematics, HotS cinematic etc)</div></div><hr />

It'll be fine. They pushed it back most likely due to the fact a new starwars movie comes out in December. Not wise to fight against that.</div></div><hr />

As excited i am to see this film, I'm glad they're not competing with star wars. I want to pay and support both movies, but if they both came out at the same time it be too tempted to pay for one and sneak into the other =P</div></div><hr />

And I believe the 3rd part of the Hobbit(if all goes to plan) will come out then as well.</div></div><hr />

Not really a miracle. It'll still be relevant. Now granted they'll most likely be other mmo's out.</div></div><hr />
