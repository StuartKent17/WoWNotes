Legion - Moose Mount<br />
For players that don't get the Grove Warden (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/189999-grove-warden), there is still hope for a moose mount. Legion adds a new moose mount model, but there is no spell, item, or source yet, so we can't be sure if you will be able to obtain this mount. <br />

Blue Tweets<br />
Can you guys please add Winter's Grasp and Flames to the Stolen Present? One chance a year is nuts!<br />
No that is not rare. A'lar is rare. Rivendare's mount is rare. One chance in a lifetime simply sucks.<br />
It's do-able yearly, per character, not a one-time quest. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/678874917547327493))<br />

Too late for that. The way the thing runs on the ground makes me think more of a rabbit hopping along than a moose running. It's almost like the art department only looked at still images and decided to wing it for the rest.</div></div><hr />

i'll probably not specifically grind for one of those, but it's cool as an option i guess. i love moose irl, but i'm not particularly excited about more moose mounts. not even interested in the magical one in the game now.</div></div><hr />

If you're not playing any of them, don't vote. You're no longer a person who plays Blizzard game. Move on.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There's a difference between knowing the % of players that used to (they are now regulars on MMO-Champion, so safe bet to assume that they once played a Blizzard Game) play these games and stopped, or at least are stopped for the moment being (and how this number relates to people still playing them) and assuming 100% of MMO-Champion still, and will continue, to play Blizzard Games, simply due to that lack of voting option.<br />
<br />
I'm sure you believe we all should be caressing Activision-Blizzard buttcheeks; But data is only useful when it can be properly interpreted. <br />

On topic: While I like what they are doing with &quot;Flashy Mount goes into raiding and eventually Store - while plebs get to purchase a not-flashy version of the mount&quot;; I just hope we won't see 20 recolored Moose Mounts around in game, along with just another 2 or 3 other models the ENTIRE expansion pack.</div></div><hr />

Yes, Mongoose Bite was the spell. But no it's not a placeholder it's just plain coming back as a melee attack, instead of a spell that you used when you had no choice because deadzone was a thing then..</div></div><hr />

be glad you still have a group to raid with, for the past month i've been trying to find a new raid group since 90% of mine quit, no one's recruiting for heroic HFC anymore, and i'm sitting on 723 ilevel DK with curve and all in what is probably one of the most populated alliance servers, silvermoon. (and no, i have no desire to go mythic, i want friendly run, not horrid military style 2nd job)</div></div><hr />

Not everyone is capable of being a leader. To lead a pick up group of people through a H HFC raid to a successful Archimonde kill is way more difficult than most would believe. There are constant issues, people whining about stuff, having to make sure people are pulling their weight, still explaining basic strategies and more often not to the more geared people in the group. Always someone just standing in fire still (ilvl 728 Rogue with stack of 9 Doomfire and still standing in it).<br />
<br />
There are so many other annoyances and time consuming tasks that it simply becomes not worth it. I can understand why there are so few groups and really it is a failure on Blizzards part as well as a failure on the Warcraft Communities part on why this is happening.</div></div><hr />

Then he should join a guild, that's what they're for. People want high requirements for pugs because of stuff you listed. I've led many pugs, I also have high standards because I don't want good players leaving because I let in bad ones. My time is valuable I don't want to waste it. Someone complaining about not being invited has the option of joining a guild or starting their own pug and listing whatever requirements they want. I'd love to see how far they get letting in anyone.</div></div><hr />

I thought D3 was high too, but I thought about it some more. The active playerbase for D3 might not be anywhere the size of Hearthstone, but D3 will see a strong showing on this website at least. Lot of my WoW friends list still goes back for the new seasons so there's plenty of crossover. Annual Pass did a lot of good there imo</div></div><hr />

Someone can't find a heroic pug. :p<br />
<br />
<br />
I cant even get a pug for the HC archi kill thanks to the elitist cunts that play the game and demand ilevel 900 or ask for 500k up front, the days of friendly players helping each other out are long gone.<br />

People have been paying for mount runs since BC. Get good or pony up. We don't owe you anything.</div></div><hr />

Bullshit. Having good gear doesn't count towards being good or bad in the game where you can be easily carried. At least give him a chance. In my RL carrier I've recruited plenty of people with crap gear who could outdps or outheal or outtank similar kind of duche like you, m8.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Guilds are there to give people a chance. Pugs are not. <br />
<br />
With garrisons shitting out gold there is no excuse to not come up with 40k and just buy a carry. Hell the token gives you 35k, pretend it's a store mount.</div></div><hr />

People want high requirements for pugs because of stuff you listed. I've led many pugs, I also have high standards because I don't want good players leaving because I let in bad ones. My time is valuable I don't want to waste it. Someone complaining about not being invited has the option of joining a guild or starting their own pug and listing whatever requirements they want. I'd love to see how far they get letting in anyone.<br />
<br />
See you are whats bad about this game, claiming your precious time will be wasted because your ego is soooooo big you wont let any of us &quot;scrubs&quot; in.<br />
<br />
And if you bothered to read my post you will see i have been leading groups and making groups ever since the Moose mount was announced, but thanks to people like you who leave after one wipe or ask for ilvl 800 and have an achievement you cant even get unless your a HC raider then ppl like me WITH REAL TIME ISSUES like kids and families and jobs, not your pathetic &quot;Can we hurry up plz i need to go have a wank over some Hentai soon&quot;<br />
<br />
So dont come at me with that bullshit you fucktard i wish players like you would die in a fire. You are the biggest waste of oxygen to this planet!<br />

STFU you nerd, i will not be forced into paying a bunch of virgins like you who think they are gods just to take me through one fucking boss. You type of players make me sick to my stomach, picking on the weaker players thinking your a god, you want to get a life son and go out into the real world.<br />

You sound mad. I bet you're on welfare. You enjoy getting rewards while putting in no effort. You want everyone else to carry you through life. Based on the little temper tantrum you just threw it's no surprise guilds don't want you and pugs are declining you. It's a video game, grow up.<br />

And yet again you show what a lowlife you really are, what has welfare got to do with anything (not on it btw....) For one i own my own guild and decided long ago not to join others for personal reasons and 2 pugs dont decline me,they leave after one wipe or bitch n moan if you dont do over 80k dps on first try. So yeah why don't you try growing up a little instead of thinking your some gaming god because your guild carries you through mythic raids.... you scream virgin mate i feel sorry for you in a way.<br />
