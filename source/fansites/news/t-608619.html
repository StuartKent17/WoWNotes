Ok, that's official.<br />
US Starting date: June 24<br />
EU Starting date: June 25<br />
<br />
We’re currently planning to end the third Arena season and begin Arena Season 4 on June 24, 2008. This exciting Arena season will introduce the Brutal Gladiator set, and will also allow players to purchase Arena Season 2 items using the honor system. Please note that we will be resetting all Arena team and personal ratings. Players will still retain their Arena points and teams with this reset. The team and personal rating will simply be reset to the default 1500, allowing all teams to once again compete for top honors with a fresh start.<br />
<br />
Also, with the end of the third season, players on the top teams from each battlegroup will receive their end-of-season rewards. These include Arena-specific titles that they can display proudly until the end of the new season, and, for the best of the best, an Armored Nether Drake. Please also be aware that with the end of the current season, all previous end-of-season titles will be removed.<br />

<br />
Rating requirements<br />
While Season 3 is still going strong, we wanted to announce ahead of time the rating requirements that will be present for arena items once Season 4 begins. We also wanted to give everyone a heads up to some changes that will be in an upcoming patch, altering how points are gained and players are matched in the arena system. The patch with these changes is scheduled to release before the start of Season 4.<br />
<br />
First though, the rating requirement changes:<br />
<br />
When Season 4 begins, Season 3 items will be reduced in personal and team arena rating requirement to:<br />
Shoulders: 1950<br />
Weapon: 1800<br />
<br />
The new Season 4 items will have the below personal and team arena rating requirements:<br />
Shoulders: 2200<br />
Weapon: 2050<br />
Head: 1700<br />
Chest: 1600<br />
Legs: 1550<br />
Gloves: none<br />
Off-hand: none<br />
<br />
In addition, some of the Season 4 quality items that will be purchasable with honor will also carry a personal and team arena rating requirement:<br />
Boots: 1700<br />
Ring: 1650<br />
Bracers: 1575<br />
Belt: none<br />
Necklace: none<br />
Trinket: none<br />
<br />
The Season 2 items, which will move to the honor system when Season 4 begins, will continue to have no rating requirement.<br />
<br />
The changes to the rating requirements for these items reflect the nature of the items, their power, and the relative difficulty that should be had when attempting to obtain them. These items are comparable to those found in the newest 25 person raid zone, Sunwell Plateau, and should therefore also feel very challenging to obtain.<br />
<br />
To help ensure that the challenge in obtaining these items stays true to those achieving these ratings, we'll also be implementing new rules with an upcoming patch to curb practices that undermine the core concepts of the arena system. These rules are as follows:<br />
If a character’s personal rating is more than 150 points below the team rating, they will earn points based on their personal rating instead of the team rating.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This means that a player cannot join a highly rated team and begin earning points based purely on the pre-established rating of the team before they joined it. They'll need to compete, improve, and gain a personal rating worthy of the points they would receive.<br />
If the average personal rating of the players queuing for a game is more than 150 points below the team’s rating, the team will be queued against an opponent matching or similar to the average personal rating.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This means that players cannot join a highly rated team and immediately face highly rated opponents, easily and quickly bringing their personal rating up. Instead they'll need to again compete, improve, and earn their rating.<br />
<br />
We're excited to see these changes implemented, which will continue to emphasize the strong competitive nature of the arenas, and the challenge in obtaining the highest end rewards available for PvP. <br />

I'm really at a loss with regards to the S4 1H hunter axes. They are inferior to the S3 2H hunter axe.<br />

The only real benefit is enchants-wise. I know some hunters get +int enchants on both 1H'ers for arena.</div></div><hr />

Yes.... to both questions. Veterans drops out and is replaced by Vindicators.... which is replaced in turn by Guardians. Everything basically just shifts down one peg. S1 disappears from sight.</div></div><hr />

Well u cant do shit with Kiljaeden loot except...kill jaeden (lol) again and again and again. There is nothing after him to gear up for. You cant do shit in PvP with PvE gear, atleast as a tanking warrior and some other classes. In Wotlk, greens and blues will be on equal grounds regarding stats and I wouldnt be surprised if s4 gear would even be better for leveling to 80, because of dmg+hp+defense (this is an asumption). So statwise they bring u nowhere and you dont even look like you have accomplished something, in my oppinion, amazing. That kind of drains my motivation quite a bit and I know I'm not the only one thinking this way.</div></div><hr />

this still holds, but cannot be carried quite that high. likewise, you simply can't be 1850 players to get 2200, you would need to be more like 2000-2100 players. the reason being if you lose a game while Q'ing at 1850, its 25+ points. i rerolled my 2s team for glad (past druid quit for AoC :() and around 1650 rating we took 29 points from some team, meaning they would have to beat us 25x or more after just to regain those points. <br />
<br />
while your assumptions are correct, and i believe i pointed them out on mmo-champion first, you need to be NEAR perfect to actually pull it off, however that is something blizzard should not rely on. again abolish team rating as i have said plenty of times, but w/e. <br />
<br />
it will take legit teams 2-3 weeks to gain shoulders, hopefully the full reset will keep more teams in line, as it has already slowed boosting significantly.</div></div><hr />

This doesn't work, really. If you ever lose, you'll spiral down in rating really quick, 30 per loss. It's just not worth the risk, way easier to do it legit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
With the exception of the gloves, you'll notice all the stuff that doesn't require rating can't be enchanted. <br />
<br />
And the reason gloves don't require rating is because of the equip: so if they change it from the last season at the last minute, people won't get screwed over, so everyone who can buy the gloves for this season is on a level footing.</div></div><hr />

Again, they have already explained this. When WotLK comes out, PvE and PvP armor sets will be different (ie. not just recolored skins) The reason they aren't doing this now is because they are working on WotLK. Since the expansion is coming out soon, you won't be using this gear for long anyway. I would rather see better content in WotLK than wasting time on this expansion.</div></div><hr />

For as far as I know, yes, they will. And S2 will replace it for honor...<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
If I'm right they still give you S1 gear. Since S1 is comparable with T4 just like:<br />
T5=S2, T6=S3.. Correct me if I'm wrong..<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I am just getting into PvP so I have to start somewhere.. I hope they dont knock out S1 pvp Gear.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Like said, as far as I know they will be removed from the game. Would be an idea to make them replace the ''blue vendor crap'' pvp items tho.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Geboran</div><div class="date">2008-06-11, 06:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The blue vendor &quot;crap&quot; is where you start.<br />
<br />
I doubt that Blizz will replace it with S1, but it's possible, I suppose.<br />

Season 1 gear will not be purchasable for honor when Season 4 starts. It is &quot;superceded&quot; with the Season 2 upgrade for the same honor/token costs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The OP asked where he gets to start.<br />
<br />
1. Blue rep &quot;PvP&quot; set<br />
2. Battleground &quot;grind&quot; for Season 2 set / Season 4 &quot;non-rating&quot; pieces.<br />
3. Arena groups once you have 300+ resilience. (most classes)</div></div><hr />

I also waited 1-2 months of not purchasing anything (because i thought S4 was coming out much sooner then it did) to pretty much spend 60k honor and 3.5k arena points a week ago (not knowing when S4 was coming out, but thinking that i still had plenty of time before it did) now wishing they would have announced it a week earlier, but... all in all Im glad that its finally out.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Newor</div><div class="date">2008-06-11, 10:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">From what I read in one of the older news. Probably nothing would change except for S2 going for Honor System and S3 getting lower prices and Weapon/Shoulder ratings 'cause since S4 &quot;BG Gear&quot; will be the 1st one with arena rating requiriment, we would still have Vindicator stuff in the Honor System as a &quot;arena rating free&quot; options.<br />
<br />
So we would still exchange badges for veteran stuff.<br />
<br />
And, of course, no changes with &quot;Tier Token for Season X&quot;, 'cause they stated that each season would cost the token for the Tier they &quot;match&quot; from blizzard view point.</div></div><hr />

So my question is will Guardian's Pendant of Subjugation (and its counterpart I guess the Guardian's Band of Subjugation) be available at the start of Season 4? Or will they be like the Vindicator version and be made available in a future update?</div></div><hr />

There is nothing after him to gear up for. You cant do shit in PvP with PvE gear, atleast as a tanking warrior and some other classes. In Wotlk, greens and blues will be on equal grounds regarding stats and I wouldnt be surprised if s4 gear would even be better for leveling to 80, because of dmg+hp+defense (this is an asumption). So statwise they bring u nowhere and you dont even look like you have accomplished something, in my oppinion, amazing. That kind of drains my motivation quite a bit and I know I'm not the only one thinking this way. <br />
<br />
<br />
TBH I dont think you'll see many people in T6/SW gear replacing it any time before lvl 80 raids.<br />
<br />
I hit 70 on my hunter, and while it only had T2, I was still wearing 5 pieces of it when I hit 70 and started raiding.<br />
<br />
I know a lot of guys who were doing Kara and Arena in T3.<br />
<br />
So yeah, don't be sure sure that greens and blues will out lvl your current endgame gear (pssst - it wont)</div></div><hr />

I mean, I spent like 2.5k gold on my Lionheart Champion like 2months ago and now this weapon is more than useless and so easy to overcome by anyone out there who has time to play BG.<br />
<br />
Since PvE and PvP gear is improving, why dont blizzard adjust so that Blacksmiths would be able to craft equal/better weapons/armors?<br />

what makes you want to become a Blacksmith today? NONE.</div></div><hr />

Was checking out the new gear that comes in s4 on this site and i see the 2h sword has no rating on it...this must be a bug or wot?(showing it as it was on ptr). or else a 140 dps 2h with no rating hmmmm that sounds fun</div></div><hr />

Likely the cost of what Season 2 costs currently.<br />

I don't know *for certain*, however, but, logically, it makes sense.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not sure if thats been mentioned already, but whats up with S3-like honorstuff? As far as I see from the pricing screenshot, the vindicators boots are purchasable at a lower price than before. While that is very nice, I wonder what's about the belt? In the afore mentioned screenshot there are only the new S4-like belts, but no vindicators belts. Are those nifty belts to be thrown out of the game? I'd like to complete my S3-Set optically with the vindicators boots &amp; belts. Do I need to rampage on battlegrounds till tuesday/wednesday to take the chance to buy them before they're gone?<br />

The reason why the S3 bracers and boots are still available in S4 is that the S4 equivalents have rating requirements on them, while the belt does not, so it would be just as easy to the new belt as it would to get the old one.</div></div><hr />
