Jump to conclusions much? They've already said all your honor / prestige will be amalgamated together on your account. <br />

That wont make a difference. Your prestige levels are just fancier ways of saying honor. Take out the title of &quot;prestige 1, 2, 3, etc&quot; and all you have are honor levels. Which is what they've decided to do. Its still gunna be cross-char and combined together. Char Copy just became available I expect many bugs. This kind of stuff happens with mounts / pets too on previous betas. 400 mounts on live then for some reason 180 on beta. <br />
<br />
Just give them time</div></div><hr />

Pretty much this, although I'll have both of them before flying is unlocked so... it's just a solid 'meh' from me.<br />
<br />
Here's to two more mounts that I won't ever use to contribute to totals for future locked mounts that I also probably won't use.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yea, this is a let down.<br />
<br />
Reward mounts for hitting high marks like 400 should be mounts that make you say, &quot;HOLY FUCK THAT IS AWESOME HOW DO I GET THAT MOUNT&quot;. Unfortunately, I look at that mount ... shrug ... and say, who cares. Given how much work goes into collecting 400 mounts, I'm amazed Blizz doesn't give a shit about the reward. <br />
<br />
They hit a home run with the very first reward mount at 50 since the albino drake grabbed your attention at the time. Since then, it's kinda gone downhill.</div></div><hr />

It looks sooooo stupid when you're on a hill and your mount is standing at a 45 degree angle.... Like I honestly don't even understand how it's a thing when other horse models are always standing upright. <br />
<br />
And yeah I dunno why they're struggling so hard to find a decent 400 mount reward, there are plenty of interesting mount models unused in the game files. But the 2 options so far have been rather blah. I mean I like them, but I feel like after earning 400 mounts you should get something pretty epic.<br />

TBF I imagine if you already have 400 mounts collected it's going to be hard for them to come up with something better than what you already have to choose from.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When looking at the kul'tiran bird form head on, in a model viewer, the left talon is not connected to the rest of the leg's rig. The talon jets out wildly to the left during it's animation sequence. If you turn the model or camera around to view the talon from different angels, you can see where (it almost looks like an accident or oversight) the left talon is not as connected to the rest of the leg as the right talon is with the right leg. This models appears to be sharing a similar rig with other alike birds in the game, and they too have this un-pivoting, structure. It's almost like it seems that all that really needs to be done is to go into the rigging/skeleton and connect the left talon to the left leg correctly, to let it match the seamless animation of the right leg. In it's current form, to me, it appears as if it's left talon or leg is injured as it juts out wildly with each flap of it's wings. This is the same for the owls, buzzards, parrots, condors and basically most birds in the game that share this rig / skeleton. <br />
<br />
I have left feedback on this in the past on the wow forums but it seems they use the same skeleton for these birds while the glitchy-looking kinking of the left talon persists. I suppose to continue, you can see where the issue (as I view it as an issue) is not fixed on even the new parrot mounts coming out. Example, the parrots that have hooks, well the hooks rotate in the same direction of the unattached talon. I just point out visuals when I see them, but they go unnoticed or unanswered / unremedied most of the time. Just want the game to look good! Maybe if anyone else notices or agrees, they can offer insight, input or opinion on the matter. Thanks for reading all, peace!</div></div><hr />

<br />
But that's not the point. We just want new stuff, you don't see people complaining about the 350 mount reward do you? That's because the infernal model a recent one(Legion). Now for the 400, why not do the same and make it use a BFA model? Why the hell a cata model? And a cheap one where they just changed its color, no new accessories or literally anything to make it more appealing. Talk about being extremely lazy.</div></div><hr />

But they need the cool Looking unique Models for $$$ in the ingame Shop...why should they give them away for free? SURE, you had to sink in much time and effort, but they allready made your subscription $$$ so why they should now waste good models if they can just give us lazy recolors ?<br />
<br />
Shoutout to all the people that claimed „Ingame-Shop is totally optional and only astetical and won’t effect the game in any way“ the time it aired.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There definitely are class changes, just no one is documenting them. The Disc Priest talent Lenience was nerfed to 3% for instance.</div></div><hr />

And, to my surprise, they actually changed it, too bad this is one is also underwhelming for this achievement. Not that it's a bad model, but another one as a reward for 400 mount, sigh. Why not use at least a new model from BFA god damnit, stop being lazy.<br />
<br />
It felt like a April's fools. Gawd.<br />
<br />
I will never get 400 mounts, but I laughed inside when I saw this after reading the complaints about the previous reward. I was pretty much feeling how fed up Blizzard must have been, and then just adding this just to shake some reality into players.</div></div><hr />

There are plenty of decent looking non store mounts. Just to list a few... Smoldering Ember Wyrm, Ashes of Alar, Celestial Cloud Serpent, Firehawks, quite a lot of the order hall mounts such as the Wolfhawk or Elemental, Hearthsteed and more.<br />
<br />
Also quite a few store mounts use existing texture or skeleton structures.<br />
<br />
Celestial Steed is basically a sparkly Invincible.<br />
<br />
Heart of the Aspects is essentially a Cloud Serpent if you take the wings off.<br />
<br />
Grinning Reaver is just a Qiraji but from WoD.<br />
<br />
And you are right. You don't need a single thing off that ingame shop. It's your decision with your money to buy it. I've bought around 3 of the mounts with 1 gifted to me because I wanted them. Not because I ever felt forced into them.</div></div><hr />
