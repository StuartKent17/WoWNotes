2.3 Patch testing<br />
The arena season state is not persisting after a server reset, this is why the arena vendors keep disappearing. Also, the new arena UI is not displaying when Season 3 starts so you can not see your personal rating. Both of these issues will be fixed in an upcoming PTR build.

The broom mount only have a 14 days duration to let people get it without having to worry about keeping it as a special rare mount, this is also why the droprate is so high. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=2366736475&amp;postId=24711474733&amp;sid=1#12))<br />

Patch 2.3 Changes<br />
The [b]2.3 Changes post has been slightly updated.<br />
<br />
The screenshots of Zul'aman plate armor are available again (was changed to wowhead links at some point)<br />
The new crafts have (finally) been updated with the new leatherworking ammo pouchs/quivers.<br />
Added the [item=34129] screenshot to the new mounts, also added all the item links. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, an undocumented (well, technically it is, but not specifically) rogue change, the mace specialization +mace bonus has been changed to increased critical damage. <br />

It Give you 6% to stun for 3 sec (Not 5% as we can think )<br />
and increase crit damage with mace by 5%.<br />

It's the last point who'll give you 2% more of stun</div></div><hr />

It's just stupid. If you compare the iceblock of a mage with something similar like the palabubble you'll see that there are some differents who really make the iceblock more inefficient than a bubble. <br />
In bubble:<br />
- you can still cast<br />
- you can still move<br />
- BUT you have a CD<br />
- It's dispellable<br />
<br />
In iceblock:<br />
- you can't cast<br />
- you can't move<br />
- CD is getting higher and higher each patch, why even skill CD reset?<br />
- It's dispellable (as far as I know)<br />
<br />
... iceblock is fine, l2patch blizz.<br />

Hypothermia duration got increased because 30 seconds was short enough to let mages buy the time needed to iceblock a second time. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=2366705803&amp;postId=24689974844&amp;sid=1#4))<br />

I can only imagine the threads in the official forums... mages will qq into the sky. With quite some reason on this one. Saying a player is not supposed to use a skill twice against the same opponent is a bit ridiculous, particularly a purely defensive skill, regardless on whether its current CD was OP or not.<br />
<br />
Well, Blizzard shooting themselves in the foot as usual. Out of the top of my mind I can't remember a company with such &quot;deathwish&quot; tendency.</div></div><hr />

Actually, in the next 2.3 test realm update you'll automatically cancel your form before casting - you won't need a macro for it at all. :)<br />
