<br />
Raids, Dungeons, and Scenarios<br />
<br />
To help smooth difficulty scaling as players are added or removed from a Flexible raid, several raid boss abilities that target additional players as the size of a Flexible raid increases will use weighted randomization rather than strict breakpoints. For more information on the change, check out this thread (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/10585638963?page=4#77) on the Dungeons, Raids and Scenarios forum.<br />

Cross-Realm raid browser (located in the Social Pane under Other Raids on the Raid tab) now has a minimum item level requirement for players attempting to list for Siege of Orgrimmar on Flexible raid difficulty.<br />
<br />
Vale of Eternal Sorrows requires a minimum item level of 510.<br />
Gates of Retribution requires a minimum item level of 517.<br />

Flex Mechanic Scaling Hotfix<br />
Fun fact: The hotfix has actually been active since just before the weekend, but it didn't get caught in the prior round of hotfix notes. It's no surprise that it went largely unnoticed, since most all of the abilities with actual breakpoints going from 14-&gt;15 are things with very minor impact (Protectors' Shadow Word: Bane, Nazgrim's Bonecracker, Hisek's Multi-Shot, etc.). There are indeed a couple of more impactful breakpoints on Garrosh's Touch of Y'Shaarj and Sha of Pride's Imprison, but those both occur at raid sizes well above 14, and randomization isn't the correct solution to either.<br />
<br />
The 14-player &quot;magic number&quot; is actually a fairly interesting social dynamic, since there never was anything particularly special about the number, and now there really is objectively no advantage. As we've said in the past, there's certainly nothing wrong with wanting to form a 14-player raid, but if you're turning away strong players or friends because you're convinced that your raid as a whole will have a harder time, you're making a mistake.<br />
<br />
<br />
Changes to Flex Mechanic Scaling<br />
The previously discussed changes to scaling are now live! <br />
At BlizzCon, we'd discussed some improvements to our Flexible scaling system that would minimize the existence and impact of any real or perceived &quot;breakpoints.&quot; Our design goal has always been for the system to be neutral with respect to group size. Specifically, you should never feel encouraged to turn away interested players whose skill/gear level matches the rest of the group's, basic role composition constraints notwithstanding. But at the same time, you shouldn't feel like you need to go out and grab warm bodies if you have a perfectly serviceable raid already assembled. Clearly we have not yet fully realized those goals.<br />
<br />
In general, the existing healing/damage scaling slightly favors larger groups, since boss health and damage scale up more slowly than does raid throughput. To use a specific example, an 18-player raid with 12 damage-dealers will kill a boss slightly faster than a 10-player raid with 6 damage-dealers (assuming equal skill/gear between the two groups). But it is true that currently some specific abilities exhibit breakpoints, where adding an extra player causes an extra add to spawn, or an ability to strike an additional target.<br />
<br />
To help smooth out difficulty scaling as you add or remove players from your Flexible raid, we will be implementing one of our planned Warlords changes to the scaling system ahead of schedule. In the near future, several boss abilities that target more players as the size of a Flex raid increases will use weighted randomization rather than strict breakpoints. <br />
<br />
An example to illustrate what I mean:<br />
<br />
Today, Sun Tenderheart's Shadow Word: Bane ability afflicts 2 targets if your raid size is between 10 and 14, but begins to hit a third target at 15. <br />
<br />
Once our upcoming change is in place, if you have a 13-player raid, there will be a 60% chance for each cast of the ability to hit 3 targets, and a 40% chance for it to hit 2. If you add an extra player, and thus have 14, there will now be an 80% chance for 3 debuffs to go out, and a 20% chance for only 2. <br />
<br />
In short, with respect to this particular ability, adding an extra player will always give you an average of 0.2 extra Bane debuffs. No more breakpoints!<br />
<br />
There will be a handful of exceptions where breakpoints remain necessary. Imprison on Sha of Pride is probably the most notable such example, where you really want to pre-plan who will cover which prisons, and having a random number of targets each cast would cause frustrating unpredictability.<br />
<br />
There's nothing wrong with 14-player groups -- 14 players is a great size for a raid. But so is 15. And 19. And 12. And 22. We just want to help make sure that good players aren't being turned away from groups because of the notion that their presence will make things harder for everyone. <br />
<br />

Mounts Blocking Holiday Questgivers<br />
Grr! Yeah, some people can be jerks. Some people are just oblivious though, too. If you think someone is specifically and intentionally blocking an NPC in a malicious way, that is behavior specifically mentioned in our harassment policy, and something you can report that player for and we'll take a look.<br />
<br />
An easy workaround though is enabling nameplates for friendly characters (default Shift+V) and then right click on the nameplate of the NPC you're wanting to interact with.<br />
<br />
For me, it's the fact there's a group of around 40 horde, give or take, literally camping the greench and AoE spamming the treats and metzen preventing any alliance from completing their daily. I don't mind some PvP action on a PvP server, but this is ridiculous.<br />
Holiday events tend to be quite active the first couple days, but this one lasts for 2 1/2 weeks, and you can certainly complete most of these things throughout the event and have plenty of time to grab all the achievements/complete all the quests without needing to do everything the first day. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/285696-mounts-blocking-holiday-questgivers/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/10894850091?page=3#42))<br />

The change only stops people from listing with a low ilvl in the Raid Browser. You can still doing flex with whatever ilvl you want if you aren't using it.</div></div><hr />

True, but even though there isn't an exact limitation, it still limits the amount of damage you can do. Our budget stat amounts are based on ilvl, so you'll have less stats with less ilvl and therefore less damage, you might understand you're rotation and play a lot better, but you have a lot less potential to do more damage because of your lower ilvl and stat budget.</div></div><hr />

I interpret the post to mnean that is the minimum ilvl to list yourself in the browser, not to actually queue and zone in. If you find a group (ex: via trade chat, guild chat, or oQueue) willing to take you below Blizzard's suggested ilvl's, there's nothing stopping you.</div></div><hr />

Exactly. Some people should really read what is posted before jumping up and down all over it.<br />
This only affect the raid browser. Not flexi groups that are set up outside it. So guilds, Pugs, oqueue, etc will not be affected.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They wiped 4 times on shamans and weren't able to down Nazgrim. Doesn't disprove my point, it enforces it. My main raids on heroic, this was an alt that I'm competent with and I know the fights well. I can pull my simmed dps whereas they were in higher ilevel and couldn't come close to their sims. The ilevel restriction is meaningless.<br />

I find it cute that you're jumping to the conclusion that I jumped to the conclusion that it was for queuing when you start flex. It's quite obvious it is just for listing yourself. I don't know how anyone could possible confuse that, but you assumed I am confused. I think it's useless to put a restriction on the raid browser. That's it.</div></div><hr />

I did start to write a full response to this but then decided, what's the point ?<br />
You obviously realise your post caused some confusion but just feel like trying to throw mud about the place.<br />
Maybe you should consider writing clearer posts in future so confusion is reduced.</div></div><hr />
