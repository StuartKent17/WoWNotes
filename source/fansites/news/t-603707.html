Good Bye Salthem !<br />
Salthem is going on to other duties in Blizzard and won't be posting on official forums anymore. (Source (http://forums.wow-europe.com/thread.html?topicId=1906130993&amp;postId=19053096142&amp;sid=1#0))<br />

Zeppelins Vendors<br />
The vendors haven't been removed permanently, they will be back on duty once the propulsions issues on boats and zeppelins are fixed. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=3271121014&amp;postId=32336899207&amp;sid=1#4))<br />

Free character transfer eligibility<br />
&quot;The realms chosen consist of source realms with the highest sustained queues, and destination realms with the lowest population. The numbers gathered are directly from our data, and depict the realms in most need of these transfers. We will be continuing to monitor all realms and open additional free transfers in the future where necessary.&quot; (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=3271178841&amp;postId=32341801105&amp;sid=1#593))<br />

Character transfers<br />
Free and Paid character transfers are on a different cooldown, you can use a free transfer and then move your character again by using the paid character transfer feature. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=3270771111&amp;postId=32333507162&amp;sid=1#2))<br />

Wrath of the Lich King<br />
Don't expect WotLK too soon. Even if Blizzard would like to release an expansion a year they don't plan to rush anything for the sake of releasing one a year. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=3269180613&amp;postId=32336899996&amp;sid=1#117))<br />

Night Elf Mohawk !<br />
The Mohawk in the Mr. T advertising was a custom model made specifically for the commercial, there is no guarantee that it will be a new hair style in Wrath of the Lich King. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=3270770857&amp;postId=32336900708&amp;sid=1#33))<br />

World Events<br />
World Events can be a double edged sword, they're a very enjoyable experience for players but they take a lot of development for something only usable once most of the time. there is also the problem of forcing an entire server into a one location and all the performance issues it causes. They aren't ruled out, they just have to be planned very carefully. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=3268470999&amp;postId=32333506026&amp;sid=1#14))<br />

SK Adds U.S. WoW Squad<br />
SK Gaming are proud to announce the addition of an American World of Warcraft 3vs3 team. The players are well known from the notorious battlegroup 9 - Neilyo, Gumbot, Pronne, Mattyo and Mykke.<br />
<br />
The World of Warcraft is increasing rapidly and the American PvP scene is very competitive, especially because of the bloodlust battlegroup (bg9). This addition means that SK Gaming will have a top team from the most competative ladder in the world to represent them in future tournaments. The team will be focusing mainly on 3vs3, and by having five players the team will be able to switch to whatever fits the current patch and team best.<br />
<br />
For those of you who doesn't know, or maybe just wants to know more about the players, a brief introduction of them all can be found on SK-Gaming (http://www.sk-gaming.com/content/15270-SK_Adds_US_WoW_Squad).<br />

Feast of Winter Veil 2007<br />
The Feast of Winter Veil will start on December 15 and will include some new features.<br />
<br />
The [item=21213] that players can get from completing special holiday quests can now be used on flying mounts. This will temporarily turn their flying mount into a flying reindeer (http://www.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2007/october/flyreind.jpg) that trails sparkles as it flies through the air<br />
Handful of Snowflakes - this is a new item you can obtain by /kiss -ing a Winter Reveler NPC. It will create a light snowfall above any targeted player.<br />
Burning Crusade Holiday Bosses - as in past years, certain bosses will be dressed in a festive fashion and will drop seasonal hats when defeated. The holiday versions of the bosses will begin on Dec. 25 and end on Jan. 2. These bosses include:<br />
Grand Warlock Netherkurse (Shattered Halls)<br />
Grandmaster Vorpil (Shadow Labyrinth)<br />
Exarch Maladaar (Auchenai Crypts)<br />
Captain Skarloc (Durnholde Keep)<br />
Nethermancer Sepethrea (Mechanar)<br />
High Botanists Freywinn (Botanica)<br />
Mechanotoy - This is a new gift that can be obtained from under the Winter Veil tree in Ironforge and Orgrimmar. It lets you summon a Mechanotoy non-combat pet to follow you around.
