Tell me how the hell that spell isn't overpowered at the moment, lol. It breaks CC, increases movement speed, has no CD, and has a capability of 100% uptime.<br />

<br />
If it kicked in once the effect weared off, you could still spam it and nothing would have changed. I think the CD is there to prevent Rogues from spamming themselves free from snares. They still get a 100% uptime on it, though.</div></div><hr />

It doesn't &quot;break CC&quot; it removes slows on themselves which is not classified as a CC. You can root them in place and BoS will do nothing but waste 30 energy. Good for them for wasting cloak or vanish on such a trivial thing because those are major CDs that could be used for so much more. The class doesn't have ranged grips, ranged slows, ranged stuns or a Step on 12sec CD. They have BoS in an attempt to stay on their target because any distance makes the class worthless. Rogues suffered significant problems before BoS because how easy it was to CC and/or keep them slowed. After SStep nerf it was quite frustrating to play the class once others began having passive slows, instant roots or just low CDs for both.</div></div><hr />

First of all, it's called sarcasm, perhaps you've heard of it. My point is they made one change and it did absolutely nothing to help dps. Secondly, our TOP spec right now is running 30% lower dps than the top 5 specs. That is a HUGE gap for a class whose only purpose is dps. You probably should have a clue what you're talking about before you tell someone they're probably not playing their class right. I don't expect to be top dps every fight, but I do think that if I have the same level of gear as say a mage, we should at least be competitive, not 7k dps behind every fight.</div></div><hr />

Yes because sarcasm is so easy to detect with the written word. You are aware more changes are coming right? And 30%? 7k dps behind in every fight? The hyperbole is strong in this one. If you are in fact that far behind I stand by my original comment that it's a L2P issue, not the class as a whole. Rogues can do good DPS if played well.</div></div><hr />

No, they aren't that bad at all. The main issue is the gear available in Highmaul, the stats are awful for us (Sub and Assassi to some extent) and that makes us look bad, in reality it's just not that far off from other classes. BRF will fix that, sadly the FOTM rerollers from MoP do not understand these things and qq about classes being bad when it's just them, same applies to Warlocks for the most part.</div></div><hr />

+ my opinion seeing them in game: during that animation when they stand still, they twist their had way too much, neck would break, and the grinn they make is too much as well, while the other &quot;standing still&quot; animation is a way too much smiling face, it just doesn't look good together. Skin color number 8 is darker than it used to be ( I think it's important to say, because that's the only thing we can't change on existing models). Hair style number 1 is too much bouncy in game, imo.<br />

This!<br />
<br />
There are so many qq-ers in any WoW forum, all from different classes. Each class has numerous ways of how to deal with situations, and any class has a niche they're very good at.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
You're a joke. Look again at the rankings that are actually there before putting down a comment such as this one. It shows your lack of skill (7k dps behind LOL).<br />
<br />
Here you'll see see the simmed rankings @ noxxic from a realistic point of single target:<br />
http://www.noxxic.com/wow/dps-rankings#BiS,real,1<br />
<br />
And here you'll see the rankings of actual raids for MYTHIC raiding, the only raid that classes should be attuned at, since these logs are the only reliable source of information on how a class is able to perform:<br />
http://www.worldoflogs.com/ranking/eu-us/highmaul/dps/<br />
<br />
Do you see that combat rogues actually perform incredibly well at the mythic raiding logs, while being simmed much lower on single target? And that they're not 7k below any other class on any sim, as you're suggesting? Do I see my class on these logs (Shadow Priest) and am I whining about it?<br />
<br />
People talk out of their ass on forums. And people should see that they're talking shit when it comes to dps / rankings / CC clearings etc. <br />
<br />
Stop your whining. All of you. And enjoy the beautiful new Blood Elfs that have been given to you.</div></div><hr />

Damn man that is quite a buff to damage. Not so much in the even distribution part(though an extra 100,000 damage is pretty nuts) but in the single target hit / dot. It hurt pretty badly to begin with, wonder what inspired that change(instead of to other mechanics like, cave in).</div></div><hr />

Weeaboo would be right if it was Japanese. Pandaria was a Chinese theme and also consisted of lore that was already in the Warcraft universe. If you think it's worse than adding a fucking selfie camera into the game, all I can do is pity you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Terrible, and nothing to aspire towards for the BE models.<br />
<br />
That said, having tested PTR my observations are thus:<br />
<br />
Females:<br />
<br />
-Horseface is by and large not an issue, except on some faces, but with the geometry sets unique to each face not released, doesn't matter too much just yet.<br />
-They have quite the funny idle emote now, with a smile and then a full on sneer. This is pleasing on the more neutral faces, but on the ones with fuller features it can look a bit OTT.<br />
-Physique is much better, fuller and looks healthier and athletic. They look almost as big as human females, but lither, taller and more graceful.<br />
-Casting animations much as before, just more fluid. Unlike the NE female, this has not ruined them for me.<br />
-Their run and walk are both good. Little divergence from before in this respect.<br />
-Their emotes are mostly understated. There's a wee bit of exaggeration in some, but nothing like some of the other, &quot;bouncier&quot; female models.<br />
-The 2H weapons look large when they're being wielded but not when on her back.<br />
<br />
So far, 7/10.<br />
<br />
Males:<br />
<br />
-The face Blizzard has used is just awkward. It works with some options really well, where it gives them a sort of cocky he-man look. But on others it just looks awful. I suppose, again, the unique geometry sets will rectify this.<br />
-Idle pose is significantly less awkward. It could still be better but it looks better, particularly from one side. <br />
-Targeted casting animation is, IMO, significantly better. It has the same vibe that the Eredar one does, almost as though the caster is sculpting the spell, and it does a better job of portraying that air of confidence BE are meant to possess.<br />
-Run and walk are not hugely different to before, but they were fine anyway.<br />
-Musculature is far more visible and a bit more pronounced, so they look sturdy now. The chest is a bit flatter but overall the body has a healthy, strong vibe to it.<br />
-Some of the hairstyles look much better (as in, insanely better) , e.g. the Sephiroth one. Others still need work.<br />
-Some emotes have that irritating big mouth thing most other male models are plagued with. However, overall, they don't have too many of these goofy sort of features. They have a cocky, chauvinist vibe to them, sort of a macho superhero type.<br />
<br />
So far, 8/10. My favourite new male model, for sure.<br />
<br />
For both:<br />
<br />
-They lack the cool DK customisation options draenei got, in their present iteration. <br />
-Skin tones are more pronounced, so they have a significant variety of skin tones now. E.g. the tans look much more noticeable.<br />
-Hair is fantastic on both.<br />
-They look animated and lively, like most of the new models.<br />
-They have a slightly similar vibe to the Cassians of Wildstar now.<br />
<br />
What I'd like to see going forward:<br />
-More rectification of the BE male posture and a better channel animation, e.g. when summoning.<br />
-Facial customisation options such as tattoos for both genders, and stubble for males; it suits their roguish charm.<br />
-Full body tattoo options.<br />
-The full gamut of new faces, with their new geometry sets deployed.<br />
-Further improvements and refinements, e.g. new hairstyles or improvement of hairstyles that still look unappealing.<br />
-More pronounced thigh muscularity and buttocks for the males, to balance out the overall body.<br />
-This goes for most models - less clipping of hair!<br />
-Cheer emote just looks... strange on male BE, perhaps less of the gaping maw?<br />
-Stop the bizarre clipping of the waist when using a bow and strafing left on the male BE.</div></div><hr />

why cant you do anything right blizzard<br />
<br />
Because, then you wouldnt have something you could complaint about and wouldt that be a shame, since you cant live without complaining?<br />
<br />
And if you complainers and whiners had taken the 2 seconds it takes to read the blue post about the updated BE model, you would have seen this<br />
<br />
&quot;Right now, the new models are more or less using the same facial geometry set - as in, all the males will have the same chin, eye shape, nose shape, etc. These are currently slated to be added to the models in an upcoming 6.1 build.&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
+ my opinion seeing them in game: during that animation when they stand still, they twist their had way too much, neck would break, and the grinn they make is too much as well, while the other &quot;standing still&quot; animation is a way too much smiling face, it just doesn't look good together. Skin color number 8 is darker than it used to be ( I think it's important to say, because that's the only thing we can't change on existing models). Hair style number 1 is too much bouncy in game, imo.<br />

The leaders use the standard character model so they'll automatically be updated to the new model.<br />
<br />
The Silvermoon Guardians have a unique model based on the blood elf model from the BC alpha, and their equipment is unique to that model, so I wouldn't expect an upgrade.</div></div><hr />

if the game keeps going the way its going, in a few expansions they will remove legacy gear and just give you a pinata that gives you a level every time you hit it until you get to 100.</div></div><hr />

Reroll a ret if you want that; bear in mind these aren't the promised class changes, those are to come soon, and DKs (and rets) may well receive nerfs then.</div></div><hr />
