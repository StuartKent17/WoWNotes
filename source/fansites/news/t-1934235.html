Legion - Magni, Eitrigg, and The Ashbringer<br />
We found some interesting conversations with important NPCs about Artifact weapons. One example is a conversation you can have with Magni or Eitrigg about The Ashbringer. Unfortunately there isn't much more than what is below yet. Keep in mind that this is just a reference in an alpha build of Legion, not something final or officially announced.<br />
<br />
Magni Bronzebeard and The Ashbringer<br />
Well if ain't the Highlord $Ghimself:herself;! I reckon' it's good for even the hardiest of us to take a moment and reflect now and again. I'm right fond of this spot. <br />
Take a seat with me for a moment, won't ye? <br />
The Ashbringer is a truly wondrous blade, ain't it? I remember forging it many years ago back in Ironforge - my finest work. <br />
If ye don't mind an old dwarf talkin' yer ear off, I'd like to share a piece of advice with ye that I've carried with me since I was a lad. <br />
We all come from the same earth and stone around us; Alliance and Horde, dwarf and gnome- as a leader, ye've got to see past the differences and unite yer people against the Legion. Azeroth depends on it. <br />
I'll give ye some time alone. Just somethin' to think about in the days ahead. <br />
<br />
Eitrigg and The Ashbringer<br />
Throm-Ka, Highlord $p. I see we both value some peace and quiet now and again. <br />
Sit with me if you would - just for a few moments. <br />
Tirion was my brother by blood. We saved one another's lives many moons ago. He was a good man... an honorable man. <br />
He always thought highly of you - from what I hear from others his trust has not been misplaced. <br />
I have watched many lead their people down dark paths. Tirion often spoke of the Light that guided his hand and his people - let it guide you to greatness as well. <br />
I am not one for conversation - much remains to be done. May our paths cross again, $p. <br />

Blue Tweets<br />
Transmogrification<br />
Will Rogues have the ability to mog their artifact weapons into other stuff?This being outlaws with axes and fist weps<br />
You can transmogrify your artifact into other weapons within the current, existing transmogrification weapon-type rules. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/685267638847553536))<br />
<br />
<br />
Ghostcrawler Tweets<br />
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br />
Prestige based on luck has no real value. Give me prestige based on skill and/or dedication.<br />
Neither skill nor dedication will provide an item that only a few players will own. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/685553129270591488))<br />
Maybe having a super rare item like that just isn't feasible. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/685553196710801408))<br />
<br />
Why in Cata post mortem you said Legendaries should not be like a reputation grind and Mists had 3 Rep grinds for Legendary?<br />
Different legendaries. Cataclysm model was 1-2 per guild raid. Mists legendaries were for virtually everyone. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/685552086566633472))<br />
This is relevant to the discussion of rarity we've been having on twitter lately. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/685552256897318913))<br />
Say as a designer you want 1% of players to have an item for prestige or bragging purposes. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/685552450275639296))<br />
RNG is about the only tool in your box. along grind doesn't limit number of players, only the rate they acquire them. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/685552636209172480))<br />
Skill means the world first guilds have them and nobody else. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/685552706333720576))<br />
Systems to deliver rare rewards in the absence of low RNg-based drop rates are *very* hard to design. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/685552935112060928))<br />

<br />
A long grind, by its nature, does limit the number of players. We saw it even in the census data that MMO-C linked regarding the cloak/ring/etc. <br />
<br />
At most, you get 50% of the player population getting the first reward. The drop-off after that is huge.<br />
<br />
So I guess my question to him is, &quot;What is your definition of 'everybody,' and what is your definition of 'rare?'&quot;</div></div><hr />

Drop-off has many reasons, most related to not continuing to play (in the grind, or at all).<br />
<br />
If those players continued to play, then they are not limited, unless removal occurs (MoP).</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
This tells you nothing, a lot of players (myself included) only do the quest chain up to the first or second reward on most chars just to get the easy upgrade in the start.<br />
<br />
I got the ring on my main, every alt char has either the first or the second one to get the proc.<br />
<br />
With the latest patch even less people will have been going for the first one or two since pvp rewards or plain baleful items are just as good and a lot simpler to get.</div></div><hr />

Lower percentage of Pet Battle monuments than mythic raiders. This tells you something about grind as a gating instrument. Of course, pet battles are not that important to people as mounts or titles, for example, but anyway.<br />
<br />
I would like to have bad luck protection against RNG when handling low % drop rates. Like for example - if you don't get a 1% mount until your 100th try, you will surely get it on try 101.<br />

It's by far the hardest since the whole group needs to do the dance and it can't be overgeared, which is a good thing. Still, thinking back to when I did it in MoP most of us could perform the dance after 2-5 tries, but this one player failed over and over again. She must have kept us there for an extra 15 tries alone which really soured the experience.<br />

This is a nice fix too, though. <br />

Also, stuff from Magni makes me very happy, as he's sort of been in limbo since pre-cata, with no mentioning as to if he was actually dead or if the spirit thrall found under Eastern Kingdoms was indeed him.</div></div><hr />

<br />
WTF? Ok removing &quot;Show Me Your Moves&quot; makes sence, not so much but still. But &quot;Holding Hands&quot;? It's easily soloable for any pet class or duo-able (is there word like this?) for everyone else. How about turning every meta into &quot;Zone-in into raid XXX&quot; then?</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you're a tank class you can easily solo 3-6 mobs and get about 50-60 claws. Once everyone is 110 it will be very easy to do.<br />
<br />
It's insane how many claws Blizzard expects to get for that mount. To be honest it should be at least half that amount.</div></div><hr />

I just did the daily that awarded the claws and bought the mount like a month ago. The ACHIEVEMENT to LOOT 5000 is a pain in the rear since the quest rewarded ones don't count, but getting 5000 claws just for the mount is easy.<br />
<br />
Curious Magni's back. Funny how Blizzard attempted to sweep that under the rug saying things are subject to change but seems he's back after all. That is unless Blizzard's trolling dataminers and they're going to swap out Magni for someone else (dialogue included) later on. So guess Magni wasn't really gone after but does make you wonder if he's a walking diamond now or if he's back to his old self. The string for the datamined Magni said he was a mechanical so seems he may be a walking diamond. So guess alliance lost Varian and (re)gain Magni. Meanwhile, horde still loses Vol'jin but we don't know if they gain anyone. Magni returning kind of spits in Cairne's face, though. Cairne is decidedly dead and won't be coming back while Magni was apparently frozen. Meanwhile, Varian and Vol'jin both end up lost. So horde lose 2 leaders and alliance 1. Then again, Malfurion could end up lost in Legion so if that's true, that evens things out again.<br />
<br />
Rather hard to do a game when war's involved because people will always complain when one side gets the short end of the stick. Makes multiplayer games based on war get rather old. There's never really a clear winner, and if there is, the losing side will be pissed. They'll be even more pissed if it was just chosen for them to lose by the writers possibly flipping a simple coin resulting in the players having no say in the matter or the ability to even try to win.</div></div><hr />

There was nothing regarding Magni Bronzebeard in the Legion trailer. The datamined Legion dialogue is the first indication of anything about Magni since he got changed into a crystal statue in the WarCraft novel, The Shattering: A Prelude to Cataclysm.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Shouldn't the Ashbringer details be under a spoiler tag?<br />
Using the spoiler tag breaks any formatting used for the hidden text. For example:<br />
<br />
test<br />
<br />
<br />
versus<br />
<br />
<br />
test<br />
<br />
<br />
I'd rate the spoiler as only minor anyway since it doesn't involve any key plot events in and of itself (sorry Magni).</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think he's seen as more insightful because people try to have proper conversations with him. Most people get defensive/angry/accusatory when talking to current devs, making thoughtful conversation a bit more difficult. Ghostcrawler probably has a bit more freedom about what he's allowed to say, too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Those achievements are not hard to do anymore, they could remove the achievements after every xpansion release thus leaving even less content for people to do on their off time, or simply do this and make everyone but a handful of people happy. <br />
<br />
We could go back to the grind, grind grind days, let see how many subs come back and how many leave.</div></div><hr />

Must be sad to discover that there are millions of other people playing, and is more important to keep most of them happy, and not some few that invested all of their self-esteem in a specific achievement of a meta. <br />
Time to find another object to invest the self-esteem in its exclusivity.</div></div><hr />

Moderators have nothing to do with the content of the news. These are very minor spoilers at best.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If I remember correctly, he's a Bodyguard for Warriors from a datamining a while back. It will be interesting to see what they'll do with Bodyguards/follower type characters this time. I saw a lot of major story characters listed, and hope there are quests with them as part of your 'reputation'. That would be a very welcome change to add more depth to your relationship with them.</div></div><hr />
