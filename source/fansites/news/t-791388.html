Patch Notes<br />
World of Warcraft Client Patch 4.0.3<br />
<br />
The latest patch notes can always be found at http://www.wow-europe.com/en/patchnotes/<br />
<br />
The latest test realm patch notes can always be found at http://www.wow-europe.com/en/info/underdev/testrealm.html<br />
<br />
General<br />
<br />
Much of the data being downloaded in patch 4.0.3 will pave the way for the shattering of Azeroth shortly before the release of World of Warcraft: Cataclysm on December 7.<br />
The leader of Wintergrasp raids can no longer kick players from the raid (this change will also apply to Tol Barad in Cataclysm).<br />
When in a Looking For Dungeon group, using an instance portal to that instance will now take players to the Looking For Dungeon entrance point instead of the normal destination of that portal. This will make it easier to return to the instance after dying in an LFD group.<br />
Honorable Kills are no longer awarded for killing players below level 5.<br />
<br />
<br />
User Interface<br />
<br />
Added pets to the new raid unit frames when displayed in party.<br />
The default UI Scale has been altered so it will be set at a 1:1 pixel/texel ratio. This will result in a smaller UI appearance for higher resolution monitors.<br />
Players may now adjust the local &quot;Lag Tolerance&quot; time for better precision of spell timing. This is an advanced-users-only feature found in the Interface Options (Combat) panel.<br />
<br />
<br />
Bug Fixes<br />
<br />
Macros now handle spell variant transitions better. For example, Trap Launcher causes a different version of Frost Trap to be cast. Previously the macro system was not handling this transition properly.<br />
Queuing in Looking For Dungeon for a different wing of the instance a player is already in now works properly. For example, a party can now queue for Scarlet Monastery - Library after completing Scarlet Monastery - Graveyard.<br />
Killing High Interrogator Gerstahn before killing Emperor Dagran Thaurissan in a Blackrock Depths - Upper City random Looking For Dungeon run will now provide the proper reward. This also applies to Archmage Arugal and the Crown Chemical Company bosses in Shadowfang Keep during the Love is in the Air holiday event.<br />
Repeatedly inspecting other players should now function correctly.<br />
Area heal-over-time effects should no longer cause players to stand up.<br />
Male blood elves have received a crash course in dancing and now know to stop dancing when they run.<br />
Drake mounts have gotten bored with gliding and will flap their wings again when flying forward.<br />
Druid Flight Form now properly appears in the Spellbook before Expert Riding is learned.<br />
Sunfire's damage-over-time effect now deals damage at the same rate as Moonfire's damage- over-time effect.<br />
GM Ticket messages should now displace buff icons instead of obscuring them.</div></div><hr />

That's what we all said six years ago about tab-targetting being fixed, maybe the next expansion after Cataclysm will fix it. =P</div></div><hr />

I know 4.0.3 is the massive patch and is this week, but for all intents and purposes 4.0.3a is the one that turns it all on and will be the one that will require a lot of monitoring and support by the Blizzard team.<br />

That's not true. Canada Celebrates a thanksgiving as well. But theirs is in October. But still...not the only place on the planet.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I wonder if they mean, for example, when fighting these Pre-Cata 5-man bosses in ZF, Mara, BRD, and AQ20 that when you die and run back to the portal that you will be zapped to that boss room instead of the regular first room of the instance. Right now in order to achieve that behavior you have to run back, go in the portal, exit the portal, and click on &quot;Teleport to Dungeon&quot; on the minimap to go back to the boss room.<br />
<br />
In other words, i think they want to make manually entering the instance portal the same as clicking on the &quot;Teleport to Instance&quot; minimap icon button.</div></div><hr />

I mean, I'm used to getting information second hand (via translated reports) and/or later than the rest of the world when it comes to overseas companies, is it unreasonable to expect the most current information on a US game to be available on the US website?<br />

How awesome would it be to phase in the shattering without a restart? You're just running around a zone and the land starts to crack, Desolace starts to flood, part of Stormwind blows up, etc.<br />

I just had this image of running through the Barrens or 1K Needles and suddenly the ground just disappears or you're under 50 ft of water as they &quot;phase&quot; the world changes in :-) I'm certain a restart of the servers will be required if only to prevent that</div></div><hr />

Activating 4.0.3 patch with 4.0.3a is likely trivial. However, chances are that things will go wrong. Despite the PTR testing process, bugs are often abundant when there is a new major patch activated on live servers. I would think this patch would be especially prone to bugs since it changes A LOT of things in the game (zones, quests, new class combos, etc.) so it isn't hard to imagine that Blizzard staff will be very, VERY busy on the week they activate 4.0.3a</div></div><hr />

<br />
All of this stuff is already implemented in this patch and has been worked on / under development / tested in the beta all year. All the stuff that was implemented that would be most prone to bugs (The 4.0.1 changes) have all been fixed and worked on. This patch will be much, MUCH easier on the developers than 4.0.1 is. Don't believe me? Think back to BC. The patch that implemented the new talents was almost as rough as 4.0.1. When Northrend became accessible, there were hardly any issues (Until people could start raiding)<br />

<br />
&quot;For those of you who attended or watched BlizzCon 2010 and claimed a Deathy pet, you may have noticed that he’s acting strange. In fact, he seems to think he’s Grunty the Murloc Marine. This is an unintended consequence of the groupthink from which all murlocs suffer. Deathy will be undergoing an extensive rehabilitation program and should be acting appropriately destructive once his idol, Deathwing, shatters the world in an upcoming patch that will debut prior to the release of World of Warcraft: Cataclysm.&quot;<br />

<br />
<br />
It broke the event for the attack on the city. Nothing spawns now so now you can't do anything. What a great event.</div></div><hr />

Got mine about a week ago.</div></div><hr />

'cos right now, my little Murlocky dude still sounds like he's talking through a particularly crackly intercom.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is a reason though, after you've defended both cities once, it's kind of boring... The elementals aren't even a challenge because it may as well be a 100 man raid at each portal.</div></div><hr />

deathy was shipped without his animations and this bug should be fixed in 4.0.3. <br />
<br />
not fixed :(</div></div><hr />

Lurky = still broken (makes the dancing sounds but just stands there and doesn't dance. :( sad panda)<br />
<br />
Also, the Ironforge invasion is broken. The thing starts and is over in like a minute with no rifts even appearing. How do they manage to make so many cock-ups with every patch? I know they fix a ton of shizz, but they always seem to break new things every time.<br />
<br />
Ah well. At least the gryphon-on-death is no longer slower than walking!</div></div><hr />
