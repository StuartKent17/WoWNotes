Blizzcast - Episode 8<br />
Blizzcast Episode 8 (http://eu.blizzard.com/blizzcast/archive/episode8.xml) is out! This new episode focus on Diablo 3 mostly and only 2 questions related to WoW were answered. <br />
Bornakk: Good good. The first question today is from Sneakysnakes on Wildhammer. Before Wrath of the Lich King came out there was talk of aerial combat in Wintergrasp and in the game in general with some goblin anti-air shredder being put in the game. Howling Fjord showed some footage of this as well. What happened with aerial combat and do we still plan to put it into the game?<br />
<br />
Tom Chilton: Well the aerial combat that we had in Wintergrasp we just ended up feeling wasn’t really polished enough for the final experience. We gave it a shot with the vehicle technology that we had but ultimately it was a little goofy that you could crash your airplane into the ground and nothing bad would really happen. Then also the kinda of sense of flying really wasn’t there enough. <br />
<br />
If you look at a lot of games that have done flight simulation, there is a lot of care that goes into giving you that sensation of flying by having the world tilt and stuff like that so it feels a little less mechanical, feels a little bit more alive or more natural. So one of the things that we have kind of tasked ourselves with doing is figuring out how to polish that, how to improve on our vehicle physics, there’s still a lot of vehicle physics tech that we want to get in that didn’t make it into the first pass of Lich King. <br />
<br />
So we have to make some tough decisions sometimes about what we are going to go forward with and what just isn’t working out well enough to meet our quality standards and that was one of them. So it’s still definitely on our list of things that we want to do, we have a lot of people here who are passionate about vehicle combat, passionate about making it more interesting, more fun, by increasing the number of things we can do with it – that would definitely include the possibility of doing aerial combat. <br />
<br />
Bornakk: The other question from the same player was just if we had any plans to add any additional ranks to Wintergrasp, the battle there, and to expand on the system in general?<br />
<br />
Tom Chilton: Well the things we would have to think as far as ranks in Wintergrasp go would be kind of how it ties into the game play as it’s established right now. Really the purpose of the ranks is to give you access to new kinds of vehicles and in the absense of new kinds of vehicles to give you then that doesn’t really seem to be something we need to do. It wouldn’t really add a whole lot of value, it wouldn’t be that interesting if you ranked up but there was nothing really anything new to get as a result of it. <br />
<br />
Then we also have to factor in the combat time, how much time do you actually spend in the Wintergrasp scenario and is it reasonable to expect a player to actually get to that higher rank? Do they have enough time to get to a higher rank and actually have time to enjoy the result of getting to that rank? So since we have really tried to make sure Wintergrasp is playable in a very reasonable period of time the scenario doesn’t tend to go a really long time then it doesn’t seem to me, at least not at first glance, that we would really have room to add an additional rank for an additional vehicle even if we were to actually create that vehicle and make it accessible. I don’t think you’d have a whole lot of time to do much with it. <br />
<br />
Bornakk: Okay, well that’s all the questions that we had today. Thanks for stopping by Tom and we’ll roll on to the next questions.<br />
<br />
Tom Chilton: Right on.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
They don't have to have the patch and arena season end on the same day.<br />
Would be better but not something they will hold the patch back on imo.<br />
<br />
Could get arena season announcement tomorrow, patch next tuesday and arena season end the week after.<br />
Who knows.</div></div><hr />

They've stated that arena season will come shortly after patch, so probably a few weeks after.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I bet they end Season 5 on Patch Day with 3.1 and start season 6 1-2 weeks after that. Releasing 3.1 while season 5 is still active would alter gameplay in arena, and right now i dont think Blizzard wants to lose 80% of the DK's ,Paladin, Hunters that are above 2k rating ;)</div></div><hr />

Spamming sunder armor, speccing into Mace Spec and gemming for ArP is fail tho :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
The gemming part i agree is not worth it but not putting 5 sunders up is just retarded on your part lol...seriously.<br />
<br />
You think Axe is better?<br />
You get a auto crit MS every 12 seconds and like an 85%+ crit rate on overpower.<br />
The Mace spec 15% arm pen is worth over 5% more damage on every attack, not just crits.<br />
So just how again is Axe better?<br />
<br />
<br />
Pally with 24k armor<br />
Your attacks hit for 2000 before armor<br />
you hit pally for 780<br />
<br />
45% ArP<br />
Pally now has 13K armor <br />
You are now hitting pally for 1060<br />
<br />
35% damage increase<br />

sums it up pretty much.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fugazi</div><div class="date">2009-03-30, 08:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">They never end arena season same day as major patch and never will.<br />
<br />
Reason is that ending seasons creates problems like:<br />
- &quot;X got mount while he wasn't in top&quot;<br />
- &quot;I was in top but didn't got mount&quot;<br />
- &quot;wtf I didn't get title/got wrong title&quot;<br />
etc.<br />
<br />
Therefore they always wait few weeks so they can fix problems (that are bound to happen) with new major patch, then release minor fixing patch or two and start new arena season.<br />
<br />
Also there will be new build on PTR there is blue post confirming this. We should be very close to final now, there will be one or two new builds after this one before live. So patch release is most likely 7th April (14 in case of major bugs).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nah, i don't think we'll get that lucky.<br />
Maybe they mention rogues when they talk about some of the other classes.<br />
Like.. ( &quot; Warlocks needs more survivability, they die in 5 gcds. And i am not just refering to rogues here &quot; ).<br />
Or somethin like that.</div></div><hr />

sirsly don't comment on a class you don't know about it's doesn't stack that way it's 20% x 15% and then x X% you have on your items so just with no extra armor pen it's 30% not 35%</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually, iirc a blue mentioned that should they need more time testing, they will just push the Noblegarden event back to whenever 3.1 goes live.<br />
<br />
It is, technically, &quot;Noblegarden&quot; in Azeroth and not Easter in real world so Bliz and only Bliz has the finaly say.</div></div><hr />

And the 10% from Battle stance is where?<br />
<br />
Dude....you lost any credibility when you said sunder armor was fail lol<br />
<br />
Also...I garentee you I have forgotten more about warriors then you have even known.<br />
75000 hk's, 2k+ in every bracket in arena's through the first 4 seasons and I have tanked every single boss in the game at their proper levels.<br />
<br />
<br />
5 sunder armors was counted first before when it was a flat amount, they would then do the ARP %'s after.<br />
Now that's it's a flat 4% per stack that changes things.<br />
Some things stack, some are multiplied<br />
<br />
5 Sunders + Battle Stance + Mace spec is still about 38-39% total arp as multiplicative.<br />
<br />
Someone has already been busy figuring it all for us.<br />
http://eu-warrior.com/arpen.html?ta=24000&amp;pl=80&amp;arp=10&amp;sa=on&amp;bs=on&amp;ms=on&amp;tar=<br />
<br />
BTW Mace spec on it's own is 10%+ more damage on targets 24000 armor or more.</div></div><hr />

well i didn't say battle stans sens i didn't remember how much it gave now and i got that it doesn't stack like you say on elitist jerks and some posts on here on mmo-champ and done every boss and Hk doesn't mean you can do threoy craft now does it??

Exactly the changes needed! Right on!<br />
Although I suspect something like:<br />
Leather too op for rogues, you can only wear cloth now.<br />
vanish is working as intended dont worry guis!!!<br />
Cold blood tooltip has now been changed to &quot;really cold blood&quot; and if you dont use that ability 6 seconds after you press it, you are affected by frost fever AND a dk spawns next to you and pwns you so use it wisely.<br />
mutilate damage lowered by another 20%</div></div><hr />

Mace is better vs high armored targets <br />
Axe is better vs low armored targets<br />
They come out about even in the middle ground<br />

I am surprised how they have not fired Tom Chilton yet. I am surprised that they hired him in the first place roflmao!</div></div><hr />

saw it and think like this 1% crit raiting is 46 crit raitning so u need 230 raitning so compensate for the crit loss and u still got the 5% more dmg on cirt<br />
and then armor pen 1% armor pen is 15 raitning 225 raitning is needed so 5 less raitning<br />
and try this on the calc move the 15% crit from mace to your armor pen (while you have like 10% armorpen) and you will see an upp in dmg<br />
<br />
EDIT1 : i think pve and not pvp like you are</div></div><hr />

Well...no offence but my org comment was pvp based soooo....<br />
Also...you're still not going to go arms for PvE. Arms may catch up a bit due to buffs to it and nerfs to fury, however, fury will still be higher dps.<br />
Arms has never recovered from the first Windfury nerf when it was changed to proc auto attack only let alone the big second one removing the extra attack all together.<br />
<br />
There was nothing quite like going with the original sword spec with the original windfury and spamming hamstring to the top of the dps charts lol!<br />
<br />
Or even more old school, going 20/31 2H fury with a BRE and beating out and laughing at the dual weilders</div></div><hr />

You know what worries me the most about that comment of his ? That by that logic our flying mounts don't meet their quality standards either ('omg screen doesn't tilt when I turn' or 'wth it flies backwards' or 'it flies upsidedown and doesn't fall' etc etc).<br />
<br />
I think it's silly to try to get those things compared to flight simulators... it's like saying hunters are a poor class because you can't dodge the arrows.</div></div><hr />

This is and always be a majority pve game and pvp already causes alot of classes that only do pve to get nerfed. I wish pvp could be allocated to just pvp servers and that only on those servers could you spec into certain classes so raiders dont have to be nerfed for the minority.</div></div><hr />
