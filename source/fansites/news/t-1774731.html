WoW Down to 7.1 Million Subscribers<br />
Blizzard had their Q1 2015 earnings call today, announcing that WoW is down to 7.1 million subscribers at the end of Q1 2015. This is down 2.9 million from the Q4 2014 call (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/4694-WoW-Stable-at-10-Million-Subscribers) that listed WoW at 10 million subscribers. This appears to be the largest drop in subscriber count in the history of the game.<br />
<br />
<br />
Tokens are not included in this timeframe, as they launched in Q2.<br />
World of Warcraft’s revenue performance at constant FX has been more stable, driven by continued strong uptake on value added services, and price increases in select regions, which partially offset subscriber declines, particularly in the East.<br />
Heroes of the Storm had over 11 million beta sign-ups.<br />
Hearthstone is now at 30 million players, up from 25 million last quarter. <br />

<br />
Personally, I blame the garrison and an utter lack of diversified content (it's been over 6 months and counting since release, still no content patch) as the root of most of the issues for pve players.<br />
<br />
Also, whatever happened to the dream of creating a marriage between Timeless Isle and the 5.1 dailies? Why did we just get an even worse timeless isle?<br />
<br />
On average, this means they lost a net sub every 4 seconds since the expansion went live.</div></div><hr />

<br />
WoW tokens count as being subbed. They don't check who's buying WoW tokens and who isn't, they check what your account is flagged as, and if you would go and look at your account management page, It still says &quot;Subscribed&quot; even with WoW token active instead.</div></div><hr />

Personally, I blame the Garrison as the root of most of the issues for pve players.<br />
<br />
I don't and I'm one of the 2.9m that pulled the plug.., my main issue is the entire setup described as content a'la 4 difficulties and now coming to dungeons also.<br />
It isn't content, it doesn't get more interesting as you push Mythic, it does in fact just get 100% more repetitive and boring, no amount of items, mounts, titles or anything will ever make me return to the current setup of WoW as it stinks more than watching paint dry!<br />
<br />
Did I care about using my gold to buy game time?- Hell no, why would I, it isn't changing the overarching issue.</div></div><hr />

They tried the player housing, but there are several other games that do it so much better. Garrisons lack the customization that other player housing has currently. And I think they underestimated how much no flying was going to affect the game as a whole. And as much people complain about daily quests, wow had the highest sub numbers when there were a lot of daily quests to do.</div></div><hr />

Are we honestly surprised? Sure there always a spike when a expansion hits.. People buy it and see that shit hasn't changed or gotten worse they leave...<br />
<br />
I mean whats to do online now? Raids which doesn't take much to clear, the garrison(i say worse addition to the game there is and fucked the tradeskills of this game), and the laughing stock that what we call PvP anymore =\<br />
<br />
Theres no dailies anymore and all &quot;daily&quot; gold really comes from follower quests that only require 2 mins to send them out.<br />
<br />
When there wasn't anything to do in the game for me, there was always PvP or dungeon runs for heirlooms or valor but theres no more Valor and just 1 daily quest easily completed in 10 mins and I swear PvP in this game is getting worse the more and more they try to fix it... Burst is so high and the healing power of healers in PvP is stupid...</div></div><hr />

Yeah dailies got blamed hardcore but the issue was never dailies themselves, merely the mandatory rewards and currency vendors gated behind them. WoD's faction reward system was great but the faction felt lifeless and were just straight mob grinds. Dailies + cosmetic focused rewards would have been perfect.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard, you need to remember that it's carrots-on-sticks and time/effort reward schemes that keeps players interested in MMO's, not throwing everything at them at once and then appear confused as they aren't keen on staying subscribed. You've added way too many &quot;improvements&quot; that together make WoW unable to keep players interested and motivated.<br />

It's a terrible shame. No reason it had to be this way. I still feel like Blizzard is officially &quot;done&quot; with Warlords. Yea sure, there's some new stuff coming out in 6.2 that looks pretty good, but its the only real post-release content we'll probably get. I haven't seen a whisper (please correct me if I'm wrong) of a 6.3. They added so many people to the WoW development team, so what are they doing? Next expansion.<br />
<br />
I feel like I was being read a story by Blizzard and they left out a bunch of stuff at the end and I'm like, but what about &lt;this&gt;, what about &lt;that&gt;, and what happened to &lt;whoever&gt;. Blizzard just pats me on the head, smiles and puts the book away.</div></div><hr />

I'm sorry... but no. WoD has been such an abysmal failure for me simply because I don't raid.

There was just nothing to do outside of LFR and garrison missions (that interest me!).</div></div><hr />

They completely missed the point of player owned housing and everything about garrisons was either an obligation in order to raid or a profession gate, and none of the interesting buildings (like the engineering place) got taken because of all those obligations. Garrisons simply because a vacant log out point, where you just go from there to a raid instance and back. I don't even do most of my work orders these days. Now blizzard revealed that followers would be irrelevant in the next patch? Seriously? After I've spent so many resources getting their item levels up, and getting a legendary follower, all just to scrap them all and restart the entire process with boats?<br />
<br />
Hands down the least fun xpac for me so far. I don't do anything besides mythic raiding and the occasional garrison mission for a small chance at raid gear. If I weren't in a mythic raiding guild I probably wouldn't be playing anymore, and I assume this is the same kind of situation for many players; staying for the people and friends and not for the game.</div></div><hr />

No nerfs incoming either.<br />
<br />
And mount... just reskins every single time, AND they costs insane amounts of gold and crystals. Blizzard has just become really really lazy. Just take a look at conquest gear. It looks like leveling gear! Terrible.</div></div><hr />

TBH, this is what I take away from the curve. The 10 mil subs at the end of Q1 was the outlier, else we're pretty much right where we were most of MoP.<br />
<br />
What I'd be really interested to see is regional sub numbers. The presentation implied that there was a loss in the East, and that the price increases there were to cover it. <br />

<br />
Raiding is as good as it has ever been - but PvE content outside of raiding is possibly in the worst state it ever has been. I didn't want dailies, but there's nothing compelling there to replace them. Apexis quests are dailies without a real end goal even though some raid gear can be acquired from it. A real, traditional reputation grind or three wouldn't have gone amiss so long as no raid gear was hidden behind them, and instead toys and mounts were the focus. Garrisons should *not* have been central to the WoD experience. Professions got gutted and REKT.<br />
<br />
There really needs to be more PvP content - Ashran is an unmitigated failure and a total disaster zone. <br />
<br />
Class balance in PvE and PvP is further adrift than I can ever remember. <br />
<br />
I didn't think that the subs would drop by so many, so quickly, though. People really are voting with their wallets.</div></div><hr />

Are there things I would like to change? yes. I don't mind garrisons, but not as the focal point of my game. It has a purpose and it serves me well. <br />

Tokens aren't counted in the report because the report end date was before token release. If 6.2 comes out in June we can probably expect an increase again with the tokens and new content in the same quarter. Worst case is that it probably remains stable at ~7ish.

Maybe WoD was better than Cata, and that is a long stretch. Vashj'ir was a more interesting leveling zone than all WoD zones combined. But no WoD is not better than MoP. MoP was a lot better than a lot of people claim. Just a bunch of &quot;lol kung-fu panda!&quot; trolls.</div></div><hr />

WOD is an expansion but based around a series of Cuts. They focused so much on Garrisons just Generic features that don't offer that much in originality <br />

Yeah. Certainly. Of course. Topkek m9.<br />

It's sad. Even with this large drop of subs, which I'm glad about. Not because I want to see this game die, but because I want Blizzard to open their god damn fucking eyes.

<br />
Garrisoncraft just wasn't doing it for me, and there was no casual-friendly endgame content, like daily quest hubs, and leveling a new character felt like a complete chore, not to mention how prohibitively restricted crafting is/was, where you can't even do any crafting at all without going halfway into the first zone's quests and then building up a garrison and waiting for stuff to level up so you can FINALLY start making anything relevant.<br />
<br />
I thought Sunsong Ranch was bad, but once they gave us the BoA rep tokens, it wasn't that bad as you could go from never having touched the farm to full output within a week, only doing 10-15min a day.<br />
<br />
And now they're adding vendor-bought 645 equipment tokens.... at 500 gold each. Seriously? Do they expect me to dump 20,000 gold on each character to get their followers up to 645? hahaha, no. They should have just made the Goredrenched weaponry BoA.</div></div><hr />

Losing that many subscribers would sink other games, but WoW manages to stay afloat and still reel in considerable income.<br />
<br />
Saying it &quot;deserves&quot; this is petty. People seem to take the state of the game too personal. If you've quit the game, you shouldn't be so emotionally invested that you jump for joy when people quit. It's a bit depressing.<br />
<br />
I can get what you're saying to a degree, but look at it this way.<br />
<br />
A lot of people have played this game since they were kids, myself included, I was maybe 14-15 when I started back in BC, and all of us invested YEARS into the game because we enjoyed it. However, some of us just feel bitter about the state of the game we once cherished and are either A: Want to see some drastic changes brought back or B: See the game crash and burn (For those sadistic type of people.)<br />
<br />
Personally, I feel just a bit happy at the loss, they might get income from the game, but nowhere near what they were getting. Which is why I hope they can start changing things cause this whole expansion is just a Nostalgia PoS trip that failed.</div></div><hr />

And that was the longest dry spell of no new content since WotLK! The whole garrison idea has to be the problem. I let my account go 2 months ago, because i was so damn bored. There was just nothing to do outside of LFR and garrison missions (that interest me!).<br />
<br />
Actually, those subs were up because of people paying for one month to get their free chopper.</div></div><hr />

People just sit in their garrisons and do their dailies but if you don't raid then you don't really have to communicate, well raids or arenas. A lot of guilds are really quiet, big guilds, small guilds, any size really. Nothing to do together, it used to be fun to meet new people all the time but now people rarely speak when grouping either. Its just join group &quot;thx bye&quot; and leave group. I'm not very into the garrison to be honest, I would have liked a guild garrison more, team effort yeeey! It's nice and all to have your little place but not enough customization to make it interesting or to make it feel like home. You're all alone in your little town. Aaaaall alone. <br />
<br />
What would help? I don't know. World events? Does new content really have to be dungeons or raids?<br />
<br />
Yes I'm a casual, but so are a lot of others. The ones with nothing to do and quitting WoW because they don't want to raid either. I had most fun in wotlk.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I know for example a lot of battlefield players went to GTA, the new Battlefield Hardline is dead on PC now and that happend right after GTA V Launch.<br />
To be said, there is a lot better games on the market at the moment and keeping such an old game updated is hard. They're trying really hard but they are trying in the wrong way. <br />
They trying to add more stuffs that can bring in MONEY instead of TRUE content and fun stuffs that will bring in more players and they can still get the same income without all these tons of crap stuffs they're adding for money.<br />
<br />
Well that's my opinion and after quited like 2 months ago myself i don't regreat it. Blizzard needs a wake up shower before it's to late.</div></div><hr />

coming back to BETA feedback all the issues raised after launch they knew months prior to launch and dismissed all concerns.<br />
They knew what was best for the Game everyone else was talking rubbish. Along come WOW tokens but they still don't accept unless you put the fun<br />
back into the Game who's going to bother wasting gold on the tokens?<br />

bet they come out with some excuse about Stat Squish etc instead of actually admitting they need a full review how each class plays</div></div><hr />

However, this quarter ended in March, and tokens didn't start till April.<br />

I'm one of those sub losses, my account expired March 25th. I'm now however, active until next January (what ELSE am I going to spend 10 years worth of gold on :D)</div></div><hr />

It just isn't the case.<br />

I think the argument is that some people quit in anticipation of the WoW Token before the WoW Token launched. The token launched in April, which isn't in Q1, so those subs wouldn't be counted.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The little things in game already tell you of the massive fall in players.<br />
<br />
1) The AFK timer that kicks you out of the server, during launch, I couldn't go to the kitchen to grab something to eat without getting kicked off. Now I can go downstairs, browse the shops for snacks and take my time and still be online.<br />
<br />
2) Number of people in Warspear/Orgrimmar, its virtually empty.<br />
<br />
3) When I go farm timber, I hardly bump in to anyone, pretty sad really.<br />
<br />
And like I said, farmville doesnt last very long, or in this case, Garrison.<br />
<br />
I was bored, i quit, then i came back because it is now a habit. WOW isnt fun, its boring, but its a habit, like I need to login ever so often for my fix, then quit again.</div></div><hr />

Anyway:<br />
<br />
http://www.quickmba.com/images/marketing/product/lifecycle/plc.gif<br />
<br />
Pretty clear where we are here. They certainly did their best to make WOTLK the peak by stripping the world of people with the dungeon finder, a year and a half of no content, and a shit followup.<br />
<br />
I feel ripped off by WOD and wish I could get even a partial refund. 25% price increase was NOT justified.<br />
<br />
<br />
Just like Game Time Cards, Tokens are not calculated into the total amount of subs.<br />
<br />
the 7.1 million are those who are signed up for the $15/mo reoccurring payment or those who have paid for many months in advance. GameTime Cards and Tokens are not reflected.<br />
<br />
<br />
That said: 7.1 million is still a lot, game is not dying this is an expected loss as always happens as an expansion goes and people get bored of the new and shiny. Next expansion will come out....subs will spike up to 10mil again for a few months....lather, rinse, repeat.</div></div><hr />

<br />
BRING BACK 10-MAN RAIDING!!, I know of at least 150 players spanning 15 guilds that would return in a heart beat and play again even this shitty content if it was in a 10-player environment, 20-man raiding killed a lot of guilds and separated many friendships, guilds with massive progress almost near the end of this 1st tier 9/10 Mythic and they quit, not even split up just outright quit because for them the game will never be the same playing without friends and having to struggle with 20 strangers and drama that comes along with it.<br />
<br />
I speak from experience from being a 10-year subscriber who was the GM of a 10-year old raiding guild we split and quit and myself and a few others who are hanging on to a fine thread is about to break that thread soon also if the game dont change, the reality is games only last when you play with friends and wow lasted for so long because it established that ground, WOD broke that very sacred thing it was built on which is friends playing together and with options to scale bigger or stay small but still enjoy competitive play and not be discriminated for it because you opted to do 10-man raid, flex mode does not make one feel equal nor it should to any raid size, though its a very nice feature to gear up for content it should not be considered sufficient for organized groups who cant get 20-players to raid or want to stay with 10.<br />
<br />
I have so many Ideas on how to keep the game relevant as Im sure the other 7.1 Million subscribers do also, I hope Blizzard reads this one day and makes a choice to reunite the subs and friends they lost by bringing back 10-man raids and 10-man flex mode Dungeons to gear up raid groups together for 10-man raids etc, you can email me blizzard for this 10 million subscriber Idea :).<br />
<br />
Hopefully something is done quick before we all quit for another game and comeback in 3 years when WOW is relevant again.<br />

There's never been a period of 18 months (i.e., a year and a half) where there's been no new raid tier or new other content. The closest was the 14 months of Siege, which is still quite a ways short of a year and a half. You don't have to exaggerate to make it sound serious when 14 months is already rather serious.<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
<br />
It mostly spiked up to those who wanted to try it and dropped back down to where it was at the end of MoP. (not counting the returners of mop for the 6.0 patch) Most of the players who left during mop already had a sour taste in their mouth so its no suprise that they came back to try WoD for a bit and then leave as they are were already more inclined to not play anymore. <br />
<br />
Also One thing that has a pretty negative impact is that the ones who enjoy the game are much less vocal where as the people who are extra whiney are the ones new players hear the most. I had friends not want to resub because of the whinning on the forums. Personally i resubbed for WoD and am finding it satisfying and keeping me occupied. <br />
<br />
Am i dissapointed that they couldnt rekindle the flame in those that had left? Yes, but it really hasnt made a net change since the end of MoP. Its still going to continuously drop for a long time to come simply because of the titles age. I kinda want to say its time to end WoW and bring it into a new era and continue the storyline in WoW 2 with a rebuilt interface and system now that they know the scale of playerbase in their game. Id say that Blizzard will probably be happy if it settles around the same sub numbers as ff14 (4-5mil). A sub of 4-5 mil is still a large enough income to have a fully developed staff for the game.</div></div><hr />

Gotta love those...... Blizzard enthusiasts:<br />
&quot;Subscriber Definition: World of Warcraft subscribers include individuals who have paid a subscription fee or have an active prepaid card to play World of Warcraft, as well as those who have purchased the game and are within their free month of access. Internet Game Room players who have accessed the game over the last thirty days are also counted as subscribers. The above definition excludes all players under free promotional subscriptions, expired or cancelled subscriptions, and expired prepaid cards. Subscribers in licensees' territories are defined along the same rules.&quot;<br />
<br />
You can find the difinition of &quot;subs&quot; here, by the company Blizzard-Activision THEMSELVES: <br />

<br />
If you have no clue at all, better don't say anything. <br />
Besides: this is the Q1 earnings-call. Token were introduced in Q2. And i don't know what is over there in NA but in Europe there is hardly any token there to purchase because nobody in their right minds will fork over 20 bucks for a lousy 40k gold (in the EU), not talking about an even lousier 20K gold.</div></div><hr />

Updated character models were sloppy and not all of them were in at launch. They had to slowly update them after release. Karabor and the horde equivalent cities were never implemented and they could have been awesome. Ashran was a huge fail; no part of it is even close to being something I'd call &quot;fun.&quot; Garrisons quickly became repitive and it this point feel like a chore. Having no dailies helped contribute to the &quot;nothing to do feeling.&quot; As well as the new faction reputations had nothing worth working towards- just a bland mount and useless gear (by the time you acquire enough of the currency you already have much better gear). The levelling content was phenomenal and the zones look great, but there's only so many times you want to level an alt through Draenor. Overall I am happy with this expansion, but I can see why people are leaving. Oh and also the 6.1 &quot;content patch&quot; was garbage.</div></div><hr />

6.) Stop trying to make everything like Timeless Isle (better yet, get rid of that design philosophy entirely). Timeless Isle sucks and is McDonalds level content. There's no story, no purpose, no progression, just things to kill and loot for no reason.<br />

<br />
It's doom and gloom. The sky isn't falling. The game isn't suddenly on the fast track to death.<br />
<br />
The subs will perk up when the next tier of content comes out... then they'll dip back down when people finish that content... then they'll perk back up when the next expansion is released... then they'll dip back down once people finish that content... and so on.<br />
<br />
Blizzard could release the ultimate expansion with thirty new dungeons, five raid tiers, mountains of PvP content, and several maximum level zones... and the subs would drop after the first two quarters.</div></div><hr />

Something that doesn't get lost in a pile of steamy breaths and being trapped in a cube of jello. Proper character customization would be awesome. Or mount customization options. Like making the mount glow or spectral etc. Not just 5 minute things or achievements. That kinda stuff would really warm my heart and cause me to play to get all that much more than getting toys.

<br />
Instead of making a game &quot;everyone&quot; would enjoy. Blizzard needs to focus back on the genre niche. Stepping away from the Class Quests, Ulduar style instances, daily quests, group quests, and AV style BGs has been honest steps back.<br />
<br />
Fuck the casuals and make the game more group based again. Stop the realm transfers and name changes, unless honest harassment is being had. We can keep all of these new features like, Garrisons, LFG, LFR, challenge modes, 20 mans, and still have all of the things Blizzard has cut or made irrelevant.</div></div><hr />

As mostly a PvP player and disc priest, I completely hated what PvP as a healer was now. You just sit in endless CC, and from what I heard they removed instants (prayer of mending my fav spell in the game, ruined with a cast time). If you're not in CC, any dps class now has an interrupt so you have to juke endlessly. Honestly I don't think they could of done a worse job in this area.<br />
They should just remove interrupts but lower the damage / healing. Same end result but you cast spells.<br />
<br />
Garrisons were fun for a while, but when you max most of your followers you ain't got stuff to do anymore. Also people stopped hanging around in cities, orgrimmar was mostly dead except for the dueling area. Great way to remove the social element out of the game. Was also able to make good money in wotlk with transmuting gems, now there's barely any gems and no transmutation of them whatsoever, ruined my favorite profession. Was subbed for 3 months and all I did was level up characters and do some raids for transmog gear. I tried investing time in PvE but I was just finishing university and I didn't wanna commit to anything<br />
<br />
Anyway I'm kinda glad that WoW is dying and I kinda hoped it to have died by now, I wanna try other mmo's without going &quot;well is it gonna be as good then WoW to keep people interested enough to have a large enough community? Or is it gonna merge servers after 2 months&quot;</div></div><hr />

You know that &quot;casuals&quot; are the majority of their customers? Let me give you a hint: the most successful product of Activision Blizzard is *drums* SKYLANDERS. And stop talking about WOW as it was the uber-hardcore-pro-niche-mmo-game, WOW is, was and always has been the most casual MMO out there, and that is the number one reason WHY it got so successful: accessibility. Mythic raiding is only a drip in the bucket as it only for around 5% of the total player base of WOW.</div></div><hr />

Seriously, that is what I think to. I originally loved the idea of Garrisons and follower missions because I thought they were going to be an add-on to gameplay, similar to how I liked pet battles.. But this is different.. Garrisions ARE the expansion.. there is very little else to do and the entire system feels so gated and maintainency.. there is nothing dynamic about it.. The game is just so controlled right now.. everything is so micromanaged to the point there it is predictable and plotable, which takes away any feeling of adventure.</div></div><hr />

The sub numbers have been in a steady decline, up until shortly before WoD, pretty much with the pre-expansion patch all the way down to 6.8 mio.<br />
Then there was a huge (and unexpected) hike up to 10 mio. Now it's falling back down into the old trend with still and for now being 0.3 mio above the all time low.</div></div><hr />

Guessing next drop will be small because of tokens and 6.2. 6.8M. 5M expansion low. Next expansion brings subs to 7-8m. Wows still got 10 more years of profitability behind it, but I'm doubtful it has years of good content left in it. If 7.0 disappoints i may just quit for good.</div></div><hr />

For the first time I'm not upset to see such a sharp drop, though, since I think every bit of incentive the devs are given to rethink their current design goals is one step closer to getting the game back on track with a lot of the awesome systems we had in Pandaria.</div></div><hr />

Like that quest hub they talked about, or the accessories they mentioned such as Librams, Quivers etc.<br />
<br />
they'd have brought back librams?</div></div><hr />

Their resourcers can be better utilized in other projects, while the bare minimum goes to WoW. That's why there's so little content, why we get got an unfinished expansion. They are trying to give us enough so most people keep playing. <br />
<br />
I guess this explains why they did the token. It helps with revenue, and it will help to keep the numbers from dropping without using too many resourcers.</div></div><hr />

It's a lot more than casuals who quit. I played quite a bit before giving up on the garbage Blizz sold us.</div></div><hr />

This makes it seem like that was nothing. 3mil, damn. Basically 1 in 3 players quit.<br />
<br />
And it is bad. People always act like &quot;wow will survive with only a million subs&quot;. Will it survive? Maybe. But Blizzard is part of a company that takes part in stock exchange, &quot;just surviving&quot; is not an option.... like AT ALL. Products HAVE to make a gain in profit quarter to quarter. Will it ever hit 1 mio. Subs? NO, definatly not. In fact with such a huge drop in subs and the numbers down to 7.1 mio. subs it is getting pretty close to the number where &quot;subs&quot; are not the most profitable option for the company.<br />
<br />
If nothing changes drastically Q2 will look worse: People paid for tokens to sell for gold might have spend all that gold and when they leave there are the token-for-gold-buyers which have plenty of playtime, but it was paid already. So going to Q3.... you do the mass. <br />
Blizzard needs to make up for the losses, and they do =&gt; &quot;hearthstone&quot; and &quot;heros of the storm&quot; less financial effort to produce content than producing one for an MMO and higher profit. Blizzard will do fine after all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The doom and gloom folks have escaped again; better round them up and put them back into their cage.<br />
<br />
yup, because losing ~1/3rd of the subs in 3 months isn't bad.</div></div><hr />

But of all the people I've played with over the years, I am essentially the only one left.. And that's been quite a bunch. And while everyone I talk to has slightly different reasons mentioned. But one reason was mentioned by all of them regarding game play.....<br />
They're sick about the constant overhaul of the classes and specs.<br />
And that criticism I share with them.. <br />
Why Blizzard thinks that they constantly have to reinvent the wheel and make classes different again and again, that makes no sense.<br />
Another talent tree.. Another set of ability changes, another set of spell removal change.. <br />
It's counter productive to the identification factor.</div></div><hr />

This was the first expansion I had beta access to and I could not believe how paper-thin the content was. I predicted (as stated on here many times) that this was going to rip the game apart and look, it has happened. Cataclysm was better for me than last 2 expansions but it was the start of a worrying line of focus for the game. I really thought Blizzard were going to come back for this expansion and give the real fans an amazing game again but the focus has changed: the movie is everything but they are not backing up the Warcraft Universe with an apt game to put a solid light on the franchise. Surely they will capitalise commercially on the movie? What if the product stinks? This is not overnight news for them, they do not wake up and see these figures, they know them well. What will they do? Hand the game back, the real game, to those that love it? Let's hope so. I am worried about focus on their free games. That's bringing in the real money now, well what about Wow Blizzard? What about the veterans too, what is for them to play in this game?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">papajohn4</div><div class="date">2015-05-06, 09:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">and seeing 6.2 patch it seems they did not got the message...they continue in the same philosophy, it seems they think that wow tokens will save the situation, but only for a while..</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Delaios</div><div class="date">2015-05-06, 09:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah dailies got blamed hardcore but the issue was never dailies themselves, merely the mandatory rewards and currency vendors gated behind them. WoD's faction reward system was great but the faction felt lifeless and were just straight mob grinds. Dailies + cosmetic focused rewards would have been perfect.<br />
<br />
Factions can reward gear just fine and they've been doing that since BC. Where MoP went wrong was:<br />
- making rep gear cost valor<br />
- making the only source for rep dailies<br />
- making the only source for roll tokens dailies<br />
<br />
I think you are the first person I've heard saying that WoD factions have a good reward system. A tabard, re-textured mounts, re-textured pets, an overly expensive follower, a forgettable toy and a useless trinket do not make for good rewards. WoD is tied with Classic for winner of the most terrible factions.</div></div><hr />

Guess we won't see a 3rd raid tier now lol......they gotta push the next expansion to regain some of the subs at least temporarily.....incoming next expansion Q1 lol.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arkura</div><div class="date">2015-05-06, 09:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is what happens when they spend over 6 months with getting more content. <br />
Black Rock Foundry is still the first tier of this expansion so I wouldnt say thats &quot;new&quot; content. Its in the first tier of the expansion. <br />
Over 6 months before a new season just because they try to live up to a &quot;1 year new expansion&quot; resolution wich we can see now that wont happen by checking out patch notes :P <br />
<br />
<br />
Nice going, you replaced and made your staff so much bigger, but never stopped thinking the same way about things.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mmoc1404d70bfa</div><div class="date">2015-05-06, 09:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I started with wow at age 14 i am now 21 and i have a lot of work to do now that takes up almost all my days, when i get home i rather sit and relax to a movie instead of login in to world of warcraft because finding a raid group or rbg teams takes up to much time and effort as you are exhausted after a day working and so on.<br />
<br />
What i am saying is that i agree and people with my age, we where those who played a lot and kept to wow for a long time. <br />
New players today has a lot more games to choose from when they are starting to play something and wow is a game way to old to compentense a lot of the others.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aori</div><div class="date">2015-05-06, 09:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Instead of making a game &quot;everyone&quot; would enjoy. Blizzard needs to focus back on the genre niche. Stepping away from the Class Quests, Ulduar style instances, daily quests, group quests, and AV style BGs has been honest steps back.<br />
<br />
Fuck the casuals and make the game more group based again. Stop the realm transfers and name changes, unless honest harassment is being had. We can keep all of these new features like, Garrisons, LFG, LFR, challenge modes, 20 mans, and still have all of the things Blizzard has cut or made irrelevant.<br />
<br />
You're joking about Ulduar right? We need more instances styled around it.</div></div><hr />
