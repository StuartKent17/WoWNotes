3/4<br />
In the Lord Marrowgar encounters, the boss will no longer reset threat after a bone storm and will now wait a small amount of time before attacking at the end of a bone storm.<br />
In the Deathbringer Saurfang encounters, the boss is now less likely to cast Blood Nova on targets affected by Mark of the Fallen Champion.<br />
In both normal and heroic versions of the 10 player Rotface encounter, the mutated infection ability will not be cast as quickly while the fight progresses.<br />
In the 10- and 25-player heroic Festergut encounters, the malleable goo ability should no longer target pets.<br />
In the Valithria Dreamwalker encounters, the duration of Emerald Vigor and Twisted Nightmares were slightly increased.<br />
In the Sindragosa encounters, the duration of the instability debuff was slightly reduced.<br />

Tank Threat Generation<br />
I'm talking philosophy here, because I assume that's usually more interesting to a wider audience. Philosophically, tank threat generation is working correctly (i.e. as we intend) with perhaps 4-5 exceptions that we would like to fix:<br />
<br />
1) Paladins can do a little too much AE tanking &quot;splash&quot; damage, often without even setting out to do so.<br />
2) Tricks and MD take too much of a burden off of the tank / hide issue #3.<br />
3) Damage and therefore threat generation aren't scaling well at very high levels of gear. &lt;-- this is the big one.<br />
4) There is too much incentive to AE every pull, which puts a burden on the tank to AE tank every pull.<br />
5) You could probably add that bears need a button to hit besides Swipe. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/23425588028-do-warriors-really-need-another-cleave.html))<br />
<br />
Overgearing instances<br />
Yeah, overgearing the content is fine. Being able to zerg an instance is one of the fun parts of overgearing. We're not worried about that. But on content at appropriate level, it wouldn't be so bad if *some* of the pulls required more crowd control and single-target damage.

Warriors AE Threat<br />
I don't think warriors need more sustained AE threat. You have Incite + Deep Wounds for Thunderclap and also Shockwave. Maintaining threat is supposed to take some effort. I don't think tanking would be any more fun if you hit Tclap and never had to hit a button again.<br />
<br />
The actual problem, in our minds, is threat scaling. Warriors (and all tanks) could AE tank just fine in Naxxramas.* It only became a problem over time when the dps of the dps classes grew so much more quickly than the tanks, largely because the dps classes have so many dps stats on their gear while plate tanks have Strength. Tank damage was pretty close to 50% of dps damage in the first tier of content, which was our goal, but has slipped to 25 to 30% of dps (your mileage may vary) in Icecrown.<br />
<br />
We need a system that keeps tank damage scaling at the same rate as dps damage. However, that system can't be dependent on gear stats (unless you're willing to see tank gear go away) and can't be as ridiculous as deep talents that say &quot;You get 5 AP per point of Strength.&quot;<br />
<br />
I think you just notice threat issues more on AE pulls because things like Tricks and Misdirect mask any problems on single target pulls. Separate problem.<br />
<br />
And yes Paladin tank AE damage and threat generation is still too high, largely because of Seals and HoR, but long-term we're going to nerf that instead of making all tanks able to trivially maintain threat in all situations. Referencing the other thread on threat a little, why as a tank would you even care what buttons you push if maintaining threat is a foregone conclusion?<br />
<br />
* - AE tanking was fine in Naxxramas. AE damage was, and has remained, over the top. We prefer a model where the risk of tanking too many mobs is that the tank dies, not that you can't maintain threat on them all (within reasonable limits of course). We also prefer a model where the dps do AE damage on some pulls and switch to single target dps on others.

Low FPS - NVIDIA 196.75 drivers<br />
We're getting reports where users are getting intermittent low FPS after installing these drivers. It seems that it is related to the fan control included in these drivers not working correctly and is causing the video card to overheat on 3D applications. This will affect Warcraft 3, World of Warcraft and StarCraft 2 Beta. Please uninstall the drivers and revert back to the older ones.<br />

well you should either lower the paladins ae threat or increase the warriors ae threat cause as it is atm when im tanking in icc on my warr and the other tank is a paladin and we have fairly the same gear, no matter what i do, i cant reach up to the same ammount of threat the paladin throws out, im hammering my buttons but still im miles away in threat like third on the list and its bin like this for a long time, no matter what i do i cant throw out the same ammount of threat to keep up, and iv bin tanking long before horde even go these bubbleclasses so i know what im doing, and still u say the warriors threat is as it should be?? even the dk's is passing us in threat output</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh really? A Paladin is doing more AoE threat than a Warrior on a batch of Undead mobs?<br />
<br />
Paladin AoE threat is built-up over the duration of Consecration outside of Icecrown, so Warriors are a lot better at burst threat for such situations as the whelps on Onyxia. Holy Wrath is the Paladin burst threat, but it only works on Undead.<br />
<br />
<br />
The change to Marrowgar is rather sad, to be honest. I thought they made him taunt-able because of the threat-reset. Now, I haven't done him on heroic mode, but I guess that this change is because a person with DoTs on the boss could be the unlucky target of the last spin and get smacked immediately after it ended.<br />
<br />
Deathbringer Saurfang fix is awesome, RNG is a bitch. Rotface nerf is rather sad, but I suppose it's needed for newer guilds(though the buff should help with that), but I guess it's less cleansing I need to do... oh, and once again, could have something to do with the heroic mode.</div></div><hr />

Go ahead and read the forumlinks written in the &quot;OP&quot;. People have had their card burn out because the drivercontrol of the fan was malfunctioning.<br />
There is a VERY good reason that Nvidia completely removed those drivers from their website. It's not because you could cut yourself on the sharp images.<br />

In short: Don't use those drivers, and if you already installed them - rollback to older versions like it's adviced by Blizzard and Nvidia.</div></div><hr />

Some of these changes have been around for a while apparently, during the latest PTR update I saw Blood Nova (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/72378/) getting a 16 sec cooldown and the duration of Emerald Vigor (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/70873/) was increased from 35 to 40 seconds. Instability (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/69766/)'s duration has been reduced from 8 to 5 seconds.<br />
<br />
It remind me the &quot;Wanna buy some try times on Algalon ?&quot;.. Current raid shouldn't be open in rush period to &quot;buy&quot; tries on each last boss of ICC, especially when the PTR isn't a content patch or at least in Heroic Mode.</div></div><hr />

You should read the whole post untill you understand what they are saying.<br />
<br />
I like how they think about tanking and getting CC back etc. AoEing heroics and raid trash is fun for the first times but after that it's really boring. Liked how you had to CC SSC and TK trash much more. You die if you tank 3 of those mobs so you have to CC 1 or 2.<br />
In ICC if we pull 3 groups in the first room we actually survive without any CC. That ain't right ;p.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They change Misdirect so that it lasts for more then 3 shots and actually work like advertised. Then later they say that they wont tanks to be dependant on misdirect/tricks for single target threat; which they really dont, but hunters/rogues use them so that dps doesnt have the 3 sunders wait period (ooh the good old days).<br />
<br />
Once any tank worth their salt has a boss on them they should never lose them to anyone; I've seen tanks go as high as 10k tps, no dps class currently in game that can match that and not have a dependable reusable aggro dump.</div></div><hr />

Change that AD note to &quot;absorbs up to 30% of your maximum health, lasts 20 seconds&quot; and it'd be good actually. As long as it doesn't state &quot;you will not die&quot; anymore.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sulika</div><div class="date">2010-03-05, 09:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh really? A Paladin is doing more AoE threat than a Warrior on a batch of Undead mobs?<br />
<br />
Paladin AoE threat is built-up over the duration of Consecration outside of Icecrown, so Warriors are a lot better at burst threat for such situations as the whelps on Onyxia. Holy Wrath is the Paladin burst threat, but it only works on Undead.<br />
<br />
<br />
The change to Marrowgar is rather sad, to be honest. I thought they made him taunt-able because of the threat-reset. Now, I haven't done him on heroic mode, but I guess that this change is because a person with DoTs on the boss could be the unlucky target of the last spin and get smacked immediately after it ended.<br />
<br />
Deathbringer Saurfang fix is awesome, RNG is a bitch. Rotface nerf is rather sad, but I suppose it's needed for newer guilds(though the buff should help with that), but I guess it's less cleansing I need to do... oh, and once again, could have something to do with the heroic mode.<br />
<br />
<br />
Spoken like someone who has never tried to tank the onyxia whelps as a warrior. The onyxia whelps spawn in a long line over 5-10 seconds. This is a nightmare for a warrior tank because once you use thunderclap to aggro the first bunch the next bunch all fly right past you while it is still on cooldown. This means you have to use your shockwave for initial aggro on some before using your thunderclap (when it comes off of cooldown) for initial aggro on the last few. The problem this creates is that you have wildly variable threat on the whelps. Some will have only gotten hit by a single thunderclap and will get overaggrod again almost immediately when the DPS start to AoE. Combined with the way warrior threat for the most part just doesn't scale up to large numbers of adds and you have issues. A paladin or DK on the other hand can just put down consecration or DnD at the cave entrance and all the mobs aggro on him/her the moment they leave the cave.<br />
<br />
A warrior certainly can tank onyxia whelps but your post betrays a severe lack of understanding of how warrior tanking mechanics work in practice. To an uneducated non-warrior you might easily look at shockwave and think &quot;omg, warrior can just shockwave all the whelps and have great burst threat on them all&quot; but its small, directional AoE combined with the encounter mechanics makes that impossible.<br />
<br />
I think however that reflected damage (holy shield, thorns, retribution aura, fire shield, damage shield) are in many way the culprits on AoE tanking balance. They turn small threat advantages into large ones. If the paladin gets initial aggro then he gets extra threat from all that reflected damage while also denying the warrior the same threat. If as a warrior you get even a small headstart on threat this is enough to keep the mobs hitting you quite consistently. In general reflected damage is a magnifying effect on tank AoE threat since it makes small differences much more pronounced. The threat you get from reflection should be removed and added into each classes baseline abilities (i.e. increase thunderclap damage by an amount equal to two blocks worth of reflected damage and remove damage shield as a talent). Take a situation now where a paladin generates 1 more threat than the warrior on an AoE pull from abilities. This makes all the mobs hit him, proccing retribution aura, holy shield, fire shield and thorns every time they hit him. His 1 threat advantage is now a 1k TPS advantage because of all the reflected damage. Similarly if the warrior has a 1 threat advantage a similar thing happens, all the reflected damage turns that tiny advantage into a huge one. <br />
<br />
A tank with all those reflected shields up does a huge amount of extra damage and threat to the point that once a mob is hitting you, no matter what class you are, it is almost impossible to get overaggrod by another tanks AoE threat. Reflected damage works fine as a tank DPS mechanic, as a tank TPS mechanic however it has a lot of negative impact on AoE tanking.<br />
<br />
I do also think however that a lot of warriors are overstating how hard warriors have it on AoE threat, in Icecrown I notice no huge difference as a warrior tanking with a paladin vs a DK tanking with a paladin. Trying to solo tank it as a warrior however is vastly easier than solo tanking it as a DK (on rep farm runs for example). As a DK you cast death and decay, ps, it, pestillence and 3 seconds later your diseases start ticking on the mobs you pestillenced. That means for the first 6 seconds of each pull the only AoE threat you have is Death and Decay. It is very easy to get overaggrod in this time and almost impossible to recover from as a DK. As a warrior you have great opening burst threat on each pull and, lets be honest, most of the pulls in ICC are 4-6 mobs which is still small enough groups that warrior AoE threat continues to work pretty well. <br />
<br />
Going further to the broader idea of needing CC on trash packs the main problem is that CC as a whole interacts really badly with all tanks AoE threat and with offspecs as they are it is never going to be viable to return to CC in raid instances anyway. On any trash where CC was going to be needed it will just be easier to have one or two DPS spec to tank and use 4 or 5 tanks all spamming AoE threat as opposed to 2 or 3 plus CC. On my guilds 25 man runs for example we usually have 3 tanks and another 3 or 4 people who could go tank with their offspec easily. Why would we ever bother with the hassle of CC where just using an extra 2 or 3 or 4 tanks is just as easy and probably faster overall. The only way to prevent this is to have specific mechanics that require CC but if you have to do that then the CC is being used because of the mechanic that forces you to CC as opposed to tanks just not being able to take the incoming damage.</div></div><hr />

Could be true but your healers also need to keep up with the damage. And you lose dps from the people who respec. It just depends on how they change tanking and healing.<br />
<br />
For example the trash in Fel Reavers room. You couldn't just add a few tanks and AoE it. It would be unhealable and the engineers (or whatever those mobs were called) would repair the other mobs. It was hard trash, not like it is now.<br />
Or the trash before Kael'thas his room. They hit like trucks. I wouldn't take a risk there and not CC really.</div></div><hr />

The problem on the Void Reaver (Fel Reaver, shame on you :) ) trash was the blades the mechanics used to cast which would do huge raid damage if you left them all up at once. This is not CC due to tank damage, it is CC because there is damage that kills the raid if not used. Like I said, they can always require you to CC by making an encounter mechanic that requires it, but the days when people used CC because if they didn't the tanks would take too much damage are gone.</div></div><hr />

What a Paladin does or do not do has no bearing on a Warrior. In other words, you do NOT need to nerf one to buff the other.<br />
<br />
As for Paladin tanking I have noticed these two issues with regards to AOE:<br />
1. I must use AOE abilities to deal single target threat.<br />
2. AOE (5+ mobs) threat is low, if constant, and easily overaggroed unless it is undead mobs.<br />
<br />
A &quot;fix&quot; could simply be splitting Hammer of Righteousness into two abilities - one with no target cap but say 20-30% lower damage and one with a target cap of 1.<br />
<br />
Or simply reduce all tanks AOE threat to a point where CC is once again required. I loved raiding TBC.<br />
<br />
Unrelated to the current topic: which DK need more threat on Icy Touch? Maybe Unholy, but the other two specs being unable to pull enough threat is a matter of laziness (or having forgotten to make ALL abilities into macros starting with &quot;/cast !Rune Strike&quot; - which is a requirement to tank as DK even before crit immune)</div></div><hr />

Imagine those dudes with a 80% shadowbolt in OK, the rogues that stun you in HoR or those mobs that lower your armor in HoL.<br />

warrior tanks are fine, ive recently tested a friends prot paladin, and they are just spoiled like hell.<br />
there is nothing wrong with warrior AoE tanking, its just that other tanking classes, Paladins and DKs have a much easier time keeping AoE threat.<br />

I agree, this is a boring fight for tanks. I personally didn't like that they made him tauntable, and Tuesday we noticed no aggro reset. So now all we do is strafe left and right /yawn.<br />

And all you warriors out there complaining about pally AD must have forgotten about the cd's you have that pallies dont have such as shield wall and last stand. Warriors do not need to have the same AE threat or dmg as a pally. tanks are supposed to be unique the same as dps and healers. Thats why raid leaders have to choose which tanks they want for each specific encounter. If tanks all want to be the same then i want my boomkin to be the same as all other casters, give me a blink and a fear gosh darn it. =)</div></div><hr />

I find it hilarious for Blizzard to think that tank damage is too low. That's the whole idea of a tank - TO HAVE LOW DAMAGE. Lower dps even more but increase threat modifiers is my suggestion.<br />

I think you are missing their point. It doesn't scale so at top end raiding their DPS isn't scaling like others. It has nothing to do with leveling</div></div><hr />

I just set the fan speed to locked at 75%(default is 30% at 0% load - up to 100% if needed. Apparently the new drivers forgot that part). Mostly did this because of overheating problems with crysis. Careful with Rivatuner tho, it has a lot of overclocking stuff that can mess your card up if you don't know what your doing.(i don't mess with overclocking features at all) Running the latest drivers for windows7 64bit Gefoce260GTX and my frame rate is just fine.

You can't pull 8 mobs and have a massive amount of threat right away (as opposed to DK's with BB and D&amp;D, warrior's with TC and SW, druid's swipe, including AoE taunt for druids and warriors). Consecration starts to tick only in and every 2 seconds -- that's more than enough for a mob to aggro on a warlock doing seeds, leave the consecration area and lose all threat. Of course, if it's just 1 mob, you can taunt. But what if it's 3 or 4 mobs and they all go after different targets? Righteous Defense only hits 3 mobs and only if they attack the same target. Prot paladin is the only tanking class that can't do zerg-threat and doesn't have an AoE-taunt. <br />
<br />
If they tune down AoE threat, then they should give paladins a right-away-AoE-threat ability. Because it's getting ridiculously harder to tank 5-man instances than ICC -- mobs die before you have a chance to use even half of your abilities. If they make Consecration to have a first tick the moment you use it and then tick every 3 sec (up from 2 sec) -- I'm all for it.<br />

Glyphed hammer isn't enough AoE threat for you? Maybe Avenger's shield? The reflective damage from Holy Shield isn't enough? Paladins are in no way in a bad place for AoE threat. If you're having trouble holding or getting aggro as a Pally, AoE or otherwise, you're bad.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Example: *Defensive Stance threat is increased by % of your AP/Str* instead of just a set amount. I guess I'm just not a big fan of only having certain attacks have high threat values (referring to Icy Touch change)<br />
<br />
I think it's a problem with Tank gear not scaling as well as DPS gear does. I don't mind seeing some of my fellow DPS pulling 10,000-13,000 TPS (threat per second :P ) but its just a bummer how tanks have to rely on Tricks or Misdirection on a good amount of situations<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DrgnDancer</div><div class="date">2010-03-05, 07:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">People seem to not understand the tank scaling problem. It's not that tanks don't do enough DPS, per se, it's that the mechanic is designed for them to do a certain multiplier less than a DPS, but they're getting closer and closer to falling short of that multiplier. I'm going to pull some numbers out of my ass to demonstrate. These are not the real numbers, but they demonstrate the real point:<br />
<br />
Let's say that we have a Rogue DPS and a Warrior tank. When all is said and done, with TPS reduction and aggro shedding abilities, the Rogue does approximately 65% of his DPS as TPS. That is, for every 1K of damage he does, he gets 650 threat. The Warrior, between high threat abilities and TPS enhancement does 175% of his DPS as threat. So for every 1K of damage he gets 1750 threat. We're all in Naxx. The Rogue does 3K DPS and the Warrior does 1.5K DPS. Rogue is doing 1950 TPS and Warrior is doing 2625 TPS. The tank is comfortably ahead on threat, so no problem.<br />
<br />
Now a year later we're in all 251-277 ilvl gear. Most of the Rogue's upgrades have been tailored to increasing his DPS a lot, and his survivability a bit. Most of the tank's upgrades have been focused on upping his survivability a lot, and his DPS a bit. Now the Rogue is doing 10K DPS and the Warrior 3.5K DPS. Since the TPS ratios haven't changed, the Rogue is now doing 6500 TPS, but the Warrior is only doing 6126 TPS. Now the warrior is having threat problems. They're even worse if the Rogue out gears the Warrior for some reason. They might be masked if the Rogue uses Tricks a lot, and masked even more if there's more than one Rogue/Hunter using MD/Tricks, but the margins remain a lot thinner than they were in Naxx. <br />
<br />
I don't think the real numbers are quite this cut and dry, but this describes the basics of the problem. Simply upping the tanks threat coefficient would solve the problem in the short term (Tanks now do 200% of DPS as TPS, tank now does 7K TPS on his 3.5K DPS and is winning on threat again), but it really just masks the real problem. Eventually, because of the way gear scales, the DPS will catch up again, and Blizz will have to apply another &quot;fix&quot;. <br />
<br />
A person above me recommends increasing the the threat coefficient based on Str, but that kinda screws Druids, and is eventually still going to fall behind. Strength on tank gear still doesn't scale with all the DPS increasers on DPS gear. A more perfect solution might be a threat modifier that scales with the abilities tanks look for. Either Armor or Stamina would probably be best. Just stick a talent in the various tank trees that does something like &quot;Total threat is increased by x% for every y points in [Stamina, Armor, dodge, Whatever works].&quot; This solution has problems too, but I think it'll scale for a good long time before it becomes a problem</div></div><hr />

I mean, my guild is never going to be able to do either heroic, but I am ok with this because we can make it through the normal versions and at least we get to experience the content and encounters and have the chance to get some decent gear, not as good as the gear available in heroic, but that is as it should be.<br />

I think your English is bad. Read what I said again, pls. With dictionary.<br />
Glyphed hammer is 4 targets, AS only 3 targets. And you can't choose which mobs they hit. What if there are 8 mobs? You need to block a mob's attack for HS to proc. If they already attack you for you to block (which has only 25-30% chance, btw), then they are already on you and your aggro builds up. I'm talking about situations where mobs haven't even had a chance to get to you and hit you and already being aggroed by some ranged dps.</div></div><hr />

I've had this thought as well. Wrath killed CC hard, Blizz did that on purpose. If they think they can rez it they're nuts, people will scream such bloody murder it'd rend the heavens. At this point the best they can do is put in a pack or two and say &quot;See, if you CCed these mobs it'd be easier!&quot; and then watch as people steamroll over them. <br />

It's too bad, really, but dumbing a game down is pretty much a one-way street, even more so when you gleefully lobotomize it.

But the the problem lies in fact that we paladins use our aoe abillitys for single target THREAT aswell as aoe packs. <br />
<br />
That brings us to the conclusion that if you nerf our aoe threat you will nerf our single target threat. <br />
Our aoe threat has always been quite above the average for THIS reason because we use the same abillitys, wich makes our single target threat slightly reduced than other tanks with the same gear. For quite long we have had extra bonus passive threat on righteous fury, but it has been reduced in previous patches to bring us along with other tanks and now you tell us that warriors threat needs to be higher? when we scale quite the same, druids being slightly above?<br />
<br />
I feel it quite unnecessary. If you want to buff warriors threat, fine but no paladin threat nerf is needed.<br />

But that being said, how much of a skillcheck was that aggro dump anyway? I doubt that was what specific mechanic would make the difference for anyone. So basically, who cares? It doesn't really seem to change anything.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NorthernFalcon</div><div class="date">2010-03-06, 12:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Pretty sure the reason for the Marrowgar nerf is that Marrowgar is a potential raid weekly. As a result he needs to be easier than the other bosses in the instance.<br />
<br />
That said, I don't see why people are complaining. You all downed him before, and you're going to down him in the future. It's not like he was hard before, and it's not like he's hard now. What difference does it make?</div></div><hr />

<br />
But, honestly, I like the change on Rotface. Last week our group wiped around 4 hours on this boss, today we downed him in first try (granted, after change and with 5% buff...)<br />
<br />
However, we also killed Putricide directly after on your fourth try ;9<br />
<br />
The disease timer on Rotface was hard for 10man only groups, cause it was the same as in 25man<br />
in 25man this does not pose a problem because there are just more players than in 10 man</div></div><hr />

Tank Threat Generation<br />
3) Damage and therefore threat generation aren't scaling well at very high levels of gear. &lt;-- this is the big one.<br />
(Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/23425588028-do-warriors-really-need-another-cleave.html))<br />
<br />
With all these warriors/dks/paladin tanks stacking armor and so forth, they should have threat scale off armor. As for my understand, most bear tanks don't have issues with threat, so this won't apply to them, even tho their armor is higher than most tanks.<br />
<br />
So, any thoughts on threat scaling with armor?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TobiasX</div><div class="date">2010-03-06, 06:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">at this rate blizz should introduce a third mode of boss fights: EZ MODE! every fight would be a tank n spank. loot could be lower leveled, like i245 in icc10 or i258 in icc25. Cause man, these fights like deathwhisper and saurfang are too hard for casual players who aren't elitist snobs right? ;D<br />
What you've just described is how TBC raiders see Normal Modes now.<br />
<br />
Casual =/= Bad.</div></div><hr />

95% of casuals = bad</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Demran</div><div class="date">2010-03-09, 09:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There is no need to talk about Marrowgar nerf tbh - that nerf was just because of Weekly Raid so the casual players can do that one as well - and that Avarage-Hard Core raiders really dont care about Marrowgar at all (even on Hard Mode).. For the casual players that cant raid icc its a chance to get the first boss down when its weekly raid and also to see icc a little (and maybe to see what they miss inside and become a raider?).<br />
<br />
About Tanking, Paladin's Aoe attacks are also their Single target attacks. You cant expect every different class' tanks to have the same Aoe-Single Target threat-Survivability Talents/Skills.. Thats why they are all unique and thats why all are wanted on 25 mans. If any other tanking classes are not happy about anything they have (which is unlikely at least for warriors since most of the Decent warriors on the forum already told they are very happy and not to touch anything about them) they can just whine about it on their Threads instead of whining about how &quot;so-called&quot; powerful paladin tanks are and they need nerf.<br />
<br />
And for gods sake Blizzard first Threat Nerf to paladins - Than Health nerf to Paladins - Than Loh nerf to paladins - Now again talking about another nerf on threat, why in the nine hells did you do Paladin's like that in the first place if you gonna need to nerf 5-6 times in a row? Or are they only nerfing cuz other classes are whining? Well both results show that there is a problem with Blizz at this point even tho i respect all their decisions and what they do generally i cant say the same for this...</div></div><hr />
