What is the BlizzCon® 2016 Virtual Ticket?<br />
The BlizzCon 2016 Virtual Ticket offers comprehensive live HD coverage of Blizzard Entertainment’s two-day gaming celebration, taking place November 4 and 5, via a multichannel Internet stream.<br />
<br />
When you purchase the Virtual Ticket, you’ll be able to switch freely between multiple high-definition (up to 720p) channels dedicated to different areas of BlizzCon, allowing viewers expanded access to the content they're most interested in. The Virtual Ticket grants you complete access to the main stage and panel stage channels, featuring the following BlizzCon content:<br />
<br />
<br />
Developer Panels: Get the latest news and firsthand developer insight into the creation of your favorite Blizzard games.<br />

Keep an eye on www.blizzcon.com (http://www.blizzcon.com/) for more information.<br />
<br />
If I order the BlizzCon 2016 Virtual Ticket, will I receive the commemorative BlizzCon 2016 in-game goodies?<br />
Yes, Virtual Ticket holders will also receive commemorative BlizzCon 2016 in-game goodies for World of Warcraft, StarCraft II, Diablo III, Hearthstone, Heroes of the Storm, and Overwatch (details to be announced at a later date). The goodies will be linked to the Battle.net account used to purchase or redeem the Virtual Ticket, and will be available in-game at or before the start of BlizzCon. Stay tuned for more information.<br />
<br />
Note that to redeem the Overwatch in-game content for PlayStation 4 or Xbox One, players must link their Battle.net account to a PlayStation Network® account or Xbox Live® account respectively. For more information on account linking, visit https://us.battle.net/support/en/article/linking-your-battlenet-account-on-consoles. Diablo III in-game content is available on PC and Mac only.<br />
<br />
Once I purchase my Virtual Ticket, how do I pre-purchase an optional BlizzCon 2016 Goody Bag in a Box?<br />
This year, Virtual Ticket buyers have the option to purchase one “Goody Bag in a Box”—and just like the name implies, it’s a lot like the usual BlizzCon Goody Bag, only in a box instead of a bag.<br />
<br />
Once you’ve completed your Virtual Ticket purchase or redeemed your Virtual Ticket code, log in to the Blizzard Gear Store (http://gear.blizzard.com (http://gear.blizzard.com/)) using the same Battle.net account. Look for the callout on the front page, or click BlizzCon 2016 in the top navigation bar, where you’ll be able to pre-purchase (limit 1 per Virtual Ticket and Battle.net account).<br />
<br />
Please note that supplies are limited, and buying a Virtual Ticket does *not* guarantee that you’ll be able to also buy a Goody Bag in a Box. Orders will be shipped closer to the start of BlizzCon. For more information, see the Goody Bag in a Box FAQ (http://gear.blizzard.com/blizzcon_goody_bag).<br />
<br />
Will replays of Virtual Ticket content be available after BlizzCon is over?<br />
Yes! Anyone with a Virtual Ticket will be able to access on-demand replays of the main and panel stage streams for at least three weeks after the end of the event. VODs of the esports events will also be available for free.<br />
<br />
How will I access the BlizzCon online merchandise sale for Virtual Ticket buyers?<br />
The pre-BlizzCon merchandise for BlizzCon attendees and Virtual Ticket holders is scheduled to begin October 10.<br />
<br />
After purchasing or redeeming a code for a Virtual Ticket, your Battle.net account will automatically be flagged to get access to the merchandise sale when it begins. Visit www.blizzcon.com closer to the sale for more information.<br />
<br />
Please note that items purchased in this sale will be shipped from the United States. Not all countries may be eligible to participate, and international shipping rates and other fees may apply. For more information, see the Blizzard Gear Store Shipping (https://us.battle.net/support/en/article/blizzard-store-shipping) article on our support site.<br />
<br />
How do I order the Virtual Ticket?<br />
You can order the Virtual Ticket directly through the Battle.net Shop (http://blizz.ly/1WC0KWx). Be sure to make your purchase on the Battle.net account you wish to use to watch the show, receive the in-game goodies, and access the “Goody Bag in a Box” presale and BlizzCon merchandise sale. Also make sure you have a valid, updated payment method associated with your Battle.net account. If you do not yet have a Battle.net account, you can create one for free on the Battle.net website (https://us.battle.net/account/creation/tos.html).<br />
<br />
How can I watch online?<br />
You can watch the Virtual Ticket streams directly through BlizzCon.com. You’ll also be able to download the free BlizzCon 2016 mobile app (coming soon) and watch Virtual Ticket content there—stay tuned for more information.<br />
<br />
In what languages will the Virtual Ticket Internet stream be available?<br />
The BlizzCon 2016 Virtual Ticket Internet stream and DIRECTV broadcast will be available in English only.<br />
<br />
In which regions is the Virtual Ticket available for purchase?<br />
The BlizzCon Virtual Ticket is available through the Battle.net Shop in the Americas, Europe, Russia, Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan, Korea, and Southeast Asia (pricing and availability varies by region). The Virtual Ticket will also be available in China (sold separately). Keep in mind the Virtual Ticket stream purchased through the Battle.net Shop will be available only in English.<br />
<br />
What are the system requirements and minimum bandwidth requirements to view the live stream?<br />
We’ll have more information on the system requirements and minimum bandwidth requirements to view the stream closer to the event.<br />
<br />
Do I need to purchase a Virtual Ticket if I’ve already purchased a ticket to attend BlizzCon in person?<br />
Live BlizzCon attendees also get a Virtual Ticket with their BlizzCon ticket purchase. BlizzCon ticket purchasers will very shortly be receiving a code (one per ticket purchased) which can be used to unlock the Virtual Ticket and associated perks on a single Battle.net account. These codes will be emailed directly to the BlizzCon ticket purchaser.<br />
<br />
I plan to purchase the BlizzCon 2016 Pay Per View event through DIRECTV. Do I need to purchase the Virtual Ticket separately to also watch online?<br />
For those who opt to purchase the BlizzCon 2016 DIRECTV Pay Per View (coming soon), the Virtual Ticket Internet stream will be included with your order. After ordering through DIRECTV, you will receive an email from DIRECTV containing a code that will grant one Battle.net account access to the Virtual Ticket and associated bonuses. You will be able to redeem your code here (https://www.battle.net/code)—just make sure to redeem the code using the Battle.net account on which you wish to receive your in-game goodies.<br />
<br />
Note that the DIRECTV Pay Per View broadcast is not included with purchases of the Virtual Ticket made through the Battle.net Shop. More information on the DIRECTV BlizzCon 2016 Pay Per View event, including how to order through DIRECTV, will be available at a later date. <br />

I tested this last year and dont regret it. Now if there was a &quot;Moose mount&quot; just maybe I would change my mind :) I have bought items from the Blizzard gear store but by the time UK customs have added further cost to US imports its simply awful value. (nearly doubled the cost) This is really a US centric offer.</div></div><hr />

In the UK it's just over £36 including their shipping quote. Considering I only actually like the stein, I don't consider that worth it. It's a shame, 'cause it's a damn good stein. :(</div></div><hr />

Yes, I typically only buy the virtual ticket if the WoW pets are powerful enough. I am a very big pet battler and I feel that the Murkalot pet was the greatest one so far. Hopefully this year will have another one worth buying.</div></div><hr />

The Overwatch themed murloc this round is pretty nice - I have no idea the actual stats for the pets though :)</div></div><hr />

You might be thinking of the WoD one, where the BlizzCon was within a couple of weeks of WoD's release. This will be a few months after Legion, which makes me think it's ripe for new content announcements. Plus I'm hoping for Warcraft remasters, new Overwatch content, and hell maybe even a Diablo 4 though I doubt it. I'm optimistic :)</div></div><hr />

* Hearthstone will maybe get an expansion, Kharazan is around the corner though so maybe not. <br />
* Starcraft seems to be done, didn't really felt like the coop mode or Nova campaign made big enough waves to justify investing further into it.<br />
* I expected a Diablo 3 expansion last year, but since Josh Mosqueira and a few others left I think it sounds more like a D3 expansion got cancelled.<br />
* Warcraft gets Legion so I wouldn't expected anything there<br />
* Overwatch feels a little too early to have a full expansion. Maybe a mappack or a fighter pack. <br />
* A new movie will probably take a few years.<br />
<br />
And a new IP after overwatch is not very likely. I honestly have no idea what they want to show.</div></div><hr />

And this is a reason for excitement. Gonna be a curveball this time, especially with the 10 year anniversary theme. Doesn't really matter to me as I attend in person every year no matter what. Anybody who's ever physically gone to Blizzcon knows the real reason so many people go. Hint: It's not the just the con itself or the games/content that's previewed.</div></div><hr />

I would not get too hyped. Blizz already had Blizzcons where they showed little more than stuff that was already known/released. Sure one can hope for a surprise, but I think this will be a blizzcon mainly for people who are physically there. I wouldn't count on any big releases.</div></div><hr />

The experience. Being there with other gamers who enjoy everything you do. The atmosphere. The after parties. Being social, meeting new people with similar interests. Memories. <br />

Good thing I don't need big releases to happen to be satisfied with being there. Previews of upcoming Legion patches, some info on the unannounced Diablo project would be cool. As I said, it's not all about the stuff they show. It's about the experience. Can't really understand until you're actually there. <br />

<br />
As a 10/10 attendee, the reason that my wife and I go every year is<br />
<br />
<br />
Get hyped<br />
Attend as many signings as we can to meet the developers, artists, producers, testers, etc and sincerely thank them for their hard work and enjoyable products. I gave the gal who built the Act 1 dinning tables a big high five because those things are THE BEST to explode with spells. I shook Ion Hazzikostas's hand even though i do not agree with some of the things his team did in Warlords because the guy takes a LOT of shit from people and tries hard and frankly, looked like he needed a hug, not a handshake. <br />
have those same people sign our poster, which we frame and display at home in our office. We've gotten Morhaime, Metzen, Samwise, Peter Lee, Day 9, Browder, Wilson, Kaplan, Greg Street, Eric Dodd, Method raiding team, Jennifer Hale, Trisha Helfer, Jennifer Bailey, so many other voice actors from all the video games they've done, and a lot of other team members who normally do not get much public credit for their work. <br />
Attend the smaller panels that aren't on the stream like the voice acting panel and some of the art demos. We got to watch about 8 people from the heroes voice cast re-enact other game cinematic in character and do some custom scenes. <br />
see the cool costumes. It's not the same when you look at a photo. Nothing replaces seeing someone walking around in a giant mistress of pain costume, or 5 people puppeteering a 10ft long illuminated frostwyrm. <br />
play demos. It's been pretty fun getting early looks at heroes, hearthstone, and overwatch. <br />
be in the crowd when they announce something like overwatch. It came out of nowhere and people were stunned and then immediately *hungry* for more. Never felt anything like that at a Blizzcon except maybe when they announced Wrath. <br />
Have a good time. It's nice to have a reason to take a vacation sometimes.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">huehuehue</div><div class="date">2016-07-26, 01:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Lol, still $40. Guess pirated streams it is, because they don't offer a cheaper package without the pets and other crap you pay for.</div></div><hr />

With 30 euro I can play the game for 2 months or pay for 7 months or Origin Access to play a bunch of games, while having PVP stream for free during BlizzCon and all important clips and stories from BlizzCon very very shortly after the live event happens.<br />
Anyway, like I have said, last year the virtual ticket really felt disapointing for me. Not willing to pay even half of that.</div></div><hr />

Do we know what the overwatch goodies are? I'm hoping for a skin but it's likely a spray / hero icon.<br />

That's funny because outside of America I pay GBP for my sub. I paid GBP for previous virtual tickets so why should I be given it for free?. £25 here is $40 in America so it would not matter where I bought it. But like Mazzic518 said a whole lot of derp here. Also the AUD is more than the USD accept it or don't buy it. Just like the Canadian Dollar is more than the average US dollar.</div></div><hr />

You mean for one year each for 2007 and 2008? Literally every other year has been a pet and other goodies for every game. Every other Blizzcon in regards to WoW was pets.</div></div><hr />
