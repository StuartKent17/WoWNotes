Yeah, this. I never payed much attention back then, but after reading that they basically redid half the zone during alpha I find it interesting that they are now using this version.</div></div><hr />

I will have to accept it either way, pointless argument. I'm not a massive fan of allied races anyway, I would of much preferred sub-races so we could customise our characters we already have. I'm talking skin colours, tattoo's, cosmetics, etc..</div></div><hr />

<br />
Xe'ra sent us there on her quest, so I assume the world are still fully connected through their leyline physics.<br />
I see no reason why anyone would think &quot;outland&quot; when blizzard says &quot;Draenor&quot; I know full well that's how the planet used to be named, but now we have a clear other planet referred to as such.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, the Blingtron quest for Engineers, which is a Legion quest, has you visit Area 52 as part of it. So, it must still be possible, in lore. (I'm sure there are other examples that I'm not thinking of)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I mean surely that shithole outlands must have boiled away into space by now and what was left of the Mag'har Orcs prolly died at the seige of Orgrimmar so this is a brilliant decision by the Horde leadership to recruit a whole planet load of Badass Orcs hungry and ready for battle.</div></div><hr />

<br />
the connection between outland and azeroth is permanent. so, while the portal to alternate draenor replaced the portal to outland, the connection that portal created will always be there. that means that mages and such can get portals to it relatively easily still.<br />
<br />
now, the outland mag'har are already part of the horde. so it wouldn't really make that much sense to go out and recruit them to the horde. recruiting the draenor orcs into the horde makes sense, that's a massive population increase for the horde. thousands of orcs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As for No Mag'har, my understanding is there were almost none left, even before Garrosh's ascension. They had that one outpost in HFP and a few tiny settlements in Nagrand, that's it. You can't fashion an entire subrace fighting force out of a few villages, certainly not if they just want to be left alone (they did reject the Horde before). Getting the Draenor Orcs onboard though, after showing them a successful Horde, that would give us the army we need. #GarroshDidNothingWrong</div></div><hr />

I'm keeping my fingers and toes crossed that it involves AU Draenor-- It had so many great questlines out there and good storytelling in the zones.

Would be nice to have Yrel back though<br />
<br />
In an ironic twist..... The Alliance will get Gorgrond Orcs and the Horde AU Draenei.......</div></div><hr />

So Velen will be dead in Battle for Azeroth and Yrel is the new leader of the Draenei? If the Orcs are real for us then Velen must be dead and Yrel the new leader or it wasn't and Alternate Universe after all.<br />

Nah, MU Velen and Anduin have the thickest plot armour in the game at this point, they won't die for a very VERY long time. AU Velen is dead, AU Yrel is the leader of AU spacegoats.</div></div><hr />

I think you're discounting the thickness of Sylvanas &quot;Literally Died Multiple Times Already&quot; Windrunner's Fanservice Armor.</div></div><hr />

Anduin is destined to rule Alliance and lead the Army of Light for at least 40+ years. It's BiS plot armour in the game/lore so far.<br />

Hers got nothing on it.</div></div><hr />
