<br />
Enhancement Shaman PTR Changes<br />
In an upcoming Public Test Realm (PTR) build, several changes are coming for Enhancement Shamans.<br />
<br />
We’re adjusting the following talents:<br />
<br />
<br />
Boulderfist (https://www.wowdb.com/spells/246035-boulderfist) damage bonus increased to 35%.<br />
Lightning Shield (https://www.wowdb.com/spells/192106-lightning-shield) will no longer generate any bonus Maelstrom when the Lightning Shield overcharges.<br />
Landslide (https://www.wowdb.com/spells/197992-landslide) changed to a 40% proc chance.<br />
Forceful Winds (https://www.wowdb.com/spells/262647-forceful-winds) reduced from 100% per stack to 80% per stack. Totem Mastery (https://www.wowdb.com/spells/262395-totem-mastery): the Storm Totem benefit increased from 5% to 10%.<br />
Hailstorm's (https://www.wowdb.com/spells/210853-hailstorm) damage increased by 50%.<br />
Overcharge (https://www.wowdb.com/spells/210727-overcharge) now causes a 9 second cooldown to Lightning Bolt, down from 12 seconds.<br />
Fury of Air (https://www.wowdb.com/spells/197211-fury-of-air) damage increased by 40%.<br />
Crashing Storm (https://www.wowdb.com/spells/192246-crashing-storm) damage increased by 40%.<br />
<br />
<br />
Lightning Shield and Forceful Winds are both popular talents right now, and we don’t want to reduce Enhancement’s overall damage with changes to those two talents, so additionally:<br />
<br />
<br />
The damage done by all Enhancement abilities increased by 5%.<br />
<br />
The changes above should help make the different choices on many talent rows much more competitive with each other.<br />
<br />
In addition to these changes above, we’re adjusting how many tooltips are generated. This may cause some websites to show that the damage or healing of almost every single Enhancement ability has changed. Do not panic; we are not lowering all of your damage and healing! This will be a behind-the-scenes data adjustment only.<br />
<br />
Thank you for testing with us on the PTR!<br />

Eurogamer Interview with Alex Afrasiabi about Sylvanas<br />
Eurogamer sat down with Alex Afrasiabi (https://www.eurogamer.net/amp/2018-11-08-world-of-warcraft-and-the-masterplan-for-sylvanas) to discuss Sylvanas and the story of Battle for Azeroth.<br />
<br />
<br />
https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/november/thumb/sylvanasinterview.jpg (https://www.eurogamer.net/amp/2018-11-08-world-of-warcraft-and-the-masterplan-for-sylvanas) <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Having a divided fanbase for a character is a lot more interesting than a one-sided, clearly the right direction path.<br />
The goal was to create enough plausible deniability in the actions Sylvanas has committed where she can still have a fanbase.<br />
Alex says that her actions are not necessarily out of character as she has been a driving force for many questionable decisions, such as the blight, over the years.<br />
He refers to the Wrathgate as being under Sylvanas's orders...?<br />
Your choice made to back either Sylvanas or Saurfang will play out over the story and you will find out if you are right or wrong.<br />
For the moment, Sylvanas seems to be too well liked to simply kill off.<br />
The developerbase and Alex are all fans of Sylvanas as well and making her a raid boss would be a bit of a let down.<br />
There is a lot more to Sylvanas's story that hasn't been told yet.<br />
<br />
<br />

Forbes Interview with Ion Hazzikostas About War Mode<br />
Forbes interviewed game director Ion Hazzokostas (https://www.forbes.com/sites/hnewman/2018/11/07/blizzard-working-to-balance-warcrafts-alliance-and-horde-players-in-war-mode-raiding/#88d48fb3c183) about the state of War Mode.<br />
<br />
<br />
https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/november/thumb/forbesbfa.jpg (https://www.forbes.com/sites/hnewman/2018/11/07/blizzard-working-to-balance-warcrafts-alliance-and-horde-players-in-war-mode-raiding/#88d48fb3c183) <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
There is a relatively even balance of people who play Alliance or Horde.<br />
Overall win rates in random battlegrounds are &quot;shockingly even.&quot;<br />
Epic battlegrounds tend to favor Alliance and the other battlegrounds skew a bit more in the Horde's favor.<br />
The ratio seems of win rates is about 54% Horde and 46% Alliance, not including Rated Battlegrounds.<br />
The amount of players who utilize War Mode currently skew towards Horde.<br />
In Tides of Vengeance, the team is looking into offering some kind of increased rewards for the less-represented faction in War Mode, so the risk and reward are better calibrated.<br />
Ion suspects that many Alliance players had bad experiences in War Mode in the beginning of the expansion and have turned off War Mode because of it.<br />
The purpose of increased awards is to make up for the risk of being killed by the opposite faction, but they want to keep this on equal grounds, and their hope is that increasing the rewards of the less represented faction will encourage more people to activate War Mode when their faction is at a disadvantage.<br />
Ion admits that Beserking is a bit too powerful of a racial ability for some classes and this is why it is receiving a small nerf.<br />
Historically, PvP severs have always been more Horde-favored. It might have to do with player identity in the game, such as wanting to be something battle-hardened like an orc.<br />
Blizzard is also keeping an eye on class and specialization appearance rates in PvP combat.<br />

yeah that one been a theory for many many years, that Sylvanas knew about the plans for the wrath gate and the betrayal. But she let it happen bc it was good for her.</div></div><hr />

I play Alliance and I can't confirm your observation.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Firebeast</div><div class="date">2018-11-10, 08:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ion is delusional at best. Alliance don't use war mode because they are sick of the imbalance. He won't admit or doesn't care. Also don't give me crap about the racials not being a part of it. When you look at racials on sites like Bloodmallet, most of the Alliance ones are at the bottom for almost all the classes. He is a Horde player so he will never see the Alliance side on anything</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gadzooks</div><div class="date">2018-11-10, 08:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So, Ion has nice shiny numbers on warmode to design from. He does love to prattle on about numbers, doesn't he? <br />
<br />
Maybe that's the reason things are so off, approaching a game design from a spreadsheet, and not creative ideas? Hmm? <br />
<br />
And, when you see class &quot;fixes&quot; at 40 and 50%, holy shit. <br />
<br />
The &quot;Sylvanas maybe ordered the Wrathgate&quot; thing will go down...not well. I've been told, quite forcefully, by lore nerds that she was NOT behind it, and the story as told in the game is that Varimathras and Putress betrayed Sylvanas, to take control of Undercity in an attempted coup, which is why Sylvanas personally helps Horde players retake it. If they're gonna retcon that, then just fuck it, lore means nothing. They're turning her into a dumb Dr. Evil level villain. Her entire story arc from day one was finding a home for the Forsaken and protecting them, now she's just letting thousands of them die in mustachio twirling plots? Awful, just awful.<br />

<br />
I play both Horde and Alliance and I can confirm his observation (EU) with one exception:<br />
- Horde queueing in Russian / German premades loses 90% of the time.<br />
<br />
My other observation is that when you queue on the dominating faction (horde), the matching algorithm tend to put you against those premades to make you loose. Clever system.</div></div><hr />

it is revealed that Putress and several members of the Royal Apothecary Society had sided with Varimathra after the events at the wrathgate. <br />
<br />
Sylvanas knew about the new plague putress made and she wanted to use it against the scourge because the new plague was able to cause fatal damage to undead beings.<br />

Yup. Sadly, this is true. She's an interesting character - or used to be, but it was never the &quot;hot sexy undead night elf waifu in a leather bikini&quot; for me. <br />
<br />
She should have died for good, jumping off of Icecrown. That would have made her story arc poignant, meaningful, and bittersweet. But I guess Sylvanas Whiplash is better? For reasons? I guess cold, dead boobs are important.</div></div><hr />

Those crazy fuckers are gonna make a third faction. And Alleria will run it, and Sylvanas will get redemption joining her, because Blizzard writers have an eternal boner for redemption.</div></div><hr />

No way that Teldrassil would burn up so quickly with just a few fiery catapult shots.<br />

Fiery catapult shots don't melt world trees! <br />
Teldrassil was an inside job. Put in motion by Saurfang and Malfurion to get Tyrande to become a Night Warrior to dispose of Sylvanas and make Saurfang the leader. Sadly both Malfy and Saurfang are being manipulated into this by the true mastermind; Zappy boi<br />

Wait wtf? Are they just retconing the lore now? Also, all that talk about Sylvanas being grey or having less evil motives for doing a lot of what she's done since BfA is just thrown out the window. What exactly do they plan on doing at this point. They say they wont kill her off....yet. They want to give players the illusion of a choice siding with Suarfang or Sylvanas when we know that it is going to play out one way or another. So far everything she has done in BfA seems pretty evil, even if I agree with some of it. I don't know what they are doing anymore and I don't think they do either.</div></div><hr />

How ironic your name is Highelf. But on topic, no, you are wrong. I'm talking about a solution to the current problem. Because THERE IS a problem. And if the Alliance doesn't feel like enabling warmode, there must be something that has to be done to balance things out. Saying &quot;you just suck&quot; won't solve a thing.<br />
<br />
Even if the Alliance are all babies, it does not minimize the fact there is currently no balance and that's to the detriment of some players.</div></div><hr />

How is it ironic? I don't whine about high elves. I just like them a lot which even precedes this game and crosses over to Warmhammer and LOTR.<br />
<br />
Yes, I am right.<br />
<br />
Too many times do I see alliance whining about getting ganked or that they're outnumbered. The easy solution would be to recruit people in the zone or from your guild or even from Boralus. Alas, you'll either get no response from your fellow Alliance or they'll use the typical snowflake response and say, then just turn WM off when all you're doing is trying to get help from your fellow members.<br />
<br />
This has gone on for MANY years, not just this expansion, the funniest thing is when a pve server got merged with a pvp one and they were all like, wait, the horde can attack us in the open world? Blizzard sucks, etc lol. <br />
<br />
So blizzard gives you an option now to turn it off, and honestly is the 10% really THAT big of a deal? And they still complain. The ones that WANT to do something about it, have very little support.</div></div><hr />

exactly this. regardless of slightly increased reward it is not fun trying to do daily quests, or simply walk into a mythic plus dungeon entrance with an opposite faction 20 person raid camping anything you want to participate at. some of us don't have the time to waste on this kind of gameplay. it isn't fun. if the childred in the raid group that are killing the individual player going about their business are honest with themselves it isn't truly fun for them either.<br />

you had half an idea anyway. the bonuses should not be shut off simply because there are no opponents. but yes sharding raid groups to different places than individuals would be an excellent start.

Forced by way of game design, not literally with a gun to my head.<br />
<br />
For the 1st month having wm on completing every wq was a MASSIVE advantage to the point where you were gimping yourself in pve by not doing it.<br />
<br />
I rolled on a pve server for a reason, there should never be rewards for a system that is so one sided.<br />

<br />
<br />
The sad thing is how they devide the fanbase. Making a cool character and then suddenly saying &quot;Oh, she is evil, into genocide, betrayed you all and was standing behind Wrathgate&quot; is not exactly very creative. They pretend they have now one side standing behind her actions and one side that is against her actions...but the truth is they actually have one side that goes with the sudden character turn out of nowhere while the other side says &quot;This is BS! We want our Sylvannas back.&quot;. Hardly anyone likes an all selfish Sylvannas that is abusing the Horde to create an undead world. <br />
From a tactical point of view Wrathgate would have been a mistake...so is the burning of Teldrassil(cause it was obvious that Undercity would then be attacked and the Undead would lose their home. A smart Sylvannas would have attacked the Worgen instead to keep them from her doorstep and conquer all of Lordaeron to defend it together with the Blood Elves. Kalimdor anyway belonged to the Horde already and the Night Elves sitting on their Island did not matter.). Sylvannas shall be portrayed as an evil genius but her decisions are the opposite. Her longterm plan behind it will likely end up like the LOST TV-series(to those that don't know it. That series was about a lot of mystery where at the end the ends didn't meet at all. They screwed up badly and basicly showed the middlefinger to the fans that thought there is something behind the story and watched it to the end.).<br />
I have more the feeling that all this goes on to draw some clear war fronts. Kalimdor vs. Eastern Kingdom(watch out Blood Elves...and Draenei). Possibly for the final of WoW where the war is settled and each faction got their continent devided by water and maybe some magic wall by deathwing junior or something like that.</div></div><hr />

Weren't forced? Just yesterday I turned it on, and there is no contest. I can only do so much when we are vastly outnumbered. Even when horde play incredible bad, backpedaling hunters, it does not matter. You are zerged down. <br />
<br />
So tell me, if I only have 20-30minutes to do Champions of Azerite for my alt, why would I put on wm and have this take well over an hour? Horde rarely have to corpserun, if you pick on a horde, the zerg jumps on you, so they have free wm benefits (talents&amp;bonus). Stop spreading bullshit<br />

I just wanted to play an Orc, a troll, and maybe even a cow-person. I didn't want to play human, because I am one in real life. I didn't want to play tired-old-played-out-elves. Gnomes are just straight up annoying to me. Dwarves are cool, but they're lumped in with all the other lames so no thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeh in an election, a 8 point victory is a landslide.<br />
<br />
51/49 Is close, 54/46 is a gigantic advantage for the 54% side. <br />
<br />
I guess they are hoping most people don't realise this and assume that 54/46 is close.</div></div><hr />

Instead of getting good at your class, joining or starting a pvp group or even guild. All you Alliance babies say:<br />

There should be....<br />

I tried numerous times to create a counter-attack when the Horde had roaming 40mans. After massing up to 10 players, the Horde would find us, and we still didn't stand a chance. I suspect that with current shard populations, getting a counter-group that can match a full raid is near-impossible.</div></div><hr />

I'm not sure where you're getting YOUR numbers, because I know in my experience (I main Horde),<br />
Horde loses battlegrounds a vast majority of the time. Let's not even talk about how many out of 10<br />
that Horde wins AV (It's not even 3).</div></div><hr />

Just yesterday I turned it on, and there is no contest. I can only do so much when we are vastly outnumbered. Even when horde play incredible bad, backpedaling hunters, it does not matter. You are zerged down. <br />
<br />
So tell me, if I only have 20-30minutes to do Champions of Azerite for my alt, why would I put on wm and have this take well over an hour? Horde rarely have to corpserun, if you pick on a horde, the zerg jumps on you, so they have free wm benefits (talents&amp;bonus). Stop spreading bullshit<br />
<br />
Horde: I knew what would happen when I turn wm on, benefits of talents and bonus lmao<br />
<br />
Again, you're not forced to use it. You can get the same quest done without it and without the minimal benefits, and at this point, if you've been playing fairly regularly, you shouldn't need those bonuses much anyways. Especially if you only have &quot;20-30 minutes&quot;. <br />
<br />
<br />
And you just proved my point to the core. If you attack a horde, others will show up and help. Alliance, that is very rare.<br />

Making a cool character and then suddenly saying &quot;Oh, she is evil, into genocide, betrayed you all and was standing behind Wrathgate&quot; is not exactly very creative. They pretend they have now one side standing behind her actions and one side that is against her actions...but the truth is they actually have one side that goes with the sudden character turn out of nowhere while the other side says &quot;This is BS! We want our Sylvannas back.&quot;. Hardly anyone likes an all selfish Sylvannas that is abusing the Horde to create an undead world. <br />
From a tactical point of view Wrathgate would have been a mistake...so is the burning of Teldrassil(cause it was obvious that Undercity would then be attacked and the Undead would lose their home. A smart Sylvannas would have attacked the Worgen instead to keep them from her doorstep and conquer all of Lordaeron to defend it together with the Blood Elves. Kalimdor anyway belonged to the Horde already and the Night Elves sitting on their Island did not matter.). Sylvannas shall be portrayed as an evil genius but her decisions are the opposite. Her longterm plan behind it will likely end up like the LOST TV-series(to those that don't know it. That series was about a lot of mystery where at the end the ends didn't meet at all. They screwed up badly and basicly showed the middlefinger to the fans that thought there is something behind the story and watched it to the end.).<br />
I have more the feeling that all this goes on to draw some clear war fronts. Kalimdor vs. Eastern Kingdom(watch out Blood Elves...and Draenei). Possibly for the final of WoW where the war is settled and each faction got their continent devided by water and maybe some magic wall by deathwing junior or something like that.<br />
<br />
Their writing has never been award winning creativity. The story now is no better or worse than it always has been. Just enjoy it for what it is, or dont and move on. I dont get all these threads of people complaining about the story and how it's not creative. The entire arthas story was a fantasy version of Darth Vader, which was a sci fi version of other similar stories, and so on. Warcraft stories have never been some original masterpiece people seem to think it was and isn't now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's fine if Wpvp is imbalanced - to an extent. As long as there is the possibility of counterplay, a small-scale imbalance of players is fine. Having a roaming 40man camp single players for hours is not. There is almost no counterplay to that. Believe me, I've tried. The only way to counter is to mass your own 40man via groupfinder, while remaining hidden from the roaming enemy. Most people don't care to join a 40man (and potentially still lose), they just want to do their damn WQs.<br />

<br />
she didnt order it but she knew well about it, and the plan of protridus and Varimathas, it was claim on the book and ingame that she let it happen bc it was a easy way to remove the traiterous from Undercity. <br />
<br />
<br />
She is a manipulative person that why do anything for what she want. She been like that since W3</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's called &quot;Something some will like others not and i'm not the very best expert to decide because trending omg bad writing&quot;<br />
<br />
We have asked for more character development and giving us more story and background, even if it's not perfect to suit everyone tastes we all should acknowlege that they are trying to give us what we asked, but why is it so hard to at least include &quot;I appreciate your efforts but I don't like it&quot;, oh yeah, entitled people in the internet, welcome to the 21 century.<br />
<br />
If this trending of bad writing went on in classic and bc and lich, i'm sure as hell people would be complaining as much.<br />
<br />

<br />
Their writing has never been award winning creativity. The story now is no better or worse than it always has been. Just enjoy it for what it is, or dont and move on. I dont get all these threads of people complaining about the story and how it's not creative. The entire arthas story was a fantasy version of Darth Vader, which was a sci fi version of other similar stories, and so on. Warcraft stories have never been some original masterpiece people seem to think it was and isn't now.<br />
<br />
Thank you, some don't realise they just got taken by a trend wanting to be part of something it does not exist, because it's a videogame, and don't get me wrong I loved warcraft 3 and love wow, I will keep enjoying this story as long as they continue with it.<br />
<br />
If you truly love wow lore, you can tell they are making extra effot in expanding it, even if it's not perfect, even if it's absurd or it is very good, but why try to see that? better to hop on to the train of &quot;bad writing&quot; because is popular.</div></div><hr />

I don't mind Warmode being on all the time, however, I hate it when there is an alliance raid camping the Tortollan world quests with a 20 man raid and you ask for help from Horde and they do nothing about it</div></div><hr />

<br />
What I dislike most about War Mode is that for some classes there are a number of EXTREMELY useful PVE talents locked behind flagging. War Mode should not have special talents associated with it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Shadow and Shaman Players: &quot;We don't like the mechanics, the play style!&quot; <br />
Blizz: &quot;We'll give you the revamp, but we can't do it in the beta, not enough time so I'm sorry you'll have to wait till 8.1&quot;<br />
Players &quot;We're waiting Blizz&quot;<br />
Blizz &quot;We gotcha fam, here you go...damage buffs all around! Everything is better!&quot;<br />
<br />
Not even damage buffs all around. It's them adjusting talents in a bid to increase talent diversity, which was never the main problem, in a way that winds up being a nerf to the enhancement spec.<br />

I'm sure the shareholders have seen it, it's probably one of the reasons the Blizzard stock is still falling. It's funny how a company I used to love is turning into a campany I'm starting to hate.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Plausable deniability is gone when you go &quot;burn it! BURN IT!!!&quot; Plausable deniability would have been her taking DS, preparing to invade Teldrassil and then it went up in flames while a zoom to her face showed a smile. Did she plan it or does she see it as something she can use to push her ideal of unavoidable war. She's done so before.<br />
<br />
Plausable diniability is ambivalence regarding events, There's nothig ambivalent about &quot;burn it! BURN IT!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
- And if Forsaken as undead are immune to Void MC then she took the decision of her own.<br />
<br />
- If someone swooped in a torched the place that changes nothing about her giving the order and fully intending to commit genocide.<br />
<br />
- If a deal made either her die in exchange for killing them, then she's both selfish and evil. As they mean less to her than herself.</div></div><hr />

<br />
are you aware that if you fallow the lore of Wrath, outside the game like blizzard always do, was already imply many many years ago that Sylvanas knew about the whole Wrath gate, but she didnt stop it bc she saw away to remove 2 things at the same time, she knew about Varhimatas betrayal already and the plague will kill the Lich King. So she didnt care about leting they use it, and having later the alliance and horde purging Under city from traitors. <br />
<br />
That is the thing that for some reason you guys tent to ignore all the short story and novels. Not to speak that Sylvanas been playing this part of treacherous leader for a long long time already .</div></div><hr />

Well that got a flat 5% buff recently too if I remember...but either way...they promised changes that didn't come in the beta, promised them for 8.1...and then all that is received is bandaid number buffs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's an understatement. I started with it on... after getting killed and camped by groups of 5 horde, or raid groups... YEAH, i turned it OFF. 1 v 1 in open space is fun, 5 or 10 v 1 and being camped STINKS. 10% extra stuff for 200% longer quest time... NO THX. I might be more inclined to click yes if it would automatically disable it if someone was in a group larger than 2,3, etc..., or after pvp killed, you get the option to DISABLE it while dead. If you want to turn it back on, there'd be a CD, or at least have to hearth back to SW.</div></div><hr />

<br />
51/49 Is close, 54/46 is a gigantic advantage for the 54% side. <br />
<br />
I guess they are hoping most people don't realise this and assume that 54/46 is close.<br />
<br />
To go along with this... in Heroes of the Storm, if a character has a 54% win ratio, they nerf it. If it has a 46% win ratio, they redesign it to make it better. Blizz's own HoTS team knows a 54/46 ratio is a big difference. It's too bad their WoW team doesn't...</div></div><hr />

<br />
'Divided', indeed. I've never seen the WoW community this whiny about faction &quot;pride&quot; before, so they certainly succeeded on that front.</div></div><hr />
