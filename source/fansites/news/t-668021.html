PvP balance and Rewards<br />
We make balance changes for BG PvP all the time. We make fewer changes due to world PvP (I'm talking mostly about PvP servers) but those still exist.<br />
<br />
Most of the PvP discussions in these forums tend to focus on Arena balance because frankly that's what most of the participants here seem interested in discussing. If I had to guess, it's because you are constantly running into BG situations in which class balance makes very little difference, say the other team was smarter with how they handled the flags. Or maybe you just plain went up against 20 opponents at once, in which even our most naive posters don't really expect their 51-point talent or whatever to be able to save them. That's not to say you can't have interesting discussions about BG strategy or even BG balance issues... but that's not the purpose of these role forums. Perhaps Arenas just shine a harsher light on class balance than do BGs.<br />
<br />
We have acknowledged that we need to offer better PvP rewards for players who like BGs over Arenas. You shouldn't assume that means you can just AFK your way to epics though. You need to win a lot of BGs to get the best rewards. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/19820323013-world-of-arenacraft.html))<br />

Argent Tournament progression reset on Faction Change<br />
Simply put, while it was not a decision we enjoyed making, due to the way the Argent Tournament functions it was not feasible on a technical level to properly switch progress between factions. I am sorry we were unable to offer a better solution. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/19717644824-please-explain-argent-tournament-reset.html))<br />

Faction Changes in Europe<br />
We just wanted to inform you that the deliberately staggered release of the Paid Faction Change service is still on track. We will of course update you when the service is available for use in Europe. Until that time, we appreciate your patience and understanding.<br />
<br />
Being keen WoW players, we are also very interested in this new service and are excitedly looking forward to having it available in Europe also. Thanks again for your patience everyone. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/10711192751-faction-change-us-only-when-is-eu-getting-it.html))<br />

Thunderclap and Tanks homogeinzation<br />
Thunderclap is used as an AE threat tool in 5-player heroics. We found certain classes struggled tanking those instances if they lacked certain tools. An AP debuff isn't really needed in the 5-player runs though. It is as mandatory as debuffs get in a raid environment, but there are plenty of ways to get it.<br />
<br />
We are even less likely to homogenize the classes by sharing all of their tools around than we are to make the armor, health and cooldowns of the tanking classes identical. The point I was trying to make is that &quot;The community generally agrees on what tanks need to be balanced&quot; (essentially the thrust of the original quote I referenced) is a difficult point of view to support. There are constant threads of &quot;We can't do our job without X.&quot; We don't just dismiss those concerns out of hand, but you need to argue from the stance that you literally can't do your job, not that everyone needs all of the same abilities, because the latter just isn't our goal. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/19717545561-accepted-imbalances.html))<br />
<br />
Tanking classes disparities (Make sure you read the whole post (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/19820872435-logic-of-since-you-arent-being-replaced.html))<br />
For Sartharion and for Vezax (to name just two encounters) it felt* this way with DKs. Enough* guilds seemed like they were swapping to DKs for those fights because they made the encounter just so much easier. In fact, they made a lot of fights easier, so the conventional wisdom seemed to be just tank everything with a DK. (As another example, the conventional wisdom in BC heroics and Mount Hyjal seemed to be to use a paladin tank because of their huge AE threat advantage.)<br />
<br />
I understand that a lot of players who post here think that paladin tanks are in that situation now and DK tanks are in the reverse situation where they struggle with a lot of fights. But they are not in that situation, at least not yet, because we don't see the widespread swapping. That suggests that perhaps the advantages concluded from theorycrafting aren't so massive that tank swapping conveys a huge advantage. It could very well change over time to get that way, but it hasn't happened yet.<br />
<br />
We've been talking about potential DK buffs for 3.2.2 and we even know how we would nerf Ardent Defender when and if we think* it has gotten out of control. <br />
<br />
* - I used these wishy washy words on purpose because I want to reiterate that this is VERY SUBJECTIVE. There is not a magic number beyond which the tank imbalance klaxon goes off at Blizzard Entertainment HQ. There is not a specific threshold of guilds nor a critical skill level for those guilds that warrant them being included or not included in the test.<br />
<br />
We want to see more paladin and druid MTs, and part of that includes raiders accepting them as legitimate tanking classes, and those players feeling that if they go through the effort to gear up that we're not going to banish them down to OT status again. Similarly, we wanted to slow down the number of groups that appeared to be swapping to a DK for their MT, seemingly permanently, because they were convinced they would just always be the best tank. We have no problem with warriors being the most popular tank (and they still are) because there is a long legacy there and a lot of those characters have been around awhile. But we also want the other 3 tanking classes to feel legit. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/19820872435-logic-of-since-you-arent-being-replaced.html))<br />

DK Changes in latest PTR Patch<br />
The DK changes were trying to fix two issues: buffing tanks a little and getting Unholy to use Scourge Strike again, which a great many Unholy DKs asked us to fix.<br />
<br />
I don't have time to compare what you've data-mined to the actual patch notes, but you might want to wait for the official notes before jumping too to many conclusions. <br />
<br />
[...] We weren't trying to buff or nerf Unholy per se. We just wanted to get the spec back to using Scourge Strike, which these changes should do, and as I said, was something many DKs requested. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/19820872699-yay--more-dk-nerfs.html))<br />
<br />
[...] I think you guys are too premature on your math. Let some players chew on it for a bit. The Dirge change could very well be a couple hundred dps loss for using Obliterate as Unholy, while the Subversion and SS glyph change could be a couple hundred dps gain for SS. SS and Obliterate were not off by 2000 dps before. They might be off by more in Icecrown, but that depends a lot on what the gear looks like... and we haven't finished it yet.<br />
<br />
If SS isn't quite there yet, we still have time to make additional changes, but I am loathe to actually say that for fear players will hear &quot;GC says if we keep disparaging SS they might buff us some more!&quot; (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/19820872699-yay--more-dk-nerfs.html))<br />
<br />
Reasons behind the recent nerfs<br />
I think calling it a baseline strike is just a technicality. If it was 1 point Frost talent, Unholy still would have taken it. Base Obliterate and SS might have been pretty close, but Oblit benefitted from so many more things than SS. The SS glyph was a wash at best (and annoying at worst), while the Obliterate glyph was a big dps increase. Obliterate got much more crit than SS. Obliterate benefitted from a lot of rp gain, including very questionable talents like Dirge. (Why does a deep Unholy talent need to benefit a strike that Unholy isn't really supposed to use anyway?)<br />
<br />
Unholy dps was appropriate, but it was just using the &quot;wrong&quot; (but a very similar) FU attack. The last thing the DK class needs is yet another buff or debuff tied to an attack and I'm not sure the class really even needs another mechanic to have to watch or track tied to Scourge Strike. Doing Shadow damage is a fine niche, and in a world without armor penetration doing spell damage wouldn't be a liability.

Beastial Wrath Changes<br />
It should be no surprise to anyone who has been on these boards for long that we're trying to chill out abilities that convey offensive and defensive bonuses with the same button press. At the same time, BM damage was a little low and too dependent on the pet. With this change, hopefully, Bestial Wrath becomes more of a defensive ability while taking Beast Within will boost hunter (and just the hunter) damage at all times.<br />
<br />
I call it more of a defensive cooldown because it now breaks all CC like a PvP trinket. <br />
<br />
[...] “Send your pet into a rage causing 50% additional damage for 10 sec (down from 18). While enraged, the beast does not feel pity or remorse or fear and it cannot be stopped unless killed.”<br />
<br />
The tooltip doesn’t say this, but it now breaks all forms of CC that a PvP trinket would break (including Cyclone, Sap, etc.).<br />
<br />
“Increases all damage you deal by 10% and while your pet is under the effects of Bestial Wrath, you also go into a rage causing 10% additional damage and reducing mana costs of all spells by 20% for 10 sec (down from 18). While enraged, you do not feel pity or remorse or fear and you cannot be stopped unless killed.”<br />
<br />
So the changes are:<br />
Duration lowered.<br />
Passive hunter damage buff added.<br />
Now breaks all forms of CC (whatever a PvP trinket breaks, including Sap and Cyclone). (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/19820512759-beastial-wrath-change.html))<br />
<br />
BM Changes duration reduction and extra mana usage<br />
It wasn't our intent to push BM hunters into Viper more often with this change so we are discussing buffing the mana cost portion of the talent from 20% to perhaps as high as 50%. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/19820512759-beastial-wrath-change.html))</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Christ, did the developers catch rabies or something?<br />
<br />
<br />
Honestly, the free PvP trinket is fairly needed. The only way Hunters are even slightly viable in PvP right now is with Beast Cleave, we have very little survivability and not much burst either, which are both fairly essential parts of PvP. You can go ahead and say &quot;but you guys have Deterrence&quot;, but that doesn't make as much of a difference as it would seem. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Ranged attacks go through.<br />
Chaos Bolt goes through.<br />
Attacks that cannot be parried (like Overpower and old Frost Strike) goes through.<br />
Cheap Shot's tooltip doesn't say it but it cannot be dodged or parried either.<br />
Kidney Shot does not go through unless the hunter is already CC'd, same for Maim.<br />
Attacks that come from above supposedly goes through (think Holy Fire).<br />
Some AoE goes through but not all.<br />
<br />
Anything else is the result of latency.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also add DoTs and Paladin Judgements to the list.</div></div><hr />

Beastcleave came as a good thing in arena for hunters, but with a short 10 sec wrath it will not be nearly good enough... <br />
&quot;It now acts as a second PVP trinket&quot;.... ok... and?... <br />
So is that what &quot;Bestial Wrath&quot; is soposed to be? A button you will use to brake a fear or cyclone? Or is it something you would use for puting pressure on your target? <br />
<br />
God knows BM has not much in it's arsenal, with even less CC ability, it's BW as the only real ability that would force pressure and kill... <br />
But now, it is simply too short and can be either used at a VERRY well timed moment (like when the stars align) to actually drop something, or as a second PVP trinket (funny)... <br />
What hapens in the meantime, when the 10 sec wrath ends, since a 10 second BW is pretty much SHIT with a cooldown way to long for it's use now... ? Will the hunter use it's &quot;amazing&quot; arsenal of CC? (Ah right, the 1 trap)... Will he use his shitload of high burst shots? (Oh right, BM has none)... <br />
<br />
Half the duration of BW? Then half of the cooldown on it... Otherwise, you won't see a single one in the arenas, and they are not, nor will be respected enough to be seen as a real raiding spec... ALOT of work needs to be done here by the people in charge, who can't seem to get it right...</div></div><hr />

And as far as Ensidia goes they have skilled players but so does 20 other top guilds and they all have pretty much same gear setups aswell. So of course Ensidia gets competition and can be beaten by some other guilds.<br />
<br />
Everyone expected Ensidia to be the once killing first including themself, therefor they probably pushed the hardest they got to AnubArak as nr 1 and probably used up most of their tries quite fast due to the race to be number 1, while both Stars/Paragon took it just abit slower and even cleared 10 man heroic to get some time off AnubArak. If Ensidia would have taken it abit slower and not zerging they might been able to kill first reset aswell or not we'd never know.<br />
<br />
Too those that said that the instance is too easy we can just say that less than 1% of the total wow population will ever even get to AnubArak and even less than that will acutally be able to down him with equal gear as those guilds that has killed them now. Sure the normal mode is abit easy but on the other hand blizzard intended normal modes to be easier than before to open up content for more people while the heroic modes are meant for players that want more hardcore raiding.<br />
<br />
I think the instance is quite nicely done, its normal modes are quite nice giving alot casuals the chance to end game bosses. And the hard modes for me and my 10 man guild the hard modes in 10 man heroic is quite nice, its demanding and requires alot from most in the raid. And please dont come here with crap if your from a 25 man guild saying that 10 man is just way to easy, cause of course with 1k+ dps more on everyone of our dpsers we would faceroll it aswell but with 10 man ulduar gear and some upgrades from normal toc and emblems the raid requires focus.</div></div><hr />

PvP balance and Rewards<br />
We make balance changes for BG PvP all the time. We make fewer changes due to world PvP (I'm talking mostly about PvP servers) but those still exist.<br />
<br />
Most of the PvP discussions in these forums tend to focus on Arena balance because frankly that's what most of the participants here seem interested in discussing. If I had to guess, it's because you are constantly running into BG situations in which class balance makes very little difference, say the other team was smarter with how they handled the flags. Or maybe you just plain went up against 20 opponents at once, in which even our most naive posters don't really expect their 51-point talent or whatever to be able to save them. That's not to say you can't have interesting discussions about BG strategy or even BG balance issues... but that's not the purpose of these role forums. Perhaps Arenas just shine a harsher light on class balance than do BGs.<br />
We have acknowledged that we need to offer better PvP rewards for players who like BGs over Arenas. You shouldn't assume that means you can just AFK your way to epics though. You need to win a lot of BGs to get the best rewards. (Source)<br />

Sir, we have some disturbances in the Matrix. I cant believe my eyes. After almost 3 years of [insert random badword] arena, which totally wrecked up bg's and has often been influenced pve as well, they think about (i'm afraid to speak it out it loud) change? Yes, we can :D <br />
<br />
Edit: After changing my pants ... well done and grats to the firsts :)</div></div><hr />

I agree, but they did it first, and without INDEFINITE stun on the #1 raid killer in the encounter.<br />

<br />
huh? You call this a &quot;bad&quot; sign? It's just a little 10% dmg buff :/<br />

Now, look at Rogue's Assassination tree, the 51point talent Hunger For Blood /w glyph.<br />

Funny if locks would need a boost and they got a 10% dmg increase you would whine your ass off because they would be critting you for 16k<br />

<br />
<br />
Seriously Oggy, you need to calm down a bit. You were complaining about how much of a nerf this is for pvp.. well what about the fact that all BM hunters have Every Man For Himself and on a shorter CD timer too!! Thats an OP racial trait for 1 point. I'm not sure if the pvp trinket will go on cd when you pop beastial wrath and if it does, great you don't need that pvp trinket anymore, and if it doesn't you could have 2 pvp trinkets and pop them every single minute almost.<br />
<br />
I just can't understand how you would consider this a pvp nerf.. yes you lose 8 secs of bw, but you get an extra fricken pvp trinket (for you and your pet!) plus the additional dmg/mana reduction/cc reduction for 10 seconds.<br />
<br />
And just to be clear, I'm not writing this as an &quot;omfg hunter's will be op now&quot; I'm truly excited and am looking forward to this change for my hunter. BTW I wasn't excited when I first saw the change, but when they explained it would act as a pvp trinket, that totally sold me!</div></div><hr />

The only way Hunters are even slightly viable in PvP right now is with Beast Cleave, we have very little survivability and not much burst either, which are both fairly essential parts of PvP. You can go ahead and say &quot;but you guys have Deterrence&quot;, but that doesn't make as much of a difference as it would seem. <br />
<br />
Also add DoTs and Paladin Judgements to the list.<br />
<br />
<br />
i fully agree with you :&gt; I only played hunter to lvl 34 so dont know much about hunter my self. but in arena Hunters is normally being nuked pretty hard compared to other classes. The only class i can imagine being less protective is maybe Elemental shamans? :P but they are shit in pvp anyways..</div></div><hr />

People don't understand how to play the hunter class. If you consider running around kiting people and jumping around the frost trap as a skill, then you must be shit playing hunter. Deterrence works alright, It works if they don't attack you from behind. Spells, don't go through deterrence unless you don't turn your back to them. Its not the class thats the problem, their survivability is fine. You have a pet that can lock them down, You're burst is fine. You have an MS effect and traps and 1-2 CCs.</div></div><hr />

Why people care so much about this? it is quite simple, when you are claiming so hard that your guild is the best and has the best players in the world and also trying to make of their website a platform based on the fact that many people will visit it cause they are number one but they clearly got some serious competition and we are loving it.<br />
<br />
When Sk and Nuhilum merged most people thought this will make them unbeatable and they probably believed that themselfs as well, so they started to proclaim they were going for all world firsts. Honestly i think they were dreaming on this dream untill something really hard came up ( Yopggie 0 + Anub ) to show them they actually were not as good as they thought, cause 6 months of Naxx does not really count if u ask me. I must say that Ensidia downed Mimiron pretty fast, i believe 3 weeks ahead of the second guild who down him but that is all of the amazing Ensidia has really done. So hopefully more tough challenges will be out there of the level of yoggie and Anub to prove who really is number 1.<br />

<br />
They couldn't implement the Argent Tourney rep transfers but they could swap your mounts, your other reps, even swap which faction heads you've killed -- but there's some nebulous, mystical, unsolvable technical issue that prevented them swapping the AT reps?<br />
<br />
Sorry, not buying it.<br />
<br />
No idea what the real reason is, but the reason cited is bullshit.<br />
<br />
Now those of us that transferred get to either grind 28 days (minimum) to get our AT reps back, or just say screw it and do without. Neither of which appeals.<br />
<br />
Great job Blizzard! Considering how much work went into the rest of the transfer to make it seamless, and it mostly was, considering what a great job they did with everything else, this one thing makes no sense and is like having a burr stuck in a sensitive area. =)</div></div><hr />

Makes me wonder why people really care at all about world firsts. How about caring what YOUR guild does and how fast they do it, but most importantly HOW they do it?</div></div><hr />
