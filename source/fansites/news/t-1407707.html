I like the game as it is... I don't know much about him but I've read a lot of his tweets and blue posts.... I don't want him to leave :/ <br />

The truth - one person does not define a hundred person development team, especially with a fairly flat hierarchy and multiple 'leads' (of which GC was only one lead).</div></div><hr />

Do you honestly think he makes every decision alone? No. He was the face of the development team and took the blows from the fans for everyone who helped make decisions about the game.<br />
<br />
I met him at BlizzCon and he is honestly one of the nicest people I've ever met. I will be very sad to see him go, because, believe it or not people, he has done a LOT of good for this game with his team of developers.</div></div><hr />

Yes, he made some hard choices, but he isn't the SOLE person behind everything..... Someone else will be the face of blizzard who tells us about nerfs/buffs and the reasons behind them and like sheep, you will say &quot;OMG fire this guy already he sucks&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
Too sudden and too big of a change.<br />
<br />
He was a good guy. He lead the game through the best and worst times, and always tried (Not always successfully, but tried) to explain to the players why certain changes were made and why they believe they are good for the game.<br />
<br />
Now, the player reactions? I can completely understand why he'd leave if given a better opportunity. I'm sure he was dying for it, honestly.</div></div><hr />

Tbh, I dnt see how this is a huge issue, Blizz team are good enough without him, and unless he's going to develop some massive MMO with some pro team, I don't think it'll have that much of an effect on WoW, and I think this is probably gnna be a bad choice for him tbh.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But, new blood is good. The current batch of WoW designers really needs to be shaken up, because while they do some great things, they have a LOT of ingrained ideas about what WoW can and can't do that are causing some serious stagnation.<br />
<br />
Time for some new ideas.<br />
<br />
The best thing you could do for WoW is to get rid of a few more of the old-timers.<br />

Seriously.<br />

Lets see who his successor is. I'm sure all of you guys will approve immediately! /sarcasm<br />
<br />
I'm not saying I'm a GC supporter, or anything, but I can definitely tell you that he, like his successor, is a company man who was towing the company line. No matter who has the unenviable job of being Lead System Designer, they will always have their bosses they answer to, and ultimately will make decisions you don't like. Gonna have to deal with that, kiddies, because the next guy will make decisions that you won't like too.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Guys, I have a great idea. The best way to get more players and keep them playing is to exclude 95% of them from EVERY seeing the majority of endgame content! They'll keep subscribing to not play anything we put in patches amidst the plethora of new and more approachable MMOs that have flooded the market in the last decade!&quot;<br />

I doubt that the game will change a lot but if Mr. Street is happy about where he's headed then good for him. If someone new with a fresh perspective takes his place that's potentially a good thing too. The problem is that if Blizzard moves someone into the lead system designer seat from in house that won't be much like new perspectives and bringing someone in from outside means that he/she will take a long time to get their head around everything involved.<br />

Anyway, best of luck to all and we'll just have to hope that it all works out in the best possible way for everyone.</div></div><hr />

Woah I... that was out of left field. I assumed Gregory was in for the long haul. Not sure how to feel, he's done good, he's done bad, and ugly too. Hope his 'better opportunity' is worth the move, since for all the abuse he receives this feels like abdicating the throne.<br />

Good grief do you remember what it was even LIKE before wrath? Balancing all the classes and specs in WoW and maintaining class unique talents and skills, is a task right up there with combing a beach for a specific grain of sand. Bloody impossible, but he gave it everything and for the most part you can use pretty much any spec to compete to a point.<br />

So yeah, we ARE playing the game. Have you been?</div></div><hr />

If he was just the mouthpiece for someone else that's responsible for funneling the feedback into some useful product, then things won't change and people will still be ignored until there are big unsubs associated with the changes that go poorly despite community warnings. <br />
<br />
I don't think much will change, because I don't really think he was ever speaking for the whole game development team and process, but who knows. Maybe now things will go back to Wrath style where the game was a whole lot of fun for everyone. Maybe it's too late for the next expansion and another 2-3 mil will unsub and the game will quickly shift to F2P with the fun in-game store, who knows?</div></div><hr />

The best way to get more players and keep them playing is to exclude 95% of them from EVERY seeing the majority of endgame content! They'll keep subscribing to not play anything we put in patches amidst the plethora of new and more approachable MMOs that have flooded the market in the last decade!&quot;<br />

<br />
GC has never acted alone, he's always been part of a team, and whilst that team is still largely intact things will progress in much the same vein, for better or worse. If his replacement isn't up to the job things could very easily fall apart.<br />
<br />
GC went above and beyond what was required of him as far as communicating with players went, I'll miss that. <br />

I wish him well, and thank him for the effort he has put into the game.</div></div><hr />

I've no friggin clue what time in the past people remember classes as being as &quot;balanced&quot; as they are now. They certainly weren't balanced in vanilla (that was laughably poor balance) or BC, or WotLK... Didn't start getting good till just recently. <br />
<br />
In addition, things like LFR and the like, even if people &quot;hate&quot; them, aren't going anywhere... And no way in hell were they &quot;his&quot; decision alone to make. <br />
<br />
But hey, no one ever accused the GC haters of having rational arguments. I doubt I'll even get a response to this; all they do is knee-jerk.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Woah I... that was out of left field. I assumed Gregory was in for the long haul. Not sure how to feel, he's done good, he's done bad, and ugly too. Hope his 'better opportunity' is worth the move, since for all the abuse he receives this feels like abdicating the throne.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Good grief do you remember what it was even LIKE before wrath? Balancing all the classes and specs in WoW and maintaining class unique talents and skills, is a task right up there with combing a beach for a specific grain of sand. Bloody impossible, but he gave it everything and for the most part you can use pretty much any spec to compete to a point.<br />
<br />
So yeah, we ARE playing the game. Have you been?<br />
<br />
You keep telling yourself that, skippy. The game has never been and never will be &quot;balanced&quot;. Even if everyone had the same hp, mana, and all our abilities did the exact same damage, some terrible player would get his ass handed to him by some other class and lead the charge to have said class nerfed. And please, tell us all how all classes can &quot;compete&quot;.....2 of the three lock specs are almost dead last, beating out only shadow priest, and shadowpriest is 36k behind top dps......or around 25% behind. So yeah, you don't have a clue what you're talking about. And as for PvP.....well just lulz......tell us again how everyone in every spec can &quot;compete&quot;.....if that were the case, there would not be carbon copy arena teams at the top of the ladders.</div></div><hr />

He is too strongly associated with the decline of things I liked about the game - server communities, single 25m raiding tier, hard baseline content, etc. I doubt much will change. But if anything I am curious to know whether he really moved on, or got fired.</div></div><hr />
