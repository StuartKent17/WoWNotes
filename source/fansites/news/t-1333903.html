Patch 5.4 - Tier 16 Warlock Armor Set<br />
Keep in mind that this is just a preview and the final set may be different.<br />

Patch 5.4 Developer Interviews<br />
There were several interviews with the developers last week and a lot more coming this week! You can find information from previous interviews on our Patch 5.4 Developer Interviews page (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/1345).<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Mamytwink (http://www.mamytwink.com/actualite/interview-exclusive-de-cory-stockton-pour-mamytwink-com)<br />
<br />
The devs are happy with how the legendary item system worked out, and Cory wouldn't be surprised to see them continue with the same kind of system. However, this doesn't mean they won't do legendary items the old way ever again.<br />
The future of the in game store items that appeared in the store is uncertain. Those kind of items may be popular in Asia, but may not be very popular in the US/EU. They will only be added if it feels right for the game and is the right thing to do, so the items may not even make it into the game.<br />
There aren't any plans for class specific quests in the near future.<br />
Achievements will be the only reward for Proving Grounds, as they are mostly aimed at learning new specs or challenging yourself. They are fun on their own.<br />
The DotA Battleground could happen, but may never happen. It isn't being worked on anymore (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/367777472386838528).<br />
There will be a smaller pre-expansion event patch, but anything beyond that is not set in stone. Patch 5.4 is the conclusion of the Pandaria storyline.<br />
Battlefield: Barrens was pretty successful and the developers were happy with the outcome.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
The Instance (http://theinstance.net/2013/08/interview-with-cory-stockton/)<br />
<br />
The tech is in place to be able to change how flex encounters work for each additional player that is in the raid. Some things like NPC health or damage scale well and can easily be changed per player, but generally things that don't scale well like the number of adds just change for every few people that are added to the raid.<br />
Removing the item level restriction on enchants was done to make the process of preparing an item for use simpler, eliminating one of the research steps that needed to be done. <br />
Proving Grounds will give players an opportunity to try other specs and see if they enjoy them without impacting other players. By the time you have gone through to gold with a spec, you should be ready to queue up for things and play decently. <br />
Proving Grounds has a lot of potential and can be expanded upon if it is well received by players.<br />
Garrosh has been built up over several expansions from a smaller character to the final raid boss of an expansion. Arthas was cool, but people already knew a lot about him because he was from Warcraft III. For the final raid boss, the developers want players to really want to kill him. This requires players to know what he has done in the past and why you are here killing him. The team has worked hard to explain over the past few patches what Garrosh is doing to Pandaria, why it is so bad, and what his plans are for the Horde. <br />
It was a tough decision to destroy the Vale permanently in Patch 5.4 rather than doing it as a phase or part of the raid only, but it really adds to the impact of the patch.<br />
<br />

<br />
WoWCrendor (http://www.youtube.com/user/wowcrendor?feature=watch)<br />
<br />
Timeless Isle is intended for exploration, looking for rare spawns, and taking place in events, so there are only 2 daily quests (http://ptr.wowdb.com/quests/pandaria/timeless-isle?filter-daily=1&amp;filter-patch=3388&amp;filter-lvl-min=90) on the island. It should feel less like a grind than anything that has been added recently. <br />
One of the downsides of the new talent system is that it is challenging to provide something new and rewarding every time someone levels. On the upside, the decision process for returning players is much easier and the choices everyone makes are more meaningful. <br />
Passive talents that gave you something like 1% hit just weren't exciting or interesting, especially as they had almost no impact on the leveling process.<br />
Connected Realms has been in development for a very long time. They could have just merged servers in the past, but that wouldn't have been the right solution for the game. <br />
Connected Realms is a big piece of tech for WoW and it will grow and get more features over time.<br />
As far as future additions to the pet battle system, the system may not need more qualities, pet levels, or changes to the core dynamics. <br />
People enjoy pet battles as they are, so in the future more content will be added. This includes more pets, pets with unique abilities that are strong against new pet trainers, more pets from bosses, more pet battle quest lines, and other content. <br />

Gamona (http://wow.gamona.de/mists-of-pandaria/patch-5-4-interview-greg-street-de/)<br />
<br />
Trinkets that relied on the ICD were becoming boring, so RPPM was an attempt to make trinket procs a little bit more random and interesting. <br />
The changes made to RPPM and Haste will hopefully address the issue of procs on pull and other issues with the new mechanic.<br />
Casting while moving is a complex problem, as the game works better when there is less casting while moving, but being inactive when movement is required is a problem as well. Allowing players to do lower damage while moving is a decent solution to the problem.<br />
The developers will watch carefully and make sure that Flex does not feel too mandatory.<br />
The heirloom weapons on Garrosh are a reason for players to keep coming back and killing him, even when a new expansion is approaching. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
WoWInsider (http://wow.joystiq.com/2013/08/16/patch-5-4-flexible-raids-dailies-and-more-with-tom-chilton/)<br />
<br />
Removing the daily quest cap made players feel like that doing all of the daily quests available was mandatory.<br />
Daily quests may return in the future, but not to the extent of the Patch 5.0 daily quest options.<br />
Permanently damaging the Vale was the right thing to do and addressed the concerns of players that want a more dynamic world. Phasing wasn't practical because of how the zone was initially designed.<br />
Patch 5.4 won't show the results of the ongoing war in the world, but there is an event between 5.4 and the next expansion.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Blizzplanet (http://www.blizzplanet.com/blog/comments/blizzplanet-interview-cory-stockton-discusses-patch-5-4-siege-of-orgrimmar)<br />
<br />
There might be some changes made to Orgrimmar over time, but there won't be any dramatic changes right away.<br />
Players aren't directed to everything on the Timeless Isle via daily quests so that there is more of a sense of exploration and discovery. <br />
The Timeless Isle armor being looted in a random way from chests is a departure from the normal slow grind towards a guaranteed item to go along with the other new things being tried on the isle. <br />

Raid Lag<br />
This is some pretty awesome sleuthing here, great work! We've been doing some similar testing over the past couple of weeks and we agree -- it looks like healing is the culprit of the dreaded &quot;raid lag&quot; that many guilds have been experiencing.<br />
<br />
We do have a few adjustments coming down the pipe for 5.4 that should help. We're changing AoE heals to no longer affect insignificant guardians like Voodoo Gnomes or Wild Imps. We're also making a few adjustments to Healing Rain, Light's Hammer, Spinning Crane Kick, and Holy Word: Sanctuary that should hopefully clean things up a bit as well. Plus, now that we know the source of the issue, it'll be easier to make further adjustments if necessary.<br />
<br />
Thanks again for putting so much effort into testing this! (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/266691-debugging-raid-lag-in-25s/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/9679038602?page=2#25))<br />

Patch 5.4 Hunter Changes<br />
1. There would be compensation for the removal of readiness; can you clarify. <br />
We've already made all of the adjustments we had planned in the wake of the Readiness nerf. Yes, this means that you'll be less effective in certain situations (such as BM burst in Arenas). That was the point.<br />
<br />
2. It was acknowledged that Hunter DPS was low and that this would be specifically addressed<br />
We're still monitoring performance and tuning appropriately, and that will continue. It's important to remember that changes to other classes will have an effect on where you stand in overall performance. Comparing 5.4 PTR Hunter DPS to, say, 5.3 Fire Mage DPS would be silly, as Fire has been brought down considerably.<br />
<br />
3. It was promised that there would be work done to make significant differentiation between all three Hunter specs<br />
Indeed, that's something we're planning to do; and as I mentioned when I first brought it up, that'll happen sometime after 5.4.<br />
<br />
4. MM was to be made viable again, or at least on par with the other specs<br />
I haven't said anything along these lines, but keeping similar specs in line with each other is always a goal of ours. That said, players will always tend to gravitate towards whatever the &quot;best&quot; spec happens to be in a given patch cycle, even if the differences are very minor. If Survival ends up doing even as little as 2% more damage than Marksmanship, I suspect we'll still see many claims that Marks is &quot;not viable.&quot;<br />
<br />
5. Our mechanics (things like pet patching and glitching) would be addressed (edit: this has been pushed off)<br />
I thought I was pretty clear when I brought this up initially: there is no blanket fix to pet pathing. The vast majority of the time, it has to do with how an encounter functions or how an environment is built, and nothing to do with the pet AI at all. The issues aren't unfixable, but we need to know specifically when and where your pets are struggling. &quot;Fix pet pathing&quot; doesn't help us (or you).

<br />
<br />
Raid Testing Schedule - August 20<br />
On Tuesday, August 20, we will continue testing raid encounters in the Siege of Orgrimmar raid. <br />
<br />
Each encounter should be available at approximately the listed times below for all Public Test Realms.<br />
<br />
Tuesday, August 20<br />
<br />
Immerseus - 25 Player Normal - 10:30 PDT (13:30 EDT, 19:30 CEST)<br />
Siegecrafter Blackfuse - 25 Player Normal - 12:00 PDT (15:00 EDT, 21:00 CEST)<br />
Spoils of Pandaria - 25 Player Normal - 13:30 PDT (16:30 EDT, 22:30 CEST)<br />
Paragons of the Klaxxi- 25 Player Normal - 15:00 PDT (18:00 EDT, 24:00 CEST)<br />
<br />
<br />
As always, this testing schedule is very fluid and subject to the realities of a beta environment. We might have to change the time of a testing session, change the boss being tested, or cancel a test entirely, due to bugs, server hardware issues, etc. Keep an eye on this forum for the latest information, and thank you in advance for testing and providing feedback.<br />
<br />
<br />
Website Cleanup Update<br />
Thanks to everyone who provided feedback on our earlier website-cleanup plan announcement. We read through all of your thoughts and suggestions, and based on that we’re making a number of changes to our initial plan. While our goal remains to clean up parts of the website that require frequent updates but don’t see a lot of traffic, we heard some great reasons to keep specific sections around, and in some cases we've come up with creative solutions to make that happen.<br />
<br />
Features Being Retired or Changed<br />
Game Guide<br />
<br />
Pets &amp; Mounts Gallery<br />
<br />
You’ll still be able to browse/show off individual character collections, but we’ll leave catalogues of all available pets to fan sites like Warcraft Pets or Wowhead.<br />
<br />
<br />
Factions<br />
This will be replaced with a general overview of what factions are.<br />
Professions<br />
Profession pages will remain, but we will be removing the item lists.<br />
Guild Profiles<br />
Perks and Rewards sections This list will be gone, but you can still check them out in-game.<br />
<br />
Features Staying<br />
Character Profiles<br />
<br />
Pets &amp; Mounts<br />
Hunter Pets<br />
<br />
You’ll still be able to look at Hunter pet stables.<br />
We will be removing the Hunter pet talent information showing how each pet is specced.<br />
<br />
Professions<br />
Reputations<br />
Reputation lists and tracking for characters will remain.<br />
Individual faction pages will link to Wowhead and Wowpedia.<br />
<br />
<br />
One common question we heard after the previous announcement was whether these changes would affect the website API, which is largely how fansites access data about the game and characters for use on their own pages. These changes in no way affect the API—they only affect the information we’re choosing to display on the official site. We’re committed to providing all of the site-builders out there with tools they need to make their WoW resources great, and we plan to keep providing them with the same level of API information and support.<br />
<br />
Thanks again for all of your feedback, and for helping us ensure the World of Warcraft website continues to provide you with the information you seek.<br />
<br />

Weekly News Recap<br />
Another very busy week full of news, so here is your chance to catch up! <br />
<br />
<br />
August 11<br />
<br />
We looked at the Tier 16 Hunter Armor Set (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3336-Tier-16-Hunter-Flex-Difficulty-Feedback-Blue-Tweets-Setup-of-the-Month-News-Recap).<br />
The Setup of the Month (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3336-Tier-16-Hunter-Flex-Difficulty-Feedback-Blue-Tweets-Setup-of-the-Month-News-Recap) was posted.<br />
The target audience of Flex Raids was described (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/266125-feedback-the-underhold-flexible/#post33).<br />
<br />
August 12<br />
<br />
Ghostcrawler was interviewed (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3337-Coffee-with-the-Devs-Dissecting-Patch-5-4-Class-Changes) by Twizzcast.<br />
<br />
The heirloom weapons (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3333-5-4-Heirloom-Raid-Weapons-5-4-Notes-Update-SoO-Raid-Testing-Blue-Tweets-HS-Update) that drop from Garrosh are personal loot in Flex, Normal, and Heroic difficulty. The first heirloom weapon that drops for you will be for your current loot spec, but after that you will get one at random.<br />
Scenarios might be a useful place to apply the Flex scaling tech in the future, scaling from 3 to 5 players.<br />
The idea of scaling raids past 25 players has also been considered, allowing you to scale up to a higher limit like 30 players.<br />
<br />
A summary of the intent behind the Patch 5.4 class changes (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/266195-dev-watercooler-dissecting-patch-54-class-changes/) was posted.<br />
<br />
August 13<br />
<br />
There was a PTR build that added a new Cosmetic set for Shaman only (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3338-Patch-5-4-PTR-Build-17299).<br />
A trademark application (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3339-Blizzard-Trademarks-The-Dark-Below-WoW-or-D3-Expansion) for The Dark Below appeared, but was never filed, as no serial number was assigned.<br />
<br />
August 14<br />
<br />
The Battle.Net Desktop Client entered open beta (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3340-Questions-for-the-Devs-BNet-Client-Beta-5-4-on-BG-Downloader-S13-Ending-Soon-DLC).<br />
Patch 5.4 went on the background downloader (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2013/august/54BackgroundDownloader.jpg).<br />
A potential Patch 5.4 release date (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/367401124296273920) of the 27th was posted. <br />
The end of Season 13 (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/266240-pvp-season-13-ending-soon/) was announced.<br />
The Reaper of Souls Diablo III expansion teaser (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3341-Diablo-3-s-next-expansion-is-named-Reaper-of-Souls) appeared on the official site.<br />
<br />
August 15<br />
<br />
The Patch 5.4 trailer was released (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3344-Patch-5-4-Siege-of-Orgrimmar-Trailer-Unleashed)!<br />
The official Patch 5.4 PTR notes were updated (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3343-Patch-5-4-Notes-Update-Launcher-Update-Battlefield-Barrens-Ending-Patch-5-4-Blogs) with lots of class changes.<br />
The Battle.Net Desktop Client open beta was officially announced (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/266324-launcher-update-get-the-desktop-app-for-battlenet-now/).<br />
An end to Battlefield: Barrens (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/266370-battlefield-barrens-ending-soon/) was announced.<br />
A preview of the changes to the Vale (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/266373-patch-54-destruction-of-the-vale-of-eternal-blossoms/) and a preview of the Timeless Isle (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/266323-the-timeless-isletake-your-time/) were posted.<br />
<br />
August 16<br />
<br />
The Hearthstone Closed Beta went live (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3347-Hearthstone-Beta-Now-Live!)!<br />
We had the opportunity to interview Tom Chilton (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3345-Tom-Chilton-Interview-Shaman-Cosmetic-Armor-Raid-Testing-Blue-Posts-BG-Downloader) about Patch 5.4 and beyond. There is a lot of interesting stuff in the interview, so please read the full thing!<br />
<br />
The Kor'kron Dark Shaman cosmetic armor (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items?filter-patch=3388&amp;filter-search=Kor%27kron+Dark+Shaman) will drop off of mobs in Flex, Normal, and Heroic difficulty Siege of Orgrimmar. The armor already existed for NPCs, so adding it is a cool bonus for Shaman. We may see more in the future if a similar situation arises.<br />
Normal difficulty raids and scenarios are good candidates for applying the Flex tech to in the future, but Normal raids are tuned tighter than Flex, so this isn't a promise at all.<br />
There will be some kind of content and event between now and the next expansion, but the patch number isn't determined yet.<br />
Connected Realms will be used to help out lower population realms, not balance the factions on very high population realms. However, in the process of grouping low population realms, faction balance will be taken into account as much as possible.<br />
Connected Realms will roll out fairly quickly after Patch 5.4 is released, similar to the release timeline of Cross-Realm Zones.<br />
There may not be any realm specific things like achievements, leaderboards, or forums going forward.<br />
<br />
<br />
August 18<br />
<br />
There was another PTR build (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3349-Patch-5-4-PTR-Build-17314-Blue-Tweets-Fan-Art) with a few class changes.</div></div><hr />

Agreed. It definitely feels rewarding. And I personally don't mind it being accessible by a lot of people. Back in Wrath I was the last in line for Shadowmourne (New member, and I did more DPS than those with it anyway) and it feels nicer to be able to get a legendary without the whole 'Pick a number' stuff along with the amount of QQ and drama. <br />
<br />
Other than that, I REALLY hope they add a lot more of the Timeless Isle's concept into the game. And I welcome their decision on altering the Vale. It's always good when the surrounding areas do a 180 and look completely different.</div></div><hr />

I just wish it wasn't such a freakin' eye sore. Gonna have to be staring at it for the rest of the expansion... I mean, if they tore up some random section of townlong steppes permenantly, I wouldn't care. But this is like putting the blown-to-hell park in the middle of Stormwind. <br />
<br />
If ONE positive thing were to come of it, it'd be removing that one damn music sting that ALWAYS plays when you cross over into the vale.</div></div><hr />

Also, as for the &quot;No plans for any class specific quests&quot; I really hope they do in the future have more class specific quests. The warlock one is really fun, and with an amazing reward. For other classes, we just have the low level &quot;Kill 10 rats, collect 5 twigs&quot; for the okayish weapon/helm models. Thunder warrior, flame druid (though it's time passed if it was going to be implemented) or some other cool natury aesthetic, Crimson paladin light, ect. Lots of cosmetic ideas to make classes feel cooler. As well as raid dropped class transmog, which is an idea I hope they continue with. <br />
<br />
Oh, and as for the veil and them wanting to make the world progress and all. Yeah that's fine, but it will stay like that probably forever, even when canonically the sha of pride is defeated and the Shado-pan and golden lotus purify the veil. If i'm correct, SW still looks mangled from DW, and there are countless other structures that are only half completed. (off topic, anyone else think that human structures take forever to build?)</div></div><hr />

IF only they made secrets and runestones drop 50 -75% after you get legendary on 1 character.<br />
This system works against alts, hate doing lfrs just because i have to. (first time was great, but its dumb for alts)<br />
And you &quot;Have to&quot; to stay competitive - you can't just ignore it or you loose raid spot cause of low damage.<br />
<br />
Yes, it feels good to finally get legendary after all that time, BUT.. ONLY first time.<br />
There are many reasons to switch class this late in expansion - one of them is to stay competitive.(some classess just do 10-30% less damage on some fights - hunters for example). Blizzard refuse to fix our scaling issues, we are keep loosing raidspots - and even legendary chain stays in our way - we can't just switch class and do competitive numbers - have to farm legendary for months first.<br />
<br />
Doing legendary chain 2nd time is really frustrating. <br />
Why can't we have 100% dropchance from msv(5.0 content), when it's 5.3 already? Like valour buff when you cap it on 1 character.<br />
Same goes for valors - 3k this late(almost 5.4) is too much. Make it 1k after you got it on 1 character.<br />
50-75% from tot(curent content).<br />
<br />
ONLY after you finish quest chain on one character. <br />
<br />
First time should stay as it is - to feel epic. It really does. <br />
But 2nd time does not feel that way anymore - it is just booring and dumb quest chain. Feels dumb, when you have done it already - now have to do it all once more for 2-4 months..<br />
<br />
2nd time is really bad design for alts/some raiders, who &quot;have to&quot; switch class this late.<br />
And there ARE many reasons to switch class. It's not just fotm.</div></div><hr />

If you wanted your 200 points, the only way to get it was kill 200 easy mobs. The event itself was fine, but the rewards were such a narrow niche that very few people actually needed them, and once people stopped going, then most of the actual events couldn´t be done... the only thing you could do was kill 200 easy mobs for 1 armor piece per week.<br />

Are you seriously complaining about having to grind the legendary for your alts? I mean, at least you have the option now to do it on your alts and that's enough already. <br />
<br />
Also, you don't have to have a bunch of geared alts to be competitive on the game. Any guild that requires that is either a top 100 guild (and if you are on a top 100 guild you shouldn't be complaining about having to devote time to the game), or a bunch of wannabes.</div></div><hr />

They could have just merged servers in the past, but that wouldn't have been the right solution for the game.*<br />
<br />
And they think players don't get that this is BS? The connected realms are nothing else than merged servers. We players won't even KNOW if there are still muliple servers around or if blizz just pretends that we are on different servers that are connected. Given that the game tells us that servers with 12 players logged in are on &quot;middle&quot; status....I would not believe a word of what blizz says when it comes to servers.<br />
<br />
<br />
*The DotA Battleground could happen, but may never happen. It isn't being worked on anymore.*<br />
<br />
Always interesting to see how they scrap the most interesting features without of a serious public notice. Guess this would have needed some real work...rather give us another 500 pets.<br />
<br />
<br />
*As far as future additions to the pet battle system, the system may not need more qualities, pet levels, or changes to the core dynamics.<br />
People enjoy pet battles as they are, so in the future more content will be added. This includes more pets, pets with unique abilities that are strong against new pet trainers, more pets from bosses, more pet battle quest lines, and other content.*<br />
<br />
Yay, more copies of the same pet. Great. 500 pets ain't enough, right? The truth is: It's easier to just throw another 500 meaningless pets into the game and sell it as &quot;new content&quot;...just to keep people busy. <br />
<br />
<br />
*Casting while moving is a complex problem, as the game works better when there is less casting while moving, but being inactive when movement is required is a problem as well. Allowing players to do lower damage while moving is a decent solution to the problem.*<br />
<br />
Then screw the other classes over just like they did with shadows already for years. <br />
They know that being stuck in a place when movement is required sucks big time...but still they exclusively force shadows exactly in that position.</div></div><hr />

That, or they realized how stupid easy it is to play three games (with no requisite to win) and changed the reward to something much more reasonable. <br />

<br />
So now we know why hunters don't get much attention. They wait to see how the changes they make to other classes affects where hunters fall in the dps chart. And then they still don't change hunters but wait to see how further changes affect where we end up on the charts? I wonder if they have thought of making MM the pvp spec for hunters and developing its output around that the way they made frost the mage pvp spec. Oh, wait, they would have to wait to see how the changes they make to frost mages affects where the MM hunters fall on the dps charts, wouldn't they?<br />
<br />
I'm a little tired of the &quot;we like where hunters are&quot; which we learned the other day is the developers looking at how many hunters are being played and not how they are doing or being represented in raids. And now we get the &quot;hunters output will depend on how they compare to mages, etc.&quot; viewpoint which is a horrible way to look at the output of a class in my opinion.</div></div><hr />

Did it look like I was kidding? Do I really need to lay it out for you?<br />
<br />
For finding 15-30 other players and wiping over and over and having to organize a guild and everything that comes with it you get a few ilvls on your gear which looks exactly the same.<br />
For finding 4 others willing to do challenge modes with you and your group having to wipe many times to go through them (which also requires potions, flasks and feasts) you get a few cosmetic items while for doing piss easy heroics that you can solo by now you get about the same except for a mount and a transmog set but you also get rare items and more gold (mobs in CM don't drop anything).<br />
<br />
Are you being serious? Or maybe you don't understand how much time and effort is involved into that challenging content?<br />
<br />
And now they again add challenging content that has no rewards at all. I also forgot Brawlers guild with it's cosmetic rewards but I guess those two are solo so it's not a big deal. But the way he said it, if something is challenging that is a reward on it's own... sounds like a joke to me.<br />

Everyone progressing through raiding is able to do well in challenge modes. I gave challenge mode a try during a weekend with some guildies and managed to get 4-5 golds no problems. Challenge mode are challenging and fun, but heroic raiding (and even normal when is the current content) is a completely different matter and requires way more effort in terms of organisationand time.<br />

I honestly don't see the point... You can decide to progress your character through different contents, if you pve you'll get pve gear that is usefull for your pve career. You can go PvP and get rewarded with pvp stuff. <br />
If you want to go through challenging stuff that is not supposed to be current content you will only get those cosmetic rewards like mounts/titles/achi points/pets, like 95% of the current game content. <br />
That's how I see it, why are you obsessed with having a reward for being better than someone else? You know you are, do you really need to show off?</div></div><hr />

Just wanted to state that for me, personally, this was not the case, it gave me a choice of which ones I wanted to do. Granted, until I was maxed out on Rep I did as many as I could, but rarely did I do them all even then. Just wanted to state, as a player, this was not how I felt at all. I felt liberated and told &quot;We trust you to make the right decision for your play style&quot; and I appreciated the gesture.<br />

<br />
For finding 15-30 other players and wiping over and over and having to organize a guild and everything that comes with it you get a few ilvls on your gear which looks exactly the same.<br />
For finding 4 others willing to do challenge modes with you and your group having to wipe many times to go through them (which also requires potions, flasks and feasts) you get a few cosmetic items while for doing piss easy heroics that you can solo by now you get about the same except for a mount and a transmog set but you also get rare items and more gold (mobs in CM don't drop anything).<br />
<br />
Are you being serious? Or maybe you don't understand how much time and effort is involved into that challenging content?<br />
<br />
And now they again add challenging content that has no rewards at all. I also forgot Brawlers guild with it's cosmetic rewards but I guess those two are solo so it's not a big deal. But the way he said it, if something is challenging that is a reward on it's own... sounds like a joke to me.<br />
<br />
Funny thing is barely anyone will agree or care because the vast majority is &quot;unable&quot; to do challenging content.<br />
<br />
Not to mention that the so called better gear from heroic raiding is worse than next flex mode...<br />
<br />
One of the reasons for trying to get all that gear is to get some &quot;advantage&quot; on the next tier while waiting for good RNGs on loot drop. Being worse than the lowest dificult (LFR isn't raiding, sry, also there is no &quot;dificult&quot; on something that was designed to be 100% beaten) of the next tier is... no words.<br />

<br />
I get it, but we have titles and mounts for the &quot;Glory of whatever raiding&quot; meta to display when they still are rare, achievements for every single heroic kill, FoS for beating the current normal and heroic content. There's plenty of showing off material IMO.<br />
I agree that going into a new tier of raiding resetting your gear progression feels a bit cheap and unfair, but if you are good you'll be on top again at the end of the upcoming tier... that's a challange too.</div></div><hr />

This system works against alts, hate doing lfrs just because i have to. (first time was great, but its dumb for alts)<br />
And you &quot;Have to&quot; to stay competitive - you can't just ignore it or you loose raid spot cause of low damage.<br />
<br />
Yes, it feels good to finally get legendary after all that time, BUT.. ONLY first time.<br />
There are many reasons to switch class this late in expansion - one of them is to stay competitive.(some classess just do 10-30% less damage on some fights - hunters for example). Blizzard refuse to fix our scaling issues, we are keep loosing raidspots - and even legendary chain stays in our way - we can't just switch class and do competitive numbers - have to farm legendary for months first.<br />
<br />
Doing legendary chain 2nd time is really frustrating. <br />
Why can't we have 100% dropchance from msv(5.0 content), when it's 5.3 already? Like valour buff when you cap it on 1 character.<br />
Same goes for valors - 3k this late(almost 5.4) is too much. Make it 1k after you got it on 1 character.<br />
50-75% from tot(curent content).<br />
<br />
ONLY after you finish quest chain on one character. <br />
<br />
First time should stay as it is - to feel epic. It really does. <br />
But 2nd time does not feel that way anymore - it is just booring and dumb quest chain. Feels dumb, when you have done it already - now have to do it all once more for 2-4 months..<br />
<br />
2nd time is really bad design for alts/some raiders, who &quot;have to&quot; switch class this late.<br />
And there ARE many reasons to switch class. It's not just fotm.<br />
A friend of mine who raids in a serious guild has 3 alts with the epic cloak waiting to finish the chain. If you were half serious you would have been so far aswell. And no blizz should not make it easier. Did you have access to multiple shadowmournes or valanirs back in wotlk? Well, if not there is no reason to start now if you don't want to be patient and put in effort.</div></div><hr />

<br />
One of the downsides of the new talent system is that it is challenging to provide something new and rewarding every time someone levels. On the upside, the decision process for returning players is much easier and the choices everyone makes are more meaningful.<br />
<br />
<br />
They should add a separate parallel talent &quot;tree&quot; next to our current talents for levelling.<br />
<br />
It would be similar to the old talents and every level you get points to fill it up. The talents would be mundane stuff like +damage to this attack, +hit, ... etc. stuff that are currently automatically increased.<br />
<br />
At level cap, the whole tree will be filled. So there will be no changes to balance.<br />
<br />
Not much real choice, but it does give the illusion of choice and progression.<br />
<br />
Exactly. They should have left the old talent system, give us the illusion that we're choosing things to progress our character and then just put the new talent choices in on top of that. It's like they've never played an rpg game before. Leveling up and choosing upgrades is the best part.</div></div><hr />

Yeah there is,, either give us a pet free spec or talent or make a ranged pet. Pet free means you dont even need to worry about it and ranged means the pet will just hang out near the hunter like a water elemental or imp which dont really have pathing problems.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would have been more satisified if there were no legendary items at all. The system as it exists in MoP is just another attunement, something that is less a boost for doing it than a penalty for not doing it. The boost it provides will be countered by compensating increases in the difficulty of the raid content, so the design doesn't actually make you any more capable at doing the content that would be provided to you. What it DOES do is increase the spread in player capabilities, make it more difficult to level alts, and make it harder to get back into raiding if you come in late.<br />
<br />
Overall, the legendary system is just not worth all the negatives that come along with it.</div></div><hr />

well maybe you shouldnt have dumbed down the talent trees so much, i dnt find the level 90 deathknight talents meaningful at all which ever you pick gorefiends grasp is only good with the moonkins pull back move in rated bg's. remorseless winter sucks, and desercrated ground was removed at one point in the game and it comes back as a 90 talent no wonder your games losing subs cos its fast becoming warcraft my first MMO you will find it next to the my little ponys and power rangers at your local toy store! seriously blizzard blues have no idea what there talking about and these dev interviews are pointless its more carrot on a stick bullshit with answers like soon,maybe, we will see and we dnt have the resources for that</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also, you don't have to have a bunch of geared alts to be competitive on the game. Any guild that requires that is either a top 100 guild (and if you are on a top 100 guild you shouldn't be complaining about having to devote time to the game), or a bunch of wannabes.<br />
<br />
It isn't an Option though if you read what they do your guild would almost MAKE you get it unless they want to be held back. It isn't that huge of a deal but it is a notable difference. I'm not sure if you have too much time on your hands or no alts but it is really fucking dumb.</div></div><hr />
