Raid Finder Loot Rules Update<br />
Short version: When using Raid Finder for the Dragon Soul raid instance, players whose currently assigned class role (Tank, Healer, or Damage) matches the class role that a piece of armor or a weapon is flagged for will receive +100 to their Need roll.<br />
In response to concerns regarding how loot will be distributed in the Raid Finder system, we are making some changes to how loot rolls will work when using the Need Before Greed system in the Raid Finder. When using Raid Finder for the Dragon Soul raid instance, players whose currently assigned class role (Tank, Healer, or Damage) matches the class role that a piece of armor or a weapon is flagged for will receive +100 to their Need roll. For purposes of this check, your currently assigned role is defined as the class role you have assigned when a boss is defeated. Sound confusing? I hope not, but here's how it'll work:<br />
<br />
A boss dies and drops EPIC TANKING ITEM.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
A mage in the group yawns and clicks the &quot;Greed&quot; button, getting a 98.<br />
<br />
<br />
A Fury warrior in the group wants to take up tanking, so he rolls &quot;Need&quot; and gets a solid 64.<br />
<br />
<br />
Both tanks want the item. Tank 1 rolls a 12, and Tank 2 rolls a 7.<br />
<br />
<br />
So what happens?<br />
<br />
Because the mage rolled greed, she's right out from the start. The Fury warrior's Need roll was higher than the tanks', but he was in the Damage Dealer role when the boss died, and the item is flagged for tanking, so his 64 is still just a 64 out of a possible 100. In contrast, Tank 1 and Tank 2 each get a 100 point bonus to their rolls because they were in the Tanking role when the boss died and they’re rolling on an item that has been flagged for the tanking role. That means that Tank 1 rolled a 112 out of 200, and tank 2 rolled a 107 out of 200. Tank 1 wins the item! If a roll got a bonus, that bonus will be clearly displayed in the chat log.<br />
<br />
Please keep in mind that, at least for now, this system will only look at class role, and not player spec. This bonus isn't only for tanking items either – it applies to Tanking, Damage Dealing, and Healing items, and some items are flagged for more than one class role too. Starting out, only Dragon Soul raid items will be flagged for class roles in this way (though all of the items in the raid will be flagged for one or more roles). As you might expect, all the normal Need Before Greed rules are still in place, so that means that these roll bonuses won't overrule normal class and usability restrictions. Item tooltips in the raid won't reflect which class roles will get rolling bonuses, but it should be fairly obvious based on stat allocations and item type.<br />
<br />
We are considering expanding this system to apply to the new 4.3 dungeons as well, though it is unlikely that we'll see the system apply to older dungeons or raids for now. Also, please keep in mind that this system is newly minted, and it may see further changes before it's released with the Raid Finder in patch 4.3.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There won't be a way to change roles all the time (it'll be just like 5man LFD role system) so this will be hard to exploit.<br />
<br />
Now let's hope they have someone capable of flagging those items to certain roles/classes. One would think any half decent raider could do it but we all know Blizard :D.</div></div><hr />

They're shafting people for being useful for the queue system. It also fails to mention that nearly all healer gear is shared with dps gear. There's no reason a healer cannot out roll other cloth wearers when collecting her OS kit. For example a Resto druid will have higher priority than a Feral druid when rolling on potential moonkin kit.</div></div><hr />

Presumably it's easier for them to add 100 rather than adding a third rolling hierarchy, since as you pointed out they accomplish the same thing.<br />
Seems like a good change, though I'm still curious how they'll go about handling the kick system and such.</div></div><hr />

There's always one.<br />
<br />
To explain it a bit, this system isn't designed so that people can EVER get OS gear over someone who needs it MS, and that's what people have always wanted.<br />
<br />
+100 isn't a guaranteed win because chances are you'll still have competition to roll against who are in that role and therefore get the +100 to their rolls as well, essentially stopping anyone from going in as a dps and winning tank or healer loot that the MS player wants, that parts important as another benefit is that a dps can roll need on every tank item if he wants to build a tank spec and not feel bad about it OR get flamed for it, as he will only actually have a chance of winning if the tanks don't want the item.</div></div><hr />

That's the point. Whenever a main spec tank rolls need on a tanking-flagged item, he's guaranteed to win it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because if its well enforced its harder to implement and if its loosely enforced (as in the buttons are there and you can still click whatever you want) there will still be douches.<br />
<br />
So either harder to implement or solves nothing, this solution is better in the way that is simpler and it does solve the problem to a high degree (not saying 100% because a tank can still roll need for a tanking item they already have and maybe giving it to a friend that is in the raid)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thats the whole point, the person rolling for off spec shouldn't get the item over the main spec roll. In a normal raid main spec beats off spec so why shouldn't it here?<br />
<br />
You gotta shake the LFG mentality, this is meant to be a beginners raid same rules apply as a normal raid just easier.<br />
<br />
<br />
I wonder why not make a MS need button and a OS need button<br />
<br />
Thats basically what this is, there just making sure MS gets priority by adding a internal mechanic. If theres no MS rolls the OS people still get a chance, the same way its done with other loot rules in a normal raid.</div></div><hr />

I truly hope that all the people that are &quot;for&quot; this, are also &quot;for&quot; tanks &quot;gearing up&quot; on &quot;your&quot; dungeon time. This will cut into the number of pre-geared (meaning, &quot;not queueing as a tank until I have gear, or the dungeon finder crowd will eat me&quot;) tanks, and even healers in the dungeon finder, I just hope you all realize that. Tanking was the hardest way to learn before, now it's even harder, since there is less drop-gear bleedover from lucky rolls won while DPSing. I can certainly live with this change, but I hope all the people dancing in the streets realize the implications of having the dungeon finder's NBG recognize role.

Please keep in mind that, at least for now, this system will only look at class role, and not player spec.<br />
I expect the system not to be perfect from the get go, but in time it will get fleshed out and it will consider specs aswell.</div></div><hr />

You cant change your roll mid dungeon in LFD, assuming the same will be true of LFR since its hard coded for 2 tanks 6 healers and no need to switch roll, there wont be any need to switch it up.</div></div><hr />

they may not just flag things by role, but may be flagged by role w/ class influence. or all &quot;caster&quot; items (int) count for casters, regardless of spirit or not. (tho i like the former better)</div></div><hr />

I don't see why not. They're 100% viable for those DPS.<br />
<br />
<br />
So what prevents having all fury, cats, retris and frostDKs to select tanking role just before the pull and have +100 on that last item they want from that specific boss?<br />

The fact that you can't just randomly change your role all the time...just like in LFD.<br />

I don't think you have understood the post, cause that's exactly what there doing. &quot;Locking specific roles&quot;<br />
<br />
Holy pally's will still get priority over the DK cause healing is the pally's MS, The DK can only roll as OS.<br />

I believe the main reason they mentioned for adding the 2 hour trade timer to BoP raid drops was specifically because of GMs constantly being petitioned to transfer items that MLs mistakenly gave to the wrong person. If so, they could simply make LFR drops a regular BoP.<br />
Do the LFD BoP drops have a trade timer on them? I can't recall and can't check for a while.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The fact that your slapped with your role before you even enter the Raid instance and that you cannot change it once you have entered. This is for the raid finder and once you are put in a certain role, you cannot change that role unless you requeue for the instance. <br />
<br />
OT: I am interested as to what they do for the spirit to hit conversion factors. I'm pretty sure it will be safe to assume that they will have it that both healers and dps of that specific class can roll on the item and will get the +100 to their roll. <br />
<br />
Another good question would be how to differentiate between a piece of plate gear that has say +hit and +mastery. Will it be seen as a tank item or dps item? I know the differences in STR and STA will come into play but I am just intrigued. And the whole bear/kitty argument is solved with the fact that there is no tanking leather or tanking polearms. I'm curious to see if they allow bears to roll on the STR rings/cloaks/necks that have dodge/mastery to use as a tank piece. <br />
<br />
All-in-all, this is definitely a fantastic idea and basically only applies to tank gear/holy pally/healing trinkets, but is definitely a fantastic thing to see and is making me consider doing the raid finder to gear up my alts!</div></div><hr />

And? As I said, I doubt they would let +spi items be able to get the bonus for healers AND dps simply because I doubt they want mages and warlocks to roll on +spi items.

This is probably the #1 reason I quit WoW. By the time I logged on, most of my guildies had already done their dailies. Taking the effort to heal/tank heroics on various alts and having loot taken by a dps. It really got on my nerves. LFG was a damn good idea, but without solid rules, a lot of people I met in LFG were just crummy. Can't tell you how many times things were just taken and some guy needed when he had better. Too bad. It's a bit late. I've been playing Rift, and everytime I think about coming back to WoW, a few minutes of those horrid graphics and general lack of things to do outside raiding make me just log right back off, and load up Rift again. Pretty sure Rift will have this feature soon, as they take all the best from WoW and make it better. Ironically, the community in the LFG in Rift seem to be better. Go Figure.</div></div><hr />

Wonder how it will work for Shadow Priests, Elemental shamans and boomkins, some times spirit gear (which is usually healer gear) is BIS because of the spirit to hit conversion. i swear do people not read. if could be both a healing and a dps item, then obviously both of them will be able to roll on it... spirit mace drops... ele shammy and holy pali get the 100+ need bonusenh shammy and prot pali who decides he wants it for OS doesnt get the 100 bonus------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------example 2expertise/mastery 1 hand str axe drops, both tanks and melee dps can roll on it with the bonus. ranged, casters, and healers dont get the bonus. -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------example 3any 2 hand str weapon, blood dks and melee[ uh dk, ret pali, arms/fury war, get to roll on with bonus.</div></div><hr />

shard of woe comes to mind. our hpally and disc priest would love to have it, but so would our arcane mage. lack of spirit gear in firelands made our caster dps have to share traditionally dps only items with priest heals due to the lack of said gear. hopefully blizzard doesn't screw the pooch with this whole thing.</div></div><hr />

I think Blizz will pay some attention while classifying items. The mace in your first example would be flagged as both DPS and healing stuff, so both the healer and the spriest/ele shammy will get the bonus. Easy!</div></div><hr />

They would probably only flag certain dps rolls as eligible for the loot, meaning a mage wouldn't be able to roll ms for it but a boomy might.<br />

If its flagged for more than one role (Which they stated there going to do) then yes it is possible. Doesn't have to be all dps, it can be a specific class that's flagged. They already flag specific classes/specs in the normal LFD so why wouldn't that work here?</div></div><hr />

Yeah, dps druids and shaman seem to be the biggest potential problems if the system won't monitor spec. Probably the most obvious solution would be to split the dps role into melee dps and ranged dps, which should solve it while still having it only monitor class and role.

Classes need so many similar stats, particularly when considering Healers and DPS. As a SPriest I'd roll on all cloth with haste on it (usually). Does that mean I get the +100 roll on everything? If not that means I am losing a great deal of my items that are good. And what about healers? The question becomes, why play a healer in LFR when I can get a wider selection of gear (including healer gear) as a DPS? With the exception of trinkets a SPriest can roll on every usable item for a holy/disc priest and they can only roll on items without + hit. You can't not give Hybrids the chance to roll on +Spi equally, as it makes up most of our hit. And what about classes that can have multiple DPS specs with different primary stats. My understanding of this system is that Boomkin or Ele shammy can roll on +agi gear with the bonus. So that means that an Elemental Shaman and a Boomkin can roll on every piece of gear of their respective armor type, and that's no different than normal. And if they do fix that what about classes that benefit from a little bit of item splashing, most noticeably Ehn Shammys that usually go for a little bit of +int (of course that's being changed but the idea stays the same). <br />
<br />
All in all, a lot of people are going to be screwed. It works well based in plate but every other armor type falls into the trap of Hybrid = +100 for OS too, Pure = +100 for MS, Healer = + 100 for MS. So it's great for Hybrids.</div></div><hr />

Huh? It kind of seems like some people are expecting this to not do things even the LFD Need before Greed system already does for some reason. It obviously looks at class already since I can't roll need on a shield as a DK tank in LFD.<br />
It sounds like the role-based system is being merged with the current class-based system, rather than displacing it. I'd imagine that means a DK can roll on a 2H whether he's specified as dps or tank and won't be able to suddenly roll on tanking shields, even if he's set as tank.</div></div><hr />

<br />
if they aren't factoring in spec/class then, like i said, someone will get the short end of the stick. Since it's an item with spirit, chances are it's dedicated to a healer role. Players with the healing role selected int he raid will be able to roll /need+100, players with a healing OS will be able to roll a /need, and pure classes will have to roll /greed. Simple as that. Locks and mages will not be able to roll need on an item with spirit. Only players that can actually benefit from the item in some way.<br />

The only thing that may cause an issue is that boomies, ele shamans and shadow priests also use their armor-specific gear with spirit on them for the +hit to spirit utility. Chances are they'll still be able to /need+100 since they can actually use it.</div></div><hr />

/concur. i knew from the get-go that when LFRtards was announced this was going to put druids in particular in a place where they could simply roll need on almost anything. this is where blizz shit the bed for removing healing power and making it all spellpower. in tbc items were plain and simple for one role or another. homogenization in general makes this discussion possible.<br />
<br />
+100 sucks. should be +50. it is an improvement, of sorts. they need to factor in other things beyond 'role' to get this right. i doubt they will.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Leather agility pieces will likely share the same modifier for Druids and Rogues so it remains the same as if it was just a standard 1 - 100 /roll. The same will likely be handled with cloth/leather caster DPS and healers where it will use the +100 modifier but simply function the same as a 1 - 100 /roll with the possible exception of +hit.<br />
<br />
Two handers will likely be fought over by a DK tank and DPS as was usually the case since stats such as Mastery (if there are 2H with mastery) is just as good for Ret Paladins as it it for Blood Death Knights. <br />
<br />
As a Feral Combat Druid, I've always had to contend with Bear tanks and Rogues for my DPS set (with the exception of when agility gear had +def/dodge up to tbc) so I suspect nothing will really change in that regard but it will make that Boomkin unable to win gear I use as my main spec.<br />
<br />
This will simply remedy the issue of having greedy players who want to gear their off spec over your main spec. The finer details will likely remain the same as they are now but with a +100 modifier for a much larger margin between rolls for those it applied to.<br />
<br />
Another benefit of this is that there is no reason for players to run it with their off spec due to availability since the tool does it all for you. No more threads of upset players who have been forced in to their off spec to raid or upset players who have lost gear to off spec players.</div></div><hr />

This goes both ways. Disc priests, for example, need gear that doesn't have Spirit on it, as Int is a more valuable stat. I prefer to have more Int and mastery on my gear than spirit.. If I had the choice, I'd go all off pieces as Int, and only Tier set w/ Spirit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
yer but then you get the problem that some items is actualy for more roles than 1 like Resto dodos and boomkins wich both use spirit for either mana regen or hit, same with ele/resto shamys.<br />
so some items must be flagged for more roles than 1 or they will be forced to change the boomers/ele shamy talents so they dont get any spellhit bonus at all from spirit like they did with locks.</div></div><hr />

What your complaining against is a class design. Nothing to do with the looting system. I as a plate dps have no issue with competetion for drops that need on drops. But with certain class design you will get this and unless blizzard completely redesign the hybrid caster hit/spirit there isn't much that can be done about it really. I would not personal mind losing a expertise/mastery item to a tank, its viable for the both of us. If I was to lose a crit/hast item to a tank or pally healer then thats what this system prevents</div></div><hr />

Making it potentially MORE difficult for Role B to acquire appropriate gear so they can play Role A.The Role Selection feature needs to be AUTOMATED, based on your specialization. And instead of the bonus being &quot;X + 100 / 100&quot; it should be &quot;X / 200&quot;.Instead of guaranteeing that Role A beats out Role B on Role A gear, you should merely tip the scales in their favor. It's not a &quot;bonus&quot; if you just auto-win the roll. This effectively makes the bonus equivalent to getting two rolls instead of one.The same can be achieved with &quot;X + 50 / 100.&quot;A guaranteed &quot;i win cuz I'm the (insert role)&quot; is going to blow up in everyone's face.</div></div><hr />

You can't really add moonkin and ele shaman in that. Blizzard doesn't make leather or mail gear with int and hit on it (unless its teir), and those healers should have to roll against someone like everybody else (except holy paladin :( ). Also priests should be able to roll and get a bonus on gear without spirit. So it seems fair to me.</div></div><hr />

Bear druids would still have to fight for leather in a normal raid, i think a lot of you are thinking way to into this.<br />
Blizzard wants the LFR to mimic Normal raid rules, the fact that more than one role/class can use gear, one attempt at a boss a week, one piece of gear per boss per lockout, all this stuff happens in normal raids there gonna happen here to only difference the fights are easier.</div></div><hr />

<br />
New button = Lots of work<br />
Same button, but with a small tweak to favor one over the other with a static boost = Less work than new button<br />
<br />
Besides, do you really want 18 buttons on your loot roller? Main Spec (Icon) Off Spec (Icon) Greed (Icon) Disenchant (Icon), nevermind trying to explain that system to someone who's never raided before. &quot;Okay new guy, If you're a tank, you can main spec for this gear. otherwise you have to offspec for it. but you can only main spec for one item, and off spec for the rest.&quot;<br />
<br />
vs.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you want it, hit need. if someone who is of the appropriate role needs it over you, too bad.&quot; Else: Greed or DE. Simple, somewhat hack-ish, but does what it's intended to do.</div></div><hr />

MS can roll 1 and OS roll 100, and MS will still win with 101. so there's not much point in that<br />
<br />
That is the point.. if the tank needs the item, there is no way a non-tank can win it, but it still allows the fury warrior (who can roll need) to always beat a mage who can only roll greed in the event that neither tank rolls need. In the past, the fury warrior had two options.... roll need against the tank (and risk getting kicked) or else roll greed and have to roll against people who are just going to vendor it. This system creates that layer in the middle that most players wanted.<br />
<br />
It will work out exactly the same as having a ´need for offspec´ button, but was probably a lot easier to implement since it required no UI work or really much effort at all.<br />
<br />
There are still going to be problems.. bear tanks, DK tank weapons to name a few... but they are limited items and their aren´t that many specs that would roll need against them.<br />

I see many people mention the Spirit gear, but has no real argument behind it. &quot;Oh it's Spirit it's only for healers!&quot;, gear with Spirit is made for the healers class AND the caster spec for the same class who use spirit conversation talents. For example Leather Healing gear, how many classes do you actually think uses those? That's right, Restoration Druid and therefore Moonkins will have the Spirit conversation for all Leather gear out there to share those with Restoration Druids, this is also a reason why there aren't many Leather gear with stat allocation towards Hit Rating (other than Tier possibly). Now you think about Cloth Healers, how many are there? That's right only two specialization of one class (Priest) which is why they decided that Shadow should also be able to so the whole class is aiming for Spirit gear and let the Hit Rating go for the other two classes, Mages and Warlocks. (Yes, I am saying that Shadow Priest should not go for Hit Rating, but Spirit!). The same argument exist for Shamans aswell seeing how only one Mail specialization within one class needs Spirit they made so that the other caster role uses Spirit for Hit aswell. TL;DR: I would say that if you got Spirit Conversation to Hit Rating you should only aim for gear with Spirit (or no Spirit/Hit Rating at all on some specific pieces). Since that is the way your class was itemized around. I don't see why people are QQ'ing about it when you just look at how many are using each. It's more fight over those pieces who has neither Spirit or Hit Rating. Class Specs for items with Hit Rating = 6 Class Specs for items with Spirit = 8 Class Specs for items with neither: 14</div></div><hr />

<br />
This. The function of this new addition is to make you only worry about rolling against other specs. If it so happens that the class you're rolling against has a use for an item in multiple specs, well, that's gravy for them if that spec is DPS, but if that off-spec happens to be a healing or tanking spec, this will eliminate your worrying that someone will win the item for a spec they are not in. Really, this is a classy solution and I'm a huge fan of it.</div></div><hr />

Reduces ninjas and also allows people to need things for offspec without having to wait for all 24 other people to roll to see whether anyone needs it for main spec.

So dps classes cant need on healing gear, I have a priest so they cant need on spirt cloth. If thats the case then I can see the change is going to do well.

ust hope that the put this in the LFG as well, when I do runs with people that I know try to get gear and they use it for OS, I do try and need on it aslo to help them out. Otherwise they would be healer/tank less and spend longer trying to find one.<br />

and weapons with spirit. and cloth with spirit. as it can be reforged to hit for derp locks and mages in 359s as 397 stats will be superior in every way over jp 359s. not a good solution, but a small step in the right direction. still leaves boomkin, spriest, ele shaman, h pally, holy/disc priests, resto shaman, warlocks and mages potentially fighting for gear that they shouldn't be - examples of items that will be difficult to classify as tank/healer/dps only: trinkets, rings, necks, weapons, offhands, wrists, belts, boots, etc.</div></div><hr />

Blood tank gets+100. Thats wrong. Items can be flagged for multi roles. So nobody gets+100 then. Only when a tank shield drops tanks get+100 as example. Bears are screwed then though because hunters need their pole arms and rogues need their gear :D<br />
<br />
2 handers are MS for Blood DKs<br />
2 handers are MS for Warriors<br />
2 handers are MS for Ret Paladins.<br />
<br />
There is no change here.<br />
<br />
The same goes for your Rogue vs Feral Druid on gear, both use leather both get +100<br />
The same goes for oyur Hunter vs Feral Druid, both use polearms for the MS, both get +100<br />
<br />
This system seems to be designed for the other 80% of loot drops. <br />
-The Tank rolling offspec and winning the roll over the Melee DPS MS, who doesnt even have the item yet<br />
-The DPS rolling offspec and winning the roll over the tanks MS, who doesnt even have the item yet (how many plate DPS rolled on H Leaden Dispear in Stonecore so they wouldnt have to tank stonecore to try and get the trinket?)<br />
-The healer rolling offspec and winning the roller over the DPS, who doesnt even have the item yet<br />
The Hybrid DPS rolling offspec and winning the roll over the healer, who doesnt even have the item yet<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Now instead of screwing people out of their Ms rolls it screws them out of their Os rolls, lol. <br />
Plate DPS MS have a bonus over plate tanks<br />
Plate tanks have a bonus over Plate DPS MS<br />
<br />
<br />
People are still going to have the GS/item level bias they always have, people dont like undergeared tanks/healers or DPS in their runs. So people would queue as the roll they had the better gear for and roll offspec. Which lead to many a arguement over &quot;QUEUE FOR THE DAMN JOB IF YOU WANNA ROLL ON THAT LOOT MY MS&gt;YOUR OS&quot;, which is why this new system was made.<br />
<br />
It gives those who queued as the job the item is designed for an advantage over those who didnt. It allows people to gear up their MS faster, as they cant be out rolled by people rolling OS, which is good, but means people take a little longer to gear up their OS, which is fine, it's their OS.<br />
<br />
<br />
How many of you have complained your tanks in LFD were undergeared yet willingly rolled OS over the tanks MS and won the roll on the loot thus keeping said tank from gearing up? I've seen my share of Warriors DKs and Paladins rolling on tank trinkets for their OS my tanks dont even have for my MS yet.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Essentially they did make a main spec and off spec button. Just this was probably less program than adding an additional button and greying out main spec for some. Basically if it's your off spec you get 1-100. If it's your main spec you get 101-200.</div></div><hr />

This is the same thing, without having to modify the UI and how rolls work all across WoW.<br />
<br />
This idea was probably much easier to implement going forward.<br />
<br />
The point is that a main spec rolling a 1 should beat an offspec rolling 100. So this is as intended.</div></div><hr />

Hit/exp are currently valid tank stats, though that may change in the future. Mastery is popular with many specs, but adored by shield tanks. Spirit/hit are somewhat interchangeable with casters/heals, and healers are sometimes not fond of the crit sometimes found on designated healer gear, despite the subtle insistence. Splitting agility along leather/mail helps, but when it comes to weapons things are probably even more complicated. Though I suppose there won't be a whole lot of pre-deathwing dragon soul weapons? If any? Does LFRaid even go up to the final encounter with all the weapons? Well, whatever. We wait and watch. Not like it's a big deal, loot's always been a pretty whimsical spin.</div></div><hr />

Solid system, no flaws from what I can see, liking it.<br />
<br />
I think the only issue will be with how they split up the gear. There are a lot of issues, such as bear tanks, DK tank weapons and probably the biggest headache will be healers vs spriests, moonkin and elllie shaman. If a cloth item has spirit on it, does that mean spriests get the bonus 100 and a mage doesn´t? Does a bear tank get the bonus 100 for an AGI ring with crit and mastery (which is a very viable bear tank item).</div></div><hr />

Yes, but you've been rolling against Hunters since the beginning anyway. This new system doesn't replace your competition for main spec, it just eliminates the off-spec ninja issue.</div></div><hr />

<br />
exactly this.<br />
<br />
In regards to MS rolls, there is no change. Blood DKs still roll against Warriors, DPS DKs and Ret Paladins<br />
Druids still roll against Hunters for staves and Polearms<br />
<br />
<br />
The problem the new loot rules are trying to stop is the Fury Warrior rolling on the Tank trinket when the tank doesn't even have it yet.<br />
Or the Prot Paladin rolling on the DPS bracers when the Fury warrior doesn't have them yet.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The biggest issue I can see is for the Spirit gear, some times its BIS for both healers and DPS. If both get the +100 roll for their MS, then it's no different than LFD at the moment</div></div><hr />

I think a lot of people are confusing the ´role´ option in the raid interface (which we already have) with the ´role´ option you will use with the new LFR tool. This system will look at the role you select when you first join the LFR tool.. it has nothing to do with the current raid interface where you can change your role at will.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is what I am wondering as well. Caster items with spirit, caster items with hit, and caster items with neither are interesting to me. I know Blizzard and MMO-Champ do not use the same loot classification system, but things like Jaws of Defeat and Shard of Woe (Healer BiS trinks atm) are labled Spellpower DPS on this site simply because they do not have spirit on them. If they do somehow incorrectly label items, I hope they will not take long to hotfix them, or hope that they will not ignore the error entirely. Then there are more sticky situations like Druid/Hunter Polearms, Hunter/Rogue Ranged Weapons, Enhancement Spellpower items (although that is going away I think), and so on.<br />
<br />
Regardless, if implemented right I see no problem with this.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard has gone too far with expanding the rolling from 1-100!<br />
<br />
if no one can roll greed then what happens if no one wants the item. the people that cant use it don't even get to vendor or de it? no that's retarded. it's fine the way it is.</div></div><hr />

This is for the raid finder and once you are put in a certain role, you cannot change that role unless you requeue for the instance. <br />
<br />
OT: I am interested as to what they do for the spirit to hit conversion factors. I'm pretty sure it will be safe to assume that they will have it that both healers and dps of that specific class can roll on the item and will get the +100 to their roll. <br />
<br />
Another good question would be how to differentiate between a piece of plate gear that has say +hit and +mastery. Will it be seen as a tank item or dps item? I know the differences in STR and STA will come into play but I am just intrigued. And the whole bear/kitty argument is solved with the fact that there is no tanking leather or tanking polearms. I'm curious to see if they allow bears to roll on the STR rings/cloaks/necks that have dodge/mastery to use as a tank piece. <br />
<br />
All-in-all, this is definitely a fantastic idea and basically only applies to tank gear/holy pally/healing trinkets, but is definitely a fantastic thing to see and is making me consider doing the raid finder to gear up my alts!<br />
<br />
Blizzard drastically nerfed STR for feral druids a few patches ago.. I highly doubt they would give them the bonus 100 after basically already eliminating it as a viable option.<br />
<br />
There are a lot of grey areas.. my guess is they are going to be as forgiving as possible with the items. But I wonder how precise they are going to be. Are they going to actually look at specs.. spriests get bonus 100 for spirit gear, but mages don´t? How about kitty dps getting bonus100 on moonkin gear (both in a dps role).. will mages get bonus100 on all cloth gear and healers not unless it has spirit?</div></div><hr />

<br />
If this system does not work with specs it will just be unfair to some classes. I wouldn't think I want to bring my restoration shaman if my off-spec is enhancement, I could just go as enhancement and get all the loots than just half of what I could use. Same with druids, I just go as dps and I then should be able to gear up a boomkin, resto and feral spec with need+100 with just the single role I signed up for. <br />

Heck this system would make it even easier for me to get gears as a shaman (for example) than how it is today in most pugs.<br />

With spirit, it will probably give bonuses to classes whose spec can either use it to heal, or convert spirit into hit for DPS, both of which Warlocks and Mages cannot.<br />

from blizzard: &quot;Please keep in mind that, at least for now, this system will only look at class role, and not player spec.&quot; so this argument is invalid. spec isn't factored in. 397 ivl stats &gt; 359 ilvl stats. as such, a mage could see a spirit item as a huge upgrade, if only to reforge the spirit to hit.</div></div><hr />

Molten Armor used to convert a spirit percentage into critical strike rating, it changed when 4.0 went live. So mages don't need spirit anymore and probably never will again.<br />

<br />
Currently, as a rogue, I can roll need on some strength items, trinkets and weapons generally. Theoretically, in this system, I can roll need as a DPS on a strength DPS trinket and have a guarantee to win it over a warrior/pally/dk tank who could actually use it as an off-spec as opposed to just being vendor trash for me. Same with spirit and mages. A mage can win spirit gear over a pally or druid tank, as many spirit items will be flagged as both DPS and healer items. Once again, vendor trash (and seriously sub-optimal gear) will win over somebody who could legitimately use the item as an off-spec.<br />

Additionally, shamans and druids present another issue. Boomkins rolling on agility leather rolling on equal playing field to rogues and ferals, ele shammies rolling on hunter and enhance loot. This is a problem that exists now, of course, but the role feature just highlights it. Further, you can't separate it into melee and ranged DPS because agility mail is used by both, as are agility rings, trinkets, necks etc.<br />
<br />
Once again, it's better than nothing, but it's not as good a step as the loot system detecting your current spec and off-spec and opening up MS Need and OS Need based on those instead. And they really need to revisit their flagging system, anyway.</div></div><hr />

<br />
While I understand your plight, hunters were using polearms since vanilla and druids didn't get them until BC. While I am not saying it is a &quot;Hunter weapon&quot; (As that kind of thought pattern pisses me off) I am thinking that one will be shared while the bow/gun/cross bow will be placed as MS for hunters since rogues use throwing weapons. o.0 Or should at least.</div></div><hr />

I don´t think any bear tank could consider it getting screwed over to lose a piece of leather armor to a rogue on a fair roll. What we don´t want to see is a bear tank losing a leather AGI piece too a restro druid, which this will prevent. I would be a little ´iffed´ if I lost an AGI staff to a hunter, but that is a minor thing.

from blizzard: &quot;Please keep in mind that, at least for now, this system will only look at class role, and not player spec.&quot; so this argument is invalid. spec isn't factored in. 397 ivl stats &gt; 359 ilvl stats. as such, a mage could see a spirit item as a huge upgrade, if only to reforge the spirit to hit.<br />

This isn't like a raid where you do a role check.<br />

this is like the LDF where you queue as a specific role (or roles, I guess) and enter the raid as a specific role. so 2 tanks, 17 dps, and 6 healers.</div></div><hr />

I've wanted them to implement something like this for fucking ever.... (well, mainly since a goddamn tank stole my caster dps item I tried to get for weeks) and I really don't see why it has taken them this long. Stuff with Spirit is obviously (now, that finally removed it from e.g. mages) intended for healers or healer-hybrids, they should get a /roll bonus for that. Stuff with dodge, parry etc. is obviously intended for tanks, it makes not goddamn sense for someone to be able to &quot;steal&quot; it from a tank. Stuff with hit is obviously intended for dps, no tank or healer should be able to steal it from a dps. Factor in armor classes and the fact that we now have a role check, that they can just make mandatory and we should be set. Seeing as they don't differentiate between specs stuff like heal priests vs dps priests can still be an issue but that shouldn't be that hard to implement either, you can't change speccs during the fight the item drops in so if you're shadow you won't get this role bonus on e.g. spirit stuff. &quot;Why does everyone automatically think someone rolling for their offspec is a ninja/jerk?&quot; Because it fucking is. If there is no one of that specific class/role needing on the item, go for it, it's fine. But if a tank needs a tank item and a plate dps/healer also needs, because they can, and they win?

Should be equal in that case. A feral tank would benefit from the item for their mainspec just as much as a rogue would for dps. Now if a resto druid rolled need and a feral tank rolled need then it should receive the bonus if it's flagged properly.</div></div><hr />

What your describing is the exact reason why this is implemented and why so many people wanted it. I was hoping for a Need, Offspec, Greed, DE buttons but this works perfectly fine. If people are not doing that role in that fight they should not have any reason to take the item from those that are performing the roll of the item that dropped. If a person wants a tank piece, or wants a healing piece, they sure better be doing those roles when it drops. Some people tank for the queue, some people tank for fun, some people tank just so we can get things rolling. If they're willing to sacrifice some enjoyment to get the tank items so can other people(same applies to dps and healers)</div></div><hr />

want tank gear? Q as a tank and do what the tank did in order for that boss to die.

However, unless we see updates to how Blizzard flags loot, it's only going to highlight Blizzard's failures in that area.<br />
<br />
Currently, as a rogue, I can roll need on some strength items, trinkets and weapons generally. Theoretically, in this system, I can roll need as a DPS on a strength DPS trinket and have a guarantee to win it over a warrior/pally/dk tank who could actually use it as an off-spec as opposed to just being vendor trash for me. Same with spirit and mages. A mage can win spirit gear over a pally or druid tank, as many spirit items will be flagged as both DPS and healer items. Once again, vendor trash (and seriously sub-optimal gear) will win over somebody who could legitimately use the item as an off-spec.<br />
<br />
Additionally, shamans and druids present another issue. Boomkins rolling on agility leather rolling on equal playing field to rogues and ferals, ele shammies rolling on hunter and enhance loot.

Faster than I could plead my case in a civil manner to please pass to me, they would just leave party, often with an unwarranted insult to me first.

Moonkin, Ellies and spriests would have a hard time if they don´t mark spirit gear as dps.

Seriously Blizz, I had hope for the Raid Finder until this.You go ahead and roll need. If you are an arms warrior, thus, set as a dps role when you signed up for the raid finder, you could roll 100 on a need roll and still lose if any of the tanks are plate wearers and roll need, too.<br />
<br />

All this will do is push geared and competent tanks into a dps role, where their gear is severely lacking, and geared and competent dps into a tanking role, where their gear is severely lacking.<br />
<br />
Instead of queuing with your best geared spec you play the best at, it's queue up in your under geared, under performing other spec, cause some cry baby qq'd enough on the forums, never realizing what they were crying about.<br />
<br />
You will see these same cry babies crying about bad tanks/healers queuing in dps gear, and bad dps, queuing in tank/healing gear.<br />
<br />
Then too bad?<br />
If your secondary spec is so undergeared that you're holding the raid back, then why the hell are you even in there when that's what 5 man heroics can fix in very little time?<br />
If you're so bad at your secondary spec that you're going to underperform your gear too, then why are you even concerned with getting raid gear for it? Even with gear, you'll still be worthless on any content you don't overgear, so again you're better off just jumping in a heroic and learning how to play it.<br />
<br />
Stop acting like being able to roll on anything your class can use makes or breaks everyone's ability to gear up off specs, even in current pug raids if you choose to roll dps main spec as a tank, then they don't let you still roll against the other tanks when tank gear drops. Hell, if it's going off the role you queued as, you can even use a little ingenuity and queue as dps, then ask any tank you outgear if they have a dps off spec they can switch to, allowing you to play your stronger geared spec without altering what you can roll on.</div></div><hr />

adding a number to a roll is a more easy cost solution programming wise than adding buttons with functions and having two different roll interface (that need to be maintained afterwards) that activates in two different situations (LFR and everything else) ^^</div></div><hr />

LFR doesn't work that way, it works the same way as LFD - the roll you select before queuing into a dungeon is the role you're locked in at, there's no changing it. That only works in formed raids (i.e. pugs, guild runs), not LFR.</div></div><hr />
