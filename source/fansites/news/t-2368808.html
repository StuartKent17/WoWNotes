Probably something that can't be fixed with a simple hotfix.<br />
<br />
As you are in Norway I'll assume you are in EU. It's 2-10 in the MORNING. Not night. So you will still be able to play during the evening and mid morning.</div></div><hr />

How do you know it's non crucial?<br />
<br />
They wouldn't be doing an 8 hour maintenance on the weekend over a non crucial issue. It would just be either a few hours or a simple hotfix.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That is a PTR build.<br />
<br />
We don't know if it's going live on Saturday.<br />
<br />
Not to mention the few other plethora of bugs people have been reporting since the patch dropped.<br />
<br />
Not everything can be done with a simple hotfix. Even Blizzard aren't that mighty. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Obviously they aren't going to come out and say what critical bug or exploit is being fixed so people can abuse it before it gets fixed.<br />
<br />
Also you can turn yourself invisible and untargetable amidst the heaps of other bugs that have broken pretty much every aspect of the game. Seems pretty broken to me.</div></div><hr />

Look at it from another side. Someone at Blizzard has to come work overtime during Sat/Sun night to do this maintenence. Im sure they'd rather spend this night in club/with friends/familiy.</div></div><hr />

This should have been done in the 7.3.5 PTR stage. Y'know, when everyone reported these issues?<br />
<br />
There are 3 possibilities why this was ignored. <br />
<br />
- No manpower, no clue how to fix the things. <br />
- Management fails<br />
- ignorance to community <br />
<br />
We know make the stockholders more happy, staff is reduced to a minimum. It could be possible, the manpower was given away and working on another project. I think they just forget it, which point to a suck*** management problem. Another managment is the unbalance between<br />
classes and specs. I think from everything a little...... <br />
<br />
according to Noxxic, the top DD WL with 2.4M DPS compared to the last one Outlaw Rogue, 1.5M DPS, it has nothing to do with Class balance <br />
I would say Blizzard doing a poor Job fixing classes. BM Pets are bugged since Day 1 Blizzard don t want fix that or Blizzard have no idea how to fix that? <br />
<br />
Apple got sued about this Battery/Performance problem, I wounder when the first issue come up about their mismanagement. It is definitive time.</div></div><hr />

Regarding HoTS - I agree, it's a garbage game in an oversaturated MOBA market. I wish Blizzard would just cut it loose (like D3) and categorized it as a failed experiment. <br />
Lootboxes in one way or another aren't going away, and even if they are the trend will just shift to your typical microtransactions. Money-grubbing suits gonna <br />
suit.</div></div><hr />

If that is true then it's pointless.<br />
<br />
If we go by recent strings it looks like DX9/32 bit are going away in 8.0. There really isn't/shouldn't have been any more point doing any work on the 32 bit client at this stage.<br />
<br />
Just leave it as it is until 8.0. Why they messed with it is beyond me because if that is the case it's created this issue.</div></div><hr />

This is a bunch of retard shit since blizzard lootboxes aren't forced nor make you &quot;play&quot; the game like the Battlefront 2-gate<br />

And that Mechastorm thing, feels like Blizzard copying what Riot have done with an Anime vid, how they use various styles in all their vids... :p<br />
<br />
This is prob one of the most crucial fixes out there.<br />
Reason it takes a long time? They prob need to rollback the patch and do some changes to it and then patch it up again and after that they need to be sure its up and working again since this is not a normal way to do patches for them. They also had one of the biggest breaks in raids since several years now and they prob want to be 100% sure that part works.<br />
<br />
And since the patch is during mid night it really does not matter that much for me.</div></div><hr />

Of course the loud minority comes here again and cry about these inhuman time schedules. I bet they will be done with the maintenance even earlier than expected.<br />

Asking for gametime compensation is absurd. You get such thing when you are banned/suspended for something you didn't do. (I had this once. They thought I trade gold, then a GM revised the logs and found that I actually helped a friend move some of his gold from horde to allinace. I got 2 days of free gametime compensation.)</div></div><hr />

I have the feeling, blizz qa got stuck in the golden 2000s, when tester was a glorified monkey and qa was used sort of like a farm to keep perspective people with talent inside the company. Once you'd proven to be good enough, some other dept would poach you, leaving qa constantly with junior staff. I mean, the bugs we encounter in-game after almost every patch, the inconsistencies/bugs in hearthstone card interactions people like disguised toast uncover only couple days after each set release. Something like that would not be possible if their qa was worth a penny. And if the shit with db compression is true, it only proves this. No decent qa manager would ever allow a last day change like this go live. Shit like that needs a ton of testing before it gets green light. So either their qa is completely incompetent, or they have no say in stuff like this. Not sure which would be worse.</div></div><hr />

So you buff it 300% then nerf it 30%. So it was still buffed like 270%.<br />
<br />
I mean, there are zero reasons that would justify making old raids harder. If it was like they said and it was an unintentional effect from the global scaling, they would be reverting back to the original numbers.<br />

This was clearly intentional and it feels like a pretty lame move from the company overall.</div></div><hr />

As I logged on PTR, at least MoP mobs didn't seem reduced at all, outdoor @ 89. 30-40k hp each.<br />
<br />
WoD mobs DID get reduced a lot however, 203k to 137k for a 99 ogre, regular mob.</div></div><hr />
