Do none of you understand the principles of software testing? This is a first pass to check the mechanics of the fight, check that the oozes spawn correctly, that the slime sprayers work and do damage, that the boss dies correctly when it gets to zero health and doesn't randomly respawn ala Vashj etc. They WANT players to get through the whole fight, hence the boss does f-all damage and has less health than the final live version. Stop bitching already.</div></div><hr />

Only saw the caught the last minute or so, seems when you destroy an ooze, it puts down a large slimed area aoe.. reminded of Grobb, except that instead of it being the players that put it down, it's now the adds, which is understandably harder, but still not exactly hard. Hopefully 25-man damage, when hotfixed, makes this a lot more dangerous.</div></div><hr />

As the fight is atm with the low HP you dont actually get to see the whole fight since you kill him before the fight mechanics starts to kick in...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes. <br />
<br />
1. Its not like making a new model takes a gig of space, wow's graphics aren't that complex.<br />
<br />
2. In the age where an average new computer comes with 500GB - 750GB of new space, I don't think I've talked to anyone in years who has had issues with running out of disk space.<br />

In the age where an average new computer comes with 500GB - 750GB of new space, I don't think I've talked to anyone in years who has had issues with running out of disk space.<br />
<br />
<br />
I have 2 laptops(getting old, will be getting a new one soon, hopefully), and a semi-old desktop. I also have 2 external(my 1tb one just died on me though :( ). I'm pretty much out of space on all, as it is. I also happen to be a university student who only recently got permanent residency, meaning money isn't quite abundant for me.<br />
<br />
Add to that my variety of interests (I do some graphics, audio, video editing, some game development, etc) and space quickly becomes an issue.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I suppose I may have exaggerated how many people I expected to sympathize, but it is an issue for me.</div></div><hr />

Do none of you understand the principles of software testing? This is a first pass to check the mechanics of the fight, check that the oozes spawn correctly, that the slime sprayers work and do damage, that the boss dies correctly when it gets to zero health and doesn't randomly respawn ala Vashj etc. They WANT players to get through the whole fight, hence the boss does f-all damage and has less health than the final live version. Stop bitching already.<br />

Remember Illidan's phase 4 after they reduced bosses hp by 30% 1 month before WotLK?</div></div><hr />

<br />
While that's the most likely case, that's not ALWAYS 100% true. I recall watching the live stream testing of Twins in ToC25 and thought to myself. &quot;surely that isn't all the boss has? This is, of course, testing and they will undoubtedly make the mechanics of the fight harder than clicking on white/black portals. Right? .....right?&quot; <br />

If you COULD care less then you obviously do care an amount...<br />

Bunch of people from my guild had the same problem,we resolved it buy simply picking up quest &quot;Battle before Citadel&quot;.Apparently having that quest in your log enables you to see instance portal :)<br />
Ofc having locks inside to summon works always.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And as for the models, I would wager they are not placeholder. Had they been, I hardly see blizz using two different textures for each(even if they are simple recolours). I would have expected two of the exact same model/texture. My money's on those being what you'll see on live. Compare, for example, with Thorim's old model, which was merely a completely rehashed model that had been resized (Vanilla Titan model, iirc), but had been updated for Ulduar.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Valtiel</div><div class="date">2009-10-22, 08:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">And here we come again with the &quot;OMG GUISE STOP WHINING ABOUT EZMODE IT'S JUST THE PTR&quot; and &quot;LOL IT'S A PLACEHOLDER MODEL&quot;.<br />
<br />
I find it hilarous that people act like suggesting Blizzard is using the same model for 2 bosses is a show of childish QQ, when evidence is that Blizzard builds 75% of their instances by upscaling trash mobs or world mobs and calling them &quot;bosses&quot;. The number of bosses with unique models is effectively very limited, when you look at it, even in fan favourite instances (like Sunwell). Ulduar was a very high point in boss model design and it still featured plenty of enlarged world mobs as bosses.<br />
<br />
And once again, the old &quot;it's the PTR so it's gonna become incredibly challenging in live&quot; argument. Once again, whiny immature kids jump the gun and claim things are too easy on normalmodes. Said kids have evidence such as Ulduar and ToC. People who claim that &quot;Blizzard will fix it&quot; have their own fantasies and fanboyism to fuel them. Who gets more credit?<br />
<br />
Face it, Blizzard managed to make even competitive play (arena) facerollable. If they wanted to pose us with challenges (outside of hardmodes) they would have long ago. Arthas will be pugged, accept it.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">WillFeral</div><div class="date">2009-10-22, 09:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The problem with current content is this:even it is fun content play,especially Ulduar,Blizzard seems to be making the gap between normal and heroic too close.<br />
If they would simply widen the difficulty gap alot of the QQ would stop.<br />
Solution:25 man normal raid should be on the level of gruul/magtheridon like in TBC,25 man heroic should be on the level as Black Temple/Sunwell.<br />
That would leave everyone an option to play however they like,and if you QQ about it being too easy then step up to heroic,Black Temple may havent been extremely hard but Sunwell was,and there is nobody and i mean Nobody that could say Sunwell was easy.<br />
SKGaming got world first on Kil'jaeden and it took them 242 attempts.<br />
But this is only makes alot of sense so therefore it's something Blizzard wouldnt even consider. &gt;:(</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Angevinus</div><div class="date">2009-10-22, 10:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It wouldn't stop the QQ. People would complain that they have to do raids that are much harder but other guilds can do normal modes and progress and clear faster than the can.<br />
<br />
In the end , what it boils down to is that hard core raiders want raid dungeons to be for them and only them. They do not wany any kind of easy mode accessibility.<br />
<br />
I agree with your solution though.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">couic</div><div class="date">2009-10-22, 06:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hum, if you read closely the capacity of the boss/mobs, this fight seems to be much more than a simple grobulusbis.<br />
<br />
Yes we have infections. Yes we have blobs.<br />
<br />
BUT the blobs spawn directly uder the player, and that players takes quite a lot of damage from the curse itself (3900 to 4100 damage every 1 sec) with 50% heal (so need a really quick dispel. But even with a quick dispel, the player still take 2925 to 3075 damage every 1 sec and decreases move speed by 50%.... think of the poor clothes....<br />
<br />
Moreover, those little blobs need to be killed asap, otherwise you will first take damage, and it will soon merge with a big blob. And if a big blob gets 5 merging, Bam 9750 to 10250 damage ...<br />
<br />
I dont know the fequency of the curse, but it could become really fast a big mess with blobs exploding everywhere and 50% runing speed goo spread everywhere....</div></div><hr />
