World of Warcraft Interview Recaps<br />
Lots of interviews took place at BlizzCon, so we are starting with some recaps today!<br />
<br />
Trade Chat Interview with Alex Afrasiabi and Chris Robinson<br />
Tradechat (https://www.youtube.com/user/TradeChat) sat down with Alex Afrasiabi and Chris Robinson to discuss Battle for Azeroth (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/7117-BlizzCon-2017-World-of-Warcraft-What-s-Next).<br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;iframe width=&quot;900&quot; height=&quot;180&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/gKhGEj3-y8o&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
Dungeon bosses will consist of threats outside the Horde and Alliance conflict.<br />
Faction conflict is the foreground and the outside threats are a slow build up in this expansion.<br />
Redoing Kalimdor and Eastern Kingdoms again was an option, however, team realized the narrative was tied to level and decided to use sharding tech to change existing zones for characters 110 and above.<br />
Team wanted players to connect with the faction and who they are before the events of Battle for Azeroth so you have a connection to what unfolds.<br />
Sharding allows team to take tangible and meaningful places in the world and update them with what is happening in the story.<br />
Flying will unlock in a similar way to Legion and Warlords. Team wants players to get familiarity with the world before being able to fly. They learned from Legion though and will tweak it as needed.<br />
No plans to have followers or missions at the moment. Team doesn't want to hold on to something for the sake of holding on to it. They want it to work with the story and new content.<br />
World quests will extend to the continent not explored by your faction. (i.e Horde: Kul Tiras and Alliance: Zandalar)<br />
New World PVP concept could allow (tentatively) for things like bounties in which the longer and more dangerous you become on the opposite faction's continent, the more the other faction is alerted to your presence and encouraged to take you down. (Might not happen)<br />
New AI allows players who don't PVP to experience what PVP is like without fighting actual players.<br />
Brawls will continue, but not sure on how much it will be expanded.<br />
Soloing old content will still be fine with the scaling tech, however, one expansion back could still pose a challenge.<br />
Classic servers are still super early in development and so not much is known outside of them happening.<br />
Allied races are super fun and people will be pleased with them!<br />
Player characters act as heroes from Wacraft 3 in Warfronts<br />

Taliesin and Evitel Interview World of Warcraft producers Ray Cobo and Shani Edwards<br />
Taliesin and Evitel (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiHdR2hAyFEXWCbNQgbu_Dg) interviewed producers Ray Cobo and Shani Edwards.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
No plans for mobile support for Battle for Azeroth at the moment<br />
Azerite is similar to artifact power for this expansion<br />
No plans for paid loot boxes in WoW right now<br />
Circles on the Heart of Azeroth can alternate between damage/healing and utility. Abilities are hand crafted so there isn't much RNG in what you have as options.<br />
Every item in a slot that has the same name will have the same ability options. The higher the ilvl, the better the abilities.<br />
No plans for getting your own boat.<br />
<br />
<br />
FinalBoss Interviews Ion And Alex<br />
FinalBoss (http://finalboss.tv/) sat down with Ion and Alex for an interview as well. Here are the highlights:<br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;iframe width=&quot;900&quot; height=&quot;180&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/XKy6WDwqDsY?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
Team is looking into tweaking the frequency in which warforging/titanforging occurs.<br />
Allied races will get full character kits: their own emotes, their own flirts, funnies, exertions, etc.<br />
Ideally our current legendaries will taper off in their power as you level towards 120. By the time you reach max level, you will want to replace them with better, newer gear.<br />
It would be nice to make flying possible and no loading screen for Silvermoon City but it is not currently slated for the BfA release.<br />
Team is trying to figure out how to deal with Allied races being hero classes. They are talking about allowing Dark Iron Dwarves to be Death Knights.<br />
It’s possible that there will be some form of missions moving forward. However, it won’t be a central feature like in Warlords.<br />
The faction divide is key to the game. That is what makes Warcraft Warcraft. It is not expected to be broken in the future.<br />
They have talked about plans for Wrathion for various other things, but currently have no plans for him in BfA.<br />
As of now, Warfronts are PVE only.<br />
For some classes, their artifact abilities will be incorporated into the spec as baseline or a talent. Others will be eliminated altogether.<br />
There is a prevalence of immunities/defensives and the team wants to revisit these and make changes where it makes sense.<br />
No plans to re-envision the Moonkin model as of now.<br />
No class changes as drastic as Survival Hunters are being planned at this time.<br />
The story will definitely build up to a major threat. It will be a ‘slow burn’ that escalates as the expansion progresses.<br />
The profession rank system is likely staying. The amount of quest content tied to them may go down, however.<br />
They want to give players options to customize their gear and keep crafting relevant.<br />
Arcane Torrent and Rocket Jump are being looked at for a re-design.<br />
<br />
<br />
Blue Posts<br />
Artifact Ability and next expansion<br />
We haven't nailed down the specifics on which artifact abilities and traits will be carried forward into the next expansion, though we have heard from players that some traits feel like core parts of their rotation now. So, where possible (and feasible), we will be looking into carrying over those traits as talents or passives. Note, this doesn't mean that everything will be carried forward.<br />
<br />
Look for more specifics on this as we head into beta which, before you ask, I don't have a date for yet either. Soon™<br />

Can they please not. Those don't need changes at all. It'll cheapen the &quot;hero&quot; classes. Demon Hunter uniqueness stems from being night elf and blood elf only and the entire concept of PC Death Knight is contained in the starting zone, which is where no allied race revealed so far fits. Dark Irons fit the most of them all, but still it's a huge stretch. If they fucked up with plausible class combinations for the new races, so be it, but don't cheapen the classes that have a strong lore behind them.</div></div><hr />

As for Avatar...the old magic number was 6 stack (= 60% less healing). Now, we can ramp that up to 8 stacks (64% less healing) which frees up 1 extra player in a beam soaking rotation.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BergErr</div><div class="date">2017-11-07, 03:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Why 3 tank?<br />
<br />
3 tanking is a strat many use because you have one tank handling adds and doing big soak all the time. It put less risk on the main tanks and frees up immunities.<br />
Also ideally adds a roar unless your two maintanks were druid.</div></div><hr />

I hope they do. I would just shove my money in their face to make my dk a zandalari troll. It's the only reason I would even change my race at all......I love the look of the model. I think the 'cheapen' aspect isn't even relevant in regards to players being able to have more customization that way.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Marrilaife</div><div class="date">2017-11-07, 04:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Why 3 tank? The current fotm setup is 2 bears + blood dk, 2 bears for roars (both with talent increasing radius and reducing cd) helping with soaks, knockbacks, rifts in p3 and whatnot, and the dk to massgrip adds so you can burst them and skip half the knockbacks in darkness phase. So since you have this dk as a grip bot anyway you might as well use him to run around and soak the big circles. 1 tank can't soak anyway due to felclaws, other had the boss on him. So you had either a dk + immunity class soak or a dk + active tank soak. I think also second tank add in p2 coincides with a soak? So there are some &quot;funny&quot; overlaps. <br />
<br />
Also since dps requirements got lowered by nerfing hp of the boss and adds, it's not really a problem to bring in a 3rd tank. It's similar situation like Cenarius or Desolate Host - because why not.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Void Elves and Nightborne Demon Hunters would still fit the whole &quot;blood elf and night elf only&quot; fantasy, then. It's certainly not far-fetched to think that Demon Hunters would be willing to embrace the powers of the void as well as the powers of the Legion. There were plenty of the Nightborne who openly accepted the Legion's &quot;gift&quot;. They are no different from any other elf Demon Hunters. As long as they make sure they start out after the events of Legion, the lore would be intact.<br />
<br />
As far as Death Knights go, Highmountain Taurens and Army of the Light Draeneis wouldn't make sense but Zandalari Trolls and Dark Iron Dwarves would fit. The Zandalari fought wars on the Eastern Kingdoms. If the Lich King could raise a long-dead Sindragosa, why wouldn't he be able to raise long-dead Zandalari warriors to fight for him? All they'd need to do is skip the cheesy &quot;old friend&quot; quest and it wouldn't be any different from any of the other races.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, the point is that the players who play Death Knights feel very uninterested with one of the big features of the game ever since Cata. Pandas couldn't be Dks so no point in getting hype. Demon Hunters maybe new main? But for DK players who aren't trying to change: Nothing. Now, we have allied races which can't be dks. 6 whole brand new races we will never care about. So... that's why people are asking about it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
we have heard from players that some traits feel like core parts of their rotation now.<br />
<br />
&quot;We heard from players that&quot;... There are like tons of previous characters' passives that were incorporated as weapon talents. For example, being able to stack 2 Fingers of Frost, they want us to believe that's a completely new thing brought by Ebonchill ? Please<br />
<br />
Plus, I believe that tons of defensive cooldowns were heavily nerfed due to artifact passives. If they disappear, the cooldowns should be tweaked back. Dispersion for example, it sucks now with its 60% damage reduction (+ Silence lololol eat that n00b), but I guess it has to do with its heavily reduced cooldown. If the cooldown goes back to pre-Legion, it should be brought back to 90% at least (or just remove it, I don't know).</div></div><hr />

<br />
How about leaving Rocket Jump, one of the only cool things left in the game, the heck alone? That sounds like a winning idea. Maybe just design fights well in the first place instead. KJ wasn't bad because of a racial.</div></div><hr />

There can't be Nightborne demon hunters because the Nightborne were in Suramar when Illidan's demon hunters were attacking Mardum during the events of Black Temple. And void elves didn't exist yet.<br />
<br />
In a capsule without having to fit into the game's defined narrative, there are all sorts of completely viable ways to justify any class/race combo. A few Nightborne could have join the Illidari after Illidan killed Gul'dan. Bolvar could have his DKs raise a recently slain void elf. Zandalari Demoniacs could rise up to fight the Legion invasions and find common ground with the Illidari. There could be Zandalari warriors who worship Bwonsamdi and have power over death.<br />
<br />
But that's not the world we live in.</div></div><hr />

I started playing in WotLK and I remember cartographer being the most popular addon. Wasn't it available back in vanilla?<br />
<br />

<br />
Alex and Ion trying to pretend Wrathion isn't going to have a role, when Red Shirt Guy already confirmed he's backing Anduin in BfA, and is with the leader's in the embassy. Gotta love it.<br />

Well, disinformation at this year's blizzcon was real. I wonder what's the reason behind it...</div></div><hr />

AT is fine? What the fuck are you smoking? It's by far the best racial for PvE, especially M+. <br />
<br />
Horde race bias towards BElf this expansion is not because they are the &quot;pretty race&quot;, it's because of their racials.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stormykitten</div><div class="date">2017-11-07, 02:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Regarding racials. It's hard to say what is worse, that those two racials have so much impact in their frankly fun design, or having them be yet another casualty for that 1% playerbase.</div></div><hr />

Its the strongest racial out there and completely destroys balance in pve and especially m+. <br />
<br />
Groups shouldnt be forced to play horde to be competetive in m+ especially when there are more tournaments coming. Just look at the m+ leaderboards for a second.. its all bloodelfs stacked at the top. <br />
<br />
Who thought giving a race a 90 second cooldown mass aoe silence with build in resource gain was a good idea... you just have to look at what other races get for their racials and compare it to this lul. Blizz is stupid.</div></div><hr />

This. 80% of my quest I just used thotbott. <br />
<br />
I can't wait for people who have never played Vanilla (although they claim otherwise) to get a taste of classic.<br />
They'll start to miss most of the QoL changes, trust me. Not all, but most.</div></div><hr />

They want to avoid dealing w/ &quot;but you promised us...&quot; crowd, so this time around they only talk about stuff that's already there and hopefully won't be cut.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hopefully never. Who would ask such a question and why?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The profession rank system is likely staying. The amount of quest content tied to them may go down, however.<br />
<br />
Legion was finally bringing some change to it, but looks like it will get downgraded once again. No love for professions :/ sigh</div></div><hr />

No shit! Why in the world would anyone want that? At least they ought to have phrased it like &quot;We haven't got loot boxes in WoW atm, please tell us that you're not going to put that horrendous practice in the game.&quot;</div></div><hr />

The very vocal like Aehl do. They seem to be too preoccupied in their blood lust against PVP realms. Not like they havent continued to throw money at Blizzard despite shitting on the game for over a decade.</div></div><hr />

Who would ask such a question and why? I think I've seen it asked in the Taliesin &amp; Evitel interview, they're a bit of jokesters, but in fact I'm glad to hear the confirmation lootboxes aren't coming, because many were worried about it after Legion full of RNG and &quot;Diablocraft&quot; and seeing how well lootboxes fare in other Blizzard games like Overwatch and HOTS one can wonder... The answer was &quot;the current reward system in WOW is fine without lootboxes&quot; and I agree with that stance. They're making enough money off WOW how it is, don't try to &quot;fix&quot; what isn't broken.</div></div><hr />
