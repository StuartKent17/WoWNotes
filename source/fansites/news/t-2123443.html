PTR Build Deploy - 11/28/2016<br />
Greetings all,<br />
<br />
In a few moments, the PTR realms will be coming down in order to deploy a new 7.1.5 build. No ETA for today's push however I'll update the thread if things look like they're going to take longer than usual (&gt;6 hours). <br />
<br />
I'll leave this thread open for discussion so long as conversations remain civil and adhere to forum guidelines.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your patience!<br />
<br />
Greetings PTR friends,<br />
Things are taking a bit longer than expected with this push. Realms are still up with the previous build, so expect some downtime tomorrow when the deploy starts up again. <br />
<br />
Thanks again for your patience!<br />
<br />
<br />
Kirin Tor Emissary Quests<br />
Just a quick note to say that there was indeed an issue over the weekend with Kirin Tor Emissary being active, but not enough Kirin Tor quests being available.<br />
<br />
We deployed a hotfix yesterday that automatically gives completion credit for the Kirin Tor Emissary upon logging in.<br />
<br />
This a temporary fix, we're resolving the underlying problem so that next time the Kirin Tor Emissary is active there will be enough Kirin Tor quests available to complete the Emissary Quest.<br />
<br />
Apologies for the understandable confusion and frustration this caused.<br />
<br />
<br />
Blue Tweets<br />
was mentioned, as well as numerous bug reports from our guild. Exorsus and From Scratch reported as well and reported as well<br />
Did they? Not that I'd seen. But regardless, not fixing the bug or realizing its severity is on us. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/802918311583330304))<br />
None of us is happy with this outcome; but our mistake doesn't excuse or justify others'. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/802918544526561281))<br />
<br />
Hey, is the TCG considered canon to WoW?<br />
Nope! It's more like a mini-game played within WoW, hence the Innkeeper telling you all of these great stories (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/803014841870917632))<br />

One of the blues probably needed that boss for an item and thought we wouldn't notice....<br />
<br />

2x Withered J'im in a row was a &quot;mistake&quot; though.<br />

No that's Na'zak the Fiend which is located in Suramar (when he's up).<br />

<br />
But notice, besides Withered Jim which they put in twice, that since we got the 8, now it's suddenly giving us a boss we already have had. So, it's possible that it could of been on a pattern to give 8 different bosses to get the achievement, now it's going to go through that cycle again. We'll have to see if it's the same boss again next week that we had week 2. Just seems funny that after the achievement we have a boss again we already had. Like they want to stretch it out. They say it's random, but how can we really know?</div></div><hr />

They should cycle through all the world bosses. It's dumb we're already getting repeats when there are so many bosses...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Personally I think it would be better to spawn more than one worldboss each week. Something like 3 seems to be reasonable... And then cycle it...</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree though I think they should spawn world bosses on a random daily rotation so that there's someone different up every day (but still has the risk of having something like Nithogg twice up during the week) and an a npc that gives a hint as to who will be up tomorrow. Then have the world boss kill WQ be offered by someone like Khadgar and it's to kill only one of the major targets during the course of that week. Additionally the target killed for that quest is the only one that drops loot and gives credit for the achievement and also the quest has an instant completion rather than needing to be turned in so it doesn't risk people trying to game it for loot or achievement progress. That way people can choose what boss they want to kill that week as well as progress on their achievement at their own pace instead of risking another two weeks of Jim or Nithogg up twice in an eight week period.</div></div><hr />

I would suspect you could just set your Loot Preference to &quot;Fury&quot; and spec Prot for the kill if you want to do it as Prot.</div></div><hr />

No, you don't have to. I got my drop from the boss when i am on my Arms spec and loot preference set to Arms.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
all hidden artifact skins (assuming the conditions are met) can be looted as any spec, however to &quot;equip&quot; them you must be specced into that particular skins specialisation.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As i sit here and re-read my comment and read your response, i am reminded of my own recent acquisition of the Havoc hidden artifact appearance. I leveled up my DH as Vengeance and have dumped most of the AP into that artifact. So when i went to fight the mob that drops the Havoc appearance, i did it as Vengeance and got the artifact item with loot set as Vengeance.<br />
<br />
I can't believe it didn't occur to me before i posted my first post, lol.</div></div><hr />
