Ulduar Testing - PTR Schedule<br />
Here's the current schedule for Ulduar PTR testing this week:<br />
<br />
On the North American test realms:<br />
<br />
Flame Leviathan (Normal, i.e. 10 Player Mode ONLY) - Tuesday Night, March 3 at 4PM PST (or after the PTR servers come back up) through tomorrow. We want a lot of testing on this, but take note that the Heroic version of this fight should NOT be tested at this time. Players should only form 10 player raids to test this. The Heroic/25 Player version is not properly tuned.<br />
Ignis the Furnace Master - Wednesday night, March 4, starting at 7pm EST/4pm PST.<br />
Hodir - Thursday night, March 5, starting at 7pm EST/4pm PST<br />
<br />
On the European test realms:<br />
<br />
Flame Leviathan (Normal, i.e. 10 Player Mode ONLY) - Wednesday Morning, March 4 at 01:00 CET (or after the PTR servers come back up) through tomorrow. We want a lot of testing on this, but take note that the Heroic version of this fight should NOT be tested at this time. Players should only form 10 player raids to test this. The Heroic/25 Player version is not properly tuned.<br />
Thorim - Thursday night, March 5, starting at 7pm CET.<br />
Freya - Friday Night, March 6, starting at 7pm CET.<br />
<br />
We should have General Vezax (EU), XT-002 Deconstructor (US), and Razorscale(EU) available for testing soon after this.<br />
<br />
This schedule could change at a moment's notice due to server, bug, or patch status. I'll try to keep everyone informed as much as possible. Ulduar and the bosses to be tested will remain also open a variable length of time. How long they stay open depends upon a host of factors including designer availability, bug status, etc.<br />
<br />
We also hope to have the zone open on off days for each respective realm for a longer period of time. We have a couple special versions of Patchwerk setup. One of them is called Patchwerk (DPS Test) and is essentially a massive training dummy for your raids. The other is Patchwerk (Tank Test), and he does not have a Hateful Strike, but his melee damage increases over time.<br />
<br />
We're very interested in seeing combat logs and parses for all raid testing on the PTR.</div></div><hr />

Exactly what i thought. I wonder if there will be eleschaman nonset hitgear in ulduar, in naxx there isnt a single piece...</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Some how I doubt it... most likely will be stuck with using all our sockets for hit, or fighting every other caster for a +hit trinket.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Would have been nice to have hit on the caster gear ???<br />
<br />
<br />
That is another good point. As important as hit is, they really did a bad job putting on badge gear. I can only assume that there is better than badge gear loot in Ulduar.</div></div><hr />

<br />
JC only gems that are worse than the current JC-only gems with a stricter equip limit...?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I say it's quest rewards. :)<br />
<br />
Then they wouldn't need to be unique-equipped. Unless it was repeatable, which kind of defeats the purpose of limiting them to one equipped.<br />
<br />
The obvious solution is that Stormjewels will drop from Ulduar trash or purchasable for emblems.</div></div><hr />

<br />
QFT. Sigh... when will Blizzard learn that spirit = fail for casters and rename those 'healer' cloth.<br />
<br />
And yeah, Ele Shamans screwed again. I guess just get your T8.5 Set Gloves, and pray Blizzard doesn't screw those up with MP5 or some other garbage.<br />
<br />
I wish they'd at least add some BoE gear to the vendor so I have something to spend my Emblems of Conquest on to either gear up alts or sell.<br />
<br />
Oh, and GG casuals... no more gear progression for you. If you're done running all the heroics, you might as well go play something else until next xpac.</div></div><hr />

Valor: Naxx etc &amp; Ulduar 10.<br />

<br />
exactly! 1 Tier higher.. 10man Ulduar ilvl equals to 25man Naxx, and 25man Ulduar is 1 ilvl Tier higher than Naxx 25. And ofc the endboss will be ilvl 226 in 10man, and ilvl 239 (?) in 25man.... can't wait to see THOSE items. ::)<br />
<br />
but back to &quot;topic&quot;... I don't think anyone will be upgrading from 5man heroic rewards to 25man Ulduar rewards... but good luck, if you trying it!</div></div><hr />

- Emblem of Heroism Rewards<br />
- &quot;Heroes&quot; Tiered Set<br />
- Heroic Dungeons<br />
- Naxxramas<br />

<br />
iLvl 239:<br />
- 3.2 Raid Final Boss<br />
- Icecrown<br />
<br />
iLvl 252+:<br />
- Arthas<br />

<br />
<br />
25-Man Progression<br />

We can safely assume that Ulduar 10 will drop Emblems of Valor, allowing access to the equivalent iLvl 213 loot. However, this means that iLvl 213 variations of the Wayward Tiered set will need to be added to the Valor Emblem Vendor. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh, and GG casuals... no more gear progression for you. If you're done running all the heroics, you might as well go play something else until next xpac.<br />
How so? I think alot of people tend to misinterpret the term &quot;casual&quot; as derogatory. I'm a casual by all means. I'm in a two-man joke guild and the only raids I attend are the occasional pugs every second weekend or so. This hasn't hindered my gear progression whatsoever; allowing me to pickup the best-in-slot weapons for both my main and my alt. I've also successfully tanked OS3D and picked up the Nightfall title on my Paladin alt. It has 2.5 days /played at 80.<br />
<br />
Casual doesn't mean bad player. Casual means the player isn't strictly bound to a group/guild/schedule.<br />
<br />
It's not fun being judged and dismissed by the number of hours you commit to the game each week. Skill does not equal time invested.</div></div><hr />

Don't forget that 11 of the bosses will have hard modes that most likely will drop items one tier above their usual loot. In other words a lot of the bosses in 25-man Ulduar will drop ilvl 239 loot if you do them on hard. And if Yogg-Saron have a hard mode he will probably drop some ilvl 252 items.<br />
<br />
And I guess it is the same for 10-man.<br />

<br />
<br />
Not necessarily. With Valor you can obtain a tier shoulder + pants, and by pugging Ulduar-25 you would be able to get a chest + headpiece of said shoulder/pants same ilvl, making for 4/5 of your pieces easily covered.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Uh, QQ much? PVP gear has plenty of hit rating.<br />
<br />
Deadly ring, neck, and cloak all have hit rating (38 each). You also get hit rating from your weapon chain, that's 142. Use either a Surge Needle Ring or Accuracy (25 hit) on your other weapon and that's 174/167 and you're at the cap.<br />
<br />
If you can't cap in PVE gear, well then I dunno what to say. In the worst case scenario, use the PVP gear I talked about and spec Focused Aim, there's your 8%. You're wrong about that PVE cap, the miss chance is 8% against +3 mobs now (not 9%), it lowered by 1% from BC-&gt;Wrath.<br />
<br />
5% is hardly &quot;alot&quot; (sic) of sacrifice to make, and it's misleading to say that in the first place. 1) Everyone sacrifices it, you're not special. 2) The way itemization works, you get more total if you split the item points on a single piece into many different stats.<br />
<br />
No, Blizzard is fine with RNG, please read the Blue posts. They just don't like RNG that decided the outcome of an arena match in a single roll, which in their eyes is random stun procs.<br />
<br />
They WANT some RNG to stay in the game, like crits. Hit is basically the same thing as crit (100%-&gt;200% damage on any single crit from crit rating and 0%-&gt;100% damage on any single hit from hit rating), so no, it's retarded to suggest they make all classes have 100% hit in PVP and against boss mobs.<br />
<br />
I notice you QQ a lot, normally it doesn't bother me b/c the changes you're complaining about ARE ridiculous, but this is a little over the top.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

huh? What does pugging Ulduar 25 (lol @ that btw) have to do with Valor badges? Ulduar 25 drops Conquest badges, AND Ulduar 25 drops a totally different tier and item level than Valor badges. Ulduar 25 = Badges of Conquest = ilvl 226 T8. Valor = ilvl 213 T7 and ilvl213 T8.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You will be able to PuG Ulduar. Blizzard's idea for this instance being tough is that it will be a higher learning curve than it was going from heroics to Naxx and for hardcore raiders is doing hard mode bosses, that is it. They never said it would be impossible and it is in their interest to keep the large number of casual people running the new content.</div></div><hr />

will be a slight increase in dps (10-30 dps increase). If your equip is in a range where T7 Set-Bonus is still a factor OR you still need the +hit,<br />
then the new items are definitely a downgrade (Malygos-Belt -&gt; Badge-Waist is a downgrade, T7 Legs-&gt;Badge Legs = +10 dps if you do not<br />
count in T7 4-Set, if you count it in, it is -dps, same about T7 Hands, just +19 dps this time, Neck is -dps compared with Malygos Quest Reward).<br />
The new Craftables are a bit better.Crafted Belt is Malygos-Belt+9 dps, Crafted Boots are actually quite good, they are Loatheb-Boots+50 dps.<br />
The question is: If the stuff is &quot;mostly worthless&quot; while you still equip Valorous T7, won't it be even more worthless once you have access to T8?</div></div><hr />

Blizzard's idea for this instance being tough is that it will be a higher learning curve than it was going from heroics to Naxx and for hardcore raiders is doing hard mode bosses, that is it. They never said it would be impossible and it is in their interest to keep the large number of casual people running the new content. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I am sure there still will be alot of self-centered guilds out there that will only go with their people and not have to pug spots in their raids. But I am also sure for the rest of the WoW community, you will still be able to go to Dalaran and the other cities and see people LFG for Ulduar.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MuTe</div><div class="date">2009-03-04, 03:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Uh, QQ much? PVP gear has plenty of hit rating.<br />
<br />
Deadly ring, neck, and cloak all have hit rating (38 each). You also get hit rating from your weapon chain, that's 142. Use either a Surge Needle Ring or Accuracy (25 hit) on your other weapon and that's 174/167 and you're at the cap.<br />
<br />
If you can't cap in PVE gear, well then I dunno what to say. In the worst case scenario, use the PVP gear I talked about and spec Focused Aim, there's your 8%. You're wrong about that PVE cap, the miss chance is 8% against +3 mobs now (not 9%), it lowered by 1% from BC-&gt;Wrath.<br />
<br />
5% is hardly &quot;alot&quot; (sic) of sacrifice to make, and it's misleading to say that in the first place. 1) Everyone sacrifices it, you're not special. 2) The way itemization works, you get more total if you split the item points on a single piece into many different stats.<br />
<br />
No, Blizzard is fine with RNG, please read the Blue posts. They just don't like RNG that decided the outcome of an arena match in a single roll, which in their eyes is random stun procs.<br />
<br />
They WANT some RNG to stay in the game, like crits. Hit is basically the same thing as crit (100%-&gt;200% damage on any single crit from crit rating and 0%-&gt;100% damage on any single hit from hit rating), so no, it's retarded to suggest they make all classes have 100% hit in PVP and against boss mobs.<br />
<br />
I notice you QQ a lot, normally it doesn't bother me b/c the changes you're complaining about ARE ridiculous, but this is a little over the top.<br />
<br />
<br />
huh? What does pugging Ulduar 25 (lol @ that btw) have to do with Valor badges? Ulduar 25 drops Conquest badges, AND Ulduar 25 drops a totally different tier and item level than Valor badges. Ulduar 25 = Badges of Conquest = ilvl 226 T8. Valor = ilvl 213 T7 and ilvl213 T8.<br />
<br />
<br />
Define the difference between QQ and stating an opinion. Imo QQ = complaining about other classes, and calling out nerf. What i am doing is giving my opinion about my own class.<br />
Now about hitrate on PVP gear, i never had to choose between Hit or Crit. Both were represented since seasons 3 and 4 on PVP gear, so in that case i now do have to sacrifice stats in order to cap. And other classes will also, but thats besides the point, and i havent said they didnt.<br />
<br />
In TBC i had a crit chance of 42% and hit capped as BM with at the end of S4 with maxed out PVP gear. Now im at 36% crit at maxed out Deadly gear, and are hit capped thx to Focused aim and Accuracy on 2 handers. But im Survival specced now wich gives some extra crit chance. As BM i have a 32% crit chance, thats 10% less then i was as lvl 70. The burst has gone up, and hp didnt scale well with that in arena. Blizzard stated the next season HP will scale more, and burst will go down. PVP gear will become better, and weapons are comparable to Ulduar weapons. This give me the impression that they are trying to fix the flaw by just sitting the current mistake out, and wait for the next season.<br />
<br />
Most top rated hunters are Naxx geared, and barerly wear resilience. PVE gear has more hit rate on them, and if you do arena in it you dont need that much as you just stated. The miss chance is not 8% but 8.something %, and 9 to be sure u are capped. I dont mind not being capped. I was merely stating that pvp gear has bad itemization, plus the fact there are no weapons available at savage/hatefull level, and even deadly arent competitive compared to raid weapons.<br />
<br />
Doesnt RNG on crit / hit decide the outcome of a match? When i miss my killshot, i believe it does. Same with the fact if it crits or not. This was not a QQ, just an opinion and a personal obervation from playing arena at high ratings wearing PVP gear.</div></div><hr />

I could see these new items being on par with naxx-25 or slightly better at best.<br />

You get badges from killing bosses.. so why should the gear not be on the same level as the gear that drops off the bosses with the badge?!?</div></div><hr />

<br />
PvE vs. PvP is Damage vs. Survivability.<br />
<br />
So it's basically Hit vs. Resilience and dmg stats (i.e. STR on plate) vs. Stamina<br />
<br />
Blizzard did all that wrong in TBC, giving way too much Hit rating on pvp gear (that's one of the reasons why ppl would prefer the easy to get PvP gear over PvE gear, even with the wasted budget on Resilience, you still get an epic gear with a good amount of dmg, high CRIT, stamina and HIT rating).<br />
<br />
For some class/specs, it was even easier, like ret paladins, since they didn't had that much Hit on Tier gear (and none on S1/S2, but a good chunk of STR, even more than Tier 4/5 sometimes) and you could use all +hit pieces from both sets (i.e. T6 pieces + S3 pieces) since they probably never used the same gear slots on same Tier/Season (Blizzard wanted to do that or was just lucky?)<br />
<br />
Now they're doing it right, you don't want to use PvP gear on PvE because now that wasted budget on resilience is a heavy burden on your dps + no hit.<br />
<br />
They just need to fix the other way (pve to pvp) since it's not that easy to choose between high dmg pve gear vs. pvp gear FOR pvp.</div></div><hr />

If you're done running all the heroics, you might as well go play something else until next xpac.<br />
<br />
<br />
This is so incredibly funny. You see the problem is that the comments from test realm about Uludar is that its a joke on normal mode. They aren't going to suddenly turn up the difficulty. They are going to keep it the way it. Uludar will be a JOKE on easy mode. People don't want to admit it but it will be. The best gear will be from hard mode and that is what most guilds will go after. However, casuals will clear Uludar on easy mode in pugs probably 2 months after it is out. You fail to realize that Blizzard learned where their money actually comes from and spends much more time keeping those players happy then wasting time on your hardcore attitude.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daez</div><div class="date">2009-03-04, 06:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Talking about being the same sort of pieces, necklace and belt, and tier chest. Also the fact that it's only ilevel 226, most of them are barely upgrades to heroic Naxx gear.<br />
<br />
<br />
Uludar 10 is 213. Uludar 25 will be 226 except the last boss (most likely) which will be 239 and then hard mode loot will probably also be 239. Right now KT loot, 2drakes (25), and Malygos are all 226. Blizzard is not making huge item jumps in Wrath. Then again, they didn't really make that huge of item jumps in TBC either.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
This is so incorrect its not even funny. If you know how to play your class and are familiar with other people's classes then you don't need &quot;synergy&quot; to be successful. You just need to know what the hell you are doing and be familiar with what the hell others should be doing. If anything, it is scrub guilds that fail at running content because of a lack of synergy. These same scrub guilds are made to look even worse by GOOD pugs. Yes you can have good pugs and BAD guilds.</div></div><hr />

You are going to base this on emblem of conquest rewards when there are 14 bosses in Uludar, 1 in VoA 2.0, and probably one in OS 2.0 (if it exists which I just assume it does). That is kind of a huge stretch. It might be that they simply don't want these items to be best in slot so they are going out of their way to make sure that they aren't for most classes, but undoubtedly 1 or 2 of these items will probably end being best in slot just like at 213.</div></div><hr />

Actually that's not Elemental gear. MP5 is for healers. Elemental Shamans don't need it what-so-ever. There hasn't been any Emblem gear for Elemental Shamans starting with Emblems of Valor. Thanks Blizzard &gt;:(</div></div><hr />

Yeah, I think Blizzard needs to give clothies a variety of choice - either a tunic OR a robe when selecting gear. It's just one of those customization things that I would really like to see happen.</div></div><hr />

Now this is an intelligent post. I've have been think about this for years since WoW first started. I know there are options in the game menu to allow to display or not display your gear from your perspective. But, other players can see your gear as long as they have their option set to display them. As far as this post is concerned, they make a great point. What is the point in making the gear look all pretty and fancy, when your robes will simply cover everything. Unless the robes themselves are open to display what your are wearing underneath. <br />
<br />
And a funny thought came across my mind. I was playing Dragon Quest VIII on the PS2 the other day while the servers were down. I am hoping WoW eventually comes out with either boxers or lingerie for tailors to make. Be real funny to running around and see a tauren or another off the wall race wear boxers or lingerie LOL</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Celeste</div><div class="date">2009-03-05, 10:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No, ulduar gear requires new badges that drop on ulduar<br />
<br />
<br />
I think what he meant was, currently, you can buy T7.5 and Naxx level gear with Emblems of Valor. When Ulduar comes out, T8.5 and T8 will come out; since tier 8.5 will be 25, and T8 will be 10m, will T7.5 be removed from the Emblem of Valor vendor. However, since Ulduar 10m and Naxx 25m will use same ilevel gear, then its a safe bet to say that T8 will not be an upgrade to T7.5 other then visuals and 4pc bonus.<br />
<br />
In regards to the rest of the gear, i don't think they are going to add any new Valor item gear besides the T8 pieces. Which means that any gear found in Ulduar 10m will be a sidegrade to Naxx 25. This will probably slow down gear upgrade progression and you wont see the radical jumps as in BC.</div></div><hr />
