Warlords of Draenor - Garrisons: Town Hall / Great Hall<br />
Today we are taking a look at the Town Hall / Great Hall building. This building is a central part of your garrison, where missions take place and where building configurations are changed. <br />
<br />
Upgrading your Town Hall / Great Hall to Level 3 currently costs (http://beta.wowdb.com/quests/36615-my-very-own-castle) 2000 Garrison Resources (http://beta.wowdb.com/currencies/824-garrison-resources) and &lt;span class=&quot;money-gold&quot; alt=&quot;g&quot;&gt;5000&lt;/span&gt;.<br />
<br />
Town Hall / Great Hall NPCs<br />
Along with the Architect and Mission Specialist, there are a few other interesting NPCs.<br /> 
<br />
<br />
Blueprints Vendor - This NPC sells blueprints and prices have changed since we last looked at them (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/4056-Stormwind-Repairs-Reagent-Bank-Blueprint-Prices-New-Quests-and-Items-Hogger-Pet). <br />
<br />
Level 2 Small Buildings - &lt;span class=&quot;money-gold&quot; alt=&quot;g&quot;&gt;750&lt;/span&gt;<br />
Level 2 Medium Buildings - &lt;span class=&quot;money-gold&quot; alt=&quot;g&quot;&gt;1000&lt;/span&gt;<br />
Level 2 Large Buildings - &lt;span class=&quot;money-gold&quot; alt=&quot;g&quot;&gt;1500&lt;/span&gt;<br />
Level 3 Buildings - &lt;span class=&quot;money-gold&quot; alt=&quot;g&quot;&gt;1000&lt;/span&gt;<br />
<br />
Innkeeper - This NPC sells a few items to help with garrison invasions, as well as the Excess Potion of Accelerated Learning (http://beta.wowdb.com/items/120182-excess-potion-of-accelerated-learning).<br />
Chronicler - This NPC allows you to watch the cutscenes you see while leveling again.<br />

<br />
Daily Mission<br />
A choice between a solo mission and group mission (http://beta.wowdb.com/quests?filter-currency=-1&amp;filter-search=assault&amp;filter-reqlvl-min=100) is given to you in your Town Hall / Great Hall every day, with the solo mission rewarding 800 Apexis Crystal (http://beta.wowdb.com/currencies/823-apexis-crystal) and the group mission rewarding 1000 Apexis Crystal (http://beta.wowdb.com/currencies/823-apexis-crystal).<br />
<br />
When you arrive at the area, you must fill a progress bar to 100% (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2014/october/objectives.jpg) by killing mobs and interacting with objects in the area. Depending on the quest, mobs may give ~1 percent each while objects will give you ~2-3 percent each.<br />

Tank Squish Changes<br />
So basically you're saying that after this change that you just spoke of...<br />
<br />
1). We will self-heal a lot more in solo/out of combat (so that Ret isn't more survivable than Prot and it ain't taking us 60+ seconds to heal up after combat)<br />
2). We will self-heal about the same during raid content (so tanks aren't overpowered like in MoP)<br />
<br />
Is that about right?<br />
Yes.<br />
<br />
Any thoughts on Resolve's scaling at high levels of damage taken? As of right now, we're getting pretty absurd levels of it in raid situations; even the mythic tank dummy with no stacks takes us about 80-85% of the way to the hard cap on our healing. I don't agree with the folks that say to make it linear (since there needs to be something to account for our better gear scaling this expansion), but even I think that Resolve's scaling is pitiful at high levels of damage taken.<br />
Vengeance was a huge additive increase on a trivial base amount.<br />
<br />
Resolve is a multiplier on a very significant base amount that grows with gear. As your gear improves, that multiplier needs to grow slower in order to produce the same effect. Your gear improving will make those smaller increases in Resolve more meaningful.

Proving Grounds<br />
get silver, but then get 430 heroics gear first? or if geared enough for heroics geared enough 4 gold?<br />
It's the same for all difficulties. You want ilvl 615 for max effectiveness at level 100 (Normal dungeon gear). (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/517024908853772288))<br />
<br />
PvE<br />
a question: lately i've heard that soo mythic will be cross-realm. Does that mean WoD's mythic will be so?<br />
New Mythic tiers will not be cross-realm; that restriction will be removed after some time, likely when the next tier arrives. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/516813548446826496))<br />
<br />
...isn't Mythic aimed for 5 and rarely 4 or 6? I think mentioned something like that earlier this year.<br />
Yes, we view 5 as the target. We'll likely bump the raid damage on several fights that were being widely 4-healed. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/516986787193819136))<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
hey I had seen the ranked arena games are ending when 6.0.2 goes live does this mean conquest gear will be available for honor?<br />
Yes (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/516041874344116224))<br />
<br />
Hey, whats happening to Duels resetting cooldowns? Was very excited for this, but hasn't been working for as long as I've had beta<br />
It won't be ready for Warlords release. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/516694248989552640))<br />
<br />
you snuck resilience into the latest build under the name &quot;player damage reduction level 100&quot;?<br />
It's a bit inside baseball but we may need baseline resil at lower levels and we need that buff to remove it at higher levels. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/516972593560453122))<br />
still no plans for resilience at level 100. Damage pacing feels right for the most part. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/516972806366830592))<br />
<br />
Will Skirmishes be available in 6.0?<br />
yes (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/517006999595544577))<br />
<br />
will players be able to earn honor/anything else from skirmishes in 6.0.2?<br />
yes honor (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/517017291020853250))<br />
<br />
Dont think it'd be a good experience for people who want to pracctice<br />
Playing skirmishes to practice for arena is analogous to playing random bgs to practice rated bgs. Not recommended (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/517019038430801920))<br />
you will have a hidden MMR but high end players should not expect as high level play as rated (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/517019509086257152))<br />
<br />
Lore<br />
Are we going to see the Mantid again? There were a million things you guys did right with em, I couldn't list them all on twitter<br />
They're pretty local to Pandaria. I doubt you'll see much of them anywhere else, but you never know. They can fly, after all. (_DonAdams (https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/516778051469066241))<br />
<br />
How is Khadgar &quot;tirion esque&quot; you mean Cata thrall esque? because he's an alliance character.<br />
He's leading a coalition of Alliance and Horde forces on Draenor. So, pretty much exactly what Tirion did in Wrath. (_DonAdams (https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/517055094248861696))<br />
Or rather, he's trying to get them to cooperate against the Iron Horde. Both factions interact with him to some degree. (_DonAdams (https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/517055719627956225))<br />
<br />
World<br />
Not sure if you're the right person to ask this but is Timeless Isle sticking around going into #Warlords?<br />
Yep, it's not going anywhere. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/516252025982840832))<br />
and it isn't changing? so for instance I can go do all the stuff I never did in MoP in WoD!<br />
Other than some specific things like the legendary questline, everything from Mists will remain for you to explore. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/516253721098211328))<br />
<br />
Garrisons<br />
If you change your garrison outpost , you'll get a new questline with a new follower, right?<br />
No, we didn't want you to have to &quot;collect them all&quot; by systematically replacing each outpost. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/516623617812348928))<br />
<br />
Misc<br />
Yay! Another Blizz representative that's horde ...and you guys still try to deny the bias, pffft!<br />
Actually, the WoW dev team has a pretty even split of Horde and Alliance players. (_DonAdams (https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/517024689131360258))<br />

<br />
Its just something new that hasn't been done before in WoW. Its time consuming but to me doesn't feel absolutely necessary. Yes you get chances at gear but the rarity of getting a raid mission is pretty high. Also being able to craft things that normally you wouldn't be able to do is nice, along with the Mines and Herb garden. <br />
<br />
All I have done in Beta is garrison work because I don't want to spoil to much of the WoD experience before its live. <br />
<br />
But just because I like it doesn't mean every one will.</div></div><hr />

It's something to work on /be proud of i guess, and I find the perks/rewards pretty fun . Ie the waygates sound like they could mix things up a bit and encourage some interesting world pvp , a lot of the world toys sound fun.</div></div><hr />

I plan on power leveling the crap out of it until level 2 (3 is not really needed) then once i have first tier of kit if i even get it all before mythic geared i will leave the garrison alone other than for the free bonus roll token. <br />
<br />
I am sure i won't be the only one doing this ^^ Did the same with farming in MoP and rep farming. Those sorts of grinds are not fun you would think attunments back in Classic/Wrath would have taught them that lesson. Wrath had none of this rubbish and was played and enjoyed by many. <br />
<br />
If the garrisons had been scraped we would have had the game by now and likely some cool features. Instead of we left with crappy garrisons a late release missing models, no flying etc etc So much missed out just for this rubbish.</div></div><hr />

Hopefully it's a sign that gold inflation won't be as big a concern (due to being made the &quot;universal&quot; currency in WoD).<br />
<br />
Also, even though I've played Horde since classic WoW, I just can't like the Horde art as much as I do Alliance. The latter version has a &quot;quintessential&quot; sort of vibe to it, whereas the former simply feels somewhat staid.<br />

<br />
Yes, all the buildings look too much the same. I really hoped they could have gotten a little more creative - and evolve the style of the horde buildings to make them more unique - even blending in some architectural features from some of their ally's (as in friends - not the Alliance). But bland and boring is all they are :(<br />
<br />
Also, Is it really smart putting spikes on the end of everything? Really sick of that. A real waste of peon production resources.<br />
<br />
Time to evolve a little please Horde!!!</div></div><hr />

I agree. I was hoping they'd at least mix up architecture with races that specialize in certain things. Like having the Alchemy lab become some Forsaken lab or the Tannery being Tauren building just like Alliance have a DWARVEN Bunker and not a &quot;Bunker where we make pretty human weps&quot;</div></div><hr />

Its novelty quickly wore off for me. For those who like it, what is it about the feature that you like?<br />
<br />
Most of the features, I guess. I like sending followers on missions, mixing up the best followers for specific missions to increase success, hiring specific followers for that reason. The whole 'feel' of having a little piece of the new world be your own is awesome. Big fan of the perks, too, and the forced choice of not having everything. I like it all. Is there things I find lacking? Absolutely, lots of stuff I'd like added! More costumization options for one and I find the Horde buildings pretty bland and boring compared to the Alliance ones. But in regards to the features that ARE in place - I love them all. Makes the game feel very alive outside of raiding and PvP'ing =)<br />
<br />
It's not for everyone, though, but outside of MMO-Champion the reception of Garrisons seems hugely positive.</div></div><hr />

gold is the new valor points. You get a ton of bonus gold for running random heroics and lfr's and such. you'll have a ton more gold in WoD. If it helps, just pretend the gold you get from queuing is valor and focus on how many heroics you would need to run to save up for such and such, and it's exactly like valor but with a different name and more versatile.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you see two people in the oval office: <br />
<br />
The first one sitting behind that prominent desc, drinking from a cup of coffee abviously at ease, staying seated when the second enters. <br />
The second one meekly approaching quietely handly some paperwork, standing in front of the desc the first one is seated behind, then leaving, while the first one never even cares for a greeting or any form of aknowledgement unless direclty adressed.<br />
<br />
Whom would you guess was the president and whom was the secretary doing the grunt work?<br />
<br />
Now tell me, if we are to allegedly be 'commander', why is someone else seated in the most prominent position in the whole garrsion? It is placed on a dais, a throne would not look out of place there.<br />
<br />
Why isn't she moved to the side, where she belongs and a chair and nice neat desc (almost completely empty of paperwork) acting as our mailbox is put in its place for us, to generate the feeling that 'this is our place as the commander of this garrsion, where we would sit and work if not for delegating all that trivial paperwork to our assistant Luitenant Thorne. Leaving only our personal mail, from our friends and buissnes associates so we do not have to run outside to the mailbox and stand in the open while managing our correspondence.<br />
Because this is supposed to be our Garrsion, where we are in command, the place where we get the best spot and have others who do the menial work for us.<br />
<br />
Instead there is Luitenant Thorne, sitting where the one in command of any military or civilian outpost of the Alliance would be placed, giving the feel of just another random quest hub somewhere in the world, where we just happen to pass through if we are looking for something to do. She is even passing out quests to us (for our followers to do, but still).</div></div><hr />

I can understand that sentiment. As a worgen I pretty much get shoved wherever anyway, but I would've like to see some variety. Although we'd be waiting another 6 months for the expac, and I'm already sick to death of SoO. This is our last real week of H progression if patch hits. And while I hope we can get our last two bosses down, I don't deny that after a year of the same raid, dealing with constant roster swaps Bc ppl are bored and quit,.... Yea I'm ready for 6.0 even if it is nothing but a quest line.<br />

Dude get over yourself. I've been playing this game long enough to be fully aware of what it's all about. I wasn't complaining about the stupid garrisons, I was comparing it to the shiny new penny that was the farm. And that's all it is. 1 week of garrisons on beta and that becomes very apparent. It's just dailies in shiny new wrapping paper. Which is fine. <br />
<br />
You think raiding is boring, I think questing is boring. You play your way, I'll play mine. Neither way is wrong. That's the beauty of an MMORG. I especially love the ignore feature....</div></div><hr />

They whine no one will take them into a raid so they can get gear....<br />
<br />
Just spent my whole evening carrying ppl on our alts. I even solo healed the first half to get more in. When it became apparent I couldn't solo heal any farther with the low dps I had to ask Mr 60k dies 30 sec after pull to step out so a guildie could bring another healer alt to help me. He got 3 pieces of gear on his very first raid and I'm an elitist jerk for asking him to step out. That's the attitude these people have.

I for one look forward to getting the dungeon guild achievement that lets me put my guild banners up in the garrison. Having access to tons of mats too while not having to go out and farm from all over is also nice. The quests for followers are interesting, looking forward to seeing what more they can do with it for future patches/expansions. Maybe its the thought that I have my own base that's cool.

I generally prefer the Horde's buildings simply due to the fact that outside the Gnome and Dwarf building every other building is human themed and/or just an ipdated version of a building we've seen for years and ran by humans.

<br />
Frostfire is actually quite barren and beautiful. The reason it might seem depressing is it's almost as barren inside as it is outside the garrison. All the buildings are placed in relatively the same area, so there's no real balance to the area, an invasion can break in and bam, all your buildings accessible right at the front gate, and such. There's no real signs people live there either aside from the obvious &quot;Lok'tar Ogar&quot; setup of the few buildings there. The Alliance feels like it's an actual fort that turns into a fortress, with a good layout, tents, supplies neatly gathered around, and then the flavor, which is a beer garden, a painter in the background behind a building, some little areas to relax, as well as train and work.<br />
<br />
The Horde meanwhile are almost entirely militaristic in their design at the moment, like the dev team was taking inspiration from Garrosh's True Horde rather than Thrall's. Thrall's had tents here and there, fur throws at least for somewhere non rocky to stand, tarps here and there for cover. The Horde Garrison by contrast is snowy, rocky, and the tents that are there in the end are either really your profession buildings, or a few on the side that really don't function as tents. There's nothing filling the outside of the buildings area either, like the Alliance side. Alliance has spare supplies, some chairs, and little details that show people have worked there, Horde.... barren. The Tavern could have done with a tarp covering something like more supplies on the side, and such, but... details. The Horde has a grand location either way, what makes it so depressing, at least to me, is how barren the dev team made it. Orcs are not known for their comfortable culture, but the Dev Team decided to make it &quot;Orc Orc Orc&quot; with just a spice of the Horde's races near the end of the profession buildings. Get some Sin'dorei and Taurahe designs in the side for areas that make it seem like more than just militarized orcs live there. After all, even Honor Hold and Thrall'gar (I think thats the place in Hellfire equal to Honor Hold for Horde) have tents, people working those tents and supplies, and extra things going on around the place. <br />
<br />
And that's a little damn depressing that a half-burnt and half destroyed, last-ditch fort built in a red, sweltering, apocalyptic peninsula has more of a &quot;People exist here&quot; feel than the Horde Garrison.</div></div><hr />
