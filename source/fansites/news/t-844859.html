Ink Traders in Stormwind/Orgrimmar in 4.0.6<br />
Bashiok recently mentioned that Ink Traders will be available in capital cities with Patch 4.0.6. I took the time to check the PTRs and they are now located next to the inscription trainers of Orgrimmar and Stormwind, you no longer have to go to Dalaran to get your precious ink! <br />
Ink Traders are being added to Stormwind and Orgrimmar in 4.0.6. <br />

Real-life Threats<br />
This is a reminder that we take threats made against other players, against our employees, and of self-harm extremely seriously.<br />
<br />
We realize that there can be stressful and trying moments in the game or when interacting with others, but there is no acceptable time to go beyond the boundaries of the game and threaten others with real-life harm.<br />
<br />
If someone is found to be making a real-life threat, we will report it to the authorities, which could result in real repercussions. If you see anyone making a real-life threat against you, themselves, or others, please report it immediately. To report threatening in-game chat, use the in-game petition system by clicking on the red question mark, or for forum posts, use the thumbs-down button and choose ‘Real-Life Threats.’<br />

Tol Barad Issues<br />
I'll try to answer for you what little I can. As I'm sure you've seen, we've made some smaller adjustments to Tol Barad to help some right now, but we know that these changes are just that, minor. That said though, we spent a lot of time developing Tol Barad and want to make sure that it is utilized and enjoyed as originally intended. We are continuing to discuss ways in which we can do this, but it's going to need additional development time. We do have some plans that we'd like to put into play, but I can't enlighten you on what those are as of yet and can only say that they will be done in the future at some point. Unfortunately, I can't give a better time table than that. I know that seems lacking, but Tol Barad is not &quot;out of sight, out of mind for us.&quot; (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/156149/we-would-love-some-dialog-on-tol-barad))<br />

No LVL 85 Food/Water on Mammoth mount vendors<br />
The multi-seater mammoths have a very Northrend-specific feel to them, so we don't necessarily want to just straight update their vendors. We like the idea of having mounts with usable vendors in general, though, and are looking into the possibility of adding new ones in the future (ones that would provide higher level food and drinks). There are already a few ideas incubatin', but nothing that we can reveal just yet. <br />
<br />
[...] Your gold wasn't spent needlessly. The multi-seater mammoth mounts still have a fast run speed, can hold up to three passengers, and allow nearby players to sell and repair their items. That functionality is available to everyone, regardless of when the mount is or was purchased. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/156197/update-vendors-please))<br />

Cataclysm Questing is too Linear?<br />
For Cataclysm, we wanted to create more immersion with better storytelling, and we wanted your characters to feel connected to ebb and flow of Azeroth. This was something we hoped to accomplish through a number of mediums including quests.<br />
<br />
Overall, we think we were successful in achieving those goals and making the leveling experience more story-driven, but we realize we may not have hit the nail perfectly on the head. For example, we've received a lot of feedback that suggests we made questing a bit too linear this expansion, and we're not in total disagreement. It's cool that your character has a visual impact on the world and can watch as key events unfold, sure, but sometimes it can feel a bit awkward when you're unable to explore content at your own pace because you're still locked to a particular phase. We also hear your concerns about cut-scenes, tradeskill nodes, and the effects phasing has on groups.<br />
<br />
We're taking all these criticisms in stride and will be using them to improve the questing experience for future expansions and, to an extent, future patches. When it comes to questing, it's matter of finding a good balance between story and gameplay, and that tightrope can be a hard one to walk. Your feedback keeps us from swaying too far in any one direction, though, so we greatly appreciate threads like this one. Keep it up. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/156134/cataclysm-questing-is-so-linear))<br />

LFD Tool Long Queue Times<br />
There's a false perception that we don't want to change things or iterate on things regularly. This is not true. We are always looking at ways to improve the game and the systems within it. Finding the right solution though doesn't always happen as quickly as some would like, and when trying to account for human nature, things get a bit more difficult to predict. We can only provide the tools, see how things go, iterate on them, and see if things improve for you. But, these things take time and there's an awful lot of differing opinions out there.<br />
<br />
No one is saying, &quot;This is it, take it or leave it&quot;, we're simply saying, &quot;This is our intention. Here's how we designed this to work/play out. Try it out and let us know how it goes.&quot;<br />
<br />
We're still going to keep pushing to do better, to make things as balanced as possible, and to provide an epic and entertaining gaming experience. We just won't be able to do it overnight.<br />
<br />
The Looking For Dungeon queue times are understood to be of issue for some people. If/when we find a better way to get you in to a dungeon quicker, we'll let you know. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/156078/looking-for-dungeon-queues))<br />
<br />
Dungeon Difficulty<br />
That's a pretty heavily stacked way to ask the question, but I'll see if I can provide a satisfying answer anyway.<br />
<br />
As is often the case, the truth is somewhere in the middle. Realistically, I recognize that a lot of the concerns that have been brought to bear address issues beyond dungeon difficulty alone, so, on that basis 'learn2play' isn't a particularly valid argument by itself, no.<br />
<br />
Conversely, (and I think this is what those arguments are really getting at) we're coming from an expansion where, through much of its existence, whole swathes of class abilities - crowd control, certain types of heals - went virtually unused. We've gone from there to a place where if a group doesn't use crowd control, or otherwise employs reasonably good play overall, their chance of success dramatically decreases. We want to reward good gameplay, so the tuning on dungeons is less forgiving than it was. Despite that, as average gear quality and know-how increases, it is inevitable that more and more players will have easier and faster runs over all.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, maybe things have come too far in the other direction. While we're seeing that player assembled groups have very good success, Dungeon Finder groups are having significant issues. That's something we're planning to address.<br />
<br />
The World of Warcraft development team and Blizzard as a whole aren't composed of a single kind of player. We're players of all sorts, we suffer from the same issues (and enjoy the same triumphs) that you guys do. We’re keeping an open mind and taking into account all perspectives as we move into 4.0.6 and beyond.

I agree, all HC's a are piss easy. I have a mage, resto shaman and prot. warrior and i can't say that there is a hard HC. There are few hard achvms like the last boss in The Lost city of Tol'Vir but even 80% of the drake achvms are easy to be done even with Pug's.</div></div><hr />

Yes it won't because the number of tanks will still be minimal compared to the DPS number.<br />
And making 6 man dungeon demands a ground up re-design of dungeon,mechanics,loot even talent trees.<br />

Same can be said for all the people who &quot;Bawwed&quot; heroics were too easy. Weren't they smart enough to create their own challenge? To many people, no one will ever be happy.

as the cata begun i had very frustrating moments when i tanked at the very beginning (taking shit load of dmg, healers were almost or unable to keep me alive even with CC) but as the game progressed at ilvl345+ dungeons became normal even on hc, now at ilvl354 we fly trough all bosses and almost all hcs are effortless<br />
<br />
so yeah blizzard make them harder, heroics need to be heroic<br />
<br />
and one more problem, gearing was intended to be like vanila days but now it's fast and easy almost like wotlk<br />
<br />
end of December, 2010 we already had like 4-5 players with ilvl 350+ pve gear<br />
<br />
you can hit the pve gear top (359) even without raiding alot just TB and daily HC and reps and few BOT trash runs and you are almost ready to go HC raiding, i think that's not normal</div></div><hr />

This is a very good idea. With the difficulty compared to Wrath, a lot of the tanks and healer that were sliding by without knowing what they were doing have given up and switched to DPS, because it's just too &quot;hard&quot;. Therefore, I think some re-balancing may be needed. Whereas five may have been the magic dungeon number in previous expansions, I don't see why it has to stay that way. Adding another DPS and retuning the dungeons to compensate would help a lot with this issue. Though I do feel it's a little sad that even with 60% of group composition being damage dealers, we still have way too many. It just goes to show that people like the idea of smashing stuff and big, flashy numbers more than healing or tanking, which (in my opinion) can be just as rewarding, if not more so. <br />
However, sadly, I do not see them implementing such a feature, as this would require a lot of changes to the way they have things tuned. They would have to redesign the entire dungeon system. =-(</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually, it is slightly harder than that.<br />
<br />
You make the assumption that the numbers of tanks and healers would stay constant.<br />
<br />
However, maybe because there is a extra dps slot per group, some healers and tanks would swich to their dps spec.<br />
<br />
Personnaly, I do believe that it would overall reduce waiting times, but they are other factors to take into account.<br />
<br />
Probably one of the best solutions is for people to be more patients with tanks: as a tank, mistakes go rarely unseen (whereas a dps can screw up this dps cycle on a fight, and no one really knows), and if people would, as the Americans say, &quot;cut him some slack&quot; and not yell at him, even if there is a wipe, more people would be willing to tank, hence less queues<br />
<br />
PS: Heroics are fine, no nerf required. If you can't do them now, wait until the next patch, you will be able to buy 359 gear from heroics and faceroll through them</div></div><hr />

The linearity of questing is not a bad thing. I do understand that players want a reward for understanding the quest line, for knowing what quests to take and what quests to not take. Is perfectly normal to gain some sort of advantage over other players, based on those things. <br />
<br />
This text is taken from a well known webiste, and is about Laina Nightsky NPC:<br />
<br />
<br />
What always happens is, people finish Oh, Deer! and Disrupting the Rituals first, but can't get the next quest until they turn in Black Heart of Flame. However, once you turn in that quest, you aren't close enough to see the quest giver for Last Stand at Whistling Grove, but you DO have a breadcrumb to do the quests to the east, so you end up over there for 30 minutes and then run into a dead-end with no quests.<br />
<br />
You need to go back to Laina Nightsky and pick up Last Stand at Whistling Grove, then everything will continue from there.<br />
<br />
<br />
I just try to point out that this is not the kind of &quot;non-linearity&quot; that I want to see in the game. Searching for 30 minutes for NPCs around Mt. Hyjal is the last thing I wanted to happen to me. This is unacceptable.</div></div><hr />

If you have problems with queue you are obviously a DPS (40min+), as healer you get 3-6min and as a tank you get like 0.2s queue. <br />

Do you play anything other than rogue/mage/lock/hunter? Great, solved for ya... You will have to collect offspec gear if you didnt already but its really easy and you will finally experience something else than retard-role (aka DPS).<br />

Are you a pure DPS class (rogue/mage/lock/hunter)? Oh well your guild must have tanks in it. Or other DPSers with an offspec so ask them to go with you. If they are selfish simply offer to them that you will run this one, then the tank can take his DPS alt and you will take your tank alt.<br />

All mob's hp would have to be higher, so basically they'd not die any faster. If you had problems before (CC), you'll have problems after.<br />
<br />
It would work for people who already have no problems in heroics, which i understood wasn't the majority. Also, you have another stranger in your group, with [b]higher[b] chances of getting a nub/drunk/0/71 spec/ etc.<br />
<br />
Personally, i'd rather say the problem is indeed heroics ARENT rewarding. Running them a few times gives you full 346 and two epics, totally no incentive to keep doing it (unless bored)<br />
<br />
Most of the players left in heroics now are alts or sub-par mains. Adding one slot to that isn't going to be ok, i say.</div></div><hr />

Likewise, all the whiners crying about them being too hard need to man up and try harder. My group of friends has been progressing through heroics slowly but surely. We are not amazingly skilled players, but we aren't terrible either. Just average players. Casual players. But smart casual players, for sure. We seek out upgrades in any way we can, and analyze fights to make sure we don't make the same mistakes over and over.<br />
<br />
If I had to pick one side, I would say the dungeons are too hard, but it's by such a miniscule amount, seriously, it's not even an issue. To be slightly easier would be OK, but I think they are pretty good right where they are at, honestly. Any harder and you might see me complain, though. In other words, it seems like Blizzard did a pretty good job tuning them, and so far I agree with the changes they are putting in. If I had to name one boss in a heroic that I think might need to get knocked about the ears with the nerf bat slightly, it would be Ozruk, and only because it's a bitch for hunters and holy paladins to get away from his Paralyze. Had a hunter in our group tonight on that fight that went to Blackrock Depths and bought the drink in the Grim Guzzler that gives you a DoT. Our healer was a holy paladin, so he just had to keep an eye out and time his judgements perfectly.<br />
<br />
Anyway...<br />
<br />
TL;DR: Quit claiming the dungeons are too hard or easy, they seem just right with very few exceptions. Nerf Ozruk.</div></div><hr />

Weren't they smart enough to create their own challenge? To many people, no one will ever be happy. Not every one likes &quot;Easy&quot; not everyone likes &quot;Hard&quot; forcing them to enjoy something they hate creates massive QQ. Endless cycle.<br />
<br />
&quot;I like it easy&quot;: Normals are that way &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
&quot;I like it challenging&quot;: heroics are that way &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
Simple as that. Just choose your way and play the damn game.<br />
<br />
But, the problem lies in &quot;I like it easy and want everything that ppl who does the challenging way earns without the challenging part&quot;. Solution? Alread given since beta: Next patch valor to justice gear is that way &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;, just wait in the line for 4.1.<br />
<br />
Blizzard statement &quot;maybe things have come too far in the other direction&quot; caving to this kind of customer is really disturbing... looks like they can't handle it for another month (we all know that 4.1 is like Mar/Apr) and are ready to get back to their worst conception of gameplay (WotLK)...<br />
<br />
What is worse... those customers, after QQing their way trough, now easy, heroics, will demand that raids need to be tunned to the new (or old, if we remember wotlk) gamestyle, because it's a stupid leap in dificult from the new lolroics to raid. As soon as they get normal modes &quot;dumbfied&quot; again, they'll say that heroic modes are way too hard compared to normal modes and should be brought down to match the normal/heroic from 5mans...<br />
<br />
All that because they're greedy and lazy ppl who just want the same thing as the players who accepted a challenge proposed by the game instead of QQing &quot;my epix!&quot;. They will cry &quot;you're just a elitist @#$%$#ole&quot; because they won't accept this fact. The choice is there, but they don't want it.</div></div><hr />

This of it this way, u take away 20 int and 20 haste and add a red socket, with the bonus of 10 int. If u put a +40 int gem in that socket u just got 30 int for free. and considering it significantly out-weighs any/all other stats doing anything aside from this is wrong. &lt;3 your free int.</div></div><hr />

Flexibility. You can't pick what hard stats your gear has(aside from reforging some of it), but you can pick your gems.<br />
<br />
Dungeon Queues... as long as the community is, on average, utterly tarded towards tanks and healers, I see not reason for them to pug. I think there are enough tanks &amp; healers about for the most part... if they would be about. Thing is, since both got a bit more challenging in Cat, those that stuck with it probably got(or were in to begin with) good guilds, and hence, do their dailies with guildies. That, and the pointed fact that there are roughly fifteen billion dps for every tank willing to pug. People in pugs seethe so much hate and drivel towards their healers and tanks, I wonder how there still are *any* tanks or healers willing to pug. I play druid healer with tank offspec, and both are reserved for guild only for the aforementioned reasons.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure what Blizz really could do about the long dps queues... those that find healing and tanking fun in the current system already do it; healing and tanking pugs never was and never will be, fun.</div></div><hr />

no, my idea is that, gearing is too fast, rep gaining is not a 100% grind with championing it<br />
<br />
good luck with ramkahen's one daily quest :D<br />
<br />
there should of been like 5 dailies of each faction and that going to exalted will be hard, but with tabards is like one rep a day<br />
then trash runs, you get one/two epics each or almost each run, 10-15 runs provides you with the desirable epic, not more than 3-4 hours of efort<br />
then valor points items you get like 7x70 from dailies and 90 from TolB 580 each week w/o raiding if you add 2-3 bosses it's more and that makes it 2-3 weeks for item if you do not get the drop<br />
from the TolB boss or the 2/3 downed each week<br />
<br />
that makes it if you are semihc or hc player will take you a month or 2 to gear up full 359 epics +- 2 items<br />
<br />
so gearing is way fast</div></div><hr />

No they don't. Seriously.<br />
<br />
hmm you must have a very active guild, or be a tank/healer. Sit in the heroic queue for 45+ minutes, and on the first boss watch the tank get 3 shot, because he makes the gear lvl in his dps gear but his tank gear. Healer quits, 1 dps drops, and the run is over. <br />
<br />
That was a good use of my 45 minutes, and waiting for another healer will take 15+ on my battle group. I love how they are tuned when i get a guild group, it feels like we have accomplished something, but when i'm forced to pug(8 people on, 6 dps and 2 tanks) I would really like to show up, not suck, and get my valor. At my current gearing up rate(1 heroic a week due to time constraints and the long queues), sometime around May I should have the gear to start raiding.<br />

Go wait in the dps heroic queue some time, just to watch the run fall apart 3 pulls in cause the mage sheeps beforeI have sapped, and then the hunters pet is taunting off the tank, and the goes oom... I agree the heroics are right, for a good guild group, but they are too hard for pugs, and after the 45 minute wait to get in, all i want is to get back out in the shortest time possible I've already been playing for an hour by that point.</div></div><hr />

<br />
the lore in wow probably keeps half the people who are on the fence subbed<br />
<br />
the questing is better now than ever, if you don't think so then go kill 87 zebras in the barrens after you slay 76 female lions<br />
<br />
that was how questing WAS, you can quest, you can still grind, pvp level, dungeon level, etc<br />

They did, when cataclysm came out all the new dungeons fixed the dungeon problem i.e. made them fun and challenging unlike the faceroll wrath heroics and you know what? get some gear these new heroics become faceroll at about 350 item level if not before that even.<br />
<br />
Still have to learn how to not stand in crap though, if you stand in crap you might as well quit now cause that doesn't get any easier in raids.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As for the heroics, you should have seen them 14 hours after the launch. People in ICC epics and green leveling gear. Myself as feral tank with unenchanted, ungemmed DPS gear. We used CC and made it through pretty easily, and that was with 4 pugs. No wonder we all either had Scarab Lord or Light of Dawn.<br />
<br />
The gear your random pug have today is miles better, so it's not really the dungeons that need to be fixed.</div></div><hr />

Not everyone wants 40 minute queues then over an hour running Deadmines or Halls of Origination. <br />
Not everyone wants to queue for 40 minutes, only to get into stonecore and wipe over and over again on Corborus. <br />
Not everyone wants to queue for 40 minutes and as soon as everyone finds out they have Grim Batol, they all drop group. <br />
<br />
It's not that they are hard, at least in my case. However having a 4 other people in a PUG that may not be too well geared or not know tactics, DOES make it hard. What they do is out of my control, and that is what makes the new HCs no fun what-so-ever.<br />

<br />
as the cata begun i had very frustrating moments when i tanked at the very beginning (taking shit load of dmg, healers were almost or unable to keep me alive even with CC) but as the game progressed at ilvl345+ dungeons became normal even on hc, now at ilvl354 we fly trough all bosses and almost all hcs are effortless<br />
<br />
so yeah blizzard make them harder, heroics need to be heroic<br />
<br />
and one more problem, gearing was intended to be like vanila days but now it's fast and easy almost like wotlk<br />
<br />
end of December, 2010 we already had like 4-5 players with ilvl 350+ pve gear<br />
<br />
you can hit the pve gear top (359) even without raiding alot just TB and daily HC and reps and few BOT trash runs and you are almost ready to go HC raiding, i think that's not normal<br />
<br />
OK, I'm confused by this. I'm not opposed to current heroic difficulty, but in order to do what you want Blizzard would essentially have to look at the average ilvl of &quot;better&quot; groups and adjust difficulty on monthly or even weekly basis. Ignoring the difficulty of that, it also creates a situation where within a few patch iterations they become impossible in lower ilvl gear. So as people (either new people or alts) level new toons, they will unable to complete heroics for a longer and longer time. Conceivably by the middle of 4.2 you could never do heroics in 333 ilvl gear, even if you completely decked yourself out in it.</div></div><hr />

there's plenty of things to &quot;do&quot; while you wait in queue. You can also take the first 20 minutes (the safest time when it's prooobably not going to pop) and step away from your computer. Just don't be too late or else you'll miss your queue.<br />
Orrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr make a tank offspec, learn to tank in a few regulars, gear up, and help the world out. :3 I admit sometimes i get sick of healing/tanking, but when I do, I'm fully aware that I have no choice but to wait in a long queue. Good healing/tanking is a reward in itself. (It's also the ONLY reward you get, so you just have to deal with it *puts on sunglasses*)<br />
<br />
Thank god for the ink traders in the city. I was being hounded by my husband non-stop about porting him to Dalaran. - Okay, not really, but it DID seem REALLY silly to have to go back to Dalaran to get the new inks (and no real way to get there unless you had a pocket mage).<br />
<br />
Heroics are &quot;tough&quot;, initially, how it should be. Some are worse than others, this is true. But if you're just starting out- flask and food, for cryin' out loud. Have healing pots and mana pots. This helps out a ton. My first heroic ever took about two and a half hours, that's with a guild group, we were all new to it. Now it's a breeze, even with a couple puggers.<br />

I do admit, I'd be willing to do at least the questline if the ENTIRETY OF DEELPHOLM didn't have to be done first.<br />
I'm on my fourth character trying to open up shoulder enchants.... it does, indeed, get pretty bloody frustrating.</div></div><hr />

And before you ask, no, I didn't forget Dragonkiller Tunic / Assassin's Chestplate / Belt of Nefarious Whispers / Corded Viper Belt, they just don't have socket changes (yet?). <br />
OK, Blizzard HAVE to stop with this butthurt behavior of &quot;Screw you Hunters and Druids&quot;. Personal affairs affect professional is just bad.<br />
<br />
<br />
Bashiok recently mentioned that Ink Traders will be available in capital cities with Patch 4.0.6. I took the time to check the PTRs and they are now located next to the inscription trainers of Orgrimmar and Stormwind, you no longer have to go to Dalaran to get your precious ink! <br />
GREAT!!!! Now make Dalaran ink trader trade 10 Ink of the Sea for a Snowfall Ink again. How the hell is a person leveling in Northrend supposed to get Blackfallow Ink for leveling Inscription. Blackfallow for Snowfall makes no sense at all.<br />
<br />
<br />
Cataclysm Questing is too Linear?<br />
Oh come on, now people are just whining for whining... How the heck they are too linear? Perhaps for one every twenty players. But again, why do things that please 1 and displease 19? Right...<br />
<br />
<br />
LFD Tool Long Queue Times<br />
Again..Players that pick hybrid classes fault. Blizzard can't make something that doesn't break things horribly on the other side. People have to start to develop their offspec and queue in something other than DPS, or stop crying. It's totally players' fault.<br />
<br />
<br />
Dungeon Difficulty<br />
On the other hand, maybe things have come too far in the other direction. While we're seeing that player assembled groups have very good success, Dungeon Finder groups are having significant issues. That's something we're planning to address.<br />
That's not mechanics of the fights. One or other fight is too demanding, one or other fight is too easy, but in general PUGs are failing because the horrible implementation of item level. Just admit it, you guys worried too much with end-game and NEVER made the adjustments to content before as you said you would do. Blizzard adjusted all the content pre-raid in the last minute and didn't tested anything. Of course the results were poor.<br />
<br />
The philosophy of &quot;balancing the things players are supposed to spend most time with, and then run back and fix anything we broke behind&quot; was never supposed to work, and never did, and never will. Just drop this crap. Blizzard is just hurting itself.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think this sums it up nicely. All the new zones are like this, both the redesigned old world zones and the new zones. They are way, way better the first time; but lack the replayablility created by the chaos of the old system. The stories are much better and there are some really epic questlines, but when you do it a second time you can't really change it up or move it around, you do the exact same thing. And again. And again... I'm not sure what the answer is. I'd hate to lose the storytelling and epic feel created by the more scripted approach, but I'm really not looking forward to leveling 3 more alts through it either.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think that is the point. One example is some tanks are using the Belt of the Ferocious Wolf as their tank belt because it edges out over the blacksmithing BoE tank belt. By giving the BoE tank belt a socket it puts it back ahead of the Belt of the Ferocious Wolf (which is arguably a DPS belt ... but works well for both DPS and tanking).<br />
<br />
Some of the BoEs need a little love, and the changes in 4.0.6 are welcome.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, WG now uses the same 1:1 ratio as Tol Barad, which means you need a prayer to get in to the battle. Even moreso for WG since so few people actually run that BG now.<br />

I know people had issues with Tenacity, but at least WG switched hands somewhat frequently on most realms.</div></div><hr />

Wow, I didn't see the guy say he thought they were hard. You must be really good if you instantly knew that. <br />

As for me, I like things the way they are. With ToR taking aim at blizz, RIFT about to be released, it's going to be really interesting to see their reaction.

<br />
This is probably closest to my feeling on the matter. With a guild group, heroics feel good. Challenging, but certainly doable. Perhaps the solution needs to relate the the Luck of the Draw buff. Perhaps take the total number of groups being put together for the run, subtract 1, then multiply by 5% to get your Luck of the Draw buff. So a run that was composed of a 4-man group and 1 other pug would get 5% [ (2-1)*5% = 5% ]. Runs composed of two 2-man groups and one individual pug would get a 10% buff [ (3-1)*5% = 10% ]. A run composed of 5 individual puggers would get a 20% bonus [ (5-1)*5% = 20% ]. Then, the more your group is composed of pugs, the more health, healing, and damage you'll have to compensate. Coding might be tricky when members start coming and going in the pug group but it probably isn't an insurmountable problem.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That would only encourage people to go the opposite way. Right now it's heavily encouraged for a player to only run Guild groups. Blizz has really shot themselves in the foot with the problem of heroics, and even a few instances. With guild groups some fights can just be trivial, with pug groups some fights can be very frustrating. I don't envy them at all. They shouldn't nerf though, they made a choice now they should stick with it. They made the choice of making instances tougher, they knew the consequences. This is bringing a much better feel to community groups that run stuff. It's making guilds do stuff together. The downside is that it punishes you for not being social. Yes it even punishes you some for being in a guild. They should just come out and say &quot;Hey this is the direction WoW is headed in, if you don't like it then leave&quot;. This middle of the road nonsense though is only going to frustrate people on both sides.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you have problems with queue you are obviously a DPS (40min+), as healer you get 3-6min and as a tank you get like 0.2s queue. <br />
<br />
Do you play anything other than rogue/mage/lock/hunter? Great, solved for ya... You will have to collect offspec gear if you didnt already but its really easy and you will finally experience something else than retard-role (aka DPS).<br />
<br />
Are you a pure DPS class (rogue/mage/lock/hunter)? Oh well your guild must have tanks in it. Or other DPSers with an offspec so ask them to go with you. If they are selfish simply offer to them that you will run this one, then the tank can take his DPS alt and you will take your tank alt.<br />
<br />
You dont have any tank/healer alts either? Well then I am sorry, you suck, you are afraid of a responsibility and you are a mindless drone getting boosted through the game. Enjoy 40min+ queue.<br />
<br />
You are an idiot. DPS is not a retard role. Every role has its job to do. And there are bad healers and tanks just like their are bad dps. You probably are not even as good as you think you are. Healing is not that much harder than dpsing sorry (I have healers). And dps has responsibility. Interrupts, taking the least amount of damage, cc, while downing the mobs so you can clear content. Get a clue and grow up.<br />

Compared to tanking or healing it is. You mess up, you lose 1k dps. Tank/heal messes up and its a wipe.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Check each boss at the end of the run. If the tank was there for every boss they get an additional 20g per boss (if they can find a way of scaling it based on the number of tanks entering random queue then bonus). <br />
That will likely increase the number of tanks wanting to queue at random as well as encouraging more people to roll tanks. Scale the amount back if it gets too popular. Considering the tanks are getting constant gear damage from being hit by stuff it will off-set that somewhat.<br />
<br />
With the &quot;whole dungeon&quot; check it will stop a few rage quits from tanks (who get instantly re-filled group anyway if others rage quit) and only &quot;good&quot; tanks (or at least ones the group can carry) will make it to the end. <br />
<br />
I haven't bothered levelling my tank yet, I don't think i'd bother with randoms as I have a good guild anyway but for a good chunk of the rest of the population this (with some tweaking) would likely fix it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wrong.<br />
<br />
If DPS messes up, they miss an interrupt, possible wipe. They don't switch targets fast enough, possible wipe. They don't do a good job avoiding avoidable damage, possible wipe. They don't do enough DPS, possible wipe. They don't keep track of their CC, possible wipe.<br />
<br />
In Wrath, DPS was mindless and didn't take much skill. In Cata, people STILL think it's that way, and they wonder why healers are struggling and their groups fail. DPS has just as much responsibility in Cata as healers and tanks do, and when DPS messes up the consequences are just as bad. They're just often not IMMEDIATE, so what looks like &quot;OMG healer you suck because you went OOM at 50% or I died&quot; was really DPS not living up to their responsibilities.</div></div><hr />

That was bloody lame and i think the whole bad part of the LFD system is to makes you even easier to run into asses and bads.<br />
<br />
I'm having this idea these days, on how to &quot;fix&quot; this LFD system:<br />
<br />
is to implement some sort of demerit point system for these asses and bads, just like how they do for car drivers:<br />
what makes you frustrated in terms of driving? is that you cannot drive.<br />
so what makes you be good on the road? a demerit point system that stops you driving if you behave bad. so if you behave bad, your point got deducted. what if you lose all points? you get suspended. how do you get points back? it decays or resets every x years.<br />
<br />
similar system can be implemented to LFD:<br />
what makes you be frustrated in LFD? long queues.<br />
so make something like minimum queue time. whenever you got vote kicked while you're not dc, it adds 10 minutes to your minimum queue time, it accumulates and has a weekly decay of say 5 minutes. that makes bads and asses get substantially longer and longer queue. but if you behave well again then eventually you'll get normal queue time.<br />
<br />
<br />
interesting? lol</div></div><hr />

I have to say that the worst groups I've gotten into as a tank via LFD were &quot;guild runs&quot;.<br />
Don't ask me why but if the healer and at least 2 dps are from one guild, the group almost always has trouble.<br />
I'm guessing that there's a reason that they couldn't get a guild tank to come with them.......</div></div><hr />

We aren't that lucky, and Blizzard isn't that nice. What will probably happen is the sites will still show up, you just can't collect fragments from them to make them go away until you solve something. Otherwise it would become WAY too convenient to farm a particular race's artifacts. I haven't bothered with this PTR though so I can't be sure. That just seems to me the way that Blizzard would work it.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kearly</div><div class="date">2011-02-08, 11:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are two suggestions I have for improving queue times:<br />
<br />
#1: Nerf heroic difficulty. Yeah, if you have a brain, some experience, and decent gear, they aren't so bad, but sadly only a minority of average Wow players using the dungeon-finder possess all 3 of these attributes. I never really understood why Blizzard decided to make hardcore (raid) content easier but casual (heroic) content harder. Higher difficulty in heroics has resulted in more tanks dying while doing their jobs perfectly well and more healers being left exasperated. Tanking/Healing can be a headache in itself, and this compounded with heroic runs that typically take 1-2 hours and see several people leave is often too much for people to handle. Queues for dps are long because tanking/healing hasn't been this big of a pain since the days when people first hit 60.<br />
<br />
#2: Create further incentive for queuing as a tank or healer (faster queues obviously isn't enough). Double or even triple the random heroic bonus (both points and gold) if someone queues as a tank or healer. Perhaps you could add a special currency that only a tank or only a healer receives, and that could be used to get nifty special items that people would actually want. Right now there are a ton of classes that could queue as tank/heals but choose dps instead because its less work and less stress for the same reward.</div></div><hr />
