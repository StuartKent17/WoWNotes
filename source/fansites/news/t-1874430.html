Blizzcon - Engineering Panel<br />
While we don't have the Blizzcon schedule just yet, we now know there will be an engineering panel this year! We rarely hear official things about engineering outside of the very rare Engineer's Workshop blog post (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/4709-Patch-6-1-Engineer%E2%80%99s-Workshop-Anti-Aliasing-Lighting), so this should be a nice opportunity for players interested in the technical aspects of the game to get some more information! <br />

Patch 6.2.2 Hotfixes - The Frozen Halls<br />
It seems that most of the loot from Pit of Saron and some of The Frozen Halls zone drops had their sell price reduced by 90%, along with the removal of sockets (but not the socket bonus) from some items like Polished Mirror Helm (http://www.wowdb.com/items/49804-polished-mirror-helm).<br />

Ghostcrawler Tweets<br />
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br />
the problem as I see it, blizzard made design choices based on how they think we SHOULD play vs how we WANT to play.<br />
It's tough. The two at the end of the day aren't all that different. But it's not as is if all players speak with one voice. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/648658697896374272))<br />
And at times players think they're perfectly happy with what they have but get excited about something they didn't expect. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/648658915954049024))<br />
<br />
Blaming your customers for your bad product is a terrible, terrible way to do business.<br />
I think the point is more that communicating with players (esp. angry ones) isn't really the product. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/648937638825607168))<br />
Engaging with players can be important and valuable but at the end of the day that isn't the game. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/648937779477352448))<br />
And yet the developer narrative holds the players at fault for the performance of the actual product.<br />
Product failures are always the fault of the product team. I don't hear any blaming the customer here. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/648954332914712576))<br />

Which takes maybe an hour of coding to change some numbers around. Its not as if they've redesigned the instances, its a very minor fix for some kind of issue (probably related to gold farming).<br />

I was worried about that for a second as well, but I doubt it will be as severe as this nerf, if it does ever come. You can only run raids once a week, whereas you can run 5-mans almost infinitely. For a botter, a raid would be a much less ideal way to farm gold.</div></div><hr />

Though i usually did not kill bosses which drop most of this gear but some were random drops in the dungeons. Those instances were nice income if you were making a herald toon or helping someone make one because anything that could not be used would be vendored and made it worth your time.

Those Raids have a weekly Lockout. Farming nhc/trash + resetting 10 times an hour is something completely different, especially if you have a spec that can just instagib the entire instance after collecting enough mobs.</div></div><hr />

I'm still leery. Remember when Blizzard &quot;normalized&quot; gold? Because they were concerned about economy stability?<br />

And then they give us gold from garrisons in WoD so people can actually afford to buy the new WoW Token...</div></div><hr />

They would have done that a long time ago if they were going to. The problem here is automated bots running trash runs / resetting instances for unlimited farming. Meanwhile a legacy raid has a lockout limiting the amount of gold that can be picked up in these instances.</div></div><hr />

If this was something used by players using bots then banning them could be a way to deal with it, but when you see a ton of lvl90 druids with random unpronounceable names in the same spot 24/7 then there is something else going on, most probably related with gold sellers, a ban won't fix the problem since they'll simply get a new account and keep doing the same stuff unless you drastically reduce the profit of that spot... and guess what, that's exactly what they did.</div></div><hr />

for this to actually have an effect on the general population the general population has to purchase from gold sellers<br />

<br />
Botting for gold is done on a large scale by professionals or businesses who operate dozens to hundreds of accounts simultaneously, and banning is simply an operating cost that they factor into their business model. I don't know the actual figures from the countries where this is done, but the idea is that if it costs $5 to set up an account, and you can fence $20 worth of virtual gold using automated scripts before it's banned, that's $15 profit. Do that with 20 accounts simultaneously running on two computers and you've got $300. If they have good underground connections, the $5 base cost per account can be further reduced by paying for stolen credit card numbers which will also be canceled within days - not a concern with for a temporary WoW account.<br />
<br />
When I looked into what botters were doing a couple years ago, the standard routine for dungeon botters was to start mass botting on Friday evenings, farm all weekend, and be gone Monday morning. I assume they were taking advantages of Blizzard's work hours, exploiting the reduction in security staff during weekends, and were then banned when Blizzard staff got to work on Monday. Back then, the dungeon of choice was Botanica, with Halls of Lightning as a viable alternative. Dozens to hundreds of paladins would stream in and out of Botanica every minute (you can find old videos of it on YouTube) and every few runs fly to a mailbox to launder their gold. Blizz can change the economics of a particular dungeon/raid, but it's a whack-a-mole problem - botters will just move to the next most profitable location, after a brief period of adjustment to fine-tune and disseminate scripts.<br />
<br />
I assume these businesses use their resources (computers &amp; personnel) for other mostly-automated profit-making enterprises during the rest of the week.<br />
<br />
People without much technical knowledge often offer easy solutions, like &quot;why not ban their IP?&quot;, but professionals use an array of proxy servers to connect from different and ever-changing IP addresses. There are ways to counter the really easy solutions. Blizzard could hire more people to monitor for bots, because it's always easy to spot a couple hundred a day if you know where to look, but I assume the business case for that doesn't work out. Instead they seem to rely more on customer reports, and as a customer, it's a thankless, never-ending task trying to report that so many botters.</div></div><hr />

Then they limited how many instances you could do an hour, as a direct result of exploiters trying to dupe things in Mauradon. These botters slam the server by spawning so many instances, it's not just gold, it's keeping the server load balanced so 90% of it isn't running Pit Of Charon. And, they DO ban accounts, but quite a few of them are stolen accounts, and that takes time to process - first the player has to notify them their account is compromised, it's locked, they run an investigation, when it's clear the account was stolen (IP logs) they allow the recovery script to be run - this all takes time and money from customer support. Be glad they didn't just remove all drops - or make then worth nothing at all. <br />
<br />
Exploiting WoW and it's customers is a multi-billion dollar industry. They nerfed drops from 7 years ago? That's nothing, considering what costs they incur from thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of accounts botting, exploiting, trying to find new exploits, stealing accounts, etc. &quot;Just ban them!&quot; is like holding up a hand to a hurricane and saying &quot;stop right there!&quot;. <br />
<br />
I can't see anyone caring about this, unless they were botting Pits of Charon, to be honest.<br />

I would ask the question why extending primary bag is a technical issue. I would really interested in hearing the answer from Blizz engineers.<br />
<br />
Someone explained what they thought it was, once - the bag is hard coded into so many aspects of the game, changing it would take a massive review of code to alter it. It's not as simple as just making a tweak to the database, in other words. So many things point to the original bag - every time you loot, or get a quest reward, or the game updates the contents, etc. There's a lot hooked into the bag - from what they said - a lot of the game code looks in that bag first, then other bags, so it's not that easy to have a variable sized bag there. Or something like that.</div></div><hr />

I would certainly love to earn gold from current content instead of farming old dungeons and raids but then again current content is a joke and I cba playing the AH, I got better things to do than sit in front of an auctioneer all day and night.

Whilst it's not the end of the world it's a blow regardless, I prefer farming old dungeons and raids for gold as it's much more enjoyable than running those stupid Tanaan dailies for the 10,000th time and with the garrison mission gold nerfs it's made farming old content even more appealing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't play anymore, but i will be frank here. When i did, i had tons of fun doing old raids with all my alts and getting some gold ( It wasn't that much really either! ), and then, they started to nerf all this, which i don't get it. It took time and effort some times (Heck, it was less profiting to even questing in most of the cases ), so when i got the items i wanted in those places, i didn't have any more reasons to run those places i enjoyed again.<br />
<br />
I really enjoyed those runs, so when i stopped doing them, i got really bored, and the &quot;official&quot; gold making places ( Besides AH ), where toooo damn B O O O R I N G to me, so once the fun killed, i started botting, because let's be real, fuck &quot;virtual working for gold&quot;. As i said, i don't play anymore (And not because i'm banned, heh... ), so sorry if im mentioning this, but for me it was the effect of this kind of stuid nerfs (Believe it or not, i had friends farming here for Quel'Derar and they alway said, that the yield they got farming that somewhat made up for the big grind it was. Go guess now).<br />
<br />
When they started to nerf the fun everywhere on this game, they killed a good piece of what wow was. And i was here since the begining for years and years. They should take some effort and guess some other ways to fix this kind of issues before killing the fun.<br />
<br />
-Note : I don't complain exactly because of this exact &quot;fix&quot;, i complain about this kind of &quot;fixes&quot; (For me it was nerfing old raids gold and some other things)</div></div><hr />
