Horde in Control of Arathi Highlands Warfront Zonewarfronts<br />
The Horde have now taken control of Arathi Highlands! With this comes several things:<br />
<br />
<br />
Horde now have access to the Lion's Roar world boss until the Alliance retake control.<br />
Horde have access to the cyclical quests in Arathi Highlands.<br />
<br />
The League Will Lose (https://www.wowdb.com/quests/53154-the-league-will-lose) - Warfronts Equipment Cache (https://www.wowdb.com/items/164577-warfronts-equipment-cache) (item level 340 warfront gear piece)<br />
Executing Exorcisms (https://www.wowdb.com/quests/53190-executing-exorcisms) - 300 Azerite Power<br />
Boulderfist Beatdown (https://www.wowdb.com/quests/53148-boulderfist-beatdown), Sins of the Syndicate (https://www.wowdb.com/quests/53173-sins-of-the-syndicate), Twice-Exiled (https://www.wowdb.com/quests/53193-twice-exiled), and Wiping Out the Witherbark (https://www.wowdb.com/quests/53150-wiping-out-the-witherbark) - 200 War Resources Each.<br />
<br />
Horde should have their Arathi Highlands rare mobs' loot lockouts reset. They don't seem to have reset for Alliance, however.<br />
Alliance can now start contributing resources in the Boralus Harbor to fill the bar to activate the Battle for Stromgarde Scenario.<br />

We can kill them, yes. But we do not get credit or any drops from them this round. Like others have said many times, the Horde gets 2 kills of the rares with full credit, while we only get the 1 during this full cycle.</div></div><hr />

No, the Horde could kill the rares for AP and loot when Alliance &quot;held&quot; the zone. Now they can do it yet again. (Alliance cannot.) The only thing Horde couldn't kill before for a chance at loot was the world boss. They're on round two of the rares, while Alliance has about five days to go until its first shot at the scenario.</div></div><hr />

If there's a mechanism where we take turns, other faction will always be ahead... Once the cycle ends we get the second rare and it's 2:2 again. Then horde gets to 3:2 and later we reach 3:3... in the long run it makes no difference as they're both equal. And in the gearing contest Arathi doesn't play as major role as you make it sound, and most people aren't interested in the slightest in participating in the world first race on mythic raiding. They propably have full 370's from M+ already anyway. If i'm over 350 as smelly casual i expect better from them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm just reporting what happened, but you are slightly incorrect. The cycle ends when we take back the highlands and it goes full-circle once again after our 7-day time inside the scenario expires. So essentially Horde gets 1 shot at rares with us in our turn making it 1:1, now in their cycle they get a turn but we do not making it 2:1. Once we go again to kill rares the cycle will have reset and they will be a kill ahead of us since you are only counting 1:1 cycles in terms of fairness. So at the end of the next cycle it'll be 3:2 and so on, leaving them a cycle ahead of us which still sucks no matter how you want to spin it (considering one side is able to experience this time-gated content more than another). It really sucks for mount/pet/toy hunters and people still looking for weapon drops or alt gear, so take it for what you will. The entire thing is still a shitshow of poorly tested 'features' and ideas that could have used more time to be ironed out, but that is another discussion for another time.</div></div><hr />

There is no bias to either side, that's just your brain imagining an explanation to the cluster fuck that this expansion has been. There has been poor decisions made by blizzard, game breaking bugs to either side. Fact of the matter is the game should have been released with 2 warfronts with horde and ally controlling each one.</div></div><hr />

I see it less as a deliberate bias, though, and more of just an oversight with &quot;bad optics.&quot; Some completely different slip-up could have easily seen the Alliance benefiting instead of the Horde.

Sure, they could lessen the duration for sure. The current one is absurd, but it might be done to prevent farming 370s so quickly again (though I wouldn't mind putting a cap of one 370 per month on that or a one-time 370 quest).</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you're talking about the world boss, they could still keep that on a weekly lockout. Maybe give the guaranteed(?) 370 from the scenario a weekly lockout as well, that way the best you can do is farm 340s, and both factions get an equal shot throughout the week.<br />
<br />
E: I actually just had a bit of a realisation about this. Warfronts are essentially just faction-specific Legion invasions with some fancy AI and superfluous objectives. On a 3-week rotation, instead of... what, 18 hours? 12?</div></div><hr />

Stop role-playing the game in your head and grow up.</div></div><hr />
