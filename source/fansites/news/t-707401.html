http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/24x24/shaman.jpg Cataclysm Class Preview: Shaman (Shaman Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/class-shaman/))<br />
In World of Warcraft: Cataclysm, we'll be making lots of changes and additions to class talents and abilities across the board. In this preview, you'll get an early look at some of the changes in store for the shaman class, including a rundown of some of the new spells, abilities, and talents, and an overview of how the new Mastery system will work with the different talent specs.<br />
<br />
New Shaman Spells<br />
<br />
Primal Strike (available at level 3): Primal Strike is a new weapon-based attack that every shaman will learn very early in the game. Our goal with this ability is to make leveling as Enhancement rather than as Elemental more viable, since many key Enhancement talents become available at fairly high levels.<br />
<br />
Healing Wave (level 4): While the shaman already has an ability called Healing Wave, we're adding another spell to the class's direct-healing arsenal and giving it a familiar name. The current Healing Wave will be renamed Greater Healing Wave, and the intent is for the 'new&quot; Healing Wave to be the shaman's go-to heal. Lesser Healing Wave and Greater Healing Wave will be used on a more situational basis.<br />
<br />
Unleash Weapon (level 81): Unleashes the power of your weapon enchants for additional effects (see below). A dual-wielding Enhancement shaman will activate the effects of both of their weapon enchants. Instant cast. 30-yard range. 15-second cooldown. Undispellable.<br />
<br />
Here are a few examples of effects we're considering for this ability:<br />
<br />
Windfury Weapon – Hurls a spectral version of your weapon at a target, dealing 50% weapon damage and increasing the shaman's Haste for the next five swings.<br />
Flametongue Weapon – Deals instant Fire damage and buffs the shaman's next Fire attack by 20%.<br />
Earthliving Weapon – Heals the target slightly and buffs the shaman's next healing spell by 20%.<br />
<br />
Healing Rain (level 83): An area-effect heal-over-time (HoT) spell that calls down rain in a selected area, healing all players within it. There is no limit to the number of players who can potentially be affected; however, there are diminishing returns when healing a large number of targets, much like the diminishing returns associated with AoE damage spells. This should give Restoration shaman another healing tool that improves their group-healing and heal-over-time capabilities. 2-second cast time. 30-yard range. 10-second duration. 10-second cooldown.<br />
<br />
Spiritwalker's Grace (level 85): When this self-targeted buff is active, your spells are no longer interrupted by movement and possibly even by your own attacks. This will give shaman of all three specs another way to heal or do damage when it’s necessary to move in both PvE and PvP. Instant cast. 10-second duration. 2-minute cooldown.<br />
<br />
Changes to Abilities and Mechanics<br />
<br />
In addition to adding new spells, we're planning to make changes to some of the other abilities and mechanics you're familiar with. This list and the summary of talent changes below it are by no means comprehensive, but they should give you a good sense of what we intend for each spec.<br />
<br />
Restoration shaman and other healing classes will need to pay attention to mana more than they've had to during Wrath of the Lich King. Spirit will be the Restoration shaman's primary mana-regeneration stat.<br />
<br />
We're making changes to which classes and specs are able to dispel magic, diseases, curses, and poison, largely for PvP purposes. Shaman will have Cleanse Spirit as a baseline ability, but it will only remove curses. Restoration shaman will have a talent that will improve Cleanse Spirit so that it also removes magic. Shaman will no longer be able to remove poison.<br />
<br />
Cleansing Totem will be removed from the game, as we want dispels to be a decision for players, not something done mindlessly. To that end, all dispels will cost slightly more mana, and you will waste the spell if you cast it when there is nothing to remove. (Currently, the dispel is only cast when there is something to remove, which encourages spamming 'just in case.&quot;) We will balance PvE dispelling with this new model in mind.<br />
<br />
Totem of Wrath now will replace Flametongue Totem for all shaman, and dropping this totem will buff the group's spell power by 4%. Elemental shaman will have a talent that lets all Fire totems provide +10% spell power, allowing them to drop Searing, Magma, or Fire Elemental Totems without losing their spell-damage buff. The 4% and 10% buffs will be exclusive with each other and with the warlock's Demonic Pact, so you can't benefit from all of them at once. We're also considering letting Elemental drop Searing Totem at range.<br />
<br />
We want to free up Enhancement global cooldowns to make the spec more dynamic to play. We're considering, for example, increasing the cooldown of Lava Lash so shaman have time to work other interesting abilities into their rotation.<br />
<br />
<br />
New Talents and Talent Changes<br />
<br />
Elemental Reach will be simplified so shaman have a more consistent spell range.<br />
<br />
We plan to add Earthquake as a deep Elemental talent for targeted and persistent AoE.<br />
<br />
Spirit Link will likely be worked back into deep Restoration in some form. The idea is that you will be able to link targets together so they share damage. When we had previously tried to implement Spirit Link, it was hard to balance and a little confusing. However, we really liked the concept -- and so did players -- so we are trying to bring it back.<br />
<br />
Elemental will have a deep talent that allows Spirit (which will appear on the gear they share with Restoration shaman) to boost their Hit rating.<br />
<br />
Ancestral Knowledge will boost mana pool size, not Intellect.<br />
<br />
Enhancing Totems will be replaced with Focused Strikes, which will improve the damage of the new spell Primal Strike and Stormstrike.<br />
<br />
With the Mastery system, we're also considering removing a number of talents that grant passive bonuses, such as Mental Quickness, Improved Windfury Totem, Mental Dexterity, Call of Thunder, Tidal Mastery, Purification, Nature's Blessing, and others, to allow players more freedom to choose more interesting talents.<br />
<br />
<br />
Mastery Passive Talent Tree Bonuses<br />
<br />
Elemental<br />
Spell damage<br />
Spell Crit<br />
Elemental Overload<br />
<br />
Elemental Overload: Your direct-damage spells have a chance to proc a less powerful 'bonus&quot; version of the spell. This will work much like the current Lightning Overload talent, but would also apply to Lava Burst.<br />
<br />
Enhancement<br />
Melee damage<br />
Melee Haste<br />
Nature Damage<br />
<br />
Nature Damage: This will provide a passive bonus to the Nature damage dealt by the Enhancement shaman.<br />
<br />
Restoration<br />
Healing<br />
Meditation<br />
Deep Healing<br />
<br />
Deep Healing: Your direct heals will do more healing when the target's health is lower. This will scale to damage (e.g. someone at 29% health would receive more healing than someone at 30%) rather than have arbitrary break points.<br />
<br />
We hope you enjoyed this preview, and we're looking forward to hearing your thoughts and feedback on these additions and changes. Please keep in mind that this information represents a work in progress and is subject to change as development on Cataclysm continues.<br />
<br />
Update<br />
Just to clarify a few things:<br />
<br />
Meditation – the amount of mana you regenerate in combat as a function of your Spirit.<br />
<br />
Also of note, you only get one set of passive talent tree bonuses: the tree in which you’ve spent the most points. Sub-speccing in another tree will not net you those bonuses in addition.<br />
<br />
Last but not least, it's the intention of Primal Strike to let shaman play as an Enhancement at low levels. Currently when leveling in this spec, you end up just using Lightning Bolt a lot so you feel like an Elemental shaman instead. At a higher level, Primal Strike gets replaced by Storm Strike. They share a cooldown so Enhancement just won’t ever use Primal Strike after that, in the same way that Prot warriors don’t use Sunder Armor once they have Devastate or Feral druids don’t use Claw once they get Mangle.</div></div><hr />

The idea is to make you situationally decide how large of a heal to use, because mana will evidently be not so easily regenerated in Cataclysm.</div></div><hr />

I think the idea is that they want to give shamans an efficient middle-of-the-road heal, in addition to an inefficient fast small heal and an inefficient slow giant heal. They want healers to have to make more choices about what heal to use in any given situation.</div></div><hr />

Flametongue Weapon – Deals instant Fire damage and buffs the shaman's next Fire attack by 20%<br />
i thought ... oh joy even bigger lava burst damage<br />
then i read <br />
Elemental Overload: Your direct-damage spells have a chance to proc a less powerful 'bonus&quot; version of the spell. This will work much like the current Lightning Overload talent, but would also apply to Lava Burst<br />
then it was a facepalm... i guess shammy's will be able to one shot every thing with PVP gear on too then<br />

Crying too soon.<br />

Who says they won't be lowering the co-efficient of Lava Burst?<br />

<br />
Healing Rain (level 83): An area-effect heal-over-time (HoT) spell that calls down rain in a selected area, healing all players within it. There is no limit to the number of players who can potentially be affected; however, there are diminishing returns when healing a large number of targets, much like the diminishing returns associated with AoE damage spells. This should give Restoration shaman another healing tool that improves their group-healing and heal-over-time capabilities. 2-second cast time. 30-yard range. 10-second duration. 10-second cooldown.<br />

<br />
&quot; When this self-targeted buff is active, your spells are no longer interrupted by movement and possibly even by your own attacks.&quot;<br />
<br />
It would be kinda awesome if you could Buff yourself with Spiritwalker's Grace, do a Healing Rain at the melee, and at the same time heal the range with Chain heal or another spell. eg the new Healing Wave. If your attacks won't be interrupted by your own attacks as the say it might.<br />
<br />
And Spirit Link getting back, It's kinda awesome to but on the MT and OT, instead of having the MT only getting spanked and in need of alot of healing.<br />
<br />
And &quot;Deep healing&quot; mastery is not as bad either ^^</div></div><hr />

To that end, all dispels will cost slightly more mana, and you will waste the spell if you cast it when there is nothing to remove. (Currently, the dispel is only cast when there is something to remove, which encourages spamming 'just in case.&quot;) We will balance PvE dispelling with this new model in mind.<br />

If the changes for the other classes are at least 80 % of what i see for dear old shamies , i will love this game even more<br />
Removing passive talents and making em mastery (some of them ) so that the player can choose more interesting things is verry veeeerrrry interesting <br />

Spiritwalker's Grace (level 85): When this self-targeted buff is active, your spells are no longer interrupted by movement and possibly even by your own attacks.

That can bring an entire new dimension to shamans. Ele's/resto's can actually move when needed in pvp and pve, and enh doesnt have to wait for full maelstrom stack. Just maybe that its the wrong class considering bl.. can get really scary in pvp to have a haste focus, hitting BL and then spamming CL or LB every sec for 10s along with elemental overload procs.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also love the haste focus. Haste from the unleash weapon WF proc, haste from the tree, flurry, haste on gear, bl/heroism... Add in the occasional WF proc/static shock proc/skills and the shaman will easily feel dynamic with all the numbers flying arround even if there isnt much changing.<br />
Seems like the focus is slowly changing from vanilla's occasional hitting like a truck (wf proc = dead) to a more rogue-ish sustained output. Elemental overload kinda does the same by allowing all spells to trigger a 2nd cast, the potential searing totem at range and ofc Earthquake *ponders if elemental overload can proc earthquake...*.<br />
<br />
<br />
With these dynamic-like changes that focus on watching lots of small numbers (and thats really fun from my prot pala's experience) it really shows they're stearing everything towards more sustained output rather then big crits and making you feel you're really busy with a lot of things. Kinda makes me wonder what they'll do with the rest....</div></div><hr />

Did you picture it with rain that looks like what comes out of the lightwells in ToC like I did? If not, I'd say rain fits pretty well. Their main element is nature, and water is either frost or nature, depending on how you look at it (and they have two frost spells, too).</div></div><hr />

<br />
These are going to be some great changes; I can only hope rogues get half this much love.<br />
<br />
As to Moving while casting, probably still going to see a cast bar, but that bar won't stop suddenly when you move; at least that's how it sounds to me. So you can run in a big circle on Rotface (for example) while still casting lightning bolt or lavaburst.</div></div><hr />

Let's try to see the big picture.<br />
<br />
Blizzard has said they're going to revamp healing, aka you're not going to have a paladin spamming holy light on both tanks for an entire fight. You'll have to actually time your heals or you're oom. So we're going back to vanilla type healing, where you let the tank drop a little and then heal him. <br />
Now you say all other ways they have tried to implement this has failed? Well they haven't tried this before.<br />
Previous talents worked at an arbitrary number, like 35% hp. This one will give a benefit at 99% hp, 75% hp, 50%hp or 1% hp. No matter when you heal, you'll get a bonus (or it's overhealing anyway).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Given the plans for healing in Cataclysm, yes it really is necessary. Every class will have the following spells as baseline :<br />
1)Small, Fast, Inefficient heal for when you need a heal NOW<br />
2)Medium sized, medium speed, efficient heal for baseline work.<br />
3)BIG, SLOW, inefficient heal for when the damage is to big for the Medium to keep up.<br />

You aren't suppose to let them get low but if they do its easier to get them up if you have a healing bonus when they do get low,and if you have to be more mana efficient,like they said they would have to be,letting them get low might be your only option without going oom.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Resto shamans NEED to be in a raid in order to succeed, because casting spirit link on the MT and OT is the only option. MT without spirit link will either die or get too much spike damage (which decreases mana-efficient healing by alot).<br />
<br />
But then again, MT damage might be alot more spreadout and predictive, or spirit link will only soak up 10% of the damage or smt to the OT. This is all speculation, and there's isn't any data available for the other class' changes :D<br />
<br />
What I ment with this post is that I can imagine it being nerfed, or made 'not so special' by giving it to other healers too in one way or another. But that however we might put it, it won't be 'that' powerful, because then the situation described above might occure.<br />
<br />
Oh well, &lt;3 the changes :D (looks like it's time for skilled people to shine imo!)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Some of the changes like spiritwalker and spirit link sound awesome. Hopefully one or both do not get replaced by another riptide. <br />
<br />
Other changes just seem like they are gonna make it too tedious. I am not a fan of targeted healing (healing rain). This spell also doesn't help us where we was weak (raid healing a spread out group. Sounds like they are making us king of melee raid healing, indeed, but we are already pretty much that. I would rather have a binding heal like spell tbh.<br />
<br />
Unleash weapon sounds clunky. Hopefully it will not trigger the gcd.<br />
<br />
Deep healing sounds pretty meh. I don't think it will be a substantial amount of actual healing but the healing it will do will be very valuable. <br />
<br />
Removal of cleansing totem and ability to remove poisons hurts, esp in pvp. Hopefully they will balance it where it doesn't hurt too bad. <br />
<br />
The healing wave change makes me wonder the reason. I'm guessing lesser healing wave will never be used at max level and the new healing wave will replace it.<br />
<br />
I am a pessimist, I admit, but not overly excited personally like many of you seem to be.</div></div><hr />

In World of Warcraft: Cataclysm, we'll be making lots of changes and additions to class talents and abilities across the board. In this preview, you'll get an early look at some of the changes in store for the shaman class, including a rundown of some of the new spells, abilities, and talents, and an overview of how the new Mastery system will work with the different talent specs.<br />
<br />
New Shaman Spells<br />
<br />
Primal Strike (available at level 3): Primal Strike is a new weapon-based attack that every shaman will learn very early in the game. Our goal with this ability is to make leveling as Enhancement rather than as Elemental more viable, since many key (a)Enhancement talents become available at fairly high levels.<br />
<br />
Unleash Weapon (level 81): Unleashes the power of your weapon enchants for additional(b) effects (see below). A dual-wielding Enhancement shaman will activate the effects of both of their weapon enchants. Instant cast. 30-yard range. 15-second cooldown. Undispellable.<br />
<br />
Here are a few examples of effects we're considering for this ability:<br />
<br />
Windfury Weapon – Hurls a spectral version of your weapon at a target, dealing 50% weapon damage and increasing the shaman's Haste for the next five swings.<br />
Flametongue Weapon – Deals instant Fire damage and buffs the shaman's next Fire attack by 20%.<br />
Earthliving Weapon – Heals the target slightly and buffs the shaman's next healing spell by 20%.<br />
<br />
Spiritwalker's Grace (level 85): When this self-targeted buff is active, your spells are no longer interrupted by movement and possibly even (c)by your own attacks. This will give shaman of all three specs another way to heal or do damage when it’s necessary to move in both PvE and PvP. Instant cast. 10-second duration. 2-minute cooldown.<br />
<br />
Totem of Wrath now will replace Flametongue Totem for all shaman, and dropping this totem will buff the group's spell power by 4%(d). Elemental shaman will have a talent that lets all Fire totems provide +10% spell power, allowing them to drop Searing, Magma, or Fire Elemental Totems without losing their spell-damage buff. The 4% and 10% buffs will be exclusive with each other and with the warlock's Demonic Pact, so you can't benefit from all of them at once. We're also considering letting Elemental drop Searing Totem at range.<br />
<br />
We want to free up Enhancement global cooldowns to make the spec more dynamic to play. We're considering, for example, increasing the cooldown of Lava Lash (e)so shaman have time to work other interesting abilities into their rotation.<br />
<br />
<br />
New Talents and Talent Changes<br />
<br />
Ancestral Knowledge will boost mana pool size, not Intellect.(f)<br />
<br />
Enhancing Totems (g)will be replaced with Focused Strikes, which will improve the damage of the new spell Primal Strike and Stormstrike.<br />
<br />
With the Mastery system, we're also considering removing a number of talents that grant passive bonuses, such as Mental Quickness, Improved Windfury Totem, Mental Dexterity(h), Call of Thunder, Tidal Mastery, Purification, Nature's Blessing, and others, to allow players more freedom to choose more interesting talents.<br />
<br />
<br />
Mastery Passive Talent Tree Bonuses<br />
<br />
Enhancement<br />
Melee damage<br />
Melee Haste<br />
Nature Damage<br />
<br />
Nature Damage: This will provide a passive bonus to the Nature damage dealt by the Enhancement shaman.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Really? Why all the praise? especially for enhance this is just horrible. seriously, I bolded stuff in the qote above:<br />
<br />
a) This ability will be for leveling purposes only, most likely replaced by stormstrike by level 80 since there is no room in the GCDs.<br />
<br />
b) ADDITIONAL effect, yes this is cool, but it is another cool down- no it does not proc windfury for you.<br />
<br />
c) Possibly means wont, but what does that matter the only spells any enhance casts are instant anyway thanks to maelstrom weapon- great for ele and resto though.<br />
<br />
d) Who cares what they really do- They strip enhance of almost all of it's spell power, moving these to %based means we will get virtually nothing out of them, screw y'all i am using magma.<br />
<br />
e) No, its just the class is already so cool down choked they have to nerf an ability to give you room to use any new ones.<br />
<br />
f) Int is not AP anymore, but that means this is no longer a DPS talent and will be avoided anyway.<br />
<br />
g) No that's fine I don't mind losing Agi and Str (AP AP) from my str of earth totem, nono saves me a little mana just use your horn of winter. Only enhances 2 abilities instead of all of them. One of which probably wont even be used. so unless 5 points increases stormstike's damage by 50% it will be a nerf over all.<br />
<br />
h) the Good byes:<br />
Mental Quickness - instant spells don't get mana cost reduced by 6%, 30% of AP to Spellpower- oh crap this is why (d) sucks. your only going to see like 10 spellpower out of flametonge now. enjoy shitty useless fire spells (assuming the mastery nature damage makes up for this for earthshock and LBs... which it wont)<br />
<br />
Improved Windfury Totem - No no use your frost DK talent, it is better than the ability it ripped off... (seriously? you give us 5% more melee haste on flurry and take 4% away from totems? Everyone called it this is what that change was for)<br />
<br />
Mental Dexterity - No more AP from INT. (But then since hunters wont use mana anyway, hopefully Int will be off all out gear anyway, joy i love running out of mana)<br />
<br />
Others - Yeah means don't be surprised as they continue to run this spec into the ground.<br />
<br />
And for this we gain... Melee damage, Melee Haste, Nature damage... 3rd part which i doubt will make up for all the spellpower loss.<br />
<br />
Really?? Because i was hoping to see expertise in there so we didn't have to fill every freaking gem slot with it because hunters don't need it so you don't even give it to us on our own tier set!<br />
<br />
Better yet, make hunters need expertise- People dodge and parry bullets in fantasy movies all the time, make it happen in WoW!<br />

<br />
<br />
10 minute cooldown versus 10 second cooldown.<br />
One based around the caster, one targeted.<br />
And isn't tranquility limited to just the group? This is clearly a raid heal.<br />
<br />
I'm pretty sure healing rain will be pretty nice, but not an answer for every aoe situation. Isn't that what people are always whining about niche healing and class diversity, you're getting it so please say thank you and shut up :D.<br />
<br />
And this aren't all the changes coming to cata, there will be a lot more and they'll more than likely be revealed when the beta gets released. I bet there are quite a few totem changes coming.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Look like a lot of decent additions for Shamans though, now to wait for the other two classes today :D<br />
<br />
<br />
Main thing it's useful for is not having to waste a trinket proc / cooldown / speed pot because the boss decides to frost bomb the guy next to you's ass. Just keep casting while running out of the AoE.<br />
<br />
Also PvP. ;D</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't play a healing Shaman, but the healing ones in particular might make me want to!<br />
<br />
My main is a Paladin, and seeing this, I can't wait to see what they might do for us. I'm desperately hoping for a heal-while-moving spell at 85!<br />

<br />
Did you miss the spell under that where you'll most likely be able to cast it while moving? (On a cooldown.)</div></div><hr />

A new Greater Healing spell...dont know about that. Sounds like lesser healing wave is going to be used less then and how long casting time will the Greater Healing spell be on since Healing wave is kinda long if you dont count haste in.<br />
Looking forward to Spirit Link too<br />
<br />
I think its sad that they remove the poising totem and change our cleanse spells but i guess its good that you have to think more than just mindlessly putting poisen totem down, alltho massive poisens in the raid is going to be annoying to remove one by one.<br />
<br />
I also really like that we are getting a spell that makes us cast spells even while moving. Thank you! Now i dont have to going all crazy about druids all the time lol<br />
<br />
I like these changes. In fact i didnt thought it would be like this at all!</div></div><hr />

A healing spell with the same aoe mechanics such as &quot;Rain of Fire&quot; or &quot;Blizzard&quot; would require the raid to completely rethink it's positioning. And basing your raids position around 1 spell is a bit much.<br />

So Blizzard should stop making us believe that they will improove Enhancement. Why keeping this spec if you only improove Elem/resto though these spec are so good today ? Go delete Enhancement instead of trying to kill this spec silently. So shame</div></div><hr />

Why keeping this spec if you only improove Elem/resto though these spec are so good today ? Go delete Enhancement instead of trying to kill this spec silently. So shame<br />
<br />
You gotta realize that this is not even close to all the changes, its just a taste, little pieces on each spec. There will be many more updates, they do not in any way plan on leaving enhancement in the dust, they are just trying to think of ways to make less gaps in the rotation.</div></div><hr />

I agree with previous posters, unleash weapon is just another name for judgement... Seems like enhance getting a raw deal, atleast from the preview. Better hope there is alot of stuff not mentioned here for them otherwise it might become the dead spec it was back in vanilla. <br />

f) Int is not AP anymore, but that means this is no longer a DPS talent and will be avoided anyway.<br />
<br />
Mental Dexterity - No more AP from INT. (But then since hunters wont use mana anyway, hopefully Int will be off all out gear anyway, joy i love running out of mana)<br />
<br />
<br />
You must not keep up with the changes their doing because these things in particular are so off it's not even funny. Int isn't AP because AP won't be in game anymore much like spellpower. DO YOU NOT REALIZE THAT CHANGES TO STUFF LIKE THIS MEAN THEY HAVE PLANS ELSEWHERE AND THEY AREN'T TELLING US EVERY LAST DETAIL OF WHAT THEY ARE DOING?

If any class needs &quot;Fanbois&quot; I think Shaman need a boost in their populous. Futhermore it's a damn preview no point in ranting on how terrible enhancement is when you don't know all the changes are coming.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Or on ranged when they can be clumped together to maximize the effect.<br />
<br />
<br />
Well obviously you would get more benefit from the spell if every ranged stood in its aoe, so it would be stupid to not have all your ranged stand on top of each other whenever possible.<br />
But if it's actually going to be as good as it sounds it would mean that shamans would either spend the entire raid channeling it or they would never use it at all.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't be surprised if this turned out to be a fake change made up by Blizzard in order to get shamans to buy the xpac. Or even completely fail like &quot;Heroic Leap&quot; did for warriors at the start of WOTLK<br />
<br />
The rest of the changes seem like a good idea though</div></div><hr />

But I'm sort of optimistic, it seems like the forum wish list for elemental. Won't comment too much on the other two specs.<br />
<br />
Spiritwalker grace is nice, but at 10s/2m it is far, far from OP. It will be handy for raids when all healers have to move out of the fire, but it won't turn resto pvp shamans into dr00ds. Mages, I wouldn't hold my breath waiting for it, because frankly it's still inferior to blink. For elemental, I wonder if you can use it running away? Will you have to face your target? Only at the end?<br />
<br />
Anyway. Not OP. It's keeping the tank alive during transitions. It's ~5 casts every 2 mins at very best. The cooldown/duration makes it kinda neat, a decent boost and a way to separate the good shamans from the scrubs, but that's about it.<br />
<br />
Glad to see spirit link coming back. Hope they get the kinks worked out this time.<br />
<br />
Healing rain is sort of silly. It's basically chain heal x 2 or whatever. Unless its radius winds up being huge.<br />
<br />
Earthquake: To quote the jarhead from that other Blizzard game: &quot;Hell, it's about time.&quot;<br />
<br />
I am not a super big fan of unleash weapon for the same reasons I despise lava burst: fixed cooldown abilities scale horribly (read: not at all). And every once in a while someone is going to get hit with an unleash weapon/LvB/LvB overload/EM LB (crit)/LO LB (crit), get insta gibbed in an expansion where that's going to be rare, and cry. A lot. A whole lot. Even though the odds of that are &quot;not even remotely imaginable. It's like one in a fucking million.&quot; Not that I care about pvp QQ. I'm more concerned at the lousy haste scaling of fixed cooldown spells and non existant crit scaling of LvB. Really wish they'd up the coeff and take the autocrit off that sucker, and make haste affect the CD. I digress.</div></div><hr />

Wrong, AP wont be on ITEMS - it will still be in the game. Failure again to comprehend.<br />
Spellpower wont be on MOST items, it will still show up on your weapons.<br />

OBVIOUSLY they have plans elsewhere, I am pointing out how BAD of a light they have left enhance in once AGAIN- Blizzard has never know what to do with the spec, and clearly still don't, which is why every expansion it is like a whole new class. The only reason they don't say how they will make up the gaps is because they don't yet know HOW they will make up the gaps, just as they never have.<br />
<br />
Then returning to the personal attack at the end, love it. If there were something positive to be said it would be said, but they gave nothing (FOR ENHANCE) that warranted positive response.

AP will be on select items, and Spell power from what I read will not be on weapons so that weapons can be made much more interesting regularly like Niblung, why would they need spell power on the weapons if there's like 300+ int on a staff and 3 sockets for example. If the spell power is 1 int = 2 sp (which it will likely be) that is a lot of spell power not to mention whats going to come from talents.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, they've already stated that spell power will show up on weapons for essentially the same reason that Feral AP shows up on weapons. Whether it will be an itemized stat, or a stat that is only visible to casters, it's impossible to say for sure.<br />
<br />
AFAIK Attack Power is going away as a stat on items altogether. Agility and Strength users will be pretty much restricted to their own items without much cross over, if any.</div></div><hr />

Ya. The devil will be in the details, so we can do nothing but wait and see. Depending on radius, amount healed, and raid mechanics it could be anywhere from OP to useless.<br />

primal strike sounds like the spell you will use while leveling, (lesser/greater) healing wave is just another healing spell.. same idea like the priests lesser heal, flash heal &amp; greater heal, unleash weapon is the new judgement for shamans, healing rain bit like tranquility and the spiritwalker thing is a simple presence of mind(mage) for shamans...<br />
so...i hope cataclysm will have more innovative talents/spells not just same spells with different names for every class..</div></div><hr />
