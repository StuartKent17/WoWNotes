<br />
Patch 5.2 Update - You Can Keep Your Valor!<br />
It looks like the patch could be more than two weeks away now, so keep an eye out for the end of PvP season blog post (https://twitter.com/Bashiok/status/301521729644273664).<br />
After reading your feedback and locking ourselves in dim, fluorescent-lit rooms for much deliberation, we have decided that we are NOT going to convert Valor to Justice and Justice to gold when 5.2 ships. Current Valor items will continue to require Valor in 5.2, and will be offered at a discount as listed in the PTR patch notes (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/249740-patch-52-ptr-and-patch-notes-february-5/). Given that PvE and PvP currencies function quite a bit differently, Conquest will still convert to Honor and Honor to gold as previously discussed.<br />
<br />
We’re making the Valor change for a couple of reasons, but primarily because we think a down-conversion under the new Mists endgame progression model just feels mean. We traditionally viewed this conversion process with each patch as a necessary evil to discourage hoarding—it’s not fun to feel like you can’t spend your Valor in the weeks before a new patch because you have to be ready to buy everything up. However, we have a Valor cap now to prevent excessive hoarding, many of the Valor rewards in 5.2 require raiding to acquire (for example, many of the ilevel-522 rewards are tied to Shado-Pan Assault (http://ptr.wowdb.com/factions/1435-shado-pan-assault) reputation, which you’ll only gain rep with by raiding in the Throne of Thunder), and the LFR version has an ilvl-480 requirement, meaning you can’t hoard Valor on a brand new 90 and jump straight to the best stuff. All of these factors being considered, it doesn’t make good sense to take Valor away from players in this context. Down-conversions may occur for future patch releases depending on the circumstances, but for 5.2 it’s safe and snuggly where it is.<br />
<br />
In addition, we’re making a change to ensure that there are some gear rewards available via the Kirin Tor Offensive and Sunreaver Onslaught, the two new factions with which players can earn reputation in 5.2 without raiding. The patch was shaping up to be a real challenge for players who don’t like raiding (including LFR), as our original design meant that no new Valor rewards would be available to them without needing to run Throne of Thunder. You can expect to see the Valor rewards on the Kirin Tor Offensive and Sunreaver Onslaught quartermasters updated on the 5.2 public test realms in the near future. These rewards are ilevel 496 (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/armor?filter-patch=16408&amp;filter-ilvl-min=496&amp;filter-ilvl-max=496) and will only accommodate a few slots, as they aren’t intended to be very attractive to raiders (including those running LFR), but should give non-raiders something to shoot for in 5.2.<br />
<br />
If you’ve already made plans and sank your Valor, don’t fret! As of this announcement, and even if you have 0 Valor currently, you still have enough time to cap out at 3000 Valor before patch 5.2 goes live. (It’s math!)<br />
<br />
We’d love to hear your feedback about this change, and how you’re planning to earn, save, and spend Valor before the patch releases</div></div><hr />

<br />
They've lost 500k since MoP came out, not 3m.<br />
<br />
Also, first people say &quot;listen to us!&quot; and then when Blizzard listens to them they say &quot;oh look, they're just doing whatever they are told!&quot;.<br />
<br />
I'm 100% sure Blizzard thinks through changes and does what THEY think is best. It might not be the best choice there is, so Blizzard takes feedback and improves it. Quit trying to bash Blizzard every option you get, it gets tiresome.<br />
<br />
Also, the change isn't as big as people think. It's not like people will be able to spend their valor for a few weeks on the new gear anyways. Starting with 0 valor now or at the start of the patch doesn't change anything except not getting any valor for a few weeks until you can spend what you have capped.</div></div><hr />

It is a big change. It means that any valor that doesnt fit nicely into costs of gear won't be lost. It means that people can save up and buy current valor gear (mainly DO) at reduced prices, thus more easily boosting their ilvl and power for 5.2 raids. It means that if I have 1500 VP right before the patch comes out, I don't have to buy a 489 item to replace a 483. I can wait and replace a more expensive slot 463 with a 496 or 489.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, but that's about it. No way to get a head start on the new patch, just helps you catch up easier.</div></div><hr />

Upgraded heroic staff with 1488 base agi on it and the ability to add another 660 agi.<br />
(also has more Mastery than the 522 as well as almost identical Expertise to the 522's Hit.)<br />
<br />
The only difference is a slight amount of weapon damage, which may or may not overrule it for Melee.<br />
<br />
<br />
And for casters we have<br />
<br />
http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/94974-suen-wo-spire-of-the-falling-sun<br />

(Staff loses out on 50 mastery and makes up for it with 80 of the other secondary stat)<br />
<br />
So no. The difference isnt massive. I didnt say it was. But when raiding in a hardcore environment, If im doing 150,000 dps and I COULD be doing 150,001 dps, Im gonna go with the 1 dps increase.<br />
<br />
<br />
Uh... no. I know you compulsively feel like you have to post first, and pretend to make insightful comments in a rush. But that is just wrong, and does not even make sense, ilvl is ilvl...<br />

Im also really happy you felt the need to edit this in while I was posting while linking a NECK comparison. Literally one of the absolute worst pieces, in terms of flat out stats, for any single person.</div></div><hr />

That's what you get for jumping the gun so early Holyshnikies. Always wait for final confirmation of patch information before making such a decision. :) That said, definitely a good decision on their part for non-raiders and alts.<br />
<br />
Considering that the last announcement (conversion announcement) was assumed to be the final desicion I don't think Holy was really in the wrong here. You can't live on the assumption that everything said might be gone back on in the days before release.<br />
<br />
I am not blaming blizzard for changing their minds after reciving player feedback it is actually very nice to see but I HATE this mentality that players have to account for every possibility and all fault lies on them.</div></div><hr />

They are removing it. However, the items that are already upgraded stay that way. Im talking of Items (Specifically Weapons and Trinkets (Possibly tier)) that are already upgraded.</div></div><hr />

So when the new patch hits you can buy one new piece of gear from Shado-Pan. I've heard that every boss will give you about 500 rep each and with 12+1 boss (Ra-Den is like Sinestra heroic only?) you'll get 6000 rep the first week so you can buy another item. 2 items in the first week of normal mode quality isn't that of a game changer especially not for hardcore guilds because every hardcore guild will buy 2 pieces in the first week.<br />
<br />
That you can keep your valor is a good change and that they upgrade the new rewards to itemlevel 496 up from 476 is good and needed. Because who would have bought the pieces? They'd cost doubled amount of valor than the old pieces and were itemlevel 476 and the old 5.0 ones are 489. They were worthless because they were more expensive and had worse stats. With itemlevel 496 they are on par with the 5.1 rewards which is good.<br />
<br />
Just hoping that item upgrading will come back quickly because without it, there's not much to spend valor on.</div></div><hr />

They are removing it. However, the items that are already upgraded stay that way. Im talking of Items (Specifically Weapons and Trinkets (Possibly tier)) that are already upgraded.<br />
Ohhh so you mean raiders are better off upgrading their stuff before 5.2, than to get the new 522s. Gotcha.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not entirely as eventually in patch 5.3 those 522's will be upgradeable. So while some 517's might currently be better than the 522's, I would still suggest not passing on any 522 gear.</div></div><hr />

As of this announcement, and even if you have 0 Valor currently, you still have enough time to cap out at 3000 Valor before patch 5.2 goes live. (It’s math!)<br />
<br />
That means we'll have at least 3 weeks before the patch hits.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mstieler</div><div class="date">2013-02-13, 06:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't see how it makes much of a difference. You can't spend that valour until you have lots of rep, so you might as well just spend it on upgrades now.<br />
<br />
Except the fact that the raid faction (Shado-Pan Assault) has ilvl 522 VP rewards available from Neutral:<br />
Necks - Neutral rep, 1250 VP<br />
Wrists - Friendly rep, 1250 VP<br />
Rings - Friendly rep, 1250 VP<br />
Trinkets - Friendly rep, 1750 VP<br />
Hands - Honored rep, 1750 VP<br />
Legs - Honored rep, 2250 VP<br />
Backs - Honored rep, 1750 VP<br />
Chests - Revered rep, 2250 VP<br />
Belts - Revered rep, 1750 VP<br />
Shoulders - Revered rep, 1750 VP<br />
<br />
So, even from the minute 5.2 hits, you could go pick up a new Neck, and shortly after downing some bosses (however much rep they'll give, or even from possibly championing the faction for your first Scenario + Heroic) pick up a set of Wrists, a Ring, or a Trinket.</div></div><hr />

If i were capped and spent my points earlier today before this post, and were now at 0 valor as of the post, it would take 4 raid weeks to get valor capped from now. Even if they aren't counting today (which would be quite an oversight) it still means we have at least 3 weeks.</div></div><hr />

Im just gonna assume that reading isnt your strong suit and copy and paste this from the blue post.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you’ve already made plans and sank your Valor, don’t fret! As of this announcement, and even if you have 0 Valor currently, you still have enough time to cap out at 3000 Valor before patch 5.2 goes live. (It’s math!)&quot;<br />

The timing on this worked out perfectly honestly. People just suck at interpreting the situation and looking at the entire picture.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also, first people say &quot;listen to us!&quot; and then when Blizzard listens to them they say &quot;oh look, they're just doing whatever they are told!&quot;.<br />
<br />
I'm 100% sure Blizzard thinks through changes and does what THEY think is best. It might not be the best choice there is, so Blizzard takes feedback and improves it. Quit trying to bash Blizzard every option you get, it gets tiresome.<br />
<br />
Also, the change isn't as big as people think. It's not like people will be able to spend their valor for a few weeks on the new gear anyways. Starting with 0 valor now or at the start of the patch doesn't change anything except not getting any valor for a few weeks until you can spend what you have capped.<br />
<br />
kiss ass much? Blizzard is great but lets be honest there is also logic and all MoP is is dailies and more dailies and less actual content. I only now logon to do Raid and cap vp, otherwise i'm on GW2. now considering the thoughtful process to Combat rogues it mean i am now cancelling my account.</div></div><hr />

Will you able to spend them on something on the first week? No, because you will need to farm rep from raiding.<br />

I think you should cap with 1,5k valor, the rest you should use on upgrades.</div></div><hr />

Again, the Shado-Pan Assault reputation necklaces only require Neutral reputation, not to mention that current valor items will be reduced by 50% cost, which allows people to more easily buy some slots that they've been unlucky with.<br />

Of course, because SPA is the absolute ONLY rep in MoP that is ever going to require you to get BOTH rep AND Valor to buy anything from them, and there's no other factions that require the double dipping!<br />

What are you talking about? The post you quote is spot on: the SPA VP Neck requires Neutral rep, so you'll be able to buy it immediately. So if you cap to 3k, spend 1.25k when 5.2 lands, you'll have plenty of room for the 1k cap that week.</div></div><hr />

You won't be able to buy anything with that valor right off the bat, since you need rep. I mean...you'll be raiding early in the week, so you're going to get valor for that. In other words, why are top end raiders so worried about capping 3k valor? They're just going to lose the valor they can earn the first week of raiding...or am I wrong here?</div></div><hr />

Upgraded heroic staff with 1488 base agi on it and the ability to add another 660 agi.<br />
(also has more Mastery than the 522 as well as almost identical Expertise to the 522's Hit.)<br />
<br />
The only difference is a slight amount of weapon damage, which may or may not overrule it for Melee.<br />
<br />
<br />
And for casters we have<br />
<br />
http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/94974-suen-wo-spire-of-the-falling-sun<br />
Staff with 1478 passive int and 8925 passive spellpower. and the ability to put an extra 380 int (160+160+60socket)<br />
<br />
http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/87170-jinya-orb-of-the-waterspeaker?upgradeNum=2<br />
Staff with 1488 (+10) int and 8521(-404) passive spellpower with the ability to put an extra 660 (500+160)<br />
(Staff loses out on 50 mastery and makes up for it with 80 of the other secondary stat)<br />
<br />
So no. The difference isnt massive. I didnt say it was. But when raiding in a hardcore environment, If im doing 150,000 dps and I COULD be doing 150,001 dps, Im gonna go with the 1 dps increase.<br />
<br />
Im also really happy you felt the need to edit this in while I was posting while linking a NECK comparison. Literally one of the absolute worst pieces, in terms of flat out stats, for any single person.<br />
<br />
Honestly, you have no clue what you are talking about. Why did you even bother posting again? I used a neck... hmmm I wonder why?<br />
<br />
<br />
This really doenst effect hardcore raiders at all. Its still going to be better to use your valor to upgrade since there are more stats on fully upgraded 517s than fresh normal mode 522s for some unknown reason. <br />
<br />
Because that is what you can buy immediately the first day after the patch, genius. That is what we are discussing, can you follow? The whole point was deciding to use Valor on upgrades versus using it on new valor gear from shadow pan assault rep.<br />
<br />
Neutral - Neck<br />
Friendly - Bracers, Ring, Trinket (!)<br />
Honored - Cloak, Gloves, Legs<br />
Revered - Chest, Belt<br />
Exalted - there are shoulders available at this point which cost 1000g instead of VP.<br />
<br />
Please show me where the weapons are? Oh yeh.. you are clueless and post worthless information in an attempt to always be first.<br />
<br />
Also, did you really just figure out that the legendary gems are equal to about 4 ilvls on sha-touched weapons? Or did you really think there were &quot;more stats on fully upgraded 517s than fresh normal mode 522s for some unknown reason&quot;, and forgot about that whole legendary thing.... <br />

<br />
Your posts are bad and you should feel bad. You should also edit your blatantly incorrect first post.<br />
<br />
Funny seeing you get all emotional when you realize how wrong you were. Hope you don't trip over anything as you back away from your point that 522 gear is itemized worse than 517 gear, but at least little Moveth isn't so &quot;confused&quot; anymore.<br />
<br />
Also, just so you know, you can be friendly during the first week. So it is far more then just necks, four items actually, including trinkets that will finally top DMC for many classes (such as a healer like me).<br />
<br />
Also, even just looking at the neck, if you think upgrading 8 ilvls for 1500 valor instead of 13 ilvls (possibly 20 if still at 502) for 1250 valor is smart. Then... lol<br />
<br />
At this point all the best gear (weps, chest, legs etc..) on a heroic raider will be long since upgraded. They are down to the less important or well itemized pieces like rings/necks. The only possible argument is set pieces they just got, as that allows flexibility with keeping bonuses moving forward. A few raiders might make that decision case by case, but your first post it 100% false. Deal with it.</div></div><hr />

Their structure changed the moment WoW was succesful. They are a lot bigger than the past and that means you need the company adapt to keep functioning properly. Blizzard was not the behemoth as it is now. As far as i can tell Blizzard really changed their processes. People generally scream for this, but it takes some time to adapt to the new reality to keep such a massive game afloat. When they released Vanilla they didn't know the future would hold this, but if you look closely you see their structure changed (for the good). The thing is however that in Cata that adaptation simply wasn't complete yet, making for not delivering enough content and not be able to keep to the promised release schedule. But we are not in Cata anymore and lets be honest Cata was mostly a big upgrade pack needed to make it possible to continue the game in the future. MoP is a good sign they are on the right, because A. there is a lot of content and B. They seem to be able to keep their promises for faster content releases. If they can keep doing this we won't know until it is certain when the new expac arrives. Blizzard has a very difficult task: keeping millions of people bound for years to just one game. It's quite a feat they lasted so long while retaining millions of players.</div></div><hr />

Phewie! The little valor that i have on ALTs won't become justice, this is a neat way to get some new phat items. A chance to get some gear for 5.2 content! To catch up!<br />
<br />
Thank you, Blizzard! :)<br />

Farming Valor is skills? :)<br />

No just tired of Blizzard having to change the game for the people that play like 5 min/month</div></div><hr />

Your sense of hyperbole has vastly outpaced both your sense of reality and your sense of understanding</div></div><hr />

You obviously didn't read what Blizzard said, and jumped on the wagon of &quot;I complain hence i'm a better player than those who praise&quot;.<br />
<br />
Sorry, that doesn't make any testament for your skills. In fact show your READING skills are very poor.<br />
<br />
The old Valor gear aren't going to be modified to Justice. New Valor gear will be hindered in acquisition for reputation. Hoarding Valor is very limited by, well the Valor limit.<br />
<br />
There was no logical reason to remove Valor when they want people to use that with the discounted items on old vendors. Making a struggle between spending in old gearing up or new stuff is unnecessary when the very 3000 limitation already do the job.</div></div><hr />

One Blue said End of February (2/26), but comments recently made makes it sound more likely to be 3/5.</div></div><hr />

Of course we don’t tend to give out patch release dates ahead of time, because things can slip, but right now we’re targeting the last week of February.</div></div><hr />

Pretty much 3/5 at the absolute earliest. Consider the following two Blue comments:<br />
<br />
From the post about Valor today:<br />
&quot;If you’ve already made plans and sank your Valor, don’t fret! As of this announcement, and even if you have 0 Valor currently, you still have enough time to cap out at 3000 Valor before patch 5.2 goes live. (It’s math!)&quot;<br />
<br />
Based on that math, you need at least 3 weeks, so 3/5 at the earliest. One could argue that you actually need 4 weeks since at the time it was announced, you could already be at 0, and capped for the week (though they may not have considered that.<br />
<br />
Tweet from Bashiok today:<br />
&quot;5.2 date still not confirmed, but when you see the End of Season PvP blog it's a slightly more solid two week warning.&quot;<br />
<br />
No End of Season PvP blog yet, meaning 2/26 is pretty much out.</div></div><hr />

Its ok, you are in the extreme minority. Also, in 5.2 once you're valor capped, you start earning tons of Justice instead.</div></div><hr />

I can see that.. but man, if you are an experience player who is capping vp every week.. heirlooms are such an overkill. Just get the weapon and things die so fast and leveling is extremely fast also. I have had 10 capped toons for a long time.. so haven´t leveled a new character in awhile. I was amazed at just how fast and easy it is now.</div></div><hr />
