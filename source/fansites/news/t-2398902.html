Blizzard's Official Drustvar Zone Preview<br />
Blizzard posted a preview and lore summary for Drustvar today!<br />
In the land of Drustvar, the stalwart protectors of House Waycrest hold fast along the western border, but recently all contact with them has been lost. Travel beyond the frontier to learn of their fate and battle the resurgence of an ancient and terrifying enemy.<br />
<br />
Drustvar is a region known for the tenacity of the soldiers who protect it. Long after the defeat of the mysterious Drust who once dwelled there, the descendants of Arom Waycrest and his people continue to eke out a living in this unyielding land. They are known throughout Kul Tiras as being a hearty, stoic, and deeply superstitious people, and would make keen allies in the fight against the Horde—but now it’s up to you to discover why they’ve gone silent.<br />
<br />
Welcome to Drustvar.<br />
<br />
<br />
https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/may/thumb/drustvarpreview1.jpg (https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/may/drustvarpreview1.jpg) <br />
<br />
When first arriving in Drustvar, you’ll be greeted by a dark and foreboding shoreline on the eastern border. Drustvar is a rugged land plagued by superstition, and signs of witchcraft are everywhere. The pathways through Glenbrook to Fallhaven are fraught with danger, so you’ll need to stay on your guard. Dark rumors swirl as to what may have befallen the Waycrest family—and if the Alliance has any hope of convincing the Kul Tirans to join them, you’ll need to untangle the mysteries that lay ahead.<br />
<br />
Verdigris roofs and awnings adorn buildings of brick and wood, their amber window panes alight from within. The sea’s intrinsic role in Kul Tiran culture is reflected in the architecture, and anchors and other symbols of the sea decorate doorways and awnings.<br />
<br />
A stygian pallor looms over the town of Fallhaven, reeking of mystical meddling. A large and ominous construct stands as sentinel in the center of town, and the townsfolk are . . . unresponsive. You’ll need to work diligently to break the curse on the town before you can make any progress toward getting to the heart of the troubles in Drustvar.<br />
<br />
Cobblestone paths wind through the region and in and out of the various villages and towns. History and culture are deeply woven into the fabric of Kul Tiras, but so too are the workings of dark witches. Cursed and hopelessly twisted townsfolk and creatures work in servitude to these mystics’ machinations, set to a task you’ll need to decipher and put an end to—if you have the stomach for it.<br />
<br />
Visitors to this region will need to rely on their wits, solve a few not-so-small issues the citizenry faces, and hopefully make some inroads with the people along the way.<br />
<br />
Dark rituals are afoot in these lands. Will you be able to unravel their bindings?<br />
<br />
There are more mysteries to unravel, and an ancient enemy is stirring in the land, causing a tremendous slew of trouble.<br />
<br />
TAKE THE HIGHROAD<br />
<br />
Traveling westward will lead to a large chain of rugged snow-touched mountains running from the northern border of the region to the southern Iceveil Glacier, nearly bisecting the region in two. Along Highroad Pass, you’ll come across various wildlife and creatures, including Chillwind Yetis who find the cold of the mountains to their liking and food sources plentiful.<br />
<br />
The road is fraught with danger, but you’ll eventually arrive in the town of Arom’s Stand, which overlooks a valley to the west. A tribute to Arom Waycrest stands vigil even as the people here struggle against the darkness that has swept over the land.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Did you Know? Arom Waycrest was the first Lord of Drustvar, who helped his people overcome great opposition from a powerful enemy: the Drust.<br />
On the southwestern coast you’ll cross into the Crimson Forest. Various shades of red assail your eyes and bear witness to the veracity of the name. The town of Falconhurst sits on the coast, and as in your previous travels through the region, you’ll find this settlement is under siege by dark forces.<br />
<br />
Things to Try: Need a small break from saving the people of Drustvar? Visit the Falconhurst inn and join the children as they are regaled by stories and songs of heroic deeds and adventure.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
TAINTED RULE<br />
<br />
North of the Crimson Forest, the Ashenwood Grove bears witness to creatures adorned with fungi and strange creatures known as Fungarians patrolling the pathways. Farms dot the area and mines can be found dug into the mountainsides, but what should be bustling enterprises have ground to a halt as the witches’ special brand of pestilent creatures wreak havoc.<br />
<br />
Each clue found and mystery solved only puts forth more questions as to what could be ultimately manipulating events in Drustvar. Perhaps you’ll find the source of the troubles within Waycrest Manor*—ancestral home of the Waycrest family who watches over Drustvar.<br />
<br />
*Waycrest Manor is a 5-player dungeon in Drustvar.<br />
<br />
A vast coastline surrounds Drustvar to the east, south, and west, where those brave enough can fish, boat, swim, and hunt for treasure. Inland, the mountains and forests provide a chance to hunt a variety of . . . interesting . . . creatures. To the north, the rolling hills and mountains of Stormsong Valley await, while eastward lies Tiragarde Sound—and even more opportunities to earn your way into the good graces of the Kul Tirans.<br />
<br />

The 50% Rule<br />
I have put a lot of thought into this an hours crafting this excellent new rule that I very much hope Blizzard will implement if not now then in the next expansion.<br />
<br />
It is the 50% rule. Here it is: After one month of release, any and all content shall be completed by at least 50% of the players. In the event this is not the case, the content in question will be re-tuned so that 50% of the player base has achieved success in said content.<br />
<br />
...<br />
Just because content is not able to be completed does not mean it is necessarily broke or needs adjustment. Sure you can have things that function incorrectly and we usually respond to that pretty quickly when its current content and get it fixed.<br />
<br />
If we haven't adjusted something like say the Mage Tower by now, that means we think its working fine, which for additional context we do if the previous wasn't clear enough. It's okay to have hard content that you cannot complete. To me the game feels bigger if there are things I've been unable to do yet. If everything was easy and you could get any reward without any sort of effort then there would be almost no desire to play. It's a balancing act of accessible versus hard content but it doesn't mean you cannot still have hard content. <br />
<br />
Just because I can't do it doesn't mean it should be adjusted lower, that means I can do better to accomplish that goal. Sure it took me 140+ tries on my first mage tower appearance, but it was fun. Every death is a learning opportunity to figure out what not to do. It's intended for you to die and struggle but its designed so that it can be beat (Spoiler: All PvE content is designed so that you can beat it). With the increase in gearing, the Mage Towers are no longer as challenging as they were but that doesn't mean you get a free pass for a reward. You still have to pay attention to timings and learn how to do them. Mage Tower's are supposed to be difficult and the reward is considered a badge of skill with that spec, just like the Challenge Modes, and just like the original Proving Grounds. <br />
<br />
Being bad is the first step to gittin gud, before anyone was gud, they were bad. Not everyone is as equally skilled at the start but everyone can learn to git gud. <br />
<br />
Side Note: Your posts are irritating to read because of your random bolding of words. Let's cut that out or we'll start editing them in the future.<br />
<br />
The OP has endured the flame war, and was most gracious when this blue ordered him too goose step into submission with threats of Orwellian censoring.<br />
<br />
Everyone has an opinion about this game, the OPs is just an opinion, that is all. For a representative of Blizzard to threaten a paying customer with verbal throttling goes beyond the scope of reasonable conduct.<br />
<br />
I am neither for or against the OPs suggestion. I could care less. What I do care about is a Blizzard employee marching into this forum under the pretense of monitoring and instead berates and abuses whatever small power base they give them.<br />
Little hyperbolic don't you think? I asked Rastlin to please stop. They said sure. The discussion about it ended. Rastlin is totally fine to voice their opinion about content and what they feel should change about it, and there is nothing wrong about that. I suggested it because it is irritating to read because I see it in every post they make. You don't have to excessively bold, caps lock, asterisk, italicize, or underline to get your point across. If you can't then your point probably wasn't coming across well in the first place and you should start there. Rastlin doesn't need to do either, their point is coming across just fine. I may not agree with what they say but they're one of the better posters in that they make it clear what they're asking for.

Incomming catfight. Jaina VS Sylvanas. Two big tittied warmongers in BDSM gear. Two enter the ring, only one may leave. Who will win? The crowd, of course. Place your bets!<br />
<br />
Scenario 1: Jaina will just turn into a good person again with no explanation and Sylvanas gets defeated in a raid. She is put on trial by the nelfs, but she escapes to the Shadowlands thanks to Wrathion and raises an army of ghosts.<br />
<br />
Scenario 2: Sylvanas kills Jaina which finally confirms her as the villain of BfA and we cut her down in a raid.<br />
<br />
Scenario 3: Sylvanas will not face punishment for her deeds cause plot armor and bad writing. Jaina on the other hand will go full psycho and we kill her.<br />
<br />
Scenario 4: Neither get any character development or punishment because Blizzard writing.</div></div><hr />

Hm well Blizzard loves seeing characters simply disappear so that's the most likely.<br />
<br />
I mean... Sylvanas asked us in an epic way who was willing to avenge Vol'jin's death, but then we didn't even see her in Broken Shore or Argus.<br />
I think they're refraining from using Sylvanas at her best because they perfectly know she has to go full nazi and eventually kill her (nothing else would make sense).<br />

Well guess Jaina is going full garrosh too<br />
Daelin did deserve it, but it's not the killing of her father that's significant in that image, it's the decision she made at that moment that is.<br />
At that moment she decided that preserve peace, by not getting herself or her troops involved in the the fight that created the current situation Azeroth is in, if she had sided with her father their combined force could have ended the Horde, which was still establishing itself on Kalimdor,<br />
But instead she chose the road of peace, of inaction, that led to the current situation, the destruction of her beloved Theramore, and now a return to all out war between the Horde and the Alliance, and so she is regretting that decision now.<br />
<br />
I still think it was the right decision to make, Daelin was nuts, and wanted to eradicate all the Orcs from Azeroth, and as a diehard Horde member myself, she certainly didn't deserve to have Theramore blown up by Garrosh after all her efforts to keep the peace between the Horde and the Alliance, and I can totally see why that event is tainting her decisions.</div></div><hr />

It is just confusing because Thrall our lord and Savior, and Rexxar had no part of what Garrosh did.. I guess when something that bad happens to you, you lose rationality but o well. And if she killed Thrall the Messiah, he wouldnt have helped in Mount Hyjal, wouldn't have killed Deathwing, etc etc... Is Jaina the anti-christ? The Horde took down TONS of raid bosses.<br />

It's just bad writing after all these years. Rexxar says &quot;I love the Horde&quot;, which makes absolutely no sense and is an expression the likes no one notable has ever said of either faction. It goes completely against his character. <br />
<br />
Jaina in the comic is depicted as if she literally stood two meter away as her father died, but in the RTS she clearly says she can't watch them do that. She does however appear once he is slain, so I guess they could've gone with either option.</div></div><hr />

Comic art is interesting, but proportions go beyond stylistic choices into silly territory.<br />
<br />
Maybe I'm biased going into it, but I don't care what rationale Jaina gives for one-sided, misunderstood views of events. Bombing of Theramore was wrong, obviously. But then to extrapolate from that that everything else the Horde did was wrong (forgetting the Alliance's wrongdoing as well) is just stupid. She's an archmage...supposed to have some intellect.<br />

I'd assume because she's not in the military, not under the command of Alliance military forces, and did nothing to act against the Alliance.<br />
<br />
Heck, the bulk of the Horde and Alliance work is done by heroic adventurers working on their own free will rather than in military service. One might argue their military does very little thanks to us acting as mercenaries for a few gold and an enchanted bracer.<br />

Practically nobody who does anything of value is conscripted or enlisted. Weird to think about, really.</div></div><hr />

First bit shows parts of the story, then cuts to Ridorana the new 24 man just like WoW does small raid cuts in the videos, sneak peek at Eureka, then the dungeon, back to the story and the ends with a tiny sneak peak at the Ultimate fight.<br />

FF14 actually tried to be more WoW like with it's trailers since 4.0 believe it or not. Hence why they are shorter.<br />

Why aren't we court marshaling her on the Alliance side immediately after she returns?<br />
<br />
That one panel is only in there because people (rightfully) called Blizzard out for their horrible writing and how she literally ran away at one of the most crucial moments in wow's history, because the other council members allowed some &quot;ebil hordies&quot; back into the city, to fight against the fucking burning legion while they were invading the whole of azeroth on a large scale.. Now they can claim that she did fight against the legion as well all the time, even alone! And if they want to, they can claim she killed Sageras left toe nail during the ending cinematic (we just couldn't see because of the clouds!). It's a very shallow attempt at fixing something very wrong with the character..</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's so sad to see that the external community of wow is so lame, and i'm sorry guys but that is not just blizzard's fault, they have a part on it, but you people really love to make something out of nothing or a bomb out of 3 grains of sand.<br />
<br />
If I have to describe it in terms of community in an example, wow community is the opposite of the league of legends community, the first one has amazing people in game but terrible outside of it, and the last, has one if not the worst community in game, but a really amazing one externally.<br />
<br />
It is a fact that one of the reasons apart from blizzard making mistakes that the subs keep going down is this shitty external community that just talks garbage, who the f..k would enter a game or even test it, after reading what you guys say all the time, with not even one good thing to say?.

The texture work is just awful and it doesn't really seem to improve all that much between expansions so it seems like Blizzard has pushed the engine as far as they possibly can? With Unity and Unreal Engine improving a lot and being so easily accessible we now have indie-developers providing games with much better visual fidelity and textures than this. It's starting to become a problem for the game.<br />
<br />
Sure, its a old engine and what they have been able to do with it for all these years is really impressive. But we still pay full-price for each and every expansion, and we also pay a monthly subscription. It just feels odd for the game to be stuck which this old engine, with these low-textured graphics in 2018. I feel its time for something new?<br />
<br />
I do still enjoy the game, but these textures are just not cutting it in 2018. And we still have a lot of UX-design in the game that dates back to the games original release. It doesn't really fit a modern game at all. Why don't we get a overhaul? And the fact that they are strictly using the in-game engine for all in-game cut-scenes makes the low texture quality hurt the game even more. The in-game cut-scenes don't look all that great. Why not make all the big, important ones CGI like they did with WarCraft III, Diablo II, Diablo III, StarCraft II etc..? I can still watch WarCraft III cinematic and they look great, but when I look at the WotLK end cut-scene it looks horrendous... It's a real shame for the game.</div></div><hr />

Nah, the Blue has a pretty poor attitude. You also seem quite unusually angry. I wonder what's up with you or if you had a bad day as well.<br />
I wonder why you respond so.. angrily and throwing out labels in such a hostile way or I've made you defensive and read into my poss. Very curious... curious indeed.</div></div><hr />
