I'm curious why read so strongly into their statement. They said &quot;Wow, they really, really, listened to players's suggestions.&quot; Perhaps they were simply in awe that Blizzard (appears) to have listened to the player base, alternatively they could be saying this with derision but emotion doesn't translate very well over the internet.<br />

Sadly you are right... Right when there's tons of people defending Blizzard saying pandaren are NOT childish, they go and add this.... *sigh*<br />

And for those QQ'ing about pandas and &quot;awful&quot; dances in this expansion, I would tell you to grow up, but I guess you already did and forgot how to have fun. I hope they add a secret level in Diablo 3 full of dancing pandas!</div></div><hr />

<br />
The Male pandaren makes me cringe. ONLY because I freaking hate that song. At one point I thought it was awesome. Then the radio stations began to play it, and play it, and play it, and play it. I despise anything associated with party rock anthem, including that damn dance.<br />
<br />
Regardless it looks great, just a pet peeve :(.</div></div><hr />

You really expect Blizzard to listen to the community on something as minor as a races dance? That is something of personal preference for them and if people don't like it then they can cry about it like they already are.</div></div><hr />

So true.<br />

I love how animated the male pandaren face is during the dance--definitely going to have to roll one. That is an absolute riot. Can't wait to shuffle on players' corpses in PvP hahaha.</div></div><hr />

Did you really have to say that in comic sans though? /wrists :( lol<br />
<br />
<br />
On topic: I love that they went with Caramelldansen. It's by no means a song that originated from China or Japan, but it certainly has that ultra-hyper DDR Japanese-esque 120bpm feel to it, and that's more than enough for me (we need more dances based off music like that, imo, lol).<br />
<br />
My only complaint about it (albeit an extremely minor one) is that they went with the Ty Lee version instead of the original -- although I can see why they did (the original is kind of bland in comparison).. /shrug<br />
<br />
Oh, and, uh... brb, reserving Shufflebot name for my male Pandaren... lol</div></div><hr />

<br />
The female one is missing some elements of the dance as well. I kinda dig that dance now, because I assiciate it with the boobtastic version. Thanks for that btw, despite me detesting female pandaren and their dumb face, this will make me not kill myself when I see it ingame.</div></div><hr />

Since when has any /dance in this game made anyone look &quot;cool?&quot; From the first races modeled(humans, orcs) to the pandaren, the /dance has always been just unbelievably silly, and that's kind of the point: to be something silly and fun. <br />

Warcraft as a whole has never taken itself very seriously, and has always been full of random and silly things. That's just what Blizzard does.</div></div><hr />

Female dance is also okay, I mean, it's not like no one who knew what it was didn't expect it. And at least it's not Lady Woofwoof grabing her breats and crotch in a totaly &quot;Not sexy furry&quot; way...</div></div><hr />

Don't worry. Most animations in WoW are implemented by the &quot;throw shit and see if it sticks&quot; method, and dances usually have glue mixed into it to make sure they stick :P</div></div><hr />

What I wish the Panda male dance was like. The music in the background is terrible, but the dance itself... fits.<br />

<br />
I don't think there is a problem. The dances for other races don't really seem to be matched for their culture in any way (except for humans you could argue...because yeah, they're humans). People just make such a big deal out of the fact that the pandaren are based on chinese culture. Which to me still shows how far subliminal racist training goes because there was far less outcry about worgen and their cultural inspiration.<br />
People will eventually get over it, well those who still play at least and realize that blizzard didn't sell out to china and in fact are still doing the same as always.<br />
People simply have no idea what is actually going on in china when they claim blizzard sold out to china. They're just full of the shit they are fed to daily by the news.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is pretty much it right here. If they were going to subject us to this trauma (which I'm not against inherently, after-all we got a Britney Spears one didn't we?) the least they could do is animate it enough to make it amusing.<br />
<br />
+1 for the Party Rock shuffle though. I'm not sure how I feel about it on the Pandaren though, should be the new Troll dance instead. The Panadaren dance should be something fat people could actually manage. Seeing a pot bellied bear doing a lunging shuffle is a little awkward.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Maybe players would have problems recognizing it as a dance. They would be like &quot;why does every race get a dance and panda just does kung fu?&quot;.<br />
<br />
If they ever make a dance studio and implement that dance here, that's what I'm gonna pick for my Panda male<br />
http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=uP-oylFQ0Dw#t=16s<br />
<br />
As for the Panda male's dance, it does look like there are other bits from other dances, because I don't recognize them in the Party Rock video.<br />
Has somebody figured out what other dances are involved?<br />
<br />
edit: pretty much found'em all in the video now, just one bit, where he does this step forward http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=jENcCXW123Q#t=23s<br />
<br />
I can't find that anywhere in the video. I know I'm knitpicking here, but I'm just curious.</div></div><hr />

Out of place in WoW? Lemme give you a little history lesson in lore of this game. After the Horde vanquished this weak world, bathed in the blood of thousands slain humans, in their greatest hour of victory. They lined up in front of the still burning ruins of Stormwind, mean green skinned beasts with red eyes. After the screams and sounds of war silenced....<br />

Also the amazing facial expressions (that other races lack) are also winning alot of the &quot;votes&quot; here. But when it comes to the actual &quot;dance steps&quot; I can't say they are that full of &quot;win&quot; imo, or atleast I was expecting something way more epic. But this is just my opinion and to each their own!</div></div><hr />

Ok, let's face it, the story really began to unfold, after the green skinned beasts and the proud humans joined their forces, to help the elves and defeat a terrible evil, and after Azeroth was saved once more, the new found allies joined in and grooved on the field of victory, as nightelves do, lead by Michael Stormrage and Alizeé Whisperwind!</div></div><hr />

The dances for other races don't really seem to be matched for their culture in any way (except for humans you could argue...because yeah, they're humans). People just make such a big deal out of the fact that the pandaren are based on chinese culture. Which to me still shows how far subliminal racist training goes because there was far less outcry about worgen and their cultural inspiration.<br />
People will eventually get over it, well those who still play at least and realize that blizzard didn't sell out to china and in fact are still doing the same as always.<br />
People simply have no idea what is actually going on in china when they claim blizzard sold out to china. They're just full of the shit they are fed to daily by the news.<br />
<br />
Which is stupid. I like that they're implementing other cultural things. I'm pretty excited for Mists. I love the chinese art based style they have going on. Really annoying that there are people who think 'this is not MY culture so it's not okay!' out there.<br />

And now we get these pandaren ones. I'll give Blizzard credit the male pandaren dance is hilarious even though I can't stand the song it's based on. The female dance however is just... lame. All the weeaboos talking how great it is, or 'kawaii' just further state my point for how bad it is.<br />
<br />
Oh well 10/10 for male Pandaren and female 1/10. 1 for effort. Probably the worst dance in WoW apart from the dwarfs.<br />

Crazy you're replying to an argument I never made. I'm pretty sure I never once said the word 'panda'.<br />
<br />
You are aware that Blizzard originally made the Pandaren Japanese themed in samurai armor and received a huge backlash from their Chinese base over it, hence them correcting the theme to be Chinese themed, right? <br />
<br />
BTW, being an anime fan doesn't make you a weeaboo. Thinking that Japanese culture needs to be force fed down the throats of anyone partaking in anything remotely Asian is obnoxious, however. That's not a bias, and I use the word selectively.</div></div><hr />

The problem is rather that small group completely freaking out, foaming at their mouth every time they see something even remotely otaku culture related. Caramelldansen (the dance itself) originates from Popotan, which is certainly 100% Japanese. Another reason for you to start raging, I guess :)</div></div><hr />

I... wow, way to miss the forest for the trees. Take off your tunnel vision blinders and realize I never said it was offensive or that it had to be OMG Chinese, nor did I say Blizz was shoving Japanese culture or style down peoples' throats (keyword quintessentially, we both are aware it's not a Japanese song). <br />
<br />
What I'm bringing attention to is the fact that overzealous Japanphiles seem to think that any time Asia is referenced, there need to be nine million anime references, which is extremely imposing. Not everyone is an anime fan. Think about that objectively.<br />

No one ever said you were insecure.... holy crap, you're the one who brought up insecurity, lol. Nor did I ever stereotype anime watchers (guess what I enjoy!). Being an anime watcher doesn't make you a weeaboo, being an anime fanatic/otaku on the other hand, well that's arguable. <br />

Take off your tunnel vision blinders and realize I never said it was offensive or that it had to be OMG Chinese, nor did I say Blizz was shoving Japanese culture or style down peoples' throats (keyword quintessentially, we both are aware it's not a Japanese song). <br />
<br />
What I'm bringing attention to is the fact that overzealous Japanphiles seem to think that any time Asia is referenced, there need to be nine million anime references, which is extremely imposing. Not everyone is an anime fan. Think about that objectively.<br />

In response to the bolded sentence: I reckon that sounds like projection on your part.<br />

I hate to tell you this sir, but you're overreacting. WoW has tons of references to different things and I don't see you filling up with rage that they exist in the game already. Because some people dared to suggest that the dance(which never has anything to do with the race itself) be something you apparently do not like you decided that they must be trying to take over the world... of warcraft. I think the only one suffering from tunnel vision here is you.</div></div><hr />
