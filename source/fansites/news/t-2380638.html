This game has suffered long enough under the consistant player tyranny of &quot;This isnt fair&quot;, the setting for this expansion is a high fantasy, world war.

<br />
But it's always the same faction getting the focus, with a handful of small exceptions.<br />
<br />
I mean, look how more fleshed out and developed the Horde storyline is in Zandalar. Alliance is basically &quot;go kill some witches, and uh, yeah&quot;.<br />
<br />
So yeah, For the Horde I guess, time to reroll so I can get some interesting things.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Circumstances I suppose. It's not like they could go back on their design for the Zandalari and it isn't unreasonable to see why they went with these forms as opposed to the standard forms given their co-existence with dinosaurs and the likes.<br />
<br />
I mean, they could update the other forms but they're pretty much locked in to their local flavors.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You bet we will. I play Druid as Main since day one. <br />
<br />
Not only they come with those homogenization formula of druid forms in LEGION (I mean i do care if I look like a NElf or Tauren or Worgen bear/cat), they also were extremely lazy by not giving Moonkin Exclusive forms for every race just a lame staff recolor.<br />
<br />
Not to mention sticking with NELF, WORGENS, TROLLs and TAURENS old travel forms while Highmountain and Zandatrolls are getting new models. <br />
<br />
Lame fugly owl with recolors as lunarwing flight form.<br />
<br />
I hated that glorified phowlnix so much that I still using my old EXCLUSIVE swift travel form.<br />
<br />
Man someone pls tell blizzard that some players don't want to play allied races, just getting something new to their old classic races. That would be great.<br />
<br />
I really dont care about allied races and those exclusive new stuff instead of making me indifferent to them is making me hate my old toons...<br />

It's because we have yet to see if they're differentiating each race as drastically as the zandalari. They currently have the most unique forms in the game, while everyone else for the most part is a slightly different interpretation of the same base model, minus trolls (surprise surprise) who got a bat flight form.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, what do you expect? It doesn't make sense for them to turn into cats and bears, it's not representative of their culture, and Zandalari Dinomancers had already been introduced before Blizzard came up with allied races. This is relatively minor work creating a few models in order to uphold a very cool and promising race/class identity.<br />
<br />
This is just Blizzard NOT being lazy. If Beta unfolds and Alliance Druids don't eventually even out, then you can complain. But I would frankly be SHOCKED if Kul'tirans don't get this class with the Celtic wicker man theme so prevalent in Drustvar (which, incidentally, is also similar to Death Knight Malfurion in Hearthstone). And Sethrak are a great fit for a Druid of the Fang kind of theme.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But we can get some dinosaur forms they originally said they wouldnt do. <br />
<br />
Feels &quot;great&quot; being alliance. Are ally players going to get assaulted at this years blizzcon again?<br />

You can alredy see the Magh'ar Orc Wolf mount on wowhead... Dark Iron however...<br />
<br />
Man I guess the devs are incredibly regreting announcing Dark Iron. Thats a extremely dull toasted race. I can see they running out of ideas to make it cool. But as we all know they already passed the consumable point...<br />
<br />
Dull race with nothing cool about it to add. Thats why barely have anything about them or anything about the 4th ally allied race.<br />

Kul tiras humans were not announced as an allied race yet... and I always think, for a fantasy game, any human race is boring AF. Which mean I'm passing on them as allied race.<br />

Seeing that the model for Zandalari Moonkin seems to be made on the Arrakoa skeleton really excites me, because maybe it means that they're ready to develop them as an allied race if people are getting teh ability to play as that form... And even if they dont for awhile, I still get to play a Zandalari moonkin and enjoy the nice animations :D plus turtle-bear could be fun.<br />

This game has suffered long enough under the consistant player tyranny of &quot;This isnt fair&quot;, the setting for this expansion is a high fantasy, world war.

That's like saying Breaking Bad was a story about the police, because they came in at the very end to find WW dead.<br />

In BB we see WW's origin story, his rise to power, and his downfall. Just like Garrosh starting from TBC and going all the way into WoD.<br />
<br />
Anduin did what in MoP? Get his ass kicked? Hide out running around in the forest? I actually had to wiki Anduin to make sure I didn't miss anything. Don't need to wiki Garrosh to know what he did during MoP.<br />
<br />
The entire argument that MoP was &quot;For the Alliance&quot; is complete mindless drivel.</div></div><hr />

Not sure how I feel about it. It is interesting looking, to say the least. I planned on changing my tauren to zandalari anyway, and I'm still holding out hope they'll be able to be paladin...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Void Elves are reskinned Blood Elves. Shows how much you know.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Worgand</div><div class="date">2018-03-01, 04:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Let me start by saying I play both factions, so I don't have a dog in the fight, and when the Zandalari were announced I immediately said &quot;yep, making one of those&quot;. However, for this expansion I might just play Horde only, as the Alliance is getting completely shafted, they've gotten shiny space goats, outcast blood elves, and dark iron dwarves - all recolors and none interesting. How do those compare against Zandalari Trolls, with their entirely unique dino forms that blow the other races (both Horde and Alliance) out of the water? The Nightborne atleast have a new skeleton and are different enough from Night elves, whereas the highmountain are pretty boring outside of their new travel form. The horde also has the Mag'har Orcs being datamined, whereas we have absolutely no clue what the 4th Alliance allied race is going to be, not to mention no further work has been done on our third (the Dark Iron), while the Zandalari and now Mag'har are taking up the spotlight.<br />
<br />
Further, the Horde are getting upright orcs like thrall, whereas the Alliance are getting updated Worgen &quot;sometime during BFA&quot;...<br />
<br />
Not looking good for the Alliance so far, maybe our Boy-King will get kicked into another bell, but this time by Sylvanus.</div></div><hr />

It's clearly reference to Archaeopteryx Feathered dinosaur (the missing link between dinos/reptiles and current birds):<br />

They clearly say they are dungeon armor in the file name, if you hover over the icons</div></div><hr />

It's like they actually believe all the Horde players got together and decided to destroy Theramore or something.<br />
Bravo to Blizzard for causing immersion that deep.<br />
<br />
I'm pretty sure you're reading way too deep into a bunch of weirdos rping on the forums.</div></div><hr />
