<br />
Am the only only one who would be happy if the whole movie was just done as pure CGI with the same quality as the cinematic? Tho I guess the ammount of work I'd take would be just to much to handle.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is your opinion and I'd disagree with it. First of all, the cinematic is in completed form. The movie will likely be worked on until close to release. Second, they're two completely different art styles. The cinematic is supposed to look animated, where the movie is supposed to look real. This second process is alot more difficult, and it's really tough to make things that don't exist in real life look like they're filmed instead of animated. One tiny slip in the rendering can make a whole scene look odd, where a little slip here and there in the cinematic doesn't make much of a difference. If we're being nitpicky, I actually thought the rendering of Sylvanas was pretty bad and lacked alot of detail, especially in the face.<br />

You can't wipe out the forsaken if the legion wipes you out. I know you think you are smarter than the creators of the game but an army of sentient zombies you war over terrain with is &lt; than an army seeking to wipe out all life across the universe and all of creation. Why I have to explain this I do not know.</div></div><hr />

Varian has finally seemed to realize that things are much MUCH bigger than red vs blue, and sometimes old foes must turn into allies for either to survive greater threats.<br />

Yes &quot;Demons lol&quot; are coming to rape our skulls! Lets bicker over terrestrial stuff. Totally sensible to attack the enemy of my enemy that is of significantly less threat so AN INFINITE HORDE OF DEMONS can swoop in and murder us all without regard for jack.</div></div><hr />

Well said... Lot of person don't understand that the 2 are using different styles... I think what they meant to say is they've gotten so use to blizz cgi cinematic that they would prefer the movie in that style, than the realistic approach... <br />
<br />
I for one love the art style of the movie...</div></div><hr />

Not to mention Sylvanas looks remarkably less sexy, not even wearing her midriff baring armor. Renewed PC BS from Blizz is now ruining fantasy character art too I see.</div></div><hr />

It's a prerendered cinematic. Of course it has to look as good as possible and the cinematic team essentially just does the cinematics. You don't think the same level of effort went into all previous cinematics? &quot;The Cinematic looks too damn good! GOD DAMN IT BLIZZ!&quot; Of course, you know what would happen if it didn't look good? &quot;It looks like crap&quot;<br />
<br />
And boo hoo, Sylvanas is an undead. She shouldn't be sexy to a regular ass person. Y'know, by virtue of being undead and having a corpse for a body. Also, if you read the official lore on Sylvannas, it describes her as having her skin constantly peeling off and cracking when she moves and speaks. Heck, Metzens original concept art for Sylvannas(google it) has her clearly frankensteined and stitched up all over the place. But y'know, lets cry PC, because we're so bereft of things to complain about and petty that we need to pull complaints about the cinematics looking too good and Sylvanas the undead no longer being wank bait out. Sheesh. <br />
<br />
Lastly, there's /plenty/ of other sexy broads in WoW, don't worry, they're not coming to take them away from you.</div></div><hr />
