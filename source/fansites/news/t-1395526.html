Warlords of Draenor - Flying Delayed Until First Major Patch<br />
There's a lot of discussion about flying/not-flying and I'd like to try to sum things up and maybe realign the discussion a bit. Some of the other threads are near-cap, some have really gone down tangents, so I'm just picking this one to throw a reply into. Apologies to the other threads.<br />
<br />
We intend to disallow flying while leveling from 90 to 100, and have flying become available again in the first major patch for Warlords of Draenor. No flying while leveling has been the case during Burning Crusade, Wrath of the Lich King, and Mists of Pandaria. We allowed flying during Cataclysm because as those zones were mixed-in with the 1-60 world it just would have been really jarring to dismount you as you fly into Hyjal, etc. but we would have disallowed it for Catalcysm zones as well if there was a reasonable solution there.<br />
<br />
Flying trivializes combat. A lot of people like to say we're trying to force world PvP, or that we just really want people to look at the pretty trees we made, but those really aren't the reasons that drive this same decision we've made every expansion. Flying allows you to escape or enter combat at-will. There's a reason why flying isn't allowed in dungeons and raids, or battlegrounds and arenas, and that's because it would trivialize the core mechanic of the game in those areas - combat. For much the same reason it trivializes how content is approached in the outdoor world based on the simple fact that you can lift off and set down wherever you like.<br />
<br />
So that's the main reason. But sure there are a lot of other problems it can cause for content design such as zones having to get a lot bigger because flying mounts can travel so quickly (and thus making ground travel in them take much longer), it reduces the impact of elevation within zones, it completely removes the ability for us to pace or present content in any structured way, and in general removes our ability to determine how and when players approach a situation, see a vista or location, or charge into/out-of a combat situation. It just greatly reduces any gameplay we want to create by allowing infinite choice in how content is approached to best suit a player's intention to (usually) avoid that content.<br />
<br />
I totally sympathize with people's desire to do that, they want to be efficient and have it be their choice, but we have to balance our intent to create a game against creating a sandbox where anything goes. There's a happy medium there somewhere, but flying mounts in most cases just do too much to undermine too many of our core intentions with the game world, the basis of the game: combat, or guiding players through a game experience, and for those reasons we have continually chosen (when we could) to disallow flying mounts in the 'current' outdoor content. In the past that's meant only while leveling, but in our experiences with the Isle of Thunder and Timeless Isle we feel like we can extend that for a bit longer in the new content, and have it be kind of a big deal again once you're able to earn flying in the first big content patch, and in the meantime putting focus on flight paths as well as having some more interesting travel options for players to use. <br />

flying whilst leveling felt manditory before though, it takes away from the experience, I for one was glad in MoP we didnt have flying until max level, delaying it to 6.1 however instead of just max level limitation, is more controversal, depends on how they build the world, I shall wait and see and complain IF it pisses me off once I hit max level and really want flying (like I did with alts in MoP) to get dailies done faster - then again, they've said no dailies so eh</div></div><hr />

<br />
The logic for not allowing flying is sound. It really enables you to bypass most things and trivializes any obstacles in the world. However, I can understand the frustration from the players who are against it. It's no fun not being able to use your favorite mounts that you've worked for and are proud of. It's a complicated situation.<br />
<br />
My advice to anyone who's throwing their hands up and saying &quot;I'm quitting! GG Blizzard!&quot; is to wait. The expansion isn't even in closed beta yet. There's plenty of time for things to change. Nothing is set in stone until the expansion goes live.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The ability to use flying mounts doesn't entitle you to use them anywhere you want at any time. Do you think they should be usable in raids, dungeons, and battlegrounds? Aside from delaying max-level flying until the first major content patch—in Mists, this was exactly 2 months after launch, and there's no reason to think it won't be similar for 6.1—this is exactly the same as things have been for every expansion to date.<br />
<br />
Also, &quot;lack of content&quot;? Are you serious? I guess if you thought MoP had a lack of content... in which case, we're not even speaking the same language, and there's nothing to discuss.</div></div><hr />

I've felt ever since beyond BC, that they were a VERY bad addition to the game. Cool at first, but its become more and more evident just how atmosphere and immersion breaking they are for the game; A game entirely based on ground combat. It just feels weird and cheating to fly over everything that was painstakingly designed to be seen from the ground.<br />

Glad they're doing this. Anyone who believes otherwise, fine, we'll see you after the patch.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just because it's trivial to you doesn't mean it's trivial to others. Opinions, you learned something today! And yes, I'm a customer, so I'm priviledged or entitiled or whatever you want to call it. See there is this thing where if you're a customer of something and you are no longer satisfied you don't actually have to keep buying or using that product. You can actually stop! Another awesome thing you learned today. Often, there are alternatives to said product. Like other games, other hobbies, maybe I could even go outside!<br />

<br />
No new class, no new race. Only 3 new dungeons to level with. BC had like 14 dungeons to level with, and they're going on about how they hired a bunch of people and have more people working on this game now than they ever have. Sure doesn't look like it. We're being charged money for a glorified patch. It seems like they always try to piss people off as much as they can at the start of the expansion then spend the rest of it reverting and doing interviews where they talk about how they regret it.</div></div><hr />

Your the worst kind of wow player that the developers have to dumb down and cater to. It's half their fault tho they have been catering to spoiled players like you for so long that when u hear that you have to use a ground mount and actually EXPLORE the world they created you go nuts. This game was a much bigger place before flying mounts and i love when they do this it brings me back to when this game felt like a big expansive world. Not one you can just fly over in 5 minutes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
OT: i think this is awesome. i love my flying mounts but honestly, seeing the world from the ground for a while will be a welcome change. i actually loved pre cataclysm azeroth being ground only.</div></div><hr />

Why can't these people that feels like flying mounts &quot;ruin everything&quot; just use ground mounts then? Nothing is stopping you.</div></div><hr />

For example Dread Wastes is super scary when you're level 89, picking your way around crowds of mantid to get around. At 90, it's just meh, fly over everything, maybe have to take out 1-2 mobs to reach your objective, fly off. Sure, I'd be disappointed to never be able to fly, as I love exploring from a height, but spending a while on the ground first is the best of both worlds.<br />

As for the Hearthstone beta key, uh, thanks? I've only been playing it for a month already. Awesome gift for the folk who weren't in already but, yeah, slightly underwhelming for me, oh well, maybe one of my friends will fancy a go!</div></div><hr />

Actually they havnt... they have denied flying until max level before with all other expansions but never blocked any flying even at max level until the first major patch... the argument for during leveling I can agree with and have no problem waiting until I am max level but once you are there is no excuse for them to block flying. If you really hate flying mounts that much you can always use this magical thing called a ground mount... Seriously I agree with deathonabun they need to make no-fly servers.That would keep the whiners happy and most people will be happy to fly again at max level.

I don't think many here are complaining about no flying until max level that's fine that's normal. What we hate is that even at max level we will have to wait several months to be able to fly because a few people cried that they don't like flying but are too lazy to keep themselves from flying anyways...</div></div><hr />

It's half their fault tho they have been catering to spoiled players like you for so long that when u hear that you have to use a ground mount and actually EXPLORE the world they created you go nuts. This game was a much bigger place before flying mounts and i love when they do this it brings me back to when this game felt like a big expansive world. Not one you can just fly over in 5 minutes.<br />
<br /> 
Forcing you to use a ground mount isn't going to force people to explore. They'll just use flight paths and go take a dump. You always had the option if you want to run around on a ground mount and be Magellan. It's always amusing to me watching fanboys defend the removal of options. This is just a stupid way to force people to pvp. Considering the majority of people play on pve servers this is just stupid.</div></div><hr />

There will still be flight paths to any place of interest. They won't be bank-breaking. I'm sure most people will cope. I understand why they want to do it the way they have, Cataclysm was a mess levelling; especially combining flying and phased zones. The first major content patch will come shortly after you start raiding; before you know it you will be able to fly again.<br />

Although I think flying should be available at level cap, just like they did in MoP. I did Loremaster of Pandaria as I leveled, and the immersion was way better this way, leveling, questing and grindind without flying. Thunder Isle is different. It's not so big, as we had a lot to do there. Timeless Isle is too, but the thing is, once you I'm done with things there, it's a place I'll never set foot again, due to it's limitations.<br />

I can't speak for you but I hadn't finished exploring Pandaria by the time I hit level 90... Maybe they want to include some &quot;Isle of Thunder/Timeless Isle&quot; style max level zones, but rather than having them as no-fly zones they just let people fly on the whole continent when they no longer are &quot;current&quot;.<br />

Pandora's Box. I believe at least one of the devs has been quoted as saying that they would have preferred flying was never added.<br />
<br />
I can see it both ways. As a limited tool, it can create some amazing things (see Nagrand's floating islands, the entirety of Storm Peaks and Icecrown, and, albeit to a lesser extent, Deepholm), but when it's used in areas that weren't designed for it, it trivializes a lot of what goes into an area.</div></div><hr />

That's still not really a point though, because any benefit is gone the second you allow it. It's a small time window where content will be experienced exactly how Blizzard wants it.

This is why they should just implement servers where they restrict flying since that will cater to these people who just cant stand convenience and allow us, who actually are capable of deciding how to experience our 800th trip to dread wastes, the way we want.</div></div><hr />

Make no mistakes, flying mount take away a lot of scale and danger from the environments you move through. The ability to simply skip fighting your way to the next area if there or mobs in your path absolutely trivialises the content. This exactly why GW2 doesn't even have land mounts, even the ability to speed through areas enables you to avoid combat in many cases. Avoiding combat is essentially equal to avoiding gameplay.<br />
<br />
It's good news that flying will be turned off until the first patch, because it means people have to actually ride around on the ground and (the horror) occasionally fight mobs. If this sort of thing bothers you why do you even play? Personally I'd say turn them off until the end of the expansion, but we can't all have our own way. ;)</div></div><hr />

If by enjoying you mean swimming through an ocean of mobs whose sole purpose is nothing more than to annoy and daze the everliving shit out of us at max level. Then yeah, we're missing that so much.

I think every expansion beside Cataclysm did similar stuff. Do you not understand that, if, say, you level up to 100 in a single week, that'll be the only week when you won't be able to fly on that character in Draenor? Nobody's taking your mounts and even in Draenor, as soon as you hit 100, you'll get their use again without the need to wait for a patch, be it a major or a minor one :)<br />
<br />
So, in the end, in my humble opinion, if this is a dealbreaker for you - you weren't serious to begin with and tend to whine for the sake of whining :)<br />
<br />
&quot;We intend to disallow flying while leveling from 90 to 100&quot; - How is this difficult to read? no flying while leveling, nothing said about endgame, you get your shiny dragon back at 100 :)</div></div><hr />

Make no mistakes, flying mount take away a lot of scale and danger from the environments you move through. The ability to simply skip fighting your way to the next area if there or mobs in your path absolutely trivialises the content. This exactly why GW2 doesn't even have land mounts, even the ability to speed through areas enables you to avoid combat in many cases. Avoiding combat is essentially equal to avoiding gameplay.<br />
<br />
It's good news that flying will be turned off until the first patch, because it means people have to actually ride around on the ground and (the horror) occasionally fight mobs. If this sort of thing bothers you why do you even play? Personally I'd say turn them off until the end of the expansion, but we can't all have our own way. ;)<br />
Why do you keep assuming we are upset about leveling? I could care less about flying through leveling that's how every expansion except cata has worked. What we don't like is no flying at max level which there is no reasonable excuse for other than to cater to people who are so weak willed they cannot be expected to choose to experience the zone the way they please and must complain that flying mounts ruin the experience when they are plenty capable of going through it on ground mounts.</div></div><hr />

I get that they want to be able to have structured content and being able to choose your battles defeats some of that a bit too easily. Fine. They want to tell us a story while we get to level cap. Whatever.<br />
<br />
No flying at max level however? No fucking way. What good reason is there? If I'm max, I no longer care about leveling content. I care about efficiency. Running across an entire zone and being constantly dazed is not fun. It's frustrating. Why do I want to fight a pack of level 95 mobs if I'm at level 100? What good reason is there to do so? The only reason I would fight them is when I'm forced to by a silly dismount mechanic. So why shouldn't I be allowed to fly over them?<br />
<br />
Do you know what this is going to cause?<br />
<br />
People simply wont leave the city. It's not like we have to fly to dungeon entrances anyway. <br />
<br />
Flight paths are not fun, they take too long just sitting there with no ability to get off quickly if you change your mind or see something (say, a rare spawn). If you select a flight path that takes 10 minutes to complete, you have committed to that 10 minutes and cannot get off the taxi on a whim. It's a huge time-waste. Especially since FPs rarely go in a straight line, instead looping around the entire fucking map when you just want to get from A to B.<br />
<br />
&quot;But it kills immersion!&quot; you cry. I don't play WoW to feel immersed; it has too many pop culture references and too much humour for me to ever give a shit about being immersed. I play for the endgame, and throwing up another artificial time-sink to that is frankly ridiculous.<br />
<br />
What next, all rep factions require mob grinding like Emperor Shaohao? It wasn't &quot;immersive&quot; enough getting rep through tokens or instances.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It can still be withheld until maximum level; and as newer content patches come out and it is no longer necessary to restrict flying in wherever; whichever new zone takes its place can have flying restricted... <br />
<br />
In this way they can satisfy their own design gratification (people seeing the game the way they want it seen) and also the people for whom flying around is an important part of their gameplay. Are you genuinely refusing to see the reasons why they would want to restric flying at all; or do you just feel they aren't as relevant compared to yours (or others) desire to be able to fly the moment they arrive in Draenor, or the moment they hit level 100?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Second: I hope they get so much positive feedback when this is released, that they will be all &quot;Guys, let's just scrap flying for this expansion&quot;<br />
<br />
You know that's great, except, unless the world is built _very_ well (like at least as flowing and intuitive as most of Wrath zones were), all this is going to do is prevent a lot of people from taking the time to level alts. I know that not being able to speed up the 3rd and 4th time I leveled through MoP, I just stopped bothering. First expansion that I didn't have a full set of max-level guys at the end. Which, in turn, left me with a lot less to do, because healing raids and ranged dpsing raids and melee dpsing raids and tanking raids is like having 4 times the content, for me and most of my buddies.<br />
<br />
If you don't want to fly, fine. I get it. If you don't want to fly on your main for awhile, fine, I get that, too. I want to fly on my leveling alts, though.<br />
<br />
I've also never understood &quot;I'M GLAD I CAN'T FLY&quot; because, really, don't buy flying. Why is whether or not Bob can fly forcing Tim to fly. Because he gets mats faster when gathering, or something? Solvable problem, I got a ton of solutions. I mean, really? You'd rather not have the choice? People that want to see it from the ground could just not buy the flying. I did that in Wrath on I think 2 of my 10 alts. The ones I really liked to play the most, you know? The alts I leveled to see what they were like at max level and not because I specifically like them, I just wanted to get it done. <br />
<br />
I get the trivializing combat thing, so fine. Restrict flying to &quot;already max level, or alts of a max level main&quot;, Wrath style. Book of Flying. Why is that a problem? Once I've got a max level character, haven't I &quot;payed my dues&quot; as you so seem to want me to?<br />
<br />
I think it's just more of the &quot;If you have more than one character, you will have less fun than a person with only one character.&quot; business that started in Cataclysm. I wish it would go away.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard doesn't force anything on you. You are ALLOWED to use a flying mount. You could just as easily mount up on a ground mount and experience the zone the way you please. So why hold a gun to my head and tell me Im not allowed to use flying mounts anymore?</div></div><hr />

just to nitpick a little, wrath offered flying at 77 because you NEEDED to use it as Icecrown was constructed. Also, the heirloom flying license for alts was patched in later, not at launch</div></div><hr />

Even if their skewed take on how they think other people need to enjoy the game still remains, the ACTUAL majority of WoW players will have to suffer something they never asked for.

Fair enough; I've heard it referred to as &quot;Aimless Isle&quot; before. But do you feel they were generally negatively received? My experiences suggest no; the combination of random events; stuff to grind; rare mobs and catch-up mechanisms - including the mix-up of that Censor; I think for the size of the Isle, TI provided a lot of hours of gameplay.

We had this EXACT same argument back when they removed the portals. Remember those days? The Blizz apologists ran in saying good! Now people will go out and explore the world! What happened? It became world of queuecraft where everyone just sat there and refused to go anywhere unless summoned. One of the reasons this pissed me off, my garrison was going to be placed in shadowmoon, cause I like the idea of perpetual night. I'm horde. There is NO way I'm using a ground mount to go across the map every day to go to my garrison. Forcing people to either stay in cities or use flight paths is bad design. I'd explore more if I had a mount, not a flight path where I'm tabbed out.</div></div><hr />

Oh and the &quot;flying mounts dumb the game down&quot; crowd should honestly just hurl themselves from a cliff at this point. Do you really, deep down, believe that WoW leveling content has *ever* been hard? I will tell you now, it hasn't. The only hard thing in the past was finding warm bodies for group quests. Other than that, WoW's leveling has always been a mindless 2button rotation fest.<br />
<br />
I'll tell you what dumbs the game down, really dumbs it down; 1 set of armour shared amongst 4 classes. Every possible bit of customisation to gear being removed. Haste breakpoints and DoT snapshotting being removed. That's dumbing down, not fucking the ability to fly over a mob I would have 2-shot anyway.</div></div><hr />

Remember those days? The Blizz apologists ran in saying good! Now people will go out and explore the world! What happened? It became world of queuecraft where everyone just sat there and refused to go anywhere unless summoned. One of the reasons this pissed me off, my garrison was going to be placed in shadowmoon, cause I like the idea of perpetual night. I'm horde. There is NO way I'm using a ground mount to go across the map every day to go to my garrison. Forcing people to either stay in cities or use flight paths is bad design. I'd explore more if I had a mount, not a flight path where I'm tabbed out.<br />
Yeah honestly even with people not noticing things as much while flying people wont notice anything at all when they alt tab during their flight path.</div></div><hr />

This will be the first time (if they go ahead with it) that they haven't allowed the purchase of a flight license (or equivalent, as flying was a separate riding skill in TBC) when you hit a certain level. Having flying locked out in Draenor is going to make the new world very interesting. I like it. :) Chances are, though, that they will reconsider, as a large number of players are going to feel like Blizzard is taking away something very important to them. With enough uproar on the forums, they will definitely weigh up both possibilities: flight license at level 100 vs flight license patched in with 6.1.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But to have the entire continent be no flying for a while, plus have every current activity be no flying, completely marginalizes flying mounts, which I think do add something to the game.<br />
<br />
I agree, they certainly add positive things to the game; I fly near everywhere and I'd be a massive hypocrite to say I don't appreciate it. And sometimes, on the Thunder Isle, when I wanted to get somewhere moderately far from the beach point; I'd get frustrated with the &quot;daze&quot; mechanic dismounting me. Very, in fact. But my memories of that isle would probably also be a lot fewer if I hadn't. Compared to Wrath of the Lich King and Cataclysm I think they put a massive amount of detail into the areas in Pandaria; both the release ones and the later ones. I play a lot and I probably have not yet found everything that is out there. I don't blame this solely at the feet of flying mounts; but it was certainly a feature. I'm just going to pause here for the generic &quot;Nothing is stopping you stay on your ground mount if you want to&quot; Well, no, nothing is except sometimes people focus more on the destination than the journey. Removal of flying makes us (forces us) play at a pace that lets us see it all.<br />
<br />
And they have already said &quot;It won't be for ever!&quot;</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RumlyD</div><div class="date">2013-11-14, 03:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It should be blatantly obvious to everyone who watched/read all the blizzcon stuff that they have an explicit reason for removing flight until the first patch. A reason that did not exist for BC, Wrath, Cata or MoP. It's the simple fact that they are going to be doing timeless isle type stuff all over the place, with random rare/epic rewards tucked away in areas of the map that you might decide to explore. These rewards are obviously going to be at least on par with some entry-level raid kit, and so Blizz does not people flying around the world insta gearing their arses up, utterly trivialising the first tier. This is clearly the reason they are doing this, and once the second tier is out, they will happily turn it on again and people can get on with the usual WoW business of rushing through content as if the world is about to end.<br />
<br />
It's not like there won't be flight paths to pretty much everywhere you'll be wanting to get to anyway. You know, those things that people used all the way through Vanilla, because there was no flying at all until level 70. Or have people forgotten that those exist, because they use their flying mounts to go everywhere. The reaction a lot of people are going with, seems to imply that they had no clue about flight paths and were being forced to ride everywhere on land from the capital. Another reason why flying mounts are unecessary and game-breaking in so many ways: you already have flight paths to take you to pretty much every location.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Constellation</div><div class="date">2013-11-14, 03:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree the people saying they are unsubbing over this are hilarious but in all honesty this wont fix exploration at all. You can still explore on your ground mount no one is restricting you in any kind of way whatsoever by having a completely optional feature known as a flying mount.<br />
<br />
True that, but lets say you wanna explore on the ground, with no intentions of PvPing, or you're just coming late into the expansion and actually forced on the ground, and a high level player from the opposite faction wanna gank/fight you, you're basically an easy target. Of course if you're also max lvl, you can only hope to notice him before he attacks you so you can mount up your flying quickly, but still it ruins the immersion of what you're doing. If you're not eligible for the flying mount (As in low lvl) you're basically fucked. <br />
<br />
Having to be equally &quot;strong&quot; on the mount side creates equal opportunities, nobody can chase you, try to attack you, they do some dmg, you still run away, they mount up their flying and catch you up in no seconds, with ground mounts you will have a way out, if they chase you and attack you, and you're still on you're mount and they mount up, they won't catch you, so that will often be seen as a decline to fight, unless they're persistent and follow you till the end of the world, which not that many cares to do. <br />
<br />
And with exploration on the ground brings less knowledge of the area around you, exploring on flying is easier, but you'll just see everything, I feel if you're doing it on the ground you'll be more surprised to what you'll find around you.</div></div><hr />

While it will deter some players from buying the game (not that many at all, people will through a fit and claim to unsub but in reality they won't), it is for the greater good.

<br />
That's part of the reward for hitting max level... not having to deal with that piddlin' crap. <br />
<br />
Raids/PvP/dungeons really aren't equatable. If they were filled with mobs that were wholly killable by one person in a few button clicks, but were needlessly stacked end to end, then I'd be all for allowing flying mounts in them frankly. <br />
<br />
<br />
This wont drive people to &quot;combat,&quot; it'll drive them to just 1) run through groups of mobs hoping they don't get dazed off 2) Take unnecessarily circuitous routes 3) AVOID areas with mobs and therefore not explore said places or 4) AFK while on flight paths. <br />

I'm going with the latter.<br />

People have invested years and tens/hundreds of thousands of gold into flying for their characters, and some have spent real money on specific flying mounts in Blizzard's real money store.

That seems to be the case. They want to disable flying in any new content because they like forcing their style of play on everyone. They should have learned that this philosophy is horrible from D3.<br />

Maybe they should embrace flying instead of grounding everyone.

I for one welcome this! I've hated how dumb down exploration and travelling have become with flying.<br />
<br />
What is pathetic here is people like you who see someone, who is a customer, who pays for a product, not liking an announcement and is deciding not to pay for that product anymore and use that money to buy something else. On what fucking planet is that considered pathetic? What planet is that considered funny? How does it hurt you so much that you're getting angry over it? If my cable company makes some dumb announcement and I feel like it's not worth having cable anymore and I remove it am I pathetic? If Lays says they're going to start putting glitter in their chips and I decide to buy candy bars instead am I pathetic? Do you actually read what you type before hitting submit? I see people throwing the word hissy fit around, like they know what it means. How is unsubscribing from a video game and going to play other games a hissy fit? It's my fucking money I can do whatever the hell I want with it. I can literally choose any reason why I don't want to play anymore and it's none of your fucking business.</div></div><hr />

I mean I will definitely be here for launch, WoD looks kick ass, but why delay flying till 6.1? Seems silly to me. I understand the whole argument about immersion and pretty trees and instant bounce from danger tactic of flying mounts. However, for those who just absolutely despise flying mounts, why not just... I don't know.. pop up that ground mount? This is one of those rare situations where there is definitely a solution that pleases both sides of an argument. If you love to travel quickly, flying mount it up broskis! If you want to immerse yourself in the vastness of the pixels, summon your horse or wolf, and enjoy the scenery of what Blizzard worked hard for. <br />
<br />
I just don't understand why force players to do something for a situation that can be handled through personal choice. Again, if you want to fly, then fly, if you want to immerse, then ground mount. I know its a response that comes off a bit douchey but it is a legitimate solution. How is my flying hurting you? How is your ground mount hurting me? Summoning my flying mount is not making the entire playerbase summon their flying mount (would actually be so funny lol :D). It's a personal choice that won't hurt other players, rather than purposely force players hand in which case you're causing a whole new problem. I'm all for delaying flying, UNTIL max level, not until a whole other patch. Way too strict of a decision that could have been handled so easily.<br />
<br />
Another thing, why not just make flying available at max level such as in Pandaria, once you've hit max on your main, you did all the immersing, now it's time to rush on through with your alts, why delay it for an entire patch. One thing I'm saying for sure is, when launch hits, I'm not touching an alt until 6.1. Bad enough I won't be able to fly on my main, but on 5 other characters also? No way lol.</div></div><hr />

Exactly. Such a ridiculous line of reasoning. Not to mention that most classes (if not every class) have an ability that increases their movement speed by an insane amount or allows them to leave combat altogether.

The whole waiting for 6.1 is new, but the having to level without flying has pretty much been the norm in wow. Couldn't fly till 70 (68 Druid) in BC, couldn't fly till 77 (Until late in the expansion when they allowed you to purchase and pass down the cold weather books), and couldn't fly in MOP until 85. Where is this allowed flying while leveling being the norm in the expansion coming from since 3 out of 4 had large limits or disallowed it?<br />
<br />
As for the waiting until 6.1, well that could turnout to be a minor patch in 2 weeks that they plan or 6 months. I think worrying about until actually seeing what Warlord will look like and how it will shape up is pretty premature. <br />
<br />
I personally think people are right an they should make it a personal choice. Lower the flying speed to 160 (old normal speed) and make ground speed like 225 or 250. That way people can weigh the pros and cons of each depending on what and where they are going. I mean that would be a equal preferential choice based on the situation right? Wouldn't that be fun?<br />

Every time? You mean except Wrath, or Cata, or MoP? Which 'every time' are you talking about? The limit has always been max level. Once you hit max level you get your flying. However, this time it's not about your level but some arbitrary time when 6.1 comes out. Horrible idea.<br />

EDIT: Oh, and the first couple months of the expansion are more alive because there are simply more people playing. Not sure what you're getting at.

This isn't about my mounts, nor my ability to fly all the time. Restrict me from flying while I level, restrict my from flying in certain zones that you want to be experienced in certain ways. I'm fine with that, encourage it even. <br />
<br />
What I hate about this is the fact I'll be without flying mounts while NOT in specific areas, while traveling around (which we will be doing a LOT those first few weeks) from the different areas I need to be in for reputation with factions and where I need to be to pick up profession materials and where I need to be to use a bank/AH/Other city comforts. I'll need to do this by FLYING (!!) on a flightpath, with nothing else to do but go AFK and do something on another screen, completely ignoring the landscape I would have been paying attention to if I were actually using my own flying mount.<br />
<br />
And not just that. It's a time issue too.<br />
<br />
Go back in your mind to Mists 5.0 and forget the fact some areas are in accessible without a flying mount (mainly Tillers) and now imagine a typical day in those first few weeks, and doing Tillers, and Golden Lotus and Klaxxi dailies and now try to imagine that all that running around in Valley of the 4 winds, and Vale of Eternal Blossoms and Dread Wastes that you did was done on a ground mount exclusively. How much longer do you think that would have taken? I routinely had to go from 1 end of those zones to the other. It would have significantly added to the time I spent doing those things. And yes, they could get around some of that extra time spent by putting some well placed flight paths in the zone, but wouldn't that just completely defeat the purpose of not having a flying mount, if I'm going to be spending my time flying across the zone all the time anyway?<br />
<br />
So from my point of view all this no-flying will accomplish is that I'll be spending more time AFK while on flight paths and I'll spend large amounts of my time traveling instead of getting productive things done, meaning my possibly limited playing time just got sucked up by travel time, instead of playing time. <br />
<br />
(And I'll cut in on any nonsense about traveling being just as much part of the fun and the experience, cause it rarely is. There's a reason you are trying to get somewhere, being held up from that goal by random encounters just means I'm not getting done what I set out to do. That's a waste of time, even if it looks lovely while I am being held up, and I get a deep appreciation for all the mobs I aggro.)</div></div><hr />

And they don't even have to have flying mobs that knock you off your mount. They could just do a decent amount of damage and give them a huge leash. That way you either have to avoid them or fight them soon since you can't heal on your mount.</div></div><hr />

Of course if you're also max lvl, you can only hope to notice him before he attacks you so you can mount up your flying quickly, but still it ruins the immersion of what you're doing. If you're not eligible for the flying mount (As in low lvl) you're basically fucked. <br />
<br />
Having to be equally &quot;strong&quot; on the mount side creates equal opportunities, nobody can chase you, try to attack you, they do some dmg, you still run away, they mount up their flying and catch you up in no seconds, with ground mounts you will have a way out, if they chase you and attack you, and you're still on you're mount and they mount up, they won't catch you, so that will often be seen as a decline to fight, unless they're persistent and follow you till the end of the world, which not that many cares to do. <br />
<br />
And with exploration on the ground brings less knowledge of the area around you, exploring on flying is easier, but you'll just see everything, I feel if you're doing it on the ground you'll be more surprised to what you'll find around you.<br />
You do realize that if you don't want to be ganked... you can join a PvE server... besides many pve servers do more organized pvp than pvp servers. (I used to play on pvp servers until MoP) Your argument has no merit to it because removing flying at max level does nothing to stop this scenario. If you get attacked you cannot mount in combat so you are still stuck there being eaten by a lvl 100 who had nothing better to do. Even at max level you can be ganked because some people just have more pvp gear. I don't care for pvp and don't stand a chance against a guy in all the latest season's gear so this wouldn't do anything to prevent me from being ganked. Besides once again if you want to explore from the ground no one is stopping you there is no requirement to fly. If I'm not restricting your right to use ground mounts why are you restricting my rights to fly?</div></div><hr />

<br />
The same reasoning extends to max-level content. They already disable flying in patch areas, except where they can't for technical reasons, like Krasarang. Being able to fly up, avoid everything you don't need and drop yourself where you need to be is an issue for them because of the impact that it has on their area design. If you want to put an obstacle between a player and an objective, that becomes a hell of a lot more difficult in a flying environment.<br />

Do you remember the shitstorm of that?<br />
<br />
This is much, much better.<br />
<br />
Learning to avoid mobs and obstacles is much better than not being allowed to fly at all. You do it on the ground so you dont aggro stuff, you can do it in the air. Also I would probably add a parachute mechanic for dismounting and place an altitude limit on mobs so you can safely fly higher for long distances.<br />
<br />
BTW the kaliri birds were only slightly higher than the trees and could be flown over if going to SMV. They were only there to make flying around the quest area harder which is exactly what Blizzard is trying to do by not letting us fly at all.</div></div><hr />

On a side note, if they removed the ability to fly, their solution would probably be to just keep flying mounts and convert them to ground mounts.

<br />
This is a fantastic idea, flying has had a detrimental effect to this game and people forget this is World of Warcraft and its about exploring the world, not just mounting and skipping 90% of the landscape/content to do circles/go afk in your home city<br />
<br />
Travelling before flying was sometimes dangerous i for one miss that feeling where i could be ganked at anytime by random mobs, something the game misse Immersion <br />
<br />
I can see the incoming QQ about how people wont sub til 6.1 or buy until flying is back, well that could be 3/4 months and then you will still have to level to 100 and buy flying.<br />
<br />
A possible solution is to add flying mobs in zones where you can be attacked and dismounted if they get to you, the skies should not be safe just as the ground isn't.</div></div><hr />

Ok agreed blizz should focus on interesting mechanics instead of convenience. But what is the interesting mechanic is denying flying for a patch? You want to deny flying while leveling go right ahead you have reasoning for that with flying making the quests too trivial. But what does it serve at max level? where you can literally play the game without leaving the capital city anyways? You still have the option to use a ground mount if you want. If you really find it far more enjoyable to run through a zone on the ground THEN DO SO. But why force us to not be able to fly because you just cant be asked to avoid convenience for something you say you value so much yet refuse to do.</div></div><hr />

We don't know how an entire expansion of no-flying content would pan out post-BC, and this gives us a chance to see that, at least for one patch. It lets Blizzard gauge the response, gather player stats and see just what's what on a more practical level. Betas don't make for particularly good simulations of something so heavily focused on player behavior and activity, and it's definitely worth letting it ride out for one patch cycle and seeing how it goes.<br />

Does flying ruin immersion and make exploring less fun. Sure. But if you really hate flying while exploring so much.. why don't you just use a ground mount? Removing flying isn't adding anything for you its just removing stuff from us. If you want to use a ground mount YOU CAN! obviously the fact that they are going with this means everywhere should be accessible from the ground meaning there is absolutely no excuse as to why you are &quot;forced to use flying mounts&quot; im sorry I didn't realize convenience was being forced upon you. Don't punish me because you have the ability to choose how you want to experience a zone but lack the will to throw off convenience in favor of experience.

This isn't about my mounts, nor my ability to fly all the time. Restrict me from flying while I level, restrict my from flying in certain zones that you want to be experienced in certain ways. I'm fine with that, encourage it even. <br />
<br />
What I hate about this is the fact I'll be without flying mounts while NOT in specific areas, while traveling around (which we will be doing a LOT those first few weeks) from the different areas I need to be in for reputation with factions and where I need to be to pick up profession materials and where I need to be to use a bank/AH/Other city comforts. I'll need to do this by FLYING (!!) on a flightpath, with nothing else to do but go AFK and do something on another screen, completely ignoring the landscape I would have been paying attention to if I were actually using my own flying mount.<br />

That's a waste of time, even if it looks lovely while I am being held up, and I get a deep appreciation for all the mobs I aggro.). <br />
<br />
<br />
Exactly. The reasoning is that they've made very little content this expansion and they want to prolong it as much as possible. If you don't want to get ganked join pve server. Immersion is relative to the player. My immersion comes from flying around new territories and getting a better view and the artwork of the game. This is ridiculous. Flying has never been mandatory and I have a full time job and 15 credit hours or more each semester. This travel time will do nothing but make the game feel like a chore. Absolutely hysterical.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, sure there is. Excuse me while I roll my eyes. I think we all know we'll still be 2-shotting mobs. Blizzard has never made dangerous leveling content. Ever. And I've played it all. As a Fury Warrior in Vanilla even.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Making flying dangerous with a dismount threat is not the same as what they're going for. If Blizzard wants you to encounter some specific obstacle or event on the ground, flying is still undermining that, even with aerial risks. They don't just want to make the world dangerous, they also want to add structure to their content; the ability to jump from place to place and avoid everything in between (including land barriers) is what damages that, regardless of how dangerous flying actually is. This is without even considering how they'd plan to make a flying threat in large, open areas.<br />
<br />
As I said, they already do it with the Heart of the Aspects and, unless I'm mistaken, the bat. They both fly on the ground rather than run, and yet, they can be used as ground-only mounts. It's not a new concept to Blizzard.</div></div><hr />

Go back in your mind to Mists 5.0 and forget the fact some areas are in accessible without a flying mount (mainly Tillers) and now imagine a typical day in those first few weeks, and doing Tillers, and Golden Lotus and Klaxxi dailies and now try to imagine that all that running around in Valley of the 4 winds, and Vale of Eternal Blossoms and Dread Wastes that you did was done on a ground mount exclusively. How much longer do you think that would have taken? I routinely had to go from 1 end of those zones to the other. It would have significantly added to the time I spent doing those things. And yes, they could get around some of that extra time spent by putting some well placed flight paths in the zone, but wouldn't that just completely defeat the purpose of not having a flying mount, if I'm going to be spending my time flying across the zone all the time anyway?<br />
<br />
So from my point of view all this no-flying will accomplish is that I'll be spending more time AFK while on flight paths and I'll spend large amounts of my time traveling instead of getting productive things done, meaning my possibly limited playing time just got sucked up by travel time, instead of playing time. <br />
<br />
(And I'll cut in on any nonsense about traveling being just as much part of the fun and the experience, cause it rarely is. There's a reason you are trying to get somewhere, being held up from that goal by random encounters just means I'm not getting done what I set out to do. That's a waste of time, even if it looks lovely while I am being held up, and I get a deep appreciation for all the mobs I aggro.)<br />
<br />
While a good point you need to remember 6.0 isn't going to be like 5.0's daily fest for end-game.<br />
<br />
They more or less are phasing flying into a thing thats given in later content to speed things up. For example the island added in 6.1 will then not allow flying.</div></div><hr />

Was also looking forward to doing the new archaeology too, but that's that profession down the drain until 6.2 (which will be at least 3-4 months after the ex-pac comes out) As I doubt people will want to spend 30+ mins traveling between just 2 dig-sites on a ground mount in quest greens/dungeon blues, getting dazed off of their ground mounts and constantly killed in the process &gt;_&gt;<br />
<br />
It'll also give the bots free reign where mining/herb nodes are concerned as no flying won't affect their speed hacks, so completely removes player competition for them &gt;_&gt;<br />

Also for those that don't know/miss-understand patch numbers:<br />

This. 100 percent, absolutely this. I think back to those early months of MoP and doing all those daily grinds and I think about how close I was to quitting this game (and most likely would have, if I didn't have such a great raid group). If we're in a situation in WoD where we have even three rep grinds to do at the outset of the expansion to gear up for raid content, and I have to criss-cross the content on taxi mounts, or try to finish the daily quests on my ground mount until they drop patch 6.1, I may very well quit. I don't got time for that shit: I'm here to raid with my friends, not experience the mandatory narrative that Blizz insists I should experience.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Exactly. The reasoning is that they've made very little content this expansion and they want to prolong it as much as possible. If you don't want to get ganked join pve server. Immersion is relative to the player. My immersion comes from flying around new territories and getting a better view and the artwork of the game. This is ridiculous. Flying has never been mandatory and I have a full time job and 15 credit hours or more each semester. This travel time will do nothing but make the game feel like a chore. Absolutely hysterical.<br />
Indeed and the worst part is that by removing flying they aren't even adding anything to the game (outside the obvious they are just removing the mechanic of flying) lack of flying adds no interesting dynamics to the game it just brings back inconvenience. If you want to experience everything without flying... don't fly.. no one is forcing you. Hopefully blizz realizes that this is not the majority that cares about ground mounts so much they wont even use them yet will happily complain in forums because of it.</div></div><hr />

If Blizzard wants you to encounter some specific obstacle or event on the ground, flying is still undermining that, even with aerial risks. They don't just want to make the world dangerous, they also want to add structure to their content; the ability to jump from place to place and avoid everything in between (including land barriers) is what damages that, regardless of how dangerous flying actually is. This is without even considering how they'd plan to make a flying threat in large, open areas.<br />
<br />
As I said, they already do it with the Heart of the Aspects and, unless I'm mistaken, the bat. They both fly on the ground rather than run, and yet, they can be used as ground-only mounts. It's not a new concept to Blizzard.<br />
<br />
A lot of flying mounts are usable in ground-only places, but it's pretty stupid to have a drake you can never fly on.</div></div><hr />

I always love posts like this. People with no information whatsoever making blanket statements like they are fact. How do you know how much content has been created? If they had a new race or class would that be content? I don't even see how that would be content. It's just another way to play through the exact same content as everyone else. They already stated their reasons on why they are doing it. Now we should all feel sad because this guy has a busy life.. because nobody else has that type of life either.<br />

<br />
This isn't about my mounts, nor my ability to fly all the time. Restrict me from flying while I level, restrict my from flying in certain zones that you want to be experienced in certain ways. I'm fine with that, encourage it even. <br />
<br />
What I hate about this is the fact I'll be without flying mounts while NOT in specific areas, while traveling around (which we will be doing a LOT those first few weeks) from the different areas I need to be in for reputation with factions and where I need to be to pick up profession materials and where I need to be to use a bank/AH/Other city comforts. I'll need to do this by FLYING (!!) on a flightpath, with nothing else to do but go AFK and do something on another screen, completely ignoring the landscape I would have been paying attention to if I were actually using my own flying mount.<br />
<br />
And not just that. It's a time issue too.<br />
<br />
Go back in your mind to Mists 5.0 and forget the fact some areas are in accessible without a flying mount (mainly Tillers) and now imagine a typical day in those first few weeks, and doing Tillers, and Golden Lotus and Klaxxi dailies and now try to imagine that all that running around in Valley of the 4 winds, and Vale of Eternal Blossoms and Dread Wastes that you did was done on a ground mount exclusively. How much longer do you think that would have taken? I routinely had to go from 1 end of those zones to the other. It would have significantly added to the time I spent doing those things. And yes, they could get around some of that extra time spent by putting some well placed flight paths in the zone, but wouldn't that just completely defeat the purpose of not having a flying mount, if I'm going to be spending my time flying across the zone all the time anyway?<br />
<br />
So from my point of view all this no-flying will accomplish is that I'll be spending more time AFK while on flight paths and I'll spend large amounts of my time traveling instead of getting productive things done, meaning my possibly limited playing time just got sucked up by travel time, instead of playing time. <br />
<br />
(And I'll cut in on any nonsense about traveling being just as much part of the fun and the experience, cause it rarely is. There's a reason you are trying to get somewhere, being held up from that goal by random encounters just means I'm not getting done what I set out to do. That's a waste of time, even if it looks lovely while I am being held up, and I get a deep appreciation for all the mobs I aggro.)<br />
<br />
a) Gryphons are as fast as flying mounts and in some cases faster. You won't lose much of your &quot;precious&quot; time.<br />
<br />
b) 90% people do afk while flying right now. it's called autorun<br />
<br />
c) What kind of productive work can you actually do while afking on a flying mount?</div></div><hr />

Problem is removing flying adds nothing to the game as people will still want to avoid their content. Everything can be que'ed from in capital cities anyways so whats the point of forcing ground mounts at max level. And if people really wanted to use their ground mounts so badly they would have in the past. There is nothing stopping anyone from literally doing this themselves right now in MoP... so they already have their turn. Why postpone mine? Btw watch as within a month all those people who are praising no flying revoke what they say and start complaining because they have to run on the ground. Theres a reason they don't do it now. And its not because its mandatory...<br />

People are always going to take the shortest route in regards to reward-driven content. &quot;More convenient&quot; doesn't always mean &quot;better for the game&quot; or, in some cases, &quot;more fun&quot;, and flying over something doesn't mean that what they flew over is trashy.</div></div><hr />

Really? Mounts are completely cosmetic in this game. There's no reason except cosmetics to have more than one, and most people here probably have more than a hundred, if not hundreds. Everything to do with mounts in this game - especially a reference to something as specific as a dragon - is entirely cosmetic.<br />

I don't need information. I can read and have common sense.

You're trying to say that a mount should be able to fly based on how it looks. Mounts can't do anything based on how they look in this game, some have appearances that outright defy what the game says they should be doing at that point (the previously-mentioned Heart of the Aspects being used in ground-only zones and still flying at ground level) and some just ignore the aesthetic elements and use other reasons to do what they do, like the Headless Horseman's mount being able to fly.<br />

&quot;My mount has wings but can't fly, that's dumb&quot; just doesn't hold water in a game where mounts have a plethora of visual features that don't amount to any kind of function.</div></div><hr />

Many things they are choosing to do in this xpac removes choice. In my experience choice is always better, so continue to strip away features of this game and bring us back to 2004. Think this game has been bleeding subs badly so far? watch the exodus if these changes come to pass, then all you who are in favor of these terrible choices, enjoy your game when updates are few and far between since supporting a dying game isn't profitable. Always been said that the real WoW killer is Blizzard itself, sure seems they are hell bent on making that happen quickly. <br />
<br />
It never ceases to amaze me all the masochists that play this game, I mean WTF?</div></div><hr />

People blaming the &quot;vocal minority&quot; or &quot;people who whined about wanting flying removed&quot; are missing the mark entirely. This isn't about people getting what they want, it's about Blizzard designing their game how they want it to be experienced. A game loses its luster once the challenge is trivial, and that is exactly what flying does. The experience will be better for it. <br />
<br />
For anyone who wants to use flying simply for travel, and not to skip challenges, there are flight paths that adequately accomplish that job.</div></div><hr />

Just don't use your flying mount if you want to explore and let us who don't give a crap still use it.<br />
This this a thousand times this. The most hilarious part is some of us have been saying that this whole thread and no one has yet to reply to us on those comments because they realize that they have no argument. There is no reason they should do this because they have every option to do it themselves now. If you don't want convenience and would rather have the experience of riding a ground mount then no one is stopping you. Why are people so ignorant?</div></div><hr />

Mounts can't do anything based on how they look in this game, some have appearances that outright defy what the game says they should be doing at that point (the previously-mentioned Heart of the Aspects being used in ground-only zones and still flying at ground level) and some just ignore the aesthetic elements and use other reasons to do what they do, like the Headless Horseman's mount being able to fly.<br />

&quot;My mount has wings but can't fly, that's dumb&quot; just doesn't hold water in a game where mounts have a plethora of visual features that don't amount to any kind of function.<br />
<br />
I'm saying that a mount that can fly prior to me owning it, it should still be able fly when I own it.</div></div><hr />

And they should also be able to fly you in ground-only zones, but they can't. The subject of your complaint already exists, and similar complaints about various things that creatures can and can't do before and after becoming a mount are possible for pretty much everything.</div></div><hr />

And having limited areas that force that upon you are bearable, but eliminating flying entirely and having mounts that can fly be unable to ever fly is ridiculous.</div></div><hr />

For anyone who wants to use flying simply for travel, and not to skip challenges, there are flight paths that adequately accomplish that job.And so if your best answer is just that flight paths can fulfill travel to then why shouldn't I be allowed to fly? Flying lets me check out things from a new perspective and see things I wouldn't have been able to without. And yes I DO use flying like that. Especially when im bored waiting for a que that with or without flying mounts I could have just sat in the capital city for. So really what does removing them help?</div></div><hr />

<br />
No more ridiculous than every other gameplay-related restriction on mounts. They're completely subservient to gameplay, and everything they do should be determined on the basis of that, not whether or not the model happens to have wings.</div></div><hr />

<br />
you people are. you can't control your damn selves and use the ground mount for the &quot;immersion&quot; you oh so want, but instead you want to control the way other people play the game. people like this are really the worst type of people. <br />
<br />
<br />
whatever really. i'll be too busy shitting myself over my garrison and stuff to care about it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shudder</div><div class="date">2013-11-14, 04:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Also, just pointing this out. They're also removing flight paths. Look at the reason why they said they are delaying flying. That it trivializes the areas, makes them not dangerous, that flying is used to skip content. Well flight paths do all that too. So if they are serious, they'll be delaying flight paths till 6.1. Confirmed.</div></div><hr />

Indeed at least this expansion looks good regardless of whatever they do with flying. Just hopefully blizz comes to their senses before launch.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There you go, you answered it in your own question. If your argument is that you need flying mounts to travel, my answer (and Blizzards, which is far more important) is that you may take flight paths so you don't have to gallop cross-continent. <br />
<br />
<br />
So really what does removing them help?<br />
<br />
The rest of my post is an answer to this very question.</div></div><hr />
