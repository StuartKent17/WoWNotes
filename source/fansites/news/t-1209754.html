Also, 4 druids ? Reminds me of their T12 Nef kill where they stacked druids for the bleed damage due to mechanics. <br />

Now do it in 25 man... oh wait.</div></div><hr />

This. I'd bet any amount of money that 25 mans are gone in the next expac if not before then. Large raids have been a dying breed and will become extinct. Blizz will settle on either 10 or 15 max soon.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I remember them saying that, in hindsight, 15 probably should have been the number to stick with, but the jump from 40 to 25 was so devastating that they'd rather not put guilds in a position to cut rosters again.<br />
<br />
But then, devs change their minds.</div></div><hr />

<br />
most of this is just coming from the idea that the next 10m is 2/6 while multiple 25s are at 4/6 or more. really its all perception and opinion and its a discussion that really will never be settled.<br />

I'm not here to talk shit, but consider the level of &quot;taking things very seriously&quot; a group of players goes through in order to drop 80% of a world-class roster in order to maintain World firsts. I've heard Riggnaros (raid leader of Blood Legion) paraphrased as saying, &quot;We just focus on what we're doing and don't pay attention to anybody else.&quot; Personally, I'd rather play with them then get axed because I'm sleeping more than 4 hours a night.<br />
<br />
<br />
You realized they went down to 10 man because so many of their members quit during the horrible tier that was DS... and these raiders weren't interested in doing anymore WoW.<br />
<br />
They also are a Finnish speaking guild, and so they can't just recruit anyone, as they have to find other players who speak Finnish.<br />
<br />
They didn't axe 80% of their because they sleep too much. Most of their roster quit because of how bad the game was becoming, or it was time for them to move on in life. They were forced to go 10 man because they didn't have enough players for 25 man.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Big congrats to them. This 10v25 debate is so silly, as a bunch of people who (probably) aren't better than 6/6 (or much worse) are sitting here arguing that they all have first hand experience that ____ difficulty is much harder this tier, when they aren't even close to the level that any of these guilds (Paragon, BL, Method, etc) are competing at. Please stop thinking that if your guild raided 12+ hours a day you would be 6/6H, cause you wouldn't be. This is a very impressive feat and should be treated as such.<br />
<br />
Would love to see Blood Legion get World First 25 Man and see all the 25 man fanboys cry about how all of a sudden Paragon's kill really is World First (simply because they hate BL or want a EU guild on top).</div></div><hr />

Uhm.... what are you talking about? they never merged with another guild, DREAM is their sponsor not another guild that merged with them,they just changed their name, they raid 10 man now because a lot of their core members have quit playing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
10s &lt; 25s when you have crap players you need to put on your shoulders. Also, Paragon's post of 10 vs 25 in Firelands also was using top geared players from 25 man gearing across two tiers of gear. If they were only 10m geared, had to deal with incredible trinket RNG (we never got a Shard of Woe... not one) and couldn't just swap classes on a whim (we had 11 raiders, not 25 to draw from) then 10 would have been way harder. Thus the major nerfs on heroic Rag, but not on 25 rag.<br />
<br />
Blizz intentionally makes 25 easier because the margin of error in 25 can't be the same as 10, otherwise even top guilds wouldn't get it down.</div></div><hr />

The reason DREAM Paragon is world first is because they're talented raiders, but most of the rest of talented HC's are on 25's. 10's are easier and there simply isn't enough HC talent on the other 10 teams, hence the difference in bosses cleared between the tiers.<br />

Even Paragon said 10 man wasnt legit in Cata. Less than 1% of the wow population could even make their 25 man, much less their 10. When you have 10 of the absolute best players in the world, of course you are going to roll through 10 mans. If you think about their recruitment policies, its no wonder they had to go 10 man even if they didnt want to do so.</div></div><hr />

People like to forget that raids are tuned for 25 man and then adjusted for 10, and sometimes leave fights literally near impossible in 10 man.

<br />
As for the other fights, we'll see how they pan out in terms of difficulty. What ends up happening is that hard DPS checks end up easier on 10 man, as well as &quot;don't chain damage&quot; fights, because there's more room to spread out. Hard mechanics fights (covering all the onsalughts in H-Blackhorn, properly doing lightning totems on H-Hagara come to mind) tend to be harder on 10 man, because 10 man covers the same space with less people and generally everyone has to deal with the mechanic while in 25m you have pure nukers vs. the people handling the mechanics. So far, I think spiritbinder is the only real mechanics fight in MSV. Stone Guards would have been another one had 10 man gotten 4 dogs too, but they didn't. Spirit Kings might be another, but idk, since no one but Paragon has even been that far in 10 man.</div></div><hr />

What ends up happening is that hard DPS checks end up easier on 10 man, as well as &quot;don't chain damage&quot; fights, because there's more room to spread out. Hard mechanics fights (covering all the onsalughts in H-Blackhorn, properly doing lightning totems on H-Hagara come to mind) tend to be harder on 10 man, because 10 man covers the same space with less people and generally everyone has to deal with the mechanic while in 25m you have pure nukers vs. the people handling the mechanics. So far, I think spiritbinder is the only real mechanics fight in MSV. Stone Guards would have been another one had 10 man gotten 4 dogs too, but they didn't. Spirit Kings might be another, but idk, since no one but Paragon has even been that far in 10 man.<br />

No one even knows how Paragon did it, but they're the only ones in the world to do it.. There's a hard wall in 10 man there, and it is beyond a doubt harder than 25m Garajel. People like to forget that raids are tuned for 25 man and then adjusted for 10, and sometimes leave fights literally near impossible in 10 man. Sinestra didn't get killed in 10 man heroic til FEBRUARY for a tier released in December, and only after a series of serious adjustments.<br />
<br />
I'm willing to bet that if you take 10 of BL's best, or 10 of vodka's best or 10 of Method's best - they'd have faced a wall on Spiritbinder too. I'd really like to see how Paragon beat it.<br />

<br />
It's not like a ton of guilds have killed Garajal on 25 either. 15 total? Also, look at the guilds in the top for 25m. Exodus, Blood Legion, Vodka, Method, For The Horde, Envy. These are good guilds, it's not surprising the best of the top guilds still involved in 25man raiding (Paragon aside now) are doing well, is it?<br />
<br />
That said, the last paragraph I agree with. There are just mechanics that are more difficult with more people, like fire dodging, spreading out, or mechanics that rely on two people to do something. And not all 10 mans cover the same space, Hagara the polls were at the edge of the room in 25, and they used the inner circle for 10. Also there isn't as much fire in Blackhorn to soak, it's all proportional, or so Blizzard would have you believe.<br />
<br />
But DPS checks being lower for 10 is always a boon to the smaller raid teams. Those are the fights that are blockers for most guilds, since people are trying to do content in gear lower than intended when it comes to cutting edge raiding.</div></div><hr />

No spell steal or smoke bombs or anything you could consider exploit/clever use of game mechanics. We used three healers and killed him about 15 seconds before enrage. The kill was frapsed and the video will be out at some point.<br />

So much this. I don't care which is harder as it's impossible to tell anyway, and depends on so many factors. I think Paragon did an amazing job and it don't matter it's on 10 or 25. Kudos to them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I actually wrote a post on this a long time ago for something else. In 10 man, we got the same number of barrages as 25, the same debuff for soaking them, and they did the same amount of damage (I didn't believe that last bit until I researched it myself, I naturally thought 25s must take more damage from barrages, but they didn't). The difference was, you couldn't soak all of them in 10 man because you would stack your debuff too high because it would never fall off because you had less soakers. Thus, the meta turned out to be vastly different in 10 man. Afflic locks, boomkins, spriests, fire mages were practically required for progression kills on this fight because you HAD to burn the drakes before too many barrages went out - whereas on 25 the tank debuffs were more of a concern so melee adds got more attention, and the fight was more balanced.<br />
<br />
In Hagara, we had less totems, yes. But it was still impossible to chain all of them at once, as you had to use two ppl between each totem, unless you wanted to put healers in the mix and outrange people pretty badly. Also, consider how hard it was to get nature resist across that whole platform in 10 man. Consider what we had to do in our 10 man on H-Hagara progression, pre-nerf: We had to chain one whole chain just with pets (my hunter pet, our warlock pet) which meant intense pet micro to get them in the proper spots while we were in different spots. I had to cover my side of the platform with aspect of nature while our shaman had to drop nature resist on the other side (a totem in the middle wouldn't reach the people on the edges), and on the opposite side where we didn't have pets to chain, we had to have two high mobility classes on the first chain just so they could race over to chain the other totem (in our case, a rogue and a warrior using leap). Keep in mind, we had to 1 tank this fight, and have our resto druid swap to bear and taunt during assaults. In fact, a lot of progression fights in 10 man usually end up as 1 tank/2 heals, which is infinitely harder than what the stated design goals of 2 tanks/3 heals are (which only ends up as feasibly once people have been farming gear for awhile).<br />
<br />
H-Ultra is designed for 3 healers on 10 man - yet no progression guild in 10 man even contemplated using 3 heals. It would have been more impossible than the 25 enrage, during progression at least. With 2 heals, because the buffs were so OP with certain classes, the enrage on H10 Ultra seemed (and was) much easier than 25.<br />
<br />
H-Madness, during progression, mainly saw a mix of 1 tank fights with DPS cheesing an impale (vanish, feign, dispersion), or 1 1/2 tank fights with a cat soaking the first impale as bear and then DPSing the rest of the fight (Edit: or, 2 tanks with 2 heals). With 2 tanks and 3 heals, again, it would have been impossible. When was the last time a 25 man raid required their hunter to feign death an insta-gib boss mechanic in order to kill it to be competitive?</div></div><hr />

Well you obviously know jack shit about raiding if you think 10m's are harder. Went in, first week, first day, downed 4 bosses. Piss easy. Went back this week, currently on the second boss in 25m. 10m's are hard? Yeah fuckin right.<br />

<br />
Minor things like movement have a lot more impact on a 10man. <br />
<br />
For example, you get chains on first boss, you have 2 melee 3 ranged.<br />
Whenever a ranged or a healer get's linked to a melee he has to stay near the melee, the melee then again has to follow the boss around thus the ranged has to follow the melee.<br />
This lowers the healing/damage output of the linked ranged class.<br />
If you have 10man and all your 3 healers get linked to your melee you can do the math how much less healing output you'll have.<br />
The chance all 6 healers in a 25man get linked to melee is close to 0%. And this is just 1 example.</div></div><hr />

Considering that Blood Legion wiped (yes they all died) on the enrage timer and just managed to kill the boss in the same second while Paragon killed the boss 15, yes 15 seconds before enrage with three healers tells me the dps requirements once again is much steeper on 25 man. <br />
<br />
I just presented you the facts, now you can go ahead and make asumptions on which mode is harder.<br />
<br />
Personally I think that the other 10 man guilds are just that much worse than both the 25 man guilds but ofc also paragon. In the past there were no real good 10 man guild (despite 10 mans being easier). That is also a fact, do you remember noxa? the 25 man guild that came out of nowhere because they picked their 10 best players and destroyed all 10 man guilds but also most 25 man guilds.</div></div><hr />

In a 10 man, if the probability that each player will not fuck up and get themselves killed is 9/10 then 1-(9/10)^10 is the probability of at least one person dying (65%). for 25 man, its (92%) chance, but they get 3 battle resses, so the probability of AT LEAST 3 people dying is (7.01%). Clearly, 25 man is easier to recover from individual deaths. Now, if the ecnounter allows 1 person to kill everyone else in the raid by fucking up, then its the other way around, 25 is much harder.</div></div><hr />

agree, and its sad that so meny other 10man guild will take ream/world first from 25man guilds when all know 90% of the fights in 10man is so much easyer, just ppl dont put down the time as serius 25man guilds do.

Bosses in 25 are designed around coordinating more than twice as many raid cooldowns.<br />

Realy hope blizzard fix that there is a serverfirst 10man and 25man and you cant get both in on guild or somting becouse i still think there should be a race in 10man, but not against 25man or the other way around :)<br />
<br />
People in 25-man put in more time than 10-man? That is one weird assumption to draw imo. And I would also know where you got your statistics from saying that 90% of all fights are easier on 10-man, even using &quot;so much easier&quot;. You clearly have never raided serious in your life, but you love to have opinions about it. <br />
Give them cred, they are the best and people are just jealous a-holes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anyway, i think that the &quot;true&quot; raiding way is 25 man - it's only a personal opinion, 10man feels like a slightly bigger heroic istance.<br />
<br />
Also lol @ raid composition.</div></div><hr />

10 man raiding is harder than 25. Not much harder but there is a gap.<br />
A players mistake can be forgiven in a 25 man but not in a 10 man. A player under performing in a 25 man is not making a great difference but in a 10 man makes a big one. <br />
On the other hand, it is much easier to find 10 great players than 25. And these 10 Paragon players are making a Dream team...</div></div><hr />

Considering second place is 2/6...yes. The percentage of 10 man guild that have killed a heroic boss is so significantly lower then 25.</div></div><hr />

<br />
25man has way more possibilities/opportunities to make mistakes.<br />
I always found 10man more easy since coordination is so easy and mechanics are less complex. I found 25 more easy during majority of T11. In T12 I found 25 harder. In T13, it was different, both difficulties had their easy and hard fights. And fights with mechanics like seeds at rag or defile, always are harder on 25 since there are 15ppl extra that can cause the raid to wipe. Fight with 1 person makes a mistake -&gt; wipe always are harder in 25. But ye if the mistakes don't lead to a wipe, then 25 is easier.<br />
<br />
But anyway, we still have to see 25man world first, I think it are 2 different leagues.<br />
<br />
Gratz to Paragon for their 10man world first. <br />
<br />
And blizz did again a poor job on class balance when i look at the comp. Srsly nerf multidotting</div></div><hr />

Anyways they were the best at 25 man (Would of cleared DS 1st if it wasn't for the LFR exploit ban) and have been since ICC. Now they the best at 10man and have been since ICC :)<br />

Except there isn't 4 druids on the kill, if you look at the screenshot, one of the balance druids is playing a rogue. There's a guardian druid, a balance druid and a resto druid, one of each.<br />

<br />
It's harder to find people for 25man obviously, but that doesn't say anything which of the 2 is actually harder to do.<br />
At that level of play i am sure it's both very hard.<br />
For the less hardcore, the 10 man is less forgiving in general.</div></div><hr />

Of course 25 man guilds didn't do something like that ether. They didn't clear first few bosses twice on launch day because instances were reset after realm was up. And of course they ran only one raid full of their mains instead of running several raids to get max gear for their mains. Right?<br />
<br />
Don't be silly. All top guilds made everything possible to get best possible gear for their main team.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In 25s you can afford to have a few deaths and you can even pull if you're backfilling a few players. Both really make you stop in your tracks on 10s. In 25, it's easier to fade back into the group if you're still not 100% confident in what you're doing. In 10s, it's harder to be a wallflower.<br />

Grats DREAM Paragon for tackling the newest content in the hardest mode (10 man.) I look forward to more world firsts from you!</div></div><hr />

It's the World First 10man kill. How do you not understand that? There are two sizes, 25man and 10man, and this was the world first 10man.</div></div><hr />

There is so much rage and ignorance in this statement that makes it laughable at best. You obviously know absolutely NOTHING about raiding. There is NO difference between 10 and 25 other than it is balanced slightly different to accommodate and justify the presence of 25 people. Blizzard has CONFIRMED there is no vast difference in terms of difficulty in wrath and from there on. Get over yourself and stop trying to make others feel bad. Besides, if you have such a high and mighty opinion about it then where is your heroic achievement for clearing it since its so easy? Let me guess, you are going to say you don't play anymore. Why post about it then? It doesn't affect you. The first kill of a boss, regardless of 10 or 25, is the FIRST. End of story. There is no room to debate its validity just because of the amount of people present.</div></div><hr />
