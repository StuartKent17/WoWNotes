Vanessa VanCleef<br />
<br />
Some boat fires will now go out when Vanessa VanCleef is defeated, making it easier to get back onto the ship from the cavern entrance.<br />
Vengeance of VanCleef has been redesigned. It is now a stacking buff that increases damage dealt, size, and attack speed, and stacks up to 40 times. Vanessa will begin casting this as soon as she jumps back onto the boat after detonating charges.<br />

Scourge Strike / Dreadblade<br />
The Shadow portion of Scourge Strike is intended to be affected by Dreadblade (this was part of the intent behind changing Unholy mastery); however, there's a bug on the PTR right now that's preventing this from happening correctly. It should be resolved soon, or may already be resolved in the next PTR build. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/152630/scourge-strike-not-affected-by-dreadblade))<br />

Racial Flight Forms<br />
Worgen and trolls should both be getting new Swift Flight Form models this patch, even if that's not the case on the current PTR build. We have no current plans to update the models of the tauren and night elf Swift Flight Form model. The reason trolls and worgen are getting new models is because they're new to the druid class and have not yet received their own.

Hammer of Wrath damage &quot;nerfed&quot; by 50% on PTRs<br />
This is actually a bug. A very non-excessive, non-stealthy bug. There was small coding change in the latest PTR build that caused Hammer of Wrath, a ranged ability, to use ranged attack power instead of melee attack power. The change itself was completely unintended and has since been corrected.<br />
<br />
That said, we're still watching paladin damage (both sustained and burst), and if we feel that further adjustments need to be made, Hammer of Wrath may actually be a good candidate.<br />
<br />
[...] There's no changes planned right now, but Hammer of Wrath does hit for a lot and would be an ability we'd likely look at changing if we felt that paladin damage was too strong. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/152570/50-hammer-of-wrath-nerf-going-live))<br />
<br />
Class Balancing<br />
That's not really how it works. Balance is an ongoing, iterative process, and we continually examine how class abilities interact and scale with one another. Even when we're not actively developing a patch, we don't just sit around with our hands over our eyes and wait for something to happen. We consider alternatives and monitor areas of balance we feel may need further finessing if things don't stay at the status quo.<br />
<br />
So, simply because we have an idea for how we might be able to tone down paladin damage in the future -- if it becomes necessary -- that doesn't mean change is imminent. It also doesn't mean that we've made some fancy list with little empty checkboxes on one side and paladin abilities on the other and are now sitting perched with a big red pen in our hand, just waiting to draw an X through the one labeled &quot;Hammer of Wrath.&quot; No, all it means is that we feel Hammer of Wrath may be a reasonable candidate for adjustment should we need to reexamine paladin DPS sometime down the line. Your fellow posters have offered counters as to why that may not be best approach, of course, and we absolutely appreciate the feedback.

Circle of Healing Radius (PS: This one's totally my fault)<br />
This information is actually incorrect. In addition to Circle of Healing receiving a 30% healing buff, its radius (around the target) is also being increased from 15 yards to 30 yards in patch 4.0.6. If this change isn't already live on the PTR, it should be soon, so you and fellow priests will be able to test out new positioning and see how it feels.

Build 13529 Warrior Changes (Please read Bad Datamining (http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/835145-Bad-Datamining) about that) <br />
Heroic Strike was never 93% damage. That was just bad data-mining. You can't always trust the automated tools of third-party websites to correctly extract and organize all of the client data being sorted through. This type of misleading information has come out several times now over the course of testing patches 4.0.3 and 4.0.6, so it's a really good idea for players to be suspicious of data-mined material.<br />
<br />
We brought down Heroic Strike to 60% (20% decrease in overall damage from live realms), and it has stayed at 60% throughout 4.0.6 development.<br />
<br />
We did buff Raging Blow (and some other stuff) to compensate for the Heroic Strike nerf, since the intent was to make Heroic Strike a clear rage dump and not to lower warrior damage. We were concerned our initial buff of Raging Blow was too high, leading to possible (but realistically pretty unlikely) burst scenarios, so we took it down a little (but still higher than on live realms), and buffed Slam instead to make the Bloodsurge proc something you actually want to take advantage of.

Holiday Dessert Contest Winners<br />
Another holiday season has come and gone, and while parting may be bittersweet, the entries you baked up and photographed for the 2010 Blizzard Holiday Dessert Contest were all sweet, all the time. This contest was a community favorite last year, so we once again asked you to bake a dessert with a distinctly Blizzard flavor and snap a photo to share the joy (if not the taste). We were amazed by the deliriously delicious delights and tantalizing treats you tempted us with!<br />
<br />
After reviewing all of the entries, we came away more than a little hungry (send cupcakes, pls), but we were finally able to get over our grumbling tummies to select these truly mouthwatering winners. Feast your eyes on these five fantastic finalists, and please join us in congratulating them on their leet baking skills!<br />

amg @ Piercing Howl Nerf :(. Was quite useful for certain pve encounters (heroics, etc.) when the ranged were nabish. And really helped with peeling/Bladestorming in PvP.<br />
Mortal Strike buff is quite cool though :), will add a net PvE dps increase for arms (allowing for quicker MS usage if/when rage starved and allowing for more Slam/HS usage otherwise).</div></div><hr />

As much as you may believe how it easy it is to balance. It is not that easy. Not for both PvP and PvE with 3 specs in mind and some class &quot;lore&quot; mechanics in place. The only complain I have is that Blizzard is not adjusting things fast enough. But I am not expecting them to actually balance stuff for good, becouse that is close to impossible.</div></div><hr />

It might not be easy to achieve 100% balance, but they aren´t even close. Some classes are useless in PvP and others bordering on OP.. How hard is it to give classes the same amount of silences, interupts and stuns?

Pretty hard apparently. I mean look at the disparity between interrupts. Skull Bash (feral) has (talented) a 10s CD... while my mage's is 24 on Counterspell. That doesn't even count all the other ones. But to be honest I wouldn't want their job. So many different possible ways you can totally screw up the balance between classes. A mere 5% variance up or down can result in your class becoming the most hated OP class ever (think early LK DKs) or the worse class/spec since lolret from TBC or getting sunwell'd for half the expansion.</div></div><hr />

And how quickly would everyone scream &quot;OMG! Homogenization! Everyone is the same! Ack!&quot; if they do do that? Not to mention it's not an effective way to balance. Every class does different amounts of damage, how will you account for that? Plate wearers take less damage from physical attacks, is that fair? Hunters and Melee are unaffected by silences. You could give a Mage a million silences and he couldn't stop a Rogue. Give him four roots and that same rogue is in much more serious trouble. Similarly you can root a caster all day and not really accomplish much, but a few silences will make his life pretty hard for a while. What about breaks for CC or stuns? Do they all have to be the same too? <br />
<br />
In short, your solution is blatantly over simplistic, would piss people off, and would accomplish nothing to increase balance. I suppose the reason you're able to make makes fun of GC's Marine Biology degree is because you're actually the lead designer for a much better and more balanced player vs player game? If so, let me know which one so I can avoid playing it.</div></div><hr />

On reflection, a third question:<br />
Where is the Horde hunting party that kills all the NPCs and trolls level 6 humans from the rooftop?</div></div><hr />

Homogenization! Everyone is the same! Ack!&quot; if they do do that? Not to mention it's not an effective way to balance. Every class does different amounts of damage, how will you account for that? Plate wearers take less damage from physical attacks, is that fair? Hunters and Melee are unaffected by silences. You could give a Mage a million silences and he couldn't stop a Rogue. Give him four roots and that same rogue is in much more serious trouble. Similarly you can root a caster all day and not really accomplish much, but a few silences will make his life pretty hard for a while. What about breaks for CC or stuns? Do they all have to be the same too? <br />
<br />
In short, your solution is blatantly over simplistic, would piss people off, and would accomplish nothing to increase balance. I suppose the reason you're able to make makes fun of GC's Marine Biology degree is because you're actually the lead designer for a much better and more balanced player vs player game? If so, let me know which one so I can avoid playing it.<br />
<br />
The example wasn´t literal you douche. It was merely an illustration of 1 place the game is way out of whack. Some classes have their silences/interupts whatever on 1 min CD while others have 14sec, it doesn´t take a genius to see that. Had you read my previous post you might have discovered that i´m not asking for 100% balance nor homogenization of classes, merely pointing out that they are so far from balance that it´s not even funny.<br />
<br />
And yes, I happen to know a bit about development and QA/testing. Now if you can´t see that some of the stuff that actually makes it to live should have been caught already in development, well that´s your problem not mine. But way to be a smartass about it.<br />
<br />
And I wasn´t making fun of him being a marine biologist, wich is awesome. I was making the point that having someone who doesn´t know a line of code as lead systems designer on the worlds biggest MMO is foolish considering he was making drawings on the first game he was hired for, comprende or should I draw you a schematic. Reading comprehension can be hard when nerdraging eh.</div></div><hr />

realy fun playing, yeah? so interesting.<br />
<br />
and what about that Inner Rage? is this a spell or a talent? can't undarstand. it's not even a passive bonus. what is that? becouse, it's suck. realy. the most silly ability from all classes 80+. oh, wait. this is not an ability...<br />
not enough of fantasy to create new normal useful ability? can't you make something new for class? quite the company! you are useless then.<br />
<br />
is that so hard not to drunk or not to smoke while creating balance and testing PTRs or what?<br />
and not to listen little pussy kids-whiners-mages-gnomes/goblins?<br />
just quite half of all your teams - this is the question, guys.<br />

<br />
What are you expecting. A finished product? This isn't a single player game that you can expect to be in somewhat finished state when you buy it. <br />
<br />
MMOs are always in development, there is always new content incoming and new bugs that need to be fixed. Of course you're always a beta tester, this product is never really finished.</div></div><hr />

Some classes are useless in PvP and others bordering on OP.. How hard is it to give classes the same amount of silences, interupts and stuns? Devs will have you believe it is hard as shit, but with a marine biologist as lead systems designer it´s no wonder really. Bottom of the barrel devs work for Blizz and on wow it seems.<br />
<br />
Ghostcrawler, really I do. I used to live in Austin. But um, marine biologist... yeah. Mebbe he has slept with the fishies oncest too often. Classes are so far from balanced it's crazy. Fire frost arcane are nowhere near each other, feral does shit dmg compared to balance, ret does no dmg, Surv is the only viable hunter, shamans seem to be missing 4-6 spells... The list goes on and on. And not a fix in sight, rather talk about nerfs. Le sigh.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I try and comprehend your post, and Bantokars many posts, I really do.<br />
<br />
But I all I see is a bunch of QQ, to put it bluntly. Sure, this game is not completely balanced in PvP, but it's not that balanced in PvE either.<br />
<br />
Let's review the facts here a little bit.<br />
<br />
We have 10 classes, 4 of which have 3 damage dealing specs (4x3=12); 4 of which have 2 damage dealing specs (4x2=8) and 2 that have one (dedicated) damage dealing spec (2x1=2). Right there, we're talking 22 different specs, all that - in your eyes - needs to be balanced so that they can be equally competitive, whilst still staying unique enough to be different. <br />
<br />
Still seems like an easy task? <br />
<br />
Let's throw in the fact that these classes also need to be balanced in PvE. A minor buff to a class in PvP may very well lead to a major buff in PvE, which also throws off the balance. <br />
<br />
So, to balance 22 different specs, in a way that doesn't make the spec worse than other specs, but still not too powerful, and at the SAME TIME staying relatively balanced in PvE, isn't so hard? Do you really think that?</div></div><hr />
