This could mean that this is a 2.2 feature, but it's still unsure because in a previous blue post (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=965654657&amp;pageNo=1&amp;sid=1#5) Nethaera stated that it wouldn't be in this patch. <br />

2.2 Item changes<br />
Update : All screenshots are now updated with 2.2 PTR / 2.1 Live comparison. <br />
<br />
Yesterday, some items were changed during the PTR Patch. I'd say that my list is pretty much complete now. (I'll add a screenshot of the Serpentshrine Shuriken and probably try to get a better version of enchantments when PTRs are back up)<br />
<br />
New paladin shield (http://www.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2007/august/illidariruneshield.jpg). (Ilvl 141, could drop from pretty much anything in Hyjal or Black Temple, technically it could also drop from Vashj or Kael'Thas now that the ilvl of their loot is 141, but it's doubtful)<br />
All the weapons from Serpentshrine Cavern (http://www.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2007/august/sscchanges2.jpg) were upgraded (Including Wildfury Greatstaff (http://www.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2007/august/wildfurychanges.jpg) and Serpentshrine Shuriken (http://www.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2007/august/serpentshrineshuriken2.jpg) from trash).<br />
All the weapons from Tempest Keep (http://www.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2007/august/tkchanges2.jpg) were upgraded. <br />
The amount of reagents needed for several enchantments (http://www.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2007/august/enchantchanges3.jpg) has been lowered.<br />
[item=21756] cooldown has been changed from 30 minutes to 20 minutes.<br />
[item=23565] attack power bonus has been changed from 58 to 84<br />
[item=23576] required level has been changed from 55 to 60<br />
[item=30067], [item=32540], and [item=32541] now requires 300 in enchantment skill to be disenchanted. <br />

Tigole interview on Mondespersistants.com<br />
Mondespersistants.com (http://wow.mondespersistants.com/?article=403&amp;page_art=2), a french fansite, has interviewed Tigole and Chris Robinson during the Games Convention, the video and the transcript (in both english and french) is now available here (http://wow.mondespersistants.com/?article=403&amp;page_art=2).<br />
<br />
As usual here is a short summary :<br />
Arthas will &quot;use&quot; both alliance and horde players to defeat things that cannot be defeated by his brainless minions, the same way the Lich King used Arthas in the first place.<br />
Death Knight will probably be able to use and inscribe any weapon with runes. (Even if they might add a few Death Knight specific weapons)<br />
Few things about instance we already know, Azjol'Nerub will be a mega-huge underground zone full of spiders, the Nexus will have 3 instances and you will fight Malygos in the last one (lvl 80, 25 players).<br />
They might change old battlegrounds like AV, but they're still not sure if they will be able to do it because of the heavy changes it implies. <br />
Mal'ganis (http://www.wowwiki.com/Mal'Ganis) will be the final boss of CoT : Stratholme.<br />
Sunwell Plateau will have 6 bosses in the 25 man raid dungeon, and a 5 people normal and heroic instance. <br />
A &quot;famous character&quot; is trying to re-ignite the sunwell and summons Kil'jaeden back. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Wrath of the Lich King<br />
Rise of the Lich King (Chapter 3) (http://www.wow-europe.com/wrath/features.xml) is now available on the official website. <br />

Blizzard BETTER make Malygos' dragon graphic different that ANY dragon out there and, he being an aspect and all, he has to be MASSIVE.

YOU'VE SEEN NOZDORMU????<br />
Anyways. The aspects imo should've never been involved in this game 'cause with all that glory and brilliance even the fact that I'll see one (and I'll kill 'em too) feels somewhat awkward. These guys are what fantasy dragons are aiming for.<br />
I mean look at Neltharion...<br />
http://www.wowwiki.com/images/c/c7/Neltharion.jpg<br />
Veins of molten lava, skin of earth's most valuable minerals fused with adamant... my god...<br />
<br />
Alexstrasza, now this is a good example of how big they should be, imagine Nefarian standing next to her knee...<br />
http://www.wowwiki.com/images/b/bf/Alexstrasza.PNG<br />

My personal fav aspect Nozdormu. Beauty in motion<br />

I'm guessing that it was late and stuff.. and the dragon you think was Nozdormu, might just be Anachronos, Zaladormu or maybe one of the 4 known drakes in WoW? ;) <br />
<br />
... and as overneathe said, fighting the aspects and meet them as (most likely) Reskinned/Coloured standard Dragons would be an awfull way of screwing with the mighty aspects!<br />

<br />
<br />
I hope thats not what Blizzard does and i think we have a good 70% chance that they will do the Aspects right, although this does clash with what i thought a future expansion might consist of, i had hoped Blizzard would have saved the Aspects for an expansion of their own something like:<br />
<br />
World of Warcraft: Glory of the Dragon Aspects<br />
<br />
or something of that nature. <br />
<br />
Also, i am a bit disappointed with the current, dragon broods. For example, Ysera's brood are supposed to be always shifting in and out of the Emerald Dream, yet the ones we see dont really do that, unless those are not directly of x aspect's brood. That kind of killed it for me when i first seen the bronze dragons, because i think the way they 'move' is they look like they are frozen in time, but as you move your eyes/blink you can 'see' them move...something along that nature.<br />
<br />
Also, they just HAVE to do the Aspects right, and give them unique skins and colors as the 5 Aspects are very unique:<br />
<br />
Alexstrasza: ENORMOUS, MASSIVE dragon, the biggest dragon of the current aspects, thus the biggest dragon in all of Azeroth.<br />
<br />
Ysera: Green Dragon, probably medium size in comparison to Alexstrasza. Her eyes are ALWAYS closed and has only opened them 2 times. Her and her brood both seem to always be 'shifting' in and out of the Emerald Dream.<br />
<br />
Nozdormu: Another Massive and Enormous dragon. Golden Bronze in color. Him and his flight appear as to be frozen in time but as you blin/look around they do appear to 'move'<br />
<br />
Malygos: Azure Dragon, and i think the &quot;smallest&quot; of the aspects, was very merry but INCREDIBLY powerful with the use of magic, more than makes up for his size. Him and his broods' scales shift from Azure Blue to Pure silver as they move around.<br />
<br />
Netharion(Deathwing): As big as Alexstrasza, Deathwing has changed from his Onyx black form into his current mishapen form of Adamantite plates melded with his Onyx skin, with molten lava 'cracks' around his hide.<br />
<br />
Also, all these dragons are MASSIVE, i really hope they are represented correctly as the only reason i continue playing is that blizzard has done a pretty damn good job of keeping with their lore, so heres hoping..</div></div><hr />

I wouldn't keep your hopes up, Nozdormu doesn't look like his art at all. Just another differently colored dragon..<br />
<br />
<br />
I dont know where you think you have seen him, but he is not the dragon in the center of the Caverns of Time. I believe this was clarified by a hunter using Track Dragonkin and it revealed the name of the non-targetable dragon in there, and it was not Nozdormu.<br />
<br />
I dont quite recall if any of the aspects were directly visable in the AQ opening however...(unlikely)<br />
<br />
However I agree with other posters, they had best rehash the typical Dragonkin models, atleast the ones in Northrend, it was bad enough with the Inf Dragonflight, having the typical models with a boreing blue... and a lightning pattern on them will do -nothing-.<br />
<br />
Malygos being within 'The Rift' seems to have some quite 'unreal' options available to it, and as a result could hold his massive aspect size quite well, he had damned well better be bigger than Onyxia, and not a rehash of Taerar or that his flight will have the Taerar effect on the normal models to make them 'different'.<br />
<br />
Its going to be bad enough having the same old ghouls... fiends... abominations all over the place, however atleast these are fitting how they should be.<br />
<br />
Their lame excuses for having every single unit being rehashed skins of old models (and poorly recoloured too), and having all their tier set graphics completly abused by almost every single non-set item and PvP item that exists is horrible and they had best move away from that theme in WotLK, the cost of 1 more graphic designer is minimal and its one very needed change.</div></div><hr />

If blizzard does that to Malygos, meaning that if they use &quot; well-he-is-in-a-rift-which-warps-reality-and-makes-him-appear-like-any-other-dragon-in-this-game-along-with-his-flight&quot; i can officially say i would be done with WoW.

I can excuse the whole Dranei/Eredar thing, as i think they handled that pretty well, but i cannot and will not excuse a watering down of Malygos and his broods. Aspects are suppposed to look great and inspire awe who see them, so again..heres hoping they do Malygos and his brood right...hell he's already been through hell.<br />
<br />
And also any future aspects and broods :)</div></div><hr />

Their art department needs a serious overhaul given their creative draught. :-\</div></div><hr />
