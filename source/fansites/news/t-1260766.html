<br />
Yup, because it's true. You say that 9.6 million is a game dying.. What does that say for every other mmo out there? Already dead? Or is it purely on how fast you're going down not total numbers? Or are you just scewing things so you have an arguement? Hmm?</div></div><hr />

Doesn't really matter, it's a huge loss of many of those are in Europe/US and will mean a whole less money for them. Grinding Dailys and stuff all day doesn't seem to have been that liked afterall, so people were right that the whole double rep for factions and other things were a saving throw by Blizzard.</div></div><hr />

You are putting a positive spin on a huge loss.<br />
<br />
How many people do you think play in the U.S. and Europe? 2+ million respectively? Losing 1/4 of your market in one of those places is not something that you can just ignore.</div></div><hr />

Declining numbers is a game &quot;dying&quot; how long it takes is anyone's guess at this point.<br />

Every mmo is in decline. People quit and come back.. WoWs numbers are only bigger because they can be. If you only have 250k playing, losing 25k is around the same amount. You say WoW's golden age is over.. based upon what? At least it had a golden age.<br />

Also, i quit months ago so don't try throwing that fanboy crap at me.</div></div><hr />

So What?&quot; crowd is implying is this. In the grand scheme of things the loss of 500,000 subscribers will in no meaningful way impact the current game. Servers will not be merging. Subscription fees will not be decreasing (or increasing). Expansions and content will not be churned out at a greater pace, nor will micro-transactions burst into being at a greater pace than they already have been.<br />
<br />
Subscription-based services are rarely as stable as one might dream. But we're talking of a drop from 10,000,000+ to 9,600,000. That's not even 1/10th of the subscription base. That's not even 1% of the subscription base. It's not even outside the realm of acceptable subscription losses given past quarterly earning reports and the general ebb and flow of World of Warcraft subscriptions.<br />
<br />
Every time an expansion launches subscriptions soar. Then subscriptions dwindle down until a major content patch. Then they go back up again. Then as we wait on the next patch they taper down. So forth, so on. One day WoW will fade away into nothingness, but a 500,000 subscription loss isn't going to hasten it into an early grave.</div></div><hr />

they made over a billion dollars in profit. thats the positive spin. subscribers mean nothing as long as the game is profitable</div></div><hr />

When has any other MMO held even a million for more then a month launch? (Excluding GW2 as everyone who ever bought the game is an &quot;active subscriber&quot; even if they havent played since launch)</div></div><hr />

I hope you realize, that if that 500k is from U.S or Europe, that is a huge deal. I assume 4-7 mill players alone are from outside those 2 continents.<br />
<br />
I expect more subscriber decrease in the coming months. 500k was just the beginning. I don't get why people still playing this old game. No matter what blizzard puts in, an old game, will always remain an old game.</div></div><hr />

At least it had a golden age.Based upon the fact that the game hasn't been at it's peak number of players since 2010?<br />
<br />
It's been losing players since Q1 2011, even MOP which is a great expansion couldn't stop the sub loss.</div></div><hr />

But Diablo isn't doing well, just because it sold a lot of copies based on the name of the game doesn't mean it was actually any good there is a lot of statistics that show the numbers playing has drastically decreased since release because it just isn't very good.</div></div><hr />

How many people do you think play in the U.S. and Europe? 2+ million respectively? Losing 1/4 of your market in one of those places is not something that you can just ignore.<br />
<br />
Yes pretend all the losses are in na/eu <br />
<br />
I honestly think its the theme of MoP. If it had been a legion expansion with everything 100% the same wed be at 11m atm. MoP while good was the wrong xpac to have after Cataclysm. It will be interesting to see if they can come back from this.</div></div><hr />

No it doesn't. In fact it's likely that a majority of them weren't from Europe/US as most of the big losses in the past were from the east. I don't see an indication one way or another from this release but to say that it &quot;has to be from Europe/US&quot; is ignorant.</div></div><hr />

We might find out soon. The first large drops was noted to be coming from Europe/US and later quarterly reports stated a larger portion coming from Asia as Blizzard further reduced the already gutted grind in Cata. Europe/US tend to not enjoy grinds and time investment as much as their Asian counterparts. It is not entirely ignorant to think that the larger losses are from Europe/US.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So? Just because 500k is more than most other mmo's have in active players doesn't change the fact that it's a huge loss. And a huge loss just means a huge loss, not that the game is dying or whatever, but I guess you're just a fanboy who doesn't like it when someone doesn't praise the game to a next level.<br />
<br />
Just think about it, 500k may be more than most other mmo's have but it's still about 5% of all subscribers. And please don't forget that it's still a loss of about 7,5 million Dollar or 6,5 Euro I think, per month ofcourse. So I don't know bout you but I think that, even for a company as Blizzard, that really is huge.</div></div><hr />

12 Million players? Where are you getting this from, WoW never had 12 million active players, but rather subscriptions. Not to be a douche but subscriptions does not equal players.</div></div><hr />

You don't have any common sense. That's why I call you a fanboy. Because you're too blinded to see what's so obvious with a little thought put into it.<br />

Cata lost subs because of a lack of content. That's logical and expected to happen in any game. Guess what just happened? Sub loss WITH content. What do you think that means? That means they are in deep shit, because even if they pump out content on a regular basis, people are giving less of a fuck more and more. <br />
<br />
This is so obvious to see but apparently you can't wrap your head around it.</div></div><hr />

Players have already made up their mind and regardless of what the numbers are, they will use it justify their stance. Loss of 500k: &quot;OMG abandon ship!!.&quot; If it had been a gain it would have been: &quot;OMG the bots are overtaking us, abandon ship!!&quot; What I'm saying is that the numbers are useless for a community that has already made its mind up one way or another. <br />
<br />
I have largely enjoyed MoP so far once I began playing again. What I have not understood is Blizzard's decisions. If they had the most subscribers during Wrath, why deviate from that model of content? Sure some attrition is to be expected as time goes on, but heavily revamping major parts of the game (talents and whatnot) between every expansion has to account for some of the fluctuation in numbers. Why would you fix what the numbers told you wasn't broken?</div></div><hr />

I've never actually been bothered about subscription numbers as I don't care. I just find it silly to look at. But saying &quot; WoW they lost 500k so what &quot;That takes the cake. That is 500 000 players that quit playing. Giving that 1,5 months, which is half a quarter year. I'd say 1 million is more to the reality. That's just showing that many people are leaving due to how the game is going.<br />
<br />
Now don't get me wrong, you like the game, play it and don't bother about other players. But there is from 500 000 - 1 000 000 players that left the game because they're not enjoying the game anymore, or that the game is going in the wrong direction. You might not care, but those 500 k - 1 m do care.</div></div><hr />

the game was never going to live forever. and its finally reaching a point where its starting to get &quot;old&quot; (in both gameplay and tech, 8 years is a long time to be playing ANY game with regularity). it will probably lose numbers bit by bit from here on out. but ill start worrying about a lack of support on blizzards end when the game actually reaches numbers that aren't still largely unprecedented. in other words. lets save this inevitable &quot;doomsday&quot; conversation for another 3-4 years.</div></div><hr />

<br />
How many people do you think play in the U.S. and Europe? 2+ million respectively? Losing 1/4 of your market in one of those places is not something that you can just ignore.<br />
<br />
I don't argue that this is a downturn in the size of the player base but did all 500k leave from US &amp; Europe? They didn't lose 1/4 of their market in either of those regions. Those 500k came from the 10,000,000 players around the globe. They lost 1/20th of their player base, not 1/4. Is it declining? I don't think so personally but everyone is welcome to their own opinion.</div></div><hr />

Just because 500k is more than most other mmo's have in active players doesn't change the fact that it's a huge loss. And a huge loss just means a huge loss, not that the game is dying or whatever, but I guess you're just a fanboy who doesn't like it when someone doesn't praise the game to a next level.<br />
<br />
Just think about it, 500k may be more than most other mmo's have but it's still about 5% of all subscribers. And please don't forget that it's still a loss of about 7,5 million Dollar or 6,5 Euro I think, per month ofcourse. So I don't know bout you but I think that, even for a company as Blizzard, that really is huge.<br />
<br />
Except the game losing players doesn't have a direct effect on me, yet. Sometimes I think people jump ship because there is a perception that the game is bleeding rather than asking the question &quot;Am I still having fun?&quot;</div></div><hr />

I think its kinda equal parts sad, equal parts pathetic that some of you guys all but celebrate WoW (or some other game that's 'cool' to hate on) losing subs. Maybe you're bitter players of failed competitors like TOR, or maybe you're just the kind of selfish people who love hearing about a successful person losing some of their money on the stock market. <br />
<br />
I mean, imagine being in college and having family or friends all just hawking you and waiting for the moment you fail, making forum posts about how terrible they expect your grades to be/etc. That's some of you guys. <br />

Everything that gave World of Warcraft that special 'online world' feel and that really harnessed the potential of closely formed online communities has been brushed aside in the name consumerism and convenience. A realm community used to be an awesome social group, you knew a load of people and a load of people knew and recognised you. You'd log on not for the daily grind but just to play with your online buddies. Now people barely know each other unless they go out of their way, and you just get randomly assigned to a random group with random people and that is supposed to simulate the enjoyment and comradeship of yesteryear. Well I'm sorry Blizzard - but it doesn't even come close. I for one see no reason to pay a subscription when I can just buy an offline RPG which is just as good and doesn't try to pretend to be massively multiplayer.</div></div><hr />

They should not count the chinese who do not have subscription models like everyone else. If a chinese plays 1 hour in a year, and pays $0.01 to do so to blizzard, that hardly counts as a subscription.<br />

I wish they would stop trying to mislead the market and tell us how many europe and north american subscriptions they have, because that is what should be compared to other MMOs.

The NA region has ~230 servers. It could easily be reduced to 90, and should. A lot of people should play WoW, but they're spread out to when the game was at its peak of its popularity in Wrath and they needed to spread players to lighten server load in ICC.

So What?&quot; crowd is implying is this. In the grand scheme of things the loss of 500,000 subscribers will in no meaningful way impact the current game. Servers will not be merging. Subscription fees will not be decreasing (or increasing). Expansions and content will not be churned out at a greater pace, nor will micro-transactions burst into being at a greater pace than they already have been.<br />
<br />
Subscription-based services are rarely as stable as one might dream. But we're talking of a drop from 10,000,000+ to 9,600,000. That's not even 1/10th of the subscription base. That's not even 1% of the subscription base. It's not even outside the realm of acceptable subscription losses given past quarterly earning reports and the general ebb and flow of World of Warcraft subscriptions.<br />
<br />
Every time an expansion launches subscriptions soar. Then subscriptions dwindle down until a major content patch. Then they go back up again. Then as we wait on the next patch they taper down. So forth, so on. One day WoW will fade away into nothingness, but a 500,000 subscription loss isn't going to hasten it into an early grave.<br />

This might be the best explanation on this subject yet.<br />

And I still love high level raiding, but I don't feel like I can focus on that and be fair to teammates if I just skip all the dailies, etc. The 5.2 changes aren't nearly aggressive enough. If the problems they were trying to address were people not having enough to do, give us more to do (pet battles and challenge modes being a wonderful example here).

<br />
They should not count the chinese who do not have subscription models like everyone else. If a chinese plays 1 hour in a year, and pays $0.01 to do so to blizzard, that hardly counts as a subscription.<br />
<br />
I wish they would stop trying to mislead the market and tell us how many europe and north american subscriptions they have, because that is what should be compared to other MMOs. Dont get me wrong, I love WoW, but it does not need more credit then it deserves, it already hogs the spot light almost entirely.<br />
<br />
I agree.<br />
<br />
Why does no one ask Blizzard what actually constitutes a subscription? They seem to be pretty open to questions these days.</div></div><hr />

The issue is not the amount of people leaving, but the brand new people buying and playing the game. If those numbers drop it's because WOW does not attract enough new players to maintain the player base and allow it to renew itself or grow.<br />
<br />
It's totally normal to see people leave the game. Problem is, not enough new people joining it versus people leaving. So the emphasis should be on how to attrack NEW players.<br />
<br />
Returning players are not really your goal there, because they are bound to leave again.<br />
<br />
How many people you know in WOW that have just started player this game? I know I don't know any. And apparently the community is attrocious against those players because they tell them to learn to play, etc, and obviously don't remember how they were when they joined the game.<br />

But hey... I left cause of the new and poorly thought RPG systems in MOP - I can understand others that do the same. And 5.2 is just making it worse with extra ilvls for lower chance. No way I will return while thats how BLizzard think they will solve issues. Not realising that it will cause so many extra problems in guilds cause of loot greed. <br />
<br />
But they need to get 5.2 out before end of March. If not we will see more than 1 million subs loss in 1st Quarter 2013. That will take the game down to new lows - and new games are coming.</div></div><hr />

So What?&quot; crowd is implying is this. In the grand scheme of things the loss of 500,000 subscribers will in no meaningful way impact the current game. Servers will not be merging. Subscription fees will not be decreasing (or increasing). Expansions and content will not be churned out at a greater pace, nor will micro-transactions burst into being at a greater pace than they already have been.<br />
<br />
Subscription-based services are rarely as stable as one might dream. But we're talking of a drop from 10,000,000+ to 9,600,000. That's not even 1/10th of the subscription base. That's not even 1% of the subscription base. It's not even outside the realm of acceptable subscription losses given past quarterly earning reports and the general ebb and flow of World of Warcraft subscriptions.<br />
<br />
Every time an expansion launches subscriptions soar. Then subscriptions dwindle down until a major content patch. Then they go back up again. Then as we wait on the next patch they taper down. So forth, so on. One day WoW will fade away into nothingness, but a 500,000 subscription loss isn't going to hasten it into an early grave.<br />

Reading your other posts in this news post, get the fuck out if you're so biased. 5 years ago would be during Burning Crusade. Everyone who has left wow during MoP didn't start in wotlk or cata, lots of vanilla and BC players have taken their leave too, you know.<br />

I am honestly going to laugh at this idea. I'll admit to being a Cata baby-but I'm not going anywhere either. Not all new players are bad or mind a bit of a grind to this game. This idea that new players = bad is a bit insulting imo. I know quite a few people (myself included) that have ranked in WoL in the top 50 on current encounters and they have been playing the game for less than 2 years.

That said, 9.6 million is likely a statistically significant drop from &quot;over 10 million.&quot; Anything amounting to a drop of ~5% will raise investors' eyebrows.<br />
<br />
What will really raise eyebrows is that this includes MOP launch in China. WOW has been carried by China (over 60% of playerbase). So this is really more of a shock for me since I was sure we would be seeing an Asian look WOW increase the player numbers. I think the dmg in EU and US is much bigger than what BLizz makes it look like.<br />
<br />
Sadly this report will not push BLizz to fix the big issues of the game. That is low population servers. Game has gone from 12 mills down to 9.6 now and Many servers feel empty - even with CRZ. And Blizzard is forcing players to pay 25$ per character for transfers. Thats probably how they are making most of their money in WOW now. Sad.</div></div><hr />

I quit playing about 2 years ago but I still get annoyed by haters sometimes, they really are worse than annoying fanboys because atleast the fanboys know what they're talking about (most of em anyway).</div></div><hr />

I'm an active player (since very early wrath) and am concerned about the health of the game I love. I like the current p2p model and content development.<br />
<br />
Why haters are interested in the sub #'s:<br />
<br />
BECAUSE THEY ARE STALKING A VIDEO GAME THAT THEY USED TO PLAY.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What other things from 2004 are you still doing? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004_in_video_gaming<br />
<br />
Are you still playing Doom 3, or Pikmin 2, by chance? Perhaps JFK: Reloaded.<br />
<br />
I'm willing to bet that the entire calendar year of 2004's videogame releases, excluding World of Warcraft, has sub 250,000 people playing their games. And WoW still has 9.6 Million.<br />
<br />
Blizzard has earned [Doing the Improbable]<br />
<br />
Still play Unreal Tournament 2004, Rome: Total War, and Counter-Strike: Source. <br />

The issue is not the amount of people leaving, but the brand new people buying and playing the game. If those numbers drop it's because WOW does not attract enough new players to maintain the player base and allow it to renew itself or grow.<br />
<br />
It's totally normal to see people leave the game. Problem is, not enough new people joining it versus people leaving. So the emphasis should be on how to attrack NEW players.<br />
<br />
Returning players are not really your goal there, because they are bound to leave again.<br />
<br />
How many people you know in WOW that have just started player this game? I know I don't know any. And apparently the community is attrocious against those players because they tell them to learn to play, etc, and obviously don't remember how they were when they joined the game.<br />
<br />
Personally I am part of the loss.. I closed my 2nd account which I had up to do RAF to level a monk..<br />
Early after Cata launch it was talked about in an interview to someone high up in Blizzard that WoW was no longer bringing in as many new players to offset the losses and that going forward that they would need to be focusing more on player retention.<br />
<br />
Mike Morhaime just made a statement that the playerbase is more ready to leave and that they have made changes in MoP that are directed in keeping players engaged in the game and faster content patches to keep them occupied. First quarter report after Cata launch the developers did say that their goal was faster content patches and trying to keep players involved and their first large hitter was the daily zone which sadly was as far as they went to follow through with their goals. Going back to the grind model in MoP seems to have been the better way to go in terms of player engagement unlike the gut the grind model that Cata had adopted. <br />
<br />
The subscriber loss is small, though it comes close to what Cata left off to show that at the moment MoP is not doing any better in terms of subscriber numbers. The shift to the new VP gear being behind a raid grind instead of a daily grind might be related to the subscriber loss.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ro9ue</div><div class="date">2013-02-07, 10:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yea I guess that's true. People who are saying, including myself, that it's an &quot;8 yr old game&quot;. Well from a business expense perspective, it's requiring just as many resources and capital to keep it updated and release new expansions. It's not like they made vanilla WoW and just maintained 10 million subs for 9 years. They are spending money, updating graphics, etc to keep it up to date. So is it really an '8 year old game'? Yes and no.</div></div><hr />

WOW has been carried by China (over 60% of playerbase). So this is really more of a shock for me since I was sure we would be seeing an Asian look WOW increase the player numbers. I think the dmg in EU and US is much bigger than what BLizz makes it look like.<br />
<br />
That's a valid consideration for sure. It would be nice to see some statistics breaking down account types - those with multiples, banned, etc along with recently canceled subscriptions from region to region, along with new subscriptions since MoP's release.</div></div><hr />

WoW's heyday is long past and has been for awhile. people will claim that other people who claim WoWs heyday was BC are just wearing rose colored tinted glasses but i really believe its the truth. it was a time period in which i had the most fun out of just about any game ive ever played.<br />
<br />
for me personally BC was a new beginning, it was something out of the ordinary. WOTLK came around and it had me hooked because i wanted to see the ending of Arthas. Cata proved to me that WoW was essentially the same thing its always been but that they had killed off any meaningful characters i once cared about (even though i remember deathwing from wc2). this was a major reason i quit during Cata. it wasnt because of the gap in content releases, it wasnt because there were imbalances across the classes. it was because after playing the game for as many years i had i realized it was essentially the same thing it was when i first started playing.<br />
<br />
before people jump on my ass about my opinion id like to say that i dont think WoW is a bad game. in fact i love blizzard games, warcraft 1 was the first computer game i ever played and ive played them all ever since, with the exception of MoP and SC2, but i truly believe that this games best days are behind them. WoW will continue to be popular, it will continue to sell well in all its incantations and the sub number will ( i believe at least) probably rise again above 10 million subscribers. unfortunately for someone who loves the WoW lore as much as me, this doesnt translate into an enjoyable game</div></div><hr />

Then the cycle repeats itself.<br />

I think people don't give Blizz enough credit when it comes to bouncing back from 500k~ sub losses, in the end this means nothing to me, I'm still gonna play the hell out of the game and enjoy it :3<br />

Not really. Chinese players probably grinded their brains to 90 in a day, then capped their valor in 1-2 days. Got bored and quit. They thrive on grinds which doesn't appeal as much to NA/European players. Remember when Wow officially launched in China over 5 million of the subs were from there so there's a lot of room for them to bleed still.</div></div><hr />

What we can say for sure that the grind in MOP is aparently not solving any issues. So - BLizzard already failed to improve on Cata model when it comes to that. We are only 4 months into the expansion - and Im one of those that left cause of the new systems. Nothing in 5.2 will make me return. If something - It just proofs to me I did the right thing leaving the game when I did.</div></div><hr />

They should not expect a &quot;stable&quot; player base. WoW is a game with a population that fluctuates a lot over time depending on various factors. This is why Blizzard doesn't like to merge servers. If there is a spike in population because of new content or whatever, players are going to get log in queues and everyone will get pissed.</div></div><hr />

The game is freaking 8 years old. rather ask yourself why it STILL has 9.5 million whily all the shiny new games like Rift, GW2 and SW dwindle around 500 000 to 2 mill. I mean..here they have all the info on the MMO C forum why WoW sucks and is dying to make awesome games that drag the players in by the million.<br />
<br />
Ofc WoW will dwindle and eventually fade out. How many people still play other games from 8 years ago.<br />

That's a really ridiculous statement. DLC is adding some stuff like new weapons (or items in general), outfits, maps, campaigns and all that stuff. An addon on the other hand usually changes the whole playing experience.</div></div><hr />
