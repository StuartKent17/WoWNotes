No one half way competent would EVER take the mend pet glyph in pvp. This has nothing to do with PvP. It's a nerf to soloing. One more nerf in a long line of soloing nerfs (growl, distracting shot, pet intervene, etc).<br />
<br />
Unglyphed : 25% over 10s<br />
PTR-Glyphed : 25% over 5s but with 10 sec CD so 25% over 10s still<br />

Its the last tier of the expansion so the problem of them being BiS next tier does not matter.

Swords against popular belief are the worst weapons against opponents with armor, warhammers and axes were more feared on all battlefields. Yeah WoW is a fantasy game so anything can go, but I am not surprised a proper weapon was picked.</div></div><hr />

Its like they want to drive the nail even further into the coffin and split the wood so I wont play after this exp. Ill probably quit right after finishing the 5.4 raids and the only thing that will bring me back would be a successful overhaul of the class that plays well and has a no pet option.<br />
<br />
Seriously I wish I could slam a keyboard over their hands whenever they go to touch any more hunter abilities. It would be better if they just left them alone even if we are subpar in PvE.</div></div><hr />

id say the biggest problem is it does not fill a niche over the other 2. <br />
<br />
chi torpedo is decent free healing, especialy in a group stack. for instance, its pretty good to use as a tank on magera if you want to help the healers during rampage. <br />
<br />
xuen is a big dps cooldown, and it helps a ton when you need to burn something quickly like adds. It also does significant aoe damage. back on windlord, xuen was better over all for the fight than RJW even with the buff to crane kick, he did so much aoe damage to the adds, and he was still usefull in the 2nd half. <br />
<br />
I can see though where they may be trying to go for &quot;this is a relly good option for aoe&quot;, it looks like its ment to change your cranekick to not stop you from using other abilities. that means as a tank you could still use your defensive abilities, keep this up, and use kegsmash with out stoping this. Its got some possibility on fights where aoe is needed through out the fight, like say tortos.</div></div><hr />

<br />
All of my what and why...<br />
<br />
Ice Lance was buffed because Mastery got completely overhauled. Frost Mages were running with a lot more than 29% extra frozen damage with the old Mastery so this ends up being a net nerf, and a HUGE nerf to burst.</div></div><hr />

The Lock and Load nerf is COMPLETELY uncalled for (Survival is dead middle of the dps pack for general dps specs) and will make Survival completely unplayable. Likewise, the Mend Pet nerf will mean farewell to Hunter soloing and pet sustainability in raids. But given how many of the data mined things have looked off/inaccurate today, I'm not gonna raise the alarm...yet.<br />
<br />
I have played SV since WOTLK and I get my Lock and Load procs from Black Arrow not Explosive Trap. I usually don't use Explosive Trap on single target anyway so I'm shooting Multi with the Explosive Trap. I shoot Explosive Shot with Black Arrow, which should still proc Lock and Load, on single targets. This change doesn't bother me. However, I am bothered by the change to the Mending Glyph and wonder why they decided to change it.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ilfayt</div><div class="date">2013-07-19, 01:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If the new Rushing Jade Wind is un-channeled, I could definitely see myself taking it on my monk instead of Xuen. I currently use Xuen as a 'dps boost' even though I'm a tank since my other options aren't all to attractive for anything other than a little damage and a tiny bit of versatility, versus tons of damage that might help beat 'enrages'. It seems they're trying to make it more appealing for us in the 'versatility' department. It also looks like it will be more energy efficient regardless(4 second duration compared to spinning Crane Kick's 2 second).<br />
<br />
<br />
No one half way competent would EVER take the mend pet glyph in pvp. This has nothing to do with PvP. It's a nerf to soloing. One more nerf in a long line of soloing nerfs (growl, distracting shot, pet intervene, etc).<br />
<br />
Unglyphed : 25% over 10s<br />
PTR-Glyphed : 25% over 5s but with 10 sec CD so 25% over 10s still<br />
<br />
hehe blizzard, good joke. The glyph is now completely useless. Smart devs.<br />
<br />
It's actually a 'buff' in burst situations where the ability to heal in those 5 seconds matters more than the continuous ability to heal for more(it's '100% more' in those first five seconds since it's ticking twice as fast) Now that's 100% more of baseline, so it's actually a lot smaller gap when comparing it to the old Glyph. I think it would be better if the cooldown was a little shorter(8 seconds?) or it 'also' increased healing by 30%(half the old effect), but still can be useful in some situations(using it as a 'heal' instead of a health regen buff on your pet that it feels like now, because of how stretched out it is). Definitely a glyph to keep an eye out for as the PTR goes on.<br />
<br />
Edit: Just wanted to make clear, I still realize it's a nerf overall, but it does look like it's fitting more in bliz's line of making glyphs that 'alter' abilities to allow them to be 'powerful in a situation'. Hopefully they do even it out though...it seems a little harsh with the 10 second CD and reduced effectiveness.</div></div><hr />
