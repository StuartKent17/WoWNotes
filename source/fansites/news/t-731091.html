<br />
I'm not one to complain about content, and I don't really care if a raid is easy or hard, but the whole place cleared in a couple of hours? And it's the last hurrah in WotLK? Really?<br />
<br />
I'd imagine they'll see a large drop-off in subscriptions after this. No, it's not going to be significant enough to greatly harm them, but still. Will most of these people come back for Cataclysm? Yeah, of course, but it seems like they could have kept getting their $15 from those 100k people for a couple extra months if they made this a little more difficult, or made it a two-boss raid, with the last being Algalon-esque, only available after beating hard mode.</div></div><hr />

Its called a charity. I cant imagine what you would do when you heard about the political fund-raising dinners when they cost several thousand dollars (USD) per plate, and you dont get anything in return. And it all goes to get some scumbag politician elected.</div></div><hr />

It's $500 USD for food at a fancy hotel, charity, a BlizzCon ticket (value @ $150 USD), a signed print of Blizzard artwork and not to forget: A chance to talk with the developers over at Blizzard.<br />

I think the point is; if you have have 24 hours jump start it's not fair to say &quot;world first&quot;. EU servers are still down, and for most of us will still be down for another 12 hours. Boubouille has put on the front page &quot;US first kill&quot;, while Premanition go that extra mile and call it &quot;world first kill.&quot;</div></div><hr />

Will you just fuck off. You're talking about a guild that goes all out to get World First. They probably raided it to death on the PTR and did normal with alts (duplicates of mains) a few times before going for it.<br />
<br />
Even if it is easy, who the fuck cares? For god sakes, if you're after a head-banging, wrist-slitting difficult game, WoW isn't for you. It never was and never will be. It is a mass-market, mass-appeal game and I'm pretty sure Blizzard wants it that way. They may throw some hard encounters to the tiny percentage like Prem who live, breath and sleep WoW, but they know exactly who brings in the serious money.<br />
<br />
Now please, find something else to whine about because most of us couldn't care less.</div></div><hr />

No d00d, wow is failz. Is that the best you can come up with? This game is clearly dying because Blizzard is making money off of pets and a guild that raided Halion on PTR was able to kill him in 10 man heroic on the first day. It's infallible evidence that makes complete sense in my head!</div></div><hr />

Why on Earth is EU ppl complaining that their servers are down and they can't get US 1st kill???<br />

EU will never get US 1st kill, sorry, only EU 1st avaiable to you guys.<br />

The only players who should complain about something are the ones from the US servers with 24h maintenance. THEY didn't have the chance to get a US 1st kill (or this &quot;2/3 US 1st kill&quot;, whatever).</div></div><hr />

10 man heroic probably isn't as hard when you're skilled enough to be the number 9 guild in the world, are in full ICC25 Heroic gear, and have already done the fight before on PTR.<br />

let me clarify it for you, EU servers have their normal maintenance because of the patch so they are down (isn't Wednesday maintenance for EU anyway?) 40 US servers have been down since maintenance was over that more than 24 hours of downtime.<br />

<br />
And what does that have to do with anything? US servers are online hence the kill and my point was, when US servers are up and EU are down are people surprised who got the first kill? try using your brain and I'm sure you will understand what I meant, I didn't mention any metric shit, but the fact is, US servers are up EU servers are down, does your IQ even hit 2 digits?</div></div><hr />

well ya I find it kinda lame.. 200 tickets for 500 each? how much is that.. erm.. 100,000$ and I am sure they won't give much more then that but they will give it under Blizzard's name and make then look good and nice, while I am pretty sure they won't mention that they took money from some kind of dinner where ppl can meet there developers.. sorry but I can't see it worth to eat with some of them for 500, I better give my own 500$ to an hospital or so where I am 100% sure they will need it more.</div></div><hr />

Somewhat good publicity, with somewhat minimal expenses.<br />
<br />
I´m not being negative, and yes I am glad that the children atleast get &quot;something&quot;.<br />

<br />
No, that doesn't mean that WoW would be failing. The community has grown a lot during the last year, and its not because people think this game has near to impossible encounters.<br />
<br />
Just because WoW starts to aim more at the casual players rather than the hardcore, doesn't mean its dying. Its dying for the hardcore players, and growing for the casuals.<br />
<br />
Not that I'm happy with WoW is turning to, but still, its defitenly not dying. I liked it more back when raids and instances were harder, shit, everything used to be harder. No this game has turned more of a time spender for me, but well, I won't mind that too much either.<br />

Worst thing is maintenance extension is during the day for us, not night.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's... the chat-window...<br />
<br />
Seriously, an add-on? O.O The probably just blurred it because they don't wany people to be reading their chat/the guy who filmed this doesn't want anyone seeing any personal stuff like friends coming online, whispers coming in etc. <br />
<br />
inb4 &quot;no one cares about his friends/whispers&quot;: you + everyone else =/= the guy who filmed this.</div></div><hr />

Harder than the majority of stuff in WotLK. There have been many bosses where losing 1 person might as well be a wipe; they all get outgeared eventually.<br />

<br />
wow is dying.. face it... and RS is prove of it... HM downed in what... less then 10 hours?<br />
<br />
Pleasing as much as possible? With allr over 80 % of the player base not content, even if servers are still offline?<br />
<br />
Making millions of dollars... ye, im sure they did that once.. and maybe still now, by milking this game to the max with <br />
<br />
all these stupid pets / mounts / char possibilities. As said, wow is dying... milking it to the next big MMO<br />
<br />
So ye... blizz, u fail... or do i actualy fail for still paying ur sorry ass for extended maintenances and shitty new content. <br />
<br />
Is this realy the best you can come up with....<br />
<br />
<br />
It's a filler raid, it's not meant as progression or anything amazing. Filler raid.<br />
<br />
WoW is not dying. Before both other expansions the game goes stale and people feel bored about it, plus it's in the middle of summer right now so less people play.<br />
<br />
Stop your ridiculous doomsaying, we've all heard it before and it's not right this time either.<br />
<br />
The reason the maintenance was extended, as far as I can imagine, is not because of the new in-game content, but because of Bnet 2.0, something you seem to have no clue about.<br />
<br />
So yeah, you're just another nitwit without a clue, thinking you know it all.</div></div><hr />

Quoted for Truth.<br />
<br />
<br />
Either people need to quit declaring &quot;World Firsts&quot; and only acknowledge NA/EU firsts or they need to quit bitchin' when a World First occurs. <br />
<br />
Technically, it IS a world first. Life isn't fair, get over it. I don't care about &quot;servers were down!&quot; bullcrap. Either you acknowledge a World First when it occurs or you quit caring and only pay attention to each continent (which makes a helluva lot more sense anyways). <br />
<br />
Personally, I could care less about world rankings. What the crew in the EU is doing doesn't impact me in the least. Heck, I couldn't even tell you any major guilds over there outside of Ensidia (and that's only because of all the fanboys around).Frankly, I don't even care about NA rankings for that matter. The only NA guild I could name that's not on Detheroc or Executus is Premonition (once again, due to fanboys).<br />
<br />
Really, I don't even know why I visit the forums. All it is is flames and crying and hypocrisy.<br />
<br />
Ps. Another pet peeve, calling the North American servers &quot;US&quot; servers. I realize we're a big country and all but Canada is our partner in crime when it comes to WoW.</div></div><hr />

Nope, techincally speaking it is NOT a &quot;world&quot; first. To be &quot;worldwide&quot; you have to include everyone and claim you was the first. But if you exclude half the world (or so), you are still the first... of your half. That's all.</div></div><hr />

I'd simply take the entire day and just refund it. It's proberably pretty expensive to get all their engineers to do overtime anyway. Plus you don't get angry customers (I bet they've had a few dozen angry calls already).</div></div><hr />

Technically, it IS a world first. Life isn't fair, get over it. I don't care about &quot;servers were down!&quot; bullcrap. Either you acknowledge a World First when it occurs or you quit caring and only pay attention to each continent (which makes a helluva lot more sense anyways). <br />
<br />
Personally, I could care less about world rankings. What the crew in the EU is doing doesn't impact me in the least. Heck, I couldn't even tell you any major guilds over there outside of Ensidia (and that's only because of all the fanboys around).Frankly, I don't even care about NA rankings for that matter. The only NA guild I could name that's not on Detheroc or Executus is Premonition (once again, due to fanboys).<br />
<br />
Really, I don't even know why I visit the forums. All it is is flames and crying and hypocrisy.<br />
<br />
Ps. Another pet peeve, calling the North American servers &quot;US&quot; servers. I realize we're a big country and all but Canada is our partner in crime when it comes to WoW.<br />
<br />
&quot;Could care less&quot;, I think you mean &quot;Couldn't care less&quot;.</div></div><hr />

And the fact they have sucked ass at patching for years, this patch isn't that big and they still needed 18 hours or something? these Blizzard guys really fail, I don't mind some delays sometimes but it's pretty much mass delays with every patch, what the fuck do they get to do? do they have 2 people working on the patch or something? it's a joke that a company as big as Blizzard can't do simple things.</div></div><hr />

It's a norm that Blizzard screws up every single time there's a patch. Even for small patches. And when a large one hits there will always be atleast a few thousand players who can't log in for several days.

<br />
Here is some evidence for you...<br />
<br />
The vast majority of guilds can't field 25 players any longer on the vast majority of servers. Blizzard realized this hence why they shifted to 10 man raiding in the expansion.<br />
<br />
So...<br />
<br />
40 man &gt; 25 man &gt; 10 man<br />
<br />
Each and every time the raid population has reduced it has corresponded with a drop in population. When is the last time you saw Blizzard add a new realm because of population? They can't even keep the realms they currently have full.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My honest opinion is Blizzard CEO and executives were sitting around trying to figure out how they could throw a huge party to stroke their own egos. They knew they couldn't charge people to attend if the proceeds went to Blizzard, so they decided to give it to charity. Of course, if they are giving all proceeds to charity it means Blizzard is fitting the bill, so in short, your subscriptions dollars just went to throw Blizzard executives a huge party you have to pay to attend, and they still can't manage to keep up their own servers. Charity or not, something still smells.</div></div><hr />

When LOTRO / Star Trek Online / Champions Online / City of Heroics / City of Villains / Age of Conan / Aion are serious competition to World of Warcraft (or even half as good) please let me know. :)<br />

2) Blizzard does another amazingly nice thing for charity and people still want to make blizzard out to be a-holes.<br />
<br />
The reason for the QQ (besides certain individuals automatically wanting to QQ about anything they see) is that relative to how much money is paid to blizzard on a monthly basis the charity dinner is an extremely small gesture. In absolute terms it is an extremely nice gesture but still very small.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Some ppl are kinda dumb (or trolls)... For this kill to be a really world firs, we will have to w8 for EU servers to get up and than see, if no one in EU will down RS in the same timespan(as I know it was downed at first night), than it would be world first... Relatively that is.</div></div><hr />

Point being, why do we just have to wait for the 'EU' servers for it to qualify as a world-first? Why not the chinese servers as well? Or is it just a 'Western Powers' first?</div></div><hr />

<br />
WEll, as I've said, relatively... relatively to Europe that is. And I don't really see any Chinese players complaining here tbh. Ofc, if you want to be ultimately pedantic (or just love to bitch around), let me rephrase: A real world first kill can only be that kill, that took the least time to accomplish starting from the moment servers of these region were brought online in comparison to all other region's first kills under same conditions.</div></div><hr />

On the fly patching without downtimes or even forced disconnect.<br />
<br />
&quot;A new patch has been deployed, please restart your game.&quot; Thats the way patching should be done.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's not designed to be a fresh interesting encounter.<br />
The chamber of the Aspects are all of similar size -- so how many bosses do you intend to fit in that small area?<br />
<br />
More importantly, Blizzard has even stated that Ruby Sanctum isn't designed to be a big raid.<br />
It's two (or three) things:<br />
A: Development into the Cata Pre-launch event. (Since Cataclysm is all about Deathwing's return. Deathwing created the Twilight dragonflight. Deathwing also has a personal grudge against Alexstrasza -- as such it's the twilight dragonflight laying siege upon the chamber of the Red dragon-queen. Can't you guys understand this is just an advance into the story?<br />
B: To break the monotony of doing icecrown citadel week in and week out because there are no end-game options for players who can't spend 4 hours clearing.<br />
C: To tide you over with something new to do until the next content patch.<br />
<br />
So. . .just relax. This raid isn't meant to impress you with its insanely complicated fight mechanics. This fight is designed to pave the way, storywise into Deathwing's personal grudge.</div></div><hr />

Point being that there actually are other games than WoW around. And there are other things to do. Some people really DO need this &quot;break&quot; to actually figure out that the world is more than....World of Warcraft *cough*<br />
<br />
And in my personal opinion, Star trek is pretty good, Champions is fun for the cartoony feeling, City of villains is fun when you have other people to play with and Age of Conan have some interesting aspects that WoW lack. <br />
I play LOTRO because I just like the Lore, not much else.</div></div><hr />
