Merrymaker (http://www.wowhead.com/?achievement=2144) is part of What A Long, Strange Trip It's Been (http://www.wowhead.com/?achievement=2144) to get the Violet Proto-Drake (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/september/8970/mount_violetprotodrake.jpg). I assume that most of you will try to complete it, here is a small guide to help you becoming a Merrymaker! <br />
<br />
On Metzen! (http://www.wowhead.com/?achievement=273)<br />
Complete http://static.wowhead.com/images/horde-icon.gifMetzen the Reindeer (http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=8746) / http://static.wowhead.com/images/alliance-icon.gifMetzen the Reindeer (http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=8762), Metzen is still in the Searing Gorge and in Tanaris, just like all the other years. You can check the map on wowhead (http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=15664). The quests for this achievement start in Orgrimmar / Ironforge depending on your faction. (Like pretty much all the quests for the event) <br />
<br />
Scrooge (http://www.wowhead.com/?achievement=259) / Scrooge (http://www.wowhead.com/?achievement=1255)<br />
Another &quot;free&quot; achievement, just buy a Snowball (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=17202) and throw it at King Magni Bronzebeard (http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=2784) in Ironforge or Cairne Bloodhoof (http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=3057) in Thunder Bluff depending on your faction.<br />
<br />
'Tis the Season (http://www.wowhead.com/?achievement=277) <br />
To complete this achievement you will need a full set of Winter clothing. <br />
Red Clothes (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=34085) / Green Clothes (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=34087) are crafted by tailors. <br />
Winter Boots (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=34086) are crafted by leatherworkers.<br />
Red Winter Hat (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=21524) and Green Winter Hat (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=21525) are slightly more difficult to obtain. You will need to drop them from various bosses in instance. <br />
<br />
Just like last year, the drop locations for these hats have been updated for level 80 players to prevent them from being soloable (but the red hat probably is for the stronger classes, the easiest way to complete the achievement is obviously to rush the nexus with a friend). The known drop locations in Wrath of the Lich King are as follow: <br />
Red Winter Hat (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=21524) - Grand Magus Telestra (http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=26731) (The Nexus), Jedoga Shadowseeker (http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=29310) (Ahn'kahet), <br />
Green Winter Hat (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=21525) - Mage-Lord Urom (http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=27655) (The Oculus)<br />
Feel free to contribute with the missing drop locations in comments.<br />
<br />
The last part of the achievement is the Graccu's Mince Meat Fruitcake (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=21215) is contained in Smokywood Pastures Extra-Special Gift (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=21216) and Smokywood Pastures Sampler (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=17685), they will be mailed to you after freeing Metzen (see the first achievement) or completing Treats for Greatfather Winter (http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=7025).<br />
<br />
Simply Abominable (http://www.wowhead.com/?achievement=279)<br />
Complete the http://static.wowhead.com/images/horde-icon.gifStolen Winter Veil Treats (http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=7042) / http://static.wowhead.com/images/alliance-icon.gifStolen Winter Veil Treats (http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=6963) questline. They require you to talk to the Strange Snowman (http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=13636) in Alterac Mountains to get a quest (http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=7043) to kill The Abominable Greench (http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=13602)<br />
<br />
Bros. Before Ho Ho Ho's (http://www.wowhead.com/?achievement=1686)<br />
When you're done laughing at the name of the achievement, you can check the small guides in Wowhead comments for both faction:<br />
Horde (http://www.wowhead.com/?achievement=1685#comments:id=439083)<br />
Alliance (http://www.wowhead.com/?achievement=1686#comments:id=415758)<br />
Alliance players have to talk to a lot more people, but Horde players have to go through Northrend (and eventually end up in Icecrown, it might be a problem for players below level 77). The hardest part of the achievement might be getting the Mistletoe (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=21519), to obtain it just type /kiss while targeting a Winter Reveler (http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=15760). (This is a random &quot;drop&quot;, you might have to try it a few times to actually get the Mistletoe)<br />
<br />
He Knows If You've Been Naughty (http://www.wowhead.com/?achievement=1689)<br />
Open one of the presents underneath the Winter Veil tree once they are available. You only need to open ONE present and not all of them, it's basically another free achievement. The presents are only available from December 25th to January 2nd and you'll have to wait a few days before you can complete this one.<br />
<br />
With a Little Helper from My Friends (http://www.wowhead.com/?achievement=252)<br />
Earn 50 honorable kills as a Little Helper from the Winter Wondervolt machine. The machines are outside Orgrimmar / Ironforge, just step into it to get a 30 minutes transformation buff and enter your favorite battleground to kill a few people! (Note that the transformation does NOT persist through death, you will have to finish/leave the battleground and get another transformation if you die)<br />
<br />
Fa-la-la-la-Ogri'la (http://www.wowhead.com/?achievement=1282)<br />
Complete Bomb Them Again! (http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=11023) after transforming your mount with Preserved Holly (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=21213) / Fresh Holly (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=21212) rewarded from various quests and Winter Revelers during the event.<br />
<br />
Crashin' &amp; Thrashin' (http://www.wowhead.com/?achievement=1295)<br />
This achievement requires to use the special ability of your Crashin' Thrashin' Racer Controller (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=37710) and smash other player's racer (Video (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF4zHsCtVlY). This item is available from the presents under the christmas tree and won't be available before December 25th. (Except if you still have unopened presents from last year)<br />
<br />
Let It Snow (http://www.wowhead.com/?achievement=1687)<br />
During the Feast of Winter Veil, use a Handful of Snowflakes on each of the race/class combinations listed below. This achievement could be hard because the only way to get Handful of Snowflakes (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=34191) is by kissing Winter Revelers once an hour. Hopefully, they're not soulbound and can be sold / exchanged between your characters, depending on how desperate you are you could just create level 1 characters to get enough of them. (You could also do that to sell tons of them at the AH ... but you can't sell conjured items.)<br />
<br />
The Winter Veil Gourmet (http://www.wowhead.com/?achievement=1688)<br />
Depending on your character, this might be the hardest achievement. It requires you to cook Gingerbread Cookie (http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=21143) Egg Nog (http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=21144) and Hot Apple Cider (http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=45022). The patterns are all available from the NPC, there are only two small problems:<br />
<br />
You will need Small Egg (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=6889) for two of these recipes, and will probably have to run to a low level zone to farm them along with 30 other players. (Buying them at 50G/stack at the AH is also an option)<br />
Hot Apple Cider (http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=45022) require 325 cooking skill! If you never took the time to level your cooking, you will have to go through all the leveling just to complete this achievement.<br />
<br />
Needless to say that the price of cooking reagents will most likely skyrocket.<br />
<br />
A Frosty Shake (http://www.wowhead.com/?achievement=1690)<br />
During the Feast of Winter Veil, use your Winter Veil Disguise kit (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=17712) to become a snowman and then dance with another snowman in Dalaran. The Winter Veil Disguise kit (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=17712) is one of the reward mailed to you after completing Stolen Winter Veil Treats (http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=6963).</div></div><hr />

I have zero cooking, so ggblizz, hell no that im gonna level 325 when in 2 days pvp starts up again..<br />
<br />
quite lame<br />
<br />
<br />
You could've checked the holiday achievments earlier...<br />
<br />
You are kind of guy who comes to raid and when your raid comes to a boss you ask whats the tactic...<br />
<br />
So it's not ggblizz, but more ggnoobslacker.</div></div><hr />

Doesn't matter where you do it, but Searing Gorge is closer for Alliance from Ironforge.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It is even not a question of solo or not-solo.<br />
For one of the quest(Grim(oire) Business (http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10998)), you need 5 players to summon Vim'gol the Vile (http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=22911)</div></div><hr />

Retribution pala here, took me 1 WSG with failing hordes. Got Wrecking Ball too, btw. Awesome BG! <br />

Unlike some people i did not spend time in beta, even though i had a key.<br />
<br />
Next to that, since it went live i havent been drooling over upcoming events or whatever..<br />
<br />
And i have the bloodsail title aswell.. didnt know this was a problem but as i read a few posts ago it is..</div></div><hr />

Because there's no mount involved at the end. duh. Making generalizations about what achievements people &quot;should&quot; or &quot;shouldn't&quot; care about is dumb.<br />
<br />
I have 0 cooking and I'll be leveling it up to 325 to get this achievement. Not that big a deal. The only real big pain is that is has to be done while this event is active since Sparkling Cider only lasts for 2 days.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think he was more addressing the people that cared enough about the bloodsail admiral achievement to grind it and totally disregard the cooking achievements. Grinding cooking is 1 thing, and in and of itself is not that hard at all. Grinding rep with gadgetzan so you CAN grind cooking is more annoying, but involved a choice on the users part. I don't think anyone is whining about grinding cooking, but choosing to grind bloodsail rep disqualifies you from whining about this imo. But to each his own, so I'm not going to start an e-yelling match over whether or not you agree with me on that point.</div></div><hr />

<br />

Shammertime is incorrect about the costume. red/green variants cannot be worn at the same time because that would require two torsos, and as special as Shammertime would like you to believe he is, two torsos don't come as standard on any class.</div></div><hr />

I have 0 cooking and I'll be leveling it up to 325 to get this achievement. Not that big a deal. The only real big pain is that is has to be done while this event is active since Sparkling Cider only lasts for 2 days.<br />

i've re-read that half a dozen times. it SOUNDS like he's being sarcastic, but I seriously can not believe a blue would be stupid enough to post something like that even as a joke or to make a point. he's representing the company and you KNOW it will get taken out of context if he is being sarcastic. you can't do stuff like that on a &quot;company&quot; account.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Plawsky</div><div class="date">2008-12-16, 02:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't see why people are so pissed about these achievements. For the ones people are complaining about:<br />
<br />
Ogri'la: So many people are in the same boat as you, so finding groups should not be too hard. And if you can't get some guildies to help you, your guild is full of douche bags. All 3 of the 5-man quests should take about 15 min to complete. So this complaint is worthless and easy to get around.<br />
<br />
Cooking: Last week I had cooking of 50-ish and I leveled it up to 325 (for this achievement, I read ahead). It took an hour or two, mainly because of all the running around I had to do. There's plenty of guides out there that make it really simple. If you have the bloodsail title, I guess you've got extra work to do. However, if you were willing to grind all the way to friendly with them, it shouldn't take too long to get back. You should still get to keep your hat, title, and achievement.<br />
<br />
Costume: Yes, you have to get a little bit lucky for this one. But it seems like the hats drop off easy, resettable bosses. Just get a few friends and grind the mage boss in Nexus until you all get one. If you're not high enough to get into those instances - then I guess you're SOL. However, the Hallow's End achievement required drops too, and I'm sure others will (get a brewfest mount, etc.). And it seems like you can try for this multiple times a day - so it shouldn't be too hard.<br />
<br />
If you really care a lot about achievements, then you probably won't mind going through the extra trouble to get this one. I think they're trying to make the holiday achievements somewhat difficult to get, so only true achievement whores get it. Just think about all the rep you've most likely grinded (God, I've killed so many ogres) - this is going to be WAY easier than that.</div></div><hr />

Ya, it seems like that's gonna be how it is. Luckily, I decided to get the Brew of the Month membership just for something fun to do, so I guess I'll be getting my mount next October! However, they might change it next year so you can drink all of the brews of the month at once just by joining - you never know how things are gonna be in the game next year.</div></div><hr />

Clever...I had to read it twice, but Zarhym is in fact saying that he is not required to get the achievement. Unlike the masks or the child week pets...this is simple grinding. No luck, no repeated years, just grinding. There is not a valid reason to remove it...but they may yet...who knows.</div></div><hr />

Ya, it would probably be nice if they removed the necessity to kill bosses in raids to get loot too. Achievements are for people who want to do the work for them. Removing these kinds of requirements would just add to the arguments that Blizz isn't making anything challenging.</div></div><hr />

try to read ahead next time, you were so excited you forgot to check out the requirements for the drake?

The achievements came out right after brewfest. Yeah, maybe it is my fault I didn't look into what was going on in beta and digging some where deep down figuring out what I would need in a years time or what the rewards would be. I have fun with the Achievements, I like doing them. I was mainly commenting about the people complaining that they need to level cooking to 325, when they are going to go throughyear of work and get all the achievements to realize they have to wait another year to get the drake. And a year for an achievement is a little much...<br />
<br />
And to whoever said they would grind rep to get a drake, this is a proto drake not the regular ones, you cant get these through rep. Only hard achievements and terrible drops.</div></div><hr />

He also told me that he wasnt sure if this bug would get fixed before the end of winters veil so if you wanna be sure to get title and in the long run the protodrake (if you hunt it ofc) some months earlier, then you have to reset talents :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
You obviously check MMO-Champion so you should have known that it was going to be an achievement. You have no excuse not to have gotten it during Brewfest.<br />
<br />
DK's have a valid complaint with it as they had no access to Brewfest, but that's just a sacrifice you have to make when you chose to roll a DK. You are not going to have access to a lot of the achievements that pre-wotlk characters will have.<br />
<br />
The only achievement that makes me really nervous is Perma-peddle. Now that is one where you could give 100% effort and still not get it due to RNG. Which is really lame. I almost didn't get a tooth pick at Halloween; I got it on the last day of the event after probably 60 trick-or-treats, and I very well could not have gotten it, so that's another lame RNG achievement.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I only started playing last year, and I missed the summer festival, so Brewfest was my first world event - meaning I don't know much about all of them. What exactly is the perma-peddle achievement? I know you have to get a pet, but is it a drop like the Brewfest mounts? If that's the case, I hope that it will be easier to obtain this year, as I don't know if I'm lucky enough to get the Kodo AND the pet drop. But I guess that's why it's a difficult (or lucky) achievement.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's more like the tooth pick achievement from Halloween. You get a box to open once per hour of played time and it has a 2% chance to contain a vanity pet that gets you the achievement.<br />
<br />
These boxes used to not be soulbound, so you could get them on your alts and send them to your main. But as of patch 3.0.8, they are soulbound.<br />
<br />
If they don't significantly boost the drop rate on that thing, it is going to be a massive QQ-fest.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for clarifying. I did some research though, and as of '08, it's no longer 1 hr played. Now you can log on once every hour and get your shot at the pet. But we don't have to worry about that for another 2 months - I'm just focused on getting Merrymaker right now.<br />
<br />

<br />
The Beer of the Month thing is pretty dumb. 99% of players didn't get it, and that's not even mentioning someone starting a new character. I expect Blizzard will remove it from the meta-achievement, it will be dumb if they do not.<br />
<br />
<br />
So should people who start a new character also get full epics? Flying mounts? Reps at exalted? I mean, that's only fair right? They haven't been there as long, so they should be automatically caught up with everyone else. Speaking of...I never got my Phoenix mount off of Kael, and neither did 99% of other players. I'm going to open a ticket to get that. Thanks for the idea.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The Beer of the Month thing is still dumb. It adds an entire extra year onto this meta-achievement. There's zero reason for that, take it out and add in some other challenging achievement that can be completed during Brewfest.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">haarits</div><div class="date">2008-12-17, 02:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I never stumbled across the &quot;Brew of the Month required for Brewmaster/Long Strange Trip achievements&quot; info until after 3.0 hit and I read about 'em in-game. I was 8 tokens short of getting BOTM, had a bad week and didn't do too many dailies, and figured I had one last day. Well, I didn't realize that &quot;Ends on X date&quot; meant &quot;Ends at 4am on X date, server reset&quot;. So much for that!<br />
<br />
But in reading about BOTM, it says you can buy previous months' brews from the BOTM vendors. Seems like it might be possible for new BOTM members next year to simply buy the previous year's brews all in one go. It certainly would ease the sting of missing out on it the first time.<br />
<br />
The larger problem, to me, is the mount requirement, just like the Love is in the Air pet. I saw one Brewfest kodo drop, no rams, and lost the roll; last year I wasn't able to buy one (I wasn't yet 40, for one thing; racing on the rams for the dailies was my first mount experience). If HH's mount had been required for The Hallowed, I'd be outta luck there, too. Saw it drop 4 or 5 times, lost every roll. What I'd like to see for Brewfest '09 is the ability to buy your own faction's mount, but the boss has a chance to drop the opposite faction's mount, and merely having one mount, ram OR kodo, is required for the achievement. <br />
<br />
RNG achievements can be pretty painful; while I hardly saw any mounts, I saw the pumpkin pet drop about a dozen times fighting HH, and got it 2 or 3 times from trick-or-treat bags. Toothpicks were also frequent drops for me, and seemed very strange to me since you get 10 at once, yet they're only good for a one-time achievement &amp; a silly buff (like the Northrend mood food I suppose). AND they're soulbound, so you can't supply alts or less-fortunate guildies/pals with a quick achievement.</div></div><hr />
