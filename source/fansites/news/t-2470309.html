Patch 8.1.5 PTR - Portal Removal<br />
On March 12th, Patch 8.1.5 brings an old player request to life: A Portal Hub for each faction capital! These new rooms are located in Stormwind/Orgrimmar and contain portals to many different major locations in WoW. Check out the changes inside.<br />
<br />
The portal room was suppose to clean up the mess in Orgrimmar and Stormwind while making things a tad more convenient, not make things worse.<br />
<br />
There’s no way to get to the Caverns of Time<br />
No teleport to either Ironforge or Thunder Bluff in the room<br />
There’s no way to get to Karazhan/Blasted Lands/Hellfire Peninsula edit: apparently there’s an NPC to teleport which is nice<br />
The teleports to Pandaria are in a much worse location (Shrine&gt;Forest)<br />
Other portal hubs have basically become obsolete due to lacking any portals<br />
<br />
<br />
Like come on Blizzard, we’re losing more than we’re gaining with this update.<br />
I understand that changes can throw people off a bit at first, but I also think they help keep the world of Azeroth feeling alive. When there are fewer portals, does the world feel a bit bigger to you? Do you like that? How difficult is it to get to the locations you mentioned without a direct portal (talking to everybody who isn’t a mage here)<br />
<br />
I do agree that it makes the world feel bigger. It is undeniably less convenient though.<br />
I agree, but how convenient should things be for everybody? Why do mages have portals? Should everybody just have the teleport abilities that mages have? I don’t think that’d feel right, heh.<br />
<br />
In addition, what about the legion artifact quests?<br />
I didn’t get a chance to verify it, but the plan was for the portals to show if you are on these quests.<br />
<br />
For the part that was brought up about things like Ironforge being removed from the BfA portal rooms, I don’t think that’s intentional and should be changed in future build.<br />
<br />
What content are folks doing in like CoT that the portal helps so much with? What about other areas? How much time do you think the new setup will add to your journey?<br />
<br />
I’m sorry. Sometimes it can be difficult to tell in a post without a voice, but … Is this sarcasm here or are you actually being serious?<br />
I wasn’t being sarcastic. Apologies to you and others who felt I was dismissing them in any way.<br />
<br />
For how I personally play and enjoy games, I like when I feel like I need to travel for a few minutes to get somewhere. For me, it is more rewarding when I complete the task that way and I wouldn’t want to be able to get everywhere instantly but there is a good medium to find (but continuing to pile up various teleporting items feels strange). Traveling over large areas reminds me of how vast the world is and I often reminisce while flying on a flight path or a mount. Sometimes I have even just used the port to Timeless Isle and taken the flight path to Shrine (instead of going straight there) as I can enjoy the view and relax.<br />
<br />
That being said, I know I can be a bit strange and I’m often not bothered by things that bother others - that’s why I ask a lot of questions. I want to understand the different play styles and opinions of others so I can better discuss them both with you and internally. Getting to the fundamental impact is important for me as the solution sometimes requires a different approach. Hopefully I can avoid the feeling that I’m just talking at you and want to be talking with you. Cheers!<br />

<br />
To be fair it's not the same people saying both quotes. You have the classic purists that want everything back to Vanilla when it was terrible to level or raid as half the specs but except for their class which JUST HAPPENS TO USUALLY BE A MAGE OR WARRIOR. Like gee, no wonder they enjoyed it... :rolleyes::rolleyes:<br />
<br />
Then you have the people that don't want to spend hours just to get 1 level or to spend hours in trade chat looking for a group just to get through 1 measly dungeon after 50 hours of getting to the point where you're attuned just to even enter the dungeon. They enjoy streamlined content where you can log on if you only have an hour and still get some enjoyment of the game. <br />
<br />
Right now Blizzard is just missing the mark completely trying to mix both back in by adding an absurd &quot;RNG&quot; element on the gear as well as the farming for azerite power and they just now realized they made a wrong choice after doubling down.</div></div><hr />

Two crowds.<br />
I cannot help but view the first as children who cannot see the whole picture of the game (or any game, really). If you take back anything from them, even if it globally makes the game better, they are completely unable to understand it. They would add a teleport anywhere command if they could, because it would be more convenient. No reasoning about game rules and design is possible with that crowd.<br />
<br />
Now repeating like a parrot that the world is better without portal is not enough either. It's important to understand why. And it has to do with the randomness of what happens in an open world. What you'll find, what you'll fight. To make the world truly more alive, removing portals might only be the first step. The map itself needs to hold interesting content.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No it's removed in both new dal and old dal on the PTR. As for the Shatt NPC, you have to be revered with Caverns of Time on the character you're on in order to use the portal, which most people aren't on their alts.</div></div><hr />

So fucking rewarding to alt-tab for 5 minutes. Somebody, please plug his connection to reality cord back in.<br />
<br />
&gt; For how I personally <br />
&gt; For me, it is<br />
&gt; Traveling over large areas reminds me<br />
&gt; Sometimes I<br />
<br />
&quot;Me, me, me, me, me&quot;. Not everybody is you. And, anyway, everyone who wants to travel by FP still got their FP - portals do not replace them. You only make it worse who prefers to travel with portals, when FP lovers weren't ever affected in any way.<br />

<br />
I think they should go another route and slightly revamp the system:<br />
<br />
Seperate the eye color from the Blood Elf faces and add it as the custom option, maybe also add blue eyes for some high elf hype.<br />
Seperate face paint from the Troll male tusks and add it as a eperate custom option. Add it also for the females.<br />
Add facial markings for male Night Elves.<br />
Add tattoos/face paint/body paint for many races.<br />
Add some jewelry for other males and some females like Tauren, Night Elf or Troll<br />
Seperate Nose, Chin and Ear customization for goblins.<br />
<br />
<br />
As for portals. Most of those removed portals aren't that necessary. But the portal room should have Cavern of Times(there's a lot of instances there), Ironforge/Thunder Bluff, Darkshore(Darnsassu)/Tirisfal Glades(Undercity), Pandaria portals should be linked to Shrines not Jade Forest. Borken Isles portal should be to Dalaran and if they don't want two Dalaran portals then the Northrend one could be to Wyrmrest Temple.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You first sentences are completely correct, FP or ships have the same problems regarding that as portals. Well one could say they might look better or increase immersion but that's not what is discussed here. So I fully agree with you about that.<br />
However, I think travel outside of ships/FPs/portal (actually walking/riding in the open world) can be interesting. In my opinion that's what Blizzard tries to promote here.<br />

I understand your point but that's like saying hacking in shooters is fine. It's just more options, don't use the hacks if you don't want to and if they complain just ignore them... More &quot;options&quot; isn't always better. There's no denying less portals makes the world feel more alive. You lose convenience though so there's a trade off. You can't please everyone I guess. Personally I think keeping the convenience at this point is probably Blizzard's best course of action, and hope that Classic fills the void for the players who like a more lively / interactive world.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If high elves are ever implemented they will be and should be alliance only agree with the rest as far as customization goes but those portals do server an important purpose they reduce congestion. When everyone is in one place on a server is when you get lag and since they moved to a cloud style architecture rather than each server being on it's own blade lag happens with way fewer people than it used to. Having only one portal room is going to make a major lag area.</div></div><hr />

And separate the beards and eyebrows on Night Elve males, so we can actually have an option to have no beard WITH eyebrows. <br />

Has this approach ever even worked? It’s this attitude that creates the disconnect between developers and the playerbase.<br />
I’m still salty over losing flying even though they were sure that “I would like it I just didn’t know yet”. I mourn expansions like WoTLK or TBC where content was specifically created with flying in mind.</div></div><hr />

Right?! Something that should’ve been in the game from day one. I hate toxicity and negativity, but I can’t help but be dissapointed in this. It just makes me sad.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Spl4sh3r</div><div class="date">2019-03-04, 05:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't get the questions about Portals or rather the arguments they put out why it is bad.<br />
<br />
First of all, no portal to Ironforge/Thunder Bluff. Of course there doesn't need to be one. Both of those locations has a quick taxi to get to. Orgrimmar&lt;-&gt;Thunder Bluff has the airships. Stormwind&lt;-&gt;Ironforge has the Deeprun Tram. Why do people need a portal when there is already a travel path there, it is also close enough to use a regular flying taxi or even flying mount.<br />
<br />
Secondly, Caverns of Time. There has never been a portal there from the main hub. The way to get there has always been through Northrend Dalaran or Shattrath City (if you wanted the portal route), or you can just take the portal to Uldum and fly. There is no need for a direct route from Orgrimmar/Stormwind's new portal room, because there is no quests that need to be done at Caverns of Time while you are playing around in the major city. That's like asking for a Level 100 portal to a Level 10 zone, portals should only be for locations that are relevant for your level, which is why the portals for Caverns of Time exist in the older main hubs when it was relevant.<br />
<br />
Thirdly, Karazhan/Dark Portal/Hellfire Peninsula. That people mention Karazhan seems to just be because of mount farming. It is a dungeon like most others, why does it need a special portal? I know it had one in Legion, but that was most likely because it was in another continent from the rest of the expansion zones. Not to mention the portal from Atiesh. As for Dark Portal and Hellfire Peninsula, if the portal in Orgrimmar/Stormwind for those zones are removed, then it might be annoying, unless they are available from the quest that tells you to go there. Though if they are available from an NPC then I see no issue, it doesn't really need to be an actual portal you click, if it still is accessible from an NPC.<br />
<br />
Lastly, Pandaria. My only question here is, why do you need to go to the main hub in Pandaria? Most of the content in Pandaria is out on the continent and not in the main hub.</div></div><hr />

It's just more options, don't use the hacks if you don't want to and if they complain just ignore them... More &quot;options&quot; isn't always better. There's no denying less portals makes the world feel more alive. You lose convenience though so there's a trade off. You can't please everyone I guess. Personally I think keeping the convenience at this point is probably Blizzard's best course of action, and hope that Classic fills the void for the players who like a more lively / interactive world.<br />
<br />
The problem is Blizzard keeps re-adding the convenience and then removing it and then they seem confused why people get annoyed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've played this game since classic. I've seen the world. It no longer holds novelty to me. I also have a finite amount of time, so if I have to spend half my available playtime waiting on a boat or on a 15 minute flightpath, I'm just going to say &quot;fuck it&quot; and do something else. Going to guess I'm probably not alone on that point.<br />

There actually has been a portal to the CoT in New Dalaran as well. Just adding that, since your listing missed it.<br />
I personally think CoT just annoys people because even with the portal available, there is still quite a bit of flying down that hole, not least the actual dungeons inside usually being time-consuming for RPs.

Bornakk isn't new. He might be the oldest CM still on staff (not that there are many still around). He just spent a long time inactive on forums I think because his posts tended to rile people.<br />
<br />
In any case, CMs don't have any control over any of this anyway. They are more or less just a mouthpiece for those that make these decisions and it's their literal job to spin it in a positive way. At this point, people getting mad at him are just shooting the messenger.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They want more time attached to everything so they can guarantee players time investment into the game, it is pretty apparent, even the change to the global cooldown this expansion was a huge step towards this mindset, at this pace the game is going to go free to play quicker than I though it would. If they go free to play then it makes sense with all of this time gating and limitation of content more so than ever. Now if you pay for your premium account you gain access to the new content right away, but it will still be gated so that you don't get to burn through it too quickly.</div></div><hr />

I was giving an exaggerated example to prove a point. It also applies to taking away abilities(gust of wind, lightning bolt while moving) removing ways to make gold (legion tables, old raids being nerfed), etc. You say &quot;just don't use Gust of Wind if you don't like it, don't ruin how I like to play&quot;. Other more reasonable people understand that things existing effect players whether they want use them or not and it's not always an &quot;option&quot;. You seem more worried about being right though to even attempt to understand Blizzard's logic. Carry on and keep trolling.</div></div><hr />

If Blizzard really wanted to make the world bigger they'd take away the ships that are more or less portals. Then add in oceans and islands and such so you have to sail between continents. Zones need to be twice the size they are now or three. <br />

This removing of portals isn't about making the world bigger. Smoke and mirrors time gating is what it really is.</div></div><hr />

Do you even know what &quot;time gating&quot; is or do you just like repeating that buzz word you see here on mmo-c? Adding or removing portals is NOT time gating. If there was a portal to a place that is only accessible by that portal, and said portal is not operational for another week or longer, THAT would be time gating.<br />

Otherwise the only thing removing portals does is waste server and cache data as people spend extra steps entering/loading multiple zones instead of A-to-B. They want players to go through the whole fucking alphabet to make the world feel larger? Naw, their stockholders care about player retention so when they see players spending less time actually playing, regardless of what that playtime actually involves, they get frowny faces.<br />
<br />
Portals should be something that you unlock while questing (which many were/are). If they're worried about people using portals to skip areas they don't like, don't allow people to access portals until they unlock them.<br />
<br />
This is just Blizzard trying to artificially/arbitrarily extend their game for people leveling alts. New players won't notice any different. Its the people leveling alts that are being inconvenienced.<br />
<br />
Remember they did similar shit when they released Allied races the first time. A bunch of arbitrary shit, mainly via leveling experience reworks, to extend the time it took to level new allied races.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because of sharding/phasing, people no longer give a crap about world pvp confrontation that is happening on the fly because they can just shard/phase away from it. <br />
<br />
People no longer go out and hunt for/give a crap about old-style rarespawns because if you play the sharding/phasing game correctly, you can just hop into a shard that has the rarespawn you're after. <br />
<br />
People no longer value interacting with players out in the world because it is EXTREMELY unlikely you'll ever see the same player ever again because they'll be shuffled off into the abyss of shards never to return. <br />
<br />
Warmode also filters the world through shards at the press of a button.<br />
<br />
<br />
And we're to believe removing all these portals is going to get people into the world and make the world feel more alive and immersive? At least limiting flying was somewhat believable from an aesthetic and &quot;interacting&quot; point of view, but it too is just a bandaid fix for a much larger issue.</div></div><hr />

I cannot help but view the first as children who cannot see the whole picture of the game (or any game, really). If you take back anything from them, even if it globally makes the game better, they are completely unable to understand it. They would add a teleport anywhere command if they could, because it would be more convenient. No reasoning about game rules and design is possible with that crowd.<br />
<br />
Now repeating like a parrot that the world is better without portal is not enough either. It's important to understand why. And it has to do with the randomness of what happens in an open world. What you'll find, what you'll fight. To make the world truly more alive, removing portals might only be the first step. The map itself needs to hold interesting content.<br />
<br />
What makes the game better for you =/= what makes the game better for others.<br />
<br />
Please enlighten me how the game will be better for me as an Alliance player when I have to take the long as flight path from Ironforge to Western Plaguelands on 12 characters or so every day for a couple of weeks during the Winter Veil holiday in hopes of getting that toy with 1% drop chance.<br />
<br />
What exciting thing will I find on that flight path? Who will I fight on that flight path?<br />
I would really like to know, because the only thing I know I'll get(or lose rather) is about a total of 1 hour in travel time on all characters combined.<br />
I'd much rather play the game than sit through the same damn flight path I've taken so many times since I started playing the game 14 YEARS AGO!<br />
<br />
Even if they would remove flight paths and even player flying so I would have to go there on a ground mount, or even run, all I will find are other max level Alliance players like myself and the odd leveler(most likely also Alliance).<br />
We wouldn't speak to each other nor gather around a campfire and sing Kumbaya. We would all just be annoyed we have to spend so much time traveling all the way up there for a toy with a shitty drop rate that we still want because we like collecting things - or just enjoy the Winter Veil event that happens once a year.<br />
That and the fact that the Horde capitals and portals are so much more convenient placed than the Alliance ones so they wouldn't have to put up with the same thing but still have the audacity to demand we have to do that because they don't want to take a portal somewhere - a portal that is optional to take.<br />
<br />
When I want to run out and explore the old uninstanced world(which I do now and then), then I do that - but I don't want to do that when I'm about to do my weekly dungeon/raid runs on all my characters to collect transmog gear, legendaries I never got the chance to get when they were current content or that mount that never drops so I have to run the same raid one million times.<br />
If you want to use your mount or run by foot to get anywhere, why don't you do that? Why do you have to drag me into it? Why can't you enjoy your part of the game and I enjoy mine?<br />
<br />
If you want the old world to be more alive, you start by adding things to do in it before you remove the portals - not the other way around.<br />
Another idea is to not place all the damn holiday events in northern Eastern Kingdoms so Alliance have to spend more time travelling than doing the actual event while Horde players can just take a step outside their city gates.<br />
<br />
You're the child here expecting everyone to play the game in the way you want it to be played.<br />
You're the child here not being able to resist taking that instant portal even though you have the choice not to take it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
First of all, no portal to Ironforge/Thunder Bluff. Of course there doesn't need to be one. Both of those locations has a quick taxi to get to. Orgrimmar&lt;-&gt;Thunder Bluff has the airships. Stormwind&lt;-&gt;Ironforge has the Deeprun Tram. Why do people need a portal when there is already a travel path there, it is also close enough to use a regular flying taxi or even flying mount.<br />
<br />
Secondly, Caverns of Time. There has never been a portal there from the main hub. The way to get there has always been through Northrend Dalaran or Shattrath City (if you wanted the portal route), or you can just take the portal to Uldum and fly. There is no need for a direct route from Orgrimmar/Stormwind's new portal room, because there is no quests that need to be done at Caverns of Time while you are playing around in the major city. That's like asking for a Level 100 portal to a Level 10 zone, portals should only be for locations that are relevant for your level, which is why the portals for Caverns of Time exist in the older main hubs when it was relevant.<br />
<br />
Thirdly, Karazhan/Dark Portal/Hellfire Peninsula. That people mention Karazhan seems to just be because of mount farming. It is a dungeon like most others, why does it need a special portal? I know it had one in Legion, but that was most likely because it was in another continent from the rest of the expansion zones. Not to mention the portal from Atiesh. As for Dark Portal and Hellfire Peninsula, if the portal in Orgrimmar/Stormwind for those zones are removed, then it might be annoying, unless they are available from the quest that tells you to go there. Though if they are available from an NPC then I see no issue, it doesn't really need to be an actual portal you click, if it still is accessible from an NPC.<br />
<br />
Lastly, Pandaria. My only question here is, why do you need to go to the main hub in Pandaria? Most of the content in Pandaria is out on the continent and not in the main hub.<br />
<br />
Your entire post can be summarized in &quot;I only do max level content and have no idea what other players are doing when they play and I also don't care I just want everyone to play the game the way I play it - screw them&quot;.<br />
<br />
Many, MANY people run old raids and dungeons on many characters every week. Week after week. That adds up a lot of travel time if they remove portals that have been there for many years without any issues until suddenly because reasons.<br />
The Pandaria main hub is in the middle of the Pandaria map, so it's the most convenient place if you want to travel in any direction to do x. How that logic is eluding you is beyond me.<br />
<br />
My only question here is, what harm does it do if there are a couple of convenient portals to main cities/hubs or places with a lot of dungeons/raids that people are farming?<br />
I lied; another question: if you want to crawl from Ironforge to Hillsbrad Foothills while I take the portal from Legion Dalaran to Dalaran Crater, why don't you just do that - why do I have to crawl just like you?</div></div><hr />

You can't really classify everyone who doesn't give a crap about content from 14 years ago as children. It makes you sound childish. Better is subjective and you're completely unable to understand that. There is nothing engaging about spending 5 extra minutes on a flight point to get to Thunder Bluff.</div></div><hr />

Do you know what I do when I take a FP? I alt tab and do something else. Nowadays, more often than not I have a visual novel game running at the same time as WoW so I don't feel like I'm wasting time. <br />
Have to get to a WQ? Get FP, alt tab, play something else. When you land there's a specific sound, so I'll alt tab back when I hear that. Sometimes, flights take as long as 8 minutes in Kalimdor. Even when the flight is short, I start looking at achi pane, pet pane, xmog pane. Tell me, what do you do when you fly? Cause I can't believe there's actually someone out there who sits on the mount and looks at the screen enjoying the scenery for the 400th time.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Koward</div><div class="date">2019-03-05, 08:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">“You don’t know what you like, I know what you like!”<br />
Sounds like gaslighting.<br />
<br />
Has this approach ever even worked? It’s this attitude that creates the disconnect between developers and the playerbase.<br />
I’m still salty over losing flying even though they were sure that “I would like it I just didn’t know yet”. I mourn expansions like WoTLK or TBC where content was specifically created with flying in mind.<br />
<br />
That's a perfectly valid question. <br />
It's totally about &quot;You don't know what you like, I know what you like&quot;. And you are right, that's how disconnection can happen between devs and players, if devs are wrong in their judgement.<br />
But to some extent, the whole entertainment industry is about putting trust into authors, producers, developers, designers.. to make something you like. Unfortunate truth is that most people (and I include myself when saying that) do not know how to make something that pleases them. They can smell something is bad when they try it, but to come up with an efficient solution is much harder than to say &quot;hey there is a problem with that&quot;. And it's very hard to ask yourself &quot;Do I know exactly how to build something I like?&quot; because you intuitively think &quot;Well yes of course&quot; if you don't think deeper into the implications of your own ideas.<br />
<br />
So in a short way, it's really hard to think what boundaries a box should have if you are inside the box. Of course everything can be abused and a balance always needs to be found but letting the players hive mind directly pick decisions for the game does not necessarily lead to game they will prefer.<br />
<br />
TLDR: Players can say something is bad, but it's much much harder to guess a good solution when you are not trained in game design.<br />
<br />
<br />
What makes the game better for you =/= what makes the game better for others.<br />
<br />
What exciting thing will I find on that flight path? Who will I fight on that flight path?<br />
&lt;...&gt;<br />
If you want to use your mount or run by foot to get anywhere, why don't you do that? Why do you have to drag me into it? Why can't you enjoy your part of the game and I enjoy mine?<br />
<br />
If you want the old world to be more alive, you start by adding things to do in it before you remove the portals - not the other way around.<br />
&lt;...&gt;<br />
<br />
You're the child here expecting everyone to play the game in the way you want it to be played.<br />
You're the child here not being able to resist taking that instant portal even though you have the choice not to take it.<br />
<br />
A) Nothing, flight path have the same problems as portals regarding that. You are right.<br />
<br />
B) This is a well-known &quot;don't like it don't use it&quot; argument. That can't be used for anything multiplayer-based since players follow the path of least resistance. If you want interactions between them you have to make sure most of the time players take the intended path.<br />
<br />
C) Now that's a very good point. Blizzard should definitely have thought about making the portal alternative interesting, and put it before or in the same patch.<br />
<br />
I do not expect everyone to play the game the same way someone intended, but I definitely believe they are tendencies in the behaviors of players (including myself), and that you can use those to direct players towards interesting content.<br />
Everyone is able to pick its own rules (like not taking any portal), but you must understand the power of common rules and their impact in multiplayer games. It's not Skyrim.</div></div><hr />

What's the point of making the world feel bigger if they have no plans whatsoever on making it worthwhile and useful to travel actively?<br />
<br />
There's no interesting events happening, no treasure chests that are worth opening, no rares worth killing, nothing. So there is no point making it feel bigger if it's empty and devoid of excitement and fun. I have seen the scenery over a thousand times, I don't need to see it yet another time.<br />
<br />
If they keep using that stupid excuse over and over again, at least fix the damn game to justify said excuse. Leveling alts is a travesty.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is a Pandora's box scenario, you cannot undo damage to the experience once it has been done. There is no real cause for removing the portal network as it is now. The game has grown exponentially larger than Vanilla ever dreamed of being, back then you could get away with not having a portal to every location. Now? its difficult to imagine even finding the ports and boats needed to get to some locations, and some expansions (MoP onward) dont even have a fucking way to the content, it literally is just a damn portal to access it!<br />
<br />
So to say the world is going to &quot;feel larger&quot; after removing these portals is just farcical, the game is already large to the point its exceedingly problematic to not have them in place for basic navigation's sake.</div></div><hr />

That's a good point. The world is much larger than it was before we had portal access everywhere. Even with all of the portals the world still feels bigger to me than in Vanilla for example... because it is.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It doesn't make any sense to only apply these &quot;pro-immersion&quot; measures on a few select parts of the game, while the rest and majority of the game doesn't give a damn about immersion.<br />
<br />
Those who want Vanilla are likely either not playing, or certainly not using the portals to get any Vanilla-like experience. The people who were actively using those portals regularly are people who were likely farming old content for gold, mounts or transmogs on a weekly basis. This change won't make any difference for them apart from making their farming runs unnecessarily longer.<br />
<br />
It doesn't make the world dangerous, it doesn't make the world interesting, it doesn't create interaction opportunities with other players, it offers no additional gameplay other than hopping on your flying mount, getting high up in the air and pressing auto-run while aimed in the direction of the place you want to reach, and then waiting till you reach it.<br />
<br />
Just because in a vacuum it is technically more &quot;vanilla-like&quot; to have less portals, it doesn't mean it will offer a more &quot;vanilla-like&quot; experience, and more importantly, a good experience, especially when it is a tiny &quot;feature&quot; that goes in an entirely opposite design direction of what the game has been for the last half of its lifespan.</div></div><hr />

I guess &quot;throw a bunch of questions at posters&quot; is the new deflection method, since they fired the guy who had some social skills. (Bornakk has been there a while, but he's still a bit...rusty on that whole &quot;talk to players&quot; thing, because he seems to have spent most of his time there avoiding that.) (The only way this could be worse is having Lore talk to the dickba...er...forum posters...that would be a true shit show that would require a pallet of popcorn to be delivered) <br />
<br />
I mean, c'mon. Removing convenience is a good thing, for 'muh nostalgia&quot;? That's what Classic is for. WoW has 15 years of expansions, there should be MORE convenient travel, especially for level capped players. Okay, fine, make players unlock portals as they level, but do they really think people sit and watch the scenery on flights at this point? And, how does &quot;Gee, it makes the world seem bigger!&quot; is laughable when you can enter almost all of the end game content via a LFG/LFR type tool. Do they even make you find the entrance to dungeons anymore? <br />
<br />
And gimme a smallish effing break on the &quot;class fantasy&quot; nonsense, Bornakk, Ion and his band of merry class destroyers don't have a single fuck to give for that. And, mages can make portals anywhere, which is their real strength, the portals everyone else uses don't move around like mages can, and people will still have to travel to the hub/portals. Hey, you tried, Bornakk. I know. It's not your fault. It's not your fault some dev decided his personal pet project was screwing up what most other small indie dev studios insert seamlessly into their content to give convenience to their players. Because, hey, what do they know, right? <br />
<br />
I just love the logic of this:<br />
<br />
New content you haven't found on the map, PVP, raids, islands, warfronts: teleport to instantly.<br />
<br />
Old content you already played: WALK ALL THE WAY UPHILL IN SNOW! NO U! WORK FOR IT! YOU WILL HAVE THE NOSTALGIA WE INSIST ON!<br />
<br />
Most games reward time spent, in all kinds of small ways, through perks like instant travel and such, so players can play more easily, and feel like they accomplished something. Because everyone wants that &quot;Spent 10,000 Hours On A Gryphon&quot; achievement, or can't wait to sit on a dock waiting for a boat. Boy, that's a great use of your time, isn't it? I just love World of Waiting For Boats.<br />
<br />
Travel is not content, boys. <br />
<br />
But oh, no, not World Of Ioncraft. You LOSE stuff the more you invest in his game. Because that's the Fun™ he and the devs insist on you having, while micromanaging every aspect of the game they still allow you to play. I guess it's about time for Ion to wave a Bee mount at everyone to distract them, again. Players are paying too much attention to the Fun™ again. <br />
<br />
The mindset of the devs continues to baffle and amuse. I can't think of a game dev team that is as passive aggressive towards their own customers, like the WoW devs. It's fascinating, which is why I still come by these forums.</div></div><hr />

Now people will enjoy the world as they travel!&quot; No, it doesn't work like that. Removing the summon means a warlock is almost a necessity in a raid group. People still log in exactly at raid time and ask for summons without moving an inch themselves. Removing travel portals means people will just go AFK and/or alt-tab to do something else during flights. You're not adding anything meaningful.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">crimsonhead</div><div class="date">2019-03-06, 07:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This doesn't make any sense. You don't &quot;find&quot; or &quot;fight&quot; anything while you on FP or ship. And portals are exactly the same, only faster. It is not like portals are porting you to any arbitrary place. So, no, as long as we have any other auto-travel, removing portals only WASTES GAME TIME, not adds anything &quot;interesting&quot;.<br />
<br />
I just thought of something - what if they DID do this? What if they actually found a way to make zones that we are traveling over engaging and exciting but not forcing us to really sit back and ignore one of the more boring-ish parts of the game. I would love an option to &quot;instant dismount&quot; wherever you are (get a parachute or whatever) and when you do you get an item called &quot;call me back!&quot; that lasts for 5 minutes then expires - you can do what you need to - hit that item and BOOM go back to your FP and where you were going. Thinking of this sort of like a drop ship / call back mechanic. I really feel like if there was engaging content in the world we are flying over since that's what they want us to &quot;experience&quot; in this &quot;big world&quot; why not FILL that world with things that make it feel big?! <br />

Did I say that? Read what I posted again and refer to the implication i.e. &quot;look where we are&quot;. <br />

You're wrong though, they don't listen to anyone other than themselves and their shareholders.</div></div><hr />

Hence why I'm glad that they do that. Catering to everything the player base wants would create and utter mess (and before you say it, yes, messier than this expansion allegedly is). They don't always make the correct decisions, but the decisions are theirs to make. It's their choice, their creative decisions, and that shouldn't be constantly influenced by what an ever changing and toxic community &quot;wants&quot; (or thinks they want). There's that old saying - if you don't like it, go else where.</div></div><hr />

It's not black and white, I never said they should listen to 100% of the playerbase all the time.<br />
Listneing to shareholders that only care about $$ and player retention is also trash.<br />
