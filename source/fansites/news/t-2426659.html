Darkmoon Faire Profession Skillups<br />
As Dalbozz has stated, these quests currently only increase the base or &quot;Vanilla&quot; level of a profession, up to a skill of 300. For more information please see the relevant support article that we created for this question:<br />
<br />
With the profession changes in patch 8.0.1, Darkmoon Faire profession quests will only increase the base level of a profession up to a skill of 300. While this is an intended change we are looking to improve this experience in a future patch. If you have feedback regarding this change please submit a suggestion.<br />

Pa'ku Totems Addon<br />
A new addon (https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/paku-totems) has been created to display Pa'ku's totems on the map and minimap while also showing the destination when you mouse over the totem. This should help Horde players who chose Pa'ku get around more easily!<br />

It’s not need to navigate the city, it’s an add on to track totems that people can pick to get around the city faster.</div></div><hr />

It's not in any shape or form needed though.<br />

And we have Boralus where everything &quot;important&quot; is close to each other, while the horde one you need to do one of 1.paku your way up/down; 2. just go jumping (love rogues/DH now); 3. go normal way and takes a lot more than it should; 4. pay gold everytime you want to go for mog/boat - bank/portals.<br />
<br />
It's not missing sense of direction, it's taking long than it should, or could...and this will all go away once we can fly lol</div></div><hr />

ikr, Boralus is basically a small town with everything useful then bunch of districts around it with nothing. Trolltown has the empty shit in between everything useful.</div></div><hr />

I'll take them making cities that feel alive and follow the vision of a zone, rather than dumbing it down and making everything super convenient. In the end, we'll be able to fly in Zuldazar as you said. The gold we need to pay to travel between points is laughable to boot.</div></div><hr />

I'm at close to 40 mythic island victories (only did 3/4 this week, as less time) and haven't got anything except dubloons. I was really excited about all the drops at first, but no I'm not gonna bother past the weekly.</div></div><hr />

I feel that darkmoon faire is counter to what was intended for professiosn in BfA. It feels like Professions were made this for the relevant content and the past was an optional &quot;to-do&quot; thing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Doubling a droprate of 0.01% just means its now 0.02%. Which, in Blizzard land where self-delusion is the way of life, is a MASSIVE INCREASE TO DROP RATES Y'ALL!!!!!!!</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Palemoon</div><div class="date">2018-09-04, 06:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">To me it looks like they simply didn't consider the new profession system in combination with the Darkmoon Faire. They would need the game to check what professions the player has learned, which one has which skill level, and then also decide where to put it. (As &quot;Just put it towards the latest addon&quot; would also mean that once you're peaked there, but lack skill in earlier addons, it would be wasted again).<br />
So instead they just say &quot;Hey, put it towards the base skill and be done with it&quot;.</div></div><hr />
