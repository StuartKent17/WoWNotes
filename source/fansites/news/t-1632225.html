Things aren't really perfect right now, but Blizzard is working on it! <br />
We’re excited to finally launch Warlords of Draenor and explore this new world with you, but we know that the experience has been less than ideal as we approach our first full day of launch. <br />
<br />
Europe was our first region to launch, and we encountered a few issues due to the sheer number of players attempting to enter Draenor from a single location. We worked to add multiple new ways to access Draenor, and this helped ease some of the initial rush into the new expansion as players were able to access it from their capital cities, as well as from the shrines in Pandaria.<br />
<br />
While that solution helped a ton for our North American launch, we ran into a few other issues, including a distributed denial of service attack, that resulted in increased latency.<br />
<br />
To help correct for this and other issues, we’ve temporarily lowered maximum realm populations. This means there will be high queue times experienced on high-population realms. <br />
<br />
Here are some of the other important issues we’re currently working to address:<br />
<br />
<br />
Instance servers timing out, which may impact dungeon access<br />
Continent server issues, which are resulting in Player Not Found and disconnection issues<br />
Garrison server issues, which are resulting in phasing and performance issues<br />
<br />
<br />
We’ll post updates here as we make progress against these issues. Thank you for your zeal to face down the tyranny of the Iron Horde—and for your continued patience as we work to improve the current experience.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Login Queues<br />
In attempts to pinpoint latency related issues we’ve temporarily lowered the maximum number of people allowed in each realm. This will result in higher queue times as realms who have populations above the cap will not allow any new players in until it decreases back down below the new player cap. We’re continuing work on this and other issues impacting game latency.</div></div><hr />

Why do I get the feeling this is just a sham excuse to justify high queue times so the play experience for those in the game is good and therefore launch day reviews won't necessarily be as critical? Incidentally they removed all those realm first achievements as part of their design. Hmmm.... *tips tin foil hat*<br />

This in the end has all the hallmarks of a Ddos attack and combined with some poor design choices at the starting quest areas has led to a domino effect.

There are anti DDOS techniques out there. Blizz just refuses to pay for it apparently. Seems funny Google, Facebook, and Youtube never suffer from DDOS attacks and they have billions more users.

<br />
To play devil's advocate, why tear down your means of communication? Many of the trolls who DDOS use social media to keep their uh... 'trolly?' image alive and well. Oh and another thing, you claim they NEVER suffer attacks, so how would you know whether their systems can handle it?<br />

Then suddenly it's down to a DDoS attack. How are you picking out packets that signify that there is a DDoS in progress. There is no human eye on earth or anybody on earth who can search that many networking logs to find such bullshit. This has also come out of the blue, I think you're just covering up for the fact that your networking engineers cannot do their job and haven't done their for the past 10 years. Please put your networking engineers on the CCNA course to start and then CCNP and show them what a router is. Then they will realise that this many players trying to login at once on the same day from all around the world, will fuck your shitty fucking badly configured £10 dlink routers.

Blizzard has been ddos'ed SEVERAL times in the past couple months. For a few days in a row even. What makes you think they are lying about it now?

Google, Facebook and Youtube run thousands of nodes throughout the world. You DDoS a specific node, you might knock out Facebook for part of the UK and that's it. To hit Facebook entirely, you either drop their DNS servers or you get the IP of every node and build the worlds biggest botnet and then still, you might only slow it down a little. Do your research or shush.<br />
<br />
CloudFlare can also be bypassed easily so don't bring that up either.<br />

What else it is? We can talk about that it is intended behavior and not an assault, but the server lines did not handle the amounts... that is DDoS like from textbook. Also... one does not simply increase server capacities. Even if they bought an extra computing server(s) for launch, the optical line to their data center is limited.</div></div><hr />

hating on blizzard for an mmo launch with hundreds of thousands if not millions of people all logging in at once is like hating the ocean level for rising with the tide. Nothing can be done about it.</div></div><hr />

We can talk about that it is intended behavior and not an assault, but the server lines did not handle the amounts... that is DDoS like from textbook. Also... one does not simply increase server capacities. Even if they bought an extra computing server(s) for launch, the optical line to their data center is limited.<br />
<br />
This isn't a DDoS. Notice how only the big realms are suffering? Go to any low population realm, you can level fine without lag. I know this because I've done it today to test. If it was a DDoS, not only would the big realms be suffering but every realm would be AT LEAST lagging. Hell, realms might even be down entirely. The login servers are also up but lagging. DDoSing a login server doesn't take much but for some reason, even with all the traffic of the players, it's alive. You really think it's getting DDoS'd? No.<br />

&quot;Merged servers&quot; is a logical construct, not a physical one; the base servers are still physically separate. Granted, Blizzard has yet to really appreciate scalability like they should, anyone saying a DDoS cannot possibly be taking place is committing a false argument; the same could be said if I said that one was (beyond the admission of Blizzard themselves).

<br />
1: Servers like the ones they use cant just be bought at Best Buy. They need to be ordered. That takes time.<br />
2: When they arrive, they cant just be put into the rack and start running.<br />
3: They need to be prepared and installed and the data replicated. That takes time.<br />
4: They need to be implemented, routed and set up to work with existing servers. That takes time.<br />
<br />
Not only does all this take time, it also costs a lot of money. And by the end of all of the above, the servers have gone back to normal and fixes will be in place, and the company is out millions of dollars in hardware and manpower, and the servers cant just be taken back. Yes, I know they have a lot of money, but that doesnt mean they can just spend millions on stupid stuff...thats not how a business works.<br />
<br />
So buying more servers would be stupid not only in a business sense, but would also be idiotic for anyone with COMMON sense - which sadly isnt really that common anymore<br />

I started playing WoW when I was 19, single, working only 3 days a week on a graveyard shift and living at my parents house with 0 responsibilities otherwise, so naturally, I was able to play constantly and perhaps too much at times. Now a days however, being much older, married and a stay at home dad of 2 young children, I only have a small time each day that I can play now that doesn't take time away from my kids or my wife (priorities after all!) and granted, this is launch day, I'm on a high pop server, etc. this is WoW's 5th expansion, 5 being the key number here, and imo...they still haven't found out the way to solve the problems that occur with a new xpac and for guys/girls like me that greatly enjoy the game and the toons they play but can't dedicate their lives to it (like I pretty much used to) the game is unplayable. By the time I get passed the queue (which is now 399 minutes...really?) I won't have even a minute to log in.<br />
<br />
At the end of the day it's blizzards fault, not ours, that all this bad stuff is happening nearly game wide, and they really should do the right thing, issue an apology and make it right by their customer base affected with this and comp us as such. I know it's $15 a MONTH, but hey...I just gave them 50 cents and many hours of wasted time where I couldn't do a damn thing. How is that good service? will blizzard ever not screw up a launch day/week?</div></div><hr />

Not really. With SAN technology and virtualization, it's not that expensive or as time consuming as it used to be. Plus, all large companies take advantage of a huge technology refresh tax break every 3 years, so it's in their best interest to upgrade at that time, and all of them do.</div></div><hr />

It's having to handle both the login flood and the DDOS carpetbombings, that is causing the issues - they were anticipating the server-load from the logins, but the logins plus the DDOSing is what's straining them.<br />

They have had these problems for 5 expansions now. They KNOW that this happens every single time they launch an expansion or new content patch. They have had PLENTY of time to buy more hardware prior to launch of WoD so that the launch would be smooth and yet they were too cheap to do so (using the line that if they bought what they needed, they would sit unused after a month). I dont care. They make billions a year and can afford it. They can use them every 2 years when they have a new launch, or repurpose them for other game launches like D3, HoTS, or Overwatch when it comes out. ALL their games suffer from these issues at launch. We re paying for a game that we cant play. Its not a F2P game where you can just say deal with it, you arent paying for it anyway</div></div><hr />
