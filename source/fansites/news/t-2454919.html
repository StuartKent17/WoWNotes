Nono. Jaina is the final boss for both factions. Alliance just experience it from the Horde's PoV. Think kinda like Caverns of Time.</div></div><hr />

Alliance will fight Jaina (and the other 2 'horde side' bosses) too.. they'll be transformed into horde races for those fights</div></div><hr />

fyi the island expedition mounts are a pain in the ass to get. I've ran a couple hundred and no mounts, and have known folks who have done way more than me without any. You could spend 2 hours flipping burgers to buy that bat vs the ridiculous time sink to get even 1 isle mount - even more if you're targeting a SPECIFIC mount.</div></div><hr />

Pretty bland and boring mounts. Goes well with BFA . I like the Frog mount, But I will not pay that much gold for one. Should have been able to get this via a drop . Way to go</div></div><hr />

Actually, catering to their main player base, the casual players, would be pretty smart. Wow dying is inevitable, holding on to as many players for as long as possible would be a smart business plan. And so far this expansion seems to be a hit with the casuals so I don't think they have anything to worry about, don't be such a drama queen.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Catering to the casual player base is actually a terrible long term strategy as it neither draws new players in nor fosters long term growth. WoW has been catering to the casual player base since the end of WotLK and look where we are now.</div></div><hr />

casual players are the best long term stragedy.. those who call them self hardcore raiders is just a fraction of the player base and blizzard would hardly notice it if they all quit playing wow.. but if all the casuals left the game it would kill it, it's the casual players that have been keeping this game alive for years.. they buy items in the store.. they buy game service, tokens.</div></div><hr />

Token prices have never been what they were before and their value is suspiciously stuck at very low amounts (trust the system?) so I can only guess that Blizz wants me to buy three tokens ($60) for each mount color. If I 'only' invested two hours each day farming (repeating the same task), how long would it take for me to get 1M gold to use for this? Hard to imagine that this is what Blizz wants me to play the game or if I should just leave stuff like this for others that found ways to make money doing carries and such.</div></div><hr />

What do you mean by 'real progression'? As in raid mounts like the Jaina one or a grind like 'x amount of currency'? I was hoping there would be a new raid mount drop, looks like I've got my wish. Looks really nice aswell imo.</div></div><hr />

On the contrary I think casual players are less likely to be the ones buying stuff in the store and investing extra in a game that they only occasionally play. Also, you underestimate the fact that even casual players will lose interest if they're not enjoying the gameplay. Casual doesn't mean you accept everything without question.<br />
<br />
People always say casual players are the bulk of wow's playerbase, but in my experience the bulk of players are a step above casual... perhaps semi-casual or mediumcore, with an interest in progressing beyond mundane/trivial content, but not necessarily an interest in high M+ or mythic raiding. Your average joe player. Has a moderate item level of around 360-365, a few alts, killed some early heroic raid bosses, possibly cleared normal depending on the guild they're in, done some lower M+ keys. This category of player arguably outnumbers your super duper casual who is nervous about touching even a base mythic and hasn't stepped beyond LFR.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Guess you underestimate the casual players, those are the players that have money and dont hestitate buying things from the store and game services. For casuals beying scared of mythic, thing is there is alot of players that hold no interest in beying stuck in raid for 3-4 hours. We value our time more than that, but sure if i had no life and no friends i guess i would be raining like the rest... I Just dont see any value in raining. I have been casually playing wow for 10 year. Little as no raining, but still i spend alot more money in this game than you do and thats most likely because i have a job,, play few hours a week, i boost all my chars and pay $60 each time, buy tokens, buy items off ah and buy more tokens, if i need 1m gold i Just buy tokens so yes blizzard is getting Cash from casual players, Hardcore players farm everything and most likely never buy tokens or services With Cash... And dont tell me that Just players buy tokens, im sure blizzard is buying them off ah also, all tokens i have sold always sell at the same time during the everytime i sold one. I think in past 2 months i spend 300 euros on wow and everyone im playing With are casuals that also are buying boosts and tokens and only play few hours a week, biggest income blizzard has is services and ingame store, they lean on casuals that have money and pay subscription all year around even they dont play.</div></div><hr />

It still doesn't make sense for Mekkatorque to drop it. Because there's no sense why Mekkatorque would have it in the first place. That'd be light fighting Garrosh back in MoP and he'd drop a horse mount named &quot;Varian's Warhorse&quot; with Stormwind armor on it. As a Horde player.

Don't compare gear models, that are likely to be given to random mobs through an algorythm, with mounts. Especially unique mounts that drop from bosses (possibly mythic-only too).</div></div><hr />

You are correct. Some companies looked at the crying tears of hardcore fans and tried to make a game to cater to them thinking that was what people wanted but in reality hardcore fans made up the minority and games like Wildstar are dead because of it. You have to cater to casual fans as well because they make up the majority of everything. It sucks for super hardcore fans as quality can suffer but that's the way it is.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If we are at the lowest sub count it's because this game is old as fuck. It's pretty damn hard to draw new people into a 14 year old game, and veteran players drop all the time because wtf am I doing with my life still playing this old ass game. Casuals account for the masses. Neglect them and this game really will die.</div></div><hr />

He as well as anyone else pretending to know that the sub count is &quot;the lowest evah!&quot; or &quot;teh highest evah!&quot; are just being morons for a sport.<br />
<br />
We had such bright minds professing to know the REAL sub numbers even when Blizzard did report sub counts. &quot;12 million? Lol shady practice inflation of numbers fosho coz I don't enjoy teh gaem!&quot;...</div></div><hr />

Tbf, this game manages to hold the sub from people seemingly incapable of enjoying it for years on end, so wouldn't surprise me at all.<br />
<br />
That being said, nothing ever pleased everyone. <br />
I just wish they'd stop tip-toeing around it and visually update all the racial mounts already.</div></div><hr />

Only complaints I have, is that we get the store bat. At least give it armor. And that those frog mounts I really wanted, I'll never be able to afford.</div></div><hr />

Bring back meaningful stuff into the game not X Y Z additions. Make repetitive content fun (so much wasted potential with Warfronts jesus). Imagine if they could have done a DOTA type of map and how much replayability that would have had.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MouseD</div><div class="date">2018-12-10, 03:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">With missions only giving like 100G and repairs/mats costing way more than that, where does the gold come from to buy a 333K gold mount, and three of them? Token prices have never been what they were before and their value is suspiciously stuck at very low amounts (trust the system?) so I can only guess that Blizz wants me to buy three tokens ($60) for each mount color. If I 'only' invested two hours each day farming (repeating the same task), how long would it take for me to get 1M gold to use for this? Hard to imagine that this is what Blizz wants me to play the game or if I should just leave stuff like this for others that found ways to make money doing carries and such.<br />
<br />
Should of made your millions back with WoD and Legion...alts were very important during those expansions...I was making on avg 25K+ a week with missions....I also made over 2.25 million just off a certain battle pet that came out in Legion aka the Sun Darter Hatchling...</div></div><hr />
