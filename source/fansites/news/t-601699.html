Keep in mind that they won't be available until the season 3, and it's merely a way to keep everyone geared at a decent level I guess.</div></div><hr />

Yea color didn't change much in the t2 arena sets as it did with t1 arena where pve gear was easily recognizable. Well at least for warriors.</div></div><hr />

Crap or not, set #2 is in fact better by stats alone. Though the difference from 1 to 2 isnt much, with the exception or 993 more armor, it is nonetheless a difference.</div></div><hr />

They're removing the extra armor (which is really crap, whoever says otherwise doesn't play a mage often enough), and adding more int :-D (I'll post the thing ehre if I run into it again)</div></div><hr />

Well if they only allowed you to use arena gear in arena, then I would totally agree with you. But, as much as it hurts me to say, I do think its silightly unblanced to be able to go into a BG wearing full S2 gear and absolutly pwn everything in sight. The fact is that the current BG pvp gear sucks. They need to improve it and this is a logical way to do it and to keep it where Arena gear is still superior, but not outrageously so. There are a lot of people who dont arena but who still want to have fun in BG's, they should be able to have an avenue to be somewhat competitive against the big influx of arena peeps in BG's.</div></div><hr />
