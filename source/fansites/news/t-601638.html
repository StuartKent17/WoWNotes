They better not let us Kill Arthas.....maybe bring him to 90% and then he'll say something like: &quot;Ha, you weaklings..You can't stand my magnificent Power&quot; And then he gets like a hearthattack cos he isnt used to having so much power and then he retreats with saying: &quot;I'll let u live for now, go and watch the Wrath of the Lich king fold this world in Darkness &quot;<br />
<br />
Or maybe let us bring him to 50% ad that the Dragonflights do the rest....Anything but Us killing him....He's tooo awesome....<br />

<br />
Indeed, current info on Northrend zones from WoWWiki suggests an underground zone, an icy tundra, a frozen island, a crystal forest, a barren dragon-graveyard, a hilly region full of furbolg, a zone based around a bay which is presumably icy, a glacier where Arthas resides. a tropical jungle, a mountainous region with vicious winds and a troll-infested region. So some icy, not all icy. I'm sure Blizzard will find a way to differentiate between icy zones anyway.</div></div><hr />

Yes!!! I asked blizz to do that as a mean to take my revenge as a fire mage from the MC days! Eat it Icecube lover! Eat it goooooooooooood! Frozen elementals all over, and frost ghouls, and frost gnomes (admit it, you like to kill gnomes, who cars where they're from), and a LOT of ice trolls with 999 resist to frost FTW!!!!<br />

Well, I didn't knew that you were posting news exclusively for yourself, considering you don't want to give up your source. That's actually fine, but then you shouldn't be surprised that people with brain treating such information as speculation. Oh, and it will be funny if Blizz spent some of these millions, to strenghten their security and registered couple bogus trademarks.<br />

Certainly I enjoy the site and the news posted here but going as far as calling Boub. an idol of mine is quite off, sure he runs a great site and post interesting news on it but I save the idol seats for people I actually know :P<br />
<br />
I was simply agreeing with the news posted, I believed Northred was going to be the upcomming patch and, when the 'evidence' was presented for it, that the name was going to be &quot;Wrath of the Litch King&quot;.<br />
<br />
I do not belive Boub. would have posted totally inaccurate news with no grounds what so ever since that would, certainly, harm his credibility in future news, he did aswell (as far as I remember) write in the news that this was not 100% confirmed news and for everyone to belive or not to belive.<br />

<br />
<br />
tbh, my exact thought was &quot;if you don't want to give up your source, don't expect everyone to believe you&quot;, sorry that I expressed it in kinda evil / sarcastic way.<br />
<br />
I don't know, maybe Boubou saw that forbidden 'wrath' folder, and some naaru immediately /w him - It's &quot;Wrath of the Lich King&quot;, go build an ark.. err, anyway, while I agree there is that 'wrath' folder, &quot;wrath of the lich king&quot; was just one of many possibilities. Only now, when tm is registered, I give up. Almost. Considering last year, blizz knew what to expect, so I won't be surprised at all, if this folder was setup to give us a hint, then leaked full name on german site, and removed it to make it look more realistic, and finally TMs. I cannot even begin to imagine what kind of reaction will be tomorrow if new expansion name is actually something else.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Juju</div><div class="date">2007-08-02, 03:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Blizzard is known to have rather exelent marketing practices, leaking is definitly a good way to promote something without spending a lot of money to advertise a product within a already-interested community. That's what leaking is all about, they're happy about it, we're happy about it. Then they usually promote it big time when it's leaked (which nowadays in a community like WoW takes only a few hours max) and show it to the world to make everyone happy and get out-of-the-community people's attention on it :-)<br />
<br />
Boubouille running into it, means he knows where to look or has a source of some sort (which in both cases is good news, as it means this site is rather reliable compared to many many other ones). Of course it's always a speculation untill the source company announces it officially (technically).</div></div><hr />

Sure, thats why they're spending tons of money on Blizzcon, to promote their products.<br />
<br />
I have to admit, leaking and viral marketing is definitely good ways to draw attention, however a lot of people griefing on it, and WoW btw is brightest example. Needless to say that false info leads to frustration, frustration leads to anger,.. do I need to continue?<br />
<br />
Anyway, I'm not saying that leak means nothing. I actually believe that first blood elves screenshots and few howling fjord models around 2.1.0 were intentionally leaked, but in first case it was real pictures, and I saw howling fjord files with my own eyes, meantime right now, all we have is few links here and there which provide only text info.</div></div><hr />

<br />
if a leak is fake (and on purpose, you do have real leaks that are not controlled), what the company reveals after is usually even better, and people drop their jaws in awe...<br />
This leak happens too close to BlizzCon to be a fake IMO.<br />
As for why the spend millions on BlizzCon after saving on Leaking, it's simply because leaking catches the eye, and the release blinds it with amazing beauties :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
Besides, Blizzard wouldn't be banning people for discussing something they intended as viral marketing, infact if anyone has leaked any information my guess is that he's going to be without a job very soon.<br />
<br />
Starcraft 2 itself was pretty well kept a secret, up until 12 hours before the release, which again might just be a person seeing the obvious connection between Medusa and Kerrigan and deciding that speculation = truth and as such he have to act the &quot;secret blizzard guy&quot;.<br />
<br />
This is however different since we now have several official sources telling us that Blizzard have something called &quot;Wrath of the Lich King&quot;, you could of course claim that it's all an elaborate scheme to throw us off the scent, but regardless it is STUPID to flat out deny the fact that this is what people have found out.</div></div><hr />
