Plans for Alliance Leadership<br />
Yes, there are plans. There are always plans. But, don't worry. I think you're going to see some things happen &quot;in the future&quot; for the Alliance and their leadership. We are trying to do what we can to make sure that it will all be as accessible as possible too (storyline wise.)

Death Knight Starting Gear for Transmogrification<br />
Okay, so, for clarification's sake, they'll be sold in Acherus, but, like most of its denizens, the vendor doesn't like non-DKs.<br />
<br />
We've been pretty relaxed and playful about staying on topic in this thread, but I'm kind of reluctant to flip the serious switch and make this all about Blood tanking. There are changes coming, but I'm not in a position to discuss them just yet.<br />
<br />
So, while I don't have a lot in the way of specifics to report, a little more information should be coming soon (likely in the form of a blog) regarding changes to Blood tanking, as well as tanking in general, and that information should hit before the patch arrives. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/194611/blizz-please-let-us-buy) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/3082079632?page=6#102))<br />

Character Model Updates<br />
As I said previously, we're aware. Just remember, being aware neither means that we don't want to do it, nor does it mean it's a sure thing. It just means we know. We agree (as I mentioned before) that it would be great to do. We just need to figure out how and when we can do it. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/193101/orcs-need-model-buffed) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/3077927869?page=15#299))<br />

Replica armors from new Darkmoon Faire<br />
We haven't fully solidified the list of old items/sets that will make a return via the Darkmoon Faire carnies. We'll let you know once we've locked down what's for sale there in patch 4.3, but yes, we're likely to expand the vendor list in future updates.<br />
<br />
&quot;Replica&quot; does mean that these items may very well just be art skins made available specifically for use with Transmogrification, devoid of their original stats. Once you copy those skins onto another item though, I don't know that one would be able to tell the difference between whether you earned the look back in the day, or from the Darkmoon Faire. Only the name of the item from which you're pulling art will be shown in the tooltip of the item you have equipped. So if the names of the items aren't changed when placed on Darkmoon Faire vendors, a player inspecting you wouldn't know the difference once you've mogged your look.<br />
<br />
[...] we're implementing this feature in a more conservative manner than some would even like. Ultimately, Transmogrification gives folks a wide array of new customization options, but we do want to have some restrictions in place to keep character looks from getting too ridiculous, and to make sure all previous sets in the game aren't absolutely free for all.<br />
<br />
I'd still caution you to avoid drawing very distinct and speculative conclusions at this stage about all of the Transmogrification rule sets, features, and limitations. It's great to hear feedback on what players hope this system will (or will not) be, but it's not really worth it for anyone to spend too much time laying out concerns about details that haven't yet been provided in full.<br />
<br />
We are in constant discussion with our developers in order that we compile a comprehensive article of the various item rules, features, and restrictions coming with Transmogrification in patch 4.3. <br />
<br />
&quot;I got this item a long time ago and because I did, I should be unique and special and nobody else should ever be able to get it again&quot;.<br />
And one of the problems I personally have with anyone who might state this hypothetical, is that I did earn several cool sets back in the day which I'd love to sport once again. But as we didn't plan for this feature all along, I deleted sets I knew I'd never wear for stat benefits in order to save inventory space. I told myself, &quot;yes, you look cool in this, but don't be a pack rat if you're not going to wander around towns in outmoded sets.&quot; I wager a lot of long-time WoW players are in the same boat. And a deleted/sold item is only kept in our database logs for so long before the record of one having owned that item is erased.<br />
<br />
The majority of the gear sets in this game are still possible to obtain, so that's awesome. To me it's a cool side effect of this feature to encourage people to return to some old places, filled with nostalgia, to collect gear just for the look -- not the power.<br />
<br />
There are, however, some sets or items which can no longer be found in the game. So we're keeping track of some of the items and sets players are really wanting to see make a return in some fashion. The Darkmoon Faire revamp in patch 4.3 provides but one new way players can slip into familiar looks from the past. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/194423/replica-armors-from-new-darkmoon-faire-q) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/3082208862?page=2#27))<br />
<br />
Transmogrification rather than content?<br />
I've seen a lot of these sorts of overstatements or oversimplifications of the work that we're doing on our end of things and I have to honestly say that it can get a bit tiring to see repeated as fact when it's opinion. While we greatly appreciate constructive feedback and opinion, we also want to make sure to encourage people to pause and make sure that what they're sharing with us and the rest of the community is constructive to begin with.<br />
<br />
Let's start off first by clarifying that Transmogrification is a feature we felt would benefit the community in many ways. It should open up the opportunity for people to feel as if they have the ability to customize how their character looks while still retaining the stats they really like, want, or need. It is as of yet, untested on the PTR, but it will be. The &quot;rules&quot; of what can and can't be used are still in development, and even after the rules are set at the live release, we may well add additional options into the system. This system should lend itself well to long term use and enjoyment for many people. <br />
<br />
That said though, (and yes we did have to spend time on the technical end of things to make sure it is going to work well), we are also working on other things including the Void Storage, but more importantly, are working on some pretty amazing content for patch 4.3 which includes new dungeons and the Raid on Deathwing. We're not quite ready to give you all the details on these as of yet, but I can tell you that we're looking at some pretty great storylines and events to be played out. I can assure you that despite what your perception may be, Firelands was not designed by simply plopping down bosses in a field of fire, nor is anything we design quite so simple. If it was, we'd probably all get more sleep and spend more time on the company yacht. Right?<br />
<br />
I'm sure your perception is that our only focus is Transmogrification because you've only seen us really getting into the details on it recently and it's been a hot topic for the community overall. But don't be fooled into thinking that the content to come is going to be a simple paper cut out puppet show in a cardboard box. <br />
<br />
Again, please don't take this as me disregarding your opinion or thoughts. Just be reassured though that we're not &quot;just&quot; doing anything in regard to the upcoming content. There has been many many hours of work put into what is coming: many meetings, many strategy sessions, much design work, coding, artwork, music, animation, etc. If we make it look &quot;easy&quot; then I guess there's not much we can do about that. We have some truly talented and amazing people working on these things, so I guess we just can't help making it look that way.<br />
<br />
[...] Unfortunately, we can't just put out foggers to kill bugs, but I can assure you that we don't choose to not fix bugs just for the heck of it. Some bugs are just harder to kill/fix than others or rely on even new technology to sort them out. Sometimes a bug is even darn near impossible to reproduce even if we've seen it ourselves. Thus why we're always very appreciative of the community taking time to report these to us (with as much detail as possible) so we can find and fix them.<br />
<br />
That said though, that quest is never ending. World of Warcraft is a very complex game and what was fixed one moment could get glitched out again the next if a build changes or code changes. We do what we can do stay on top of it, but unfortunately, we have human limitations that get in the way despite the introduction of our new cyber-enhancement program. (It's fledgling yet so there may be bugs in that system too... (Ok, I'm kidding about cyber-enhancements)).<br />
<br />
[...] I'll continue it and say, it's also tiring hearing that we're not addressing things in a 'satisfactory manner'. Not because we don't want to put in the effort or that we're giving up on trying, it's just that when the effort is put in, it's not enough for select people. Of course it's that way because we have such a diverse population (which is great) so we're never going to address everything to everyone's satisfaction.<br />
<br />
That said though, I wanted to make sure you know that I appreciate you taking the time to write your post. I appreciate the constructive feedback and also wanted to acknowledge that we are well aware of the feeling that we're not delivering content fast enough. We are continuing to find ways to do just this. Just keep in mind that we do not want (nor are choosing to) deliver anything that isn't up to our standards. So, we still will hold to the idea that if we feel something isn't good enough or isn't working how we wanted it to, we will not put it out there just so we can say we did.

Sure it will be easier to earn nowadays than it was back in the day, but the same applies to any of the content which due to the resulting inflation from level people are running with considerably less than the originally intended numbers, if not soloing.<br />
The skill or effort requirement is removed from practically all still available tier sets, so why not.<br />
The timing of when someone started playing, or how frequently they played should not deny them something just for that reason.</div></div><hr />

Sure it will be easier to earn nowadays than it was back in the day, but the same applies to any of the content which due to the resulting inflation from level people are running with considerably less than the originally intended numbers, if not soloing.<br />
The skill or effort requirement is removed from practically all still available tier sets, so why not.<br />
The timing of when someone started playing, or how frequently they played should not deny them something just for that reason.<br />
<br />
Well said. I couldn't agree more :)</div></div><hr />

No Inyu this is Murkablo, Deathy is a previous model. We scrapped Deathy, Murkablo has more Torque, better mileage, and he's environmentally friendly. Don't be fooled, this is an entirely different animal we're talking about here. This is apples and oranges you're comparing here Inyu.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Because in my &gt;OPINION&lt; 4.3 sounds like a pretty massive patch. Of course, I don't remember what patch 3.3 had other than ICC and three new dungeons, but 4.3 has that, plus Transmogging, plus Void Storage, plus Raid Finder, plus huge Darkmoon Faire updates (which almost sounds like a new time-locked miniature zone by the preview).<br />

I have raided all of the content since vanilla and all the expansions on a warrior and on a hunter. And never had the bag space to keep all of my old tier so I have had to toss it since wrath, so I welcome this with open arms.</div></div><hr />

Once you copy those skins onto another item though, I don't know that one would be able to tell the difference between whether you earned the look back in the day, or from the Darkmoon Faire. Only the name of the item from which you're pulling art will be shown in the tooltip of the item you have equipped. So if the names of the items aren't changed when placed on Darkmoon Faire vendors, a player inspecting you wouldn't know the difference once you've mogged your look. Does this mean that inspect addons such as GearScore and Simple Ilevel cannot check your real gear? You could potentially have blue gear, buy Tier X gear, transmogrify the blue gear to look like the Tiergear, sell it for full refund and keep doing it for all the JP/VP slots?

The ilvl and stats remain the same but the name changes.<br />
<br />
I guess you want an opportunity to check what the &quot;real&quot; piece is called, but what would be the point when you still see the original stats..?<br />
<br />
Also I think it's safe to assume you can't transmogrify lower ilvl blue to higher ilvl epic, could be wrong though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've noticed no matter how &quot;awesome&quot; they say these new dungeons will be... or the raid for that matter. I just cant seem to get the thought of &quot;yeah.... like we havent heard that before and it be nothing but a lie&quot; out of my mind. For some reason.... i just cant bring myself to believe the new dungeons will be awesome, or great, or anything &quot;new&quot;. I can't help but feel that it'll probably be just like the rest of the cata dungeons. 0 room for failure, 200 instant kill mechanics, while at the same time cobbling boss mechanics from 20 other fights and i just cant see myself rejoining the LFD tool on a regular basis. <br />

On another note; I think I just realized the reason behind why the art department doesnt have &quot;time&quot; to fix the character models and such...

This is also for players who originally ran that content, but later didnt have the bank space to keep it all. it happens. So how would you or anyone else know the difference between someone who got it for what you consider &quot;free&quot; and someone who worked hours on content 4 years ago but wasnt able to keep the set, because their bank filled with other sets and items the needed.<br />

So you'd rather have it everything ever introduced into wow was ultimately a limited time event to claim gear? That no one should have any fun ever? That because we don't do old content anymore or perhaps people never had the chance to farm or had bad luck farming, they don't get a chance to wear cool gear? Or that because they aren't the best of the best of the best from the best of the best at the start of wow, they don't deserve anything, because they're veterans? And that makes them more special and privileged?<br />
<br />

It's a GAME. It's meant to be fun for EVERYONE. Not a few idiots hopped up thinking their fifteen dollars are worth more than someone else's!<br />

She has B cups. Usually people like you who dont have talent are just jealous of the people who do.<br />

Why the hell should I have to have talent to be a critic of shitty art? And yes I have no skill, but I'm not jealous of people who can only draw children with boobs big boobs or anime kawaii desu style ololol. Or wearing things more skimpy than a string bikini. Seriously look at her proportioning. The TIGER looks more realistic than she does. She looks like a damn Tiara and Toddler star that got a boob job. Her arms/shoulders also don't look jointed to the body properly as well. She just looks all kinds of wrong.<br />

You don't need to be an artist to be a critic of it- because if you needed to be a something, to be a critic for anything, well, a whole lot of people would be out of jobs to satisfy the butthurt that you have because I dissed a picture you liked.</div></div><hr />

I agree with you. Blizz seems to have a thing for pseudo child porn though. I remember about a year ago they picked a picture of a scantily clad night elf girl that looked no older than 12 years old, with tits. Shame on Blizz for choosing this kinda stuff.</div></div><hr />

That would cause soooo much QQing it'd be insane. Thats like them being &quot;here is your scorchling pet!&quot; a year later &quot;we are removing it and making it cost 20 bucks!!!&quot; That would not go over well at all.</div></div><hr />

Customizing the look of your character, or as blizzard calls it &quot;transmogrification&quot; has been around for years. IMHO there just ripping off one of the best parts of Guild Wars in order to $$$, and its lonnnng over do considering there the biggest MMO on the market. It's a smart move, very much over do, and it will require months if not years of patch's to even come close to Guild Wars but smart move in general.</div></div><hr />

And yes I have no skill, but I'm not jealous of people who can only draw children with boobs big boobs or anime kawaii desu style ololol. Or wearing things more skimpy than a string bikini. Seriously look at her proportioning. The TIGER looks more realistic than she does. She looks like a damn Tiara and Toddler star that got a boob job. Her arms/shoulders also don't look jointed to the body properly as well. She just looks all kinds of wrong.<br />
<br />
And as with most of the other art depicting females? It's all wonky, fanservicy or animedesu or a combination of them all. There have been some gems that have been good, I particularly loved that Dryad archer picture, but alot? Yeah, just crap imo.<br />
<br />
<br />
You don't need to be an artist to be a critic of it- because if you needed to be a something, to be a critic for anything, well, a whole lot of people would be out of jobs to satisfy the butthurt that you have because I dissed a picture you liked.<br />
<br />
I love the &quot;it's a GAME&quot;. Nobody should care about others, but these &quot;others&quot; should care about having the same thing as the ppl who shouldn't care about in 1st place.<br />
<br />
Weird huh? Should work for both who have something before and who wants that same thing after... &quot;you can't get it today, don't QQ and order Blizz to give it to you because you pay for it, it's just a game&quot;.</div></div><hr />

I was thinking the same the animations look identical and it's almost the same color scheme... I don't know I'm a lil upset by this since I went to Blizzcon last year and am going again this year, kinda a redundant pet. Mini Diablo still owns all.</div></div><hr />
