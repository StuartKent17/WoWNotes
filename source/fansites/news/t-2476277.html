<br />
<br />
General Philosophy<br />
<br />
There is still no exact date when 8.2 will be on the PTR, but Ion says &quot;not too long after this, we're going to have a large info dump for the community and (public test realm) for Rise of Azshara will start.&quot;<br />
8.2 is a &quot;very large content patch.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Nazjatar<br />
<br />
8.2 will take the best features of past endgame content, but is also trying a lot of new things.<br />
The team doesn't just want Nazjatar to feel like a familiar formula applied to a new set of terrain, but an actual meaningful different game experience from the past few months.<br />
<br />
<br />
Azerite System<br />
<br />
Having to re-earn your traits as you get better gear is not fun and something they want to completely move away from.<br />
8.2 will continue to have new Azerite traits unique to Azshara's raid or to Mechagon that compliment the existing pool of traits.<br />
Traits will be fully unlocked and players can choose their talents that best fits their play style.<br />
The Heart of Azeroth will continue to use Azerite Power for a progression path on the Heart itself that consists of both passive and active traits.<br />
Active abilities will be actual new spells that are placed on the hotbar and have a meaningful change to your combat rotation immediately.<br />
Addressing the core system of Azerite Armor was something Tides of Vengeance couldn't do, and so the team added the 5th ring and more customization while they worked on the new system for the past couple months.<br />
<br />
<br />
Future Expansion Feature Design<br />
<br />
The team learned a lot about the importance of player agency.<br />
The Azerite System was designed to respond to the failings of Legion Artifacts in which the customization was very frontloaded.<br />
They feel that having all traits unlocked on Legion weapons, not having any big choices, and being the same as every other person of your class was a missed opportunity to give players more choice.<br />
One of their biggest mistakes in the BfA beta was waiting too long to get the Azerite Armor and traits fully stood up in the beta.<br />
Going forward, the team is going to have a much higher priority on getting end game gear progression into the player's hand in the early stages of the alpha and beta tests.<br />
<br />
<br />
Portal Removal<br />
<br />
The team has to find a middle ground between many different play styles.<br />
Flying is a good example. They had one extreme of getting it early for gold, the other of not having it at all, and ultimately settled on a method that they feel is a nice middle ground.<br />
The team wanted to consolidate portals into something that was more intuitive and made more sense within the world. They didn't want players having to place their Hearthstone in old expansion content because it was the most accessible area.<br />
Feedback is what caused Caverns of Time to be added to the portal rooms in 8.2<br />
<br />
<br />
Change and Player Reactions<br />
<br />
The team sometimes makes changes that seem less fun because they've been burned in the past and are worried about some consequence three years down the line.<br />
A lot of the current gear progression systems were designed as expansion only features, and the team wants to be more open to implementing permanent RPG additions to the game and accepting that there will be some untidiness down the road as long as it's exciting for players.</div></div><hr />

LOL. The endless cycle of &quot;we learned&quot; blah blah. They only things they EVER LEARN is just how much they can get away with with the customers they have left.<br />

They have learned it is &quot;a lot&quot; and therefore act like passive aggressive jackasses to their customers when they have the audacity to not love everything the devs shit out.</div></div><hr />

Isn't it a good thing, that people are always learning new stuff? It usually leads to innovation. Sticking to the same tried and true will inevitably lead to downfall.</div></div><hr />

Just through the normal process of time teams change as people leave and others replace them. And the playerbase is changing too. What was once welcomed may no longer be even accepted.<br />

I think it's great they're actually saying these things.</div></div><hr />

This.<br />
<br />
They always say they do. And they never actually do learn lol. Or they only just find out that players are sick of the state of the game at the end of an expansion. Which is when it's too late as most players have already left BFA now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This was a very good interview. I'm glad they acknowledged that Azerite armor deserved more testing and that new permanent additions to classes are in need. The only point of contention I had was the line:<br />
<br />
<br />
But there's a lot of fun customization in armor pieces for the Azerite System, but having to re-earn access to those traits whenever you get to a new tier of gear, that's something that we've heard a lot of negative feedback about from players and it's something that we want to move completely away from.<br />
<br />
I just can't agree. Random damage/healing procs that I have no control over and don't affect gameplay aren't fun customization options, especially when so many of them were class immersion breaking. Squirting water out of my rogue's shoulders at my enemies is not fun, interesting, or immersive. Legion legos are a better example of fun customization options, at least once you had all of them.</div></div><hr />

Oh boo hoo Ion playing the victim card yet again.....<br />
<br />
The team has to find a middle ground between many different play styles.<br />
<br />
ARE YOU KIDDING? You are bringing fucking play styles in over a matter of simple convenience?<br />
<br />
Yes I'm sure this portal being taken away impacts my play style of how I raid or PvP.... No it just means I have to spend more time getting somewhere. Simple as that.<br />
<br />

<br />
&quot;Extreme&quot;. Jesus this dev team is 100% out of touch with it's community. It's actually pitiful now. It's funny how FF14 simply just has you explore the zone and do the MSQ to be able to fly in that zone basically and yet ActiBlizz can't find a simple middle ground for a convenience feature?</div></div><hr />

Unless you're the WoW Classic team, the only team the community is happy with right now because they at least are listening to feedback. Which is just bonkers. You'd think they weren't the same company. lol.</div></div><hr />

- the next patch is going to be great, so much unique content<br />
- we want players to have fun<br />

<br />
LMAO. Taking away something from people wanting to use it, because people who didnt want to use it would rather bitch about it than stop using it, is now a middle ground. I guess the rich milking most of the money from the poor is a middle ground too. We have one extreme of rich having all the money in the world, or the other one of taking all the money from the rich and giving it to the poor. But we, geniuses, thought about the middle ground: let have the rich own only 90% of the money, that way both sides will be happy right?</div></div><hr />

I think the pathfinder system is pretty good for current expansions. Once we transition to a new expansion though I think they should bring back a gold cost option. Say someone started playing in Legion and wanted to go do some WoD dungeons for transmog, they could have the option of investing time into unlocking flying to make the dungeons easier to visit or they could throw a big chunk of gold at a vendor. They could even incentivise going back for old pathfinder achieves more by making the vendor flying character specific so you'd either be buying flying for each character or just doing pathfinder to unlock it for all your characters.<br />
<br />
For current expansion, pathfinder is super easy to do with normal play. I've never had a problem with it. I've had a good number of guildies who needed to get rides places because we were doing a fun run somewhere old and they weren't playing when that content was current for one reason or another. I say once it's old content the necessity for the barrier goes away.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To be honest, no one really.<br />
Fun is subjective and even if half the playerbase likes it the other won't.<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyways, there will be multiple traits that you can choose from, if you dont like one just choose another that you find fun.</div></div><hr />

we do want active traits.<br />
as long as they are fun that is.<br />
<br />
That really depends. If you go back to artifact weapons, there was basically one added active ability trait, the rest were pretty much passives/procs. That's not to say it's bad, as some of those traits really did change your rotation or how you played or made certain spells more impactful/eaningful. I find that fun, and some Azerite traits did allow this. If Blizz is going to start adding a bunch of extra buttons to push, they run the risk of adding too many buttons to press just to have buttons to press... as well as the potential balancing nightmare that would ensue. Even if everyone had the same generic buttons to press, their effects and power would still vary greatly among classes depending upon their interactions.<br />
<br />
What I'd really hope for is either adding one active ability with a bunch of supporting passives/procs that either tie into said ability or baseline spec abilities (Legion artifact model), or to only be able to choose one active ability out of a few depending upon what you want. I'd be willing to let Blizz put more than 5 seconds of thought into this like I have and wow me (excuse the pun) with a new, innovative, and fun system.<br />
<br />
Slight aside, anyone else notice we're doing Legion in reverse here? Relic traits are basically was Azerite armor is, and this new HoA system appears like it'll be similar to the Legion artifact weapons.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Extreme&quot;. Jesus this dev team is 100% out of touch with it's community. It's actually pitiful now. It's funny how FF14 simply just has you explore the zone and do the MSQ to be able to fly in that zone basically and yet ActiBlizz can't find a simple middle ground for a convenience feature?<br />
<br />
Seems like a clear extreme to me, 1 was zero effort buying it with minuscule amounts of gold. The other was not at all.<br />

Personally though i'd prob care more about getting flying faster in the absence of the flight whistle, decent FPS &amp; spud, pretty easy to get around.</div></div><hr />

EDIT: As for flying, I honestly don't see what the big deal is, compared to Legion traversing the two new islands is so easy, most of the territory is flat/hilly and there's flightpaths just about everywhere. Not to mention the boats to the opposing continents teleport you instantly and the flight path book works across all characters. <br />

NO NO NOOOOOO. We DON'T need active traits.<br />

And right here is exactly the problem with WoW (or rather the community). You are clearly upset at the idea of adding active abilities. Other people are extremely happy.

Man they could change everything and you would never be happy would you? Personally i like the pathfinder method, except that they wait way too long to add flying. Really they should add it in the first .1 patch that comes out. It is way too much of a pain in the ass to get around and level my other toons right now so i have been holding off until i can actually fly.</div></div><hr />

Oh god. I hate when they do this. Cause we get used to having them, then they get removed in the next expansion cause of Blizzards &quot;expansion only features&quot; philosophy.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The Azerite System was designed to respond to the failings of Legion Artifacts in which the customization was very frontloaded.<br />
They feel that having all traits unlocked on Legion weapons, not having any big choices, and being the same as every other person of your class was a missed opportunity to give players more choice.<br />
<br />
As long as things buff damage/healing/defense there is no such thing as choice. Everyone just uses what ever increases the performance of their role the most.</div></div><hr />

Exactly lol.<br />
<br />
FF14 works like this.<br />
<br />
15 Aether currents in a zone. 5 from the story and the other 10 you get from exploring the zone.<br />
<br />
Once you get those 15 you can fly. So it keeps you on the MSQ and encourages you to either explore while levelling or go back at 70 and do it when it's a bit less hassle.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile in WoW it's literally wait a year. Nothing else. Just wait a year and then the next bit of the timegate comes out.</div></div><hr />

Would love to see your stats on that majority claim, but anyways, the alternative that they wanted was removing flying completely, which would be terrible in my opinion. Like i said i personally would rather only see it gated by maybe 4 - 6 months, just enough time for people to do the content and get settled in before letting them have the convenience. A year feels way too long for me.</div></div><hr />

The part of the community that desires flying, for the most part, would be ok with that.<br />
<br />
I'm part of the community that desires flying and is ok with working for it with the path finder achievement. I'm not OK with pathfinder taking months upon months to reach &quot;part two&quot;. Just have the bloody achievement implemented day one when an xpac launches and those who want to work for it can and be happy when they're done. it's not that hard.<br />
<br />
I'm also going to throw this out there and get hated on for even mentioning it. I am honestly surprised that unlocking flight hasn't moved to the in game shop.<br />
<br />
The only thing Blizzard (shareholders and business side) seems to care about, at all, is profit. I truly believe that they stopped caring about the player base the minute they realized how much money was in the micro transaction side of things. Realizing they could not only milk us for money through monthly subs but now through micro transactions must have given them one hell of a chubby.</div></div><hr />

I enjoy what they give me just fine so far, the expansions have all been worth the box price and a few months subscription based on the time and enjoyment I get out of them. I play when I want to, and go play other things when I'm not enjoying myself. Blizz (and at least one other MMO company, SE) has stated they expect this kind of churn in subscriber numbers.<br />
<br />
They've run the game for almost 15 years at this point, they obviously have some idea on how to do it, better than most armchair developers posting on MMO-C at any rate. That doesn't make them perfect, nor infallible, just saying they know how to run their business and game to keep it operating. I have faith they'll do just fine going forward too.</div></div><hr />

They should have NEVER added flying mounts. Period. You do not understand the DISSERVICE the flying mount does. <br />

This game went from Exploring a world, to Flying point a-b thru a skybox. IF you think thats fun game play, id question your IQ.<br />

Guess what the classic community is happy about..No fucking flying. WHY? because of the perceived notion of exploration.<br />

The last game i can think of that had real exploration and flying was AION, and that game was built from the GROUND up to be a flying game.<br />

remove flying mounts, and add more &quot;endgame&quot; non raid content to the existing azeroth. Simple. UTILIZE what you have at your disposal</div></div><hr />

Need a portal, hey, actually TALK to people again and ask a mage. If you're to lazy to move your character in game i can only imagine how obese you are in real life. If you're to impenitent then again, go back to league of legends.<br />
<br />
&gt;hurrrr we need flying cause story sucks, questing sucks, game no fun<br />

No fucking way, they realize that now? A few thousand people said it on the forums during beta and anyone playing the game have figured that one out after getting a piece of gear that &quot;oh, i cant unlock it even tho it's higher ilvl, cant use that&quot; lol<br />
<br />
And all the &quot;we are learning from mistakes and making things better&quot; is their go-to phrase for the last 4 expac, you could find that sentence on every single interview they done, it's just PR stuff to make them look good.

<br />
They should have NEVER added flying mounts. Period. You do not understand the DISSERVICE the flying mount does. <br />
<br />
This game went from Exploring a world, to Flying point a-b thru a skybox. IF you think thats fun game play, id question your IQ.<br />
<br />
Guess what the classic community is happy about..No fucking flying. WHY? because of the perceived notion of exploration.<br />
<br />
The last game i can think of that had real exploration and flying was AION, and that game was built from the GROUND up to be a flying game.<br />
<br />
remove flying mounts, and add more &quot;endgame&quot; non raid content to the existing azeroth. Simple. UTILIZE what you have at your disposal<br />
<br />
Exploring a world gets really boring when you've already explored it. The reasons I will be playing classic will not be for the world and exploration. It was great the first time, but I've spent so many years in those same zones that exploring them again is just going to be a waste of time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This was a very good interview. I'm glad they acknowledged that Azerite armor deserved more testing and that new permanent additions to classes are in need. The only point of contention I had was the line:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I just can't agree. Random damage/healing procs that I have no control over and don't affect gameplay aren't fun customization options, especially when so many of them were class immersion breaking. Squirting water out of my rogue's shoulders at my enemies is not fun, interesting, or immersive. Legion legos are a better example of fun customization options, at least once you had all of them.<br />
<br />
you do know many legion legendaries and past teir sets were literally JUST THAT right?<br />
many past teir sets were literally just &quot;x does more damage&quot; or &quot;Y crits more often' or &quot;Z has chance to grant you haste&quot;<br />
<br />
that is literally what the game is about<br />
<br />

<br />
Failings of the Legion Artifact? WTF? The legion Artifact was amazing and it was good it was frontloaded. A person doing well was based on their ability to play their class. Now, its based on the gear combos they have, which is garbage.<br />
<br />
there was no actual customization in the legion artifacts, that was one of the failings plus you very quickly unlocked all the major traits, like 3 weeks ish, then you just got the infinite trait</div></div><hr />

<br />
NO NO NOOOOOO. We DON'T need active traits.<br />
<br />
This statement is directly contrary to what people were saying was bad about HoA vs Legion Artifacts. The majority of people seemed to like the addition of active traits that gave you a more direct impact to how you played back in Legion and hated that HoA is a stat stick that arbitrarily gives and denies passive traits on other armor slots based on level.</div></div><hr />

The funny thing is this is a list of how much customisation has been gutted from the game over the years. Or a good chunk at least.<br />
<br />
Enchants. Head, Shoulder, Legs, Gloves, Boots, Bracers and even Cloak. And even the Belt Buckle.<br />
<br />
Reforging. And a good chunk of decent stats to go with it. <br />

Sockets. Oh wait my bad they are part of the RNG Diablo 3 fiesta now. :rolleyes:<br />

Later on as the game matured more people came into possession enough gold to get flying without much of a hassle. I didn't get flying until wrath and I started playing during BC. Ultimately i wish they never added flying as it really killed exploring and seeing people.

i think you mean EPIC flying..<br />
normal flying was MUCH easier then 5000g<br />
literally EVERYONE had flying in TBC once they were able to get to the vendor for it (800g)<br />

Blizzard loves to do fun things, like give items effects, and have unique fights like the vehicle fights with lootship and flame leviathan.<br />
<br />
then people complain out the ass till blizz decides not to do those again.<br />
took all the way from wotlk to wod to try a vehicle fight again and again people complained...<br />

Well you currently have 3 choices - <br />
<br />
1) random drops from raid hoping you get the piece that has the traits you want (RNG)<br />
2) random spin for decent ilvl traits in a specific slot for low Residuum cost (RNG and a grindfest)<br />
3) specific gear with the traits you want (not RNG, but the amount of Residuum needed turns it into a major grindfest)<br />

1) so... like all raiding... the gear you get from the boss is random... sooo how is this unique to azerite gear? I wanted the ring from sindragosa and it took me like 9 weeks to get it... a boss dropping random loot is not new, thats a thing all the way back ot vanilla.<br />
2) if you want to take that RNG that is your choice, you dont need to use that gamble<br />
3) you mean about 5-8 weeks to get a GARUNTEED BIS OF YOUR CHOICE is somehow not good enough? <br />
<br />
If we went back to vanilla and were told &quot;do a thing for about 30 minutes a week, and in 5-8 weeks you will get an item you will not replace till next raid&quot; we would LOSE OUR SHIT in hype.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Scrod</div><div class="date">2019-04-03, 08:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Flying is a good example. They had one extreme of getting it early for gold, the other of not having it at all, and ultimately settled on a method that they feel is a nice middle ground. &lt;--- Bad e.g. The method you settled in effectively achieved what you wanted. Making it such a long grind, that a sizable no of players would not bother getting it, and rather quit the game. This is not a middle ground at all.<br />
<br />
Middle ground = worst of both worlds. I cannot imagine a strategy that could have divided and frustrated the playerbase more. It’s like they’re trying to push people away.<br />
<br />
Let’s review:<br />
<br />
Step 1: Fully embrace flying for years and release hundreds of flying mounts<br />
Step 2: Repudiate flying completely, irreparably dividing the playerbase<br />
Step 3: Announce flying is coming back!<br />
Step 4: Gate flying behind a terrible grind that makes sure you don’t get it until far into a patch<br />
Step 5: Release new patch, no flying!<br />
<br />
At this point it’s clear they view flying as a shiny thing that they can throw a grind in front of and hope that it convinces people to play a bit more (which is why it tends to appear during the mid expansion lull) but then they undercut the reward by releasing a new patch two months later with new content where flying is disabled.<br />
<br />
Sometimes it feels like they’re trying to drive the game into the ground.<br />
<br />
“Nice middle ground” - fuck off.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MrFiddleswitch</div><div class="date">2019-04-03, 09:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">1) so... like all raiding... the gear you get from the boss is random... sooo how is this unique to azerite gear? I wanted the ring from sindragosa and it took me like 9 weeks to get it... a boss dropping random loot is not new, thats a thing all the way back ot vanilla.<br />
2) if you want to take that RNG that is your choice, you dont need to use that gamble<br />
3) you mean about 5-8 weeks to get a GARUNTEED BIS OF YOUR CHOICE is somehow not good enough? <br />
<br />
<br />
Point 1 - valid point, you are correct here - it is the same as it always has been since vanilla in some ways. The exception here is the forced personal looting system in raids, which needs to be factored in. You 1) have to have your personal loot roll succeed on the boss that drops the piece you need and 2) then need it to be that piece. It's similar to previous expansions, sure, but that added level of RNG does make a difference (granted Tradiing does help a bit). Despite raiding Uldir every week from launch until BoD, I never actually received my BIS shoulders - that's poor design, regardless of if that same design existed in previous expansions.<br />
<br />
Point 2 - Also true, except my rebuttal for point 3<br />
<br />
Point 3 - Uldir lasted 20 weeks and as you said, it takes 5-8 weeks per piece for a BIS slot. At 8 weeks per piece (24 weeks), that is 4 weeks into the next raid before you have your BIS from the previous raid. Even at 5 weeks, you will only have your BIS for the last 5 weeks of farm for those 3 pieces. While it is an improvement from the original system, it still essentially means that the average player needs to depend on Option 2 vs. Option 3 if they actually want to get their BIS within a given Season, as the 5 weeks option requires a significant amount of playtime - more than the &quot;average&quot;.<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong - I do see your points and you have convinced me that perhaps it's not as bad as it seems any longer when you consider all the sources. I guess I'm still a bit too caught up in the 8.0 style. However, this doesn't take away from the fact that the new system in 8.2 is far superior by their description. Completely removing that aspect of RNG is a good idea IMO.</div></div><hr />

Really, it should just be if you get all the zone achievements for the story quests. That's seeing the content. Once you get that unlock Flying. End of story. You see the content on foot while doing the quests chains. When you finish the story, then you've seen the content and who cares if you skip it?<br />

This pathfinder garbage is just a tedious grind.<br />
<br />
Also seriously? Adding active abilities again? So that legion garbage? The stuff that they ended up adding as traits later because everyone became dependent on them? what, will it be random abilities per azerite? Or only on specific sets which then become must-gets because of the active ability?<br />

almost like time gating has always been a thing in the game.<br />

before they just released the patch 1 month later then it could have been, with the raid the day the patch went out<br />
instead of now where they release the patch when its ready, and the raid 1 month later.<br />
<br />
Ya of course I remember. Sorry for calling you an ape. As large as the content patch is, I don't know if the game will be any better. To me character progression is big and I'm hoping although the hope is very slim that the new azerite trait system is better.<br />

And I don't think they release patches or expansions when they are ready. Rather I think they have a deadline to meet given by activision that they have to meet.</div></div><hr />

I have to disagree. People constantly paint this false dichotomy between Classic and Retail. But there are many people like myself who will play both. And having an option to do either/or in the downtime will be refreshing to this game as a whole. Not damaging.</div></div><hr />

Besides the zones that had their layout revamped in cataclysm the zone layouts are the exact same.

Regardless of what people may think the fact of the matter is that classic wow is a good investment option for Blizzard. Even if people unsub from the game due to whatever reason they have, classic wow will bring players back. So you buy a sub for however long period of time regardless if you play the current expansion or not is a still a win-win for Activision. And guess what, this makes their quarterly numbers look good as well on their earnings call. Blizzard goes by looking at players time investment in wow so if the classic server works out well, then it will not be a surprise if they release a separate server for BC and onwards.</div></div><hr />

The simple fact is that even if you hate the direction of retail then you should want Classic to be as successful as humanly possible. Blizzard no doubt has fallen victim to using dozens of reporting metrics to gauge their direction for the game rather than thinking from the perspective of gamers. If Classic is overwhelmingly successful then they will no doubt take influence and re-introduce some of the elements from Classic back into retail. <br />
<br />

<br />
The whole azerite system, amd the loss of rotational complexity was a giant fuckup. I don't think anybody's disagreeing with that. Still, what I'm reading here all sounds really positive and while I'll reserve judgement until we have specifics, it is completely mental to be whining about changes that you literally know nothing about. The implementation might be good, or it might not, but unless you're pessimistic to the point of mostly being an asshole about almost anything ever, this at least represents a step in the right direction.<br />
<br />
I'm sure that nobody is intentionally trying to make their game worse. That's not because I have any kind of pro-Blizzard bias, but because doing something like that would be completely idiotic on its face. <br />
<br />
Either way I'm not sure it matters because any sane person is just going to ignore a vocal minority of people who have been shouting about how the sky is falling since the dawn of time, but having no faith whatsoever in the possibility of positive changes ever happening has to be incredibly tiring.</div></div><hr />

Going forward, the team is going to have a much higher priority on getting end game gear progression into the player's hand in the early stages of the alpha and beta tests.<br />
<br />
Yeah, no shit sherlock. We were on the discords, talking and testing with TCers, and everybody was scratching their heads as to why it was almost launch and azerite wasn't on the beta/PTR. I might believe this statement if BFA weren't obviously rushed to meet some arbitrary shareholder deadline or w/e, and they had listened to beta feedback since, idk, at least WoD?<br />
<br />
<br />
The team has to find a middle ground between many different play styles.<br />
Flying is a good example. There are those who think flying makes the world feel smaller and some who want the convenience. The system evolved from getting it for gold, to not having it at all, and ultimately settled on a method that they feel is a nice middle ground.<br />
<br />
Kindly f off with this bullshart, Ion. It wasn't a good example and it wasn't a compromise. We've been grounded arbitrarily for months at this point. Keep Pathfinder part I, timegate flying behind three, MAYBE four months from launch, and I'll call it a compromise.<br />
<br />
And, btw, that has nothing to do with the portal debacle. It's ludicrous there'd even be a comparison drawn there.<br />

there was no actual customization in the legion artifacts, that was one of the failings plus you very quickly unlocked all the major traits, like 3 weeks ish, then you just got the infinite trait<br />

Tier sets were boring, yes. I don't know why you're bringing that up with me. The Legion legendaries weren't though, at least from my experience with them. They were frustrating to obtain at times, but once I had all of them I could use ones that fit certain encounters and they directly altered my rotation. Beyond being generic, azerite traits are also heinous to me in that they just flooded me with procs out of my control, far more than I'd ever had before.</div></div><hr />

Azerite traits piss me off because I had I admit an unusual piece of bad luck with a high item level one.<br />
<br />
It rolled that usual faction trait which is fair. Alliance trait on my Alliance character.<br />
<br />
But then it showed a BM and MM trait. And there was no Survival Trait on it. And SV is my main spec.<br />
<br />
I'd honestly prefer tier sets back in terms of looks though. Because most of the current armor sets look garbage imo.<br />
<br />
And yeah you barely have any control in the Azerite system as you said. You have to hope the armor you need drops or make do with an inferior piece.</div></div><hr />

WTF. If I wanted to play a different MMO, I would buy a new MMO and play it.<br />
Ion and his team have a seriously bad disease of Idle Hands (TM).<br />
This is why they always end up with terrible expansion, like BFA, that ultimately get followed up with a good expansion.<br />

You don't need to have a &quot;new experience&quot;. There's a reason most of the playable time is spent doing instanced stuff and not actual questing.</div></div><hr />

Meanwhile as a healer in Legion, you used Prydaz and Velen's for basically everything. One passive and the other a boring clicky that makes you do more healing once every 90ish seconds.<br />

Certain specs most certainly had viable if not better ones outside of those. Especially Resto Shaman. Praetorians Tidecallers were wicked strong for the most part. Not to mention Roots was also another amazing one.<br />

No, we've been hearing this for 3 expansions. Clearly the team is full of fucking idiots and never learns anything, or doesn't care.<br />
They have been learning since Vanilla and are learning as we speak. Learning is part of life, you'll keep doing it till you die.<br />

I disagree only in that in BC after you can fly you can reach areas of Outland previously inaccessible while leveling on the ground.

<br />
I had a helm that made Dragon's Breath part of the main rotation and gave it range<br />
A belt that made scorch an execute<br />
Another belt that made Blizzard a burst ability and worth using ST<br />
A ring that let me TW twice in one fight<br />
Hands that let me combust more often, so I had to think more about pooling fireblasts.<br />
Wrists that made Pyro worth hardcasting on proc<br />
A chest that made blink give a shield, so I wanted to use it more strategically<br />
<br />
Now Legion wasn't my favorite era of design or anything, but I certainly had more to think about than with azerite traits.<br />
<br />
<br />
I haven't played Lock since MoP, but I would guess &quot;Enemies affected by rain of fire take 10% extra damage from your fire spells,&quot; and &quot;While you have rift open, all damage increased by 10%&quot; means lining up cds with those windows. <br />
&quot;doom deal 5% more per demon you have&quot; would mean making sure you max your demons before your next doom. <br />
&quot;when you cc a target gain movement speed and haste&quot; would mean abusing add fights to get up time on the buff. <br />
&quot;call dreadstalkers refund 1 shard&quot; you can spend shards more efficiently, which may or may not give more to think about. <br />
&quot;each enemy affliction by your unstable affliction increases damage by 4%&quot; just sounds like something to teach bad players that maintaining dots on multitarget is important, but it could make you want to spend shards more aggressively rather than pooling for big UA dumps.<br />
<br />
It doesn't sound like locks had as interesting legos as mages, but I'd still say they require more thinking than &quot;you have a chance to shoot a waterball for 3000 damage.&quot;</div></div><hr />

Hate to say it but when they announced in MOP they were removing it I quit. Not one expansion I’ve read about since has made me rethink my decision.<br />

Blizzard will never learn that player happiness means more than their designers getting to show off “their” world. If you want to show off your world, make reasons to play in it. Not repeatedly taking away all players have earned from a decade or more of collecting and earning.</div></div><hr />

Except that it sounds so fake. To me, the design for azerite was so obviously bad that it's clear they weren't focused on how to make the game enjoyable... they were focused on getting us to play more and building a better hamsterwheel so they could hit revenue targets in the short term while continuing to burn everyone out over the long term.<br />
<br />
What the &quot;learned&quot; was that players have a limit for how much the devs can squeeze out before we start quitting en masse. The whole strategy of &quot;squeeze the player base&quot; has seemed crazy to me for a long time given that wow is such a cash cow... to me it seems that you try to keep the players happy and let the dividends roll in, and don't fuck with a historic success... but then again I'm not responsible for hitting revenue targets set by investors who will fire me if I don't reach them.<br />
<br />
I don't believe a word of what Ion says. He's telling us what he thinks we want to hear but doing whatever the hell he can to get us to pay as much money as possible.<br />

Everyone bitching about how Pathfinder takes so long.<br />
<br />
They should have NEVER added flying mounts. Period. You do not understand the DISSERVICE the flying mount does. <br />
<br />
This game went from Exploring a world, to Flying point a-b thru a skybox. IF you think thats fun game play, id question your IQ.<br />
<br />
Guess what the classic community is happy about..No fucking flying. WHY? because of the perceived notion of exploration.<br />
<br />
The last game i can think of that had real exploration and flying was AION, and that game was built from the GROUND up to be a flying game.<br />
<br />
remove flying mounts, and add more &quot;endgame&quot; non raid content to the existing azeroth. Simple. UTILIZE what you have at your disposal<br />
<br />
But... once they added it, they never should have removed it. Removing it permanently fractured the player base in a way that the game has never recovered from, and probably never will.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GreenJesus</div><div class="date">2019-04-04, 01:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That really depends. If you go back to artifact weapons, there was basically one added active ability trait, the rest were pretty much passives/procs. That's not to say it's bad, as some of those traits really did change your rotation or how you played or made certain spells more impactful/eaningful. I find that fun, and some Azerite traits did allow this. If Blizz is going to start adding a bunch of extra buttons to push, they run the risk of adding too many buttons to press just to have buttons to press... as well as the potential balancing nightmare that would ensue. Even if everyone had the same generic buttons to press, their effects and power would still vary greatly among classes depending upon their interactions.<br />
<br />
What I'd really hope for is either adding one active ability with a bunch of supporting passives/procs that either tie into said ability or baseline spec abilities (Legion artifact model), or to only be able to choose one active ability out of a few depending upon what you want. I'd be willing to let Blizz put more than 5 seconds of thought into this like I have and wow me (excuse the pun) with a new, innovative, and fun system.<br />
<br />
Slight aside, anyone else notice we're doing Legion in reverse here? Relic traits are basically was Azerite armor is, and this new HoA system appears like it'll be similar to the Legion artifact weapons.<br />
<br />
Yep. They chose the crucible (worst part of the artifact) upside down as their progression system. They just rearranged the crucible traits to Be 3 concentric circles (with 8.1 4) instead of a pyramid and called it a &quot;new feature&quot;. Lol. At least they finally admitted that Azerite armor wasn't tested and they just slapped it in last minute and rushed the expansion out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm also looking forward to how Nazjatar may work given what we've experienced on Broken shore/Argus especially since they called out wanting things to feel different.<br />
<br />
This has a flavor as though to let us know they have been paying attention to feedback like that, which probably led to better feeling for a lot of folks outside the salt mine present on this forum still shrieking about pathfinder.<br />
<br />
I'll just suggest a little more communication on things like, this latest snafu with the leveling potions. Two days leaving that up without word that it ought not be pursued was somewhat irresponsible and led to a lot of nonsense for all concerned. I'm glad that I dodged the whole thing by forgetting about the potion and not leveling toons in that window, but when the next weird thing like that comes up I hope that its quietly dealt with or acknowledged instead of hoping I avoid that part of the game by blind luck.<br />

The whole 'Blizzard are always ruining the game' thing really loses a lot of its bite when the same people spout it whenever there's literally any news whatsoever, even to the point of contradicting themselves by whining about one thing and then still whining when Blizzard does the exact opposite thing. <br />
<br />
The whole azerite system, amd the loss of rotational complexity was a giant fuckup. I don't think anybody's disagreeing with that. Still, what I'm reading here all sounds really positive and while I'll reserve judgement until we have specifics, it is completely mental to be whining about changes that you literally know nothing about. The implementation might be good, or it might not, but unless you're pessimistic to the point of mostly being an asshole about almost anything ever, this at least represents a step in the right direction.<br />
<br />
I'm sure that nobody is intentionally trying to make their game worse. That's not because I have any kind of pro-Blizzard bias, but because doing something like that would be completely idiotic on its face. <br />
<br />
Either way I'm not sure it matters because any sane person is just going to ignore a vocal minority of people who have been shouting about how the sky is falling since the dawn of time, but having no faith whatsoever in the possibility of positive changes ever happening has to be incredibly tiring.<br />

You're failing at life if you're not constantly learning. There are lots of mistakes but social media blasts are far worse than the actuality of the situation. More or less most complaints are just fueled nonsense from a trend the internet has these days.<br />

If serious = Blizzard know what works and doesn't, you have to be very asinine to think Blizzard are still &quot;learning&quot;. New companies sure, old ones like Blizzard no. They are a company made for shareholders and that is it, they couldn't give two shits about their customer base and will only lift a finger once it hurts their bottom line or has some bad PR attached to it. Ion is the biggest bullshiter out of the lot of them, that is why he has the job for, he is sly, very sly and I've seen a fair few people like him in my time. <br />

Blizzard deserve what they get, and it's about time people stop putting up with the constant lying.</div></div><hr />

If anything it just cemented even further that he does not care about any of these issues at all and thinks that removing things is totally fine and should have been done sooner.

<br />
You're just part of that internet angry ego mania that thinks they're insightful about the on goings of how companies work. Your lifetime of experience is too small to account for anything substantial especially regarding business and go ahead and insert some bullshit about how your 40 years of working blah blah blah is enough to account for making whatever nonsense you say are facts. If you paid any attention at all the company specifically the WoW team has been changing non stop for the last decade so what do you mean they aren't learning? Anytime you change your team at work you completely disrupt the product and if you don't know that then that's your problem.<br />
I'm not saying i don't like the current state of the game, but i learned to get my head out of my ass and realized there's so many damn people in this game that actually likes the direction of the game and the people who constantly squeal about hating the game are just the loudest. I personally want TBC/vanilla/wotlk type of game but will i get that? Maybe if vanilla servers are true vanilla servers. You just eventually realize that nothing is perfect in life and the way the internet goes on about handling &quot;fixing&quot; things just works in reverse and makes it worse.</div></div><hr />

<br />
He forgot the part were massive wave of players unsubbed. Which then forced the devs to add flying. But what he calls the &quot;middle ground&quot;/pathfinder is just retailiation towards the playerbase that wanted flying. By making players wait months after the expansion has dropped.

<br />
You wouldn't know a good interview if it hit you straight in the face. Let's see what Ion said that's so great:<br />
<br />
<br />
8.2 is a &quot;very large content patch.&quot; They say this about every patch, just so people come back to the game at least to check it out.<br />
<br />
8.2 will take the best features of past endgame content, but is also trying a lot of new things. Meaningless PR speech.<br />
<br />
The team doesn't just want Nazjatar to feel like a familiar formula applied to a new set of terrain, but an actual meaningful different game experience from the past few months. Meaningless PR speech - it tells you NOTHING about what the content is and how it looks like.<br />
<br />
Having to re-earn your traits as you get better gear is not fun and something they want to completely move away from. Saying what people have been saying from BfA day 1. Damage control with no concrete info - what are they changing? when? what about the mechanics that are implemented right now? will they be removed? modified? Nothing.<br />
<br />
8.2 will continue to have new Azerite traits unique to Azshara's raid or to Mechagon that compliment the existing pool of traits. Nothing new, every raid tier added new Azerite traits.<br />
<br />
Traits will be fully unlocked and players can choose their talents that best fits their play style.First part is actual info, second is stating the obvious.<br />
<br />
The Heart of Azeroth will continue to use Azerite Power for a progression path on the Heart itself that consists of both passive and active traits. How to use many words to say nothing.<br />
<br />
Active abilities will be actual new spells that are placed on the hotbar and have a meaningful change to your combat rotation immediately.<br />
You could consolidate two previous points into: Heart of Azeroth will now unlock Active skills players will have to use from their hotbar. But I guess he's being paid per word spoken.<br />
<br />
Addressing the core system of Azerite Armor was something Tides of Vengeance couldn't do, and so the team added the 5th ring and more customization while they worked on the new system for the past couple months. Postponing fixing major problems the game has AGAIN. Making excuses. Great interview so far.<br />
<br />
The team learned a lot about the importance of player agency. The &quot;team&quot; has some mental problems, because they have learning problems. They keep &quot;learning&quot; basic concepts of a MMORPG every interview, yet somehow they make the same mistakes over and over again.<br />
<br />
The Azerite System was designed to respond to the failings of Legion Artifacts in which the customization was very frontloaded. Doesn't matter what it was &quot;supposed to do&quot; if it failed spectacularly. Excuses. <br />
<br />
They feel that having all traits unlocked on Legion weapons, not having any big choices, and being the same as every other person of your class was a missed opportunity to give players more choice. Yet people had more fun with it than your forced &quot;you have a choice with Azerite traits, but not really&quot; approach. You've been taking away choice from players for several years now, so stop pretending like it's a priority for you.<br />
<br />
One of their biggest mistakes in the BfA beta was waiting too long to get the Azerite Armor and traits fully stood up in the beta.Your biggest mistake was ignoring the massive feedback that Azerite armor and traits are garbage from the beta testers.<br />
<br />
Going forward, the team is going to have a much higher priority on getting end game gear progression into the player's hand in the early stages of the alpha and beta tests.Another bunch of promises of the &quot;we'll do better next time&quot;. Nobody believes that anymore, Ion.<br />
<br />
I could go on, but it's a waste of yours and my time. Ion uses PR speech, empty sentences and what &quot;the team wants and feels&quot; to shut people up while they keep ruining the game. <br />
Defend him if you want. BfA was finally the expansion that killed WoW for me. The amount of WoW refugees in FFXIV speaks for itself.<br />
I recommend watching https://youtu.be/WVj389dsd6o?t=615 to realize when you're being manipulated by PR speech. Just because &quot;the team&quot; is working on something, doesn't like something, &quot;feels&quot; something about a mechanic doesn't mean they will change or fix it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
yeah, you are right here, but it's true this is a very large content patch tho, IF, what they have said so far is not a lie:<br />
<br />
-heroic warfronts for premade groups (10)<br />
-the raid<br />
-one zone a little bigger than timeless<br />
-one bigger zone<br />
-one mega dungeon<br />
-fixes to the azerite<br />
<br />
It looks like a really good patch, I understand people that won't believe anything until seen tho, but what I don't understand is bashing because bashing, or just the negative echo chamber that Eleccybub is making just answering negative posts with another negative comment for example.<br />

<br />
I can't deny anything you say, because I'm not that smart to read when it's just PR and not. What I actually meant with a good interview is that they do read it seems and are aware we are anxious for that 8.2 PTR, that's why they made this interview, it eased me and gave me some information about some stuff I was wondering.<br />
<br />
I won't defend everything they say or do, they have done bad shit, but also good stuff, more bad than good with how BFA started, but it has improved and I actually believe that not everything he says is just PR or someone with strings handing him a paper with the answers.<br />
<br />
You must agree with me, that when we as humans are tired or hate someone/something they will see everything they do as something bad or at least it will be hard for them to acknowledge something good from it/him/her.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying this is happening with you, because I don't know you, but I'm pretty sure it's happening with a lot of people on the forums, and that is damaging the community, not just blizzard.<br />

How can he tell something and still manage to not explain it properly? What exactly are 8.2. Azerite armor changes? Will we be able to choose EVERY possible trait in EVERY piece of AA or certain AA will still contain predetermined set of traits but unlocked from the very start (basically HoA level 1)? If its the first option then yes, its basically second talent panel, and thats awesome. <br />
If its second option then its pointless for everyone who played BFA for more than a week (i got HoA level 40 in a mere 4 days) and its not viable change or even deserving of mention, especially since we still need to level our HoA in 8.2. <br />
So what is it?<br />
<br />
This is not the complete interview, he said before that, that he wouldn't say much because they want us to see when they dump it all in the PTR, he is just outlining here so we at least get a general Idea before we get our hands on it.</div></div><hr />

You reap what you sow. Activision-Blizzard sold out the goodwill of their playerbase over the years.<br />
What really matters is the end product. I don't care that the shit I'm being handed smells quite nice and doesn't taste as bad as it used to, when at the end of the day it came out of Ion's ASS.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Too bad they didnt follow the same style as Japan. If an online game/expac is a dumpster fire, it's scrapped..reworked and re-released in a much better state. That's what happened with FF online.

<br />
The whole azerite system, amd the loss of rotational complexity was a giant fuckup. I don't think anybody's disagreeing with that. Still, what I'm reading here all sounds really positive and while I'll reserve judgement until we have specifics, it is completely mental to be whining about changes that you literally know nothing about. The implementation might be good, or it might not, but unless you're pessimistic to the point of mostly being an asshole about almost anything ever, this at least represents a step in the right direction.<br />
<br />
I'm sure that nobody is intentionally trying to make their game worse. That's not because I have any kind of pro-Blizzard bias, but because doing something like that would be completely idiotic on its face. <br />
<br />
Either way I'm not sure it matters because any sane person is just going to ignore a vocal minority of people who have been shouting about how the sky is falling since the dawn of time, but having no faith whatsoever in the possibility of positive changes ever happening has to be incredibly tiring.<br />
<br />

Its so fucking boring! I haven't touched any of the other Content. I didn't even log into my 120 Chars after I unlocked the Fatties. <br />
<br />
And don't see why they fucking bother with Endgame Content, when they Core-Mechanics are so fucking bad. They could add 2345 more Warfronts, Islands, Raids and fucking Quest-Zones - I WOULD NOT PLAY IT!<br />

All I'm waiting for now is Classic, that at least has some good Gameplay and Social-Mechanics that don't rely on new Content ever 2 Weeks.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">FelPlague</div><div class="date">2019-04-04, 09:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I had a helm that made Dragon's Breath part of the main rotation and gave it range<br />
A belt that made scorch an execute<br />
Another belt that made Blizzard a burst ability and worth using ST<br />
A ring that let me TW twice in one fight<br />
Hands that let me combust more often, so I had to think more about pooling fireblasts.<br />
Wrists that made Pyro worth hardcasting on proc<br />
A chest that made blink give a shield, so I wanted to use it more strategically<br />
<br />
Now Legion wasn't my favorite era of design or anything, but I certainly had more to think about than with azerite traits.<br />
<br />
<br />
I haven't played Lock since MoP, but I would guess &quot;Enemies affected by rain of fire take 10% extra damage from your fire spells,&quot; and &quot;While you have rift open, all damage increased by 10%&quot; means lining up cds with those windows. <br />
&quot;doom deal 5% more per demon you have&quot; would mean making sure you max your demons before your next doom. <br />
&quot;when you cc a target gain movement speed and haste&quot; would mean abusing add fights to get up time on the buff. <br />
&quot;call dreadstalkers refund 1 shard&quot; you can spend shards more efficiently, which may or may not give more to think about. <br />
&quot;each enemy affliction by your unstable affliction increases damage by 4%&quot; just sounds like something to teach bad players that maintaining dots on multitarget is important, but it could make you want to spend shards more aggressively rather than pooling for big UA dumps.<br />
<br />
It doesn't sound like locks had as interesting legos as mages, but I'd still say they require more thinking than &quot;you have a chance to shoot a waterball for 3000 damage.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
going into the demo stuff<br />
<br />
rift was very often you had 3 charges and its cooldown was short, and it was one of your strongest hitting spells so yeah you lined stuff up<br />
<br />
doom hit every 15 ish seconds, we are not talking the 1 minute long doom we used to have, it was a dot you just kept up on your target<br />
but wait, isnt that just &quot;extra stats&quot; almost like how current azerite traits (will go into that at the end)<br />
lol that does not change anythin,g its literally just you cast 1 less shadowbolt.<br />
<br />
<br />
lets talk about some of the azerite traits i know that change your rotation.<br />
<br />
1. baleful invocation- when you summon tyrant, it gives you 5 soul shards instead of normally giving you none... yeah<br />
2. Explosive potential, means you want to be using implosion to keep this massive haste buff up<br />
3. demonic meteor, chance to refund soul shards (if you are gunna include call dreadstallkers refund 1 i will include this)<br />
4. incinerate has chance to generate a full soul shard (again idf you are gunna include dreadstalkers i will include this)<br />
5. chaos has chance to make your next incinerate instant, meaning you cant just chaos bolt chain, you will break that up with incinerates<br />
6. bursting flare makes you gain a stacking master buff as long as you use conflag on a target with imolate, meaning you will keep your buff up constantly.<br />
7.inevitable corruption gives you a stacking buff when you deal damage with agony, that turns drain life from a healing spell, into a massive single target burst.<br />
8. suddeny onset gives you 4 stacks with agony to start, this is a huge allowance for intial dps and speeds up your rate to 10 stacks.<br />
9. cascading calamity gives you a buff if you cast unstable affliction while you already have UA on the dude, this means you want to overlap them.<br />
10. dreadful calling makes UA reduce the cooldown of darkglare, meaning you get darkglarte more often and have to watch those burst phases more often.<br />
11. supreme commander makes your demonic tyrant once it run out give intellgience<br />
meaning that for 15 seconds after casting it buffs your demons, then ANOTHER 15 seconds after that, it buffs your intelligence. meaning the 15 second dps duration becomes a 30 second dps duration.<br />
12.shadows bite makes your demon bolts do extra damage for abit after using dreadstalker, making you pool your demon bolts for when you dreadstalker.</div></div><hr />

8.2 would have to be the best patch in wow history by a factor of 3-5 to get me to come back at this point. <br />
<br />
I’m all in for classic, but don’t really like the ARPG style of today’s wow. I prefer a slower paced mmo rpg to a faster paced seasonal arpg that wow has become. Wow today has more in common with diablo 3 than Everquest. Nuff said</div></div><hr />

that was amongst the most gutless, spineless and cowardly response i've ever seen a head of a game make. They are afraid of doing fun things because they've been burnt before and are worried about what could happen 3-5 years down the line? At this rate, he'll be lucky if the game is still up and running 3-5 years from now. He has no idea what he's talking about.<br />
<br />
If i ran the team, i'd legit make them play nothing but old MUD's, EQ, and games that pre-dated WoW in order to recapture what was special about WoW. it isn't meant to be an ARPG, or competitive to a fault... it's meant to be an open world RPG with friends. period.<br />
<br />
They've gone so far off the reservation of what WoW is supposed to be that the current game resembles Diablo 3 more than EQ1 or Vanilla WoW and that's a problem.<br />
<br />
Hard to think of many other games that swapped entire genres this late into it's life cycle.</div></div><hr />

That's because the older team cut their teeth playing MUDs, Everquest, and older titles that really emphasized world, social elements, uniqueness, and a world full of real danger.<br />
<br />
The current team looks like they cut their teeth playing WoW and think WoW was the OG of MMORPG's, and they draw inspiration from games like Diablo 3 for loot systems and flood us in loot like we're playing Borderlands, and not like we're playing a monthly MMORPG.<br />
<br />
WoW's lost it's MMORPG touch, and replaced it with ARPG. Simple as that.</div></div><hr />

Oh Ions basically said something like this before in an interview back in January where he blames the playerbase for the faults of the games.<br />
<br />
ActiBlizz are basically Trion now in terms of that. Trion used to blame their playerbase a lot for when Rift content came out buggy.<br />
<br />
The fact that you can have the gall to sit there and blame your own players for your shortcomings with the game is absolutely sad. <br />
<br />
Meanwhile when FF14 1.0 was that bad Square issued an official apology and remade the entire game to be better and ran by a guy who had MMO experience as a player. Not to mention Yoshi-P has openly admitted that FF14 isn't perfect and apologises any time for something the players may not like but they have to do. That's a good game director.</div></div><hr />

For those that don't like flying, here's a fun fact. It's been in the game longer than most players. I find it amusing that Blizz continues to find ways to take a perfectly good feature and restrict it behind arbitrary achievements and/or meaningless rep grinds. I know that I've seen some hints that flying would be available in the 8.2 content beyond Kul Tiras and Zandalar, but I highly doubt that. If Isle of Thunder and Argus are the norms for late xpac updates, they are going to keep us grounded indefinitely. <br />
<br />
Content wise, I would love to see something better than islands and warfronts. When those were announced I was already &quot;meh&quot; about them. Here's hoping that 9.0 is something spectacular, but I am not going to come back for 8.2.</div></div><hr />

The team wanted to consolidate portals into something that was more intuitive and made more sense within the world. They didn't want players having to place their Hearthstone in old expansion content because it was the most accessible area.<br />

<br />
I think the current playerbase enjoy a more consolidated content focused on current content; those that enjoy more bigger open worlds are probably no longer playing for a long time.<br />
<br />
I think WoW has always been very focused on current patch since TBC when badge catch-up gear was introduced, it's just that the gap between patches/expansions get larger, so it's not really something unique to any single expansion other than maybe vanilla. BFA up until that point just further widened that gap due to removal of tier bonuses and interesting trinkets</div></div><hr />

This only applies to new zones obviously since flying works fine in the old world already, and it is pretty simple you get a parachute just like any other zone that used to dismount you in the air. The tech is literally already in the game to do it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
FF14 doesn't have seamless zones either as most Modern MMOs don't. So getting to the edge of a zone isn't an issue. Plus it has wall barriers in place just like WoW does vertically but for more around the zone limits.<br />
<br />
But not the point that was being made anyway. The fact is FF14 and how you unlock flying is the perfect way to do it. You shouldn't have to wait a year only to be bombarded with another timegate in that year in the form of an achievement.</div></div><hr />

<br />
why? is been 2 expansion already with the same system, and they didnt announce any change to it, why even star playing BFA if you didnt like how Fly is implemnt. <br />
<br />
For me Pathfinder is irrelevant, since isnt a grind, since you complet the rep w/o even plaing, and make the world more engaging at least for pvp. Yeah the ppl that claim that they saw more ppl with flying that w/o it they lie.<br />
<br />
Since WotLK flying become a way to avoid ppl, and fly into the NPC you need to kill and leave.<br />
A good example is the Invasion points on BFA right now with Flying ppl will be avoing pvp on those, and you will never see those big battle that happen during each invasion.<br />
<br />
Fly on WOW allow player to play less, and is really not fun. So i dont get why everyone QQ that much about flying, since BC zone are small, and more compat so moving dont take that long. <br />
The biggest issue with BC was the zone where so big to make flying relevant, making the zone feel empty and ugly</div></div><hr />
