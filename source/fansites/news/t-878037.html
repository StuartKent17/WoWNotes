Good luck doing Argaloth with only shamy heals now.<br />

I think that they intended to only add the &quot;This effect cannot occur more that once every 6secs&quot; but somehow fucked up the cooldown (Or the dataminig did)</div></div><hr />

The dispel works on GCD, just the heal has a 6 second cooldown. Don't post QQ when you aren't sure about the facts.<br />

Because its not the dispell that gets a 6 second nerf but the additional healing effect the target recieves after a dispell gets a 6 cooldown.<br />

Reading comprehension. The heal that procs off of your dispel has a cooldown. Not the dispel itself. Huge angryface post over nothing, lol. Anyways, finally a little more survivability when my bear is tanking multiple mobs, and increased threat gen to boot! Not so much of a healing sponge anymore &lt;3</div></div><hr />

Maybe make it apply only in arenas/rbgs, but not pve content. There are plenty of things I dispel in pve. I can't fathom what roadblocks this 6sec cooldown is going to give me. Weak. Time to level my priest or my mage, considering the op class is becoming more op instead of being balanced.<br />

You don't even know what you are talking about. The healing component attached to shaman cleansing shouldn't be your main method of healing your allies anyway. Don't you read?

Like you troll and other ppl here need a buff on brains! :P Lets ask God..<br />

Anyway they said that arcane need better aoe. They are trying to fix that about 3/4 weeks ago with some changes. If they are still making changes is because last ones did not do what they want. <br />
Did anyone saw any arcane mage top dps on aoe fight? Yeah they are op!<br />
<br />
Anyway Fire did not get any buff, only a fix to ignite that = less 200dps = nerf, only arcane is getting some love because without bis gear, DI and innervates everybody know is one of the worst spec (little better then frost) for pve especially for boss where you need to aoe.</div></div><hr />

1. No, no you really don't, lol.<br />
<br />
2. Oh no! I wonder what it must be like in this magical world you live in, where pvp is 1v1 and you don't have teammates to peel off of you, train opponents with interrupts, and apply pressure? Sounds crappy to me.<br />
<br />
3. When you state that shamans are going back (going back? lol) to being the worst pvp healers because a proc from an ability that you really shouldn't be spamming the entire game, which is prolly why your stuck at ~1700 rating and frustrated because now you have to play your class the way it was intended to be played, instead of backpedaling in circles and spamming dispels as hard as you can; it's much easier to just say you don't know what you're talking about and mistook the healing proc for the actual dispel, like the other thinking challenged jackwagons in the first few pages did. At least that's my take on it.</div></div><hr />

Note: I don't play a resto shaman. I do enjoy killing them though and it seems it's gonna be even easier next patch.<br />
<br />
<br />
I just feel bad for all the resto shamans out there, I find it &quot;funny&quot; how shamans of any spec aren't ever allowed to be best at anything. Throughout the history of wow, every time a shaman spec has become best at something (mostly through a patch change) they have very swiftly been hit hard by the nerfhammer to get them down to the low-middle end of the pack, while some classes have been left &quot;op&quot; or &quot;best&quot; for an entire expansion or more. Talk about double standards.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, they're not huge or anything, but I'm wondering why they're there at all. DKs aren't OP in pve, and they aren't any more OP in pvp than other class/specs.<br />

<br />
Fire mages are high on the charts #3 I think. Arcane mages (who are getting these buffs) are second to last. <br />
<br />
DKs are pretty average right now, but they are getting other huge buffs (which aren´t live yet). Frost in particular is doing decent now, is getting a huge buffs involving blood runes, and now is getting a nerf (to the base damage) of one spell. Overall, I think all DKs will be getting overall buffed when 4.1 launches, you are just seeing one nerf here without the other buffs.<br />
<br />
You need to look at the entirety of the patch notes, not just what gets put there today. In other words, don´t look at the DPS charts from live, then look at the very last patch notes from the PTR and say a weak spec is getting nerfed... you are missing the other 10 sets of PTR patch notes.</div></div><hr />

What a stupid, stupid, stupid change. Where is the druid/priest/paladin dispel nerf? I guess I'm used to shaman being abused by patches but this is just fucking ridiculous. Maybe make it apply only in arenas/rbgs, but not pve content. There are plenty of things I dispel in pve. I can't fathom what roadblocks this 6sec cooldown is going to give me. Weak. Time to level my priest or my mage, considering the op class is becoming more op instead of being balanced.<br />
<br />
I don't even play a shaman I immediately realized that the dispell itself isn't getting a cooldown, only the healing part of dispell.<br />

DKs are pretty average right now, but they are getting other huge buffs (which aren´t live yet). Frost in particular is doing decent now, is getting a huge buffs involving blood runes, and now is getting a nerf (to the base damage) of one spell. Overall, I think all DKs will be getting overall buffed when 4.1 launches, you are just seeing one nerf here without the other buffs.<br />
<br />
You need to look at the entirety of the patch notes, not just what gets put there today. In other words, don´t look at the DPS charts from live, then look at the very last patch notes from the PTR and say a weak spec is getting nerfed... you are missing the other 10 sets of PTR patch notes.<br />

<br />
Not really. Any lock not still stuck grinding for 2200 (read: decent) will effectively have my entire team dotted up. Dispelling through UA isn't a death sentence, but it's a calculated risk. Sitting through a 4 second silence after removing 1 curse and 1 magic debuff gives him a chance to put up a new two and a half spells, assuming they put zero other CC on the shaman at all. Ever tried healing against boomkin lock? Good luck now.<br />
Not arguing that cleansing waters wasn't insanely powerful. A 6k heal every 1.5 seconds is pretty decent. But the spell solely responsible for high shaman representation is Wind Shear. This nerf was just to soothe bad lock's tears.</div></div><hr />

Frost Strike was not nerfed back. The initial buff increased Frost Strike weapon dmg by 20%. This nerf to base dmg is very small in comparison. Also, if you think Death Strike is useless in pvp for Frost DK's, you've never used it or your not using Glyph of Dark Succor. People don't use Death Strike for the dmg. I'm not happy about the nerfs, but Frost is still getting an overall buff.</div></div><hr />

A holy priest friend of mine with similar gear as my restoration shaman with a glyphed Dispel Magic will heal on average for 5k a dispel. My resto shaman was healing for about 6k. This data was mined out of our Argaloth fights and using World of Logs. <br />
<br />
So now in a period of 6 seconds my priest friend and I will be able to cast our respective dispel three times each. The priest will heal 15k health in that time period through Dispel Magic alone. However, the shaman will only heal for 6k health. On top of this, the priest's Dispel Magic will remove 2 magic debuffs to the one that the Shaman will remove.<br />
<br />
Now, the cost of the priest's Dispel Magic is slightly more expensive than Cleanse Spirit is, 16% base mana to 14% base mana, but hardly enough to justify the priest's dispel being better than the shaman's. I really hope they lower the cooldown on Cleansing Waters or allow Improved Clense Spirit to remove 2 harmful effects much like the priest's Dispel Magic does.

So do they absorb 10,500 over the 7 second period a bit like Blood Shield and PW:S or do they reduce each hit on them over that 7 second period by 10,500 regardless?<br />
<br />
BTW I used these numbers purely as an example<br />
<br />
It'll be like the blood shield, except consecutive SD procs probably won't stack (though an SD proc is probably bigger than a single DS shield, which will stack).<br />
<br />
The significance of this change is that currently, if you have 15k SD shield and an unfortunately aggro'd critter hits you for 1hp, the SD shield will be removed, having absorbed said 1hp damage; this makes bear AoE trash damage taken very high. Instead, the bear will have a shield which will absorb up to the SD amount for the next 10 seconds, hopefully with another SD shield proc'ing shortly for more absorbs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
SD as noted above, SD will have a completely different mechanic, and like other tank masteries, will most likely NOT block spell damage. Considering that bears already take less spell damage than any other class (between 12% reduction of all damage from PotP and the 6% magic damage reduction from Perseverance) (and yes I realize currently warriors take less trash magic damage, but end-game is more concerned about boss damage which is typically not reflectable, and AoE is definitely not reflectable), giving them an absorb that works on magic too would be more than even the ardent bear-lovers like me would ask for, or want - we want to be asked to tank because we are good players, not just because we're playing &quot;the right class&quot;.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sparklelord</div><div class="date">2011-03-30, 09:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So I crunched some numbers and found this really interesting regarding the Shaman change. A holy priest friend of mine with similar gear as my restoration shaman with a glyphed Dispel Magic will heal on average for 5k a dispel. My resto shaman was healing for about 6k. This data was mined out of our Argaloth fights and using World of Logs. <br />
<br />
So now in a period of 6 seconds my priest friend and I will be able to cast our respective dispel three times each. The priest will heal 15k health in that time period through Dispel Magic alone. However, the shaman will only heal for 6k health. On top of this, the priest's Dispel Magic will remove 2 magic debuffs to the one that the Shaman will remove.<br />
<br />
Now, the cost of the priest's Dispel Magic is slightly more expensive than Cleanse Spirit is, 16% base mana to 14% base mana, but hardly enough to justify the priest's dispel being better than the shaman's. I really hope they lower the cooldown on Cleansing Waters or allow Improved Clense Spirit to remove 2 harmful effects much like the priest's Dispel Magic does. I guess the third option would be to lower the cost of the spell as well.<br />
<br />
A) Are you accounting for the mana reducing aspect of Cleansing Waters?<br />
B) Your dispell removes a Magic and a Curse where as a priest's removes two magic (which is useless on Argaloth) and would have to use another GCD to cast Cure Disease.<br />
C) They should change the glyph so it only heals if it removes a magic effect. Only reason it heals for more is because it's percentage based which means, in your logs depending on how you sorted it, it will heal for a lot more on tanks than anything.<br />
D) Looking at the math, the average player in PvP will have 120k hp and roughly the same in PvE which would cause the priest's dispel to heal for 3600 (3% of 120k). If it's effect by healing talents and such it could heal for more.<br />
E) Shaman's cleanse cost is going to be roughly 1312 with talents while a priest's dispel magic is going to be roughly 3200. There's your reduced cost of the spell.</div></div><hr />

Fucking seriously? Savage defense change. Umm OP? I wonder if it scales with Vengeance.<br />
the 35% of AP absorb mechanic is exactly how it works on live now, the only thing changing is now its a 10 second physical shield as opposed to working on the next attack only, its not gonna be OP and buff single target bear survivability, its supposed to buff AOE survivability</div></div><hr />

This new change to the cast time is purely a buff. Maybe it's an attempt to increase mobility. (As lower cast times on spells makes them easier to tuck in between movements.)</div></div><hr />

There is a huge difference between being fine in PvP and being able to completely ignore a class's dmg because of an OP dispel. <br />
<br />
It makes me extremely happy to know that at least I won't have to worry about reapplying my dots every .2 seconds because shamans could give 2 shits about whether they are going to dispel UA or not. However, it still does not fix warlocks subpar dmg output. Most healers will still ignore the short silence and barely noticeable dmg when dispelling UA. Probably not holy paladins though, they'll probs already be dead, behind a pillar somewhere.</div></div><hr />

Priest can still do it, yes? A bit more mana maybe, but what are their pools looking like atm (compared to heavily shutting out an opposing player)? And, incidentally, it's not like 'lock are the only class against which shamans might want a high dispel output. They're just the ones whose damage output is hit hard by it... now, given that shaman healing output was balanced around cleansing waters existing, you know, for all those other non-lock fights, what should we do? Fix locks mechanics so they're not shut out so much by a team with a shaman... or nerf shamans against every team that happens to include any class with a magic debuff, to the point where, once again, why bother bringing them?<br />

Hmm, I MAY be wrong here but I do still remember my writing that most healers will still dispel UA, regardless [even shamans!] because of our redic low dmg output. So, you are saying that the only thing in arenas shamans rely on is their dispel? There are no other tools shamans bring to the fight other than a dispel? Then its not just the dispel mechanic broken its the entire spec. However, I think this change will makes shamans think rather than mindlessly pressing their dispel button. There maybe other spells you are just not use to casting, because you do not have to.<br />
<br />
You can still spam cleanse. You can still heal. Your dispel is not on a CD. I honestly do not see the problem except that shamans may not be AS redic OP vs warlocks and any other class that relies on their magic staying on the target.</div></div><hr />

Yes, the cheap heal on dispel with a valuable part of what shamans brought to the party... and the rest of their output was balanced around it... now? Locks will STILL be shut down almost as hard as before, just only by priests instead of shamans &amp; priests, but why bring a shaman the rest of the time (when the cost of a priests dispel/heal vs non locks provided some differentiation between the two) now instead of a priest? Wind shear might be struggling under the weight of that expectation... and locks still aren't fixed anyway. Nice.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Dear Lord! Maybe the aoe buff was not enouth? They allways prefer underbuff that overbuff because they know ppl react bad to nerfs even when they are nerf after a buff on PTR!<br />

datamine is datamine and not official or confirmed blue posts so stop crying or i really really wish boub would stop posting datamined stuff thats most the time wrong<br />
<br />
The problem is that datamine can't see if is only tooltip change or real change but if ppl read all blue patch notes they should now that half of this bob changes are only tooltips because they are allready on live or on ptr.</div></div><hr />

First, who the fuck cares about base additional damage? And second, these are mostly tooltip fixes.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Valacia</div><div class="date">2011-03-31, 01:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Fucking seriously? Savage defense change. Umm OP? I wonder if it scales with Vengeance.<br />
<br />
I'm going to be nice here because I assume you don't understand where bears are on live presently...<br />
<br />
Savage Defense has always procced a shield that is based on Attack power, however it has been a pseudo shield/absorb that was used on the next hit, whether that hit was for 5 times your total HP or for 1 HP, your shield was gone. What this meant is that bears are weaker against multiple mobs than block tanks and subsequently take much more damage in that type of situation (maloriak adds, for example)<br />
<br />
The only change to SD at this point is that the shield is no longer used up on the next hit, but is an actual absorb that lasts for 10 seconds or 35% of your attack power (and yes, it is totally affected by vengeance) whichever happens first. Just to point it out, block tanks will still block more damage than what a bear can absorb on really hard hitting bosses, and for single target nothing is changing. This really just means that as a bear I don't feel like I'm potentially gimping my raid if I'm tanking multiple adds (combine this with the awesome aoe buff we're getting and we might be able to hold aoe against a damn paladin...)</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Impulse</div><div class="date">2011-03-31, 02:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A) Are you accounting for the mana reducing aspect of Cleansing Waters?<br />
B) Your dispell removes a Magic and a Curse where as a priest's removes two magic (which is useless on Argaloth) and would have to use another GCD to cast Cure Disease.<br />
C) They should change the glyph so it only heals if it removes a magic effect. Only reason it heals for more is because it's percentage based which means, in your logs depending on how you sorted it, it will heal for a lot more on tanks than anything.<br />
D) Looking at the math, the average player in PvP will have 120k hp and roughly the same in PvE which would cause the priest's dispel to heal for 3600 (3% of 120k). If it's effect by healing talents and such it could heal for more.<br />
E) Shaman's cleanse cost is going to be roughly 1312 with talents while a priest's dispel magic is going to be roughly 3200. There's your reduced cost of the spell.<br />
<br />
A) No I was not, and I was also not taking into account Mental Agility. Taking those into account the dispel cost for a Shaman fully talented is ~7% base mana. Using the listed base mana of 23430 for a shaman, this means the spell will cost about 1.7k. For priests it is ~14%. Using the a priest base mana of 20590, Dispel Magic should cost ~3k mana.<br />
<br />
B) Yes, and in PVP it is much more likely to have several magic affects on a player. Hence removing two magic debuffs is very powerful. Noting that Argoloth only puts one magic debuff on a player is pointless. The PVE fights that put more than one debuff on a player without that person making several mistakes is rare.<br />
<br />
C) I would agree to this change and say no more if it happened. I would still urge for a similar cool-down on the heal though.<br />
<br />
D) Glyph of Dispel Magic is affected by healing talents. I am not sure if it is also affected by gear or not. Cleansing Waters is affected by both for sure. I assure you the numbers I gave earlier regarding the amount healed is largely correct for most fights. <br />
<br />
E) I concede that Cleanse does cost less. See response A. I think you over-inflated the priest's cost and under-inflated the shaman's cost to a degree though.<br />
<br />
The truth is the priest's Dispel Magic healing will surpass the healing from a shaman's Cleansing Waters by nearly doubling it after this patch is put in place. The shaman's Cleanse may only cost 2/3 the amount the priest's Dispel Magic costs, but it also takes the Shaman 2 talent points to get to that point. If you think that there are not other places those points could be spent elsewhere with this change, you are mistaken.<br />
<br />
My original point is and still remains, that if a shaman locking down a warlock or some other classes is a problem through its dispel mechanics, then priests should change as well as they can do the same thing minus decursing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
On the shaman dispell nerf, it's a needed change that will lead to a more enjoyable game for everyone.</div></div><hr />
