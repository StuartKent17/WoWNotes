We’re working on the following adjustments to raid encounters. These changes are not live yet, but will go live later this evening or tomorrow.<br />
<br />
Dungeons and Raids<br />
<br />
Battle of Dazar’alor<br />
<br />
Grong, the Jungle Lord<br />
<br />
Death Empowerment (Alliance) and Apetagonize (Horde) cast time increased to 5 seconds on Mythic difficulty (was 4 seconds).<br />
Death Specters (Alliance) and Apetagonizers (Horde) health reduced by 20% on Mythic difficulty.<br />
<br />
High Tinker Mekkatorque<br />
<br />
Gigavolt Charge’s radiation zone duration reduced to 2 minutes on Mythic difficulty (was 3 minutes).<br />
Tampering duration increased to 30 seconds on Mythic difficulty (was 25 seconds).<br />
<br />
Lady Jaina Proudmoore<br />
<br />
Jaina now kills all players instantly if the entire raid is frozen solid during an intermission phase.<br />
<br />
Developers’ note: Previously, if an entire raid was frozen solid, all players would have to wait until they each died before they could restart the encounter. This change will help raids quickly reset and start the fight again.</div></div><hr />

Because that would make too much sense. Remember that Blizzard is a small Indie company.</div></div><hr />

On my realm I met around 100 people during the weekend. They should just mass merge 10-20 realms together...</div></div><hr />

That would also make too much sense. You can't apply logic to Blizzard.</div></div><hr />

They should have done much more 3 expansions ago. Unfortunately for a long time they were financially rewarded by making people pay to move. In the short run it worked well for them. In the long run it is one of the many reasons people quit or play less. I truly feel bad for the people that stick it out on the many ghost town servers, even more so if they have never played anywhere else and don't realize how much better the game can be.</div></div><hr />

Did Ion never see tanks stay frozen for 2+ minutes during the intermission? It's almost hilarious to see their hitpoints slowly tick down to zero, before some random proc heals them and the whole thing starts over. The hilarity stops when you remember that it's actually a huge waste of time.</div></div><hr />

He probably did and that's why it changed, his guild started on Jaina like two weeks ago (those other nerfs came just after they started which I'm sure was completely unrelated).</div></div><hr />

i agree. WoW in its current forms no longer needs multiple servers just mega servers for regions, maybe one additional for Roleplaying server. they have phasing and sharding tech that would more than handle the load. it would make everything feel better in the world</div></div><hr />

if they were to even announce such a thing that's like committing corporate suicide, they would lose so much money from investors pulling out that the game would literally die as a result, they lost a lot when they announced the 'connected realms' feature but nothing compared to what they would lose if they straight up said 'we need to merge realms because we no longer have the players to sustain the current model' in public.</div></div><hr />

<br />
thats not at all what i just said.....i said that WoW in its current form with their server tech, multiple servers are uneeded. you'd only need 2 per region, Mega and RP Server and thats it....i wasnt saying that its because they have low subs or population on realms. its just because with phasing and connected servers and sharding multiple servers and uneeded</div></div><hr />

<br />
i understood exactly what you meant, i'm saying that if they did that then this is what the result would be regardless of whether it's good for the game or not.</div></div><hr />
