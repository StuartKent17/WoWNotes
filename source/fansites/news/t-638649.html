Spiritual Attunement is one of the best ways that ret paladins are actually to keep doing damage.<br />
No mana = no damage.<br />
And on top of that, you create a new glyph name &quot;Glyph of SEAL OF BLOOD&quot;, which now really only affects all them SoB using Prot pallies out there (COUGH NO ONE COUGH). <br />
So really you have done two things very well here.<br />
1. You have thoroughly smashed every ret pallies testicles out there.<br />
2. You have greated an improperly named glyph just for shits and giggles I suppose. *Like pointing and laughing and a kid with a broken leg*<br />
I like playing my class at the moment; I find it fun and I like that I can do competitive dps in raids. I can deal with the 8% nerf to judgment and the nerf do our very useful DoT. But this is just wrong. Seriously, roll a ret pally and see how long it takes before you're OOM on Thaddius with no spiritual attunement.</div></div><hr />

I dunno... I fail to see the point in the buffing Master Poisoner the way it was. Given the possibility that we're also getting an Envenom Glyph that will keep it from consuming DP charges, the baseline 15% increased chance to apply that Envenom provides on its own seems sufficient enough to keep a stack of 5 refreshed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, ok.. So when they are done playing with Shadow and Disc maybe they'll fix the horrible mess they made of Holy in 3.1 ;)<br />
<br />
And Hymn of Hope, should be changed so that if it only effects 3 people one of them in the priest. The only time I'd end up using this with the current wording, would be if I was OOM completely.* Most the time I use my mana regen trinkets and abilities are when I'm still at about half mana.* There would be no guarantee that I would be one of those 3 in a 25 man raid.* And screw dps casters ;)<br />
<br />
Divine Hymn isn't really that great either with the 3 target thing. Decent in a 10 man raid, not any good for 25 man raids. And even in a 10 man, having to channel this spell, it's better to use POH, COH, PoM. That's over 15k healing to up to 5 targets.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard is getting more and more retarded every day.<br />
<br />
&quot;PvE damage is too low and PvP burst too high? Let's nerf the sustained PvE damage and buff burst even further! Oh, and we free up some talent points in the Retribution tree which you can invest into nothing.&quot; ::)<br />
<br />
I do agree with the removal of SA as a general ability and moving it into deep Prot because it's a step into the right direction. It was a tanking ability from the very beginning. <br />
<br />
However, if Blizzard stops here, they completely fail at design. They MUST buff JotW now so we get our mana back, especially with Exorcism included into our rotation. Swift Retribution and JotW should also switch their place, so Holy PvP Paladins can't get their filthy hands on our mana regeneration.<br />
With SA gone, there is no longer any reason why SoB/SoM must deal feedback damage - it's f'ing retarded to be the rock bottom of the DPS charts (unless your raid sucks) while dealing massive amounts of damage to yourself. If they want us to use SoC in PvP, fine - but in that case, they should also add some utility to it which we are kinda lacking atm.</div></div><hr />

Idd, are retpallys suppose to use manapots again? and all other classes use hastepots and shizzle... :s. It's ok for holy tho, just that divine plea ATM is useless imo. 50% reduced healing in 15sec every minute. still gain alot of mana but it nerfs us to much, specially in PvP I guess due to Ogrimmar arena + manaburns, and now dispellable again.<br />
<br />
OG arena<br />
Would Poison on my pal, Im oom cuz of manaburns while feared, lets use my only cc on the priest, HAMMER OF JUSTICE, BOOM MF! Ohh, he trinketed and contrinue mana burning, gah. Oh well Ill just use divine plea, AMAG! It's crazy to heal with wound and 50% reduced healing due to divine plea. Ahh ye 2k mana I can holy shock him, AMAG I crit for 2k, nice.

I fail to see the point in the buffing Master Poisoner the way it was. Given the possibility that we're also getting an Envenom Glyph that will keep it from consuming DP charges, the baseline 15% increased chance to apply that Envenom provides on its own seems sufficient enough to keep a stack of 5 refreshed.<br />
<br />
<br />
That's because the glyph is being removed and while it's not as good as the glyph, a 100% chance to apply dp will make it stack back to 5 extremely fast.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Spiritual Attunement: Removed from trainers. It is now available deep in the Protection tree for 2 ranks at 5/10%.<br />
<br />
<br />
i can hardly believe the designers read the patch notes themselves.<br />
<br />
Well,with the Spiritual Attunement change, it totaly prevent Holy or Ret pally to do some tank jobs. Even they have some tanking gear they will be OOM in 10 seconds. That's not fun.<br />
Stupidest change ever made i say. <br />
<br />
It works like the designers do the jobs in following orders:<br />
Step1: Illumination is too powerful mana regain, Let's nerf it. 100%&gt;60%.<br />
Step2: Paladin tank need some mana regen. here comes Spiritual Attunement.<br />
Step3: Spirit changed. Druid and priest never OOM now, especialy in arenas. 0 pally in Top 100 2v2 or 3v3. Pally need some help...<br />
Step4: Here comes Divine Plea. Oh!<br />
Step5: With Divine Plea and Spiritual Attunement and Illumination, holy pally never OOM. let's nerf it.<br />
Step6: Divine Plea healing nerfed 50%, Spiritual Attunement removed.<br />
Step7: 0 pally in Top 100 2v2 or 3v3. Pally need some help....<br />
Step8: With our stupid changes that will make pally never OOM in the future patch 4.0.1, we will nerf it.<br />
With our brainless changes that make pally too weak in future patch 4.0.2, we will buff it.<br />
We just monkeying this class LoL to your players.<br />

Nothing takes effort in wow anymore, fishing was one of the few things left, even after the last decrease to the catch time and now they are gonna make it even easier. (I never enjoyed fishing tho, but i respect that something takes effort and can be a pain, if I wanted everything to be easy I would play the sims or some girlish barbie game.)<br />
<br />
<br />
Your post was rather incoherent, but I still agree with the sentiment. Fishing used to be my favorite profession b/c it was so unpopular, I was 375 on my main in BC before even the 30-&gt;20 second cast and guaranteed catches. Fish and get skillups anywhere? What kind of BS is that?<br />

<br />
no more twinks?? anyone got any more info??<br />
<br />
<br />
and<br />
<br />
<br />
Enchanting<br />
Several recipes in the 250-300 skill range have been rebalanced, and the reagent requirements have been reduced.<br />
Some enchants now have level restrictions. Note: the enchant is never removed from the item to which it's applied, however, the player no longer receives its benefit until they reach the required level. Any enchants modified in this way have had their tooltips updated.<br />
<br />
<br />
For those people interested in the above, some quick and dirty mass tradeskill tooltip scan/comparison between live and test yielded the following information about these:<br />
<br />
Mats are indeed being slashed to hell for a load of popular twink (read, 250-300) weapon and gear enchants - eg 2H agility is slated to go to only 8 Large Brilliants and 4 essences of air - no dust, no eternal essences. Mighty Intellect (22 int) is going from 15 to 6 shards, and 12 to 5 essences (still 20 dust though...). However, there is no evidence of rebalancing in the spell tooltips, only of reagent changes.<br />
<br />
Additionally, not a single existing enchanting tooltip suggests that they have a level requirement (although maybe my rather poor scan code isn't picking it up - it just scans the spell tooltips, it might appear on the effect of the enchanted weapon for all I know, contrary to what blizz suggest)<br />
<br />
There is evidence of these level requirements - not on anything to do with enchanting though, but on all the (most relevantly BC) spell threads and armor kits. Here's an excerpt from a Nethercleft item tooltip (contained in the enchant tooltip);<br />
<br />
&quot;Can only be attached to leg armor in your inventory. Wearer must be level 60 or higher.&quot;<br />
<br />
The rare leg armors require only level 50, but obviously this would render those echants inoperable for nearly all twinks in the game...</div></div><hr />

That Paladin nerfthingwhatthehell? Who gave them the weed to actually be so careless/secretive? I feel bad for Paladin players, I honestly do.<br />
<br />
But for myself, i just gotta say that i have a huge desire of chrushing someone's head right now. Me as a frost DK, sure DeathKnight's would need a nerf here and there. <br />
<br />
<br />
Howling Blast: Base damage and scaling doubled. This ability no longer deals bonus damage to targets with Frost Fever. Cooldown increased to 10 seconds. Swapped positions with Hungering Cold in the talent tree.<br />
<br />
But CRACKLYFUCKINGDOODOO :O They're really destroying a spec that i've been very comfortable with for some time now, one that actually is kinda balanced. Howling blast is the one ability that actually does some decent AoE, and now they're throwing it all further in?<br />
<br />
And what's up screwing the TG specc? 10 % Damage Reduction ?<br />
<br />
They should let the fucking talents be and stop nerfing classes that already works great.<br />
<br />
Gah, this just sucks. Hopefully they'll come to senses with all classes in time.<br />

<br />
I really hope they have a good plan for retridins cause atm they're the worst class. I cant help but wonder how they managed to screw up so much. A 10 years old kid that plays WoW would have done better job. The current retri design shows huge ignorance of game mechanics, lazyness, almost zero creativity. One could argue that the patch isnt out yet. But the fact is that Blizzard's behaviour concerning the retribution paladins during the last years, justifies this scepticism.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Avoidance trinkets are fine, but the proc is so much of a joke. 200 ish damage? On a boss that hits for upward of five digits in damage? If you take FIVE whole unavoided, unslowed hits (which tank in the world would let that debuff stay off for 10secs?) in a row with 50% avoidance, you mitigate... 1000 damage over the course of 10secs. To call that a fart in a hurricane would be too kind. Anything with an attackspeed and hitsize sufficiently adjusted to make that proc anything other than a placeholder would be completely trivialized by block. And that's with tank mechanics being at the forefront of the design process now.<br />
<br />
Now, that stamina trinket, that's fine. A fair on use ability.<br />

Anyway, can you all please stop with the whining post about patch notes that are obviously not complete yet and are changing every couple of days? They don't even reflect what is currently on the PTR.<br />
<br />
Several &quot;patch notes&quot; ago from the PTR it was the same with the Hymns for Priests where they &quot;removed from the game&quot; and made a new glyph for it. <br />
<br />
Just shut up about it, wait for the final patch notes (which will again be incomplete) and then QQ how incredibly stupid Blizz is according to you and how you can do a much better job not only at class balance but at writing notes too, because 90% of you obviously are so incredibly good at the game that they understand it much better than the people that are making it.</div></div><hr />

What I meant was it's become far easier, and with the new incentives, the quicker cast times and what have you, we fishers have gone from the four sad buggers at BlizzCon who got a shoutout for levelling it to 375, to the bloody Flavour Profession of the Month.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ah, I see it. People are invading in your special club, oh no, you poor, poor elitist. Your only pride, taken away.<br />
<br />
You see, I would agree to you if fishing was really hard to level up. But it wasn't. It was just mundane. There was no difficulty factor other than to stop yourself to do something more fun, i.e., watch the paint dry. Watching a bobber in water =/= skill. Yes, it did take determination, but so it will after the changes. It is just made more fun.</div></div><hr />

There is evidence of these level requirements - not on anything to do with enchanting though, but on all the (most relevantly BC) spell threads and armor kits. Here's an excerpt from a Nethercleft item tooltip (contained in the enchant tooltip);<br />
<br />
&quot;Can only be attached to leg armor in your inventory. Wearer must be level 60 or higher.&quot;<br />
<br />
The rare leg armors require only level 50, but obviously this would render those echants inoperable for nearly all twinks in the game...<br />
<br />
<br />
ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING????<br />
<br />
No leg enchants? That's so fucking dumb, anyone can get a leg enchant. If you don't have the balls to gear your twink/alt properly, why do the rest of us deserve to be forced down to your broke ass level?<br />

Now that it is removed they can easily tweak our mana regen through JotW, and they will.<br />
<br />
Here is the blue post : http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/15661689639-spiritual-attunement-removed-on-ptr.html<br />
<br />
Stop crying you stupid paladins, this is in fact an EXCELLENT CHANGE for us. Just just a few days to see what changes they are making for our mana regen.<br />
<br />
<br />
Well they have to boost it to 35% at least -&gt; that should give ret. enough mana to make 8+ full rotation withou plea.<br />
But If they remove SA and JotW remain on 15%... we are screwd in PvE (no SA + 15% JotW + Exorcism added to rotatin = no mana after 4th rotation)<br />
//I didnt count &quot;limited available&quot; abilites like Avenging Wrath and Hammer of Wrath<br />

I feel the same as you. I am only missing 4 formulas from Enchanting to have the full collection, and, whilst I never really enchant them any more, I felt kinda proud that my collection was almost complete. Oh well, I suppose it will help with me getting the last 4.<br />

very true, sorry didnt think in a healers point of view, but being ret i hate to be dependable on healers to gain mana because of Sob's recoil and SA, wich is a very bad mechanism for mana reg. but u are right, and holy palas will need a mana reg mechanic aswell, but blizzard always loves to screw with us :-[<br />

and dont forget, they are making mana spring and BoW non stackable, as far as i understand. apparently pally buffs are too unique...yet they decided to make BoK a trainable skill again over a tree skill since noone was picking it up with talent points and it wasnt being used...<br />
<br />
sounds mildly contradictory to me.<br />
If you ask me, seems like they are on the way to breaking paladins a bit.</div></div><hr />

Spirit affecting DPS in the future?<br />
I said that a proper benefit of Spirit to mages would be for it to affect dps. But I cautioned that you should not expect your dps to go up overnight because of this change. Perhaps I was being too cautious, but I know that at least some players are hoping to get free dps out of the deal. The problem we are trying to fix here is not &quot;mage dps is too low.&quot; The problem we are trying to fix is &quot;mage gear has spirit, which doesn't do much for them except for a small bit of in-combat mana regen.&quot;<br />
<br />
If you think mage dps is too low, that is a separate topic, but we would still be unlikely to fix that by suddenly giving you 10 dps for every point of spirit on your gear.<br />
<br />
[...] I said mage A (little to no Spirit on gear) and mage B (Spirit on gear) would have similar dps. Currently A has higher dps because she has no &quot;wasted stats.&quot;<br />
<br />
I probably ended up confusing some people because I was trying to be too cautious in saying do not expect mage B &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; mage A. (Source)&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot; Mage (Skills List / Talent + Glyph Calc.)<br />
* Mirror Image: The images no longer cast Polymorph.<br />
Fire<br />
* Improved Scorch: Increased critical strike chance is now 1%, down from 2% per application of the Improved Scorch effect.<br />
Frost<br />
* Winter’s Chill: Increased critical strike chance is now 1%, down from 2% per application of Winter’s Chill.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
So what you're saying is, b/c of scorch and chill's DECREASE, you're taking mages off the top of the DPS charts in 5 man part, 10 man raid, or 25 man raid, unless they have the images out? And only then we our DPS pick up for what? 30 seconds or less b/c the images are so weak. Then you're going to TRY to make up for it bad adding an ever so slight increase to spell damage from spirit. Winter's Chill was the bread and butter of a frost mage's DPS. We don't hit as hard as Fire mages, so we NEED that crit bonus. Arcane has tons of possible instant casts, so their damage is up anyway. I agree with a previous poster. If we personally build these talents up, why not take the extra crit % away from the RAID but NOT the mage???? Where is OUR personal buff now?<br />

LOL?<br />
pretty sure your on crack?<br />
<br />
incase you havent noticed because you are too busy playing your frost dk....pally tanks have a bit of problem on occassion with TANKING, be it mana.<br />
<br />
let say when your tanking as a dk, you run outta rune power in like lets say a 2 minute fight, and ur struggling to get it back up to maintain threat. that would be like a prot pally. Get over yourself, what does fixing a prot pally have to do with anything involving a dk? get a grip.<br />
<br />
(and just a fyi, all they have done is nurf ret and holy since the start of wotlk...so like i said, get a grip)</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gadirm</div><div class="date">2009-03-18, 02:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Arcane has tons of possible instant casts, so their damage is up anyway.<br />
<br />
<br />
Uhm..? Have I missed something, since when did Arcane have &quot;tons of possible instant casts&quot;? Arcane have one instant cast if specced for it (51 pt talent) and one that is an AoE spell, ofc we also have PoM which will make the next spell (with less than 10 sec cast time) instant, but the last one is on a fairly long cooldown.<br />
<br />
Want to compare that to Frost or Fire spec?<br />
Fire = Fire blast, single target instant cast, not talented; Firestarter, AoE instant cast proc, talented; Hot Streak, Single target instant cast, talented; Living bomb, Single target instant cast, talented. (By my count thats one more than arcane spec have)<br />
Frost = Frost nova, AoE instant cast, not talented; Ice Lance, Single target instant cast, not talented; Brain Freeze, Single target instant cast, talented. (Equal to Arcane by my count of 3 instants)<br />
<br />
Maybe that you take in calculation the very many utility spells that arcane have? Like counterspell, spellsteal and such as well? Then why not also take in consideration all the instant different armors used? and Arcane Int and Arcane Brilliance?<br />
<br />
Lets just be fair about that most of Fire or Frost is based on RNG atm while arcane is more balanced, both fire and frost atm are surviving on either critting often or having high critnumbers so i can understand that when Blizzard decide to take away 5% crit, magecommunity tend to whine about killing the class, the 3.1 patch is still under development and should be treated such, not by having a ton of doomsday prophets running around with their panties in a twist, but just stay cool and if you have any real facts on how this will affect the class then show it to the devs instead of complaining on a public forum that is not a Blizzard relateded one.</div></div><hr />
