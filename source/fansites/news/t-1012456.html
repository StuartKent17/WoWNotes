I on the other hand am guessing that the orange one is a 100% drop on normal mode and a small chance at RF, and Lifebinder's handmaid 100% hc</div></div><hr />

the blazing drake is a mount drop, you can find it in the loot section of the dungeon journal, i suspect though that it is 100% drop on normal<br />

<br />
Not necessarily.<br />
<br />
There have been a few PTRs where the Blues have done this at least twice. <br />
<br />
It's done when they want to do stress testing of a particular new feature. Nothing motives people to get on the PTR more then being able to play with or against actual Blues.</div></div><hr />

The timing for this patch will take 12-20-11 into account and thus will launch late November to early December. This will ensure 4.3 is in full swing for that date.

How did i know the whole comments would be filled with mount rabble. Incoming elitist threads moaning that normal raiders get a mount too......<br />
<br />
Actually you've got a lot of &quot;wanna look cool elitist bashers&quot; moaning that the heroic one is of a diferent color and they won't get it at least on the 1st month (before the to the ground nerfs, and will get in MoP easily).<br />
<br />
Now ppl care even about the color of what others can get that they can't...<br />

<br />
They probably taking into account that LK didn't drop a &quot;Reins of the LK: This is a very fast Scourge guy&quot;, neither Yogg dropped a &quot;Reins of the Old God: This is a very fast Tentacle&quot;, so, no reason for a dragon to drop... a drake...<br />
<br />
Not that Malygos, Sartharion, Onyxia, etc. dropped drakes and... oh wait!!!</div></div><hr />

I'm actually not against more drake mounts, but Blizzard constantly re-purposing the old, low-res drake model is kinda sad. Pasting on a bunch of spikes, frills, and horns, then dipping it in a new coat of paint just doesn't cut it.<br />

After all the Raven Lord was a reskin of a raptor, so it IS obvious that Blizz have the ability to reskin an old model into something totally new altogether.And heres my own personal suggestion to pitch to you for an idea of a mount, how about 'No Mount!' Instead of having a mount, you just... fly! xDMaybe this could be a profession based mount, probably Enchanting would be most suited for this style of idea. So you could imbue a trinket (only saying this, coz we dont enchant this item with anything, so its available for such a thing) with a tonne of enchanting materials and it will give you the ability to just hit space and zoooooooooom!Oh, and i dont hate the new mounts btw, im just disappointed to see its another drake again. The new mounts DO look good imo.</div></div><hr />
