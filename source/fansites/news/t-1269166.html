<br />
Lol, except fire wasn't OP at all since the nerf back at the start of 5.1. On live it's middle to high/middle of the pack when you get lucky with crits. All this is going to do is make it harder for new level 90 mages and those not in full BiS gear to play the spec effectively. They might as well just scrap the talent completely at this rate and just think of a better way to help fire play effectively without something like this that scales too strongly at high gear levels.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's actually not about being OP! Surprise! It's that mages were OP by poor design and instead of fixing the problem they're turning a dial instead of addressing fundamental spec problems. Amazing what happens when you aren't in a dick-measuring contest about who can have less complaints.</div></div><hr />

All 3 specs, especially affliction, are far and away some of the best dps specs in the game in all heroic raids. Affliction is the best spec, no contest, in all raid sizes and on nearly all fights.<br />

When they nerfed fire after 5.1 it promptly went to middle of the pack while affliction has only gotten better as people gear up more. Destruction does extremely well in heroic gear. Shut up.</div></div><hr />

We're talking about the destruction spec here, not affliction. In live it is the worst PvE lock spec, primarily due to the constant nerfs we get from PvP QQ. We are turned away from groups for choosing to play this suboptimal spec. If what you say about heroic gear for us is true then you must know an extremely lucky lock that got carried up to that point. Destruction needs buffs in order to reach affliction standards.</div></div><hr />

Sorry to bother but lock is the top class. You are just playing a wrong spec. Seems silly to play demo/destro if you are the kind of people who only plays if being a top class and that would be affliction.</div></div><hr />

I agree. You can't balance every class, and you can't balance every talent to make them all equal. it's not possible. The talent worked fine, they are nerfing it for stupid reasons. Because a warlock is &quot;suppose&quot; to have a pet out. Stupid, the talent doesn't need to be nerfed, instead they should buff the other talents to make them more competitive.<br />

Destro is actually getting buffed. The current notes say a reduction by 4% to incinerate and conflagrate, but that is after they buffed those abilities by 20%. So it's just a nerf to the previous buff.</div></div><hr />

And, on a side note, I don't think a complete spec redesign in the middle of the expansion (that many of you are suggesting for arcane mages) is the right way to go: It requires a lot of tuning and you can't foresee how it works without a huge playerbase to test it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's mathematically impossible to create perfect scaling for every ability with multiple stats and various bossfight-types factored in.<br />
Stupid whining like this is one of the reasons Blizzard hesitates to give SPriest decent haste scaling. They are aware that scaling too well and thus being nerfed every tier tends to create more drama than scaling poorly and being buffed each tier.</div></div><hr />

And you're one of the people who is probably complaining about these classes being &quot;OP&quot;, because you're class (I'll assume a rogue or paladin) isn't on top of the charts currently in any category.<br />
<br />
One of the nerfs to the warlocks isn't because it makes them &quot;OP&quot;. They are nerfing GoS because a warlock is &quot;suppose&quot; to use a pet. So they are wanting to nerf that talent to make it on par with the other 2, instead of trying to buff the other 2 to make them on par with GoS. I can't remember what post, or who posted it, but a warlock should be able to sacrifice a pet. Warlocks are masters of dark magic, and &quot;don't care&quot; about the pet they use and are glad to sacrifice it because it will make them &quot;stronger&quot;. Warlocks are not hunters, and shouldn't have to have a pet if they don't want one.</div></div><hr />

No one is forcing you to use a pet, you just choose to play the most optimal spec.<br />

<br />
I have a feeling Oondasta will be nerfed before it goes live. It really isn't going to work with the mechanics it has, and the fact that the other boss can reward you with *tier* pieces which are better pieces, I don't see many people giving a crap about this boss if it remains hard. The types of guilds that can kill this boss are going to have no need for 522 pieces that aren't even very good after the first week.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">crimsonhead</div><div class="date">2013-03-01, 12:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Why are you always complaining?<br />
You know your class is OP when you think it's ok as it is. Seriously, complaining about disc / arcane / lock(yes, all of the specs) means that you are the clueless one, not GC.<br />
<br />
And, on a side note, I don't think a complete spec redesign in the middle of the expansion (that many of you are suggesting for arcane mages) is the right way to go: It requires a lot of tuning and you can't foresee how it works without a huge playerbase to test it.<br />
<br />
Me? Clueless? What are you talking about? Pet sacrificing is nothing new, AT ALL. We had it in vanilla, had it in BC --&gt; In fact it was the optimal spec for raiding, sacrificing our succubus for awesome SB damage. Pet use really hit the field around LK and Cata. Blizz gave us the option again and AGAIN they failed how to properly balance it. Whose fault is that? Am I the one that designed it? Did I think that it would be a good idea? Hell no, it was GC and his team of fails. I don't care about affliction and demo, I play to be top dps (and usually am as of now) but even in 5.2 I'm not, I'll still be destro. Why? Because it's awesome. You tell me what it's like to crit for over 400k, 500k. It's amazing, unlike anything. <br />
<br />
Then take it away. How will that make you feel? It's blizzards constant bait and switch. This all began in BC and xfered over to Lich King with that ridiculous conflag buff that they hotfixed OVERNIGHT. When locks get some good, even great, it's always short lived. Warlocks are NOT a pet class, we are a minion using class. We are not centered around pets like hunters are. We used to be when our pets had spells that worked with our spells and spec, but that is not the case anymore. I don't want a pet because blizzard doesn't know how to create fights appropriate for my pet to path, attack, move, survive and dps, optimally. If they gave locks the type of customization to a degree hunters get, I'd be happy, but that's not going to happen.<br />
<br />
I'm not clueless, no warlock is. Open your eyes and figure out what's happening instead of spewing nonsense.</div></div><hr />

<br />
One of the nerfs to the warlocks isn't because it makes them &quot;OP&quot;. They are nerfing GoS because a warlock is &quot;suppose&quot; to use a pet. So they are wanting to nerf that talent to make it on par with the other 2, instead of trying to buff the other 2 to make them on par with GoS. I can't remember what post, or who posted it, but a warlock should be able to sacrifice a pet. Warlocks are masters of dark magic, and &quot;don't care&quot; about the pet they use and are glad to sacrifice it because it will make them &quot;stronger&quot;. Warlocks are not hunters, and shouldn't have to have a pet if they don't want one.<br />
<br />
Guess what? My main is a priest, I started raiding as holy and it's pretty good. Then switched to discipline without a clue on how it worked, only to find out that's just insane... and I only raid 10m.<br />
They ARE op. I don't care about the single mechanincs, if a class is broken they must fix it somehow.</div></div><hr />

It's easy to get caught up in the numbers surrounding the Sac nerf, and it's a legitimate issue, but there are other things about this that are concerning as well.<br />
<br />
<br />
My problem with the way the talent is being treated is this:<br />

&quot;If anything, this talent should be rare.&quot;<br />

<br />
In Ghostcrawler's world, Sacrifice is a talent that is supposed to be legitimately bad to take.<br />
<br />
I very much doubt that the latest round of nerfs are any way of really trying to balance anything---They're an attempt to make the class fit his own conception of what Warlocks are supposed to be.<br />
<br />
The end goal isn't to make the three tiers roughly balanced in terms of DPS tuning. It apparently isn't even to make the three tiers roughly balanced in terms of popularity. Unfortunately, if you're a fan of Sacrifice [even] on a conceptual level, Ghostcrawler doesn't think you're playing the class correctly.<br />

In exchange for a Pyro nerf. Any nerf at all is mind boggling.</div></div><hr />
