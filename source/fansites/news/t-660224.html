<meta name="description" content="PvP Realm Restriction Removed 
As we've already discussed, we’re in the process of developing a new service for World of Warcraft that will allow players to change their faction from Alliance to Horde or Horde to Alliance. To prepare for this new service, we've removed the restriction that prevents players from creating both Horde and Alliance characters on a PvP realm.

Cough PvE realms cough.<br />
<br />
Edit: I think a LOT of people are confusing what this means. it just means you can have both horde and Alliance characters from the same account on the same PvP server, NOT, like someone said, that Horde and Alliance would share chat channels!<br />
That is laughable.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cask</div><div class="date">2009-08-05, 01:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This could be interesting..<br />
<br />
Many servers (much like my own) where a faction greatly outnumbers the opposite, may likely see a even worse scenarios due to transfers (Horde -&gt; Alliance, and vice versa).<br />
<br />
With the Wintergrasp change, Alliance on my realm will be even worse. I highly doubt there's 120 active WG'ers for each game, not to mention at off-peak times. Massive amounts of Horde camping approx. 5 alliance at the GY for WG-rank2 for 20minutes is not fun.<br />
<br />
Although this may be great news to some (Myself included, since i've wanted to play with some alliance friends myself for several years, just never getting around to leveling a character high enough) many will dislike this.<br />
<br />
Will be interesting to see how much they'll charge for this service.<br />
<br />
Soar.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just what i was thinking o.O <br />
<br />
Im just extremely skeptical about all of this, i mean it all looks good but i don't know, humm ahwells should leave blizzard to it there used to running a multibillion pound company, and usually (in the end) they get it right :)</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Herculon</div><div class="date">2009-08-05, 01:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Haha...this will be fun.<br />
<br />
All I read is horde QQ...you know you being tards, now its coming back to bite you in the arse. I have a few Horde on my list that I will PST when I log on...in fact there are some Horde on my realm that have been targeted specifically for being campers....they gonna get tons of hate messages. Blizz better increase the size of our ignor limit.<br />
<br />
It certainly will change your attitude towards the oposing faction on your realm, if you show disrespect by killing an aposing player while he is on a mob, expect the flames...and not just 1, i'de get my guild into it aswell.<br />
<br />
This could also be a bad thing for WG, since we plan our attack/deffence. There could be some spys in our midsts...but I suppose it will go both ways.</div></div><hr />

On my main's server we already have that happen via second accounts and nobody actually even bothers to defend. &quot;Oh Thrall/Magni is dead again? Oh wells.&quot; <br />
<br />
I mean the faction change thing is something that people have been begging for ever since the start and now they're finally letting it happen, but in order to do so they need to make this minor change of an arbitrary mechanic. It's completely useless now. The naysayers have been saving for the last 2 years that Blizzard killed World PvP and yet ... Now this apparently hurts world PvP.

Well really, Stop the QQ, One smurf less or more is something i could not care lesser about, If you QQ so much about this then leave the Game and face it, We know you will be back again within 2 month's of time anyways. Thats just fact. <br />
<br />
Of course this change will fear people and they will QQ about it, And some will just be happy too be able too have cross faction character on same server, Whatever.. What make this change so insane bad than the game already is. - Peace out<br />

Alliance Pally moves to Alliance guild [cha-ching]<br />

No, WoW is about money. This is a very good change for people like myself who can't be arsed to reroll horde or buy a second account JUST to play with some horde friends every now and then. I really couldn't care less if they would merge horde and alliance altogether, I've got battlegrounds if I want &quot;war&quot;.</div></div><hr />

A lot of the achievements for Ulduar haven't been done by a lot of raiding guilds. Yogg+0 is the hardest encounter in the history of WoW. The difficulty is there if you want it.<br />
<br />
I think that they shouldn't make the entire raid hard - they should allow players to customize it to make it hard for them. <br />
<br />
If you don't like that, GTFO, or deal with it and stop QQing on MMO-Champion.</div></div><hr />

You know what? Wait till 3.3, buy on ebay full t10 BiS gear character for you, albo buy some more for your friends and after that keep sitting in major city with minds of succesful coz you hav achived everytghing you could in this game - you got best in slot gear, you got race that u wanted, you got class that you wanted, you got realm and faction that you wanted - but now tell me where did you put efford to earn this?</div></div><hr />

. Give a crap player good gear and he'll still be crap. This is also a good way to gear up alts without having to go through the steep curve of tiers(aswell as promising recruits with lesser gear)<br />
Why no1 is complaining bout low difficulty in wotlk?<br />

. There were more than plenty challenging hardmodes in Ulduar, I really don't see how it can be an argument.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">darkthunder</div><div class="date">2009-08-05, 02:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well.. What is the matter now by choosing ally or horde side? If you can choose both..<br />
<br />
Take a simple example:<br />
<br />
Humans: Starts out in a lush green forest, which eventually leads to a wide open zone with farms, beaches etc<br />
Undead: Starts out in a dead village, questing around in a dead forest and eventually leads to an even deader forest etc<br />
<br />
It could be a simple matter of taste, but the basic reasoning for removing the faction restriction on PVP realms is ofcourse to allow for the faction change feature which will eventually become available. Would be a bit odd to try and change faction &quot;within&quot; the same realm while having multiple characters of your origin faction. Up until this change, if you had characters that were Alliance and wanted to make one of them a Horde character, it wouldn't work. With the restriction removed, the feature is wide open. I suspect the faction change function isn't too far away.</div></div><hr />

COZ they ar PVE? Dont you rly get difference betwen server where you /wave to your enemy and server where you kill enemy? ( Anyways I dont get how can you play game bout PvP on such retarded realms as PvE - it just doesnt appeal to WoW story.<br />

Right now Im off for sleep. I dont want to argue, but I rly didnt know that majority of WoW community is for completly easy-mode. Looks like Ive picked wrong game to play.

LOL WUT<br />
<br />
I have no idea what you are saying. Why would I ever go on eBay to buy a character? ???<br />
<br />
If you're implying that Icecrown is going to be as easy as buying a toon on eBay, you're stupid. No way in hell would Blizzard make Arthas, the most hardcore, powerful, and awesome enemy in WoW currently, a pushover. If anything he will be HARDER than Yogg+0. <br />
<br />
Oh, and even if I get the maximum gear, and all the classes/races to level 80, I'd still find something fun to do in WoW. I don't live by the bullcrap cycle of raiding, BG, arena, raiding, heroics, BG, arena, rinse, repeat - I find my own way to play this game. People like you that think that raiding and arena are the only things in this game are just sadly mistaken, and I really pity you.</div></div><hr />

I don't know how this creates &quot;completly [sic] easy-mode&quot;. You're an idiot. It's just allowing us to create Alliance characters on PvP servers that all are Hordies are on, and vice-versa. This doesn't change the difficulty of the game in anyway.</div></div><hr />

So you're one of those faggot ass pussies that can't fight, so you create a level 1 toon to spam them 3 times before they LOL at you and put you on ignore? lol that's Alliance for you. <br />

PvE realms have had this forever and noone's complaining there. Get a mod that automatically ignores all lvl 1-10 whispers and you'll be care free of QQ from the guy you just ganked.<br />
<br />
Personally I like the change.<br />
<br />
This lets me stay on my beloved server should I ever choose to change faction. Besides I can see myself transferring an alt to the other side to play with people I've met and learned to like over irc and realm forums. Some of us actually like the servers we play on (both factions on the server) and don't want to end up on a different server just because we decided to give the other faction a go.<br />

Stop whining about every little thing. Look at the positives and learn to embrace changes.<br />

All I read is horde QQ...you know you being tards, now its coming back to bite you in the arse.

Blizz better increase the size of our ignor limit.<br />
<br />
It certainly will change your attitude towards the oposing faction on your realm, if you show disrespect by killing an aposing player while he is on a mob, expect the flames...and not just 1, i'de get my guild into it aswell.<br />
<br />
This could also be a bad thing for WG, since we plan our attack/deffence. There could be some spys in our midsts...but I suppose it will go both ways.<br />

I say you get what you deserve. If you disrupt other peoples questing/leveling then I dont see why they shouldnt disrupt yours with spam and flaming.<br />

If Im on my alt and Im a lower level and you kill me once, thats fine, kill me twice, I get on my main and gank you till you spirit res. If you get your main, ill gank him too.<br />
<br />
I know that doesnt make me better than you, but it hopefully makes you realise how it can interupt your leveling/questing. Be carefull of who you gank or camp...it could just waste alot of your play time, and now thanks to Blizz you can take alot of flaming aswell.</div></div><hr />

People have strong opinions on what it means to be Horde, what it means to be Alliance. People get into heated debates on forums over each sides' moral justification for various actions - some people it seems genuinely loathe Varian or Garrosh, or have some serious opinions on Thrall's policies, the Forsaken, etc.<br />
<br />
The simple act of ganking/getting ganked can really intensify all of this. <br />
<br />
Not being able to communicate with the other side is brilliant from a social psychological standpoint. It allows players to project imagined personality traits onto others, in the same way cars contribute to road rage by preventing human body language that may include apologies and reconciliations, among other things.<br />
<br />
In WoW this makes for a real sense of Us versus Them. You get some strong faction pride going on. It's intense, and not what everyone wants. But it's really pretty damn cool, and I think allowing even this much communication, whether people flame or play nice, diminishes it.</div></div><hr />

Now I will gank '' Thelorddark'' the Night-Elf Deathknight. 5 minutes later. I will have a lvl 1 spamming me.<br />

If you were referring to me, then there are a few faults with your post:<br />
<br />
#1: I don't have any characters named &quot;Thelorddark&quot;. All of my characters that I play on from time to time, are listed in my signature.<br />
#2: I have no alliance characters (atleast none that i've played on recently). My only alliance character is an old retired 41 Dwarf Warrior. I retired him when I found out playing Horde was more fun.<br />
#3: Being 25 (soon 26 years of age), I don't consider myself a &quot;kid&quot; anymore and haven't been for several years. Furthermore, you don't know me, so don't presume that you do.<br />
<br />
Lastly: Why is this such a big deal when PVE players have had this in place since &quot;beta&quot; ? Youre still allowed to go gank them in the contested zone, and if they happen to relog, create a level 1 character and start spamming you, rightclick, report spam. Problem solved. If you need a more permanent solution, add to ignore. Again, problem solved. Thank you, and goodnight.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So what did they do? lift the restriction, it makes sense, so it works for everyone. I dont really like this new feature, given that there is a pretty strong representation of horde and alliance now (colliseum) and this new feature was announced right around there. <br />
<br />
Doesn't matter though, if you have a friend who is from another faction, and you can't be bothered with making a complete new character to level up and play with, you can use this feature.</div></div><hr />

I was under the assumption that you can't do that on PvE servers before this change because you can't buy out your own auctions with your other characters. Or did they change that too?<br />

This change will make Guild Recruiting (or Poaching) easier once the Faction Change system is implemented, and I don't want to imagine how one faction will try to poach members of the other...</div></div><hr />

Besides, the whole Horde VS Alliance thing is dead, and has been for the longest time. If you want faction VS faction, play WAR or something. In WoW, it's no more than a broken, beaten and old franchise. Just like the PvP.</div></div><hr />

GTFO. Now.<br />
<br />
Seriously. I can't believe that anyone would call this a reason to quit WoW. If you really are concerned about people you ganked flaming you on your faction, /IGNORE. USE IT. /REPORT. USE IT.<br />
<br />
What kills me is people saying that Blizzard is doing this for the money. WHAT THE FUCK. This PvP server change is FREE; the faction change service won't be. To be honest, I don't really care about the latter, but it's there for people that want it.<br />
<br />
Blizzard gives you enough motherfucking content already. WoW with all the expansions+ updates is now like 17 gigabytes without add-ons or anything, and you are getting all these updates/minor changes for FREE. Shut up and stop whining about what you get for free. If you don't like them, GTFO and play some game where they do absolutely nothing to change gameplay, like, oh, say, Guild Wars, or Maplestory. See how fun that crap is.<br />
<br />
I'm so tired of the QQ whenever Blizzard just changes something, whether it be minor or major. Just stop it.</div></div><hr />

Blizz transformed the best MMO for Players in the best money making MMO for Activision-Blizzard.<br />

If you disrupt other peoples questing/leveling then I dont see why they shouldnt disrupt yours with spam and flaming.<br />
<br />
I see it like this:<br />
If Im on my alt and Im a lower level and you kill me once, thats fine, kill me twice, I get on my main and gank you till you spirit res. If you get your main, ill gank him too.<br />
<br />
I know that doesnt make me better than you, but it hopefully makes you realise how it can interupt your leveling/questing. Be carefull of who you gank or camp...it could just waste alot of your play time, and now thanks to Blizz you can take alot of flaming aswell.<br />
<br />
<br />
They can disrupt my questing by ganking me when I least expect it or by bringing their friends - isn't that what PEE VEE PEE about: killing the other person? Flaming is just stupid - generally people with dual accounts who insist on flaming me get an extra helping of being camped and ganked with potential dura loss (by me getting them to 1% with 2 mobs on em). If you want to fight me - that's fine, but flaming me is juvenile and will get you nothing more than a ton of wasted time.<br />

Secondly, I'm not happy about any changes they've made ever since Vanilla, except for the arenas, maybe. <br />
I'm one of the few nostalgic people that miss vanilla when you really had to put the bone in order to achieve something, unlike now when you get everything served. On the other hand, this is perfectly understandable, we're talking about a multi-billion dollar business and profits &gt; everything else, unfortunately, so it's logical why this game gets easier and easier expansion, after expansion.<br />
It would be fair to create some sort of voting system, that can't be cheated by players who possess more than one account (I don't care how that system should look like and it's not my business, its theirs because they are charging our money) and let the majority decide. <br />
That could work on the most crucial decisions they make that affect the game and that way we would have a democratic way of doing this.<br />

create a horde alt, each day log on and search for your new friend. If you notice he is out and about farming, make a note of this, log your main and bring some more friends. Pay him a visit. <br />

Now everytime I kill a bitch I gotta put up with their whining. Or I will kill someone who has an 80 on my faction and thinks that makes them exempt from me ganking them so they begin personal vendetta's.<br />

As we've already discussed, we&#8217;re in the process of developing a new service for World of Warcraft that will allow players to change their faction from Alliance to Horde or Horde to Alliance. To prepare for this new service, we've removed the restriction that prevents players from creating both Horde and Alliance characters on a PvP realm. For more information on our Faction Change service, please visit the following link.<br />

It takes 2 minutes or so after the vid, then you spent 30 seconds spamming<br />
<br />
<br />
Why would you waste 2 1/2 minutes to annoy someone and accomplish nothing? If you can't deal with being ganked on a PvP server...well, then reroll. If you can't stand being ganked on a PvE server then...unflag..</div></div><hr />

I rolled pvp realm before battlegrounds even exist, not because I wanted to gank opposite faction into oblivion but because I wanted to have opportunity to pvp when I want to. I hate all stupid morons with slogans like RED=DEAD, ROLL PVE NUB and so. Sadly difference is not in gameplay but in morons who came from Quake III and things about wow like about deathmatch.<br />
<br />
About this change, I think it is a good thing. You could start trial account and spam horde when they ganked you as much as you wanted. There is ignore, report spam and also you can open ticket when someone annoy you. Let's see how it works after few weeks when people starts to be used to it.</div></div><hr />

All I read is horde QQ...you know you being tards, now its coming back to bite you in the arse. I have a few Horde on my list that I will PST when I log on...in fact there are some Horde on my realm that have been targeted specifically for being campers....they gonna get tons of hate messages. Blizz better increase the size of our ignor limit.<br />
<br />
It certainly will change your attitude towards the oposing faction on your realm, if you show disrespect by killing an aposing player while he is on a mob, expect the flames...and not just 1, i'de get my guild into it aswell.<br />
<br />
This could also be a bad thing for WG, since we plan our attack/deffence. There could be some spys in our midsts...but I suppose it will go both ways.<br />

Then he says we are getting all updates and changes for free. ROFL?<br />
What the fuck do you think we are paying a monthly fee for? Nothing? No, we pay just so we can get all the new content and updates. And most of us who pay don't want stupid and retarded changes like this. Faction changes is the most retarded idea Blizzard have ever come up with since Death Knights. Fact.<br />
<br />
The reason people started playing on PvP-realms was so we could concentrate on having all our characters on the same side, not running around with half Alliance and half Horde...<br />
And everyone who says&quot; GET A ADDON RETARD OMG OMG NOT HAR DHAHHA LOL STOP PLAYING THEN&quot;<br />
I don't want to be forced to use a addon just so I can play a game which I pay for every month.<br />

<br />
Way back (Emphasis on the way) when there actually was a thing called Horde VS Alliance, Blizzard didn't want people to create characters on opposing races to &quot;scout&quot; where Horde/Alliance warbands where going to attack next, and stuff like that.<br />
<br />
In addition to that, they wanted to keep the rift between Horde and Alliance at a maximum so it would feel like you're actually at war with the opposing race. Cuba crisis etc :P<br />
<br />
Now that war, world pvp and all that stuff is gone, and we're at world of letshugandbefriendscraft (Which isn't so bad and negative as I might make it sound), it's no need for this anymore.<br />
<br />
*shrug* I kinda miss when everything was new and world pvp still excisted :)<br />

<br />
I was farming in Heartghlen (WPL - you know, where the graveyards is like OVER 9000 miles away...) with my human fury-warrior. Most of the time it was quiet out there - no ganking, only a few people farming (the most favourite farmspot was thyrs hand back then). When i arrived there on that day there were 3 players: a Troll Hunter and another Human Warrior. I started killing some mobs and suddenly the hunter attacked me. With Fury-Spec and full PVE-Gear i stood no chance and he killed me about 2-3 times, then stopped attacking. Well, ok, that wouldn't have been a problem for me - after all i was playing on a PVP-server. The thing that made me mad was the other human warrior. Not only didn't he help me, but he watched the hunter killing me. I asked him for help and he just said &quot;sorry, nothing personal, but i'm together in teamspeak with him, i can't help you&quot;. I didn't know what to say...it was frustrating. <br />
<br />
I always hated, when someone teamed up with members of the &quot;enemy&quot; AGAINST the own faction...<br />
I understand that WoW has never REALLY been a _roleplaying_ game. But I can't understand why Blizzard has to change the only things that have remotely something to do with roleplaying...<br />
I'm not playing the game right now due to exams - this is _another_ change that will keep me away for the future...<br />
<br />
PS: and no, I don't want to play on a RP-server - that is something completely different.</div></div><hr />

If you regret this or any decision made by Blizzard, consider expressing your feelings, but also try to say why you think this decision is a bad thing.<br />
<br />
Saying &quot;omg this sucks&quot; because others do and you think it's cool reduces your credibility and value for this community. Some of you already have the debatable 'honor' of being known as useless forum trolls.<br />

And having 90% horde population on 1 server and 10% alliance, is not entirely good for the game. Or, having 5% horde and 95% alliance, in some other cases. So, for that, they came with this ideea and i would say, it will clearly rebalance the population of horde / alliance - sure here can be commented a lot on the fact that is another way for blizzard to get some more money.</div></div><hr />

As we've already discussed, we’re in the process of developing a new service for World of Warcraft that will allow players to change their faction from Alliance to Horde or Horde to Alliance. To prepare for this new service, we've removed the restriction that prevents players from creating both Horde and Alliance characters on a PvP realm. For more information on our Faction Change service, please visit the following link.<br />

Oh hai Mr. E-Thug..<br />

Its never been pvp to run up level 80 and rightclick a level 20.. Thats not pvp.. Thats being a dick ;)<br />
<br />
6 x level 80 versus one level 80, is pvp.. 1v1 is pvp.. All bgs apart from Av is pvp.. Arena is pvp.. Ganking outside raid instances = pvp.. But not killing someone 60 levels lower than you :)<br />
<br />
And with this chance i sure will transfer to a PvE realm even though ive been on pvp since day one.. but to avoid getting pissed in idiots that go.. Leave this farming spot or i will gank you with a level 80 ;)</div></div><hr />

There are three thing you can do when a change occurs:<br />
1-Love it<br />
2-Hate it but still accept it<br />
3-Whine<br />
<br />
Sadly, you have chosen option 3, not mentioning attacking other posters personally...<br />
<br />
Ganking is part of a PvP server's daily routines, and if you don't like it, you should have rolled on a PvE servers...<br />
It doesn't matter what you think about PvP, Blizzard and the majority of WoW players consider World PvP a very real form of PvP. Else it wouldn't exist...<br />
<br />
So you called me a troll, a fanboy and said something about pitying me...<br />
<br />
People like you are the ones who should be pitied, making a huge deal about a game and crying about changes you don't like...<br />

1-Deal with it<br />
2-Provide real arguments to why you don't like it instead of spamming BS<br />
3-Leave<br />

Nothing prevents you from creating an alt and spamming the other faction, just because you can.<br />
<br />
Tracking a player of the opposing faction has become incredibly easy.<br />
<br />
The unique economic situation created by just having a neutral auction house to barter with a hostile opposing faction will disappear.<br />
<br />
These all might be pretty poor reasons, but the people saying &quot;I can't see the bad side of this.&quot; really aren't thinking properly.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Why is this needed anyways? Just don't allow PvP characters to factionchange. Just because you can do something doesn't mean you should. I'm not a fan, though I can just see the dollar signs in Blizzard's eye as every horde pvper switches to a human.</div></div><hr />

Not even close.. All depending on what class you play.. Ive been playing Hunter, rogue and paladin as main, all att different times.. And ive had situations where ive been against more than 6 and still made it out of it alive ;)<br />

<br />
no its 10<br />
i have ten on one server and nine on another can still create one more<br />
<br />
anyway just read the news and think its stupid<br />
I mean people could create alliance and horde on the same server if they have two accounts... I came across some people who did... but still its weird<br />
<br />
you can now gank your guild buddies if you want to and whats the point in doing pvp now... I dont get it... what the point in winning wintergrasp for the horde if you have a character of the opposing faction on the server... &quot;oh wintergrasp is now in possesion of alliance... gonna switch to my alliance alt... battle for wintergrasp is coming up... do I want to attack or defend?&quot; no its just stupid<br />
<br />
Then again whats the point in not being able to understand the language of the other faction? people will now switch to their alt... everyone can communicate with everyone doesnt matter if alliance or horde<br />
and I can see people switching to their alts telling the player who just ganked them to leave them alone<br />
<br />
I mean its fine for normal realms but it just doesnt work on a pvp realm</div></div><hr />

Apart from obvious things the poster stated such as vanish, I often find my self being able to bring down 1 of attackers, which a level 20 got no chance of. Sure you dont have chance to survive 1vs5, unless you are full arena geared hybrid, and they are new dinged, but you can put up with a fight, unless you face stunlock classes.</div></div><hr />

You have been killed multiple times by the same horde. He is now camping your dead corpse and laughing at you.<br />
<br />
create a horde alt, each day log on and search for your new friend. If you notice he is out and about farming, make a note of this, log your main and bring some more friends. Pay him a visit. <br />

Once another person engage another person in the game its pvp.. Rest is more or less a question about Defenision.. Im saying that i dont think you got any chance whatsoever at level 20.. Where on the other hand you DO stand a chance at equal levels :) <br />

I know that and you know that, I was being sarcastic after seeing all the whiny threads about how pvp ruins pve. I play both sides of the game and I don't whine, I just adapt how I play. After all it is just a game. A lot of people seem to forget that.</div></div><hr />

I dont know exactly how much it will cost. But if you have to pay for each character like the Transfer thing , paying for ALL 10 Chars (bankchars included) only because you are on a pvp realm would SUCK BALLS.<br />

I play both sides of the game and I don't whine, I just adapt how I play. After all it is just a game. A lot of people seem to forget that.<br />
<br />
<br />
oh sry my fault XD<br />
<br />
I play both sides too of course it is just a game and I enjoy playing both sides.. .BUT on different servers<br />
I play both on pvp realms and I think its just weird playing both factions on one server... just because of the community you share the game with.. one day youre playing with someone the next youre ganking him? of course you dont have to do it and Im not gonna roll both sides on one realm just because we can now... I think it destroys the whole idea of having two different factions<br />
I loved the idea of people being able to attack the different facton at ANY time so i play on a pvp realm<br />
Im not someone who ganks people bt its good to have the option to attack the other faction when you want... of course you can still do that but whats the point now? could be your buddy... someone with whom together u just cleared a dungeon.<br />
<br />
Im not against the idea of playing both on the same server but you CAN do that on non-pvp realms... go there if you want to do that<br />
it just doesnt really go well with open world pvp imho</div></div><hr />

Ah, yes. Lagging in South Shore vs Tarren Mill battles, or how your raid wasted 1 hour of it's valuable time trying to fight it's way into Blackrock Mountain.<br />

I wasn't getting at you when I said it was just a game, lol. It's a reference to how every little change blizzard make is going to &quot;ruin the game&quot;.

Speak for your self. I found those 1 hour battles lot more fun, then grinding same scripted tank and spawn bosses over and over. Dont roll PvP servers if you dislike PvP, kinda pointless to roll one, and then say PvP which occurs there is bad.<br />

Everytime we had to move to BRM for either BWL or MC we had 40+ people sighing on Teamspeak because we knew we were going to lose valuable raiding time. And SS vs TM was about as 'epic' as Wintergrasp is. One big lagfest.<br />

<br />
Ah, yes. The good old 'PvP happens on a PvP server'-argument. Which is about as useful as complaining about getting ganked. Meaning it isn't.<br />
<br />
Where am I saying PvP on a PvP server is bad ? I'm referring to a time in WoW's history where you had no other choice but to get involved in these fuck fests of so-called 'PvP battles'. And these only interfered with so many people's time and agenda for certain hours of their day - to actually raid. You know, fight scripted bosses which is nowhere nearly as 'skillful' as watching players using their cooldowns/abilities on regular intervals ?<br />
<br />
Now the game has evolved. Blizzard learned of their mistake called Blackrock Mountain, made raid locations more accessible, more open and gave us various methods of getting players there fast, so they have no need to get stuck in unwanted PvP combat.</div></div><hr />

<br />
in fact it doesnt even end with players being able to roll both sides on pvp realms<br />
youll still get killed by high level players a lot so if you dont like it dont go there ^^ <br />
whoever has that big of a problem with it should play on a normal realm<br />
<br />
im playing pvp because i think its essential that we have the freedom to attack other players... without it it wouldnt be warcraft... just my opinion<br />
<br />
but the point is not even that... its the fact you can play both sides on the same realm... playing with your &quot;buddies&quot;... seeing one of them is leveling an alt... seeing where he is... switching to your alt and gank him<br />
<br />
I dont really like the fact that whoever wants to gank me is now able to see where I am all the time<br />
and the whole &quot;hmmm what side am I playing now&quot; &quot;glory for the horde or victory for the alliance?&quot;<br />

The choice of wanting to participate in a PvP battle or not is the real argument here. Like I mentioned before, there was a time in WoW where people where literally forced in these because there weren't methods to avoid them.<br />

<br />
<br />
If you feel the need to avoid PvP at certain hours of the day, maybe you should consider rolling PvE?<br />
<br />
<br />
The mindset here is that PvP doesn't come with such fancy things as 'freedom of choice'. It comes with the right to kill anything you can, whenever you can, for whatever your reasons. If this isn't for you, there are other servers to accommodate you.<br />
<br />
I'm from a PvP server, yet I hardly participate in outdoor PvP. Why am I on a PvP server then? Because the constant looming threat is enjoyable. Because the fragile peace that exists at a summonstone where two raids are meeting is so juicy you can taste it. <br />
<br />
<br />
With this change, they're distroying, nay, destroyed a very important part of PvP. Anonymity makes bastards of us all and we just lost a part of that anonymity. We're going to have to feel bad when we gank that level 30 who was foolishly standing on the road where I was riding along.</div></div><hr />

<br />
First things first : I for one like the change, especially if I'll be able to send BoA to my opposite faction &quot;alt&quot;. I wanted to make an opposing faction character to see the quests there as well. Can I do it on another server? Sure I can, but so far I've tried 3 times, and the servers just came out to be even worse than expected. <br />
<br />
WoW is dead arguments: give me a break. I still believe that you haven't seen how long exactly it'll take you to get even the ilvl245 tier, otherwise instead of QQing how easy epics are, you'll be QQ-ing &quot;Oh i have to farm 2 (and in 4 weeks 4) raid instances and do heroic daily every day for 5-6 weeks to get the badges necessary for my Tier, QQ I'll QUIT I TELL YOU&quot;. If you haven't checked, just do the math, it'll surprise you. Powerful gear? Because powerful gear from old content is what really matters, amirite? <br />
<br />
To those that are QQing that it's again made for money: Let's see which will net Blizzard more profits: faction switching 2-3+ alts (let's face it, the vast majority have around 2-3 characters on the same server and faction (if on PvP server until now), or faction-change + obligatory server transfer for people on PvP servers as you've suggested : first case - 2-3x 20 Euros/Dollars (just an example), second case - 20 + 20. If you can't do the math, the first one is higher, and will net them much higher revenues. And as some have already suggested - many people have 2 accounts just for this reason. With transfers of characters between linked WoW accounts in battle.net possible, a lot will close their 2nd account. And this brings them money again how exactly? <br />
<br />
This change simply means that they make it more convenient for the ones that actually want to faction-change in a PvP server, without forcing them to change every single character they have on the realm. <br />
<br />
WTS some common sense</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sephirote</div><div class="date">2009-08-05, 10:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah honestly that can just be good, I mean people will not have to be stick with two account in a PVP realm to have Horde toon and Alliance toon.<br />
<br />
and plz dont let me think that nobody know by now that already happen. So it change nothing in the game<br />
<br />
stop QQuing omg!</div></div><hr />
