Totems, Ammos, and Shards improvements<br />
We are always on the look out for classes or class mechanics that players seem to comment on a lot as not being particularly fun. [...] As just a few examples, totems, ammo and shards are all things we think we can improve in future patches and expansions. The changes we made in 3.1 to ammo and shards are just a small first step. There is always more that we want to do with this game. Always.

<br />
Class homogenization<br />
I understand the class homogenization concerns. It is sometimes difficult to make sure that all classes are viable for what they want to do without pushing their stats and abilities too close together. We are going to continue to try to strike a balance here. However I will offer that for every player that asks what was wrong with the good old days, there is a Prot paladin, Feral druid, Ret paladin, Arcane mage or Survival hunter who is happy that their spec isn't a joke any longer. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/16137184090-4-years-of-wow.html))<br />
<br />
Raids &amp; Dungeons<br />
800 pieces of gear in Ulduar!<br />
Streamlining the gear was a necessary step. Ulduar has something like 800 pieces of gear, and that is with all of the streamlining. (Sunwell had something like 160.) There is just no way we could offer extra loot for hard modes and unique sets for specs like Holy paladins and Ele shamans if we didn't homogenize elsewhere. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/16137223607-class-representation-mechanic-is-soulbreaking.html))<br />
<br />
Ulduar Legendary Mace only for healers? (The DK Part was obviously a joke.)<br />
I can't wait to see those DKs rocking the new healer mace. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/16137223607-class-representation-mechanic-is-soulbreaking.html))<br />
<br />
10-Man vs. 25-Man difficulty<br />
UBRS was a casual 10 man raid. Zul-Aman was not, especially the timed run. Karazhan may have been easier than Sunwell (but then again, it wasn’t that easy for many groups when it first shipped), but that whole system of progression was brutal on guild politics (5 player -&gt; 10 player -&gt; 25 player). I do agree that Naxx (and the rest of the tier) was often easier in 25 than in 10, and that was not our intent. Ulduar has tighter balance in that regard. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/16137184090-4-years-of-wow.html))<br />
<br />
Hard Modes<br />
You have a valid concern. However, we tried to come with an answer for that this time. If you want to see the content, go on normal mode. If you want a challenge, go on hard mode. If you complain that hard is too hard for you, then guess what… go back to normal mode. Previously the answer was basically “You aren’t worthy to face the end villain of this game you have invested hundreds of hours in,” which we thought was sort of a lame answer. Now you can see Arthas, but you aren’t going to get his best, most prestigious loot if you aren’t awesome. <br />
<br />
Introducing Hard Modes into 5-man dungeons<br />
We have discussed it. We need to see how many players really attempt the 10-player hard modes (and if those are really a different group of players than the ones also doing the 25-player hard modes). In some ways, it is harder to make very challenging content for smaller groups. Getting enough buffs in a small group is hard. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/16137184090-4-years-of-wow.html))<br />
<br />
Class quests ... and legendary HEALER mace<br />
Class quests are popular but they are expensive when you consider 90% of players (on average) aren't benefiting. Or put another way, every class quest we introduce is really 10 quests! Would it have been worth it to make the DK experience one tenth the size in order to offer a handful of quests to other classes? Would any of that content have been appealing or would it all feel a little watered down? I think the DK start area may be the best experience in WoW. Would it have been worth giving that up? (Clearly offering that kind of experience for every class would have been worth it, but if we could have done that, we would have.)<br />
<br />
Your stance seems to be that your class got screwed out of content because of the DK. But the DK was a big reason that a lot of players wanted to play WoW. They have been an enormously popular class, and from that point of view it's hard to argue we would have gotten so much interest in the expansion if that bullet on the back of the box had said &quot;More class quests&quot; instead. I'm not saying our only motivation is to sell boxes (though clearly in a business that has to be some part of the equation). I'm saying we tried to offer something in LK that players wanted, and in retrospect, the DK start area has been enormously popular.

Player versus Player<br />
Burst damage and healing in PvP in 3.1<br />
I just wanted to pipe in here since OP tends to point toward the highest bursty classes and mention that we want there to be a bit less burst than we are seeing now. We also know that healers tend to be pretty powerful and can overcome a lot of sustained dps, so we are trying to get somewhere in between. We want coordinated bursts to be effective instead of just 1 class doing it by themselves and we want to avoid healers completely dominating and giving us some good old 40+ minute battles of boredom. We will see how things turn out in 3.1. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/11/16137613985-the-new-op-classes-in-31.html))<br />
<br />
More Battlegrounds maps?<br />
<br />
This has come up in the past, but making the maps is not easy to do and does take a lot of time. Along with it, the queue system would need some major rework to be picking not just a Battleground but either picking or randomly selecting a map. And before you mention it, the last time we brought this up it wasn't an easy solution like &quot;copy the Arena queue&quot; - it is supposed to take a lot more work than that.<br />
<br />
All that aside, this is something we would like to do, but generally we have been focusing on brand new Battlegrounds and new formats - as we continue to expand on the formats though there is a possibility of new maps of the same formats coming into plate, nothing for sure at this time though. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/16137184173-battlegrounds.html))<br />
<br />
Professions<br />
Alchemy - Flask of Stoneblood in 3.1<br />
We felt the current amount of health from the stoneblood was just ridiculous at how low it was, especially considering the damage from bosses in Ulduar so we buffed it a bit. Just keep in mind that we don't really like the idea of every new flask/upgrade being something with the same stats and just higher numbers every time. As an example it's possible the next tanking flask would have the same or lower health but extra mitigation stats like armor or defense on it. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/16137183740-flask-of-stoneblood-buffed.html))<br />
<br />
Engineering - Reticulated Armor Webbing on Leather<br />
For those who don't follow patch notes, there's a new engineering enchant for gloves in 3.1. Adds 800 armor to gloves, usable only on plate. Presumably, it's to give tanks a perk while preventing engineering from being even more attractive to cloth pvpers. [...] Perhaps limit it to leather and above? It's appealing to cloth users, but a lot less so to leather pvpers that focus on burst instead of survivability. <br />
This is definitely a possibility for this engineering enchant. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/16137214217-how-can-we-use-800-armor-and-not-break-pvp.html))<br />

Arena Tournament<br />
Vanquisher Title<br />
Eligible characters that are level 71+ when the rewards are given out will receive the title. <br />
<br />
Invitational Tournament<br />
All characters that are a part of the top 1000 ranked teams will be invited to the Invitational Tournament during Phase 4. However, please keep in mind that standard Arena rules still apply here:<br />
1. The character must have at least 30% participation of the total games that the team played.<br />
2. The character's personal rating must be within 150 of the team's rating.<br />
3. The character played at least 20 games on the team. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/17/16137224366-question-about-invitation-ladder.html))<br />
<br />
Murkimus (Murloc Pet) eligbility<br />
Transferring your character should not impact your ability to receive the Murkimus pet, assuming that your account qualifies for the reward. However, transferring your character could impact qualification for end of Season rewards, such as end of Season titles and the Frostwyrm mount.

Frost as a Dual-Wield spec?<br />
We want both dual wielding and 2-handers to be viable for Death Knights, balancing both of these inside each tree has been exceptionally challenging and caused an issue or two. If we have to make it so DKs have one type of fighting, it will be the 2-handers. We are considering something like making the frost tree the dual-wield tree, so some frost specific abilities would hit with both weapons through that tree only, and then have unholy/blood as 2-hand focused. Nothing is set in stone though. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/15973487596-rip-dk-dual-wield.html))<br />

Feral DPS<br />
The main issue we are running into here is that the PvE dps, when pulled off properly, can be pretty high and that is what has caused some of the nerfs in 3.1. We recognize that maximizing PvE dps can require a fairly complex rotation which doesn't translate very well to PvP dps and we are considering some changes to improve that in the future.<br />
<br />
One example would be to make Rend and Tear include mangle in its damage bonuses or add a glyph of some kind that affects more PvP centric abilities. We are just trying to be very careful to not be so focused on one aspect of the game (PvE or PvP) that we over do it in the other one.

New Druid form models<br />
Druid forms are not coming in 3.1, but (big but) we are working on them. I have to say that when these do go live, it will have been worth the wait. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/15973727921-druid-form-graphics--whats-the-status.html))<br />
<br />
Feral tanking in 3.1<br />
Bears used to have the highest armor and highest health which is no longer the case (obviously), but we added the shield ability and improve their cooldowns to try and bring them more in-line with other classes. We are keeping an eye on them and will make improvements if they turn out to be a clearly inferior tank. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/16101820961-feral-tanking-concerns-in-31.html))<br />

Discipline Priest in 3.1<br />
1. We do want a lot of Power Word: Shields to be getting tossed out. You can use it on multiple people throughout the raid for additional regeneration if needed. We are still a little weary of where mana regeneration is at, we aren't sure it is really going to be hit that bad with the changes in patch 3.1.<br />
<br />
2. The talents requested are relatively far down in the holy tree with the goal of improving overall healing, the thing is that we don't feel discipline healing will really need these buffs as it could be fairly competitive as it stands. We feel the issue is the need to track the effective of shields, since these don't show up on healing meters it looks like the disc healing is low, but overall it should work out well if you add in the data from the shields.<br />
<br />
3. We agree that how grace works feels a little awkward, we are looking into this and may change it in the future, no guarantees though.<br />
<br />
4. We are still okay with how the weakened soul debuff works in a raid setting. If raids only allow 1 disc priest and it becomes a plaguing problem, we'll look into it, but at the same time we don't really want to see raids running around with only disc priests (this applies to any class).<br />
<br />
5. Like I mentioned above, we feel the overall effectiveness of disc should be pretty good in 3.1 if you consider not just the healing but the shielding aspect of it as well. We will see how it plays out. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/16019953827-disc-priest-outstanding-issues--concerns.html))<br />
<br />
Discipline Priest in Ulduar<br />
Will raids want Disc priests? We are honestly not too worried about that. We'd estimate about half of the healing priests we've watched in Ulduar are Disc, at least for the guilds that are making boss kills. Consider, that when you have a tank with 45,000 health and a boss is hitting for 25,000 health (which is not the kind of thing we did in Naxx, but is in Ulduar), none of the healing you can do will let that tank survive two hits in a row. But Power Word: Shield will. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/16137214426-disc-priests-give-it-a-rest.html))<br />

The reasons behind the addition of an AoE Ability in WotLK<br />
Because rogues complained, and rightly so, that they weren’t as attractive as other dps classes when there was a lot of AE involved, which was the case for all Naxx trash and even a few bosses. We decided that single-target vs. AE wasn’t a very strong niche for classes. There are situations where one or the other are useless. That doesn’t mean everyone needs to be equal, but standing around with almost no way to contribute isn’t a lot of fun (And doesn’t make raids want to bring you).

Giving an escape mechanism to Enhancement<br />
Just to touch on this, we are keeping an eye on the escape mechanisms category, we are just trying to be careful on things that will continue to push homogenization forward. We would like to be able to balance like shaman and priests without having to make an every 30 second get away type of thing, but we will see.

<br />
Unholy is much more a caster-hybrid tree with several spells not affected by weapon damage. Frost, on the other hand, is the tree most sensitive to weapon damage when it comes to it's iconic spells (Obliterate and Frost Strike) - Howling Blast is the odd egg in the basket.</div></div><hr />

Frost has Icy Touch and Howling Blast<br />
<br />
Unless I missed something, the amount of &quot;spells&quot; is the same. The only difference is the pets, but pets are rather a flavour of the tree, much like CC is with frost, and the same argument could be made with any other tree <br />
<br />
Icy Touch is going to be reduced quite harshly, it's mostly meant to be a disease adding ability. As for flavour, well, the perma-ghoul is the best damage increasing ability you can have as a DK and it sure isn't affected by weapon damage.<br />
If you want to argue flavour, you must look at abilities of dubious use such as Dancing Rune Weapon(1), Chillblains(2), Improved Unholy Presence, or Vendetta(3)<br />
1. This suffer from scaling problems, it's 50% of your NON-TALENTED, NON-BUFFED damage, and as such isn't pulling it's weight but is most often a DPS decrease when used.<br />
2. Purely PvP.<br />
3. Most trash and all solo content is easy enough for you not to benefit from this, and nearly all boss-bound trash (small adds in OS, fex) yield no XP and as such no HP.<br />
<br />
In fact, I'd argue that since dual wielding tend to make less use of FU and tend to use the runes individually together with the fact that dual wielding scales auto-attacks much better than two-handed, Improved Unholy Presence fit dual-wielding much better than Blood Presence, both conceptually and mechanically.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Blizzard honestly just doesn't want to admit how weak discipline priests are in PvE. There is a reason no one really wants them. Holy paladins still main tank heal better. In most cases you have 2 holy paladins or a holy paladin and holy priest on the tank on a heavy healing fight. Those two classes together can easily put out 25k worth of healing in about 2 seconds. Trying to say that no healing class will allow for a tank to take 25k back to back hits with 45k health is insane. All the healer has to do is get a 10k heal off before that next 25k hit happens. This comment from GC basically just said no amount of healing could keep tanks alive on patchwerk (who hit for 25k) or keep tanks alive on Instructor (if they had enough health and avoided his special a tank could tank instructor and stay capped). 25k seems like a lot but it just isn't. Power Word: Shield isn't as strong as Blizzard thinks it is and the talents in discipline to make it stronger don't it that much stronger than what the holy priest already has. <br />
<br />
Discipline in PvE is crap right now. 3.1 didn't go far enough to make them not be crap. No guild would take a second rate paladin (discipline priest) over the best aoe healer in the game (probably better than a shaman right now honestly) in a fight that is filled with aoe damage. Not to mention other problems with discipline still exist like the only tank that isn't screwed by those bubbles even after 3.1 is the dk and there never being a case that you should use pain suppression on the tank because dropping their aggro by even 5% is still a stupid idea.</div></div><hr />

They should really stop bragging about how much gear Ulduar has - most of it will be disenchanted because it sucks anyway. More drops only means less chance to get the items you actually want.

10 mans are enjoyed by countless people, especially on lower pop servers. Its a bit odd I know, but my guild downed 10 man 3d months before we did it on 25 man. I rock my of the Nightfall over my T.V. title w/o giving it a second thought.</div></div><hr />

I understand the class homogenization concerns. It is sometimes difficult to make sure that all classes are viable for what they want to do without pushing their stats and abilities too close together. We are going to continue to try to strike a balance here. However I will offer that for every player that asks what was wrong with the good old days, there is a Prot paladin, Feral druid, Ret paladin, Arcane mage or Survival hunter who is happy that their spec isn't a joke any longer.

800 pieces of gear in Ulduar!<br />
Streamlining the gear was a necessary step. Ulduar has something like 800 pieces of gear, and that is with all of the streamlining. (Sunwell had something like 160.) There is just no way we could offer extra loot for hard modes and unique sets for specs like Holy paladins and Ele shamans if we didn't homogenize elsewhere.

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
First off...<br />
<br />
The comments about homogenization are spot on, it is amazing that it took them this long to realize. What is the point of having multiple classes to fill a raid role, if they all can do the same thing in essence? I believe this has screwed Prot Warriors more than any class in the game. Druids have high armor, consistent threat, high health pools, moderate AE tanking, and respectable avoidance at high end gear. Death Knights have multiple life saving cooldowns, high avoidance, high health pools, and can easily fill a dps role by changing gear set. Paladins have great AE tanking, Higher health pools, High-Threat, and the same life saving cooldowns as a warrior. Warriors have no sort of specialization...no distinction...and frankly are not optimal for any situation.<br />
<br />
And as most of these class can respec to Heal, the warriors only raiding alternative is to dps. And as of 3.1, blizzard has decided to listen to the &quot;bitching&quot; of players who cant play their class properly and destroy the fury tree. I'm sorry, it makes no sense to every go fury now...we bring no raid utility...and not longer bring our competitive single target dps. Arms has been improved, but frankly isn't as consistent in a raiding environment as fury.<br />
<br />
The problem with the game, is that Blizzard has in fact forgotten about the &quot;good ole days&quot;. Warriors have always had high top end dmg, it was the pay off for working to get highly itemized gear. And this gear provided its own checks and balances by nerfing the warriors health and survivability. Comparing warriors to other &quot;hybrids&quot; is simply retarded. Warriors cannot heal, therefore they must earn 1 of the 3 tanking spots, which is just not happening at the current state of the game...or DPS...and provide a reason to bring a warrior instead of another Rogue or seemingly pure dps class. I say this b/c as fury specced, there is nothing else you can do ...but DPS. You cant decide to throw a quick heal (Elem/Enh Shaman, Druids, Shadow Priest, Ret pallys), you cant rez ( Ret Pallies, Elem/Enh Shaman, Shadow Priest, *Druids w/ Battle Rez), and you can't spot tank (Death Knights, Druids). Based on this, it only makes sense that Fury Dps to be slightly higher than these classes when played at optimization...which is the case on live curretly. People posting meters with them getting beat on bosses by warriors doing 4-5k, are just terrible players. Mages, Warlocks, Rogues * definately after 3.1, and Hunters can easily attain and beat these numbers if played correctly. And frankly no one gives a shit about trash. If that were the case, go bitch about how Rogues can spam FoK for over 12k dps,DKs can use a pestilence glitch and 1 shot Naxx Trash for over 18k dps, Shadow Priest and Hunters can use mindless aoe for over 9k dps, etc. <br />

Typical warrior QQ. You're twisting the issue, setting up a typical straw man argument.<br />
<br />
Plenty of people still use Prot warriors to MT, the entire POINT of making the other classes even ABLE to MT is so that bad players like you don't get to sit on your MT spot just because of your class. Sorry that you lost your MT spot to a better player who happened to be a Druid, but seriously, QQ more.<br />
<br />
Warriors have high health pools, high threat, good/decent AOE tanking, lots of ways to mitigate/avoid damage, and several life-saving cooldowns.<br />
<br />
Warriors can still DPS, sorry. Listening solely to patch notes and declaring the &quot;end of the world&quot; for a class/spec is always a retarded idea. DK's can only DPS if they aren't tanking too. It's not like this game requires more than 5 healers for anything any more, 1 in 5 mans and 2 in 10 mans. Most guilds have plenty of healers.<br />
<br />
&quot;Warriors have always had high top end dmg, it was the pay off for working to get highly itemized gear.&quot; And other classes don't work to get &quot;highly itemized gear?&quot; ROFLMAO. Get off your high horse.<br />
<br />
Then you're talking about they have to give a reason to bring a warrior over just a rogue? Warriors have more utility than Rogues by FAR. 5% crit, Battle Shout, the phys damage % buff, bleeds for Rogues (to use their new Hunger for Blood on), etc...<br />
<br />
And yes, fury warriors CAN &quot;emergency tank&quot; easily as well as a DK, Pally, or Druid. I have seen all of those classes get hit by the boss in DPS gear. EVERYONE gets shit on just as fast as you wearing a 2 hander and a shield, you're not special.<br />
<br />
How about you check out that 76 second sarth kill on the front page? They STACKED fury warriors to do it. 3 of them at the top above 5.5k dps. Warriors CAN dps. And I highly doubt you're doing anything other than looking at &quot;l33t WWSes&quot; of other players pushing 5k-6k DPS. So stop talking about shit you don't know about. Guilds are extremely different from group to group.<br />

<br />
Wow, where do I begin proving you wrong?<br />
<br />
First off,<br />
<br />
I never said that warriors were &quot;unable&quot; to tank any of the current content. I said that they are the &quot;worst&quot; of the tanking classes. You telling me that plenty of people still use a warrior to MT does not state any reasons why these such people might do so, as I have laid out a number of reason why you would not use a warrior to MT. <br />
<br />
&quot;Warriors have high health pools, and a number of ways to mitigate dmg&quot;, yea sure...high in what respect? Perhaps compared to a mage, but certainly not compared to any of the other tanking classes with equal gear. And with avoidance/mitigation. Death Knights have way more avoidance, Pallys have way more shield block, and Druids have way more armor....so GG.<br />
<br />
I never said warrior's cant dps. But frankly, the Fury tree is destroyed and we must now use an even more RnG spec to attempt to dps. And currently, warriors are the least DPS on bosses in the PTR. I am not just referring to the patch notes, which any person that understands basic math can take a 10% nerf to overall dmg....factor in rage loss...and come up with a good estimate at how this nerf destroys all utility of the Fury tree, but I have logged and tested these issues on the PTR...so GG again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Warriors bring way more utility than rogues&quot; Currently on the PTR, a good combat rogue will do 500 to 1k more dps single target than an Arms warrior...1k - 1.5k more than fury self buffed. Combat rogues provide the same raid physical dmg buff as arms warriors so...GG. Every raid has 2 paladins these days, so there is no need for Battle Shout b/c of Bless of Might...again GG. Feral Druids, who are better tanks and better DPS currently ont he PTR, provide the 5% static crit buff as well as the &quot;bleed dmg&quot; buff...GG. So you might bring 1 warrior to sunder, but oops...rogues can expose armor...so I guess 1 warrior to use shattering throw with BL.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fury warriors can emergency tank&quot;, frankly you are an idiot. Zerk stance = +10% base dmg. That makes crits hit you for around 220% the base dmg...that is a 1 shot. Fury warriors have almost 0 avoidance, and around 12-14k armor ....which wont matter much if you are crit. You have never seen a fury warrior tank a boss in dps gear...not even for a few seconds...GG.<br />
<br />
Yea, the 76 sec Sarth did have 4 fury warriors...the the class in first was a Death Knight...with 6.2k DPS. And a lot of the done in that encounter is spill over AOE, from WW... again GG. I'm not complaining, just saying...people who complain that Fury Warriors do too much dmg are bad players.<br />
<br />
The Volley doing 9k is a slight exaggeration. The point is...in clearing trash...there are hunters who top meters with 95% of their dmg being from volley...no reason to bitch about Fury Warriors current DPS. And why you chose to comment about hunters as opposed to the outlandish DK, S Priest, Warlock aoe capabilities...baffles me. <br />
<br />
I think in conclusion, please don't speak on a subject unless you know what you are talking about...and can support it.</div></div><hr />

Fine is almost synonymous with the word &quot;mediocre&quot; or &quot;satisfactory&quot;. Or in other words, a passing score of a C, where the other tanking classes might grade out a B or A. What you people don't understand is, when content actually becomes challenging...the margin for who can tank what, will become smaller and smaller. If you don't have actual stats/math to support your claims, don't waste your time posting. Go enjoy your free &quot;welfare&quot; epics from ggNaxx and feel like you're actually good at this game. Meanwhile, my point still stands...and Blizzard has already commented about the disparity between tanking classes. This is not new news folks, has been well documented. Just like if you know how to play your class, Locks and Mages should be topping meters...All this bitching about Fury Dps being too high is really retarded. Go youtube Fury dps vids from pre-TBC and TBC. Fury End game has always been comparable to &quot;pure&quot; dps.</div></div><hr />

<br />
what you babbling about?<br />
i am warrior for my own and let me say you one thing, warriors and warrior changes with 3.1 are good as they are<br />
the people that complain about the 10% phys.dmg nerf of TG only not able to play Furor well. Sure Blizzard could have done smarter nerfs, like putting 2h specc depper into arms, so furor cant skill it, but that doesnt matter.<br />
Furor still will be one of the most easiest way to be top on dps. The 20% strength instead of 10%ap is a change which gives a bonus of about 300-400 ap if you got 2h weapons and rings with strength enstead of ap, not talking about cloaks and other slots. <br />
You say Arms wouldnt be consistent enough? WTF? with 3.1 OP will be a fix 6s cd in armsspecc which makes it less dependent of proccs. Only procc left is Execute.<br />
The reason you say Arms isnt consistent might be its not as easy to play like furor, <br />
Arms has less free gcds and arms has more timers you must look at. But in my Opinion Arms is a equivalent specc to furor with 3.1, only Difference is less people are able to play Arms than Furor cause it needs at least a small amount of skill to make proper dps.<br />
<br />
About tanking, even i am not a prot warri, in my Opinion Warriors still one of the Best 1 Target tanks and even AoE tanking isnt that hard. No Tankclass is way to op compared to others.<br />
<br />
As others already said bout your post, the problem isnt that Warriors suck, the problem (at least from what you said it looks like it) is, you dont seem to be a skilled player at all.</div></div><hr />

Every class should have a counter class. Fury isn't ruining &quot;pvp&quot; (priest/warlock only huh?), warriors have always been Lock's nightmare.<br />
<br />
And that's why going toward massive pvp instead of &quot;1x1&quot; works wonders. Warrior's can beat your Lock, but you can walk together with your team and someone there can beat that warrior the same way.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Typical warrior QQ. You're twisting the issue, setting up a typical straw man argument.<br />
<br />
Plenty of people still use Prot warriors to MT, the entire POINT of making the other classes even ABLE to MT is so that bad players like you don't get to sit on your MT spot just because of your class. Sorry that you lost your MT spot to a better player who happened to be a Druid, but seriously, QQ more.<br />
<br />
Warriors have high health pools, high threat, good/decent AOE tanking, lots of ways to mitigate/avoid damage, and several life-saving cooldowns.<br />
<br />
Warriors can still DPS, sorry. Listening solely to patch notes and declaring the &quot;end of the world&quot; for a class/spec is always a retarded idea. DK's can only DPS if they aren't tanking too. It's not like this game requires more than 5 healers for anything any more, 1 in 5 mans and 2 in 10 mans. Most guilds have plenty of healers.<br />
<br />
&quot;Warriors have always had high top end dmg, it was the pay off for working to get highly itemized gear.&quot; And other classes don't work to get &quot;highly itemized gear?&quot; ROFLMAO. Get off your high horse.<br />
<br />
Then you're talking about they have to give a reason to bring a warrior over just a rogue? Warriors have more utility than Rogues by FAR. 5% crit, Battle Shout, the phys damage % buff, bleeds for Rogues (to use their new Hunger for Blood on), etc...<br />
<br />
And yes, fury warriors CAN &quot;emergency tank&quot; easily as well as a DK, Pally, or Druid. I have seen all of those classes get hit by the boss in DPS gear. EVERYONE gets shit on just as fast as you wearing a 2 hander and a shield, you're not special.<br />
<br />
How about you check out that 76 second sarth kill on the front page? They STACKED fury warriors to do it. 3 of them at the top above 5.5k dps. Warriors CAN dps. And I highly doubt you're doing anything other than looking at &quot;l33t WWSes&quot; of other players pushing 5k-6k DPS. So stop talking about shit you don't know about. Guilds are extremely different from group to group.<br />
<br />
LMAO @ Volley doing &quot;afk 9k dps.&quot; Except on skitter packs, Volley is less DPS than using multishot and explosive shot, which means we don't &quot;afk trash dps&quot; at all. You're complaining about 10% dps vs. other changes to balance it? How about a 30% damage nerf on Volley. Look it up. Lol @ complaining about FoK too.<br />
<br />
<br />
Druid/DK &gt; Warrior/Pally in Sarth 3D. That's the 1st example.<br />
<br />
&quot;DK's can only DPS&quot;. They can just change the gear. Do you really expect that a Prot warrior can just change to his &quot;fury gear&quot; and throw 4k, 5k, 6k dps normally? I believe a DK tank can do that by just switching to his DPS gear and presence, but warriors? LOL<br />
<br />
The same goes to the other way. From dps to &quot;emergency&quot; tank.<br />
<br />
Warrior's utilities... yes... hum... no, they'll be overwritten by the same, but longer, buffs from other classes (never heard of &quot;don't pick rampage for raid&quot;?). To bring the % physical dmg you actually put yourself in a very bad spot by going Arms and decreasing your DPS a lot.<br />
<br />
About the video, yeah, they did use Warriors, but you know that it's not a &quot;must have&quot;.<br />
<br />
It's the truth there, if a pure can't beat a warrior on the dps charts, then the problem isn't exactly the warrior...</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">stupid11</div><div class="date">2009-04-05, 06:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow, where do I begin proving you wrong?<br />
<br />
First off,<br />
<br />
I never said that warriors were &quot;unable&quot; to tank any of the current content. I said that they are the &quot;worst&quot; of the tanking classes. You telling me that plenty of people still use a warrior to MT does not state any reasons why these such people might do so, as I have laid out a number of reason why you would not use a warrior to MT. <br />
<br />
&quot;Warriors have high health pools, and a number of ways to mitigate dmg&quot;, yea sure...high in what respect? Perhaps compared to a mage, but certainly not compared to any of the other tanking classes with equal gear. And with avoidance/mitigation. Death Knights have way more avoidance, Pallys have way more shield block, and Druids have way more armor....so GG.<br />
<br />
I never said warrior's cant dps. But frankly, the Fury tree is destroyed and we must now use an even more RnG spec to attempt to dps. And currently, warriors are the least DPS on bosses in the PTR. I am not just referring to the patch notes, which any person that understands basic math can take a 10% nerf to overall dmg....factor in rage loss...and come up with a good estimate at how this nerf destroys all utility of the Fury tree, but I have logged and tested these issues on the PTR...so GG again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Warriors bring way more utility than rogues&quot; Currently on the PTR, a good combat rogue will do 500 to 1k more dps single target than an Arms warrior...1k - 1.5k more than fury self buffed. Combat rogues provide the same raid physical dmg buff as arms warriors so...GG. Every raid has 2 paladins these days, so there is no need for Battle Shout b/c of Bless of Might...again GG. Feral Druids, who are better tanks and better DPS currently ont he PTR, provide the 5% static crit buff as well as the &quot;bleed dmg&quot; buff...GG. So you might bring 1 warrior to sunder, but oops...rogues can expose armor...so I guess 1 warrior to use shattering throw with BL.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fury warriors can emergency tank&quot;, frankly you are an idiot. Zerk stance = +10% base dmg. That makes crits hit you for around 220% the base dmg...that is a 1 shot. Fury warriors have almost 0 avoidance, and around 12-14k armor ....which wont matter much if you are crit.

And why you chose to comment about hunters as opposed to the outlandish DK, S Priest, Warlock aoe capabilities...baffles me. <br />
<br />
I think in conclusion, please don't speak on a subject unless you know what you are talking about...and can support it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Warriors have more block than DKs, more HP than pallies, and more avoidance that druids....so GG.<br />
<br />
DPS =/= utility.<br />
<br />
Arms warriors provide the same raid physical dmg buff as combat rogues so...GG. (Who the fuck brings a combat rogue to a raid? Their DPS blows.) Every raid has a paladin and a DPS warrior, so no need for Blessing of Might. fury warriors provide the 5% static crit buff as well as the &quot;bleed dmg&quot; buff as feral druids...GG. So you might bring 1 rogue to expose armor, but oops...warriors can sunder...so I guess 1 rogue to distract the boss before pull.<br />
<br />
You seriously try to tank in Zerker stance with 2 handers out? Do you think feral druids emergency tank in Cat form? Throw on a shield and go defensive stance, moron. I've seen a fucking hunter tank Sapphiron for 30+ seconds, if you can't emergency tank in this game you fail. But we already knew that.<br />
<br />
Uh, wrong on the WW. Did you watch the video? They zerged Sarth down, didn't AOE ANYTHING. That was all single target damage. DKs do the same AOE as warriors with their diseases to boost their DPS, if the warriors HAD gotten boosts from WW, that means the 6.2k DK was boosted just the same, and there was a warrior at 5.9k DPS.<br />
<br />
&quot;there are hunters who top meters with 95% of their dmg being from volley&quot;<br />
<br />
O RLY. Do you even realize what you're saying? That's the exact same statement that you think is so wrong. There are fury warriors that top meters, there are shadow priests that top meters, there are mages that top meters, etc etc......<br />
<br />
Next time, think about your double digit IQ before you open your mouth.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Grats, one fight.<br />
<br />
No, they can't. Go play a DK and learn the difference between a tank-specced DK and a dps-specced DK.<br />
<br />
And a DPS DK can't even throw on a shield.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Newor</div><div class="date">2009-04-05, 07:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;Hard Modes<br />
You have a valid concern. However, we tried to come with an answer for that this time. If you want to see the content, go on normal mode. If you want a challenge, go on hard mode. If you complain that hard is too hard for you, then guess what… go back to normal mode. Previously the answer was basically “You aren’t worthy to face the end villain of this game you have invested hundreds of hours in,” which we thought was sort of a lame answer. Now you can see Arthas, but you aren’t going to get his best, most prestigious loot if you aren’t awesome.&quot;<br />
<br />
I'm really worried about that. I don't care about &quot;prestigious loot&quot;. Challenge/Good encounters &gt; &quot;purples&quot;.<br />
<br />
It's sad that the same way they dumb the game down so &quot;everyone can do it&quot;, they can't &quot;dumb enough&quot; so I don't depend on 24 others (or 9 others) to do the &quot;challenge&quot;.<br />
<br />
Unfortunatelly, most of the players prefer to just go and get their welfare stuff. They don't care about &quot;3 drakes&quot; because Sartharion alone is there, dead, the same way he would be dead with 3 drakes.<br />
<br />
It would be nice if Sarth + 3D was actually the default encounter and the hard mode would be something like &quot;beating sartharion while all 3 drakes are still alive&quot;, etc.<br />
<br />
This mentality of &quot;do the dumb stuff or do some &quot;crazy idea&quot; from a developer just to not be that dumb mode&quot; really sux. My reward is beating while it's challenging me, not something purple that the boss drops. I want a good raid/boss encounter (some ppl would refer it as &quot;epic fight&quot;) normally, instead of having to put 24 other ppl to do the &quot;hard mode&quot;, so we don't have to fight the &quot;DumbArthas&quot; as the hard mode could be something really stupid to justify the &quot;hard mode&quot; name.<br />
<br />
Don't know if I made myself clear here. I want the game to be a challenge again, but without having to force every player into hardcore madness and stuff like &quot;Yogg Saron + 3 Tentacles UP + no tank + healers with half mana + 2 second timer&quot; (so we can get the &quot;pocket Yogg pet&quot; drop lol).</div></div><hr />

<br />
And a DPS DK can't even throw on a shield.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sorry &quot;stupid&quot; (it's your nick). I have a lvl 80 DK as Blood Tank now (to be honest, before Blizz revamped blood as viable tanking spec), leveled and played for sometime at 80 as Blood dps, and I also have a Warrior (wich used to be Prot most of the TBC and Arms in the end, played a little as Arms in wotlk, changing to Fury after a few levels).<br />
<br />
So I can tell you the diference: DKs take way less damage than Fury Warriors. They don't need to throw on a shield. Why? They were made to be tank/dps, they use DPS weapons to tank and frost presence is their shield (in fact, way better than a shield). They don't have separated &quot;prot and dps tree&quot; like Warriors do. Every DK out there can solo most of the group quests in northrend even with DPS gear while Fury warriors can't. It's a fact.<br />
<br />
And no, it's not &quot;one fight, grats&quot;, it's one fight that actually put warriors/pallies out of the game without a question. There are a lot more fights where, as someone alread pointed out, they are just &quot;passable&quot; (or mediocre) and can do the job because the game is really easy today. When the dificulty level goes one point up, they will not be &quot;passable&quot; anymore. That's why Blizzard need to re-balance prot warrior with the other tank classes again and they're doing it.<br />
<br />
There is a reason why they nerfed a little druid/dk tanks and that's because things will start to get a little bit more &quot;sarth + drakes&quot; than &quot;naxxlolramas&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Lol please. &quot;I hope they remove dk's&quot; QQQQQQQQ come on Don't talk about something that will NEVER happen. OP or not the success of the class is what blizzard is more concerned with. Half of the people fighting dk's can't even expose the class weakness...even though atm there are very few ones xD, but it's not like say a shaman vs. a rogue (where even though the state of the shaman class is terrible atm) someone who's been playing long enough knows how to exploit a rogue and kill them. This situation is different for the dk class cause it's been around for almost 6 months....huge difference there. Sounds to me like a dk has destroyed you one too many times and now the QQ comes falling down.</div></div><hr />

They should really stop bragging about how much gear Ulduar has - most of it will be disenchanted because it sucks anyway. More drops only means less chance to get the items you actually want. The time you need to equip your toon will increase with this (which is probably their plan to make up for the lack of content).<br />
<br />
<br />
This is so true. I don't care for the second best in slot. I don't even want the second best in slot. I would much rather see the second best in slot disenchanted then worn by me. I know not everyone feels that way but why should I waste my dkp, my roll or my position in the loot wheel on an item I know I'm going to replace. <br />
<br />
I'd rather see them have 2 bosses dropping bis in Uludar then 2 bosses dropping second bis that become yet another crystal. I don't like raiding for crystals.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I doubt it because there will never be changes made to discipline priests that make them viable. No matter what they are still a second class holy paladin with out the ability to heal while trying to make up for it through fun utility that is either completely RNG reliant, stops the tanks from getting rage/mana or even worse lowers the threat of the tank. <br />
<br />
If I want a single target, strong, mana efficient healer that is capable of keeping the tank alive without much effort then I'll get a paladin. If I want the strongest aoe healer that can keep the group alive with hardly any effort and still come close on single target healing then I will get a priest. No change to discipline will ever fix that opinion, and I know very well I'm not the only member of the player base that feels exactly the same way.<br />
<br />
Discipline is a pvp spec. Discipline in TBC was a pvp spec. Discipline in 3.1 will be a PVP SPEC. If you want to pvp then by all means spec discipline. However, when it comes down to raiding trade in your ability to be a second rate paladin healer for the ability to excel at group healing.</div></div><hr />

Good for you; however, you are the exception to the rule. Did it make you feel good when that gear you got from 3d 10 man was replaced with gear from 25 man easy mode? I would assume it didn't.

If your paladin has more hit points than your warrior then one (or more than likely BOTH) of them is geared wrong.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
So you might bring 1 warrior to sunder, but oops...rogues can expose armor...so I guess 1 warrior to use shattering throw with BL.<br />
<br />
<br />
The top 2 armor debuffs stack. However, in 3.1 they will all be 5% and your boomkin (which unless they suck should be specced for improved faerie fire) and rogue will easily cover the armor debuffing even without a warrior tank (which almost everyone has one of).<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Fury warriors can emergency tank&quot;, frankly you are an idiot. Zerk stance = +10% base dmg. That makes crits hit you for around 220% the base dmg...that is a 1 shot. <br />
<br />
<br />
I was totally unaware you couldn't change stances in battle. I'm sure the majority of warriors are unaware of this from level 10. You really should teach them that although you can change stances in battle if you start out in berserker stance you end up tanking in it. BTW, other than a few cool downs (which last about as long as a rogues evasion) dks in dps gear have no more ability to tank than a warrior in fury gear. DKs that are specced for dps normally make horrible tanks in relevant content and DKs that are specced to tank still do less dps than any of the other dps. Hell, I've out dpsed a dk specced to tank and in tank gear on my protection paladin.<br />

S Priest<br />
<br />
<br />
Leave S Priests ALONE. Its bad enough that they are the red headed step child of the dps category, why do you feel the need to say that their aoe (one of the best things they have going for them especially if they aren't played 100% well) is overpowered.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Right now I would rank tanking as paladin&gt;death knight&gt;warrior&gt;druid with paladin and death knight just about tied for the top position and the paladin only leading a little bit because of utility. <br />
<br />
However, in 3.1 when they totally and utterly destroy both Death Knight and Druid tanks it will be Paladin&gt;Warrior. That should make you feel a little bit better.</div></div><hr />

<br />
DPS =/= utility.<br />
<br />
Arms warriors provide the same raid physical dmg buff as combat rogues so...GG. (Who the fuck brings a combat rogue to a raid? Their DPS blows.) Every raid has a paladin and a DPS warrior, so no need for Blessing of Might. fury warriors provide the 5% static crit buff as well as the &quot;bleed dmg&quot; buff as feral druids...GG. So you might bring 1 rogue to expose armor, but oops...warriors can sunder...so I guess 1 rogue to distract the boss before pull.<br />
<br />
You seriously try to tank in Zerker stance with 2 handers out? Do you think feral druids emergency tank in Cat form? Throw on a shield and go defensive stance, moron. I've seen a fucking hunter tank Sapphiron for 30+ seconds, if you can't emergency tank in this game you fail. But we already knew that.<br />
<br />
Uh, wrong on the WW. Did you watch the video? They zerged Sarth down, didn't AOE ANYTHING. That was all single target damage. DKs do the same AOE as warriors with their diseases to boost their DPS, if the warriors HAD gotten boosts from WW, that means the 6.2k DK was boosted just the same, and there was a warrior at 5.9k DPS.<br />
<br />
&quot;there are hunters who top meters with 95% of their dmg being from volley&quot;<br />
<br />
O RLY. Do you even realize what you're saying? That's the exact same statement that you think is so wrong. There are fury warriors that top meters, there are shadow priests that top meters, there are mages that top meters, etc etc......<br />
<br />
Next time, think about your double digit IQ before you open your mouth.<br />
<br />
<br />
Grats, one fight.<br />
<br />
No, they can't. Go play a DK and learn the difference between a tank-specced DK and a dps-specced DK.<br />
<br />
And a DPS DK can't even throw on a shield.<br />
<br />
<br />
Once again, you have proven that that smartest thing you have done in life...its picking the name stupid11.<br />
<br />
First off, let me define the word &quot;utility&quot; for you.<br />
Utility: the state or quality of being useful; usefulness ( Dictionary.com)<br />
So DPS does in fact equal utility. <br />
<br />
Next, You said who brings a combat rogue to a raid? My question to you is, &quot;Are you an idiot?&quot; Combat rogues do very good dps, and are very versatile. AND, after 3.1 can put out over 4k single target dps, self buffed. You obviously know nothing about what you are talking about.<br />
<br />
Your retort for my point about warrior buffs is just even more moronic. Why you would have a warrior try to keep up a shout..with a 3-5 min duration instead of a pally just buffing you with a 15 min buff , just being logic. As for the other warrior raid &quot;buffs&quot; that are easily overwritten. Not really much else I need to say on that matter, you made yourself look even more stupid.<br />
<br />
As for emergency tanking, throwing on a shield in DPS gear isn't going to go far. It would be the same as wearing Kevlar, in the middle of a nuclear explosion...so GG. Emergency suggest unexpected tanking, after combat has begun. To be honest, you are much better off getting a rogue to evasion tank, hunter to use detterence, Lock to go Demon form, pally use Bless of Protection ( any spec), DK do anything, Druid switch to Bear( which no longer requires going to caster for first) Spriest use dispersion...than ask a fury warrior to emergency tank a boss.<br />
<br />
As for the Saph video....you must be an idiot. IF you think a warrior did 5.9k dps without WW in his rotation...you know nothing about warriors ...therefore please leave the discussion. <br />
<br />
I didn't understand that last part, tbh. When did I say I had a problem with Mages, Fury Warriors, Hunters topping meters? I don't think, if all classes played optimally, in a &quot;patchwork setting&quot; hunters should top, simply b/c they are a ranged class with a lot of survivability. So it sort of defies the Survivability vs Damage scale effect. But, I do expect these classes/specs that Don't have much else to offer aside from there damage to at least have the potential * if played correctly* to do so.<br />
<br />
And lastly, to the guy with terrible spelling/typing skills. And I say that carefully, b/c I have always thought my typing was bad. But, in ref. to what you were trying to say about warriors in the 3.1 patch notes. From someone who has been on the PTR personally, don't get your hopes up buddy. The change to Zerker Stance is mediocre currently, and will probably have more of a pay off in the future with increased STR. That being said, it in no way makes up for the 10% dmg nerf. You do realize that nerf scales with your gear? The changes to Arms, are a def. improvement. But the DmG is still very RnG. And on low health mobs, will be very inconsistent. Not to mention, you will lose a lot of dmg vs moving targets, b/c you won't be able to get off as many Slams. So don't take you &quot;target dummy&quot; knowledge and suddenly think Arms is so great, that would be very short sighted. As I have said before, this patch has effectively killed the Fury tree...absolutely no reason to go fury Unless you wanna win on Trash Meters or enjoy seeing your toon hold two 2handers.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daez</div><div class="date">2009-04-05, 08:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">And no, it's not &quot;one fight, grats&quot;, it's one fight that actually put warriors/pallies out of the game without a question. There are a lot more fights where, as someone alread pointed out, they are just &quot;passable&quot; (or mediocre) and can do the job because the game is really easy today. When the dificulty level goes one point up, they will not be &quot;passable&quot; anymore. That's why Blizzard need to re-balance prot warrior with the other tank classes again and they're doing it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Blizzard has said COUNTLESS times that the way DKs tank today is OVERPOWERED and will not be the same in 3.1. DKs are getting nerfed out the arse in 3.1. When the dust is cleared it will be amazing if they can tank trash without heal sponging. <br />
<br />
Its funny that 2d put warrior tanks out of the game when the only tank we ever used on Sarth in 2d was a warrior and we have downed 2d. Our dk tank in that fight is on the adds. A warrior tanks sarth and a druid tanks the drakes. If your healers are good it makes up for your tank not being the all time best at the encounter. That being said, I have seen dks tank Sarth and take next to no damage, but then again dks are getting nerfed really nicely in 3.1.<br />
<br />
Your statements like warriors should tank in berserker stance, dks can solo all the group quests, and death knighs in tank gear can do decent dps are just disturbing. They basically state that you are completely clueless. Also, pick a side of the fence you really can't argue that warriors are horrible dps in 3.1 and are horrible tanks now in the same post without just saying warriors are pointless to begin with and warriors simply aren't pointless.</div></div><hr />

Actually, remember when they nerfed DK's from 40% reduction on BS to 20% reduction? Everyone cried then, too... Fact is for tanking, especially as Unholy, this is still the best mitigation talent across the board, even post-nerf, of ANY tanking class in the game right now... Period. So, as far as longer CD's and BB reducing damage (because less damage taken just sucks, sheesh whatever will we do!) it just looks like people will have to learn to play a DK tank again instead of just standing there and facerolling :) I've had the &quot;joy&quot; of healing some inadequate tanks and even some tanks - 7 or 8 come to mind - who are warriors and nowadays its hard to find even a good warrior so feel great that you have one that can/will successfully tank Sarth 2D+... To date, I feel Paladins still have the edge, even over some DK's... It's as with the Warlock and earlier Rogue nerfs... we all had to learn how to play again, and those locks (like mine that are now dormant) that could land a 10-11k shadow bolt pre-nerf before LK released are now finally, with the gear, getting back up to 4k DPS + ... same with rogues.... It's all just relearning the class mechanics no matter how you look @ it... .Choose to cry, Daez, or choose to use talent and skill and learn / spec into the new DK tanking spec, whatever that may be...</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have a macro for switching to Def.Stance and equipping my shield and sword (its snatched from arenajunkies.com; spellreflect). All it requires is a press of a button. Then ofcourse taunting and popping shieldwall. OT:ed in various situations, when the shit hits the fan. No problem.<br />
<br />
The nerf to fury doesnt bother me. Im a hybrid, I shouldnt top the meters. I have pretty decent gear (Valorous, BoH/Armageddon, FotFF etc etc) and I do 9k in DPS on Thadd. Tried &quot;Of The Nightfall&quot; a couple of times and me and the other warrior, on some tries, have done 6k in DPS (Got Sarth down too 2%). I only wear plate, some of the BiS is leather ive heard. <br />
<br />
With an Enhancment Shammy by my side the damageoutput is huge. Sure, i dont do as good on trash as Mages, Warlocks, Hunters and Druids but hey, 5k+ DPS on every single bossencounter in Naxx?<br />
<br />
We deserve a nerf. Rogues, Mages, Warlocks, Hunters should top the charts. Thats the truth. <br />
<br />
Our guild has some really good players and I consider myself being one of them. Although im lightyears behind a lot of ppl. <br />
<br />
With that in mind, the FuryDPS is pretty brainless, it doesnt really require any skill (Ferals have alot harder). Sure sometimes ure ragestarved and sometimes Slam doesnt procc. But hey, does it matter really? On Thaddius, with Hysteria... Warriors are unstoppable.<br />
<br />
Just my 2 cents</div></div><hr />

I know druids that are turning 4-7K depending on the boss. And they are Not. Healing, oomkin, or Tanking. Perhaps it's just.<br />
