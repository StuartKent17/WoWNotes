Champions’ Carnival Coverage<br />
On November 21, the 2009 Champions’ Carnival was held in Taipei; a complete overview of the event is now available. World of Warcraft Game Director Tom Chilton was on site to field a special Q&amp;A session directly with the players in attendance. Shortly before the event, we conducted an interview with Little Grey, the first player in the world to complete every achievement in the game. We also have the full details of the Arena tournament that took place during the festival.<br />

Blue posts<br />
PvP Gearing in Cataclysm<br />
The PvP gearing system is actually pretty similar to the PvE gearing system. If you're awesome, you have access to the best gear. If you're not as awesome, *or* if you're new, then you don't have access to that gear, but you have access to the gear just a tier behind. Next season you'll have access to the new gear, but the better players will have access to even better gear, and so on.<br />
<br />
Yes, you're going to have more of a challenge competing against players with the best gear, but it's not an insurmountable advantage and the system won't completely starve you of the ability to get the best gear even if you lose a lot.<br />
<br />
Rated BGs are not designed to give players who just want to lose their way through a bunch of battlegrounds Gladiator-level loot. They're designed for players who don't like the small, short, duel-ish feeling of Arena but still like coordinated, competitive play. (I also expect there will be a lot of overlap between the two.) If rated BGs aren't for you or you just can't compete for some reason, you still have access to the previous season's gear (and you can even get it through PvE progression).

<br />
Casters weapon enchants<br />
We recognize that weapon enchants (and even weapons in general) aren't as exciting for casters and healers specifically as they are for melee. Procs are certainly one way to address that problem, and it's something we're taking a hard look at. As several players have pointed out though, they aren't trivial to design. Proc'ing damage is generally useful for a damage-dealer. Proc'ing a heal is unreliable at best and often just wasted. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/21730645136-procbased-weapon-enchants-for-healing-.html))<br />
<br />
Patch 3.3.0 Known Issues - Update<br />
Gunship Encounter – Some players may be ineligible to receive loot when this encounter is complete. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/21726252825-patch-330-known-issues.html))<br />
<br />
Change of mind on Battered Hilt droprate<br />
Sometimes we change our minds as data is collected. Data in this case came both from player feedback as well as our statistical review of how many Battered Hilts were infiltrating realms. As community managers, we do our best to relay the best information we can based on our discussions with our development staff and our own observations.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, in a game as complex as World of Warcraft -- and with official responses forever plastered on the internet -- there are times where you might catch us providing conflicting information. This doesn't mean we're lying or misinformed. It simply means that things change as we continue working to make this the best game possible. When things change the information we share changes.<br />
<br />
You'll note in my original post you've quoted I mentioned that the change was based on strong player feedback claiming the drop rate was too low, and after further observation we agreed. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/22049925074-battered-hilt-what.html))<br />

Sweeping Strikes / Bladestorm<br />
We are in fact keeping the interaction. SS will still be worth hitting when Bladestorm is up. What it will not do is hit one target 4 (or in some cases even more) times. The stand alone ability Whirlwind had this bullet-proofing as part of the spell, but the new whirlwinds created as part of Bladestorm did not. We think this is one of the main causes of the &quot;Bladestorm blowed me up&quot; feedback.

Will there be flying mounts that could take passengers in the future?<br />
<br />
This is something we are planning on adding at some point in the future. <br />
<br />
Will it be possible to add an &quot;instance spectator&quot; mode to the game?<br />
<br />
This is a feature that we would like to add for both raids and Arenas in the future. <br />
<br />
Some players like to collect many sets of items, but the current bank slots are just not enough. Are there plans to add a wardrobe feature to the bank, to help players store their item sets?<br />
<br />
This is something that we're currently looking into and would like to implement at some point in the future.<br />

These caught my attention even though they're bit &quot;we'd like to give you this pony and this pony&quot; again and can't be expected very soon atleast. Some of the other parts were remotely interesting too, but it's mainly the same old.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I feel this is a bit stupid really. PvE doesn't reward &quot;awesomeness&quot; it rewards putting an extensive amount of your time into playing to gear up and learn encounters. There is very little that being a good player will do to help you in a raid over the thousands of others with their elitist jerks rotations, specs and BiS lists. Unless you truly are one of the proper theorycrafters that give all the sheep their ideas. Even then though, it's not like you're ever reacting to something different, just going through the motions. <br />
<br />
PvP is the true test of awesomeness surely? Seeing somebody in the top tier of arena gear is always a sight to me, because I know I'll never have that gear in that patch because it would take me a shit load of practising pvp to get anywhere near their level, but seeing somebody in the latest tier gear I just think to myself &quot;meh I'll be there in a few months when my /played for this patch catches up with yours&quot;.<br />
<br />
I mostly raid not pvp and I've always been able to keep fairly up to date on boss kills in wow when I'm actively playing, but I've never got anywhere in the arena despite the fact I used to play fps games semi professionally in my teenage years (I went to some cpl events etc and won money), so twitch gaming isn't anything new to me. For the record the reason I do PvE is because I'm quite a social person and enjoy playing with others. I think being a big guild group and doing raids is much more fun.</div></div><hr />

So, just need /played to receive the heroic raid gear? Interesting. Ok...<br />
<br />
Still amuses me that ppl think pvp is the ultimate &quot;surprise&quot; instead of a world of fixed comps in lolrenas, class X eat class Y in duels, and action A to always counter action B... instead of seeing the same name and AI, you just happen to see a diferent player name and better or worse AI.<br />
<br />
You'll be able to get all that exactly top arena gear faster, piece by piece, that you could ever get the equivalent gear setup in heroic 25man gear... seriously... and you'll really just need /played on the next patch.</div></div><hr />

Sorry to disappoint, It is 100% the Dark Ranger. Say all you want, flame me, but I know the truth :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
None of those swords is desirable to any Arms warrior who knows how to spec. Every top-tier arms warrior I know uses a polearm or axe because the weapon specialization is much more useful than the sword specialization. I just checked the 14 people above me on my server for Alliance side (I'm 15th), in addition to friends I have in game who aren't as well-geared. Not ONE has anything but an axe or a polearm. The fact that they're choosing level 219-245 level items over the 251 sword makes me think they probably aren't worth using. I suppose you could argue they haven't had the opportunity to get them, but losing 5% crit chance to a chance at an extra attack every 45 seconds or so using sword spec *really* isn't likely worth the upgraded stats the sword might have. That's 5% less crit you have to worry about gearing/gemming.<br />
<br />
I've had my GM offer me a Battered Hilt twice now. I passed, and one went to a hunter in the guild. He found his DPS was higher with his previous weapon combination. The other one sold for 20kg to someone who obviously had too much gold on their hands.</div></div><hr />

My hope for that went out when they started handing out shaman buffs to other classes. I miss the feel of a buffing class!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Still amuses me that ppl think pvp is the ultimate &quot;surprise&quot; instead of a world of fixed comps in lolrenas, class X eat class Y in duels, and action A to always counter action B... instead of seeing the same name and AI, you just happen to see a diferent player name and better or worse AI.<br />
<br />
You'll be able to get all that exactly top arena gear faster, piece by piece, that you could ever get the equivalent gear setup in heroic 25man gear... seriously... and you'll really just need /played on the next patch.<br />
<br />
<br />
ROFL if you think hard modes are hard at all, on an individual level, in any encounter in this game.<br />
<br />
Come back when you break 1300 and tell me that certain comps &quot;always&quot; beat others, or that you &quot;always&quot; use X action when certain things happen to you.<br />
<br />
That's the most retarded thing I've ever heard, tbh.<br />
<br />
Get Gladiator and tell me it's easier than all these stupid proto-drakes from easy mode PVE.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Morgomir</div><div class="date">2009-12-20, 07:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">well I do remember that CC was half the battle in BC raid content at least for progression and it marked the difference between good and bad players<br />
I speak of course of trash and some encounters<br />
TK: The Eye trash being harder than most of the bosses in WotLK and quite a few of the bosses in BC</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nymrohd</div><div class="date">2009-12-20, 09:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hehe, the Eye trash, way more complicated than most WotLK bosses.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mackeyser</div><div class="date">2009-12-20, 11:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Harder? I dunno. I think they just required a bit more patience and concentration... If you use ToC tactics and current 3.3 5man heroic mentality of &quot;round 'em up and AoE'em down&quot;, then...ya.. MUCH harder...<br />
<br />
I think they're doing the players a disservice in reducing the need for players to use more of their skill palettes. Rather than spam a few buttons and see BIG numbers (isn't that why they added Lava Burst for Shaman? to remove the lightning bolt machine gun with Lightning Overload and the Lightning Capacitor procing like mad?).<br />
<br />
Seems to me that the skill players aren't so much &quot;harkening back to the halcyon days of yore when all was well, the game was perfect, noobs were easy to spot, ninjas, baddies and dbags were marked with green hunter's marks over there heads so all could see and ridicule them while keeping them away from their loots and their raids... etc&quot;, but rather that encounters required the use of more than hyper-specified roles. Well, BC did. I think vanilla was probably worse than LK in that regard. BC seemed to have some really nice encounters which required teamwork. <br />
<br />
Anyhoo, today it's straight tank, dps, heals. Unless a heal or dps is to ONLY dispel or interrupt... Seems the organic nature of being well-rounded and complete, skilled with a full knowledge of one's class doesn't really mean much these days especially when it comes to dps. Skilled tanks/heals always seem to be able to distinguish themselves (cuz there's always something silly a dps is doing...). <br />
<br />
I mean, I recently rerolled a rogue from Ele shaman after the Ele debacle... practiced sapping and various other roguey skills I'd known other rogues to use from vanilla and BC. I mentioned this to LK rogues now and to a person, every last one asked me... WHY???<br />
<br />
And that is where the design failure occurs. I dunno if that can be changed before Cata due to the need to change stats, boss dmg, heals, dps, etc. A LOT has to change...<br />
<br />
Still... I dunno that it's so much wanting a more complicated rotation cuz being mut and sweating keeping rupture up isn't much fun... but knowing I have all these tools in my bag that I never get to use... that rogues used to HAVE to use... (and that's similar to other classes as well) well... seems the experience has narrowed, diminished, become overly specialized. Not that I want rogues to heal or anything, hehehe, but simply having variations on the tank &amp; spank theme seems to have really narrowed the experience of each role.</div></div><hr />
