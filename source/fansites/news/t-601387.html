<br />
I hope so, its just i've seen screens (it was on worldofraids.com i think) with crazy prices like 2,700+ Points for an armor part.<br />
<br />
Well i was just wondering about it because wof.com is a pretty serious page i thought.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dave021</div><div class="date">2007-06-14, 11:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">One thing that &quot;caught my attention&quot; was this. <br />
<br />
1. I guess you all noticed the insane armor/armour stats on the cloth gear (Me as a Rogue can only say, what?)<br />
2. Anyways, the &quot;interesting&quot; part comes when looking at the armor stats of the &quot;veteran's armor&quot;, as it doesnt look like these stats are as good as on the arena parts for cloth users. <br />
<br />
Are one of these showing the wrong stats for the cloth users?<br />
<br />

http://www.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2007/june/newhonor_cloth.jpg<br />
<br />
And also: The &quot;cost&quot; of for example &quot;Merciless Gladiator's Greatsword&quot; is 4313 ArenaPoints and the &quot;Shiv&quot; costs 1294 ArenaPoints and the &quot;Shanker&quot; costs 3019 ArenaPoints according to the picture here &gt;&gt; http://www.worldofraids.com/img/boards/arena/arenaweapons.gif<br />
<br />
Ps. Thanks for the Updates!<br />
<br />
Edit2: According to these pictures the weapons have the same cost as in AS1 &gt;&gt; http://img31.picoodle.com/img/img31/8/6/14/f_Page1S2Weapm_924f489.jpg<br />

<br />
2 smalls questions, if anyone checked on the ptr:<br />
<br />
1 - Prices of season 2 armors are exactly the same as current season 1 ? (i mean, for sure ? or a bit higher ? if anyone got screen)<br />
<br />
2- did someone checked on ptr if new war mounts were finally implemented ? (elekk and cockatrix)<br />
<br />
thanks !</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Boubouille</div><div class="date">2007-06-15, 08:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Gonna check in game for both infos right now, and will post screenshots</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Plume</div><div class="date">2007-06-15, 08:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I found this on official french pvp forum (warlock items screens)<br />
http://img477.imageshack.us/img477/6463/setsaison2gi4.jpg<br />
<br />
if u check behind the item box, you manage to see armors cost<br />
<br />
Shoulder: 1500<br />
Robe: 1875<br />
Helm: 1875<br />
pants: 1875<br />
gloves: 1125<br />
<br />
So it seems that the prices of S2 are the same as S1 armors items (during S1)<br />
<br />
waiting for confirmation :)</div></div><hr />

Anyway, just went in game, no new mounts, and the prices seems to be the same as the one you posted, will have a screenshot up with them to make sure that people stop asking :p</div></div><hr />

Where did these pics with the higher costs come from? Where have they gone?<br />
<br />
On the European Servers we seem to have the same prices for arenagear 2 as we currently have for gear 1 (I personally don't have a ptr client) what about you Americans?</div></div><hr />

I have proof in my screenshots that show the most expensive items (ie 2h, crossbow) are now 4313 instead of 3750.<br />
<br />
What is crazy is that the merchant shows 3750 prices for the Merciless stuff for my friend.<br />
<br />
What is the difference between us? I am a warrior and he is a druid. I think that either it is a bug or intentional that the prices are going up. <br />

Exactly, they are either raising it by 15% or keeping it the same as season 1 is now. There has never been a blue post saying what the plan for season 2 item pricing will be, even though people claim that for some reason.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Are the belt, bracers and boots from season1 still buyable?</div></div><hr />

<br />
It won't be required that you have the current season's set or piece to upgrade to the next season's set or piece. The season 2 items will take over the same point cost (or close to it) as the current season's, and the current season item point cost will lower. The current plan is to keep only the current and previous season's items available. Meaning that when moving to season 3, the season 1 items will no longer be available. This is of course subject to change. <br />
<br />
There will be some amount of planning and forethought into when you buy an item as a new season approaches. If you want to wait until the next season comes around because those items will be better then feel free. It's not going to be a lucrative strategy though to wait a large amount of time just because they're better. You're not going to spend half the season capped because you know the next season's items are going to be better, right? Couple that with the fact that a new season doesn't guarantee that new items will be added, and you're taking a big gamble by not buying something unless you're really sure those new items are there and waiting for you on a specific date.<br />

Rogue leather<br />
-----------<br />
chest: 428 armor <br />
head: 348 armor<br />
legs: 375 armor<br />
shoulder: 321 armor<br />
hands: 268 armor<br />

Am I missing some basic mechanics here? Isn't leather supposed to have higher armor then 'equal' cloth?!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Basically, it means that some of the stats points were used to increase the armor instead. It's a new value included in the 2.1.0 patch, the official description of the stats for the itemcache.wdb is this one :<br />
<br />
<br />
Shows the added armor (item class 4) or weapon damage (item class 2) for which item points are spend. Can also be negative as seen for caster weapons (damage subtracted, to gain points to spend on caster stats).</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. Blizz posts repeatedly confirm this<br />
2. They are reducing the Season 1 gear allready with factor 0.87, why raise the other one?<br />
3. The US PTR is thought to be looked after better than the EU one in general, if one screws up it's probably the EU one<br />
4. The higher costs of items on the EU PTR matches exactly the 0.87 factor which is applied to the season 1 gear, making a screw up by the PTR GM's very likely (for example 4313 for 2handers instead of 3750 right now)<br />
<br />
Hope this helps settling the disturbance around the item costs</div></div><hr />

Ok, sorry to derail a bit but green stats mean what exactly then? Opposed to white?<br />
White is what grear normaly should have and green is increased? At what cost? what stats go down? White ones? They stay white? Sorry, never knew the meaning of this green color and hopign to finaly understand it since you seem to understand it.</div></div><hr />

Dont worry it will not take very long. But doing this fixed the problem for me. This is why people are seeing diffent prices and such. I tryed deleting WTF and WDB files and it did not do it for me. If you know a good way to get rid of cache files then do that. <br />
<br />
The new items are the same price as the current items and current items are 10-15% less. Same goes for honor items, new items are the price of current. Honestly I didnt see the current items moved to a diffrent vendor for less (boots/belt/bracers), but I am assuming they will be less then what they are on live atm.</div></div><hr />

Hi, I wanted to know why some parts of the warlock's set2 are better than mage's set2 ?<br />
For example if we compare the hands, we can notice that their stats are the same for the Set 1, but not with the new one. And it's nearly the same with the shoulders and the chest.<br />
<br />
There's no problems with the head and the legs. Am I the only one who notice that ?<br />
<br />
Thanks for all and sorry about my enligsh, I'm french !</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also, why on earth do mages get so much armor suddenly? My main's a mage, but I'd rather have stats than that insane armor (more than rogues on those 5 pieces). It's just not right. Ok, we can get a bit more armor, but more than leather? I just don't understand that part..</div></div><hr />
