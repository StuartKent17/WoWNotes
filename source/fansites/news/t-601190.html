We've finally got an official post for professions change.<br />
<br />
Due to popular demand, we are revealing all of the current notes for professions in the upcoming content patch. Please remember, all notes may be subject to change.<br />
<br />
Alchemy<br />
The chance of a discovery occurring while making potions has been substantially increased.<br />
Elixirs now stack in two categories, Battle (Offensive) and Guardian (Defensive) Elixirs. You can only have one of each type of Elixir up at a time. As a result Elixirs now stack with class abilities such as &quot;Arcane Intellect.&quot;<br />
Elixirs now stack to 20.<br />
Four new defensive elixirs have been added. Two are on trainers, one is in Halaa and one is in Cenarion Expedition.<br />
&quot;Flask of Petrification&quot; can no longer be turned off during its duration, but it now will clear all threat from all monsters for the duration of the effect. Though monsters may reacquire you after the effect ends.<br />
Cooldown time on &quot;Earthstorm&quot; and &quot;Skyfire Diamond&quot; transmutes has been reduced to 1 day.<br />
&quot;Invulnerability&quot; potions now stop the first 120 damage per hit for 8 seconds, rather than making the imbiber physically immune.<br />

A new set of more powerful gems can be found by raiding Hyjal and Black Temple. Their stats exceed those of previous gems that could be found.<br />
A number new gem cuts to existing gems have been added to the game. Included among them are a spell hit gem and more multi-stat gems that have attack power on them.<br />
