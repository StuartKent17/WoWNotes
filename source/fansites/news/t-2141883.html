Ghostcrawler Tweets<br />
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br />
Do you have to main X to develop X?<br />
I addressed a question earlier today about whether designers should “main” the characters, classes or champions (depending on the game) that they work on.<br />
<br />
This topic got a lot of traction, at least on my Twitter feed, so I thought I’d explore it a little more.<br />
<br />
I phrased it as a question back to players: do you want designers to be objective or subjective about character design? <br />
<br />
Someone commented that they wanted the designer to be objective about data (say win rates) but subjective about class design.<br />
<br />
I had always assumed objectivity is the right way to go. This doesn’t mean a designer has to be clinical or cold-hearted or unempathetic. But it does mean they should view things from an impartial lens. I sometimes get suspicious when a designer is too close to her design. There is a risk she may want players to like her design at all costs. (For example, if her champion in LoL is hard to counter, that may increase play rates and even player affinity for that champion.) Maybe she gives her character special perks or content that others don’t get. Maybe she just sets expectations with players that she’s personally looking out for their character, so they feel that much safer.<br />
<br />
Is this a good thing?<br />
<br />
I feel like the player experience when discussing their character, at least on social media and forums, is often adversarial to other players. You might feel like your character got the raw end of the deal, but they feel their character got the raw end of the deal. I wonder if that’s why there’s such a strong sentiment about having a developer in their corner who players their character.<br />
<br />
But as a developer, ideally the way we view characters, classes or champions is not adversarial. They are all our children, and we want to see them all succeed. I played a warrior and priest the most in WoW. I worked on death knights a lot, but never spent that much time playing them. Hell, if anything I felt like I should spend my time playing on a different class so I would learn a class that I didn’t know as well.<br />
<br />
I feel like what a lot of players are saying when they want a developer who mains their character is they want someone who understands their problems, because the dev has experienced them first hand. That makes some sense. But if all design problems were so intuitive to designers, then we wouldn’t need player feedback, because we wouldn’t make mistakes in the first place.<br />
<br />
I think as a dev you definitely need to understand the problems, or you may underestimate (or overestimate) the severity or maybe even try to fix the wrong problem. I’ve seen this happen before - hell, I’ve done this before. You need to understand your game at a pretty detailed level to be effective at working on it, and yes this can be a challenge when working on very large games. I’m still not sure that means that somebody on the development team needs to main the character they are working on.<br />
<br />
(As an aside, I’m strictly talking about the design work itself that goes into character creation, not whether or not the designer in question is active on forums, Reddit or other social media specifically addressing your concerns or answering your questions. That may be a problem, but I think it’s orthogonal to this one.) (Source (http://askghostcrawler.tumblr.com/post/154401069923/do-you-have-to-main-x-to-develop-x-i-addressed-a))<br />

Apparently you do, since you're aggravated by it. Why do you care so much about stuff you claim to not care about at all?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Absolutely not the only one, but I do read them, and I read many of them. He has a lot of interesting things to say that some need to hear. Right now its players vs. Dev&amp;designers on wow forums, even here. Not saying I am pleased with wow's current state, but there is too much unnecessary focus on how the their dev is not playing their class, or that he is keyboard clicker and tried out wow on a tab. <br />
<br />
So now players feels helpless when this blizz teams screws the one thing over the other with much information on one class, and completely ignores the other. So in that case Ghostcrawler can shed some light on how things are on the inside.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lightbull</div><div class="date">2016-12-28, 10:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've noticed that a lot of WoW players, at least the ones that post on the forums, don't look at things from the developer's perspective, or just don't care.

<br />
Of course, sometimes they are right. But most of the time, when the developers don't change something or give an explanation why they don't believe a certain change will work, it means that the problem lies deeper than just changing it because the players want it that way.</div></div><hr />

Not really aggravated dunno how you got that vibe, Its just whenever I see it i skip over it. I don't see how a game designer that left the WoW team a long time ago talking about the same game, is still relevant, so relevant in fact its on the home page.</div></div><hr />

If you're relying on legendaries to make you viable, you're just a bad player. And any guild that needs every player to have the best legendaries to progress is a bad guild.</div></div><hr />

Go play UH DK and say that you not need the legendary bracers. This example right here is the reason this leg system failed big time. I feel bad for any UH DK who are still looking for theirs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So frustrating and sad that optimal dps and rotations are based around RNG of the correct legendary's... Still raid at a high level (US 150, 2/3M ToV) but won't reach full potential until I can manage to get 2 real dps ones to drop.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I see it differently - I think he over-thinks the role too much, and is so leery of &quot;bad things&quot; happening, that in his view, devs pull too far back. His example is poor - if a designer gives her character bonuses that are over-powered, it's the lead dev and game's director's job to say no to that, and to fix it. <br />
<br />
The original question is, should a designer play the class he's designing?<br />
<br />
Well, let's re-frame it: GC got his start making custom maps for Age of Empires. Should a map designer for that game actually play that game, and be good at certain scenarios? Or should they be &quot;objective&quot;, like he says, and design from a generic credo and general depth of knowledge, but no real passion, interest or experience, and doesn't play custom maps.<br />
<br />
Which map would you play? <br />
<br />
The overall message I get from GC is he/they are afraid to change the design process, because the current one kind of sort of works, and he doesn't really understand the design process enough to make changes that won't blow everything up. All I hear from GC and Ion is &quot;We're figuring it out&quot; - you'd think with the massive amount of experience they have designing games - and damned good ones, in the past, that they'd have an idea how it works. <br />
<br />
That's not a good place for a creative professional to be in - and would explain a LOT about the Blizzard design process. <br />

It's pretty obvious that I would play the map that had more passion pumped into it. But that wasn't my point, though I said it pretty vaguely.<br />
<br />
I'm gonna use a class example from a post I made a couple days ago, factoring in what GC said about people not always being 100% committed to the class they're assigned to. Maybe the person working on Mage decided to reroll Rogue. Maybe the Warlock designer only plays Destruction. Maybe the Hunter designer doesn't currently play WoW.<br />
<br />
But what would Blizzard do in this situation? Do they use up resources trying to find someone else who can replace these people because they're not doing their job perfectly? At what point should Blizzard fire these people? I believe that thinking subjectively on class design would be great, but realistically the designers can't always deliver on this, and Blizzard shouldn't have to cycle through designers every month or so.</div></div><hr />

How many legendary items have you received that are beneficial to your role?(i.e. DPS role, received X legendary items with a DPS gain)<br />

Agree , that would give intresting insight on what drops for what spec .<br />
Me personal had 2 drops on my main (dps) that contribute ZERO to my dps .<br />
So no epic feel for me when they dropped only dissapointment .</div></div><hr />

But if the Mage designers (they don't have a single designer per class) hadn't played Mage in a while or ever, they will miss things about how the class plays. It's not always about numbers, it's also about feel. My Hunter main got shelved because I liked the feel of SV which went melee and didn't like the feel of MM... plus MM lost traps and pets. Now, sure, it put up great numbers.... but it wasn't FUN. Meanwhile my shadow priest was kind of fun... but the output sucked at 100 since the spec is now balanced around StM at 110. <br />
<br />
It's VERY hard to get feel of a class without playing it. Do all designers on a class need to play or main that class? Nah. Does someone and ideally more than one person? Yeah, I think so. Not main necessarily, but they should have a feel for the changes they're asking us to deal with, especially when they do such big redesigns.</div></div><hr />

Mage shields get new spell effects (and a nerf) and people flip their shit.</div></div><hr />

Is that information somehow beneficial or helpful in analyzing the current percentile base of players that have accrued legendaries, even if it is unscientific?<br />
<br />
That way those that aren't playing don't just select &quot;zero&quot; when they are actually not playing at all and then skew the numbers.<br />

I haven't got any on any of my characters, 3 level 110s. Though I'm not mad as I haven't done a lot of Mythics, so I'm assuming that's where you most likely get one.<br />
<br />
I'm sure that that is actually the case, but oddly enough, with all the Mythic+ that I do I haven't received any of my 3 Legendaries (split between 2 characters) in Mythic+ content. I have received both of my mains Legendaries in Emerald Nightmare, and my Alts Legendary came during a normal Mythic dungeon.<br />
<br />
(I'm pretty confident I'm an outlier though.)<br />

At the moment, yeah, but after 7.1.5 Wind Shear will become your friend. When you interrupt an enemy cast with it, that will fire it off as well.</div></div><hr />

There's an option to view results, neither of which prevents them from lying. Point is, why even bother? It skews the results to begin with.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sure people can lie. No set of options or lack thereof is going to change that, but including &quot;Zero, but not playing&quot; gives the group of people that is responding to the poll the ability to accurately describe their situation.<br />
<br />
Without it, that would artificially inflate the &quot;Zero legendaries&quot; group without giving context as to wether or not they are actively playing the game, and as such it would skew the results. There is no way that having the extra option skews results in any way shape or form, it only offers context. I seriously don't see the problem.</div></div><hr />

Exactly. Adversarial systems work very well because they utilise vested interests to their advantage.<br />
<br />
What should happen is each dev should main a class or two but then be prevented from designing or proposing changes to said class. Instead, they should only have the power of negative feedback.</div></div><hr />

Agreed. Not sure why this particular part of the class was chosen to be &quot;improved&quot;.</div></div><hr />
