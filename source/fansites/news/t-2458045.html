<br />
Was just asking bout that on wowhead in the comments and that seems to be the case. best way is to make a ticket about it so maybe they can add it to the stolen presents box from the daily like all other older itmes before the event is over so we have a chance to get it before next year when they'll hopefully remember.<br />
<br />
<br />
Can I get all the gifts as 20lvl char with no sub?<br />
<br />
You can get all of em on lvl 20 chars. Not sure about the sub part though.</div></div><hr />

Got the presents. No sub, just an allied Race toon at lvl 20</div></div><hr />

<br />
You cannot get all the presents at 20. One requires level 40 (Ticking Present)</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. Hearthstation toy - it should be moved to Stolen Present loot table, but so far it didn't droped to anyone.<br />
2. Feat of Strength &quot;They're Both Footballs?&quot;. This is achiev for looting Foot Ball and Pigskin toys from Stolen Present on single character (Football/Pigskin from vendor are separated toys). However, they drop only once: so if you get them of two separate chars you won't be able to get achievement until Blizz will fix it (or change requirements for achiev).</div></div><hr />

Ofcourse it's not true, it never was, that's the entire point. Everytime there's a holiday (and this you can check for yourself, in old or future posts for every holiday) or somehow there's a news article mentioning something that falls in the category of &quot;a small thing has been added to the game&quot;, someone on mmo-c is copy-pasting same and same and same stuff in a cycle that repeats since more than 10 years. Same thing every holiday post. Same subjects, that signal the lack of content, lack of players playing the game, the death of wow, how the current expansion sucks and is the worst in all wow's xpacs, how we're doomed because 200 mounts are going to be added to the shop and so on. All these things have been repeated even in the times which today are widely recognized as good content patches/expansions -- ie: we've had no content posts in Legion, MoP too, we've had 'worst xpac ever' posts in Legion and MoP, expansions that are now being given as examples of successful expansions or expansions with lots of content.</div></div><hr />

Gotta be pretty petty if you complain about a xmas presents.</div></div><hr />

This; absolutely this.<br />
I feel that these outfits are way, way, way better than the blizcon cloaks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This entire expansion has alliance vs horde as its main theme, not sure you're aware (because you look surprised). Hence why most of what they do comes in 2 versions.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is true, however you can get both the new items at 20, which is all I cared about :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am aware, but why has the winter veil stuff need to be expansion themed. It already was last year. Boring.</div></div><hr />
