It took some time to have something working, but we can now provide you a decent list of the low level dungeon loot changes ! Basically, the PTR tooltip is on the left, the Live tooltip on the right, all the relevant item changes (Unique items becoming Unique-equipped, and sometimes +healing changed into +healing and 33% damage are excluded). Sometimes the version won't show up, it's a known bug but it's not really a problem. Example : [compare=32254,en,wh,2.3.0 (PTR);en,eu,2.2.3 (Live)]<br />

<br />
There are quick quests in Uldaman?<br />
Anyways, I'd sure go for a Scarlet run with a caster even though I'm a speed lvl guy. And in Temple of Atal Hakkar you can get up to level and a half, with those decent loots it sure looks as a good price.</div></div><hr />

No other changes than the +33% spell damage to all healing items / unique items turned into unique-equipped items / weapon ratings changed to equal expertise rating.&quot;<br />
<br />
Reallly surprised at that since i had seenm a blue post saying that no more green items would drop in teh dungeons. Are you certain that teh greens have not been removed from teh loot table in DM east? Lethendris there used to drop greens quite frequently, sometimes she didnt drop a blue at all.</div></div><hr />
