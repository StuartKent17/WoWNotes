Blizzard added a FAQ for the upcoming BattleTag feature to their new support site (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/3754945852) this afternoon.<br />
<br />
What is a Battle.net BattleTag?<br />
A BattleTag is a unified, player-chosen nickname that will identify you across all of Battle.net – in Blizzard Entertainment games, on our websites, and in our community forums. Similar to Real ID, BattleTags will give players on Battle.net a new way to find and chat with friends they've met in-game, form friendships, form groups, and stay connected across multiple Blizzard Entertainment games. BattleTags will also provide a new option for displaying public profiles.<br />
<br />
When will BattleTags go live?<br />
We will soon begin limited testing of some features and functionality of BattleTags in the Diablo III beta test, and the feature will be available to Diablo III players at launch. BattleTags will be integrated into other Blizzard games and services such as World of Warcraft and StarCraft II at some point in the future, but we don't have exact rollout plans to share just yet.<br />
<br />
Will my BattleTag be unique?<br />
A player's BattleTag is not unique, so you won't need to worry about whether your preferred name is available. You can use any name you wish, as long as it adheres to the BattleTag Naming Policy (http://us.battle.net/support/en/article/battletagnaming). Only one BattleTag can be associated with each Battle.net account.<br />
<br />
If my BattleTag isn't unique, what makes me uniquely identifiable? How will I know I'm adding the right friend to my friends list?<br />
Each BattleTag is automatically assigned a 4-digit BattleTag code, which combines with your chosen name to create a unique identifier (e.g. AwesomeGnome#3592). Your BattleTag and code are viewable when you log in to the Battle.net website and within the Diablo III beta client, and can be shared with other players who want to send you a friend request manually. You will also be able to send BattleTag friend requests list within the context of a game (by clicking a person's BattleTag when he or she sends you a message, for example) without knowing their BattleTag code. In either case, each player must mutually agree to become BattleTag friends.<br />
<br />
I'm not in the Diablo III beta – can I choose a BattleTag now anyway?<br />
Sure! You can pick your BattleTag now through Battle.net Account Management, regardless of whether you're participating in the Diablo III beta test. Simply visit the BattleTag creation page (http://www.battle.net/account/management/battletag-create.html) to get started. Make sure to choose a handle you will be happy with in the long term and that abides by our BattleTag Naming Policy (http://us.battle.net/support/en/article/battletagnaming), as you will be unable to change your BattleTag once you've selected it. We plan to provide a way for players to change their BattleTags in the future, but we don't have any further details to share just yet.<br />
<br />
Where will my BattleTag be seen?<br />
During the Diablo III beta test, your BattleTag will be seen in the Diablo III client (on friends lists and in chat), on the Diablo III forums, and in Battle.net Account Management. In the future, expect it to be displayed in other Blizzard games like StarCraft II and World of Warcraft on friends lists, in chat, or when making posts on their associated forums. We'll have further details on how and where your BattleTag will be displayed in the future.<br />
<br />
When will World of Warcraft and StarCraft II support BattleTags?<br />
Our plan is for all current and future Blizzard games to support BattleTags eventually. However, we don't have any announcements to make regarding when BattleTags will be integrated into World of Warcraft or StarCraft II at this time.<br />
<br />
Do I need to choose my BattleTag now?<br />
You will only be required to create a BattleTag now if you'd like to log in to the Diablo III beta client (beginning with an upcoming patch) or to use a Diablo III-related identity on the Diablo III forums. You will still be able to post on these forums using a World of Warcraft or StarCraft II character name if you wish.<br />
<br />
Will I still be able to display my character on my profile or Armory page?<br />
Armory profiles will be unaffected by the introduction of BattleTags. We'll have more information on how BattleTags will be integrated into existing games in the future.<br />
<br />
How will this affect World of Warcraft?<br />
BattleTags will add a new way for you to make friendships and communicate in World of Warcraft. For example, you'll be able to create cross-game, cross-realm friendships with your BattleTag, similar to the way Real ID works now. We'll have more details to share closer to the feature's launch.<br />
<br />
Will this affect my existing Real ID friendships?<br />
No. Your Real ID friendships will continue to exist, and all of the features and benefits of Real ID will remain available to you. BattleTags will simply give players another way to connect and communicate across Blizzard games. For example, if two players aren't Real ID friends but want to stay in touch across Battle.net, they'll be able to establish a BattleTag-based friendship; in the future, BattleTag friends will have access to many of the communication benefits (such as cross-game chat) currently available to Real ID friends.<br />
<br />
Do BattleTags replace Real ID? Can I create new Real ID friendships?<br />
BattleTags are a new feature separate from Real ID. Real ID will continue to work as it always has, and you can continue to create Real ID friendships with people you know in real life.<br />
<br />
Will this affect my World of Warcraft or StarCraft II character names in any way?<br />
Your World of Warcraft character names will continue to exist and work as they currently do. We're still in the process of determining how we will handle StarCraft II character names once BattleTags are integrated into the game.<br />
<br />
How does my BattleTag work in the Diablo III beta?<br />
Only some BattleTag features will be available during the Diablo III beta test. At first, players will be able to add friends to their friends list using their BattleTags, though new or different features may be available at different times during the testing process. We'll have more information on all of the features of BattleTags in Diablo III with the launch of the game next year.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's still relevant to WoW players as it will be integrated into the game at some point. Also, many WoW players will be playing Diablo 3.<br />
<br />
If you feel it's not relevant to you, don't read it. Simple.</div></div><hr />

In their post they didnt say you'd get all the benefits of readID, just the communication aspects of it. With realID you can bg and dung together.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You'll probably be able to do everything you can via real id through battle.net id except maybe some facebook stuff. This was one of the most requested features when real ID was coming out. This is basically for those that want the benefits of real ID but don't feel comfortable giving real life details to people.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And I quote from the FAQ:<br />
<br />
&quot;BattleTags will add a new way for you to make friendships and communicate in World of Warcraft. For example, you'll be able to create cross-game, cross-realm friendships with your BattleTag, similar to the way Real ID works now. We'll have more details to share closer to the feature's launch.&quot;<br />

What exactly would be the point of a cross-realm friendship if you can't do ANYTHING with it?</div></div><hr />

You don't give them your email and they don't see your real name. Its basically just a xrealm friends list you can use to do dungeons and bgs together.</div></div><hr />

While I&quot;m not sure why Blizzard is providing this in a separate feature rather than adding to Real ID, I'm still thrilled that it's being worked in.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DeanyKong</div><div class="date">2011-12-15, 10:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is basically a rename of Real ID...wtf is the point of this waste of development resources.

<br />
Because now you don't have to give away your real name and email to people who you'd like to talk to across different realms or games. And yes, it is just a rename of RealID, so no, it wasn't a waste of development resources. This was one guy copy/pasting code over.<br />
<br />
Also, why don't you cancel your sub? It'll really show Blizzard who's boss!</div></div><hr />

<br />
It doesn't seem to be... except that it coexists with RealID.<br />
<br />
It should overtake and replace RealID, but ... won't? I don't know what Blizz is up to here. How many logins, IDs, tags... and crap do we need?</div></div><hr />

Having this and RealID side by side isn't bad by any means, it just doesn't make much sense. It will just end up confusing people.</div></div><hr />

Thats the entire idea behind this, you do get that right?<br />
Using this you can add someone that you met during a LFG/LFR/BG without them knowing your real name.<br />
This does exactly what you claim you want.<br />
And yet you complain.<br />
Really.</div></div><hr />

...............................<br />
So, what was the purpose of Real ID in the first place?Targeted advertising.Back in July 2010, Blizzard had planned targeted advertising within Starcraft 2. They entered into a contract with Microsoft's Massive Inc. to deliver in-game advertisements within Starcraft 2.Coincidentally, this was also around the same time that REAL ID was announced. :)Real ID caused a scandal and it failed, and then within about a month, Blizzard cancelled their contract and pulled the plug on their Microsoft partnership and SC2 in-game advertising. It's almost as if in-game (targeted) advertising was dependent on the Real ID system. :)Having a constant flow of 10-20 million players per day and access to a very sophisticated targeting advertising platform, Blizzard can reap a MASSIVE amount of profit by entering into the advertising business. (Targeted advertising is bigger than most people realize. It's where Google's immense wealth came from.)Their first in-game advertising attempt failed due to Real ID &quot;1.0&quot;. But, now they have Real ID 2.0, and a new monster to deliver in-game advertising<br />
..............................<br />
A certain type of game would be needed to accommodate in-game ads. Something that matches our real world more closely; a modern world, with virtual billboards, radio, and TV. And that brings us to Titan.Titan is rumored to be similar to Second Life, it will have a lot of characters (NPCs) within it, there are a large number of environments, and it might have more of a real (or modern) world feel to it. If so, a world like this would be perfect for in-game ads and linking real world items with in-game purchases or vice versa. (RL ads to get you buying virtual items, and in-game ads getting you to buy RL items.)A lot of this can be done through a Real Money Auction House, which you can bet will be implemented in Titan if the D3 testing is successful. Titan would be perfect for a large quantity of items, homes, or furnishings that can be created or sold. Personally, I don't think there will be houses or land for sale, but I do think there will be a large number of vanity items that can be crafted or sold for real money.(Even if there are multiple environments, like the historical and ancient cities that have been hinted at, advertising would still be possible whether they're at a certain hub, meeting place, or even in these environments depending on suitability.)<br />
<br />
<br />
I think it's all part of a greater plan. Like Blizzard said, Titan is their most ambitious project ever. And all of these systems or strategies are very easy to implement, they're practical, and they're highly lucrative. Diablo 3 and now the REAL ID 2.0 is only a testing ground for Titan. It's just going to take a few years of nudging players into the right direction and adjusting their personal level of acceptance. You can call it &quot;manipulation&quot; if you want.. the description is apt. <br />
<br />
<br />
We're being prepared for Titan right now, and one thing that needs to happen is gamer acceptance. Now the mechanics to milk us our money are being implemented 1 by 1 .</div></div><hr />

More likely is them bring out a steam style digital download service.<br />
<br />

/tar kitten<br />
/cast Power Word:Shield<br />
<br />
If you look on the product schedule there is something called &quot;Bnet 3rd parties&quot; which points to a digital download store to me.<br />

<br />
Mostly because people were probably using their main email address as their battle.net email.<br />
<br />
IMHO Your battle.net email should be treated with the same level of confidentiality as your password. <br />
<br />
And I'm not sure if &quot;confidentiality&quot; fits here. Basically I mean it should not be one that's easily guessed by anyone - it shouldn't be connected to you , your world of warcraft toon , your real name or anything that anyone who knows you or has your facebook profile can guess.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's assuming the limit is 4 digits , 1 - 9999<br />
<br />
This assumption would be based on what you can see of the length of current Battle Tags. Blizzard hasn't stated how longthat number actually is in the system and I so far haven't seen a post from the development team about it.<br />
<br />
It's entirely possibly that the number at the end of the Battle Tag is stored in a variable that has a much larger limit but the leading zeros are automatically stripped when it's displayed or used. For example the SC2 system started out with 3 digits and went to 4 I believe.<br />
<br />
So for example mine is &quot;bluspacecow #1174&quot;. It could be stored internally as &quot;bluspacecow #00000000000001174&quot; but the leading zeros are ignored or stripped out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
each BattleTag is automatically assigned a 4-digit BattleTag code<br />

I share these concerns. Also:<br />
<br />
<br />
In the future, expect it to be displayed in other Blizzard games like StarCraft II and World of Warcraft on friends lists, in chat, or when making posts on their associated forums.<br />
<br />
Surely they don't mean trade/guild/general chat? But knowing Blizzard I could be wrong.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The primary changes are the removal of the email address requirement, so you can &quot;friend&quot; people who you would not be happy to share an email address with.<br />
You can also have a chosen tag, so that you can be identified by a familliar name rather than a real one which would mean nothing to someone else, or you simply want to keep to yourself.<br />
If anything thats a huge improvement to privacy.<br />
<br />
Yes I do agree that an &quot;appear offline&quot; or similar toggle would be welcome however, a feature I have discussed in the past.</div></div><hr />

Because Activision/Blizzard is only the financial entity that manages the resources of Activision and Blizzard Entertainment. Blizzard Entertainment is the entity you have design issues with. All platforms have gravitated to this concept to one degree or another. By in large it is only a convenience to everyone involved.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Then they do as StarCraft 2 did and use an extra digit.<br />
<br />
People are assuming that because the FAQ says it assigns a 4 digit number that the limit of the variable used to store that number is 4 digits.<br />
<br />
It's probably not and only displaying 4 digits for simplicity.</div></div><hr />

&quot;BattleTags will add a new way for you to make friendships and communicate in World of Warcraft.

What exactly would be the point of a cross-realm friendship if you can't do ANYTHING with it?<br />
