<br />
<br />
<br />
Heart of Azeroth<br />
<br />
Some of the active powers on the Heart of Azeroth will be things like shields or buffs.<br />
One of the ways the team has fallen short this expansion is realizing that the Heart of Azeroth isn't as important to players as the Legion weapons, which were a part of the player's story from start to finish.<br />
Ion says that the Magni, Azeroth, and the dying Titan plot is coming to the forefront in Patch 8.2. <br />
The Battle over Azeroth will actually turn into a Battle for Azeroth, and the Heart of Azeroth is getting gameplay reworks to match the emotional importance of the story.<br />
<br />
New Zones<br />
<br />
Both Nazjatar and Mechagon will be flying enabled.<br />
Nazjatar will be a little more of typical zone with new things.<br />
Mechagon is described as a sandbox-y, unpredictable playground.<br />
<br />
Character Growth<br />
<br />
Ion admits that the culling of abilities, loss of legendaries, and lack of endgame talents makes your character feel less fun to play at max level from Legion.<br />
For the rest of Battle for Azeroth, the team will be looking at talents from a tuning perspective and a diversity perspective. Talents no one picks may be designed and improved.<br />
Changes to talents as a whole will be something for a whole other expansion.<br />
In the past, talent trees had filler talents that felt mandatory to play the class, and they weren't infinitely extensible.<br />
The reasoning behind not adding a new row of talents for level 120 was that many classes didn't need three new abilities, and so the row would have been filler or shore up weaknesses in classes and remove counterplay. Ion admits this may have gone too far though.<br />
The team is looking at ways for characters to improve meaningfully and permanently at the endgame, and Nazjatar and Mechagon will be new ways to try rewards that aren't tied to core gameplay loops for each class.<br />
<br />
Story and Player Role<br />
<br />
There has been a lot of strong opinions on the story so far because there are a lot of strong connections to the characters.<br />
The team realizes that in trying to evoke emotion in the story, going to far with it can put the player in a situation that they don't want to be in, and this is why player choice has come into certain quests.<br />
They want people to stick around and see the end of the story that they are telling.<br />
The Horde is not blind to the fact that they have gone down dark paths before with Garrosh in Pandaria.<br />
Garrosh had different motives than Sylvanas. We still don't know what her true goals are.<br />
There will not be a trial where Sylvanas is in chains. She is not a character that would find herself in that situation ever.<br />
There will be more player decisions in the future with real consequences.<br />
The team intends to avoid false choices or the illusion of branching narratives.<br />
Ion hints that the Alliance doesn't have the choices the Horde faces...yet. They don't want to force it because the Alliance doesn't have the same division in its ranks right now.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Cross Realm Mythic Battle of Dazar'alor Next Reset<br />
The Alliance Hall of Fame (https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-US/game/hall-of-fame/mythic-raid/battle-of-dazaralor?faction=ALLIANCE) reached 100 Guilds clearing Mythic Lady Jaina Proudmoore yesterday. This means that as of next reset, players will now be able to clear the raid on mythic cross realm. For Alliance guilds still working on Jaina, you have until reset to still receive Hall of Fame: Lady Jaina Proudmoore (Alliance) (https://www.wowdb.com/achievements/13326-hall-of-fame-lady-jaina-proudmoore-alliance). After that, it will no longer be available.<br />

<br />
A lot of people but the majority is people that just like to collect shit , tmogs , mounts achievements and stuff and people that still raid.<br />
Tmog is the real progression now since its the only thing that can't titanforge and its unique :P</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wyattbw09</div><div class="date">2019-04-08, 12:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I half think they are playing with words by specifically saying not in chains. Yes, she is a banshee and can lose her physical form, so yeah chains is not in her future. She might well be captured and put on trial, but it won’t be in chains.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jibjub</div><div class="date">2019-04-08, 12:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Unless they completely remove the concept of &quot;Artifact Power&quot; the next expansion, they have learned nothing.<br />
<br />
The concept can work if done well. But if they do AP, it should replace the gear treadmill. Having both is awful. I would much rather prefer no longer having to grind gear with every patch and instead of a more &quot;horizontal&quot; progression that something like AP and artifacts traits could provide for the duration of an expansion.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eleccybubb</div><div class="date">2019-04-08, 12:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ion admits that the culling of abilities, loss of legendaries, and lack of endgame talents makes your character feel less fun to play at max level from Legion.<br />
<br />
Then just revert the design and work around it. Stop saying &quot;oh this was bad&quot; then proceeding not to do shit about it. It's downright patronising to the playerbase.<br />
<br />
Nazjatar will be a little more of typical zone with new things.<br />
<br />
Pretty sure they said this about Timeless Isle, Tanaan, Broken Shore and Argus and yet nothing actually brand new came of it.<br />
<br />
There will not be a trial where Sylvanas is in chains. She is not a character that would find herself in that situation ever.<br />
<br />
I'd say something about this but I think it's safe to say this is to do with the &quot;muh diversity&quot; writing within ActiBlizz recently.<br />
<br />
The reasoning behind not adding a new row of talents for level 120 was that many classes didn't need three new abilities, and so the row would have been filler or shore up weaknesses in classes and remove counterplay. Ion admits this may have gone too far though.<br />
<br />
No. Just no. Stop pretending that it would have been the case and you couldn't have added new actives or passives. It's just because it would require putting some actual effort into the game.<br />
<br />
In the past, talent trees had filler talents that felt mandatory to play the class, and they weren't infinitely extensible.<br />
<br />
So bloody what? It actually felt RPG like when you got a point to spend every level rather than once every 15 levels. You felt your character grow even if it was forced or small.<br />
<br />
So overall another pointless interview with absolutely nothing that addresses the games issues or Ion just going &quot;yeah that's an issue or we wish we didn't do that&quot; and yet proceeds not to fix said issue.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I recently subbed again to check out the quests etc that came with 8.1.5. I then decided to level a KT Monk. I never really bothered playing a monk and I like how being a monk fits the big KT.<br />
<br />
Theres also Brawlers guild, and I love that.<br />
<br />
I play lot less, but im still subbed. I get a few hours knocked out from it coming weeks.</div></div><hr />

Quite a lot. I think that WoW is at its peak right now. Much more than Legion, that's for sure.<br />

I don't want a new abilities. My bars already filled with all sort of abilities. A little clean-up won't hurt, that's for sure. They should learn from HotS and other modern games. Few abilities are enough.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You know, this, this right here. I wish more people could see this example of why so many people feel like devs are not listening. Literally people have 180 degrees opposite opinion about this and many more topics, but they will keep bitching about it on forums non-stop, claiming that devs are incompetent because they didn't satisfy their and their group desire.<br />
<br />
Althought, I'm glad you expressed it in a way to reflect your own opinion &quot;I don't want a new abilities&quot;, unlike some individuals who think they speak for all</div></div><hr />

It's one thing to look at a piece of gear or quest and say 'man that could've gone better. ' It's a completely different story when the main focal point of the entire storyline is brought into question towards the end of the content release.<br />
<br />
This is either laziness, overconfidence in the team, or a combination of both to come in so late and say the main item in the storyline is flawed.<br />

Just remembere, once the last content patch is released you'll have at least a little over a year until you see something new. :(</div></div><hr />

This will never happen. They have found the model where you just add hp, attack, damage - numbers, where you add + to mythic instances - and voila - with new patch you just have to tune numbers a bit - and new grindfest for m+, artifact, heart continues. Just increase level cap - and you can farm again for the same generic nameless items. Perfect play model imo - do nothing, but still earn money. I am surprised they didnt introduce m+ mode for raids - they could postphone new content for years! Such economy of money!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MasterHamster</div><div class="date">2019-04-08, 01:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's a bit tragicomical to watch the Q&amp;As and interviews slowly but surely making it more and more clear that Blizzard has been caught off-guard by just how much damage all the tiny cuts has done to the game. All these hard-to-measure, subsconscious things that has eventually led WoW to a path where it has lost it's soul and ability to retain players. They seem to slowly, in a mounting panic, realize that the game doesn't captivate players anymore. Introduce entire new continents, new storylines, create more and more perfected, streamlined content, and watch players just blaze through it, bored and mashing buttons at random, never failing at anything. Because you know, nothing is more exciting than a game you can't fail at until you run premade raids.<br />
<br />
<br />
It's a bit like watching a dam that has always had a budget for more emergency repairs eventually start to crack faster than emergency concrete can be produced. Players are not playing BFA like players used to play WoW. It's for laidback players who doesn't play more than maybe 10 hours per week at most, and those who are fine with pushing mythic. Intermediate players, those who perhaps doesn't want to raid, yet want to progress meaningfully, has been left behind. Throwing gear at me for close to zero effort doesn't actually cater to me, if I feel like there's no meaningful content worth doing. You literally have to raid in endgame to make gear feel meaningful, or fight timers in M+ (instead of, you know, being challenged by the content itself instead of time passing). It's actually okay to expect players to do well in order to succeed even in a Heroic dungeon, or an Island Expedition. Why the hell was Warfronts designed to be win-by-default? And then they talk about introducing a Heroic version... which of course requires a fucking premade. Can't expect players to be able to communicate otherwise!<br />
<br />
<br />
All this new content, beautifully crafted, is just thrown away in Blizzards neverending quest to satisfy every single type of player there is. A cliché that never fails to be applicable to WoW since MoP is that if you try to please everyone you'll end up satisfying no one. WoW needs to pick it's target demographic, instead of trying to be a Facebook game and Dark Souls raiding at the same time.<br />
<br />
<br />
Just stop with making all non-endgame content so easy a comatose vegetable randomly pressing 1-5 will defeat it. Stop designing dungeons around 20 min zerg fests, stop designing all solo content around being easily soloable in green gear. Now Blizzard is making it clear they've heard that there's a problem and want to redesign the reward-structure and power progression of characters, well that is great! But what does it f'ing matter if all content is easy with or without azerite traits, or new talents anyway?! Why the fuck should I even care about my character becoming stronger, when I can see literally all content on base difficulty within two days at 120?I already know that when 8.2 drops all my characters that I've barely touched the last half year will be ready to head directly to Nazjatar and Mechagon? <br />
There's geninely zero doubt in my mind that the moment 8.2 is released I can just waltz over there, no effort required. How exciting! Nothing like an MMORPG without a proper progression-ladder. Instead we have self-contained content-seasons.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lachlol</div><div class="date">2019-04-08, 02:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There has been a lot of strong opinions on the story so far because there are a lot of strong connections to the characters.<br />
<br />
Well, I'd say that strong opinions are rather the outcome of a terrible narration, than strong connections.<br />
<br />
<br />
They want people to stick around and see the end of the story that they are telling.<br />
<br />
The problem is MMORPG is not the best medium to tell complex stories, because it lacks the dynamics. And this is exactly what they are trying to do: throw in as many plotlines as possible; make some shady deals between characters and unclear motives behind their decisions. It just doesn't hold together. <br />
Now I read that Magni and Azeroth's Titan-soul are coming to the forefront. It always amused me, that we stay on a planet with a giant sword stuck in it, and it seems like nobody really cares. If I were an Azerothian, that would trouble me the most, but OK.<br />
So many bad decision from the writting team, damn. Not so good... not good at all.<br />
<br />
Few days ago Ion has been asked (Buffed.de interview), if he could imagine Azeroth completely destroyed. He replied that it's hard to imagine WoW 2.0 not being in Azeroth, and that drastic changes can still occur, like the sword in Silithus. But how did it change gameplay or story? How in the world is that a drastic change? <br />
Azerite is meaningless - it's just a resource made up from nothing for the sake of warfare theme storytelling.<br />
<br />
Hands down. I'd prefer if that did not give as many interviews. I'm not sure if they are disconnected from the playerbase. I'm nearly sure that he understands exactly what a mess it is, but talk this trash to prove they care. <br />
<br />
Ion, just stop. Do the work properly or drop it with your team, and forward your duties to someone who has at least a shred of an idea of what to do.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What he's really saying is the alliance isn't worth using develop time. Into giving them a meaningful story because we just want the horde to have the options. There still sticking by there horde bias. Come on Activision lay some of these idiots off and hire some new writers/devs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I believe that comes mainly from the PvP side of things, where if they do huge changes mid season people would get upset, also, I suppose a little from the Mythic Raiding/Dungeons as people would claim one side or the other of the change had an advantage.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Claymore</div><div class="date">2019-04-08, 02:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If I'm being honest, it kind of feels like every interview with Ion, he seems aware that something is &quot;off&quot; with Battle for Azeroth, but the team doesn't really know what exactly it is, or how to fix it.<br />
<br />
Which to that, I'm at least going to say kudos for him being fairly vocal and transparent about their design philosophies. Even though a lot of the interviews feel like &quot;Well, we didn't really learn anything new&quot;, it's at least good they're talking about where they're at.<br />
<br />
I feel like there's kind of a two-fold issue at play, though. The first -- and completely out of their hands -- is the simple fact that WoW has clearly outlived any original plans they may have had for it. So they're kind of scrambling to keep it going, without a lot of clear direction on &quot;what new features need to be added, where the story needs to go, etc&quot;. The second issue, though, is that it sort of feels like the game's being designed by &quot;the new kids&quot;, because the game's identity feels very different from where WoW started. It's one of those things that's hard to pinpoint, but I think most would agree, the game just &quot;feels&quot; different (for better or worse).<br />
<br />
I hope that WoW Classic sees success, or at least generates enough of a reaction to give Blizzard some insight as to where the *current* WoW needs to go. Because it definitely feels like the game is lacking any sort of overarching &quot;vision&quot; right now. Maybe WoW Classic will inspire the devs to return to more RPG-heavy roots, maybe change their way of storytelling, any number of things.</div></div><hr />

Isn't this mutually exclusive? You either have real choices and thus the narratives branch (like some people will follow Sylvanas and some won't) or the narrative doesn't branch and then you'll have false choices, because whatever you choose, it will always lead to the same outcome.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MasterHamster</div><div class="date">2019-04-08, 02:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If I'm being honest, it kind of feels like every interview with Ion, he seems aware that something is &quot;off&quot; with Battle for Azeroth, but the team doesn't really know what exactly it is, or how to fix it.<br />
<br />
Which to that, I'm at least going to say kudos for him being fairly vocal and transparent about their design philosophies. Even though a lot of the interviews feel like &quot;Well, we didn't really learn anything new&quot;, it's at least good they're talking about where they're at.<br />
<br />
I feel like there's kind of a two-fold issue at play, though. The first -- and completely out of their hands -- is the simple fact that WoW has clearly outlived any original plans they may have had for it. So they're kind of scrambling to keep it going, without a lot of clear direction on &quot;what new features need to be added, where the story needs to go, etc&quot;. The second issue, though, is that it sort of feels like the game's being designed by &quot;the new kids&quot;, because the game's identity feels very different from where WoW started. It's one of those things that's hard to pinpoint, but I think most would agree, the game just &quot;feels&quot; different (for better or worse).<br />
<br />
I hope that WoW Classic sees success, or at least generates enough of a reaction to give Blizzard some insight as to where the *current* WoW needs to go. Because it definitely feels like the game is lacking any sort of overarching &quot;vision&quot; right now. Maybe WoW Classic will inspire the devs to return to more RPG-heavy roots, maybe change their way of storytelling, any number of things.<br />
<br />
To me, it's like a case of watching a game become overly perfected. Overengineered. Blizzard has tried, and pretty successfully managed, to iron out all the rough edges of a game that is inself pretty intrinsic to MMORPGs.<br />
<br />
I am going to make a silly comparison, if people who needed to lose weight could simply get a free, all-encompassing surgery to remove all excess fat and suddenly became athletic and fit, I can bet a thousand dollar for every diet coke in the world that the people who chose this route wouldn't really be as happy as if they had exercised, changed their lifestyle, and worked for it. You can't just jump to the goal just because that's where you &quot;want to be&quot;. You don't watch a movie just to skip to the last scene. The path to the goal is what gives the goal a meaning.<br />
<br />
But as a game, WoW abandoned this in favor of catapulting people to the goal. They forgot that the lack of obstacles is a major contribution as to why people don't feel attached to their characters or feel satisfied what they've accomplished. Now every expansion just wants to get you to the very end as smoothly as possible, so you can jump into the very latest raid. I am certain people are going to be very perplexed when they see just how captivating WoW Classic is, regardless of how rough and archaic it is. Clearing Deadmines probably earns more satisfaction than the entire BFA dungeon repertoire. Because Deadmines (or any Classic dungeon) isn't designed to make sure you win without a hitch. It doesn't apologize for expecting players to play properly. That is certainly not how current WoW is designed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Interesting analogy, but I totally get what you mean, and think there's probably a lot of truth to that.<br />
<br />
I also think part of it is that, narratively speaking, we've kind of accomplished everything that the original Warcraft fiction had laid out before out. I mean, we've finally toppled *Sargeras*. They've obviously now introduced the Void Lords, but it seems pretty clear that this new threat hasn't really resonated with players, nor has the &quot;Horde vs. Alliance&quot; conflict. Even though that stuff isn't *directly* related to gameplay, I think it's still pretty important stuff. A big reason people loved Wrath was that it revolved around Arthas and the Scourge, all stuff that people were clearly into. It feels like Blizzard is grasping at straws, trying to find *some* kind of a story-hook that's compelling enough to capture players' attention.<br />
<br />
Some of the &quot;Old God&quot; stuff shows promise -- particularly the &quot;vision&quot; N'zoth showed Azshara, with deserts covered in pyramids and obelisks in tribute to the Old Gods. That's probably a much cooler route to go with the &quot;Void Lords&quot;, than the bland &quot;purple energy&quot; stuff seen in the Void Elves' &quot;starter area&quot;.</div></div><hr />

I agree, however all of this was addressed by beta testers (like me) prior to BFA. I myself specifically reported that the necklace alone would be fine if they want to continue the AP grind, but the tying of the necklace to other gear was an unnecessary and confusing addition; guess what they are now reverting to doing? I also reported during beta that the culling of abilities went too far and rotations have become stale on every class, but again they didn't listen. So, they've been told by the fans time and time again but they simply refuse to listen (or, perhaps, have an inability to decipher good feedback from whining).</div></div><hr />

I legit chuckled at that. But really, it does touch on a really important point, and one of the reasons I'm not feeling the story right now. It seems like they're picking an &quot;end-point&quot;, and just writing the story to try and get us there, instead of letting things progress naturally. They clearly want Sylvanas to represent &quot;the strong, independent woman that's ready for everything&quot; and can never appear &quot;weak&quot; or &quot;vulnerable&quot;. Really, they're writing the character with the intent of being a feminist icon, instead of just having a strong, compelling character (which means also having human emotions and flaws that aren't &quot;cool&quot;).<br />
<br />

<br />
Yes they made a lot of mistakes. But AP wasnt, ap was a refined system from the legion version and it worked, it did what it was ment for, giving the player the &quot;grind&quot; of an rpg beyond max lvl. BUT the problem, the Azerite gear, few talents, few combinations not many ways to obtain it, they mess up everything. The Laser matrix stacks, the one trick traits, traits that were better independent from ilvl, i still remember resto shamans using 340 gear because one talent was better than the 375 ones. WHats the point of grinding something if the reward its lackluster, bad, unnisterested. I preffer level up new characters for the Heritage than grinding my neck lvl 48.<br />
<br />
Yes they tested a lot of new mechanics and systems, trying to make better older systems, and finally they just saw that the old systems were better. 3 man scenarios were better than the midless Island Expeditions. Grand open scale BGs (Wintergasp Tol Barad even Ashran) were better than instanced Warfronts (wich literally are BGs vs the lower tier of AI)<br />
<br />
I have high hopes for 8.2 to being the start of the &quot;reseting&quot; of WoW, the backlash from the community, from the content creators that Blizzard supported in many of their videos, the overall negativity surrounding BfA becase they tryi to use this expansion as a Big Beta for new Systems and its seems they are still doing it on 8.2 with the knowledge of the failure of 8.0 and 8.1.<br />
<br />
They even experimented with Story and Lore and ended with what?, people dont even know whats the difference between the Honor that the orcs talk and the Honor for a Troll or a Belf, night elves lost their identity and merged within the Souther Stormwind Human Kingdom.<br />
<br />
Reading all of this Interviews makes me feel uneasy and a bit of &quot;men they f* it up so badly, you know when shits go real when Ion says &quot; may have gone too far&quot; you know that, they didnt prepare BfA, maybe this expansion was made 3 years ago and they didnt use anything else, maybe blizzard didnt expanded the systems because why? they just work on Draenor on Legion? Or maybe this is old development from years ago and it actually ended on 8.1. Who knows.<br />
<br />
I really cant wait for the Ptr, to see if i will be dissapointed or very proud to say that i played Bfa from start to end.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thedrun</div><div class="date">2019-04-08, 04:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;One of the ways the team has fallen short this expansion is realizing that the Heart of Azeroth isn't as important to players as the Legion weapons, which were a part of the player's story from start to finish.&quot;<br />
<br />
This seemed fairly obvious from the beginning. Just for obtaining the Legion weapons each one had their own storyline tailored to the class and/or spec using it (sometimes being completely unique to a single class+spec, like Guardian Druid), sending you to various places across the world to retrieve it. When you were leveling the choice of which traits to open first in your weapon had a sizeable impact, but ultimately with no &quot;wrong&quot; decision long term because you'd eventually get everything, or could respec. Each weapon had an extensive storyline that opened up as you researched the weapons history at your class-specific base. Also you could get a different weapon for each of your specs, experiencing even more story.<br />
<br />
On the other side, the neck was obtained in what felt like maybe 5 minutes of Magni talking at you and some light combat, and that experience was the same for everyone. Not particularly landmark. As far as I can tell there hasn't been any effort within the story to really expand on the origins or purpose of the Heart of Azeroth either - I guess those few times we revisited the chamber for the ilvl bump might count? Hopefully things expand here in 8.2 as they've hinted. <br />
<br />
Mechanically speaking the neck benefits in BFA are more indirect, and thus feel less important. The neck accumulates up AP just like the weapons did, but this in and of itself provides little benefit, just an ilvl bump on the neck. On top of racking up the AP you have to go and track down azerite armor to see the really tangible benefits, and for many class/specs it has to be very particular armor pieces in order to see good benefits. Then there's re-earning the same trait unlocks but at a higher ilvl - there's been plenty of feedback about how bad this idea was so I won't go into it. Also as one more slight, if you want to flip traits on your armor frequently - to fine tune or to switch specs or whatever - the respec system this time around was much more costly as well. Either get duplicate armor pieces or shell out piles of gold. The weapons were a bit painful here as multi-speccing meant multiple weapons to grind AP for, but at least once the benefits were earned they were always available and didn't require being nickel-and-dimed with respec costs. The Artifact Knowledge system helped ease the grind for multiple weapons as well.<br />
<br />
With all these differences it seems pretty apparent more consideration and work was put into the weapons than the neck and that the weapons had a more distinctive and clear impact on the player. So it shouldn't come as any surprise that the neck wasn't as appreciated by the players.<br />
<br />
Edit: Forgot one other point - it's a neck piece. You don't even see it = P</div></div><hr />

It's starting to sound like there's like a cycle for people's interest in the game, and we've gone through it a few times and it's just turned into this pattern now. Like forget all about the game and what it used to be about, this is like a biological pattern in people's brains now, the ones that stuck around for long enough to still be around, and like.... that's all this is... a cycle of emotions damming up in one end until they break the dam and it starts building up in the other end.... until they break the dam and so forth and so forth.<br />

There's a difference between getting out of said situation and not getting into it in the first place.<br />

Sylvanas has literally deities and god-like entities who want her dead right now. She'd be lucky to be granted the mercy of a trial at this point. Why the other leaders of the Horde haven't just overthrown her yet is beyond me.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Freeasacar</div><div class="date">2019-04-08, 10:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In the past, talent trees had filler talents that felt mandatory to play the class, and they weren't infinitely extensible.<br />
Many classes still do. Try playing a Rogue with no talents selected. It doesn't just drop your DPS but makes the class nearly unplayable. This is why both Outlaw and Sin have been using cookie-cutter specs since the start of Legion. You don't enhance your class by selecting talents as a Rogue, you literally build it up from nothing. Meanwhile other classes like Hunters mostly only have talents that boost their existing abilities and you can play the class just fine without them. Abilities like Slice and Dice and Leeching Poison should not still be on the talent tree.<br />
<br />
<br />
Garrosh had different motives than Sylvanas. We still don't know what her true goals are.<br />
We do though. If you talk to Nathanos on the Banshee's Wail he says her goal is to turn as many Stormwind humans into Forsaken as possible and get Anduin to kneel before her. Assumedly the rest of the Alliance would follow after. That's already a pretty hefty goal to strive for. If there really is something else then she's just getting greedy.</div></div><hr />

BfA is flat down terrible.<br />
<br />
No, it's not. There are some problems, but overall it's one of the greatest WoW addons ever, along with Cataclysm and Draenor.<br />

<br />
<br />
I left WoW for FF14 two months ago, and I never look back. How can anyone can still play WoW in this state with all that empty and broken promises behind it? <br />
<br />
How could anyone play chinese anime game?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
And the fact that they're still using the same stale mechanics within the game for 15 years while other MMORPGs can allow you to at least scale you character size.<br />
<br />
Those mechanics are not stale, they are solid and fun. I have no idea why would I want to scale my character size, but there are numerous toys and other ways to do that in WoW. You can play Gigagnome or microtauren if you want.</div></div><hr />

When I saw they werent even a talent in BFA was just crazy, Thing is there's already traits and trinkets that give<br />
shields so why add more? Its like the concept of actually adding brand new abilities is alient to them.<br />
remove a load of things then bring them back like its some amazing step forward.</div></div><hr />

If I'm being honest, it kind of feels like every interview with Ion, he seems aware that something is &quot;off&quot; with Battle for Azeroth, but the team doesn't really know what exactly it is, or how to fix it.<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't get that feeling at all. With the access to date that they have internally, I think he knows exactly what the problem is, it's just he and &quot;the team&quot; are unwilling to fix the core issues, and instead shuffle the deck chairs around to try and make it look like they fixed it. Class design is THE issue, and he just said &quot;Yeah, we're not changing it until another expansion.&quot; Either he is too timid from pushback from the class team, or he's all in with how it stinks on ice. Or if he pulls the class team off working on 9.0, 9.0 is delayed. They can't touch GCD, because they'd have to retune the entire game to match it. Not happening. So let's drone on and on about azerite and the necklace, which nobody has any fucks to give for, so you'll all forget how bad the GCD is, how piss poor the classes are, how warfronts were an utter failure, how Islands are hated, etc. <br />
<br />
This is the third interview where it's supposed to be about NEW content, but he spends most of his time rationalizing past mistakes, and making vague, hand waving comments about how [eyes squinted] &quot;they just don't quite get what the problem is&quot;.<br />
<br />
I'd buy that, if this was the first time he'd said something like that. But it's not. Which is why I think it's just more patronizing and placating. <br />
<br />
When the wave of activity over allied races and leveling dies off, &quot;the team&quot; is in deep shit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Uhh...you think? This is something players have been saying for YEARS since the MoP talent overhall. It was a dumb idea and terrible when it comes to character customization and fun. One of the fun parts of the old talent system was how at endgame when new content came out, you could completely change your talents and playstyle if you wanted / needed.<br />
<br />
The current system is way more set and forget.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
For the rest of Battle for Azeroth, the team will be looking at talents from a tuning perspective and a diversity perspective. Talents no one picks may be designed and improved.<br />
<br />
Bandaid. <br />
<br />
<br />
Changes to talents as a whole will be something for a whole other expansion.<br />
<br />
When? Two expansions from now? Three?<br />
<br />
<br />
In the past, talent trees had filler talents that felt mandatory to play the class, and they weren't infinitely extensible.<br />
<br />
Lies and falsities.<br />
<br />
The reasoning behind not adding a new row of talents for level 120 was that many classes didn't need three new abilities, and so the row would have been filler or shore up weaknesses in classes and remove counterplay. Ion admits this may have gone too far though.<br />
<br />
<br />
Bad reasoning. Next.<br />
<br />
<br />
The team is looking at ways for characters to improve meaningfully and permanently at the endgame, and Nazjatar and Mechagon will be new ways to try rewards that aren't tied to core gameplay loops for each class.<br />
<br />
There are several ways to do this. Not EVERYTHING needs to be linked to progression. People would be happy with new cool gear aesthetics, new pets, new mounts. People would love to go on a storyline for a new form like the Night Elves did. Or maybe a Hunter / Warlock could get a new pet quest chain. There are so many ways to give incentive for players to do content.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Everything else you say is true, but this in particular annoys me. It's an Artifact-tier item for pete's sake. The same as storied weapons like Ashbringer, Doomhammer or the Scepter of Sargeras. But they make it a damn neck that you never see apart from a canned animation when you harvest Azerite. Seeking the different Artifact skins in Legion was fun and made me spent more time on alts than in any other expansion by a huge margin to get the cool hidden/balance of power/mage tower skins. Who decided the thing had to be an item you almost never see, use or interact with in any way, shape or form?<br />
<br />
The entire Azerite system is pretty bad, but this huge lack of flavor is definitely part of it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
have to completely agree...while it was somewhat tolerable in Legion (partly because it was &quot;new&quot;) the system leaves me completely cold and numb as a player. It's not particularly alt friendly either. AP and a few of the other experiments in BFA (warfronts etc) drained all the enthusiasm I had left for the game.<br />
<br />
I levelled one toon to max in BFA and simply couldn't be bothered to chase that particular carrot for the entirety of another expansion.<br />
<br />
Saying that they &quot;learned&quot; they have to rework the AP system is missing the point. They have to remove it, period. Reworking it is the equivalent of turning Garrisons into mission tables without resource rewards / buildings for a 2nd consecutive expansion. I don't want to ever click another mission table again or have the core character progression tied to an AP type of grind. <br />
<br />
Waiting for Classic and its admittedly flawed but still much more enjoyable reward mechanisms and play experience to re-sub.</div></div><hr />

I agree, however all of this was addressed by beta testers (like me) prior to BFA. I myself specifically reported that the necklace alone would be fine if they want to continue the AP grind, but the tying of the necklace to other gear was an unnecessary and confusing addition; guess what they are now reverting to doing? I also reported during beta that the culling of abilities went too far and rotations have become stale on every class, but again they didn't listen. So, they've been told by the fans time and time again but they simply refuse to listen (or, perhaps, have an inability to decipher good feedback from whining).<br />
<br />
I suppose because it's too generic? I mean &quot;on every class&quot; does sound like whining. I don't find my current class and spec stale. Would prefer no GCD on one of my abilities, but aside from that it's pretty fun.<br />
But even if it was good feedback, one drop of water in a sea... I mean everyone has to report the same thing, not just a handful of people. Also, are you from the US or EU? It often seem (&quot;seems&quot; being the key word) that EU feedback isn't considered as important.</div></div><hr />

Wait, you mean some random bs item I got from spamming a quest ability in a basement with a dwarf was not as significant to me as receiving a piece of Frostmourne, a sword that has literally forged the past of Azeroth on multiple continents?
