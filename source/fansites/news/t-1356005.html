Battle.Net Launcher Update<br />

Elite PvP Gear<br />
.Is it permanently or temporary because of the conquest cap bug at the start of this season. <br />
The elite set only providing armor is permanent, although there is nothing to say this won't change in future seasons. The Elite Grievous gear is only giving armor because it's designed as a transmog set, rather than gear you would need to spend gold to enchant and gem again. It's also not intended to provide better stats than the normal set, it's meant to make your gear different and more identifiable to signify the prestige of your accomplishment. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/273372-elite-gear/) / Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/8324982818?page=1#5))<br />
<br />
Burden of Eternity Rarity<br />
We like the extra rarity that comes from requiring multiple Burdens to get perfectly-itemized 535 gear. The gear is very good, so we don't want it to be too easy to get a hold of the best possible pieces. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/273366-timeless-isle-gear-and-use-of-burdens/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/10137434201?page=1#20))<br />

Cross-Realm Looking For Group<br />
Why can't you guys at blizzard just implement a dedicated LFG crossrealm browsing/listing system?<br />
That is definitely a good idea but like always, it’s mostly a matter of time and resources vs current needs.<br />
<br />
Many of the ideas from some of the top addons have in the past been integrated into the default game UI. <br />
I agree that this would be a great tool to have but I also believe that this is nothing new to the devs. I’m pretty sure they are quite aware about the current needs for such a tool, especially now that we have such flexibility with all the cross-realm functionalities.<br />
<br />
The raid browser, for example, was an early attempt at tackling this. It worked out somewhat ok initially but subsequent iterations weren’t as successful. I suspect the reasons for this were the introduction of LFR and not having a dedicated button on the main interface (a lot of players still don’t know about its existence). (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/273327-timeless-isle-ruined-pandaria/) / Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/8325342684?page=2#29))<br />
<br />
Legendary Quest Items<br />
It's only 1 attempt per boss per week across all difficulties. <br />
<br />
If you already completed Siege of Orgrimmar wings 1 and 2 for Secrets of the Empire (http://www.wowdb.com/items/94593-secrets-of-the-empire) they won't drop a Titan Runestone (http://www.wowdb.com/items/94594-titan-runestone). If you haven't completed Throne of Thunder wings 3 and 4 though, you can run that with Lei Shen being a 100% guaranteed drop..<br />
<br />
As a side note, only the first 8 bosses in SoO have a chance (Sha of Pride is 100% guaranteed just like Lei Shen) to drop items for Wrathion's legendary quest line.

Flex Raiding<br />
How is personal loot and loot being distributed between 10/25 players even close to being the same thing?<br />
The point is that neither system is intended to have no waste, which is what seemingly was being requested. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/383010414730043392))<br />
<br />
Now I'm confused. I thought flex was targeted at a different demography from LFR, normal and heroic? Running both = burnout.<br />
My point was it gives you something to graduate to. Normal guilds graduating to heroic has been a thing since we launched heroic. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/382246930081787904))<br />
<br />
Reputation / Questing<br />
Really think questing/endgame/rep need to go backward a bit. Wrath is by far the fav WoW Expac in all polls. Maybe look why?<br />
We find it's hard to extricate the story and world from the gameplay even in people's minds. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/382245059485122560))<br />
For example, I love Northrend as a place and all of the various story arcs. I've always been a nerubian fan. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/382245161608028160))<br />
But would the LK rep grind or dungeon grind transposed to Pandaria turn it into another Wrath of the LK? Not convinced of that. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/382245594359533568))<br />

Yeah my guess is RAF if the jpg is called AmountforFriends.jpg..<br />
<br />
Except it's showcasing two friends on the mount, so my second guess is instead of a 2 seater mount, both accounts now get the mount with RAF instead of the main account, but who knows!</div></div><hr />

In the blue post it says:<br />
<br />
As a side note, only the first 8 bosses in SoO have a chance (Sha of Fear is 100% guaranteed just like Lei Shen) to drop items for Wrathion's legendary quest line.<br />
<br />
Which means quest items (sigils) have a 100% chance to drop from Sha of Fear in TOES, just like Lei Shen has a 100% chance to drop secrets or tit stones.<br />

Even though Sha of Pride does not have a 100% chance to drop secrets or stones, as far as I know. No one has mentioned this before.<br />

<br />
Except it's showcasing two friends on the mount, so my second guess is instead of a 2 seater mount, both accounts now get the mount with RAF instead of the main account, but who knows!<br />
<br />
Except its mmo-champion who have named the photo that file name, the one on Facebook posted from blizzard has no such filename. So any conclusion you're getting from the filename is from guessing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
10man gets more mounts per person; 0.1 compared to 0.08. Also, 25man guilds usually have a bigger roster with respect to the raid size (12-13 compared to 30-35). Don't understand why you would think this favors 25 man when the opposite is actually true.<br />
<br />
It should be 2 + 50% chance to get a 3rd on 25man.</div></div><hr />

Yeah what's with this misinformation on the front page of a website like MMOChamp? <br />
<br />
It's like they're trying to discredit Stars of something?? They killed the boss with higher ilv yeah but the boss is harder than the Western server as well. Don't just give the information that will only discredit them like this... It's not very professional as a media website.</div></div><hr />

Except it's showcasing two friends on the mount, so my second guess is instead of a 2 seater mount, both accounts now get the mount with RAF instead of the main account, but who knows!<br />
