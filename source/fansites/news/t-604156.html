&lt;a name=&quot;notes&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;1. Patch notes<br />
These notes are the official Test Realm notes modified with a few more details on spells changes, they will be updated if the patch deployed on live servers is more recent than the latest PTR build. <br />
General<br />
Boat and zeppelin vendors and NPCs are are back on duty.<br />
Reduced network latency by disabling the Nagle algorithm.<br />
/timetest is a command that can be run to provide information on game performance. /timetest 0 turns the command off. When the command is issued, the next time a player uses a flight master to travel, certain statistics will be measured and displayed at the end of that flight. All weather effects and spawns are shutdown during the test.<br />
Effects triggered from being critically hit: Many abilities and talents were changed in 2.3.0 to allow them to trigger from critical strikes that occurred while the player benefitting from them was sitting.<br />
Quest givers with blue question marks no longer show up on the minimap.<br />
NPC's who you have completed a quest for will display a question mark on mouseover rather than an exclamation point.<br />
The bank controls for the guildmaster level of a guild is now grayed out. A guildmaster always has full access to a guild bank and this cannot be changed.<br />
A &quot;Withdraw-Repair Only&quot; button has been added to the guild bank controls. If this is set for a guild rank, then that rank cannot actually withdraw funds from the guild bank, but they can still use that daily amount of money for repairs.<br />
You will now automatically stand up when attacked, even if the attack doesn’t land.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

Quote from Blizzard Poster Nethaera:<br />
<br />
I think you're getting a bit ahead of yourself here. We are still looking at AV carefully. Sometimes we don't implement something in one patch due to technical issues we've run into. Sometimes we decide they are better implemented at a different time. The most I can say at this point in time is that while the Warmaster change isn't in this patch, it may yet be implemented later.<br />
<br />
We are still working toward making AV a better and more strategic experience as we go along. I understand that you feel it is lacking (and others have voiced those same feelings) but there are others that also greatly enjoy AV in its current incarnation. We're not saying it's perfect. I've said this before in fact, but I'll say it again now, we don't generally settle for believing something is perfect &quot;as is&quot;. We are always looking for ways to make things better, more fun, and evolving the game to new levels. We are not satisfied easily and will continue to strive toward doing better.</div></div><hr />

# Reduced network latency by disabling the Nagle algorithm.<br />
<br />
Would anyone know, now that this fix has been implemented should I reverse BOTH, ONE or NONE of the latency fixes previous posted on this site about 4 pages back on December 17, 2007?<br />
<br />
(old discussion thread here: http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=3031.0 )<br />
<br />
One is entitled &quot;1 - TcpAckFrequency&quot; and the other &quot;2 - TCPNoDelay&quot;<br />
<br />
Based on my non-technical read of it, it appears both registry changes are no longer required... is that correct? Or is only one of the 2 fixed?<br />
<br />
Finally, there's a seperate thread about opening windows media player before loading wow to increase load speeds on www.worldofraids.com . (I know it sounds crazy but it works). Has the patch made that unnecessary as well?<br />
<br />
