Developers’ note: We like fun holiday buffs adding flavor to the game and we don’t want to prevent them from being used in raids and dungeons. We also don’t like unusable items taking up inventory space the rest of the year. We expect to make future holiday buff items follow the same pattern.<br />

<br />
So it follows the same rules like literally everythin else, not to mention its now more forgivin at lower keystones levels where newer people who might not be aware of that strategy still can get hit by that canon.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah. Anyone. Talk about being dramatic. <br />
<br />
&quot;Nerf the shit out of&quot; You realize that the majority of guilds that have killed M Ghuun once, haven't even bothered to do it again, right? You realize that there's several reasons for that? I'm certainly not going to whine because I got CE before the nerfs and other people got it after. Hell, ours killed it once and then we couldn't kill it once 3 weeks later because we wiped at 1% repeatedly.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Nerfs are important for the game. Guilds that are farming get to do it easier. Guilds that are still progressing and feel like they are stuck get a little extra push to get over the hump and boost morale. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
If you honestly care about people getting CE as the 1400th guild in the world, you have serious problems.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
I know, but I think this is wrong because Mythic raiders would argue (aside from top 100, I'm talking about the rest of Mythic raiders) about &quot;well you got 8/8 M but at the end of the patch, so easy mode&quot; and something like that. On the other side, people who got no time at the start of the raid could feel sorry about not being able to clear Mythic before the big next-patch-incoming nerfs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For Uldir you certainly wants to go with BoP - Blur for BiS setup. While you can do well with WFI for sure, why would you pick it over Blur?<br />
<br />
For M+, WFI is the way to go yes, but in dungeons it's even more unlikely to have more than 1 surv hunter.</div></div><hr />

<br />
you would pick it over blur because almost every fight has more than one target so the talent works very fine as I said in your quote... Both options are competitive and answer for different needs both in dungeons and raids. I don't why you try to push birds of prey so much, they've done great balancing for survival, there's no need to push toward a specific build for every situation.</div></div><hr />
