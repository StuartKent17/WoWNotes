Battlegrounds Developer Focus Test<br />
Attention, Cataclysm beta testers! Want your shot at camping developers at the graveyard? This Thursday, November 11 beginning at 4 p.m. PST, we'll be holding a focus test for Rated Battlegrounds on the World of Warcraft: Cataclysm beta realms. If you want to participate, all you have to do is form a raid group with nine other players and queue for Rated Battlegrounds. We'll be conducting this test in a 10- vs. 10-player setting using Warsong Gulch, Twin Peaks, and Battle for Gilneas as the locations, so be prepared for some sweet, sweet ownage. We're hoping to receive lots of feedback about Rated Battlegrounds, Twin Peaks, and Battle for Gilneas, so be sure to visit our official beta forums. You could be up against a team of developers in any given match, so be sure not to go easy on your opponents, especially if you see names like Mumper and Kalgan!<br />
<br />
Lastly, be sure to keep the PvP momentum up by testing the new system. We want to make our new Rated Battlegrounds the best they can be! <br />
<br />

Recruit-a-Friend and Worgens/Goblins leveling<br />
New goblin and worgen characters will indeed be eligible for Recruit-A-Friend benefits including increased experience gain and grantable levels. As we've no current plans to modify the Recruit-A-Friend program at this time or increase the level range for which the benefits apply, goblin and worgen characters (as with all other characters) will only be able to receive the in-game bonuses up to level 60.<br />
<br />
So, to answer your questions directly:<br />
Would the 300% xp bonus work till 60? <br />
Yes. <br />
<br />
Would the Level Granting work till 60? <br />
Yes.<br />
<br />
This is, of course, bearing that all requirements for those benefits are met. :)<br />
<br />
Please keep in mind, as well, that there will be no Realm First achievements associated with leveling characters of a specific race, so this will not place goblin or worgen characters at any sort of unique advantage. <br />
<br />
Any plans on bumping when the 300% exp gets cut off? 60 levels out of 85 is absurdly low.<br />
Nope. No plans at this time. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/129114/will-raf-work-with-worgen-goblins))<br />
<br />
Removed reputations and achievements<br />
While players will be unable to increase their reputation with the Zandalar Tribe following the shattering of the world, the reputation itself will still exist and count towards various &quot;Raise X reputations to Exalted&quot; achievements*.<br />
<br />
This means that if you currently have 39 reputations at Exalted -- including the Zandalar Tribe -- and show this number on your Achievement tracker, you will still have 39 reputations at Exalted (and be credited for them) in Cataclysm. You'll also retain credit for any related achievements you've already earned. :)<br />
<br />
* This includes both character and guild achievements. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/127419/zandalar-tride-rep-and-the-55-rep-achieve))<br />
<br />
Razzashi Hatchling companion pet<br />
If you currently have the Razzashi Hatchling item in your inventory, you'll still be able to learn the pet spell at a later point in time. It's not like the pet is disappearing completely; it's just no longer dropping from its usual home in Zul'Gurub.<br />
<br />
In fact, I can confirm that the Razzashi Hatchling, being a clever and resilient little reptile, has already found a new home, and will be migrating there shortly after the shattering.<br />
<br />
[...] When we made the original announcement last month that certain pets and mounts would be removed, it was to inform players of changes that could potentially impact their gameplay. We know that there are many avid collectors out there and, whenever possible, we want to give players notice when a favorite item might be removed. In that same announcement, we also clarified that, while we didn't have any current plans to re-introduce the specified pets and mounts, if we happened to find a suitable location to add them back in, we would certainly consider it.<br />
<br />
Totally reasonable, right?<br />
<br />
Since then, we found an appropriate place for the Razzashi Hatchling, and it felt like a good opportunity to restore a pet beloved by so many. Naturally, we were excited to share this information with all of you, as we knew a lot of players were saddened to hear about the little guy's initial departure. There was no malicious intent, no crazy conspiracy behind this decision. We saw an opportunity to make the game more enjoyable that meshed with our design goals, and we went with it. Simple as that.<br />
<br />
In the end, the worth of the Razzashi Hatchling isn't solely measured in gold, and it would be a fallacy to think that we create non-combat pets simply to provide players with something to sell on the Auction House for profit. To many, pets like the Razzashi Hatchling represent something fun and exciting, and that's just as valid a currency as any in World of Warcraft.<br />
<br />
While I'm sorry you're at a financial disadvantage now, I'm hoping you're still be able to enjoy the pet for what it is (re: an adorable, head-bobbing reptilian sidekick) -- or, given that it will still be a rare pet, perhaps even find someone who will adopt it for a reasonable price. Good luck. :) (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/129029/is-the-razzashi-hatchling-item-to-be-removed))<br />
<br />
Class mounts in Cataclysm<br />
The class-specific mount quests will no longer be available following The Shattering; however, the mounts themselves can still be learned from class trainers. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/128393/class-specific-quests))<br />
<br />
Classes<br />
Rated Battlegrounds abilities restrictions<br />
We know about this issue and plan to have it corrected in time for launch. All class abilities will work as normal in rated battlegrounds. Consumables and engineering items will still be restricted, just like arenas. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/129028/first-mistake-on-rated-bg))<br />
<br />
Vengeance in PvP<br />
If a couple of people are beating on a tank, Vengeance isn't likely to stack very high. You need to take damage that is a big chunk of your whole health pool, which typically only bosses are available to provide.<br />
<br />
Now if you have several folks beating on a tank flag carrier, then Vengeance may stack up, but once you have several people, you almost certainly have a way to dispel the Vengeance or just CC the tank.<br />
<br />
If Vengeance ever gets to be a problem in PvP, we'll just remove it, plain and simple. The mechanic is only there to help with raid gear scaling, not to give tanks a fun toy for PvP.<br />
<br />
Thank you. Please do not let Prot specs get out of control again.<br />
We're hoping that Rated BGs give Prot specs a useful role similar to tanking in defending towers, carrying flags, etc. A tank in an Arena needs to have a lot of control and damage just like everyone else to be competitive, which coupled with their inherent survivability and resistance to being controlled got us into trouble.

Diseaseless Blood<br />
A lot of the concerns about diseaseless Blood play make a few assumptions:<br />
<br />
-- Someone else is providing the tanking debuffs (presumably without a major dps hit).<br />
-- You can AE tank fine without diseases.<br />
-- You won't use Outbreak.<br />
-- Your threat generation will be fine without diseases (or at least the trade off will be worth it).<br />
<br />
Those are all risks, but I don't think there is enough evidence yet how they will all play out at 85. We're still a long way from the diseaseless dps rotations of yore. If they do all turn out to be true, to the extent that skipping diseases becomes the typical way that tanking DKs play, then we're likely to do something. Something could include giving Heart Strike or Death Strike slightly more dependent on diseases.<br />
<br />
Recall however that we changed things to their current state because too much ramp up time for a tank can be really painful. You don't want to have to get all your diseases up before you start generating decent threat, and when DKs are balanced around so much self-healing, you can't be expected to always have time to get diseases up when you really need that Death Strike heal. Perhaps there is room to come down a little. We'll see how things play out. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/127075/blood-tanking-instructions))<br />

Leader of the Pack<br />
Leader of the Pack now causes you to heal for 4% of your total health and gain 4% of your maximum mana. Down from 8%.<br />
This seems to be a tooltip bug. The actual Leader of the Pack (internally) says 4% of health and 8% of mana. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/128410/feral-mana-issues-ahoy))<br />

Kill Command<br />
We made a couple of fixes to make Kill Command more usable. The pet will no longer check for range or facing since there is already a check in place when the hunter tries to use the ability. This should make Kill Command feel less laggy and should never burn the cooldown or Focus without executing the attack. See how it feels in the next beta or PTR build.

Seal of Truth &quot;nerf&quot;<br />
The most recent Seal of Truth change was just a tooltip correction. The numbers did not go down. We did nerf Censure and raise Exorcism in a previous build, but that should not be new information. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/128839/ret-nerfed-again))<br />

How come blind has such a long cooldown?<br />
While the effects of Blind will interrupt on damage, the ability itself is neither a disease nor can it be dispelled. (Perhaps you're recalling how, at one point in time, Blind was classified as a poison effect?)<br />
<br />
Regardless, one of the great strengths of Blind is that it can be used instantly while under pressure. You can use it to neutralize an attacker, to interrupt a healer who would otherwise save your target's life, or to stop an escaping victim in his or her tracks; the list goes on. The three-minute cooldown on Blind helps mitigate its potency and versatility just enough to ensure that the ability isn't spammed or otherwise abused.<br />
<br />
Overall, though, between Gouge, Blind, Sap, and other stuns, we feel that rogues currently have very strong CC in both PvE and PvP environments. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/128239/how-come-blind-has-such-a-long-cooldown))<br />

Grass is always greener... sure orcs and trolls have racials who's benefit can be modeled and simulated, there are plenty of alliance racials that are just as useful, being able to cheese boss mechanics with an always on PvP trinket or escape artist, getting +expertise on a few types of weapons, I can't tell you how many times a Gift of the Naaru has saved me on my mage. Cheesing people with Shadowmeld on my druid and rogue? Yeah... if Dark Flight wasn't balanced for all the classes it was available to, then trust Blizzard, if they made it completely useless they will fix it. <br />
<br />
And I doubt: http://www.wowhead.com/spell=20550 is going to give you 5,000 hit points @ level 85, unless we're all going to have 100,000 hit points naked.</div></div><hr />

You are correct that art is subjective, BUT I myself have seen AT LEAST (being serious) 1000 people (think of people who don't even voice opinion) saying it doesn't look like the classic sets that made them want to bang their heads against a wall for months to obtain.

I'm fairly disappointed in many of the tier sets. They can put a really fancy glow on a piece of trash, but it's still a piece of trash (referring to pally set).

<br />
the fuck man, the fuck ?<br />
<br />
I was wondering the same thing. The double nerf is unnecessary and completely based around a sub pvp build. It is not OP in the other two trees nor is it OP leveling up due to much lower relational health pools. Gaining 20% of your HP over 30s at the cost of 5 CPs is hardly worth it. Having the current 30% makes it a much more usable option. They should have just removed the mastery component then evaluated the effects of the ability instead of blasting it into oblivion. I don't even know why the mastery affected it in the first place as the assumed benefit of an ability named &quot;executioner&quot; should only affect damage increasing effects, not healing effects.</div></div><hr />

Another 70% speed boost to stack on top of all of that? Hell, even the 40% boost is borderline unfair.

<br />
I couldn't disagree with you more. Although the DK one looks better in normal/blue, the earthy browns and goldsand greens suit a druid much more than the blue and purple of the normal version. The hunter looks good in both, though the normal/green looks a bit more like he made it himself from what he found in the forest. The mage one looks MUCH more awesome in flaming red, the paladin one looks MUCH more paladin-like in white and gold than it does in frikkin Icecrown blue, the priest sets are equally un-priesty tbh, and I think the rogue sets are equally un-roguey with those bright magical glowing shoulders. The red and brown shaman heroic is much more shaman-like than the fel green of the normal one, which looks like it should belong to a warlock. The red heroic warlock one is nicer to look at than the weird olive/teal green normal one, and the warrior ones are equally nice, though they look too much like they're made out of scales, than plate.<br />
<br />
But that's just my opinion, based on colours and styles looking like they should match the class in a lore sense.</div></div><hr />

You mean like this new version of Darkflight being the same speed as Druid travelform and Shaman Ghostwolf (don't rememeber if worgen could be shamans though).<br />
They should keep it somewhere in between sprint/dash and other classes movement increases.</div></div><hr />

Wish they'd quit giving us priests purple tier sets. They just don't look priestly. I was soo happy when I finally got out of the 264 t10 into the 277 light blue/silvery one. Now I have to go back to purple again :(</div></div><hr />

I think this may be one of the worst and ugliest sets. Paladin and Mage Tier don't look awful, though they are not nice, and I can say Warlock or Warrior, or even Priest (!) Tiers are not SO bad (well red warrior tier looks nicer), but... Druid, Hunter, Shaman Tier are AWFUL. Rogue and DK tiers are not as bad as these I said before, though they don't look nice at all, I think rogue pieces don't fit each other, and there is some trouble with colours...<br />
<br />
I'd like to say lock Tier is weird, you guys may think it is really ugly [sometimes I think it is awful, and then I think it's not so bad]... However, I think it fits a warlock really well.<br />

Gladly, I have a paladin. Unfortunately, I have a hunter too... And they are my mains [yes, I don't have a main, and an alter, I have two mains ;)]<br />

Go back to the regular wow and bc styles. They are still the best.<br />

I think they should install a paint shop. So we can change the colors of our gear or the style of what it looks like. <br />
For instance, Taking the Teir 4 style and making it T11 quality. I mean we got barber shops.. WOOO wowo, that was so worth the time. ( sarcasm )<br />

<br />
I'm really not very impressed with these/wrath's sets at all compared to vanilla/TBC sets, and I don't really think it's due to the rose-tinted goggles of nostalgia, either. I think tier sets these days look way too homogenized, especially texture-wise, and the color schemes seem WAY too similar across the board. It really became clear to me when looking at them all next to each other for once just how boring they look side by side. Sets like Judgment and Plagueheart had SO much more character; they stood out and really identified a class like tier sets should, even if some people thought they looked a little goofy. I understand that it has to be difficult coming up with so many tier sets, especially after this many years, but it doesn't seem like they're even trying anymore. <br />
<br />

Also, @ Darkflight nerf:<br />

They over nerf rogue recuperate. I think it should still work with mastery. DKs and warrior have 25 000 more hp than rogues in 352 ilvl pvp gear. I thought every classes were supposed to be close to each other. Rogues has 109k hp when a DK or warrior has 136k with the same ilvl gear. So when a dk use his % healing abilities its a lot more then a rogue.</div></div><hr />

AoE stuns fine ... AoE silences, fine ... Tauren racial giving an extra 5k health at lvl 85 fine ... Orc and troll racials being far and away the best PvE damage racials for pretty much every class ... fine, Every man for himself ... given a 3 minute cooldown making it basically useless, Worgen sprint now gains you as much distance as the goblin rocket jump except it takes a lot longer to do the movement and you don't get a quite strong mini nuke you can use as an alternative.<br />

<br />
Deathknights look like they ate Ragnaros, then decided to put on his armor for giggles...<br />
<br />
Druids look like they skinned their flight forms, then thought wearing it would hide the fact....<br />
<br />
Hunters clearly pissed off the Devilsaur in Un'Goro Crater and somehow managed to kill it from the inside out, but can't seem to take the bones off.<br />
<br />
Mages got incinerated by Deathwing and look very similar in styling to Bolvar Fordragon, which is cool, don't get me wrong, but my mage is already undead; she doesn't need another skull on top of her own. The heroic version does look pretty badass though.<br />
<br />
Paladins... look like they were so happy to finally be able to get the Ravenlord mount without the help of a druid that they decided to model their armor after him. Ah, to be a mighty morphing pally ranger... I honestly think I preferred the 'Fighting Japanese Robot' suit...<br />
<br />
Priests actually look kinda cool; Just like how paladins stepped out of AQ for their Tier 9 set, priests apparently went back for a revisit for tier 11. I like the snake/egypt colouring scheme for the non-heroic set, but the little braziers that have either water or holy power flowing out of them.. a little odd. And the heroic version doesn't quite suit the rest of it either.<br />
<br />
I'm really hoping that the rogue set shown here is not the final version, or that there is an issue somewhere.. because the blue flame really doesn't match the rest of the outfit, which looks basically the exact same as most of the leather gear that's kicking around now anyway. The heroic version looks almost the same as my hunter's tier 10.<br />
<br />
Shamans look very earthy... which is odd, in a way. They've typically had the coolest armor out of all the classes, but aside from the wicked green glow around their shoulders and thighs, they're kind of... blah. Since Ulduar, they also seem to enjoy putting dangly things on shaman gear; now don't get me wrong, I enjoy the dangly things but really, I think I have a skirt with a similar style that is a level 21 item?<br />
<br />
Warlocks... look like they stole the rogue tier 10 set, mashed it together with the warlock tier 6, and this was the end result.. Maybe it will look cooler in-game? Looks pretty tame for a warlock to me, after the crazy styles they've had lately.<br />
<br />
Warriors stole the mage tier 2 and combined it with their own tier 2 set, plus a little extra hunter sexiness. &quot;Oh look, mage got to have shiny turquoise crystals all over? WE WANT THAT TOO! But wait! We need to look more threatening... I know! Let's attach the crystals to plate gear! And then wear an awesome scale-type under armor like hunters. Dude, we'll look so pro!&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
So they should nerf it for everyone just because it's really good for certain classes? If that's the case then they should do that for belf silence, warstomp and half the other horde racials.<br />
<br />
A 40% sprint on a 3 min cd is crap. There are already abilities that give that much run speed indefinitely. Any sprint-like cd ability needs to be at least 50% or more or it's terrible. Using a cooldown for such a minor speed increase is retarded.<br />
<br />
I love seeing all the horde try and justify how their racials aren't that great and ally actually have good ones. Quit trying to twist the truth. The horde have the best racials. Blizz is biased. You play ez mode. Get over it.</div></div><hr />

They could easily buff it back up to 70% and just have it share the CD with Sprint and Dash. Or, they could keep it at 40% but roughly double the duration, making it far more useful.<br />
<br />
Seriously, is it necessary to nerf it that hard? I'm not asking for an early travel form or mount, but just throw us a bone (yuk yuk yuk). A 40% buff for, say, 20 seconds would be IMMENSELY useful for questing and in-combat escapes. It wouldn't necessarily be an early travel form or mount, but it would go far enough that it would be useful.<br />
<br />
Or you could just have the joint cooldown only work in PvP combat. What about that?</div></div><hr />

You're crazy if you think even +40% for 10 seconds isn't plenty good for a racial. It still makes a huge difference for some classes (priests especially) and is still much better than most racials.<br />
<br />
+70% movement speed for 10 seconds as a racial was absolutely broken, and there's no arguing that fact. I for one am happy, because at least now BGs might not consist of 7+/18+ worgen<br />
sprinting around and being extremely annoying. In a BG, 3 minutes isn't all that long if you factor in travel/res times, which means you could pretty much expect to have Darkflight used against you at least every other time you encounter an enemy player/group of any class(assuming worgen.)<br />

It would have been beyond stupid if it had gone live as 70%.</div></div><hr />

As for the T11 sets, The whiny bitches that is the WoW community never changes. Hunters finally get a set that looks like you kill something and yall still whine about it. The Mages get a nice looking set, yet ppl still bitch it should be a Lock set. Undead makes the Hunter T11 look awesome even the warlock set looks good on the undead, ANY warlock set looks good on the undead for that matter. The Priest set is just beautiful on female BE/Humans/Draenei/NE. T11 Paladin looks great on both on the BE and Draenei. Now if you play a Male Human, a Dwarf, Male NE, or Gnome (with the exception of the caster set) Your going to make any set look ridiculous not matter what Blizz makes.</div></div><hr />

NONE of the gear makes you feel like you're playing that character. People play priest because they want to look and feel like a holy priest, not some god awful super detailed purple glowing blob. <br />
<br />
Design is absolutely visual and completely flexible, but it has to make sense. None of these or the past 4-5 tiers of gear make ANY sense at all.

The theme is ELEMENTALS from this tier. So we have air, earth, fire, shadow, water, and I think Life was left out. In that frame most look good. Except Hunter T11 that makes both males and females look like a crazy hobo.<br />
I kind of expected the exposed skin to be in female Warlocks and not Priests. That seem so out-of-character that Priests show their bellies and Warlocks don't.<br />
Finally, Burger King from Hell doesn't look so cool on females, opposed to druids that are better on females.</div></div><hr />

Er, yes, give me the PvP Season Masamune Date costume over this nonsense please. The Heroic Variant reminds me of the harlequin days of TBC with some of these misaligning colours across the board. (seriously, are Blizzard's designers colourblind or something? -.-?) The Undead make it look cool because half of it you can't bloody well see...Less clownish, or more so dependant on your preference I suppose.<br />
<br />
However, seeing as a few people are QQing, I might as well jump on the bandwagon and throw this as my last thought of the evening. Forgive me in advance for this wave of blasphamy.<br />
<br />
Dear Blizzard,<br />
I'm a life-long fan of the game and I'm sure I speak for us all when I say we appreciate the time and effort gone into forever improving our gameplay experience.<br />
However, I must directly inquire as to what on God's earth has made your design team develop such dire hard-ons for delivering utterly unsuitable designs for those of the non-plated light? Okay, Transendence was a LONG time ago, sure, and in hindsight the Faith gear wasn't so bad...But, lets be honest, the only things that have made us look even remotely 'priestly' have been the way-way-way-past-gone days of Prophecy, and the glorious hymn of hope that was the Absolution Tier. I will not have you say my Avatar set did not make me look like a god damn christmas fairy. <br />
<br />
And now, after the despair that you gave us - requiring us to work through re-skinned content, some mighty giant meteor shoulders, generic clothy packs and two levels of Tier with tea-lights for shoulders to FINALLY look something like our class should do...Clean, crisp lines of calm, light tones that turn somewhat menacing in Shadowform - whilst still being visible. You did good. Eventually.<br />
<br />
And then this appears. Tea lights for Serving dishes and yet more disasterous purple. And then I see Rogues with an impossible helm that glows brighter than quite a number of my own holy spells that, truely, would be anything but stealthy in practice. Druids are once again suffering with shoulders that look as though they could weigh down any mortal being - I have my sympathy for those formerly of the Tree variety. But you've done good in places. The Heroic Mage is suited to the content, and certainly in practice suited to them I suppose. The Warrior isn't too bad on both fronts either. Death Knights have rolled out with an appropriate set for the content and their nature, and I have to say it's likely tied for top spot with me.<br />
<br />
I'm not going to QQ over this much more, but Blizzard: Please, Please, PLEASE - remember that we have to stare at these for a long time, in the case of most players. One half of Tier 11 is pretty damn impressive, the other is lackluster and shows you have an unnerving fetish towards nonsense in the concept room (what, did you let Richard Knaak in or something?). The same can be said for half of the first Cataclysm Season. How about you fire the non-functioning halves and stitch them together to, perhaps by Tier 12, make a complete collection that at least &gt;50% of the community will enjoy...<br />
<br />
No?<br />
Fuck :/</div></div><hr />

AoE stuns fine ... AoE silences, fine ... Tauren racial giving an extra 5k health at lvl 85 fine ... Orc and troll racials being far and away the best PvE damage racials for pretty much every class ... fine, Every man for himself ... given a 3 minute cooldown making it basically useless, Worgen sprint now gains you as much distance as the goblin rocket jump except it takes a lot longer to do the movement and you don't get a quite strong mini nuke you can use as an alternative.<br />

If you pay some attention you will see that all &quot;bad&quot; sets on male chars looks much better on female.

To me it seems engineering is now the only profession you can't really take if you PVP and don't want to have disadvantage. The worst thing is that I really went to engineering to have cool extra tricks in PVP.<br />
<br />
I liked how it worked before. In BC you could have the rocket boots in arena and have a massive running speed bonus once per battle, but it meant you had to replace your epic boots with low lvl green boots and lose a ton of stats.<br />

No, they can't be shamans and playing a druid myself both on live and the beta I'm well aware that this nerf makes darkflight much less useful for druids, especially in the light of the fact that with the pvp set bonus both travel form and cat form give a more than 40% speed increase.<br />
But it still will be useful in bear form.</div></div><hr />

<br />
derp.<br />
<br />
i forgot no one uses CC or stuns in BGs, rofl.<br />
<br />
btw adding &quot;derp&quot; in your post doesn't make your terrible argument better</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also... DK's and Hunter's T11 sets look like shite.<br />
<br />
I agree towards the how underwhelming basically every Worgen racial is, and agree with Hunter's T11, but question:<br />
How can you possibly say that the DK T11 sets look bad? While the heroic looks unnecessarily Deathwing-like, they both still look freaking awesome.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Blizzard has to nerf rogues first and foremost before they can move onto the other classes, no matter how grossly overpowered they are. That's just how the system works.</div></div><hr />

<br />
IMO it needed a nerf.. Think about a worgen rogue with engineering.. (Could argue the goblins need one too, but there is a bit of a movement delay on goblin rocket jump.)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Unless you think all Tauren are going to have a base (naked and unbuffed before racial bonus) health of 100K, I think you should check your math.</div></div><hr />
