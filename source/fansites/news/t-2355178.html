<br />
I imagine so.<br />
<br />
Even though it's a minor patch I'm going to speculate here they want it to collide with 4.2 for FF14. They've done similar things before. <br />
<br />
Sure it sounds silly from what I'm saying but it's actually pretty smart. Me personally I'd play both games at that time. But 7.3.5 would probably garner some more interest towards WoW in that situation just as 4.2 would garner interest.</div></div><hr />

Aye the same i thought yesterday.... and the price of the wowtoken will rise into new dimensions<br />
<br />
And im sure 4 of the 6 allied races will come to 7.3.5 if you preorder the Addon. i think a fitting Epilog for Legion with this 4 races.</div></div><hr />

That's what I thought. 4 of 6 Allies are playable in 7.3.5 when you preorder BfA, Zandalari Trolls and Dark Iron Dwarves after the BfA launch.</div></div><hr />

This should mean that you could get the reputation on one character, the required quest achievement on another, and then start the questline on yet another character, regardless of faction or server, if you wished to do so.<br />
All Allied Races requirements listed above (Legion lore master/diplomat) are also part of Legion Pathfinder (required for flying on the Broken Isles), and they are account-wide. Or am I missing something?</div></div><hr />

I think you missed that you do also need Army of the Light/Argus Reach at Exalted as well. I think Highmountain/Suramar is way easier than getting those two to Exalted anyway.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yea I'm expecting the same. This is just the bricks being laid for pre order just because the codes and assets are there dosent mean it's gonna be active :/ <br />
<br />
Also the lua code from the race select screen for allied races shows you need bfa purchased so unless there gonna put pre order up befor beta I doubt we will get anything in 7.3.5 race related<br />

I play mainly Horde and am finished with quests and reputations there, but my Alliance alt for unlocking the Allied Races is only some quests into Argus and also lacks reputation there. Though I probably could be finished when the new races become availabe, I would rather have the option to skip all this because I already finished all requirements on a Horde character. I even got all 3 paragon mounts from there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
with your reasoning I could make the argument that everything in WoW should be given for free including rare loot<br />
<br />
I hope they keep the restriction because I for one don't want these &quot;allied races&quot; to become the dominant races in the WoW Population. It is already bad enough how tilted the distributions are.<br />
<br />
Now imagine a world where 90% of the Horde Characters are made up of Blood Elves and Nightborne and 90% of the Alliance characters are Humans, Night Elves and Void Elves.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Elves alone already make up 34% of the current population of player characters. FYI. It's crazy high. Maybe that's why they're adding new elf races, because people like to play them (and maybe the elf players will at least have some variety within their group since each side has 2 options now). But then again, I'm converting a non-elf to a void elf so it might result in an even higher elf population overall!! eek.</div></div><hr />

Yet all the other reps are literally tons easier to get to exalted. Oh wait, you think it is just to complete the questlines?!?! Typical Hordie, crying AND terrible reading comprehension.</div></div><hr />

As long as only one character has to have the achievement, then my Alliance main will have all four covered. But I don't like the idea of needing a 110 on a specific server. My Horde server character is only 100; kinda annoying to have to level to 110 just to restart another toon (not that it takes forever but still, annoying). Take advantage of the invasions while you can, since there is no hurry (you don't need these chars ready 3 days from now on), so even if it takes few weeks for invasions to occur when you're available to play, it's super easy semi-afk way. Loom up the char, park at a quest, queue your own group (so no one can kick you for afk) and let others do the work. Plenty of people do it. I did it myself. Now if I need invasion wq on my 110s I list a group so low levels can join, it's a way of paying it forward after levelling my chars. As long as you have legion flying it's not really a problem to get around broken isles.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also the lua code from the race select screen for allied races shows you need bfa purchased so unless there gonna put pre order up befor beta I doubt we will get anything in 7.3.5 race related<br />

Sounds like some one hasn't been doing there world quests this expansion.<br />
<br />
Sounds like you're ok with Blizzard literally punishing new players to the game, telling them that if they want to play the new races they just unlocked, they'll need to grind out irrelevant content. I'm not ok with that.</div></div><hr />

They said on Blizzcon they might remove this kind of requirements later on when the reps are old and obsolete, but they did mention this kind of requirement. And no, new player won't have allied race unlocked, first he needs a lvl 110 char, then he needs to fulfill the rep / achievement criteria and only after you can start the quest to recruit them. <br />
<br />
The whole situation gives me the pathfinder vibe - some people just don't want to &quot;unlock&quot; stuff, they want it open right off the bat. I'm not sure which side is &quot;right&quot; here, because there are arguments for either. Some people want to spam the shit out of allied races while others dread the idea every second player encountered is gonna be a nightborne or a void elf. It's a situation where you can't satisfy both sides. <br />
<br />
<br />
Got a great idea, how bout we open shamans and druid classes to races that ARE NOT of the following<br />
<br />
- crippled by scoliosis<br />
- unable to fit through a doorway<br />
- leaves rabbit sized droppings That's one of the reasons why I play Alliance, we have mainstream female Night Elf Druid option and it's the most popular one so far. There is a bit of a shortage of variety in shaman and warlock races, but void elf warlocks are coming and with shaman you can invent something (I think most people go for female draenei or male dwarf). <br />
<br />
But I sure hope Blizzard does something about Troll and Tauren females now that Highmountain and Zandalari are coming... they have 4 face options, that's ridiculous! Most other races have at least double that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Since it's basically the biggest feature of BfA, I'm pretty sure they won't. <br />
They are just probably going to announce the rep gates behind unlocking all the allied races so people can have them ready for 8.0, when you're going to likely be able to play them if you pre-order.<br />
<br />
They are going to &quot;entertain&quot; everyone with the scaling system for now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
BfA pre-purchase required for allied races (according to PTR strings) so I'm pretty sure they will include it in 7.3.5. Many people already have all the classes at 100 or 110 lvl, so they need something to level up ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not getting loot from bosses solo is really annoying.... stockades run can end up with anywhere between 0 - 3 blues. <br />
<br />
<br />
On live, it's 100% personal loot in eastern kingdoms dungeons, kalimdor still uses the &quot;old system&quot; in 7.3.2, but will have loot changed in 7.3.5 (new items/spec specific).<br />
<br />
Can't post on US forum with EU subscription :( Hope they take multiple reports in-game serious.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, they seem to be still adjusting things, greens seem to now cap out at 60 from a 60 dungeon, not 110 or whatever player level. But some greens also still drop at their &quot;old&quot; levels too. So things are inconsistent still.<br />
<br />
So I don't hope they rush/launch the patch in a current state unless their release build is different or have many hotfixes ready to go.</div></div><hr />

Totally. That's why they basically implement them right now - along with heritage set, mounts, hubs, scenarios, achievements, even Embassy where quests start is there. They doing it right now, but we won't be able to play it until October or whenever BfA launch. Fuck logic.<br />
<br />
Also, biggest feature? You assume people will ignore Kul Tiras, Zandalar, 120, Warfronts and Isles and go straight after Allied Races?</div></div><hr />

1. Resize unit frames, player frames, name plates, action bars and so on. <br />
2. Make player portrait 3D <br />
3. Make it possible to adjust the mini map and action bar location on the screen. <br />

I don’t wanna use Ellvui it takes forever to set things up. And I like orginal interface a lot. :)</div></div><hr />
