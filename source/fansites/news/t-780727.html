Ex-WoWWiki Admins Join Curse to Create Wowpedia<br />
You probably saw a couple of forum posts about it, most of the team behind WoWWiki left the website and created a new site: Wowpedia.org (http://www.wowpedia.org/). On a personal level, I'm glad that the team decided to pick Curse for this new project and I'm sure we have a great opportunity to build something really nice with that new site. <br />
<br />
From Curse.com (http://www.curse.com/articles/world-of-warcraft-news/857376.aspx)<br />
We're extremely excited to announce that the administrators and contributors previously from WoWWiki have now joined the Curse family of websites and have created a new wiki for World of Warcraft (http://www.wowpedia.org/Forum:Welcome_to_the_new_Wowpedia!), Wowpedia.org (http://www.wowpedia.org/).<br />
<br />
This free-to-use, community-driven wiki is the latest in our efforts to provide World of Warcraft players with premiere content and resources to help make your experiences better both in and out of the game.<br />
<br />
Wowpedia is already booming, but it will need the help of the community to continue to thrive. Head over and make it the best wiki for World of Warcraft (http://www.wowpedia.org/Portal:Main)!<br />
<br />
A few of the stats for Wowpedia, so far:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
More than 218,000 pages have been created, with over 84,000 content pages<br />
Over 72,000 users have registered to contribute to the wiki and its community<br />
15 administrators (http://www.wowpedia.org/Wowpedia:Administrators), all focused on building the premiere information resource for World of Warcraft<br />
330,000 visits since Wowpedia went live last week<br />
<br />
<br />
We're also pleased to announce that for the next two months, Wowpedia will operate completely ad-free. And while we'll need to have advertising on the website eventually to cover hosting fees, those ads will never be obtrusive or affect the flow of content on a page.<br />
<br />
As always, it's our goal here at Curse to provide gamers with the best possible tools, and the Wowpedia team is a great addition to the family.<br />

Cho'gall 25 Multi-PoV and Nefarian/Onyxia Sneak Peek Videos<br />
Paragon (http://www.paragon-wow.com/) released another video of Cho'gall 25, this one has multiple point of views and might give you a few more details on the fight! Also, the french guild Millenium (http://www.millenium.org/) managed to activate the first part of the Onyxia/Nefarian encounter in Blackwing Descent. Currently, you cannot finish the fight and Onyxia will be stuck at 1 HP. <br />

The Sunken Temple in Cataclysm<br />
If you watched/attended Blizzcon you probably heard that the size of the Sunken Temple/Temple of Atal'hakkar is greatly reduced now that the top portion of the instance is gone. Basically the only thing left is a quest NPC at the entrance, some trash, and 4 easily accessable bosses, more than enough to make your rerolls very happy to run the instance!<br />

&quot;Insane in the Membrane&quot; in Cataclysm<br />
Insane in the Membrane is a feat of strength, not an achievement. Feats are things that you can't be guaranteed to complete, which is why they're feats and not achievements. Most of them are actually now impossible to complete, and this feat will join a long list of &quot;you had to be there&quot; moments in WoW time.<br />
<br />
The feat isn't being removed of course, those who have it will retain it, however; some of the requirements are, so it will no longer be able to be completed by anyone who has not already done so.<br />
<br />
It's possible that in some very specific situations where someone has completed the reputations which are being removed, but not others that will still be in the game, that it can still be completed. But it's something we're waiting for clarity on, and will let you know as soon as we do.

Which is why Wikia forced the skin change on wowiki. It was a great change but the wowwiki crew whined about it and left. If you think Curse won't have adds throughout wowpedia after two months, you're delusional.</div></div><hr />

WoWWiki's ads were so bad they'd be in the middle of the content, screwing up the page layout.<br />
Wowwiki had ads? Well, I guess AdBlock did it's job flawlessly all these years.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Am I the only slightly annoyed that there are no new patch notes for what's being fixed and/or changed? And yeah, I hated the new layout for WoWWiki, so hopefully the new one will be better.<br />
Yeah. Probably Blizz had to pull those out, because there were major bugs in patch notes.</div></div><hr />

Shen'dralar for sure and it sounds like something to do with the bloodsail rep, but I'm not entirely sure. I'm half way through Shen'dralar which I can complete before Cata .

Shendralar Rep is going away, and you won't be able to restore Goblin rep with DM runs/librams will be taken out, too.<br />

True, but at the same time they could remove the faction and just have it so you can make the new cards and have the quests so you can still get the crappy low level rewards. I'm optimistic that they will keep it in for that very reason, but do have my doubts.</div></div><hr />

They forced the change so they could put MORE ads by having smaller layouts with smaller text, idiot.<br />
<br />
I and many others have abandoned Wowwiki as a result of their greedy actions and we are fully investing in Wowpedia, when users vote and the vote passes, the changes are not forced on us against our will, it defeats the very spirit of the Wiki resolution policies.</div></div><hr />

Make it simple:<br />
- For people who want to block ads (because they find them annoying as hell), they can.<br />

<br />
The Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported license, which all the content is licensed under, allow that. Furthermore, I'm not fully sure about the ownership of a wiki - Wikia administrate wowwiki as in provide servers etc and they own the domain name, but I don't think they can claim ownership of the content. From what I understand, a very large portion of the material on wowwiki is provided by 30-40 key contributors, and a vast majority of those are moving over to wowpedia.<br />
<br />
In fact, Wikia doesn't seem to have ANY control over the content - the news on the main page simply reads &quot;WoWWiki has moved! Please join us at our new site, Wowpedia&quot;. From what I can tell it isn't a copy-paste job either - all the history on the articles is intact, correctly attributed. Even the user database is moved. That quoted sentence seem to be a good description of what happened - the site isn't copied, it's moved.</div></div><hr />

WoWpedia doesn't have ads... but knowing Curse and seeing the nice ads on MMO-Champion, in the Curse addon client, etc... you can expect some annoying ads on WoWpedia soon.<br />

Wowpedia have not &quot;stolen&quot; anything as it's free to copy the content because of the license it's under, as long as they attribute the edits to their contributor(s) - which you can see that they have. If you've been around then you'd see the changes that Wikia is forcing on WoWWiki.<br />

Avatar of Hakkar fight was in the Sanctum of the Fallen God, you had to summon him so either theres something you have to click on in that room or the NPC at the start gives you something to do it.</div></div><hr />

Wikia forced a new skin on wowwiki that included five ad spots and pushed most of the pages content down about a screen. This has caused many of the admins and editors to abandon wowwiki/wikia. Wowwiki is still free to edit and use, but Wowpedia is the replacement since the admins will now have far more control over the ads and layout.

wowpedia and wowwiki have the EXACT same content today, and from the look of it wowpedia has a better chance of being the more updated site (and better layout) in three months time. It seems as most of those who wrote articles on wowwiki now writes on wowpedia. If wowwiki somehow attracts new contributors they can still be relevant, but with no administrators I doubt it. We will see. Worst case scenario, none of the sites stay up to date.<br />
<br />
From what I can tell &quot;wowwiki&quot;, as in founders and administrators and the defacto &quot;owners&quot; of the content, have used Wikia as a sort of server host. Wikia owns the domain name and the servers, but they do NOT own the content. They did not run the site, AFAIK. It's hard to talk about ownership of something that is free, hence the quotation marks around &quot;owners&quot;.</div></div><hr />

All Wikia articles are created under Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/) and thus are free to share, duplicate, and edit, so long as original credit is provided.<br />
<br />
More importantly, almost every single active contributor from WoWWiki has moved to Wowpedia, anyway.<br />
<br />
WoWWiki used to be independantly hosted, but moved to Wikia a few years ago, and in the process they gave ownership of the domain name to Wikia. Now Wikia is forcing changes that the creators and contributors of WoWWiki disagree with, so the community decided to find a new host, but Wikia refused to return / sell back the old WoWWiki.com domain. So they renamed it Wowpedia.org, which was decided to be the best available domain name.<br />
<br />
<br />
To put it more simply, WoWWiki is simply changing hosts from Wikia to Curse. They only changed the name because Wikia refused to sell them back the WoWWiki.com domain name.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Why not just update the WoWwiki site?<br />
Because Wikia, the host of WoWWiki, is forcing a new layout, new ads, blogs, mergers, and a variety of other changes that break many WoWWiki article layouts and in general muck everything up.<br />
<br />
In the coming weeks, you will no doubt see many wikia-hosted wikis move to other websites, because nobody is happy about the changes and the Wikia staff refuse to listen to feedback.</div></div><hr />

See, this is why I nicknamed this &quot;Suckin' Temple&quot;. 'Cause it does. I've been doing this instance for years. There really has never been anything fun about it.

<br />
Until you start donating large sums of money to the people that are gracious enough to provide these websites, deal with ads. A lot of you have literally no idea the work involved in maintaining these sites, and how much it costs to run a webserver with the traffic and bandwidth curse sites bring in. These are professional sites, not &quot;I've used Dreamweaver once, here let me use a table for layout elements and design you a shitty site from my 15 year old animated gif library&quot; sites that someone does as a hobby. These sites are jobs. Wiki sites are maintained by a bunch of contributors, but even so they're not small time websites to maintain.<br />
<br />
Stop complaining about ads, because without them you wouldn't have these hugely popular and informative sites you like so much. Because the vast majority of the sites users will not donate to help, so ads are necessary.</div></div><hr />

So you feel it would be a good thing for the publishers and paid administrators of this site to lose their jobs? I can understand an aversion to advertising, but not realising its necessity in allowing quality free content and entertainment, such as this site, is a tad naive.</div></div><hr />

It's not the skin (although it is butt ugly). It the way the skin was implemented. Wikia one day randomly decided to make this new skin mandatory on ALL of their wikis, not just WoWWiki, and deleted and/or ignored the overwhelming negative feedback it had gotten (including several reports of the skin causing eyestrain and migranes) and decided to shove it down the throats of all of their wikis. Claiming it would be too expensive to maintain two skins, Wikia is getting rid of the option to use Monaco (the former default skin) on November 3rd, making this eyesore of a skin mandatory for people using the site. Several wikis, not just WoWWiki, left over Wikia's disregard to their community. However, because WoWWiki is Wikia's cash cow, Wikia attempted to bribe them by offering them (and ONLY them) an increase on the skin size. Didn't work.<br />
<br />
tl;dr Wikia are acting like shitbags, WoWWiki moved because of it.</div></div><hr />

Same here, only difference between then and now is...I don't see the adds either. I might be more disposed to allow adds on certain sites (MMOC being one of them) if they were relevant. Adds about geek dating services, the one for women's purses...(that was one i saw here before i got add blocker)...yeah. Make them relevant and I might look at them.</div></div><hr />

WoWWiki's ads were so bad they'd be in the middle of the content, screwing up the page layout.<br />
<br />
Wasn't exactly their choice, but being part of the (at the time) Wiki network which imposed stupid things on them... The last stupid thing is what made all the admins decide to backup all their work and setup shop elsewhere.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You mean just like the white letters on black background on wowpedia? ;)<br />
<br />
The design between the two pages is almost identical - The difference is incredible small at best and once Curse starts to plaster the site with adds then it won't be any better than wowwiki at all - Judging by how things usually go when Curse acquires a new site, it will probably be even worse.<br />

If people lose their jobs because of lack of advertising revenue...so much the better.<br />
<br />
You get to keep that small-minded attitude until people no longer get a revenue from making TV programs, websites like mmo-champion etc. and then you start to whine like a little girl when you start to see your favorite things slowly disappearing around you cause you couldn't handle having a few adds showing on a website.<br />
<br />
Fact is that Curse and many of the other companies earn their living by having adds on their websites - If they didn't have that income they would either have to charge a membership fee(Which 99% of people would rather die than pay for) or stop providing websites that people love to use. It goes for Curse and most other content providers online.</div></div><hr />

<br />
See, ads are a funny thing really. Cookies track what your web browsing habits are, and then by using heuristics are able to determine what ads would attract your attention the most. Every so often, ads appear that do not apply, due to some fault of the tags the ad programmers embedded. However, a solid 90-95%+ of the time the ads apply some way based on your browsing habits.<br />
<br />
I can assure you that if someone took an in-depth look at your cookies, they could tell beyond a doubt what your likes/dislikes were along with your hobbies, gender and approximate age. In the end, the ads you were seeing appeared for a reason. Read that as you will.<br />
<br />
Also, I've a burning question. Seeing as though you are so vehemently opposed to entertainment-centred advertisements, I suppose you don't:<br />
a.) Attend sporting events of any kind<br />
b.) Purchase/read newspapers and magazines<br />
c.) View any movies<br />
d.) Drive with your eyes open<br />
e.) I could go on and on... but I think I made my point.<br />
<br />
P.S. I work in marketing &amp; graphic arts - you just told me that my job didn't count/matter. I'd love to know what you do for a living that gives you such a smug outlook on everyone's career choice.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah we have heard that one so many times before and fact is that you have clicked on adds and you have done so more than once - You might not do it often, but it still happens every once in a while.<br />
I've been using the internet for 15+ years myself and I'm also one of those &quot;i never click&quot;, but fact is that just once in a while it happens.<br />
<br />
But even if you don't click you actually generate revenue - Online advertising is not just paid by clicks, but also just by sheer exposure. That form of advertising is actually very popular with branding.</div></div><hr />

I do not wish to see any advertising in my entertainment, and therefore take steps to prevent that. If people lose their jobs because of lack of advertising revenue...so much the better.<br />
<br />
Maybe it's your company advertising, or maybe it's your company who runs the TV network and can't make anything good because of no ad revenue. <br />
<br />
Maybe it's your site that goes down because of lack of funding. Enjoy it while it lasts, before you have to pay to use anything you want to read on the internet or watch on TV.<br />
<br />
It has to come from somewhere, no-one does much for free, including presumably yourself. Or do you think that if enough people lose their jobs, they will rise up and take over the government and create an anarcho-communist society? In which case the word &quot;Russia&quot; might be unfamiliar to you.<br />
<br />
EDIT: I do have a premium Curse membership - for the update all function it's actually not that bad a price - but yeah, most of the reason the internet is so vast and content is mostly available for free is because of ads.<br />

Everyone from wowwiki moved to wowpedia because they were dissatisfied with wikia (their host).<br />
<br />
They wanted to keep the wowwiki domain, but wikia wouldn't sell it back.<br />

To put it simply, wowpedia is the new wowwiki.</div></div><hr />

Yeesh, you do understand those dungeons are out-leveled in hours right? They are leveling content now and those levels go by in hours today. (I personally know 3 people that leveled to 80 in 3 days played.) As one of the designers pointed out, they simply got rid of some of the suck in those zones.<br />

Whatever you say chief, I was taught long ago that banner ads are nothing but trouble and for the most part ive never seen a reason to disagree with that. I never click anything because Ive never seen anything worth clicking. If I want to buy something, then I know about it already, im not so weak minded that I rush out and buy everything that pops up on a flashy ad. They have these ads in these old fashioned things, they are called magazines, its like webpages, but on paper.. and they are just as useless now as they were on paper.</div></div><hr />

Maybe not, but i'm pretty sure they announced the old DM Librams being removed. So no more Dire Maul rep. Perhaps they'll add some new way to get rep there, who knows. So no-one new will be able to get that. <br />
<br />
They said, they're bringing in new cards for DMF, though. These new ones (hurricane deck, volcanic deck, etc) all give 350 rep each according to Wowhead. So, presumably they stay and you can still get rep if that's your last faction. <br />
<br />
But yeh, the Insane title is a feat of strength, and there's an expansion coming, so there's little use moaning that it's no longer possible to get, any more than complaining about being unable to get &quot;hand of adal&quot;, or the ZA bear.</div></div><hr />

Yup, Shendra'lar is being removed and bloodsail as well. You will still be able to gain rep with the Cartel, but will be unable to do the Free Knot quest in Dire Maul. Ravenholdt and DMF I believe are staying as of this moment. But anything can change.</div></div><hr />

Not the point. You shouldn't HAVE to go through extreme measures (any 3rd party solution is IMO extreme) to remove ads so they dont make your web-experience uncomfortable. <br />
<br />
So long as the Curse network keeps their promise to not have the ads included in wowpedia.org not be as disruptive (think google style ads) then it's a win in my book.</div></div><hr />

I do not wish to see any advertising in my entertainment, and therefore take steps to prevent that. If people lose their jobs because of lack of advertising revenue...so much the better.<br />

You do realize that those advertising checks pay for those lovely and fun things you do for entertainment, right? Otherwise you'd have to pay up front for those services.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Of all the streamlining and simplification of new and old content that has occurred since Wrath of the Lich King, this is the most disappointing and needless change Blizzard could have implemented. Sunken Temple was one of the only classic, labyrinthine style dungeons in the game. There was rich lore, a puzzle to solve (beyond just who to dps/crowd control in a trash pack), dragons, and you could actually get lost just exploring the place. It felt much more like a console or pen and paper RPG dungeon than any other in WoW. Try getting lost in a dungeon like Utgarde Pinnacle or Auchenai Crypts. It won't happen, because dungeon design has been almost exclusively linear since The Burning Crusade.<br />
<br />
I understand WoW has evolved into a very different game since vanilla, but consider the fact that Sunken Temple was always leveling content. Even more so, it was a niche, and entirely skippable even before The Burning Crusade was released. There was and is plenty of alternative content for players who couldn't be bothered to tackle a dungeon that required a little more time and challenged them in unique ways.<br />
<br />
So if people complained about Sunken Temple having too much trash, remove some trash. If you could progress through the statue/puzzle phase without the trash, it would have sped things up quite a bit. There are more effective ways Blizzard could have made Sunken Temple a less annoying, more casual friendly experience and stuck with the original design.</div></div><hr />
