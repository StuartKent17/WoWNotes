WoW Token Prices - Day 2<br />
WoW Tokens had their price update frequency changed back to one hour from 15 minutes after repeatedly dropping 1% every 15 minutes. The drop continued until late Wednesday night, when the price started to go back up.<br />

Changes to Conquest Catch-Up Cap<br />
Okay, we've tracked down the issue that caused some players to not get the increased Conquest catch-up cap.<br />
<br />
The good news is that the issue is only temporary, and any characters who did not get the increase this week will automatically get it with next week's reset. If you would like the increase applied sooner than that, please contact our Customer Service department, who will be able to manually correct it.<br />

Blue Tweets<br />
Game Design<br />
Coincidentally, if you have hopes of being in design, realize that you will be torn apart, your best intentions will fail. Be humble, learn. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/583504643738611713))<br />
re &quot;best intentions&quot; - immediately thought of Ashran...<br />
The best thing a community can do is tell the designer what the issue is directly, so they can learn, and the game can improve. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/583506296080441346))<br />
agreed. Re Ashran though you guys know everything already. Nothing new. It's been all said. It's great that you seek further input<br />
Important note: we're not a designer hive-mind. You may see &quot;mistakes&quot; repeated. It's important to compare/contrast. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/583510891708067840))<br />
Ashran - faction dominated, lacking clear and rather quick rewards. Spend an hour, get a few honor points, or just die constantly.<br />
world - not random enough. Nothing exciting and/or unpredictable to go out (or group) for. TLDR: rewards don't keep up with time.<br />
What do you want to gain after an hour? A month? (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/583515747973926913))<br />
<br />
Garrisons<br />
Battle pets! Why can't my followers also be avid pet battlers, and find me new, exotic cuties! Garona loves rabbits, fyi.<br />
Some players are hitting the cap, do you want more than one THOUSAND pets? (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/583516817877901312))<br />
<br />
Yo, what do you want to see as rewards to longer, harder missions in a future WoW patch? Gold, apexis, honor? (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/583515529328984064))<br />
why not both.. er, all three?<br />
How would this work for you? All 3 every week? A choice? Which would you choose? For how long? (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/583516391120080896))<br />
much longer missions with higher risk/rewards..<br />
What's the risk? % success? Follower death? What feels apropos currently? (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/583517006864912384))<br />
What happened to the follower &quot;recovery time&quot; element?<br />
It was really not fun, ultimately. Not to say it may *never* return, but wasn't for WoD launch. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/583519343519993856))<br />
But what about 3 day or 5 day missions with awesome rewards? makes for interesting choices..<br />
Dudes and dudettes, what is literally Amazeballs to you atm? (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/583518639724199936))<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lagmoose</div><div class="date">2015-04-09, 05:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the price of tokens will probably sit at around 20-21k for a while, perhaps going back upwards to about 25-26. Then there will be a lull in buying them until they go back down to around 20k-ish, only to go back up and then people will buy them up to drive the prices up. I know I've reactivated my account when they went live and today bought another token from the AH. I might buy another one before they get up real high again.<br />
<br />
I think it'll probably skyrocket with new content patches though. But hey, I'm enjoying this and even though I'm stingy with my gold, I'll drop gold for game time. :)</div></div><hr />

Don't waste your time replying to him. He got the exact same answer like 10 times in the notes yesterday. He obviously doesn't really care...<br />
<br />
No idea why it is that important to him tho. Seems a bit obsessed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah people are buying them up since they're cheap now, so the price will go up while there's mass buying. I'm guessing when the buying stalls down, the price will drop again.</div></div><hr />

Feels like there hasn't been any actual news in a bit now.<br />

Blizzard themselves could be buying tokens to keep the price up. Can't believe they would do it cause it directly influences the basics of supply and demand. And it also means Blizzard would be putting more gold into the game economy directly. But who knows... we know banks do it all the time. <br />
<br />
What I do know is that I can get 40K gold for 20$ on my server through 3rd party websites right now. Thats almost twice as much than what tokens are selling for. So I can understand if Blizzard is desperately trying to regain some control.<br />
<br />
Just sad to see a game turn into this. Exactly the same we saw with D3 when everything was turned into real life value rather than fun and ingame value. And it will get worse and worse. Blizzard will milk this and add more and more stuff that costs ingame gold to create more incentive for players to buy for real money.<br />
<br />
But atm they are giving 3rd party websites a great advertisement for those that are ready to buy gold for real life money.</div></div><hr />

It IS a win-win for players no matter if Blizzard gets money for it.<br />
They keep their income (a little more even), some players can get in game gold they always wanted, and others can pretty much play f2p. <br />
It's a win-win-win if that's is even a thing.</div></div><hr />

And to the People who advertise Gold selling. <br />
<br />
1. Gold selling often goes along with shady practices (hacking Accounts, botting, etc) - I wouldnt want to Support those. <br />
2. If you have a X Year old account and you want to run the risk of a permaban for some ingame Gold then I wouldnt call you exactly clever.

What's Blizz's alternative? Allow 3rd party websites to offer gold for money breaking the EULA? Of course not, this is a smart move by Blizz that positively offers gold for money whilst trading a commodity (game time) in the process.

Not a single person should be surprised that Blizzard gains something from this too. You pay 5$ extra for the option of gaining gold instead of using for a months playtime. And running the service itself isn't exactly free either.<br />
<br />
Seriously, did anyone think the tokens would cost like a months subscription and nothing more?</div></div><hr />

I seems that some people think, that Blizz is the Red Cross or something. YES they want to earn money with their product. YES they use every possibility to get money out of their product. Why shouldn't they do it? They aren't hurting the game with their &quot;extra money&quot;. Thats all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
this is very much different than the real money auction in D3 because in D3 RMAH you could retrieve said real money from the game. this is a very one direction system. If you really want to drone about how it makes it like D3 where in game gold has a real money value, it always has, just through 3rd party sites. <br />
<br />
Additionally, we have no reason to believe blizzard is generating gold to inject into the game as you speculate and suggest. That would be against their interest any ways of trying to control inflation a bit with all-ready existing gold sinks. This will move some gold into the active economy how ever, rather than just sitting in peoples inventories. <br />
<br />
Further, blizzard is actually late to the game on this type of system. Pretty much every other game that still has a sub, and even many F2P MMOs have similar systems that allow people to purchase all ready existing game services (think Sub fees, Premium content, character transfers, store mounts/skins, etc),but sell them to others for in game currency. It increases sales of these things for the developer as people who before wanted those things, but did not want to purchase them with real money, can now effectively use in game currency instead, and those who want gold can purchase the service and sell it to another player legitimately. it works out well for every one, and does not inject any additional currency into the game, nor does it allow for extraction of real money for said in game currency. In game currency can just effectively be used to purchase game related services, which are still purchased by some one (since in game currency has no real value to the developer)</div></div><hr />

I don't get why people keep saying this. Look, go to any gold buying site you want to. They will ask you what character they need to mail the gold to. Blizzard will not ban gold buyers because they can't prove that you're a gold buyer. Maybe I'm the crazy one, but I don't even look at where any of my mail comes from anymore. I tell my addon to open everything and delete anything it opened. I imagine most people do this. Just because you've suddenly opened up 300k worth of gold though may just mean you're being framed. <br />
<br />
Say I was in a race for realm first with another guild. I know who their two primary tanks are, I know without those two around, their progress is crippled. What's to stop me from going to a site, buying some gold and asking the site to send them to those tanks? Suddenly Blizzard declares them guilty and gives them a two week ban, stopping their dreams of getting realm first.<br />

I'm going to admit, I once bought gold from a 3rd party seller, and got caught with a warning.<br />
I learned my lesson and I haven't repeated that, but they DID see it, although the seller tried to be careful (I wouldn't say how due to obvious reasons)<br />
so yea they are definitely catching those players, and I'm sure they will punish them accordingly.</div></div><hr />

Why do you have to post such hyperbole?<br />
<br />
Do you really think it helps you get your point across?<br />
<br />
I mean you think there has been 15 months without content?<br />
<br />
Even if you don't include 6.1 (which btw had PLENTY OF CONTENT, just because its not content YOU want it is still content) it has been about 4 1/2 months.<br />
<br />
Loads and loads of people moaned and complained during 14 months of SoO that they released the initial patches to quickly so the solution is to even it out, anyway hey ho bitch and hyperbole as much as you want it really makes you look very clever.<br />

It's a fine move, and a choice many players welcome; the rest can leave it.<br />

The smart move is ofc to create a system that does not rely on gold to gain things to any serious degree. Instead you earn it by playing the game. Offer items, mounts and gear to the content. Create incentives for players to play the game and do different things. Blizzard is doing exactly the opposite in WOD and we all know why.<br />
<br />

I always wonderd what is it exactly that makes people sad seeing blizzard earning money. They didn't really put a gun to anyone's head and forced him to use the tokens..<br />
it's a really big win for the WoW community, Cutting gold-sellers income would make the game better over the long run, fewer botters, fewer account hacking etc..<br />
<br />
The big win for the WOW community is not to have 14+ months of nothingness during an expansion. Does this system create any incentive for Blizzard to change that? Nope - on the contrary. Now they can just add few things that cost gold instead and ppl will buy tokens to be able to afford it. And Blizzard will make more money for doing less. So why on earth should they bother to actually make new content ?<br />

I don't think the lack of flying has anything to do with people wanting to show off their land mounts. We don't have flying yet because Blizzard does not want us to have it yet (because it trivializes so much content the way Draenor is designed and they don't want us poking around Tanaar Jungle), not because other players don't want it.</div></div><hr />

It's a win-win-win if that's is even a thing.<br />
<br />
I look at it from this perspective. Why should I give another player my gold? Seriously, someone is buying a token and I am handing my gold over to them to make them even more rich in gold, which they probably don't even need at this point, since they have so much already. Also let's take it from the other side of the coin, the scumbag that simply refuses to go out and grind their own gold wants to sponge gold off of others, so they don't have to continue to grind out their own gold. Seem to me, Blizzard just reinforcing the whole care bear scenario they been conveying for more than two expansion already. I managed to have what I have in the game because I get off my own butt and do for myself, which affords me the opportunity to truly help others out because I have so much because I chose to not sit in Org or SW and complain that I have nothing to do, nor have I ever found a reason to ever beg for gold as many do each and every single day, because they are lazy. This token just keep them being lazy and sponge gold off people they don't deserve.</div></div><hr />

So much upset over fake money in a game. Who cares how much gold someone else has? Who cares how they obtained that gold in the game (as long as it isn't a result of buying gold from shady people who hack accounts)? I think it's great there is a legit way to basically buy gold. It doesn't make anyone lazy, and as someone who has extremely limited play time, if gives me an option to get gold if I choose to utilize it. Doesn't mean I'm lazy, it just means I would rather spend my time enjoying content than having to farm gold.</div></div><hr />
