Patch 4.0.6 Hotfixes - February 18<br />
Here you'll find a list of hotfixes that address various issues related to the recently released World of Warcraft: Cataclysm patch 4.0.6. Hotfixes are updates we make on our end without requiring you to download a new patch. Some of the hotfixes below will go live the moment they are implemented, while others may require your realm to be restarted to go into effect. Please keep in mind that some issues cannot be addressed without a client-side patch update. We will continue to update this thread in the days ahead as additional hotfixes are applied. Visit our Bug Report forum for a list of 4.0.6 known issues.<br />
<br />
February 18<br />
Battlegrounds<br />
<br />
Demolishers were respawning too quickly in Strand of the Ancients. They are now on a 20-second spawn timer.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ideathknights.gif Death Knight (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/269-Death-Knight) / Cataclysm Talent Calculator (http://www.wowtal.com/#k=..deathknight) / Skills/Talents (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/1116-Death-Knight-Cataclysm))<br />
<br />
Death knight Ghouls under the effects of Dark Transformation can no longer cast Gnaw while it's on cooldown.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ihunters.gif Hunter (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/271-Hunter) / Cataclysm Talent Calculator (http://www.wowtal.com/#k=..hunter) / Skills/Talents (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/1118-Hunter-Cataclysm))<br />
<br />
Aimed Shot damage has been decreased to approximately 160% weapon damage (at level 80+), down from 200%.<br />
Aspect of the Hawk now provides around an additional 2000 attack power at level 85.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ipaladins.gif Paladin (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/273-Paladin) / Cataclysm Talent Calculator (http://www.wowtal.com/#k=..paladin) / Skills/Talents (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/1670-Paladin-Cataclysm))<br />
<br />
Light of Dawn no longer heals targets outside the paladin's party or raid. It correctly heals up to 5 targets in the paladin's raid.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ipriests.gif Priest (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/274-Priest) / Cataclysm Talent Calculator (http://www.wowtal.com/#k=..priest) / Skills/Talents (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/1123-Priest-Cataclysm))<br />
<br />
Body and Soul no longer reduces the mana cost of Power Word: Shield (the hotfix made on February 16 to provide this additional benefit has been reverted).<br />
Rapture now returns 2/5/7% of maximum mana when Power Word: Shield is consumed, up from 2/4/6%.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/iwarlocks.gif Warlock (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/277-Warlock) / Cataclysm Talent Calculator (http://www.wowtal.com/#k=..warlock) / Skills/Talents (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/1125-Warlock-Cataclysm))<br />
<br />
Instant-cast Shadowbolts from Shadow Trance (both the talent and Glyph of Corruption versions) should no longer consume charges of Backdraft if both procs are available. Shadow Trance will always take priority and be consumed first when Backdraft is active. Subsequent Shadowbolts will consume Backdraft stacks.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/iwarriors.gif Warrior (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/278-Warrior) / Cataclysm Talent Calculator (http://www.wowtal.com/#k=..warrior) / Skills/Talents (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/1676-Warrior-Cataclysm))<br />
<br />
Two-Handed Weapon Specialization (Arms passive) now gives 20% bonus damage with two-handed weapons, up from 10%.<br />
<br />
<br />
Dungeon Finder<br />
<br />
If a party member remains outside of a dungeon for more than 3 minutes, they become eligible for removal, regardless of other Vote Kick restrictions.<br />
When players queue as a group with a tank or a healer, and the tank or healer drops group (or is kicked) within the first 5 minutes, all of the other players who queued with them are removed from the group as well.<br />
If there is a group of 3 or more friends and someone in that group initiates a Vote Kick of a random party member, it now requires 4 votes to kick the player, instead of the standard 3 votes.<br />
The penalty for using the Vote Kick feature too often is not issued to a player who kicks someone with whom they queued for a dungeon (i.e. the party member being selected for removal is not a player randomly selected via the Dungeon Finder).<br />
The penalty for using the Vote Kick feature too often will be issued much more quickly to players who join as a party of 4 and kick the randomly selected 5th player.<br />
The penalty for using the Vote Kick feature too often will now not allow the player to initiate a Vote Kick for 2 hours, up from 45 minutes.<br />
These changes will require realm restarts to take effect. More information can be found here.<br />
<br />
<br />
Dungeons &amp; Raids<br />
<br />
When switching a normal raid dungeon over to Heroic difficulty, players were instantly becoming saved without warning. There is now a warning dialog box which will appear before the difficulty is changed.<br />
<br />
<br />

Today's Hotfixes<br />
We actually spent a bit of time talking to the designers about this very topic, and it's something they're well aware of and realize isn't always ideal.<br />
<br />
A few really great points came out of that meeting, though:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Some changes in 4.0.6 and/or 4.0.6a were just wrong. For a myriad of reasons the changes made in 4.0.6/4.0.6a either did not pan out as expected, or were simply mis-calculations/interpretations. Which is the reason for a number of the quick reversions and changes in hotfixes shortly after the patch.<br />
<br />
<br />
While there was feedback from the PTR on what is broken, overpowered, underpowered, etc. there simply wasn't enough data and real world proof for us to make changes. Forum posts always make a lot of noise. It's difficult to separate the seed from the chaff. Yes, it turned out a number of reports proved to be accurate once the 4.0.6's hit the masses and we were able to get a sample size that showed us what needed adjusting.<br />
<br />
<br />
The third point discussed was that we have an obligation to deploy hotfixes when we feel we're making quality of life-improvements, fixing errors, or simply making good balance changes. Good balance is very much debatable among who you ask, of course. ;)<br />
<br />
<br />
Fourth point really struck home with all of the designers, and that's that they also have an obligation to not use the live realms as a balancing laboratory. That while the changes being made have seemed very quick and sporadic at times, that there is thought and planning going in to them, and they are consciously avoiding throwing out changes and seeing what happens. While some changes have been implemented and then reverted, it's not because a lot of thought and effort didn't go into them, but that simply they didn't work as intended.<br />
<br />
<br />
I know a lot of us remember the old days where classes would sit without changes for months, in some cases years for specific mechanics. A class would dominate for 6 months, and that's just how the game was. While we think good, measured changes in patches is far more visible and understandable, that hotfixes allow so much more to offering immediate relief that we'd be remiss in not using them to offer a better game experience to you, the players. There's an agreement that 4.0.6 and 4.0.6a have been pretty chaotic with hotfixes, and that's due to a number of issues that we don't consider to be 'usual'. We fully expect them to slow down substantially from this point, and we really appreciate everyone who stays on top of the hotfix blog, and relates the changes as they're made to their guildies and friends.

To which i'd like to offer a bit of reasoning. The differences in sample size between their in house testing, or even PTR, and live are staggering statistically.<br />
<br />
Also, as anyone who's looked at actual statistical studies, or scientific papers can tell you, statistics can often paint a bit of a funny picture depending on various factors (like error bar size or p values).<br />
<br />
Does it excuse the knee jerk reactions these hotfixes seem to apply to, probably not, but i hope it adds a little perspective to how this situation may come about.</div></div><hr />

I don't get it. Were you people not around when specs were not even usable and bugs lasted literally months? The number of people on the PTR is low, and many of those who are on the PTR aren't even testing numbers but rather seeing what is brand new in the patch. I've been on the PTR, and trust me there are very few people raiding if it's not a brand new instance. How many people do you think tested 4.0 raids on the 4.0.6 PTR that would help with the numbers? I also agree with the forum chatter because while some classes/people were right about what was going on, three times as many are simply stating dumb things and it's tough to sort through what is true.<br />
<br />
Also, people realize the alternative is delaying every patch by 4-6 weeks right? Would you rather wait another month or so for 4.0.6 or play it and have them change some small things along the way?</div></div><hr />

All I really want to hear at this point is a reversal of all class changes made in patch 4.0.6. Yes, I play a warlock and yes we did get hit far harder than any other class.

Yeah, the hotfix to Body and Soul made me try switching my spec to get it again. Then, the next day, they revert it back. I understand changes and balancing, but it's been pretty crazy lately. They seem a little unsure of themselves and the decisions they are making.</div></div><hr />

QFT!!!<br />
With the pre-nerf Juggernaut,Throwdown and Heroic Leap,arms warriors had an 80% uptime on even the heavy kiters out there ( hunters and frost mages) with only their short to medium cds used,without incoming dispels or a partner help.....and that is something no hard hitting melee,with lots of interrupts should have!! Beside,the warrior class received a lot of improves such as : removed the old stances penalties and buffs to the new,overhauled ones,pummel in battle stance for reliable interrupts and with the new Tactical Mastery talent ( available to all 3 speccs) you can stance-dance all night long( or day) and won't OOR...and probably other stuffs I can't think of right now!<br />
<br />
On the other hand,same issue was with ferals....their old and heavy OP shapeshifting was a compromise they were allowed with because they lacked the damage,interrupts and in wotlk their only chance to kill a geared player was related to a 3 min cd!! Right now they have very high damage(more than half of it is ignoring armor),interrupts and lots of their old talents and some of their current skills had been reworked into a better ones,so was obvious they had to pay the mobility price.</div></div><hr />

Body and soul change makes zero sense, they're trying to prefent DISC priests from shield spamming so they make shields more expensive then give disc priests a mana return buff with rapture but remove the mana cost reduction from holy?<br />

Two month passed but the fixes are still endless. The main question is: when will we stop playing so prolonged &quot;Beta&quot; and start to play totally completed product? Never? Just because this 4.0.x patch is still incompleted and very soon Blizz will have to start thinking about next content patch - 4.1.x. And even more - they will have to start to think about next addon very soon! As you may know according to the leaked Blizz future plans this addon will lasts only 1.5 years. Not 2 years. So keeping in mind that Blizzards stopped to develop LK and concentate all their forces on the new addon for about a year before Cataclysm release they will have to turn off their work on Cataclysm very soon - in about 4 month.</div></div><hr />

Ya know it causes me great pains when Bliz says &quot;we are nerfing spell X, cause we feel that using spells A, B, C, and D provide more interesting game play&quot;. <br />
<br />
In my opinion using only heal, greater heal, CoH (or Pennance) , and PoH really isn't &quot;more interesting gameplay&quot;. I used more of my spells raiding in WOTLK, because I wasn't penalized for using them. I am not saying that we should go back to WOTLK raiding style, but make our entire spell book usable, in a sense that we can come up with a true &quot;play style&quot; rather than this monotonous rotation style healing.</div></div><hr />

I don't know how-else to explain it other than doing a bad job. I know its tough to balance a game but lets be honest, its over the top, its almost as bad as Reb Brown screaming while shooting people in a bad B.flick in the 80's. <br />

<br />
So I think this LFG changes are useless and will only make good players life harder just because they will not be able to kick bad players anymore. May be Blizz sould remove kick ability at all? Or may be they should remove LFG at all cuz it's main purpose is to force good players help bad players to became good players too and good players will be forced to find groups manually leaving bad players alone anyway?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Bare in mind that Rapture has a 12 sec CD (doesnt say in tooltip), which makes shield spamming a nonsense as we dont get 7% mana back for each shield that gets fully absorbed; in a span of 12 sec that is, so it makes the use of PW: S somewhat tactical if you want max mana regen efficiency. The shield on raid bosses gets absorbed in max 2 hits thats lets say 2-4 sec so we have about 8+sec to focus on other spells meanwhile. As for Body and Soul the revert was uncalled for imo or at least a 50% nerf would be just fine if they werent satisfied with it.</div></div><hr />

Mainreason why shadow and balance druid did and do so much dmg ist A. Multidot encounter... (totally ok there) B. Dark Intent.. bliz could just fix Dark Intent, or make it a passiv Warlock ability not a spell casted on other classes. Singletarget DPS without DI we are now rank 10/12 after the LOL MM Hunter, Rogues, Mages, Furys.. etc etc.. so thats for the point &quot;blizz balancing politics.</div></div><hr />

I think the devs have been pretty accurate and you definitely get a feel that almost everyone is viable now, and the classes that are not, or getting buffs while others are getting nerfed.<br />
<br />
It does need to end though. Now that the devs have had their chance to optimize things, players also need time to learn to optimize their classes. With all these changes, it is very hard to develop your ´sweet spot´ especially with gear and to a lesser degree with rotation. The devs need to stop messing with individual spells or stats if they want to balance things, and instead just do small changes that affect everything.. similar to the 2'handed weapon change for arms. It will help make arms for viable, but not require the actual players from having to relearn new priorities for gear or rotation.<br />
<br />
But my biggest problem with all these changes is that fansites (and therefore moderately informed players) are out of date. There are sticky threads on multiple sites that are outdated now, but that ´knowledge´has already become cannon for a lot of players.</div></div><hr />

Likewise yourself. Please, blizzard is &quot;the leader&quot; in MMOs, they have the money, knowledge, and skill to make it work. But they don't. They DON'T put the money back into the game, their best devs are off on other games right now, and who they're left with because of this does not have the skill to make it work. The game is in shambles. I've learned that when a new MMO that's about to launch which is vastly more a balancing nightmare due to the insane possibility their skill trees provide, is better balanced than a game that's heading to a decade in age, there is something majorly wrong here. Yes, RIFT is better balanced, and surprisingly has fewer bugs than WoW does live. And trust me, RIFT is a BIG game which is heavy on the content, before you blizzy-boys come to blizzard's defense.<br />
<br />
Blizzard lost a lot of respect of players here in this last patch. People are finally sick of their ways of &quot;we know best, screw the consumer&quot;, and their elementary &quot;balancing&quot; methods as well as how lackluster the content really is that the honeymoon is over. Blizzard really needs to step up their game as a brand new MMO is exposing them for their worth, not to mention they have to deal with a Star Wars MMO and Guild Wars 2 this year as well. This may finally be the end of WoW's dominance, it won't die, but it certainly won't own as much of the market.</div></div><hr />

For what ever reason, Blizzard can't change tooltips in a hotfix. So you might be getting the extra attack power from the Aspect of the Hawk buff in this hotfix, but the numbers on the character panel do not reflect it.<br />
<br />
I guess it is because tooltips are client side and Blizzard is only messing with server side in the hotfixes? No matter what, I think it is in bad form to change stuff and not have it reflected in the UI. It makes everything a little confusing and messy.</div></div><hr />

Huh? The mechanics haven't changed that much between Vanilla and now. Perhaps some of these problems are adding things to the game (say, Heroic Leap) that the engine's just not up to handling. But my warrior's basic mechanics didn't change significantly between 2004 and now (I'm not talking new abilities, I'm talking how the class actually functions). <br />
<br />
If there's that much old junk code that's causing that much of a problem for the current game, then Blizzard really needs to think about updating the engine (and yes, I know how big of a project that would be). What's happening here is more like Blizzard is just changing things for the sake of changing things, and there's no longer any rhyme or reason. I mean, when Blizzard says &quot;hey, a lot of the 4.0.6 changes were just wrong&quot;, and &quot;we made sure the designers know not to use the live realms for a balancing laboratory&quot;, it doesn't take a brain surgeon to figure out that they don't have as much of a clue what they're doing as some would like to think they do.<br />
<br />
Bottom line - they know and we know that Cata has lots of problems, but instead of sitting down and fixing them methodically and competently, they're just throwing things against the wall and hoping something sticks. And so far, not a lot has. It has nothing to do with the size of the game, or the complexity of the code. After all, it took quite a while to go from 11 or 11.5 million subscribers to 12 million, right? This game's been the size it is for long enough for them to be able to get this stuff straightened out.</div></div><hr />

I'm just getting images of a bunch of devs sitting in their armchairs getting high and lol'ing at all the players flocking to forums to try and understand what's going on.<br />
<br />
If it ain't broke, don't fix it.<br />
<br />
Nice to see some feral changes made it in as well......</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Prothall</div><div class="date">2011-02-19, 04:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don´t have a problem with this flurry of hotfixes. I think the devs have been pretty accurate and you definitely get a feel that almost everyone is viable now, and the classes that are not, or getting buffs while others are getting nerfed.<br />
<br />
It does need to end though. Now that the devs have had their chance to optimize things, players also need time to learn to optimize their classes. With all these changes, it is very hard to develop your ´sweet spot´ especially with gear and to a lesser degree with rotation. The devs need to stop messing with individual spells or stats if they want to balance things, and instead just do small changes that affect everything.. similar to the 2'handed weapon change for arms. It will help make arms for viable, but not require the actual players from having to relearn new priorities for gear or rotation.<br />
<br />
But my biggest problem with all these changes is that fansites (and therefore moderately informed players) are out of date. There are sticky threads on multiple sites that are outdated now, but that ´knowledge´has already become cannon for a lot of players.<br />
<br />
This is a good point. After the 2.0 and 3.0 patches, things were relatively stable for a good amount of time before big changes were made. People had time to play with the new abilities and see what worked best and what didn't. With Cata and 4.0, things are changing so rapidly that people are still trying to figure out what the hell they should be doing. Go take a look at Tankspot (if you can make it past their front page, which appears to be nothing more than a YouTube mirror these days). There are recent threads where people are saying &quot;we're still trying to figure out all the math and everything&quot;. And the expansion's been out for over two months now (and patch 4.0 for about three months now).<br />
<br />
How can the players tell Blizzard what works and what doesn't, when the classes change so often that nobody can actually play the game long enough to find out what works and what doesn't? I think a lot of what Blizzard's calling &quot;noise&quot; and &quot;clutter&quot; and the like on the forums is really people trying to say &quot;stop jerking the classes around whenever you get the urge, and let us actually work with this stuff and figure out what the hell is really going on here&quot;.</div></div><hr />

It's sad to say, but as it stands with it's &quot;custom skill trees&quot; (aka pick your trees, mix-n-match), it's actually better balanced than this game and it didn't even launch yet, this is from beta. It goes to show how lazy blizzard has become, or actually were the whole time. This will be the first MMO to put a real dent in WoW's playerbase as it exposes blizzard for what they are and WoW is. At the very least, hopefully it'll get blizz to put more effort into WoW. Maybe give them some new ideas to steal from again like they have in the past.</div></div><hr />

Go give it a try - it's in open beta until Monday. You don't have to pay a thing, and I think you'll be pleasantly surprised. When you play a class, it doesn't change every twenty minutes because one of the developers spilled some Mountain Dew all over their shirt or something.</div></div><hr />

Get real beta testers. People in wow pay to beta test while a beta tester on the ps3 gets 20-35$ and hour. Keep using little kids who hide their uber spec for live and you will continue to get these kind of results</div></div><hr />

I think it was 100% weapon damage and a lot less RAP*%. 50% more weapon damage doesn't take a 5k-10k hit 15k-20k crit noodle shot to a +23k hit +60k crit truck shot.As I couldn't remember all the changes made to Aimed shot since 4.0, I took the 150% value from latest patch notes, seems like those are not reasonable place to look for info :&lt;</div></div><hr />

Normally I wouldn't post about rift in this, but since you want to be derogatory I will. Right now out of every soul combination there is only 2 that are considered by the community to not be balanced. Guess what, the devs answered within ONE day and actually listened to the community about how to fix it. Not just the qqers, but the people that play those souls too. When my gf insisted I try RIFT I was really skeptical. I went in expecting to hate it, now we have both preordered. The way they interact with the community reminds me of how Blizz used to be before they got to the point where they didn't care about competition. <br />
<br />
I would rather have a game that isn't as crowded, where the devs feel like they have to earn their numbers, over a game that is number 1 but most of the people aren't happy. Where's my proof people aren't happy? Log into the game and ask some of them. <br />
<br />
So let's not bring rift up in these channels. The game is great, the events are awesome, but still it's inappropriate to talk about it in this forum. The only reason I did was to properly inform someone that is not informed.</div></div><hr />

Back in the glory days, Blizzard didn't do what was best for the masses of grass chewing casual sheep that infested this terrible game. They did what was best fore the game, to make it an awesome experience. Now, anybody has any tiny qq, Blizzard jumps and fixes something. Which in turn creates more tears. Well, they they jump higher and fix something else to please that group! That change in turn creates a lake full of tears. Well hey, lets just spam those hotfixes, we'll get it right eventually! <br />

This is exactly it. Blizzard &quot;USED&quot; to care about the game and it's gamers. Now they do stuff on a whim, whenever they feel like it, without listening to what's actually going on. Trion actually DID listen to the people saying &quot;x&quot; is OP, so they went by what the &quot;x&quot; players were saying how to balance them and guess what, things balanced out nicely thus far. The problem is it's not the main directors on WoW right now. They all basically moved onto Titan, or their main focus is on Titan, thus why WoW has been heavily degrading over the past recent years. It's painful to see my most played game of all time to fall into oblivion due to egotistical yet lazy devs, so much of my spare time put into it. I wanted to see WoW go down in a blaze of glory, instead it's walking the plank with it's pants down.</div></div><hr />

When the game gets as big as WoW is now, of course balance and debugging is going to be alot harder. There still probably alot of old code that has caused a mess of things when converting for cata.<br />

I think most here just like to see themselves post and dont know anything.<br />

One thing to remember though, is blizzard has spread out there staff quite a bit over the past couple of years. with SC2, D3 , Project Titan. And WoW.

And why should people care about the reason why the game is turning into shit? It's not my problem but Blizzards.<br />
If they really have problems they could've easily delayed Cataclysm, and pushed it into spring 2011 release (about now) and ironed out more of the major problems and balanced the game a bit more. <br />
<br />
I just want to play the game which I'm paying for, I don't want to listen to them make excuses why this, this and this wasn't fixed when it should have been. They've made a mistake cool, no problem, but they are not learning, they are making same stupid mistakes over and over again and then try to feed us some text that they think will sooth the paying customer. I don't like where this is going. Ever since Ghostcrawler took over the reins, the game is going downwards - I'm not saying he's the one to put the blame on but probably a lot of stuff changed when he took over and it changed for the worse. <br />
<br />
The game was never so out of balance as it is right now. <br />
<br />
Not to mention that they cut 50% of interesting stuff out of the game that they promised (Guild Talent Trees, Path of Titans, etc.)<br />

<br />
They have ~4600 employees, I don't care if 2000 of those are marketing, secretaries, cup holders or Game Masters, 4600 people is not a small team. If we can get perfect games by developers who employ only 15 people why don't we get a properly balanced, fixed, game with the mass blizzard has. If they dedicate 100 people to WoW it's more as they need, but I bet they have more as 100 working on it so... It's in no way a small team, they've just lost touch with their game. <br />
<br />
I mean, they've done it in the past, they just started drifting recently and it's noticed by everyone, and customer dissatisfaction is obviously their new important bug to fix.</div></div><hr />

When's the last time you got WINDFURYOWNED but a shaman using a 2-hander? Or getting demolished (And i mean tears rolling down your face, &quot;what did I do to deserve this?&quot;) by a warrior or lock in AB?<br />
<br />
This thread just goes to show you how people with the lousiest and least well thought out opinions use internet forums to find other small-minded folk to agree with. <br />
<br />
Please tell me the &quot;+2000 ap to AoH&quot; is a joke, that's basically like nerfing aimed shot then rebuffing it along with all of a hunters other abilities...... who's ready for the AS+Arcane Shot+Arcane Shot powerskill combo? I sure am.<br />
<br />
The day they stop avidly paying attention to their game and balancing it is the day I stop playing. To put it simply, it's the maintenance and attention to the small problems that keep a car running to 300k+ miles on a single engine, not just taking it in for an oil change ever 5k miles. I can't state this enough, but Blizzard has the money to keep some of the best talent in the world employed with them, and it seems they do a good job of checking their egos and FIXING the game, whether that be changing a long standing mechanic (power-shifting) or nerfing the ludicrous mobility of a class with the ability to our stun and out damage a rogue.<br />
<br />
As for Rift.... blatant WoW ripoff with a few Hat-tricks thrown in to make it look different. I understand that all MMOs share some commonalities, but this Rift feels like what Blizzard would make WoW2 play like.</div></div><hr />

And what do people say if they have to service their car every other month? That it's a shit car, and next time they are avoiding the brand. What we have right now in WoW with your analogy is like driving our cars to the service station every week or even twice a week and if I had to do that in reality I would go nuts and punch the service guy in the face long time ago. A car is there to be driven without failing on you or needing adjustments to fuel injection every week. Maintenance is fine, but you don't maintain the engine every week but on a service schedule and if you hold to the schedule the car will be running for 50+ years. <br />
<br />
If you are into cars and like to tinker around in your garage every day - good for you, but for the same thing Blizzard got their internal servers and test realms, so they don't have to tinker with the game on live realms and change the way the game plays every other day for the 11 million customers that just want to play a stable game. If there is a critical bug, like for example the cog-wheel of death and other important issues, sure patch the game ASAP, but when it comes to balance of classes, take your time, test, adjust, test again and then apply the patch and do that on test servers not on live. I'm not getting paid to test, in fact, as it looks now I'm paying to test - that's just not how things work in reality.</div></div><hr />

Ya know it causes me great pains when Bliz says &quot;we are nerfing spell X, cause we feel that using spells A, B, C, and D provide more interesting game play&quot;. <br />
<br />
In my opinion using only heal, greater heal, CoH (or Pennance) , and PoH really isn't &quot;more interesting gameplay&quot;. I used more of my spells raiding in WOTLK, because I wasn't penalized for using them. I am not saying that we should go back to WOTLK raiding style, but make our entire spell book usable, in a sense that we can come up with a true &quot;play style&quot; rather than this monotonous rotation style healing.<br />
<br />
Seems to me Blizzard is saying &quot; We are not interested in how YOU play your toon. We want you to play it like we would play it. Blizzard needs to get out of the office and get on the planet that the rest of us are living on. if you go outside, you will find that the real world is not &quot;Balanced&quot;. People that put an effort forth in real life go farther and have more sucess. People that are &quot;Carried&quot; don't go far and generally suck at life too. NEWS FLASH TO BLIZZARD-----Stop rewarding people that don't try. Your only creating more QQ posts.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaneiac</div><div class="date">2011-02-20, 06:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">And what do people say if they have to service their car every other month? That it's a shit car, and next time they are avoiding the brand. What we have right now in WoW with your analogy is like driving our cars to the service station every week or even twice a week and if I had to do that in reality I would go nuts and punch the service guy in the face long time ago. A car is there to be driven without failing on you or needing adjustments to fuel injection every week. Maintenance is fine, but you don't maintain the engine every week but on a service schedule and if you hold to the schedule the car will be running for 50+ years. <br />
<br />
If you are into cars and like to tinker around in your garage every day - good for you, but for the same thing Blizzard got their internal servers and test realms, so they don't have to tinker with the game on live realms and change the way the game plays every other day for the 11 million customers that just want to play a stable game. If there is a critical bug, like for example the cog-wheel of death and other important issues, sure patch the game ASAP, but when it comes to balance of classes, take your time, test, adjust, test again and then apply the patch and do that on test servers not on live. I'm not getting paid to test, in fact, as it looks now I'm paying to test - that's just not how things work in reality.<br />
<br />
<br />
You're right, they're not. Thank god you're playing a video game and not relying on a critical service like a car.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why do you need data? Do you not play the game? <br />
<br />
Get real beta testers. People in wow pay to beta test while a beta tester on the ps3 gets 20-35$ and hour. Keep using little kids who hide their uber spec for live and you will continue to get these kind of results<br />

hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahah I wish, hahahahahaha, oh man, people really have no idea how bad testing in games is, do they?</div></div><hr />

I agreed with the nerf after buffing the shadow priest, I still deal a lot of dmg. And I also agree with the nerf (increasing PW:S mana cost) to avoid shields spamming. I'm pretty sure there are things that could be done better, but I'm totally satisfied with my current favourite class. Gratz and thanks Blizzard.</div></div><hr />

Real beta testers will not be able to help blizzard get the required data needed for online games. There a many varying factors to online games that are not present on with single player games and most games with online play. Many ps3, xbox and wii games can be launched with poor online because of consumer internet setups and people finding things that have gone unoticed during testing (like king of fighters XII latency problems or Ken being OP in SFIV or the bugs in halo reach). In single player games if something goes unnoticed it's usually something that wont affect other peoples experience or cause much stress. Alot of developers now days when they release a game with online gaming as a big part of the process use the community to beta test for these reasons.<br />
<br />
I would rather Blizzard fix things now. PTR never works out well nor does any test realm patches for any mmo game.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Babi</div><div class="date">2011-02-21, 02:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Likewise yourself. Please, blizzard is &quot;the leader&quot; in MMOs, they have the money, knowledge, and skill to make it work. But they don't. They DON'T put the money back into the game, their best devs are off on other games right now, and who they're left with because of this does not have the skill to make it work. The game is in shambles. I've learned that when a new MMO that's about to launch which is vastly more a balancing nightmare due to the insane possibility their skill trees provide, is better balanced than a game that's heading to a decade in age, there is something majorly wrong here. Yes, RIFT is better balanced, and surprisingly has fewer bugs than WoW does live. And trust me, RIFT is a BIG game which is heavy on the content, before you blizzy-boys come to blizzard's defense.<br />
<br />
Blizzard lost a lot of respect of players here in this last patch. People are finally sick of their ways of &quot;we know best, screw the consumer&quot;, and their elementary &quot;balancing&quot; methods as well as how lackluster the content really is that the honeymoon is over. Blizzard really needs to step up their game as a brand new MMO is exposing them for their worth, not to mention they have to deal with a Star Wars MMO and Guild Wars 2 this year as well. This may finally be the end of WoW's dominance, it won't die, but it certainly won't own as much of the market.<br />
Yeah I don't believe this kind of hype anymore.<br />
<br />
Better this better that, same thing about was said about Warhammer which is sitting with the most pathetic state of game right I've ever seen, it's almost laughable how bad it's gotten and how far it's fallen.<br />
<br />
The determining factor here is the 1 year hill, if it can survive that without a major bleed, it's doing good, if not it's dead like every other MMO that's come out.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DKThaelias</div><div class="date">2011-02-21, 04:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So what Blizzard is really admitted to is that they're overwhelmed with development issues since Cata launched. Hmm, could this be because everyone told them they were releasing too soon? That they kept changing their design intent for raid dps/tanking/healing up until the last minute? That content wasn't complete at launch, was buggy, and they had to freeze the pvp itemization and live-develop Sinestra. Think about that a moment, they were live-debugging end-of-tier raiding.<br />
<br />
Complete, utter, garbage. Consider that this is a game that's been out for years. With the amount of history behind their development they have no excuse (other than meeting Christmas deadline) for such piss-poor knee-jerk changes.</div></div><hr />

I have exactly the same question after reading this news. Do they mean Presidents Day (February 21)? Is it a holiday in US?</div></div><hr />

I keep watching for an Ele fix so I can come back and play WoW again.<br />
<br />
Yeah, I finally just can't stand the lack of forthought into Ele. I havent logged into wow for 2 weeks except to say hi to a friend once for 10 minutes. I hadn't been off of wow for a day ever in 6 years. 780 days played. Even if they did &quot;fix&quot; ele it would be something i would not trust. Kinda funny Warriors and Paladins and Dk's get fixed all the time and so fast. I would much rather play something that goes up to the top, and back down to middle than something that has never ever been at the top.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Please tell me the &quot;+2000 ap to AoH&quot; is a joke, that's basically like nerfing aimed shot then rebuffing it along with all of a hunters other abilities<br />
<br />
Uh, that's the point. Hunters aren't doing too much dps, people are crying that it can crit for 80k. Too much of the hunter's overall damage is locked up in a few abilities, so they're spreading the damage out over everything. Hopefully it will buff the pathetically bad SV spec into playability again.</div></div><hr />

you misrepresent that quote..... in essence it seems like they are giving the class MORE burst, not just spreading the damage out.</div></div><hr />

Hotfix...reverse next day. No wait, do it again. WAIT, reverse!.....Okay, it is getting a little tiring honestly. Please just work on a patch and get that released instead of all this experimentation on the live servers picking on everyone's nerves. I am not surprised though. Blizzard developers never could really get things done properly the first time. Get your shit together already, common!</div></div><hr />
