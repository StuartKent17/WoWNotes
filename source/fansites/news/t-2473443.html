<br />
The Trial of Style Has Begun: How's Your Strut?<br />
Ladies and gentlemen of the Horde and Alliance, synchronize your wardrobes and prepare to do battle. The Trial of Style has arrived, and it’s time to put your transmogrification skills to the test.<br />
<br />
You’re Invited!<br />
When: March 20–March 24<br />
Where: Queue for the 6-player scenario at your friendly neighborhood transmog NPC.<br />
What: Contestants will have two minutes to create transmog sets from items in their collection based on themes presented in the scenario. Two players at a time will be pulled up on stage to strike a pose and show off their creation—leaving the remaining four to vote on just who of the two has managed to capture the theme best.<br />
<br />
Collect All the Looks<br />
Collect all 12 Ensembles to keep adventuring in style.<br />

You can also use your Trial of Style Tokens on props to supplement your chosen Trial of Style ensemble. These props are consumable and will only appear when you’re on stage, but will last through the entirety of the competition.<br />
<br />
Vendor extraordinaire Nellie Voguesong sells shirts and tabards in the Trial of Style, just in case you forgot to bring one with you.<br />

<br />
Strike a pose and do your little turn (on the catwalk; yeah, on the catwalk).<br />
<br />
Once the glitter settles and the votes are tallied, First Place, Second Place, and Third Place winners will be awarded. Don’t worry—even if you don’t win, there’s always the Trial of Style Consolation Prize. These prizes contain Trial of Style Tokens, which can be redeemed for special transmog gear in Dalaran.<br />
<br />
Fashion-conscious citizens of Azeroth can also take advantage of transmogrification and barbershop services for free during the Trial of Style. Even if you don’t participate, you can adjust your hairstyle and transmog for no gold cost while the event is active.<br />

Bring it!<br />

Crucible of Storms Drop Tuning<br />
When Crucible of Storms was originally added to the 8.1.5 PTR a few weeks ago, we included full drop tables for both Restless Cabal and Uu’nat. We designed Crucible of Storms drops to be somewhat different than items that have been dropping thus far in Uldir and Battle of Dazar’alor – this is a new chapter in the story that takes us to a different, stranger place.<br />
<br />
We’ve recently gone through those items and tuned them up to fit closer to expectations, and in most cases, to power up their bonus effects. Here are some examples of changes we’ve made since the items first hit the PTR:<br />
<br />
<br />
Fa'thuul's Floodguards (https://www.wowdb.com/items/167842-fathuuls-floodguards?bonusIDs=1517)<br />
<br />
Damage increased by ~25%<br />
Healing increased by ~25%<br />
<br />
Abyssal Speaker's Gauntlets (https://www.wowdb.com/items/167841-abyssal-speakers-gauntlets?bonusIDs=1517)<br />
<br />
Shield increased by ~200%<br />
<br />
Mindthief's Eldritch Clasp (https://www.wowdb.com/items/167840-mindthiefs-eldritch-clasp?bonusIDs=1517)<br />
<br />
Health restored and consumed increased by ~35%<br />
<br />
Grips of Forsaken Sanity (https://www.wowdb.com/items/167839-grips-of-forsaken-sanity?bonusIDs=1517)<br />
<br />
Damage increased by ~25%<br />
<br />
Legplates of Unbound Anguish (https://www.wowdb.com/items/167217-legplates-of-unbound-anguish?bonusIDs=1517)<br />
<br />
Damage increased by ~25%<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
We’ve been making these adjustments via hotfix to the PTR since Friday, and we don’t expect that you’re going to see them via datamining immediately, but know that these are intended changes, and hopefully they’re now quite close to final values.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Tiger's Peak Temporarily Closing<br />
In order to fix some issues with Tiger’s Peak, we’re removing it from the pool of Arena maps. This should take place during our next scheduled maintenance. We expect to re-open this Arena in a future update to the game.<br />

<br />
I think it's weird that they aren't saying what is wrong with it. They did something similar with the Ring of Valor arena years ago and we still haven't gotten it back.<br />
<br />
At this point I think Blizzard just wants to remove things.</div></div><hr />

Nope; it's a recolour of the cloth set from the 4.3 instances in Cataclysm, such as End Times.<br />

Well, of the two classes that use mail, only one of the five specs is a healer spec. The rest are damage specs.</div></div><hr />

They state when they release Trail of Style that the set they will bring one are more simple recolor of old dungoens sets. Alot of ppl want this simpler version of armor for transmog.<br />
Plus if they bring the MoP challange set back i will piss alot of ppl that own those. Since u cant get those items anymore.<br />

<br />
activision/blizzard been a thing since the age of WotLK. So stop blaming activision for the state of the game. They just trying new things and it didnt work.<br />
I mean Leg ion was a really good expansion, and that was last year.<br />
<br />
Is just a cycle that blizzard been suffering with each expansion. I hope 8.2 bring new life with the remake of the neck and the new zone. But we will see.</div></div><hr />
