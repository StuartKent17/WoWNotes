For a CE it is among the cheaper ones that I have seen, especially in the last few years with $150+ CE's for PS3/4 and Xbox because of giant statues and other things. I've seen my brother spend $250 on one CE because of said statue that was included.</div></div><hr />

Don't be daft, if you are referring to WoD, you haven't played the xpac yet so your BAM! is in fact just a &quot;poof...&quot;. If you are referring to MoP...well, subjectivity. I've never been let down by the CE's so far.</div></div><hr />

No thanks,especially since its the same like all the other CE's. A soundtrack that I can easily download from YouTube,including the soundtrack from future patches that the CE does not include,dumb SC II and Diablo III portraits/banners,behind the scenes (that I can again,download myself),an artbook and guess what,a mousepad. I can't see what exactly is worth 90$ here?</div></div><hr />

1. I don't need or want murlock pets. <br />
2. WoD is all about ugly iron horde crap, which is fine but I don't need or want their ugly mount or pet. <br />
3. Aside from one or two listens of the soundtracks, the CEs didn't do anything for me, so it didn't make sense to keep buying them.</div></div><hr />

It's only $10 more than the other CEs. If an extra $10s is too much, then don't get it. And $90 was the set price when it was announced as well. This isn't &quot;new&quot; information.</div></div><hr />

I heard that for MoP, if you talked to Blizz Customer Service that once you got the actual CE at release and showed them proof of purchase and applied the code, they'd &quot;refund&quot; you for the digital prepurchase in the form of a couple of months of game time. The details might be off, but there was definitely some form of game time compensation</div></div><hr />

Er...the one Amazon has is the same one that's shown here. Do you mean the back of the box? The backs of the Collector's Editions are pretty much blank. The image showing all the stuff you get in them isn't part of the box (it's not even the same shape).</div></div><hr />

You can still buy the Cataclysm and Mists of Pandaria, which first retailed for $80, right now, brand new on Amazon for about $50.<br />

<br />
Not really. It's only $10 more than what it has been since Wrath. It was $69.99 for BC. Still cheaper than most CEs you get from some games anyway. The Artbook alone would be about $50 or $60 if sold separately from Blizzard, anyway.</div></div><hr />

That said, I've never bought a boxed CE, I wish I bought D3's one for the original wings, and I nearly bought RoS CE.<br />

You are referring to brand new games tho. Far from a fan of CoD but their limited edition (for a full game), is as expansive as a WoW expansion pack. To my taste, that is ridiculous, but if they keep making these things, its because some people could careless about it and keep buying overpriced items.</div></div><hr />

The pet alone is worth the extra 10 bucks from the regular digital though, Dread Hatchling is pretty much a staple pet any time I'm fighting aquatics because it is fast and hits like a truck (Gilnean Raven on steroids).</div></div><hr />

The only decent things the WoW CEs offer are the bonus digital content. Hubby and I have previous collector's editions for WoW from BC thru Cata (we have the Vanilla CE pets because of our Dell WoW Edition M1730 laptop), but we never play the music or look at the books, nor do we use the mousepads (Razer Goliathus or bust - only decent product Razer makes), so they're ultimately just bulky dust collectors. Worse, with two of us, we have multiples taking up space. <br />
<br />
If only they had something cool like the D3 CE Diablo Skull, which has a permanent home on my desk (not very girly of me, but it is so damn awesome), but the physical items that come in the WoW CEs are (for us) an utter yawn fest.<br />

Nice cheap Collector's Edition &lt;3 already forking out $210 in November for my DA3 CE.<br />
<br />
Yes, but look at what you're getting for the DA3 CE, and compare/contrast the WoD CE. <br />
<br />
From GameSpot (http://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-age-inquisition-s-huge-inquisitor-s-edition-costs-170/1100-6419606/), the DA3 CE comes with:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Highly detailed exclusive Inquisitor's Edition case produced by TriForce measures approximately 8.5&quot; x 13.5&quot; x 14.5&quot;<br />
The case is individually wrapped in faux reptile skin, has the mark of the Inquisitor stamped on top in gold foil, with an interior fitted with imprinted red silk.<br />
Cloth map of Thedas drawn to scale measuring approximately 22&quot; x 32&quot;<br />
72 card Major and Minor Arcana tarot card deck with custom artwork depicting mythology from Dragon Age lore.<br />
Inquisitor full scale, six piece, lock tool set<br />
One set of four full scale map markers each approximately measuring 3.5&quot; x 3.5&quot; x 4&quot;<br />
Inquisitor's Badge<br />
Quill and Inkpot<br />
40-page Inquisitor's Journal<br />
Orlesian Coins<br />
Limited edition SteelBook case to house your copy of the game</div></div><hr />

However I do believe with the merchandise they have and sell through their store, they could at least pack in a figurine, plushie, authenticator, novels, posters or something similar. Not to draw comparison, but majority of CEs offer a little bit more as the Blizzard ones do, for relatively the same price (speaking on PC, not consoles), looking what I got in the Dark Souls 2 CE, for exactly the same price, sans the behind the scenes. <br />
<br />
Also mouse pads are the lazy way out, because majority of people into gaming have their own desired mouspad already, in fact those standard mouse pads are utter trash.<br />

Couldnt you say that each CoD game is basically an expansion? since it expands on the other games ( Even then its not very much.... )<br />
<br />
I would consider each Call of Duty a new game. You could say it's the same game (fans of the series will strongly disagree), because they are milking the franchise, but then you could say that every Counter-Strike game is the same game too. <br />
<br />
I think I rate something as expansions if: <br />
<br />
A) requires the original game to run<br />
B) offers the old content whilst presenting you with new<br />
<br />
WoW expansions are expansions not new games. I do believe it requires the original game + all expansion to be even able to play it. So the price for the normal version is indeed ridiculous high for an expansion that requires you to buy the Battle Chest(WoW) + Mists of Pandaria which is together $40 + $50 for Warlords of Draenor, it's kinda steep. <br />
<br />
I still remember the time where PC games would cots between $40-50 and expansions would come at $20-25 as it should. Now they try to sell you a hat for $20.</div></div><hr />

You can just buy the digital normal edition, play at midnight, and whenever you buy the CE, email bliz support to return the digital purchase. I had to do this for Mists, as gamestop doesn't do midnight releases anymore.</div></div><hr />

I'm wondering about this too. Where I live I usually get the CE a day or two after launch. Is the free 90 thing limited to preorders or is it part of WoD whenever you buy it?<br />

EDIT: Looks like you get it as part of the expansion, even if you don't preorder.<br />

Just buying the game gets you a boosted 90, its part of their program to get players who have been away for awhile back into the game. You can purchase it 5 months after release and you still get a boosted 90.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
This is their way of herding people into buying the digital versions of their games, which costs nothing more to give to you in a download. Instead of giving you a book and cd's, stuff that cost them money.<br />
<br />
All these companies are getting greedy, its why we see digital copies of everything now.<br />
<br />
Big diffrence? Hard to trade digital movies and comics. Its also hard to justify paying 69.99 for a wow pet.<br />
<br />
<br />
Personally i think they screwed up for short term profit.<br />
<br />
I liked going to the midnight releases and seeing wow players i wouldn't normally see. Now thats gone. <br />
They changed the price because people were complaining that the boxed and digital versions were the same price. <br />

I havent been much of a fan of Activison since they took over.<br />

This years collectors edition is $10 more for a physical copy and actually has less stuff. It has no cards in it anymore.<br />
<br />
If anything these collectors editions should get cheaper. <br />
<br />
The box hasnt changed one bit since ive been buying them(bc) and almost everything that comes inside it has stayed the same minus some of the trial cards to give away to your friends just got bigger in size. <br />
<br />
This years also has a 25% coupon card for the blixxard store in it, but i dont think that justifies the $10 increase. You can buy the digital deluxe off them for $69.99,which im sure they would rather all of us do instead of them having to give us anything physical for our money that they would have to pay for first. Its too bad. Blizz used to be alright about giving back.I dont remember the last year i ever got a game day back credit to play wow for whatever reason. Not like the game has been perfect since either. <br />
<br />
Meh,I love the game,but not activisions business practices.<br />

Or do what anyone with sense does...wait a year and pick it up from Walmart for 15 dollars because they have thousands of unsold copies left nobody wanted to fork out 80 bucks for<br />
<br />
My walmart did not have 1 copy of any wod game, they never got any. Target and BestBuy did though.<br />
<br />
Its $89.99 CE btw and $59.99 for normal copy in the store.</div></div><hr />
