I was hoping for a completely different set of announcements. Goblins...fuck goblins, Horde is already getting bent over the barrell with this expansion why give us green gnomes, adding insult to injury?! No Thrall or Cairne...come on. Regurgitated old world raids...gaaaaay. <br />

About the only thing I'm looking forward to is the flying in vanilla. <br />

I had no idea that existed, I had thought that upon the first rumblings of Cataclysm, since the entire area is so open and ready for development.<br />

Records indicate that the worgen existed for a time in Kalimdor. In fact, more recent evidence suggests that their true origin might have a connection to the night elves and a secretive druidic order from Kalimdor's distant past. Yet until new evidence comes to light, this information remains speculative.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Deepone</div><div class="date">2009-08-21, 08:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My early prediction was that Goblins would be a neutral race in Cataclysm (http://essays.ajs.com/2009/07/world-of-warcraft-cataclysm-maelstrom.html). I just want to say that I'm owning up to being wrong (http://essays.ajs.com/2009/08/world-of-warcraft-cataclysm-no-neutral.html), though I still think that having at least one race not choose sides based on the color of their skin (or at least &quot;coincidentally&quot; in keeping with said coloration) would have been a nice touch. Having a truly neutral race (e.g. one where each player chooses a side, rather than the race) would have been even better. Still, I'm going to play and love Cataclysm, I'm sure. Wrath's phasing and improved art was a turning point for WoW. Add in hard modes and the huge variety in 5-man dungeon types, and they've clearly come a long way. I can't wait to see what they do with the old-world zones.<br />
<br />
I'm going to start a new project now... I'll be doing a bunch of before and after shots when Cataclysm comes out of the zone re-vamps. I hope to do this in a style that will be suitably unique, but we'll see... I'm sure lots of people will slap up tons of before/after shots all over the Web.</div></div><hr />

Apart from that i will be very excited to roll even more classes through revamped azeroth (altoholic as i am, 6 classes at lvl 80 :)).<br />

I was skeptical of all this stuff, thought it was going to suck, but actually seeing it ... it may turn out awesome. Gilneas looks downright creepy, the stories sound like they could be awesome, and the sheer changes to the landscape are staggering (I managed to recognize about four zones in those screenshots as Ashenvale, Desolace, either Azshara or the coast of Ashenvale, and the Barrens.).<br />
<br />
That said, I still have some concerns. I have 4 80's (Three Horde, one Alliance) a number of 70's, I think one 60 still, and the rest are either 40 or still in their tens. It sounds like a LOT of this stuff is going to be around lower levels, so I'm afraid most of the content I may never get a chance to really look at. And this new customization and leveling? It could be really cool or really damn complex. Right now, all we have are names with no details. As blizzcon rolls on hopefully we'll learn a bit more.<br />
<br />
And now I have to figure out what the Goblin races will be so I know what character to delete. Hopefully my priest, the one character I HAVEN'T put any effort into.</div></div><hr />

I already read that, but it's BS.<br />
<br />
Everyone knows where they came from, it's been an established arc and even fleshed out through a huge quest line.<br />

So they're going to retcon everything about the Worgen so the Druid thing is plausible? Lame.</div></div><hr />

Certainly looks to me like the new world tree as well. The one growing below the remains of the old one.<br />
<br />
you can see the roots growing up around and over it, and the new one looks to be on a small island in the well. So maybe they're redesigning the area to give it a better presence.</div></div><hr />

check reflections, this one with antialiasing would be awesome!<br />

I d like to see more reflections to the enviroment like on golden domes etc imagine golden material that reflects sky... , + on metalic materials on buildings mostly, because if the aplly reflection maps on characters the fps will drop dramatically<br />

Is reading really that hard?<br />
<br />
Aside.<br />
<br />
About Deathwing. It's cool to see he ditched the goblin armor to scare the crap out of anyone with a weak stomach, but that chin. It stretches out to next week.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Worgen Druid...... seriously?<br />

<br />
I am really excited that gnomes can finally heal. I've always wanted to roll a priest through the gnome starting area but refuse to start a dwarf. <br />
<br />
Undead Hunters? Wtf? Seriously? And Human Hunters? There are going to be about a million more hunters now.<br />
<br />
I am also disappointed that they are making more than one class druids. Tauren and NE is all I can imagine as druids. I haven't read the lore, but is there any party of it that mentions more and more races as druids?<br />
<br />
Other than the class combos, I am really excited for every other aspect of the game. I was pissed that they are redoing old stuff and not being to creative in Wrath, but I guess it makes sense when you're overhauling 2 whole continents. <br />
<br />
Who wants to bet that every horde player will now have a Goblin as a bank toon?</div></div><hr />

I love theses changes. Still i hope they will focus more on the diffrent forms of druids. Like giving the tree some armor, weapon and pads maybe and redo the shape of feral and bear form so it works with gear somewhat or atleast change the apperence with the total item lv u have on all your items or something.<br />
well well...so..Where is the Draenei warlocks!!!??? I cant belive they missed this! I mean if they let like worgens be druids and night elfs mages why not draeneis be warlocks! <br />
I mean how can gnomes even wear anything near plate with their biceps... :o</div></div><hr />

Sun God? The hell are you talking about? Tauren worship The Earthmother, who could very well be Therazane, and the Earthmother is an embodiment of Nature, not the Holy Light.<br />
<br />
The Tauren have no connection to the Holy Light, you can't just go &quot;ommmmpodamadmommmm&quot; and be a freaking Paladin, you have to have a divine connection to the Holy Light, even if it's by force(Blood Elves previously).<br />
<br />
Sylvanas is not a hunter, she's a Ranger, totally different, so I'm most fascinated as to how that happens, living animals hate and fear the undead.<br />
<br />
As for Tauren, they join the Argent Crusade, bam, Holy Light.<br />
<br />
The implausible part is the whyyyyy.</div></div><hr />

Don't quote me on this, but I remember hearing that the Earthmother is the force of nature, and one eye of some bigger god. The other eye is the force of light, so basically they just started following that eye too (or something like that).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DarkeRaine</div><div class="date">2009-11-03, 03:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">EVERYTHING looks great. I love the old England Dr.Jekyll/Mr.Hyde appearance of Gilneas. I also love the Atlantis/Robinson Crusoe creativeness behind the Goblin's home. As for having a creature added to Alliance that is based on the dweller of Lycanthia is Genius. As for having the Goblins choose a side, And &quot;NOT&quot; as per Hucklebuck's comment, it's brilliant. Have the little green monsters reside with their hideous larger look alikes, Orcs. I think it's grand the Goblin is no longer an NPC. <br />
<br />
I'd just like to say, we all have to compromise for the changes in the new world of Azeroth and Cataclysm itself. It is well worth it after all the benefits. In addition I have been playing this game since I received my beta discs in 1998. I grow tired of the same world everyday. It's a small place after 11 years. I think this event will be a highlight for all us Wow-heads. In addition we will for once, all be NEWBIES ;)<br />
<br />
By the way Hucklebuck, if you don't like the changes, instead of being ignorant of the situation, overall truly into the furthest depths, analyze the facts, the pros vs. cons, there's also nothing you can do about it, deal with it, then be happy with it. If you like Horde, awesome. We, the Alliance, had been bent over a barrel when you had gotten the awesome Blood Elf, and we got the stupid Draenei. So it's our turn to get something cool, and the Horde to get something not everyone may like.<br />
<br />
I'm not trying to be rude, I just want everyone to look over the term at hands thoroughly with realistic views before posting pessimistic views. <br />
<br />
OH! I also thought I'd throw in here. If no one has clued in yet, which MANY of you probably have... This new expansion is based on the prophesied 2012 malarkey... The planets will align, us being in the level of our nebula having our black hole pull on us in a spiral form will cause natural catastrophe... Meteors will hit, Earthquakes, Mass Floods, Super Tsunami, Hurricanes, Tornadoes, Excessive Volcanic Activity, Etc... Pretty good idea, but I think selling out the 2012 crisis is hitting a bit under the belt (to vulnerable people). Just like 2000 (Y2K) was....</div></div><hr />
