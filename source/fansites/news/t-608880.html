<br />
Near the gates of Ogrimmar, there were Trolls, Orks and Ogers. NO F$CKING MOOH-MOOHS! This crap is totally random, uncalled for and stupid.

<br />
And yes, I know I can farm ZG for a raptormount. Guess who's been going there every week since the instance was released.<br />
<br />
I can live with imbalance (since it mostly is temporary anyways), but crap like this just pisses me off. Been trying to get a special mount since Baron Rivendares mount surfaced and never had any luck with it.<br />
<br />
How about switching ZG mounts over to exalted Zandalar and being buyable with the &quot;trade me in for class specific Zg head enchant&quot; tokens?<br />
<br />
How about giving out Rivendares mount for exalted Argent Dawn and one piece of each armor token (those dropping in Naxx required for the T3 Armor)?<br />
<br />
It's nothing a PvPer or Casual will achieve easily (at least not with BC and soon WOTLK live) and it would show your dedication as a classic WoW Raider.<br />
<br />
I am sick and tired of Alliance mounts and there is NO reason lorewise, why mounts shouldn't be universal after all.<br />
<br />
I don't care how hard it is, I don't care, how long it takes, just implement cross faction mounts that do not rely on having the right lootmaster and raidleader entering the instance at odd angles and in certain order, just to cheat your way to a &quot;lucky loottable&quot;.<br />

<br />
Well, unless they did more nerfing to boss 3 encounter than I could see (slightly reducing damage on two mobs?), then it wasn't much of a change.<br />
<br />
--<br />
As for casuals... casuals can play just as well as you or me, they are just more pressed for time. Generally speaking, casuals don't play the game for the 25-man raids (and therefor do not play it for the 25-man rewards, either). The term &quot;casual&quot; describes time constraints, but is often used as an excuse to victimize a group of people who aren't able to beat the game's challenges.<br />
<br />
If you'll excuse my attitued, I'm just fed up with the &quot;casual&quot; debate.<br />

Anyway, I really wish they'd remove certain gems from the game. They know damn well that there are some stats you should never ever gem for and one of those is Spell Crit rating. You would NEVER in you right mind pick that over any other gem. Pure damage, pure haste, pure hit, or any combination of those will ALWAYS be better. So why have it?

Agreed. But on the other hand, spell pen/spell crit gems are about the only readily available green colour gems useful for casters. At least before spell haste/sta gems were introduced. And I need a green gem on my gear to get my meta gem bonus.</div></div><hr />

The worst change though is the MgT nerf. It may be hard but it makes it even nicer and the drops worth it. Now everyone will have these drops. Anyway, blizz doesn't want to loose it's young players who keep complaining.</div></div><hr />

No, you're just some random scrub who got carried for an offhand weapon. You don't know what the fuck you're talking about. Cheat death was fine, we still got killed through it. Our damage in pvp gear is absolutely horrible due to hit rating/expertise loss, Cloak of Shadows is still broken (Only 4 second effective duration instead of 5), Vanish is still broken, Pets still chase us through stealth 50 yards away, shadowstep is still no intercept, etc, etc...<br />

<br />
OMFG STFU Earlier today me (i'm a rogue) and a fire mage were chasing a druud around eye of the storm and we were chasing him 1 lap around whole eots. I kicked every cast i was able to kick which was just cyclone... nothing else was casted -.- Anyways... we were running around whole EOTS and i kept 5 wound poisons on him all the friggin time and yet he survived for 1 whol lap. Noew don't go saying again that druuds are useless for PvP! They're pretty much best class beside rogue for PvP allthought rogues get nerfed every patch while druuds just get better. And druuds are pretty much rogue exterminators so i suppose you could call them the best PvP class. And i'm not some noob who keeps crying over everything but i just couldn't bare to see a guy writing that druids are useless for PvP lol -.-</div></div><hr />

<br />
Last year we gave the horde our precious rams, which was okay lorewise, since gnomes, dwarves and goblins (not sure about the last ones) were part of the Brewfest next to Ironforge.<br />
<br />
Near the gates of Ogrimmar, there were Trolls, Orks and Ogers. NO F$CKING MOOH-MOOHS! This crap is totally random, uncalled for and stupid. I have 4 chars with enough tokens for the Brewfest mount saved up from last years event, because I really was looking forward to a wolf or a raptor (!!!).<br />
<br />
Way to go keeping the really cool mounts horde exclusive.<br />
<br />
And yes, I know I can farm ZG for a raptormount. Guess who's been going there every week since the instance was released.<br />
<br />
I can live with imbalance (since it mostly is temporary anyways), but crap like this just pisses me off. Been trying to get a special mount since Baron Rivendares mount surfaced and never had any luck with it.<br />
<br />
How about switching ZG mounts over to exalted Zandalar and being buyable with the &quot;trade me in for class specific Zg head enchant&quot; tokens?<br />
<br />
How about giving out Rivendares mount for exalted Argent Dawn and one piece of each armor token (those dropping in Naxx required for the T3 Armor)?<br />
<br />
It's nothing a PvPer or Casual will achieve easily (at least not with BC and soon WOTLK live) and it would show your dedication as a classic WoW Raider.<br />
<br />
I am sick and tired of Alliance mounts and there is NO reason lorewise, why mounts shouldn't be universal after all.<br />
<br />
I don't care how hard it is, I don't care, how long it takes, just implement cross faction mounts that do not rely on having the right lootmaster and raidleader entering the instance at odd angles and in certain order, just to cheat your way to a &quot;lucky loottable&quot;.<br />
<br />
(And don't even start on discussing predefined loot again. We all know there is neither proof for nor against it.)<br />
<br />
<br />
Lol quit yer bitchin' :P who do you think was farming ZG every week to get Swift Zulian Tiger? And to see you alliance get such an imba kodo that looks 70% better than any horde kodos and we get a shitty ram that only looks ok on an undead but ofc thousand more mounts look sooo much better on an undead than a ram so no one is using it anyways lol....</div></div><hr />

If you removed the gems other aspects of the gemming package would change accordingly. Introduce a 11 Heal/5 Crit gem as mentioned earlier that would work wonderfully for a Holy Paladin. That means they'd need to change the meta gem requirements as well. Stop looking at the issue in such a narrow view as removing the gems and not replacing them with reasonable alternatives.</div></div><hr />

<br />
With the exception, that mech-striders have been gnomes and dwarves only for a long long time.<br />
Even the majority of alliance can't ride kodos.<br />
<br />
They did implement the flying mounts as something reputation based with BC. I hope, they will continue that with WOTLK. They even can bring more buttugly bear mounts as timed rewards to the game, since nobody I know wants one of those anyway.<br />
<br />
I just wish, they would go back to the classic content and make some of those ridiculous ~0,01% drop mounts obtainable through hard PvE work. Having a ZG/Strat/Attumen/TdM/druid epic quest mount just means, you got incredibly lucky and also carries the high possibility of you having to switch servers for being called a ninja.<br />

No, YOU won't chose it. Others will. When you can get close to 90% crit chance with buffs and specs it makes for massive amounts of fairly certain burst damage.</div></div><hr />

First off, I didn't get carried for anything. Holy Paladins can't carry rogues to 1850. My partner and I clawed our way to 1920 but unfortunately couldn't manage to break into 1950-2000 before taking a plunge down. After sinking like a lead balloon against countless reroll teams, we haven't bothered to recover the rating with S4 less than a week away. <br />
<br />
Don't bother to pop off based solely on what you see from searching my armory profile, you dimwitted twit, especially when your own ratings (http://www.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Azjol-Nerub&amp;n=Fightinirish) aren't faring any better.</div></div><hr />

Oh I agree, I'd love to have a readily available (craftable, not heroic drop) 11 heal/5 crit gem, but who's being narrow minded here? You're the one who stated in your previous post that pure spell crit gems are utterly useless for anyone when they're clearly not.<br />
<br />
For your information, I have several pure spell crit gems on my pally now, as well as quite a few of the heroic 11 heal/4 spell crit gems. As it is (and as someone has already mentioned), this is the only viable way to go at this point in time for me (5/9 BT), as spell haste doesn't really become a viable route for pally healing until you reach SWP levels of raiding, where quite a bit of the gear has it as a base stat.</div></div><hr />

1) Stormwind should've always had a harbor, lorewise. The fact they're having to build one now is a bit of a retcon.<br />
2) It's actually sitting right by the sea right now. Swim up the coastline from Westfall (to Newman's Landing) or use one of the methods to get &quot;under&quot; Stormwind and you'll see it's directly on the coast. The ocean just isn't visible from inside due to the high walls and the way the textures are set up.</div></div><hr />

Aye it's very close to the sea even and checking the map they have to move a lot of land for it: http://wyrihaximus.net/world-of-warcraft/maps/?lng=-20.4345703125&amp;lat=73.10579967373414&amp;zoom=8 It would have made more sense to me if they placed the entrance between the park and the mage section (then again lore isn't my best bit of the game :)).</div></div><hr />

Added key bindings for tab targeting players.<br />
<br />
What exactly changed?<br />
<br />
<br />
You can now bind a key that will specifically target PLAYERS, instead of NPCs and PLAYERS. Looking at the new slash commands /targetfriendplayer and /targetenemyplayer, we might get a key binding for targetting hostile players and one for targetting friendly players in addition to the ones we already have (target friendly NPC or player + target hostile NPC or player).</div></div><hr />

Do you honestly think druids and shamans are the most overpowered class? If so what are your reasonings, because Druids are a bitch to learn exactly how to play in PvP, especially in arenas. There are bits and pieces you need to learn, it's not just lawllifebloom and run around like a chicken with it's head cut off. And also the only TRULY overpowered shaman is the resto shaman in PvP. If you can play your class correctly you can tear people up with enhancement or elemental. <br />
<br />
If you ask me I believe blizzard should make more PvE changes over PvP. They have multiple PvP changes that have already been implemented, but they need to worry about PvE as well. Since not everyone wants to PvP.</div></div><hr />

Why does everyone think that adding a cast time to shapeshifting wouldn't completely destroy the druid class in general. If that were to happen feral pvp would be non-existent because we would be either slowed or frozen the entire time and never be able to attack a target, especially with the range bug.</div></div><hr />

man... you are the biggest dumbass nub i ve ever heard about...

WTF?!?! you guys can be pretty much immune to meele attacks for 10 seconds, CoS making you immune to magic, Vanish, Shadowstep, Sap, Blind, Gouge, Kidney Shot, Stunlocking, Kick... rogue is the ultimate and most powerfull class in a bleeding arena if the rogue knows how the fuck to play -.-</div></div><hr />

and i think you are another bleeding dumbass... do you know how much mana Moonfire costs? 400+ ... thats improved and 9% - mana cost... i can cast 20 moonfires and im completely outta mana... you think moonfire is OP? T6 mages when they used frostnova can crit 2.2k with Ice Lance -.- and i max crit 1k with moonfire -.- and i dont have Shatter so i dont have 75% crit chance (50% + your own crit)... so stop whining -.- <br />
<br />
... and shape shifting same shit.. as feral i got only mana to.. enter combat, use combat ress if some dumbass fucks up, then back again, then innervate some other dumbass who cant use mana pots, then back again... and im pretty much outta mana... ofc in arena = travel form costs only 300 mana = you are screwed but then again, paladins have the judgement making me go slower -.-, and you still can stop us due to we do still use mana on shapeshifting... <br />
<br />
<br />
though we must be instant in PvE, throw combat ress, and back to moonkin or feral form... or we loose too much DPS..</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Yes druids are over powered. What game have you been playing. Heres how things work in wow.<br />
<br />
Hunters have no escape as long as pvp trinkets exist. I shouldn't have to explain why traps, and aspect of the cheetah and most certainly FD fail at being a reliable escape. But by even listing the weakest class at defence and survivability I tell you havn't played one so let me start by saying traps have a 30 sec CD. If the trap is resisted which is likely or trinketed which is even more likely the hunter dies before that CD is up. Hunters can be targeted on the ground if they FD. Hunters are also dazed when attacked with cheetah up. You don't wing clip and then try to out range a range class and you definitely don't wing clip melee since they will hamstring or poison you.<br />
<br />
For priest its almost expected to have your fear trinkted. Most classes can 1 shot a bubble off a priest since it stops roughly 1.3k dmg. Hunters can just use arcane shot on it and not break a sweat. Your only option is to stand and chain heals on your self and wait for weaken soul to fade so you can get bubble up one more time.<br />
<br />
Mages could get away if they use every cooldown they got. But still if someone wants to kill them like a hunter they wont get far. Ice block? Please... Just gives everyone time to type /lol <br />
<br />
Pally's have a short window they can heal or run. They are delaying the inevitable and don't forget a priest can mass dispel it off with no problems. Take bubble away from them and they have nothing.<br />
<br />
Warlocks have no escape other then fear which can be trinketed out of with no problems. Its kill or be killed.<br />
<br />
Stun a druid you say.. Stun any class preventing them from doing anything and they will die. It’s almost as idiotic as saying hunters do well in BG because no one notices them. Ignore any class and they will do well.</div></div><hr />

brother .. you are ignoring the fact that i gave you more then 1 spell for every class to escape and you are acting like every class has 10 of those trinkets and theres no CD on them... just a thing so you understand my point... Death coil: use trinket... fear... zomg? wtf to do?, and whats the chance on you ALLWAYS have a priest with you when you meet a paladin? dude... you are talking like... a 25 vs 25 battle infront of orgrimmar.. you have all classes ready to pop theyre CCs... <br />
<br />
think abit... you got 2 min CD least on your trinket... use once you got sapped, and then you get poisoned, blinded, gouged, kicked, kidney shotted... ooh well you got 10 trinkets right? GL ...</div></div><hr />

Brother..The comparison that’s going completely over your head druids don't need to worry about anyone trinketing out of anything or resisting. It is a reliable escape. Druids can shift forms to break different types of impairing effects and still have a trinket. And no one will catch you other then a rogue that blows his CD or someone on a mount or a warriors intercept and hamstring, Oh but wait you can shape shift out of the effect..<br />
<br />
Your scenario using a rogues abilities as an argument hardly lacks weight since any class is subject to those types of cc. It only takes one use of a trinket followed by a shape shift. Not 10. <br />
<br />
As far as pally's go I pvp with a priest and even when I'm not on it I see bubbles getting dispelled off often. Even if there is no priest whats to stop me from running right behind the pally till be bubble fades? He runs just as fast as I do. Why are druids diffrent? Then can escape using a ability that has nothing more then a GCD that can not be dispelled off.<br />
<br />
No one should need to explain to you why druids are considered OP unless you have never played the game. Maybe not as OP as rogues but to damn close for anyone to have the nerve to defend them.</div></div><hr />

And no one will catch you other then a rogue that blows his CD or someone on a mount or a warriors intercept and hamstring, Oh but wait you can shape shift out of the effect..<br />
<br />
Your scenario using a rogues abilities as an argument hardly lacks weight since any class is subject to those types of cc. It only takes one use of a trinket followed by a shape shift. Not 10. <br />
<br />
As far as pally's go I pvp with a priest and even when I'm not on it I see bubbles getting dispelled off often. Even if there is no priest whats to stop me from running right behind the pally till be bubble fades? He runs just as fast as I do. Why are druids diffrent? Then can escape using a ability that has nothing more then a GCD that can not be dispelled off.<br />
<br />
No one should need to explain to you why druids are considered OP unless you have never played the game. Maybe not as OP as rogues but to damn close for anyone to have the nerve to defend them.<br />
<br />
<br />
i play a druid just first of all... 2nd... Paladins = Hammer of justice, Warlock, X % chance to stun with a SB, Mage can do some stun effect as well.... druids cant shape shift outta Repentence, neither HoJ, neither Kidney Shot, Neither Intimidating Shout, Fear, all kinda stuns (many classes .. most classes has stun...) <br />
<br />
the paladin if hes ret, he both has Repentence and HoJ after the bubble + the bubble gives him time to have like an SS = fill hes hp up. ...<br />
<br />
my point is.. .use a bleeding stun, fear effect and tada no troubles with druids... least CD is used... now stop whining... btw hunters can sleep and fear druids. another reason to stop QQ... if you are jealouz of the class.. become a druid. thoguh i wouldnt advise... since we are the most hated class for not being able to be a pure of anything<br />
<br />
... not the best tank, not the best healer, not the best Meele and not the best casting DPS... we are all around shit, the fact that i will never tank illidan, never top a dmg meters in a fight vs illidan, never will be the best healer withotu having 90% overheal... it sickens me.. and all you can talk about is that you get out runned away by a fucking druid?...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hunters stun too if spec'ed. And no druids can't get out of it, and I never said they could. Other then warriors and pally's other classes stuns are based on chance. Snares and dazes druids can shape shift out of and they are considers CC. No other class can without blowing a CD. Pvp is heavly dependent on CC and giving a class a edge goes a long way.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
the paladin if hes ret, he both has Repentence and HoJ after the bubble + the bubble gives him time to have like an SS = fill hes hp up. ...<br />
<br />
Even though this goes off the topic of escaping, druids once successfully out of combat can hide heal and drink. Paladin never gets a chance to regain mana and still has enemies standing waiting to kill him. He never escaped which pretty much doesn't address the topic of the argument.<br />
<br />

<br />
Stuns use CD's or are based on chance. Druids have no CD 100% reliable. I can stun any class. Saying I can stun a druid doesn't give me evidence that druids are not OP compared to other classes. Hunters can fear druids? No wai! Ever hear of a druid coming out of form? Why do you think the hunters where upset when blizzard removed instant cast off of fear beast at the last minute. Even as it stands a druid in travel form puts 30 yards on the hunter before fear gets casted since the hunter has to stand still to cast. Also arguing hunters counter to druids is a deep survival spec that hardly anyone play’s in pvp which has a 2min CD is grossly imbalanced if you consider it a druid counter.<br />

<br />
<br />
I use druid tanks and healers in pve and they do fine. There are different applications where they do better then others. The fact that they CAN do everything is why we bring them to raids and also opens many windows for exploit in pvp. But I guess I'm suppose to feel bad for you because you think your class sucks at pve even though you can pull off tanking, dps, and healing and some how deserve to be set on a pedestal above others in pvp. Say hi to the paladin class, which can tank, heal and do ok dps. Sound familar? And some how are not considered by anyone OP in pvp. You don't have another toon by the name kulgan would you?</div></div><hr />

lovely words... i seek as well a world where more team play = more and better epix... <br />

i miss the times where with PvP gear you would still meet someone with the Ashbringer and run away... the times where Epic wasnt free... the time we had to sweat and the time we raided for real fun... <br />
<br />
PvP ruins the game... allowing players to buy items for PvE trough killing a bunch of nubs... then they join PvE with theyre PvP crap... and they dont know a shit about threat, nor CD and max DPS, they run and jump behind and infront of the mob... thinking its a player and you could escape the attacks...<br />
<br />
PvP = Sucks now a days... i wish Honor was handed out to the stupids... i wish we were in the old system... where if you were a Player killer... a Warlord... you needed to actually become one.. and maintain the career as it was... that was what a Warlord was...</div></div><hr />

Just check this http://www.sk-gaming.com/arena/player<br />
<br />
If your 2 lazy to open yourself ill write it here..<br />
<br />
29% of the people playing arena currently in 2v2 are druids, thereafter we have rogues at 21, warriors at 15, priest 12, mage 11, shaman 5, warlock 5, paladin 2.<br />
<br />
According to those numbers druids are heavily overpopulated, do you think that's just a coincidence? I dont</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ishy</div><div class="date">2008-07-09, 09:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok so now i would like to ask to all those Druids all around the world fearing for nerf ...<br />
Get a look on sk gaming what is the first class to get 2000+ rating ??? have a guess ... Druids (in 2c2)<br />
What was the most played class in 2000+ bracket season 3 ???? have a guess Druids (in 2v2) and the less played class of all paladin <br />
Now are you going to tell me that druid players are more skilled ??? So there would be a skill pack sent to you by mail just because you rerolled a druid ??? <br />
Druids are OP that s the point admit it ... I m not a Big pvp player a didn t manage to get over 1990 in 2c2 playing war paly (we didn t have hard time vs druid war because under 2100 war druids are just to damn stupid but they still manage to get at this rating playing like noobs)<br />
I just want to say that with equal skill level druids get further in PvP than any other healer <br />
And no i m not going to reroll druid i still have some dignity...<br />
<br />
PS: sorry for my english i m used with french <br />
<br />
<br />
Yeah druids are really strong in 2v2, but less so in the 3v3 bracket where more arena points are and all the tournaments are held in. There they are equal to priests fex. <br />
But I do agree holy paladins could use a minor buff. But many classes/ specs could use a minor buff currently.</div></div><hr />

Does anybody else feel cheated with the Brewfest Kodo mount?<br />
<br />
Last year we gave the horde our precious rams, which was okay lorewise, since gnomes, dwarves and goblins (not sure about the last ones) were part of the Brewfest next to Ironforge.<br />
<br />
Near the gates of Ogrimmar, there were Trolls, Orks and Ogers. NO F$CKING MOOH-MOOHS! This crap is totally random, uncalled for and stupid. I have 4 chars with enough tokens for the Brewfest mount saved up from last years event, because I really was looking forward to a wolf or a raptor (!!!).<br />
<br />
Way to go keeping the really cool mounts horde exclusive.<br />
<br />
<br />
lets see<br />
alliance gets hawkstriders, horde gets nothing.<br />
alliance gets winterspring frostsaber, horde gets nothing.<br />
alliance can get an undead horse via deathcharger, horde can get a ram (although slightly easier).<br />
<br />
where's the &quot;really cool mounts being horde exclusive&quot; here? i would love to get my own frostsaber.<br />
You just want every mount available ingame. go zg and get your raptor if you really want one.</div></div><hr />

I hear you on that, PvP is killin the game itself, who the hell cares about someone getting a 2000+ rating? Not me, not the hardcore PvE'ers... Get over it people, PvP is ruining this game, they should go back to the 14 rank honor system where you had to do something to get gear instead of 1 day of PvP for a season 2 weapon.</div></div><hr />

Its a broken class? You mean broken spec aka feral which is getting addressed already for the next expansion. I would agree pvp shouldn't ruin pve but if your going to argue resto druids are broken since you mention class your asking for your post to be torn in pieces. Travel form could use a daze when attacked which would balance the whole class in today’s mechanics but that wont happen. What will happen is there will be a attempt in a fix that will come in the next expansion through buffs. No body will realize druids have been balanced.</div></div><hr />

No but just like a hunter gets dazed when struck in cheetah I would expect the same for travel form. Will that effect pve? No and there are mounts available that you can afford at 70 easly.</div></div><hr />

Or a mana nar drainable even in cat or bear form or no mana bar no passive regen ... or less mp5 on pvp gear<br />
(in my entire wow arena life i ve never seen a druid so much OOM he can't heal ... those bitchs can always cast at least a lifebloom )<br />
I m not asking for mutch just a balance that would give over class a chance ... and about the druid not being that effective in 3v3 :o ever heard of Druid Rogue Rogue Druid War Demo Druid War Ret Druid War Mage ...

<br />
completely agree but ... slightly different... NERF ALL THE FUCKING PVP GEAR...<br />
<br />
god damn it im being forced to become PvP just so i can do more DPS output in PvE? ... WTF is that... why do i need to become PvP just so i can do more dps in PvE? i find it STUPID, <br />
i find it crazy that warriors have an excuse to use PvP gear in PvE...<br />
<br />
simply, remove most of the crit and AP from the gear and Mp5, and let ressilence be the only thing really worthy in PvP gear... <br />
<br />
then theres no debate, PvPers wont be able to do alot of PvE and still do 2k DPS at illidan with bleeding PVP gear, and PvErs wont need to do arena and stay outta PvP to get better PVE gear... <br />
<br />
i think i got a plan, gona make a PVP guild and make them all get full brutals then we go and do illidan with pure PvP gear, and ofc just give abit T6 to the MT and Tada... !<br />
<br />
one more thing... Ressilence is better to have as feral tank then defense now adays... since you need less resillence to be crit immune then defense... -.- extraordinary...</div></div><hr />

<br />
I want to add warriors also use their pvp spec for pve spec aka arms. <br />
<br />
Anyways so lets remove stats from pvp gear. What pve gear are you going to replace it with? You're wearing it for a reason and I suspect replacing it with pve gear would be a down grade. To a lot of raiders that went and did arena just to get that pvp substitute to fill in the missing gaps in their gear might be upset your striping them of their hard work. I also think its to late to remove the gear or severely nerf it at this point unless you could think of a way to reward those that worked since you can not give back the time they spent trying to get it. <br />
<br />
Btw, You wont get past p2 if your healers are wearing pvp gear. Its OP gear but not that OP.</div></div><hr />

PVE gear can easily do more DPS than a PVP<br />

if this happens there wont be any fun in pvp and alot of ppl like me will quit the game , cuz only pvp is holding me.<br />
