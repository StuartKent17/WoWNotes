<br />
Hello, and welcome to Artcraft! I’m Chris Robinson, senior art director on World of Warcraft, and in today’s edition we’re going to give you a first look at the new female Night Elf model. As you probably know, we’re in the process of updating all of the original character models, along with the Draenei and Blood Elf, to improve their texture, polygon, and animation fidelity. Let’s get this going with some comments from Tyson Murphy, our lead character artist.<br />
<br />
Hi all—I’m Tyson, and on behalf of everyone on the art team, we’re excited to be able to give you a first look at our in-progress female Night Elf model.<br />
<br />
This is a good opportunity to talk about the iterative process we go through with all of the art we create, especially with the updated player models. We don’t call anything truly “complete” until it’s in the game and fulfilling all of our (and your!) expectations. This means that when it comes to concept art, modeling, texturing, rigging, and animation, everything is always up for debate and change, and we’re rethinking and revising continuously. Creating these updated models is a huge team effort, and we’re constantly considering feedback and suggestions on what we can do better. We’ve committed ourselves to this process, and the female Night Elf provided a unique opportunity to put it into practice.<br />
<br />
The female Night Elf was actually one of the first models we started, but as we began to develop our other character models, we also wound up refining the overall look we were going for with the models and our processes for creating them. Ultimately, we felt that in order to do the female Night Elf justice, we needed to revisit her model with fresh eyes and continue iterating based on what we’d learned from working on the other models. The Night Elves have such a distinct but subtle character, and we spent a lot of effort in trying to help that come through.<br />
<br />
As with all of the updated character models, our goal is to keep everything the original model accomplished intact, while using the additional fidelity to realize characteristics that we weren’t able to fully represent with the lower polygon counts and texture resolutions. Overall, we’ve made her new model a little more defined, made some of her proportions a bit more realistic, and added a bit more muscle tone. We wanted to visually communicate that she is a fully capable warrior huntress, and small details like muscle definition help highlight that. We also put additional focus on her hands and fingernails, giving a very slight point to her nails to provide just a hint of a more feral nature.<br />
<br />
Last but not least, the all-important Night Elf ears. In the original model, these were quite literally separate pieces of geometry effectively tacked onto the head of the Night Elf. In the new models, we’ve taken care to fully integrate the ears into the geometry, which leads to a far more natural and high-quality look.<br />
<br />
I’ve asked Tamara Bakhlycheva, who also worked on the female Night Elf model, to add a few closing thoughts.<br />
<br />
Hi all, I’m Tamara from the World of Warcraft art team. Being able to work on the female Night Elf has been a great experience, and the team has put a lot of effort into preserving the iconic Night Elf look—beautiful, wild, and dangerous. I hope you’ll enjoy playing your new Night Elf as much as we’ve enjoyed creating her.<br />
<br />
Chris here again; thanks for reading, and we look forward to sharing more about the ongoing process of bringing the art of Warlords of Draenor—and beyond—to life. Thanks!</div></div><hr />

Look at what the old model's equivalent of that face is. That one has the dark lip colour, and has always had it. Other faces will not have it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No real world human stands like that. She's an elf. If they want <br />
to say she walks with her nipples, then they can...<br />
<br />
The lack of fangs is gonna bug me for a while though. (Despite the rest <br />
of the teeth looking great.)</div></div><hr />

It's a common resource/time saving thing in games. Most human models lack canines as well. It's a lot easier to make a single &quot;tooth&quot; and then just copy across the mouth, unless the model calls for much more obvious things like tusks.</div></div><hr />

It's fairly safe to say however that fangs has been fairly prominent feature of NE in all sorts of things for a long time and skipping on them seems uninformed at best, lazy at worst.</div></div><hr />

Well, they'll have to change it, because a Night Elf without fangs is like a Draenei without a tail or facial tentacles. It wouldn't be acceptable to let her go to live like that just for the sake of cutting corners, and I tweeted about it. :b</div></div><hr />

Apparently Night Elfs stand like that... and last time I checked they aren't real so... yeah.<br />

Most human models lack canines as well. It's a lot easier to make a single &quot;tooth&quot; and then just copy across the mouth, unless the model calls for much more obvious things like tusks.<br />
<br />
Yeah, but that's not really valid, because our canines don't usually stand out any more than the rest of our teeth. Not so with the night elves. <br />
<br />
Other than that, though, I think it's fantastic.</div></div><hr />

They're pretty understated in most of the art I can find. I don't disagree that it's lazy, but it's also something tough to notice in most situations.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The tattoos don't really require much of an update. They're a simple overlay on the skin. The idea is to show the base face. The tattoos will still be an option, and likely look pretty much identical to now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Face looks great, I do especially love the shades of the cheek. Lip shape and eye shape is really well executed and ah, it just couldn't have gotten any better! <br />
<br />
The only con thing I can come up with the face, is my personal taste of when they open their mouth, gaping... The lips... They look so weird, I saw that in the gnome update too, it really feels like a fish mouth or something - except that - splendid work! Every little detail, thought that is put into this is just overwhelming!<br />
<br />
Smaller breasts and bigger legs (thighs) was a minus from my opinion. Rest is great.</div></div><hr />

I want to see the animations! That's when we'll really see something new.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The one thing that really stands out now that we're looking at much more detailed models is the fact that the lack of irises is severely limiting the model's ability to express emotions and personality. It's a shame really, but I'm guessing it's kind of hard to do anything about the Night Elf eyes. I really think they should make the Draenei eyes non-glowing but with glowing irises though, just like they're portrayed in the TBC cinematic. It would really add a lot of personality and breathe life into the model.<br />
<br />
Nevertheless, I think they did the Night Elf female justice. She's looking a bit more mature this time around, with a touch of &quot;timelessness&quot;, and the level of muscle definition helps to bring out her feral nature without turning her into something really non-feminine (referring to the scrapped version again). I really think that they should give her her fangs back though.</div></div><hr />

With ya on that one. I'm not sure why they're so against making the models as savage/wild as the concept art, particularly since they have Blood Elves now, so the need to have pretty/girly elves being forced upon the Night Elves is gone.</div></div><hr />

They should have fangs. Currently female Night Elves don't have any teeth at all when they open their mouths (most likely because of graphic restrictions) but Tyrande has an upgraded model and she has fangs in her mouth. Also, the current, low-res Night Elf Males have fangs.</div></div><hr />

Are you trolling or are you actually this clueless?<br />
<br />
Blizzard said all along, before they even started showing us these new models, that the designs would.not.change. That they were bringing the classic looks and races up to Pandaren levels of detail without changing the designs. They've said this again and again and again. <br />
<br />

The older model had a decently proportionate face, other than the large mouth. The newer model now has eyes even bigger than the large mouth. They don't even look like eyes anymore. They look like hollowed out eye sockets with balls of light inside, similar to that of a jack-o-lantern.<br />

The night elf eyes in the original cinematic also only glow on the irises and look really good that way. It also looks like the blood elf eyes are the same way in the BC cinematic.</div></div><hr />

If you can't tell the difference in those models, you probably need an eye exam. There is exponentially more detail head to toe, in both the mesh itself and the textures.<br />
<br />
Ugh. I cannot stand comments like this. Its one thing to say 'I dislike the design' but to say there's no technical difference is just uninformed stupidity.<br />
<br />
Go up to a blue-ray player and say 'meh, its exactly the same as VHS back in the 80s'. That's about as accurate as saying there's no improvement/difference in these models.</div></div><hr />

They're not going to restrict us to one single face, this is the &quot;base&quot; skin, they'll make the alternatives after they finalize the model, you can do wonders with textures and normal/bump maps.

Night Elven women are not dainty human nobles. They are amazons who will snipe you with a bow from a thousand meters, or gut you up front despite wielding the dumbest weapon in the game's universe. Sophisitication, delicacy... do you even play this game, asshole?</div></div><hr />

The upgrade itself is great. It is very true to the original model. I just hate that face, both the original and the new one, and I hate the fact that my character will continue to look that way.

Her eyes got bigger in the new model, the face is smoother, with a very light definition to the cheekbones. The only one that's maybe valid is the nose, and I'm 99% certain that's all shading that's making it seem more prominent.</div></div><hr />

but now these eyes look straight, not asian like! and nose is much bigger, not to mention cheekbones. she looks as if someone hammered a brick to her face.

Not only that this class will be a more spot healing class but still melee range so when raiding healing they will be dashing across the map kicking allies and enemies alike, their big healing cooldown will transform them into a multi-legged monster that goes around launching a series of kicks to everyone around them, healing them with the power of negative reinforcement. It's DPS cooldown will transform them into nothing but legs making them duplicate all of their abilities as they perform two kicks at once.</div></div><hr />

Fangs I agree with, but I think they'll add those, given the fact that there's already been this many people talking about it. Iris I agree with, but I didn't see that one happening anyway. The darkened eyelids just seem like that belongs to that face. We'll have to see what happens with that.<br />

Uh, no. Stop bringing up bodybuilding, that has nothing to do with anything. Bodybuilders focus on a few muscles groups at a time so they get bulky, and oftentimes have problems with range of movement and joint stability because they focus on hypertrophy. Someone who is non-stop moving/fighting/hauling heavy weaponry around is not going to be looking like a bodybuilder, their body is going to adapt so that they can move more easily with the demands put on it. Everything about this model is what a lean muscled female body looks like (stylistic choices like the wonky abs aside).</div></div><hr />

Sorry, but no. It's not even comparable. They prettied up a static 3D model, which anyone can do. Creating a face with complex animations is in a completely different ballpark. <br />
<br />
And as for Wildstar...uggh, you cannot compare WoW to a brand new game. These new models have to be implemented into a decade-old engine. And in spite of that, it looks damn good. You are a perfect example of someone just complaining for the sake of complaining.</div></div><hr />

Body building of this type can be done all naturally. It doesn't require anything except perhaps a protein heavy diet and workouts.<br />

workout is quite a new thing. in old times, of course were 'bodybuilders' of old but it was a rare thing. muscles came from work and necessary training. obtaining muscles for visuals is rather new. I think that nelf females have other, more important things to do than workout.<br />

I think, it is quite the opposite. People do not throw it enough.<br />
<br />
they aren't, and to me such body is atrocious, she looks like a shemale after poor hormone therapy.<br />
<br />
And a tiny bit of toning and muscle, and she's the hulk now?<br />
<br />
Ok...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Immitis</div><div class="date">2014-05-13, 10:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">workout is quite a new thing. in old times, of course were 'bodybuilders' of old but it was a rare thing. muscles came from work and necessary training. obtaining muscles for visuals is rather new. I think that nelf females have other, more important things to do than workout.<br />
<br />
noted, you fail to see. too wide.<br />
<br />
this is also bullshit. <br />
<br />
&quot;working out&quot; is not new. pretty much all the exercises people do now have always been done only now we do it for cosmetic reasons instead of necessity</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">blacklamb</div><div class="date">2014-05-13, 10:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">no. stop focusing on anything that is irrelevant. this is a body manufactured through bodybuilding. please, do yourself a favour and check bodies of females to train archery, fencing, acrobacy. healthy majority of them do not look this way. such ripped body is unobtainable through natural processes, in case of nelves: fighting and traveling through forests<br />
<br />
I refuted you with facts, you just keep repeating the same thing over and over again. You know it's ok to be wrong once in a while, right? No one is going to hold it against you. It's perfectly fine to have your own tastes, but calling that &quot;natural&quot; over what really is natural and healthy is damaging and plain fucked up.<br />

you either lie on purpose or are hell bend on 'winning an argument', firstly with showing winnick in armour and saying its the sam ebody - HA HA. and then, well, now, you are speaking abou t the exercises in the past. even when you look at guide books for knights, you will not find modern workout exercises because they were not necessary. when you train your arm for shovel, you do with shovel, not a rock. when you train swordhand you do itw ith sword, not a log<br />

Also guys... seriously she is too muscular? You have no idea what tall and in-shape women look like. Go hang out with some collegian volleyball or swim girls; honestly the new model isn't ripped enough for the lore prowess of NE women. They are said to be more dangerous than the men ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
oh and somebody posted a large woman. there are many levels of muscles, but it does not make elves look like bodybuilder roid.<br />
<br />
<br />
You're clearly talking out of your ass. Because if you had any knowledge at all about this topic, you would know that she does not fall into the bodybuilder category. At best, she's could sign up for either Bikini Fitness, Atlhetic Fitness or maybe Body Fitness. If this model were a real life person, and she'd signed up for Womens Physique, she would be to small. Not to mention the mockery if she would sign up for Classic Bodybuilding...</div></div><hr />

I was worried they'd keep the rest of the model updates under wraps to add more content to Blizzcon.<br />
<br />
I appreciate them trying to maintain a very similar look and feel of the old models, I had to look twice at the female night elf model.<br />
They're keeping the silhouettes very much the same.<br />
<br />
This makes me worry though, my issues with the male night elf model were that the silhouette was dreadfully proportioned and their movements looked awkward.<br />
The male cast animation looks very diminutive in my opinion for such a proud race.<br />
The walking animation looks very rough, their hips merely rotating back and forth but not rising and falling.<br />
Also, am I the only person that feels the extremity length of night elf males looks off?</div></div><hr />
