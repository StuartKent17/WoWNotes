First of all, Dodge and Parry were removed almost 2 years ago. Secondly, I don't see a mess. I see the complete opposite. Its nice for them to clean it up and make it a little less like a spreadsheet. I'm sure any stats they haven't put on there will be added later. It is alpha after all.</div></div><hr />

Dodge and parry removed 2 years ago? Are you legit retarded? Are you even playing the same game as us?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, because it takes SUCH intellect to read the character info pane on Live. Do tell, how few braincells must one have to even start believing that it's in any way complex?<br />
You still get the same info for every stat when you mouse over it. All they've done is clean up the interface and make it look better.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I guess I just count removal of the stat from items as something unnecessary to count on the state pane. Don't think that makes me retarded.<br />
<br />
Check WoWWiki.</div></div><hr />

Here is your yearly 4x50 wins to get in arena and your yearly 4x50 wins to get in RBG to get the same rewards. Can't say I'm not disappointed at the moment.<br />
<br />
Also, if there is no &quot;advanced&quot; character stats, showing like movement speed, this will be likely hated by a lot and rage will happen. Neutral about this atm.</div></div><hr />

I personally like it. Now you only see what you need to see of the stats and if some stat is missing, heck could be a bug. They can fix it.<br />
What even is the need for such a complicated stat menu anyway? Whether you are dumb or not, it still can be hard to figure out and there was a ton of unneeded stats showing up anyway</div></div><hr />

<br />
As per usual, people confuse quantity with quality and complexity, or just bitch and whine for the sake of doing so. I can't imagine ANYONE sitting and going &quot;Hmm...this makes for some real engaging gameplay and complexity!&quot; at the character info window before it became clear that it has changed...<br />
<br />
And indeed, if stats relevant to your class/spec are missing, just report it. I'm checking over my characters on Alpha and if I see a stat missing which is relevant, I'll let Blizzard know.</div></div><hr />

The thing is, why even change it to begin with? There is literally no point in changing this, the old one works fine. They are pretty much just changing stupid shit for the sake of changing something.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not anything worth noting in a character overview. I'm sure they'll add a detail view for those truly interested in their chance to dodge, parry, and who wish to stare at their movement speed.<br />
<br />
And they will probably add dodge/parry to the relevant classes only.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So now your 4-year old cousin suddenly understands what the stats mean, which ones he needs to prioritize depending on the character he's going to play and all that jazz?<br />
<br />
Give me a break...<br />
<br />
Also, for information's sake: Stats show up in the information depending on whether you have items with those stats equipped or not. My hunter has a versatility trinket, so I see haste, mastery, critical strike and versatility in her info. My shaman only has crit and mastery items, so I only see those in his character info.</div></div><hr />

Give him time. For now, menus. Then, eventually, even further simplified stats - not to mention pretty much all he'd get are items suitable, even if not BiS, for his class, so it should be fine either way. And soon, the 2-3 button rotations and he'll be set.</div></div><hr />

I don't know what game you're playing, but I see no 2-3 button rotations on the Alpha. <br />

This. At this pace gear won't even have stats in the expansion after legion. All gear in the game will just have an item level number and everything else will be hidden.</div></div><hr />

I agree, it was a bit of hyperbole. 3-4 abilities. Better?</div></div><hr />

<br />
However, sometimes good feedback gets so bogged down in hyperbole that it’s hard for us to tell if the point you’re making is based on actual concerns and testing, or if you’ve just been misinformed. For example, one complaint we see a lot is that “classes only have 5 or 6 spells in Legion.” That’s simply not true – as of this post, most specs have between 20 and 25 baseline abilities, with talents, Honor talents, and your Artifact active skill adding up to 5-10 abilities on top of that (and yes, we recognize that not all of those skills will be useful in all situations).<br />
<br />
Not that I was ever one to think that number of abilities &gt; synergy of abilities, but apparently that is the case for a lot of you people prone to hyperbole.</div></div><hr />

Oh, I haven't been called for Alpha, so it's not on personal experience - merely stuff I pick up here and there. Some classes now have really basic rotations on Live. <br />
If, to that, we add further trimming and pruning... only natural to assume basic rotations will get even more basic.<br />
<br />
And let us not pretend that Blizzard isn't making WoW simpler by the expansion. Good or bad, subjective.</div></div><hr />

Funny how that goes. I am on the alpha, and as I've said, I have yet to see this simplicity which would allow a 4-year old to excell. And those &quot;basic rotations&quot; still don't help anyone to excell beyond his/her personal capability, so I wouldn't worry about that either.<br />

Same old fanboy argument just keeps getting repeated.<br />
<br />
Just because one small part of the game is hard dosen't mean the overall game isn't getting simpler. You are just cherry picking 1 tiny aspect that suits your argument but ignoring the remaining 98%.</div></div><hr />

Did you just tried arguing that the following statement is false: &quot;Blizzard is making WoW simpler by the expansion&quot;?<br />
I got no words.. Embrace the ignorance! Don't expect me to go with ya though :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just because one small part of the game is hard dosen't mean the overall game isn't getting simpler. You are just cherry picking 1 tiny aspect that suits your argument but ignoring the remaining 98%.<br />
<br />
And the remaining 98% was hard/difficult when...? Not to mention the fact that we're discussing class complexity here, which translates into performance.<br />

You could always give examples on how your claims are true, because I sure as hell don't have an easier time &quot;winning&quot; at the game now than say, 3 expansions ago.</div></div><hr />

For example, one complaint we see a lot is that “classes only have 5 or 6 spells in Legion.” That’s simply not true – as of this post, most specs have between 20 and 25 baseline abilities, with talents, Honor talents, and your Artifact active skill adding up to 5-10 abilities on top of that (and yes, we recognize that not all of those skills will be useful in all situations).<br />
<br />
Not that I was ever one to think that number of abilities &gt; synergy of abilities, but apparently that is the case for a lot of you people prone to hyperbole.<br />
<br />
The problem I have is they handed out accounts to people they *knew* were simply going to stream for marketing reasons. You forfeit any right to complain when you say &quot;go talk about this product!&quot; and people talk about it in a way you don't like. I say forfeit -- I'm using THAT in a hyperbolic manner. You just won't get any sympathy from me. Either they need to admit they were fools for being so silly with handing out testing accounts... or suck it up and stop whining like a child and accept the fact that they, too, can be farmed for money as well.<br />

It's a two-way street, butter cup. Don't like it? Don't offer up accounts.</div></div><hr />

I'd say the point is that the people claiming there's 5-6 abilities or even less, are wrong. <br />
Whether Blizzard has a &quot;right&quot; to complain when they gave Alpha to public people KNOWN to profit from hyperbole and drama, is a different beast.</div></div><hr />

That moment when the Loading Screen representation of a Death knight have a much better/cooler Rune Sword than the vast majority of the Unholy Artifact weapons. BAH! <br />

Let's take Reforging as an example. Did it or didn't it add a layer to the game and was removed? Hence, simplified. <br />
Whether or not it was a good move, in this context, it's irrelevant. <br />
<br />
Another one? Introduction of QoL systems like LFD and LFR. Did these simplify the grouping methods, compared to what we used to have before? <br />

This really sucks, especially focussing on iLevel so much; even more so as it shows Overall iLevel, and not equipped (unless you hover the mouse over it ). :/<br />
<br />
Dodge, Parry, Speed, Leech, and all those are important to some extents. <br />
<br />
Heck even the Sub rogue artifact has a trait that adds more dodge. It's silly they're not showing them, as it even takes more work to not show them. <br />

I'll grant that those things simplify ASPECTS of the game, they don't remove the aspects that still don't benefit from these systems however. <br />
<br />
Reforging was just a UI feature that allowed one to change stats to something more beneficial, plenty of people argued it was making gearing simpler by making every piece of gear a potential upgrade. I never thought it made things simpler nor did it make things more complex or harder, it was just a part of the gearing process.</div></div><hr />

I didn't specify. Each expansion is simplifying something. That's all there was to my statement. <br />

Simplifying != easy-mode babey; Nor does it equate to bad or better changes. Namely the QoL grouping tools, some hate it, some love it, etc.</div></div><hr />

Focussed means just that, it's Larger, bolder, and takes up the majority of the space for stats. It draws the eye to it, and sadly it shows overall iLevel and not your equipped one.<br />

I count 5. With talents and Artifact, it could land at 10 abilities making up the part of your combat rotation if numbers are your big thing.<br />

Three active abilities, two CDs. Uninteresting CDs too, why they say they wanted to consolidate CDs into one interesting button and then gave BM a bloatware CD like Aspect of the Wild I'll never understand.<br />
<br />
And no, I'm not saying numbers are all that. I thought Arcane was fine back when it was basically just Arcane Blast (the mana management times) because the whole spec had depth because of mana.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So it's easier to read = focus is now on ilvl?<br />
I agree that it should show equipped ilvl as well, but other than that the fact still stands that focusing on ilvl is already a thing depending on the player even with the ilvl text being between other info. For example the MM hunter with 740 ilvl boasting in Warspear about his ilvl compared to &quot;the plebs&quot;, whilst his highest stat is mastery since he's only focused on ilvl and not stats...<br />

And one of those CD's works in synergy with Dire Beast, meaning you'll have far more uptime of that CD come Legion than in WOD if you play correctly.<br />
Aspect of the Wild sucks, that I agree with. The idea for BW however is one I like, they just need to tune the spec as a whole.</div></div><hr />

I know it does. But they could've made BW also give some focus regen, ditch that worthless crit (10% on a cooldown? what?), and make the cooldown reduction of BW more interesting than just giving you a little more damage every time you reset it.</div></div><hr />

Agree 100%. I really wish they'd at least kept the reduction of focus cost that BW has right now, at least. Going from resource management to resource waiting doesn't feel all that good. Chimera shot helps but it doesn't solve the issue.</div></div><hr />

Movement speed is missing, weapon damage is missing, health is missing (without mousover), avoidance is missing, equipped ilvl is missing.. It's pretty bad, and they could've solved it by just including an &quot;advanced character panel&quot; toggle.

<br />
Health is still there, Stamina, and the character portrait shows the full number if the character info is open (if one like me has percentage toggled, otherwise you always see it on the character). Weapon damage is shown on the actual weapon. <br />
<br />
Movement speed is a bit odd but I can't say I ever paid heed to it, avoidance on my warrior when in Prot spec is shown under critical strike (parry) and mastery (block). Could be a bug that they're not shown as their own stats, or Blizzard just counts on people giving a shit about these stats finding where their values are at.<br />
<br />
And again, some stats only show if you have items with said stats equipped. No need for a hunter to see spirit, for example.<br />

Whether Blizzard has a &quot;right&quot; to complain when they gave Alpha to public people KNOWN to profit from hyperbole and drama, is a different beast.<br />
<br />
But that's the thing. I don't care if they are right or wrong. They have no interest other than themselves. Blizzard, however, wanted to use them specifically for free marketing.</div></div><hr />

I am expecting they take such a long ass time to complete with the &quot;garrison&quot; table that any normal raider would acquire epics at a faster rate, but still tho, I can picture people already running their asses off to get these items before raid time.<br />

I was expecting a whole new pvp system, we get the exact same thing with timed rewards. Here is your yearly 4x50 wins to get in arena and your yearly 4x50 wins to get in RBG to get the same rewards. Can't say I'm not disappointed at the moment.<br />
<br />
You get prestige levels and with that you get new weapon skins, a new portrait icon, mounts and more. And obviously you get more honor talents, so yes it's a whole new pvp system.</div></div><hr />

Just because one small part of the game is hard dosen't mean the overall game isn't getting simpler. You are just cherry picking 1 tiny aspect that suits your argument but ignoring the remaining 98%.<br />
<br />
I've seen more than one blue post over the years which declare that this is WoWs game design philisophy -- straightforward to become proficient creating a low barrier to entry for new players; significantly more challenging to truly master at the highest difficulty level. If you don't want that gaming experience, then WoW is the wrong game for you. It's okay if that is the case, but no amount of whining or lobbying is likely to change their underlying design goal. There are plenty of other games that ramp up difficulty much faster and apply it too much larger amounts of content.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Class changes I don't agree with is a different matter. Those things took interest in your class and wanting to play it properly. Changing those things didn't suddenly make performance on those classes a faceroll thing for everyone to excell at though. There's still a clearcut difference between people having the interest and putting in the effort in playing their class, and those that do not. There's still a world of difference between those progressing Mythic right now, to those that killed it world first. <br />

That's my problem with it as well. I don't mind that they removed some unnecessary stats. Why would you need to see how much agility or strength you have as a mage? Or anything under the &quot;defenses&quot; subsection we currently have? <br />

<br />
&quot;These changes make item level the most important stat! Wah wah wah!&quot; <br />
<br />
Do you even play the same game as I? Item level has been the most important stat for several expacs now for casuals. When you can't queue for a Heroic dungeon or LFR, what is it that the dungeon finder tells you is too low? Item level. When someone's spamming LFM in Trade/LookingForGroup, what is it they're asking for? A minimum item level. When low-tier guilds are looking for warm bodies to fill their raid roster, what is the first thing that gets looked at? Item level. What's the first thing listed in a Group finder advertisement? &quot;720+ ilvl&quot;. The dungeon finder and rando's in trade chat aren't going to look to make sure that you have the right percentage of crit expected by your class or that you have a certain threshold of mastery before accepting you. <br />
<br />
Serious guilds aren't - they're going to look at your stats, your equipment, your logs and they're going to make sure that, even if you're the player with the highest ilvl on the server, that you know what you're doing, that you know how to play your class, that your DPS numbers reflect your high ilvl. If you have a really weird stat priority, like you're stacking haste which is shit for your spec, they're going to ask you why. <br />
<br />
This changes literally nothing about the game. In my character pane on live, I already minimize those panels that don't mean anything to me currently and shuffle them down to the bottom of the list. The focus on item level is, if anything, the community's fault. We were the one that made Gearscore back in WoTLK days. We were the ones that boiled random pugs down to a number on a website. This is just the expected end result of that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Don't get me wrong; I'm pleased with some of them going away. I never liked hit, and I'm glad they merged things like spell/physical haste and spell/physical crit. I also never cared for Resilience, PvP Power, or Defense Rating.<br />
<br />
What I wish stayed... they should have just merged all resistances into Spell Resistance and kept Spell Pen, Armor Pen, and Bonus Armor. Yes, AP had its problems, but that's because players got way too much. It'd be like letting someone have max crit all the time. Adjusting the algorithm would have been a better move. Also, keep Dodge, Parry, Block, Expertise, and Multistrike instead of Versatility. While Multistrike is comparable to crit, it looked damn cool.<br />

<br />
A quick check of wowhead (sorry, mmo-champion, I know how to use their system better) shows that there are 1708 pieces of gear that have been data-mined from Legion files that are between iLvl 801 and 940. (Mythic raid gear is 900, legendary items are 895, and so on.) There are iLvl 820 items that have a minimum level of 98 (I think dungeon drops) that are above the Order Hall sets.<br />
<br />
Hopefully, this won't cause undue stress to the raiders who don't think that non-raiders should have any fun gear...<br />
<br />
(Looks like: 2-pc, faster healing between battles, open-world questing; 4-pc, damage taken reduced when near death, open-world questing; 6-pc, bonus to primary stat; 8-pc, rotational spell causes procs of secondary stat.)<br />
<br />
I'm in favor of any gear progression that allows a casual to stay within 1-2 tiers of current content. And I ESPECIALLY like that most of these bonuses are for open-world questing (i.e., so they're not as important to raiders?).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Funny how that goes. I am on the alpha, and as I've said, I have yet to see this simplicity which would allow a 4-year old to excell. And those &quot;basic rotations&quot; still don't help anyone to excell beyond his/her personal capability, so I wouldn't worry about that either.<br />
<br />
Oh, by the way, if WoW is &quot;simpler by the expansion&quot;, then I'd REALLY like to invite you to my guild since that means you've beaten every boss and perfected your performance to the point where you outshine Method players at every turn. You know, since they clocked 900 wipes in HFC Mythic and all. Filthy casuals. :rolleyes:. I actually should start inviting everyone that speaks of how simple and easy the game is now, since they're surely all diamonds in the rough just waiting to be snatched up and allowed to show this full potential which comes so easily to them!<br />
<br />
Do you mean 900 wipes over the whole instance or just one boss? Because if you mean the whole instance it is a joke, remember Paragon had over 500 wipes only on Cataclysm Ragnaros? This game is just gettin easier and easier.</div></div><hr />

Remeber this is the excuse (Legion) why WoD's content went bulls*it.<br />
<br />
Exactly, the more they (Blizz) release the more I don't want to buy Legion, let's how it will be on release, I will watch some Streams and decide. It's the first time in years that I don't pre-order an expansion lol because it's just &quot;downgrading&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">guardian_titan</div><div class="date">2016-04-23, 03:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">1.) With artifact knowledge, Blizzard won't make it that easy to increase how much you gain. Want to bet they gate it behind something else like they did the garrison campaign so you can't knock it out in a weekend and go from 1x artifact power to 7x or whatever the cap ends up being inside a day?<br />
<br />
Unless those artifact knowledge quests are also class specific (although the artifacts themselves aren't exactly class specific if you look at quests like the balance druid and unholy DK), those will get boring really fast after your second or so toon. If the only difference is the lore book thing you get after doing the quest, I can see a lot growing bored with it quickly and people whining that alts are too hard to maintain.<br />
<br />
I'm still not convinced that the artifact knowledge thing will make offspecs worthwhile or even alts. Unless I'm somehow inundated with artifact power, chances are it'd be no different from now: I'd be stuck gearing one spec and the other spec is lucky to get crumbs. Then when I do get the opportunity to use my offspec, I end up kicked back to my main spec because my offspec is so crappily geared I'm lucky to hit like a wet noodle. I've played a resto shaman for years and I'm tired of my elemental spec getting the brush off. If I get Legion, for once, my focus will be on elemental and resto will get the crumbs. Unless leveling offspec artifacts is decent and not mindnumbingly boring (which I expect Blizzard will ultimately do just to draw things out), I won't be healing at all. That's even if I'm sticking with my shaman. I've mained her since February 2007 alongside my paladin. This is the first time I've considered changing mains. May finally shift to my mage just to avoid healing entirely.<br />
<br />
2.) Those class sets are hideous. For starters, they're ARMOR sets which brings back the terrible taste in my mouth regarding the crappy LFR sets. For two, I expected them to be iconic looks to the classes, not armor sets that look like (CRAPPY) quest rewards. Here's hoping the models are just placeholders because they look TERRIBLE. Also can't wait to see what the bonuses end up being. They can't compete with normal+ tier because, let's face it, raiders will whine they're forced to get the class sets. If they don't whine about that, they'll whine that casual players get access to really good gear for not doing anything. So want to bet they end up on par with LFR for boring bonuses? I wouldn't be shocked if 2-pc was 200 versatility, 4-pc was 200 strength/intellect/agility, 6-pc was 200 crit/haste/mastery, and 8-pc was something actually useful for your class and maybe your spec although it'd probably be something boring like a 1 second reduction on cooldowns after using your primary spell or something. If that's not the case, then Blizzard will probably gate them behind something like completing the release raid tier on normal or higher and/or hitting a certain honor level and/or getting to a certain mythic+ dungeon level. If the bonuses are actually good, Blizzard won't let most players get it. And then I wouldn't put it past them to either nerf it into the ground when the second tier comes out or replace it with some new set that is still unavailable to most players. But the fact that Blizzard is using armor sets rather than class sets (despite them being called order hall sets), that suggests they'll be more readily available and as a result incredibly boring.<br />
<br />
3.) The new character stat pane I thought was a joke when I first saw it on another site. Really can't believe Blizzard is reducing it that much. Hopefully an addon can bring back the old look. The new one is too simple with too much unused space. Blizzard's better off moving it back to where it was below the character pane if they want it that tiny, but then they have the issue of the equipment manager and titles which is likely why it's still where it is.<br />
<br />
4.) I'm not pleased with the PvP talents. Why is it PvP gets a lot of cool abilities, steals abilities that used to be available for both PvE and PvP (looking at earth shield and grounding totem), or get old abilities returned that were removed years ago and can use them in PvP alongside the standard class talents AND artifact talents but PvE players only get class talents and artifact talents? Why is it the artifact tree is filled with largely boring 1% increases to things while the PvP tree gets various abilities? Why aren't the PvP talents more like damage reduction (in general and while CC'd), CC reduction, giving a class a CC, giving a class a personal HoT or stealth detection, etc? If artifacts are like 75% crappy 1% increase talents, then PvP talents should be similar. They also shouldn't take away abilities that used to be available for BOTH PvE and PvP to just give it to one group.<br />
<br />
And yes, I'm well aware of where the 1% increases came from. I started a week after TBC came out and played all through until MoP where I quit for a year. Playing off nostalgia of the old talent trees doesn't make those 1% choices interesting. They're boring and hardly noticeable in the scheme of things. Oh yay, instead of my spell hitting for 10k, it now hits for 10.1k! So exciting! :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
5.) Would figure the horse2 (unicorns) would be PvP mounts. The skulls were obvious in hindsight. So begs the question how boring the PvE version will be since Blizzard will just give us that as a mount with no armor. We'll be lucky for it to have a decent saddle although I wouldn't put it past Blizzard to slap a blanket on it and call it good. When Blizzard brought in the new WoD talbuks, I expected an armored version to go with the TBC war talbuks. I was disappointed when that didn't happen. The WoD talbuks irritated me enough as it was with the walk animation and the tail, but for Blizzard to just ignore the armored version ... and when they did an armored version for EVERY OTHER MOUNT they added in Draenor, that was a severely missed opportunity. They should have also gone back and added a red TBC talbuk and a white WoD one. They could have also added a fixed white war talbuk (in addition to the bugged one available now) and two WoD white armored ones (one with blue hooves/horns, one with normal ones). Blizzard keeps missing opportunities and it's disappointing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;These changes make item level the most important stat! Wah wah wah!&quot; <br />
<br />
Do you even play the same game as I? Item level has been the most important stat for several expacs now for casuals. When you can't queue for a Heroic dungeon or LFR, what is it that the dungeon finder tells you is too low? Item level. When someone's spamming LFM in Trade/LookingForGroup, what is it they're asking for? A minimum item level. When low-tier guilds are looking for warm bodies to fill their raid roster, what is the first thing that gets looked at? Item level. What's the first thing listed in a Group finder advertisement? &quot;720+ ilvl&quot;. The dungeon finder and rando's in trade chat aren't going to look to make sure that you have the right percentage of crit expected by your class or that you have a certain threshold of mastery before accepting you. <br />
<br />
Serious guilds aren't - they're going to look at your stats, your equipment, your logs and they're going to make sure that, even if you're the player with the highest ilvl on the server, that you know what you're doing, that you know how to play your class, that your DPS numbers reflect your high ilvl. If you have a really weird stat priority, like you're stacking haste which is shit for your spec, they're going to ask you why. <br />
<br />
This changes literally nothing about the game. In my character pane on live, I already minimize those panels that don't mean anything to me currently and shuffle them down to the bottom of the list. The focus on item level is, if anything, the community's fault. We were the one that made Gearscore back in WoTLK days. We were the ones that boiled random pugs down to a number on a website. This is just the expected end result of that.<br />
<br />
Exactly but what I'm saying is, that's not good nor something we should want. This just helps embrace ilvl even more, when it's not an indicator of skill in the slightest.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There are two DH sets. Is this an error or is the DH the new Rogue ... damn Blizzard 4 leather wearing classes and only 2 mail ... happy loot drama.<br />
<br />
Class order hall of the Rogue is a slap in the face of the majority aof the class - it is disapointing - just here an there some new thing - but the same feeling as walking in the current dalaran sewers. The order class halls of the Hunter and Warrior looks pretty different - i'll check later the class order halls of the other classes as well. But in the end all order class halls will walk down the same road - they will get a burden and will get dull fast - like the garrison. I can't understand Blizzard why they invest such amount of time in an feature which will get very fast dull.</div></div><hr />
