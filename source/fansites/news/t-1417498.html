Patch 5.4.2 Live This Week<br />
Patch 5.4.2 is going live this week, with most of the changes being small fixes or assets for future use. The two bigger changes are the addition of cross-realm listing to the Raid Browser (http://wowpedia.org/Raid_Browser) and cross-realm mailing of Account Bound items (http://www.wowdb.com/items?filter-bind=10). The Karazhan changes (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3571-Patch-5-4-2-Karazhan-Cleanup-Blue-Tweets-Setup-of-the-Month-Blizzcon-Cosplay) are still reverted as of the latest build.<br />
<br />
In-Game Store<br />
The In-Game Store will allow you to purchase items from the Battle.Net Shop (https://us.battle.net/shop/en/). It isn't clear if this will be active when the patch goes live, as the last PTR build removed all of the pets and mounts from the store again. <br />

Upcoming Changes to Flex Mechanic Scaling<br />
At BlizzCon, we'd discussed some improvements to our Flexible scaling system that would minimize the existence and impact of any real or perceived &quot;breakpoints.&quot; Our design goal has always been for the system to be neutral with respect to group size. Specifically, you should never feel encouraged to turn away interested players whose skill/gear level matches the rest of the group's, basic role composition constraints notwithstanding. But at the same time, you shouldn't feel like you need to go out and grab warm bodies if you have a perfectly serviceable raid already assembled. Clearly we have not yet fully realized those goals.<br />
<br />
In general, the existing healing/damage scaling slightly favors larger groups, since boss health and damage scale up more slowly than does raid throughput. To use a specific example, an 18-player raid with 12 damage-dealers will kill a boss slightly faster than a 10-player raid with 6 damage-dealers (assuming equal skill/gear between the two groups). But it is true that currently some specific abilities exhibit breakpoints, where adding an extra player causes an extra add to spawn, or an ability to strike an additional target.<br />
<br />
To help smooth out difficulty scaling as you add or remove players from your Flexible raid, we will be implementing one of our planned Warlords changes to the scaling system ahead of schedule. In the near future, several boss abilities that target more players as the size of a Flex raid increases will use weighted randomization rather than strict breakpoints. <br />
<br />
An example to illustrate what I mean:<br />
<br />
Today, Sun Tenderheart's Shadow Word: Bane ability afflicts 2 targets if your raid size is between 10 and 14, but begins to hit a third target at 15. <br />
<br />
Once our upcoming change is in place, if you have a 13-player raid, there will be a 60% chance for each cast of the ability to hit 3 targets, and a 40% chance for it to hit 2. If you add an extra player, and thus have 14, there will now be an 80% chance for 3 debuffs to go out, and a 20% chance for only 2. <br />
<br />
In short, with respect to this particular ability, adding an extra player will always give you an average of 0.2 extra Bane debuffs. No more breakpoints!<br />
<br />
There will be a handful of exceptions where breakpoints remain necessary. Imprison on Sha of Pride is probably the most notable such example, where you really want to pre-plan who will cover which prisons, and having a random number of targets each cast would cause frustrating unpredictability.<br />
<br />
There's nothing wrong with 14-player groups -- 14 players is a great size for a raid. But so is 15. And 19. And 12. And 22. We just want to help make sure that good players aren't being turned away from groups because of the notion that their presence will make things harder for everyone.<br />
<br />
A pity, Sha prisons are one of the biggest reasons people go for 14. I want to know how Malkorok void zone spawning area expands as people add, currently that seems to be 10-15 you get half the room, 16-25 the whole room.<br />
That's interesting, since currently the &quot;magic number&quot; for getting a third Imprison target is 18 players.<br />
<br />
The way Malkorok Implosions should work is that with 14+ players (yes, 14) you get a fourth spawning, and then an additional one for each 3 players past that. If you're seeing a huge jump in the number of Implosions spawning based on a small change in raid size, that sounds like a bug, and I'd love to hear more so that we can investigate the issue. <br />
<br />

Considering that heirlooms have always been able to be shipped cross-faction within the same server, I don't see why that would change now that they can be shipped cross-server.</div></div><hr />

I want to know how Malkorok void zone spawning area expands as people add, currently that seems to be 10-15 you get half the room, 16-25 the whole room.<br />
<br />
<br />
That's interesting, since currently the &quot;magic number&quot; for getting a third Imprison target is 18 players.<br />
<br />
The way Malkorok Implosions should work is that with 14+ players (yes, 14) you get a fourth spawning, and then an additional one for each 3 players past that. If you're seeing a huge jump in the number of Implosions spawning based on a small change in raid size, that sounds like a bug, and I'd love to hear more so that we can investigate the issue.*<br />
<br />
<br />
Looks like someone misunderstood the question. May it be that Blizz didn't notice yet that the void zones(especially those far away from the inner circle) are actually not spawning all over the room but just in the half of it that is closeto the entry? I was always wondering if that's intentionally...</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've seen the void zones on both sides of the room though so this isn't necessarily accurate. Just last week it started out mostly on entry side then after transition moved to the other side. Nearly wiped the pug group I was in with no voice. Luckily some people were paying attn. and rolled, blinked, their way there in time.</div></div><hr />

It is only Asia, people love to freak out about anything on the PTR. All the store stuff is more than likely Asia. But I do believe the Battle.Net Shop that will be connected to are Battle.net Client is for US/EU though. As the Blizzard Store redirects to that.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sargiean</div><div class="date">2013-12-10, 11:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Arbs, I think his point is that they charge us 14.99 a month to play a game. They then use the 14.99 that they charge us to pay designers and artists to create things like store pets and mounts, which they charge us for - again. It's double dipping, and WoW is one of the only games that gets away with it without any sort of strong backlash from the community. For example, ME 3 had day 1 DLC (a party member) and people were livid over it. <br />
<br />
If a game is F2P, then selling cosmetics like this is how they pay themselves and their staff. When you're already charging people, it seems greedy. It's the reason why I've voted with my consumer dollars by NOT purchasing anything from the store.</div></div><hr />

<br />
this double dipping needs to stop. are we a sub based game? or a f2p game? blizzard wants to have its cake, and eat it too. the fact that our sub fee went towards content we cant even earn in-game, is ridiculous.<br />
<br />
and people wonder why subs have declined. no, we dont need content, we need more useless shit like vanity mounts.</div></div><hr />

<br />
this double dipping needs to stop. are we a sub based game? or a f2p game? blizzard wants to have its cake, and eat it too. the fact that our sub fee went towards content we cant even earn in-game, is ridiculous.<br />
<br />
and people wonder why subs have declined. no, we dont need content, we need more useless shit like vanity mounts.<br />
<br />
The store and now in-game store have nothing to do with sub. <br />
<br />
The revenue from the store and now in-game store if anything subsidise the subscription or at least provides a buffer that has helped keep the subscription fee stationary. <br />
<br />
The 'lack of content' has nothing to do with the store and now in-game store.</div></div><hr />

Your Argument is invalid. And I will even bother telling you why:<br />
<br />
1. They made the website store from subscription fees in the first place.<br />
<br />
2. The subscription fee should be much lower now, due to economies of scale (costs) and technical progression (for example: you dont need as many GM's now due to new technical features). The only thing that kept the fee &quot;stable&quot; is Blizzard's greed alone.</div></div><hr />

The ingame store has everything to do with subs. It devalues the subs since subscribers are NOT able to get any of the now... ingame shop content without paying extra - and are in most cases UNABLE to get them through normal means ingame.<br />
<br />
There are not many games that sink this low. Most F2P games that offer subscription as well put portion of the monthly sub into virtual currency to GUARANTY that the subscriber is actually able to enjoy ALL the content in the game with their subscription. <br />
<br />
Here is a fact. Subscribers of WOW are unable to get bigger and bigger portion of the game wihout paying extra ON TOP of the subscription.<br />

Didn't you quit along time ago or say you weren't coming back - http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/1294028-Why-will-you-not-come-back-to-MOP ??, But anyway the only thing on their are the same virtual items from the Blizzard Store anyway, The same old pets &amp; mounts.<br />
<br />
If you actually did read my MOP post you would have noticed &quot;And thats why Im not going back to MOP&quot;. MOP is just one expansion. Next one is WOD and this ingame item shop feature will make it 100% certain that I will not be touching that expansion or WOW again. <br />
<br />
Why am I not coming back to WOD ? Because as a subscriber... I expect ALL of the content to be available IF it is put into ingame shop. If 5$ of my 15$ that went into subscription would go directly into my WOW balance account and I would be able to buy items in the store... then this move would not directly devalue the sub.. But it doesn't - and it means that the final barrier has fallen in keeping this game as a true subscription game.<br />
<br />
WOW is not a true subscription game anymore.. since your subscription fee does no longer give you access to all the content that is available in the game. You have have to pay extra.<br />
<br />
Regarding this being the same that was in webstore. There is a big difference in a web store and ingame store. If you don't know the difference then I can't help you. Games with ingame stores do not prevent their players from playing their game by making it a mandatory sub as well. <br />
<br />
And here is a quote ftw <br />
<br />
Arbs, I think his point is that they charge us 14.99 a month to play a game. They then use the 14.99 that they charge us to pay designers and artists to create things like store pets and mounts, which they charge us for - again. It's double dipping, and WoW is one of the only games that gets away with it without any sort of strong backlash from the community. For example, ME 3 had day 1 DLC (a party member) and people were livid over it. <br />
<br />
If a game is F2P, then selling cosmetics like this is how they pay themselves and their staff. When you're already charging people, it seems greedy. It's the reason why I've voted with my consumer dollars by NOT purchasing anything from the store.</div></div><hr />
