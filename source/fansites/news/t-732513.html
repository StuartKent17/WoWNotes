Cataclysm Models Update<br />
I missed a few models in my original post, below you will find:<br />
<br />
Undead Nefarian<br />
Lady Sinestra (WoWWiki (http://www.wowwiki.com/Sintharia)<br />
A cute spider<br />
<br />
<br />
Lady Sinestra's model is only a half body, just like Kil'jaeden's in the Sunwell. It could explain the hole in the floor (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2010/cataclysm/cataclysm_zones/12266/sandbox/grimbatolraid_10.jpg) in the last room of the Bastion of Twilight. (The one leading to the secret room (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2010/cataclysm/cataclysm_zones/12266/sandbox/grimbatolraid_11.jpg))<br />

Zones Update<br />
A couple of Zones pages have been updated today. <br />
<br />
Tol Barad (Article (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/1659-Tol-Barad))<br />
A loading screen and 16 screenshots from the latest build has been added. The zone is still in developement but it's starting to look better and it's interesting to see how a zone evolves through the development process.<br />

Twilight Highlands (Article (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/1657-Twilight-Highlands))<br />
The mass of tentacles has been updated into ... a tentacle thing (I really need to find a proper name for this one), you can see it in action in the video below. I also added a cavern I didn't spot earlier, it seems to lead to Deepholm.<br />

Ironforge (Article (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/1074-Ironforge))<br />
Ironforge didn't change that much (for the moment?) but I figured you would be happy to see how the Ironforge Airfield looks now! I also included a picture of the new throne room. <br />

Blue Posts<br />
Beta Testing<br />
No Addons in Beta<br />
The current plan is to allow for them eventually, but that's contingent upon many factors. We're still doing a lot of work on the default user interface and want to make sure that can be tested with as few variables as possible. Trying to allow for third-party addons when it's quite likely some fairly major changes will be coming with each patch just makes testing and reviewing bug reports that much more difficult.<br />
<br />
Once we feel there's much more polish on the core features of the UI, we'll consider allowing addons to be used again. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25626576491/no-addons-for-the-duration-of-the-beta/))<br />
<br />
Dev Notes in Talent Trees<br />
Yeah, we probably should have removed those notes. What was happening is that developers would want to do a dungeon or BG test or something and occasionally picked classes that at the moments had their guts ripped out. For example, there might not be enough talents in the tree to get down to the bottom talent. We tried annotating the talent trees so people would have an idea of what they were getting into. A &quot;60% complete&quot; talent tree would suggest that they might still see a lot of broken stuff. I wouldn't give those numbers a second thought as an alpha / beta participant.<br />
<br />
Warlock talent trees still have a long way to go. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/24702232806/warlock/))<br />

Cataclysm Beta Scam Mails<br />
There are indeed phishing emails in circulation right now that mimic World of Warcraft: Cataclysm closed beta invites, and players should always remain cautious when responding to or clicking on links contained within emails that appear to be sent from Blizzard Entertainment.<br />
<br />
That said, players who are selected to participate in the beta will receive a notification email. While the email itself isn't necessary for beta access, it does contain more detailed instructions for installation, common troubleshooting steps and helpful reminders, and customer support contact information&#8212;useful bits of data to have. So, be sure to double-check that you're not reading real email from Blizzard Entertainment before clicking that &quot;delete&quot; button. (If you're unsure how to tell a legitimate email from a phishing email, here's a good guide to reference: http://us.blizzard.com/support/article/25133).<br />
<br />
You are definitely correct, though, Elbeghast. Players who are invited to the World of Warcraft: Cataclysm closed beta will be able to tell by visiting their Battle.net Account Management page and checking the available licenses under the &quot;Manage My Games&quot; section. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25712372497/all-beta-emails/))<br />
<br />
Closed Beta and Random Invitations<br />
The fact is we can't invite every paying customer into the beta test process. It wouldn't make for a good environment to collect feedback or get focused testing, not to mention the number of test realms we'd need to run.<br />
<br />
Yes, some people are granted access to the beta through promotional opportunities, because they're a part of our fansite program, etc. These invites still make up an incredibly small percentage of the total number of people invited this week. Also, it's been a couple of days since beta started. We will be inviting thousands of people just about every week -- provided we have the room for more testers -- to join the Cataclysm beta.<br />
<br />
It simply isn't reasonable to expect that, because one individual pays to play the game, they should be given immediate access to test the upcoming expansion. That is not the purpose of a beta test. Aside from the few promotional opportunities we have had where people could score beta keys, we do not invite the player base at-large as though it's included with everyone's subscription fees. We make it fair and randomly invite as many people as possible as often as possible.<br />
<br />
To clarify, Bobby Kotick is not a developer or producer for World of Warcraft: Cataclysm, or any other Blizzard game. He is the CEO of Activision Blizzard, our video games publisher. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25626347091/great-timing-on-beta/))<br />
<br />
Classes<br />
Threat Decay<br />
If you tanked pre-LK, maintaining threat as a tank was a pretty big deal. The best tanks were the ones who could generate threat quickly and keep it high, allowing the raid to go to 100% quickly. We lost that a little in LK, and part of the reason was Tricks and Misdirect. Those abilities can keep a tank's threat high enough to where the risk of pulling off of the tank is very low.<br />
<br />
But is that fun for the tank? If threat never matters, then the tank is left with trying to stay alive (which comes down to managing cooldowns) and perhaps moving the boss or other encounter-specific mechanics (which to be fair, we do a lot more of these days). The problem with staying alive as a goal is that it's pretty binary. The tank can't really work to &quot;stay alive better than last time&quot; in the same way dps can try to maximize their dps or healers can try to keep everyone up without running OOM. Threat gives tanks something to work on. It gives you a reason to hit that Shield Slam at the right moment rather than being lazy and mostly autoattacking.<br />
<br />
Having said all that, we don't want threat to constantly feel like a throttle and we don't want tanking to feel horribly frustrating. We want you to be able to manage your own threat as a tank and we'll give you the tools to do that, but then you actually need to do that. Having a slow threat decay makes sure that your job is never done -- that you can't get so far ahead of everyone that hitting Shield Slam at the right time becomes irrelevant for the rest of the fight. If you are already an awesome tank you probably won't notice a difference.<br />
<br />
[...] You won't suddenly notice a massive drop because &quot;decay kicked in.&quot; But you'll never be able to get so far ahead of everyone else that there is no possibility of them catching up even if you do nothing. As I said, if you hit all your buttons now, you won't notice a difference, but there might be a more noticeable difference between good tanks and bad tanks. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/24702403015/the-tank-thread/))<br />
<br />
Vengeance<br />
Vengeance isn't to make threat irrelevant. Vengeance is to solve a very specific problem, which is that if threat is balanced in the first tier, it won't be balanced in the last tier because dps specs gain a lot more dps stats from their dps gear than tanks gain dps stats from their tank gear. As an alternative, we considered just not making tanking gear, but we didn't like how that would feel. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/24702403015/the-tank-thread/))<br />

Hunter Pets in Cataclysm<br />
We're in the middle of converting the stables over to the new model.<br />
<br />
New model:<br />
<br />
You have 5 active pets and 20 (or more) stable slots. You can summon an active pet whenever you want, out of combat. This replaces the remote stable spell. In other words, if you have a crab, a bear and a wolf, you can swap from wolf to bear in between encounters.<br />
<br />
You must visit a stable master to change which are the active pets though. There are a lot of stable slots, so you can catch Spirit Beasts or rare spawns or whatever you want, even if you don't think you will use them often.

Cataclysm Video Update<br />
I didn't have time to upload big videos yet but here are 2 small videos that you will most likely enjoy. <br />
<br />
The first one is a video of ... the Maelstrom! Yup. It definitely doesn't look like a playable zone but I wouldn't be surprised to see it in a cutscene at some point.<br />
<br />
&lt;center&gt;&lt;object width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;405&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;movie&quot; value=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/v/2yWCAnOQWQM&amp;amp;hl=en_US&amp;amp;fs=1&quot;&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;allowFullScreen&quot; value=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;allowscriptaccess&quot; value=&quot;always&quot;&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;embed src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/v/2yWCAnOQWQM&amp;amp;hl=en_US&amp;amp;fs=1&quot; type=&quot;application/x-shockwave-flash&quot; allowscriptaccess=&quot;always&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;405&quot;&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/center&gt;<br />

The 2nd video is an aerial view of ... that tentacle thing, in the Twilight Highlands. <br />

<br />
Seeing that the Maelstrom will be ingame (in whatever way, pretty sure we might even be able to fly over it but not into or near it because of some &quot;force holding us back, the power of the maelstrom etc.&quot;) so I hope that Nazjatar will also be, as in we'll fight Azshara, possibly as a pre-boss to the Old God she serves who'd be the final boss of whatever dungeon.<br />
<br />
There's so much off the Maelstrom, Naga, Old God etc. related stuff in this expansion, it just wouldn't feel right to leave one/two of the biggest baddies in this regard untouched.</div></div><hr />

She died in the book &quot;Night of the Dragon&quot; and that was canon. As far as lore was concerned, she was dead.<br />

<br />
The Deepholme Temple (i48.tinypic.com/qnpimh.jpg) has a nice volcano theme going, and the graphic on top of it is the same as the one that's rising up from the Maelstrom (i48.tinypic.com/2cncdgx.jpg). Furthermore, the roof of Deepholme is open and a Twisting Nether-ish sky is visible, in the middle of which is a circular swirling thing (i50.tinypic.com/16ktj13.jpg) that has the same rotation as the Maelstrom seen from below.

Blizzard said that Deathwing break thru the Maelstorm from deepholme (instead of Deathwing's scar, like they said on Blizzcon). The Maelstorm must be the gateway to deepholme, we will most likely only be able to see it when we travel there, like in some sort cinematic flight path or something like that.<br />
<br />
<br />
Those tentacles are all over azeroth, this new old god influence must be huge. This must be how an Old God is when he is fully unleashed</div></div><hr />

<br />
The Deepholme Temple (i48.tinypic.com/qnpimh.jpg) has a nice volcano theme going, and the graphic on top of it is the same as the one that's rising up from the Maelstrom (i48.tinypic.com/2cncdgx.jpg). Furthermore, the roof of Deepholme is open and a Twisting Nether-ish sky is visible, in the middle of which is a circular swirling thing (i50.tinypic.com/16ktj13.jpg) that has the same rotation as the Maelstrom seen from below. Coincidence?<br />
<br />
It has already been said that dethwing enters azeroth from deepholme through the maelstrom. People were QQing somewhere (cant remember where) about the massive gash seperating the badlands from loch modan, and that that was the place where deathwing emerged but apparantly he comes out of the maelstrom :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you look at Onyxia's &quot;resurrected&quot; model you can see stiches around her neck, so it was sowed back on. Looking at the screenshot of Nefarian's model you can't really see his neck so he may very well have stitches too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You might actually. Blizzard wants to test the beta on a wide variety of computers. They won't only take people with the best PC's or something, if they did they would just have information about how well the game runs on a few kind of PC's. They want to be able to test the game on about as a bad as a computer they can find to as best of a computer they can find, and as much different kinds of computers in between those two.<br />
<br />
Having a non-average computer would theoretically increase the chance of being allowed into the beta (early), since there are less people with a computer like you.<br />
<br />
See it like this: If you have 100 players, 25 may have a state-of-the-art PC, another 25 may have a really old PC and the other 50 have average PC's. Imagine that Blizzard wanted to have 5 players out of each type of PC to test the beta. This would mean that each person with an average PC would have to &quot;compete&quot; with 49 other people, while those with high-end or low-end PC's would have just 24 people to compete with. That's a 2% chance (average PC's) against a 4,1% chance to get in the beta.</div></div><hr />

I have a 5-6 year old PC with AGP graphics &amp; an old socket 478 processor and I got in :)<br />
<br />
It's just luck of the draw. That and I think they are trying to invite people with extremely varied setups as to make sure the game is compatible as possible for all.<br />
<br />
Don't panic as Blizzard will still be sending out random invites over the coming weeks. You never know, you may get one!</div></div><hr />

Sinestra was brought back probably by fusing her dead body with power of the Old God (explains the yellow all over her, and the reason she is only &quot;half&quot; and looks like some kind of japanese dragon), and then she and deathwing brought back their rotten childern, Onyxia and Nefarian. Now those three are guarding hundreds of twilight dragon eggs, which are also probably infused with the power of Old God. <br />

Also, the sphinx statues are probably statues of Tol'vir, &quot;stone cat people&quot; mentioned on blizzcon. Guess we can except lore of Obsidian Destroyes from AQ and Warcraft III, cuz they will probably be related with Tol'vir.<br />

In Cataclysm, Moira's father, King Magni, will turn into stone. Along with her uncle Muradin and Thane Falstad Wildhammer, she will take Magni's place in the High Seat in Ironforge, representing the Dark Iron Dwarves. King Varian Wrynn sends agents of SI:7 to assassinate Moira, sensing that the events in Ironforge would send a shockwave through the Alliance, and they are apparently successful<br />
<br />
<br />
So it looks like she does not live to long from what they say here.</div></div><hr />

It was completely unnecessary and you assumed that merely writing ****SPOILERS****** or anything along those lines, that people would be able to skip it - and I would have, had I not read the damn thing so fast I didn't register it in time and thus automatically read onwards before I realised what I was doing. <br />
<br />
Even then, I would feel like a complete prat if I have to close my eyes and scroll down, or avert my gaze, and go to all that trouble to avoid reading the spoiler you so intelligently decided to WRITE IN CAPITAL LETTERS in order to make it HARDER TO AVOID. <br />
<br />
Why bother put people at an inconvenience like this when they could just watch the bloody video and find out?<br />
<br />
Oh look, let's warn someone about a spoiler, then write the spoiler itself in capital letters to make it easier to read!

No it just means they've been resurrected, not set back. They probably aren't themselves either, seeing as how they're half-rotted and such.<br />

It was completely unnecessary and you assumed that merely writing ****SPOILERS****** or anything along those lines, that people would be able to skip it - and I would have, had I not read the damn thing so fast I didn't register it in time and thus automatically read onwards before I realised what I was doing. <br />
<br />
Even then, I would feel like a complete prat if I have to close my eyes and scroll down, or avert my gaze, and go to all that trouble to avoid reading the spoiler you so intelligently decided to WRITE IN CAPITAL LETTERS in order to make it HARDER TO AVOID. <br />
<br />
Why bother put people at an inconvenience like this when they could just watch the bloody video and find out?<br />
<br />
Oh look, let's warn someone about a spoiler, then write the spoiler itself in capital letters to make it easier to read! Gah, I cannot understand what goes through some people's heads for them to be so careless. Honestly Garots, as a RP'er I expected you to be a bit more careful with your choice of words than most people are.<br />
<br />
If u don't want to risk seeing a spoiler, then don't come to a SPOILER WEBSITE and bitch like a moron!</div></div><hr />

her death takes place after she appeared in the bc.<br />

she apparently survived Dargonax explosion and has become glowing like the sun.<br />

Anyway, it will be the entrance to Deepholm. Deathwing breaks through Deepholm and enters Azeroth through the Maelstrom.<br />
<br />
And you know what came of that? The Cataclysm. Wonder what'll happen if we try to repeat his stunt, but backwards!<br />
<br />
I'm a bit disappointed by Sinestra's model, sure, it looks cool and all, but half of her body was supposedly badly burnt from having mated with Deathwing, him having lava flowing from his body and shiz. And after that, poof, unstable Twilight dragon explosion. And now it appears the only visible injuries are a few claw marks on her body. Strange.</div></div><hr />

Actually, she tried to take the Demon Soul in &quot;Night of the Dragon&quot; and *exploded. I'm surprised we can see even the top half of her body, let alone her being the only dead Black relative of Deathwing that isn't stitched together.<br />
<br />
*More specifically, and tl:dr for a book that wasn't all that great, After her her Twilight creation, which turned on her, died, she fell to the same power hungry gravity that the demon soul had cast on Deathwing and tried to keep it to herself in her final moments. You saw/see what it did to Deathwing's body, and he's kept together with constantly refitted (goblin) plate so HE doesn't go nova/break apart. Sinestra is far weaker than Deathwing in that invisible scale of power, so blah. She died fast.</div></div><hr />

You know, this makes me think. How the hell could Onyxia and Nefarian be ressurected when both the Horde and Alliance took their heads and put them in Orgrimmar / Stormwind?<br />
<br />
Very easily. If you remember, after killing Onyxia, you took her head to either Neeru Fireblade, who is the true leader of the Burning Blade within Ragefire Chasm, or you took it to the warlock trainer in Stormwind, who is in hiding from the rest of Stormwind...for being a warlock I guess. Either way, they get the head, Twilight Hammer then gets it, voila! Undead dragons.</div></div><hr />

Well she is the daughter of Magni and she was pregnant with the child of Emperor Dagran Thaurissan.Meaning her child is the direct heir to the throne of Ironforge and the Dark Iron Clan.That could have some to do with why she is there.<br />

<br />
Exactly, there are videos up which were shot during the alpha in which you can see the arrow and the text &quot;Thrall&quot; pointing towards the maelstrom. Also, people are forgetting how much larger something can seem if everything else is out of scale. For example, they might put Thrall as an NPC at the Maelstrom, but if they set his size do just 5% of the 'regular' size, the Maelstrom would look HUGE. (Given that the camera work is done the right way too, but I trust Blizzard with that)</div></div><hr />

<br />
The Deepholme Temple (i48.tinypic.com/qnpimh.jpg) has a nice volcano theme going, and the graphic on top of it is the same as the one that's rising up from the Maelstrom (i48.tinypic.com/2cncdgx.jpg). Furthermore, the roof of Deepholme is open and a Twisting Nether-ish sky is visible, in the middle of which is a circular swirling thing (i50.tinypic.com/16ktj13.jpg) that has the same rotation as the Maelstrom seen from below. Coincidence?<br />
<br />
Most likely. Deepholme is not the Maelstrom, within the Maelstrom is the Eye, housing the cities of Nazjatar, Mak'aru and more. Home to the Naga, Makrura and the Murlocs. Even if that WAS how you got to Deepholme. I'd expect a pretty good explanation where everything else beneath it went.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitei</div><div class="date">2010-07-04, 06:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Most likely.

Even if that WAS how you got to Deepholme. I'd expect a pretty good explanation where everything else beneath it went.<br />
<br />
<br />
Actually, it should be pointed out that Nazjatar, Mak'aru and the other features near them are all surrounding the chasm known as &quot;The Rift&quot; that is the base of the maelstrom. It's not too hard to imagine that the entrance to Deepholme is through The Rift, this also makes quite a bit more sense than the original entrance point of Neltharion, since the maelstrom contains latent violent swirling arcane energy, which would weaken and blur the boundary between the physical plane and the Elemental one.<br />
<br />
Edit: (From WowWiki)<br />
&quot;The Rift is all that remains of the first Well of Eternity. It is located in the center of the Eye which itself is located in the center of the Maelstrom. At the end of the War of the Ancients, the powers released in the Well of Eternity blasted the well downward into Azeroth's molten core. 10,000 years later that core is still exposed. The well's descent broke an enormous fissure in the ocean floor. The red and orange light from lava is visible deep, deep down. It is held sacred by the naga who are capable of reaching its depths as the pressure does not seem to affect them. The seafloor around the Rift is noted for its thermal activity. Nazjatar is constructed on the sides of the Rift. Although Brann Bronzebeard could not go too far down into the Rift because of the pressure, he said that &quot;Perhaps the Well of Eternity still exists, in some form, in Azeroth’s heart, for arcane currents emanate from the Rift.&quot;</div></div><hr />

Though from the way it sounds she does have a little surprise coming as in my post on page 4 of this thread.Which would explain why the Dark Irons are attacking.<br />
<br />
Not to be mean, but what you posted on page four doesn't make sense time-wise.<br />
<br />
<br />
Spoilers ahead.....<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The attack is taking place in Dun Morogh, which is a level 1-12 area. So if what you say is true, then Moria will need to die before level 12. And based on the screen shots, we know that the airport serves as a taxi point to reach the quarry, and that the Dark Irons are already attacking it. So that means Moria would need to die before players head to that area. So that only leaves the intro-areas (Gnomer and Coldridge) and Kharanos to set up the storyline. And considering that Moria is in Ironforge, we can count out the starter areas, which then leaves what, 3 levels to tell everything. That is a waste of a story and a character if all there is, is &quot;hey it's Moria&quot; &quot;oh she's dead&quot; &quot;well, gotta go fight Dark Irons&quot;.<br />
<br />
And really that's all there would be time for. Not counting, the fact that in order to do that, Kharanos will basically have to be skipped over, and not used at all (Since for any real time to be spent on Moria and how/why dies was killed, you gotta be in Ironforge). <br />
<br />
<br />
It would be more sense, if the Dark Irons attack shortly after you finish up in Kharanos, and after fighting then back, you discover that Moria was behind it, and is trying to usurp control over Ironforge. Then I would have it where, either you then head over to Sotrmwind, show Varian the proof, and then return to a phased Ironforge with re-inforcements to free the city and kill Moria.<br />
<br />
Or, even better, I would have it so you return with the evidence, Moria is arrested, but manages to escape back to Blackrock. Varian, sends out his SI:7 agents after her, while the Dwarves mob up the remaining dark Irons and start rebuilding. And then, once you hit the level 50 range and return to Searing Gorge/Burning steppes you finally end it all. <br />
<br />
Also, for Moria to die in Dun Morgoh, that will mean they would have to make changes to BRD, ala Deadmines, or leave it as is and it'll be a weird time blimp in your character's progression. But if Moria survives until you enter BRD, it'll be much simpler to make her the final boss, and change a few quests.</div></div><hr />

Also, I think that tentacle thing is a reference to the sarlacc, someone should jump into it and see if they spend a thousand years digesting slowly<br />
<br />
I think we should name it the wowlacc until we have a real name to go by<br />

Or she opens up a wellfair office for single dwarf mothers, and Ironforge becomes a trailer park filled with low income families. Not sure about you, but I find this more likely as blizzard is &quot;trying to keep it real yo&quot; with a large chunk of thier game population ^.^ :D &gt;.&gt;</div></div><hr />

It's not the same model. Boub said that she's only half a body like Kil'Jaeden, not that it's his actual model with a new skin.<br />
<br />
And no, it's not lazy. It's just how they want the boss to look and how the fight to work. No one complained about Kologarn.</div></div><hr />

Well look at the shape of the wings and everything. Imo it's obvious they've used the same basic model, even if details are different. <br />
<br />
Kologarn used the same mechanic, but not in the same context, and not the same model. By looking at Sinestra model one could almost guess she will appear in some Sunwellish portal from the ground.</div></div><hr />

In Nefarian's case, how is that any different than normal? He was already 3 gems shy of a socket bonus to begin with. Maybe death and being brought back has stabilized his psycho self, and that would make him REALLY dangerous</div></div><hr />

yes i know they are related, but still doesn't change the freaking fact that they look nothing alike at all. Absolutely nothing alike at all.<br />

Familial resemblance is often very difficult to spot even in people you know are related. As for people you don't know, especially people quite different from yourself it can be very hard if there isn't an obvious signifier - say a very similar nose the family all have.<br />
<br />
Now think how difficult it is to spot family resemblance in another animal, say a cat. Hard isn't it?<br />
<br />
Now think how difficult it would be for a human to spot family resemblance in a dragon. Would we know where to look? <br />
<br />
<br />
I think you're expecting a bit much from Blizzard. And it's not like there isn't one reasonably noticeable trait Sintharia passed to her kids - they all have webbed crests around/on their heads. Ol' Deathwing lacks this and so do most black dragons, but Sintharia and her kids have it.</div></div><hr />

Looks like it's Muradin Bronzebeard &lt;Bronzebeard Representative&gt; who'll be in charge of Iron Forge if something happens to Magni. It'll probably defer to him due to the issues involving Moira until a final decision is made.</div></div><hr />

Moira is pregnant, her child will rightfully be king/queen of both ironforge and the dark iron dwarfs.</div></div><hr />

I mean there were 5 OGs. 4 are already dead so there is 1 left. When Deathwing awakes there is a voice in his head that tells him that it´s time for his outburst (cata storypage). We all know that he kind of &quot;works&quot; for the Old Gods. The OGs were banished into the elemental plane and with Deathwings outburst from deepholme the elemental plane becomes accesible from Azeroth. So this Old God could have fled and is now fully unleashed on Azeroth. Also the close resemblance to Yogg and C´thun speaks for that theory<br />
<br />
At least this sounds consistet but we´ll see.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Most, not all.<br />
<br />
And not kids, most of the Black Dragonflight are descended from her.<br />
<br />
In other words although we can assume most of the black dragons we encounter are at least related to her we cannot assume all the black dragons/drakes etc we have met are her children.<br />
<br />
The ones which are confirmed as her having been birthed by her share this trait.<br />
<br />
I could have said all of this in my post but I thought everyone who read it would gather that I was aware of who she was without needing an explicit statement I did and an explanation for my referring only to Ony and Nef as her kids. Others may be but we don't know and as she was not his only consort we cannot be certain without some indication.</div></div><hr />

(Sorry if it's brought up before) Yes, I know we defeated him, but it's only the eye and his body (if you could call that tiny thing a body of an old god even).<br />
<br />
Also wowwiki claims: &quot;While the Alliance and Horde were focused on defeating the Lich King, Cho'gall began the resurrection of his new master, the Old God C'Thun, monstrously deforming the ogre's body in the process.<br />
Med'an and the New Council of Tirisfal defeated Cho'gall using Atiesh, Greatstaff of the Guardian, burying him beneath the rubble of Ahn'Qiraj.&quot;<br />
<br />
doesn't this still imply that C'thun CAN be ressurected. And as Cho'gall still lives (and is a new boss in Cata even)... possible or unlikely?</div></div><hr />

Something has already happened to Magni, he got stoned. Thats why they are here and have an excuse for making peace between the three hammers.<br />
