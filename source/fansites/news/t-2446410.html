World of Warcraft: What's Next Panel Recap<br />
The war between the Horde and Alliance continues in Azeroth, but there are additional dark forces at work. To provide you with more insights for what lies ahead, Game Director Ion Hazzikostas was joined by designers Jeremy Feasel, and Ryan Shwayder.<br />
<br />
The Road Ahead<br />
The release of each expansion is its own chapter in the ongoing story of Azeroth. With Battle for Azeroth, we’re just at the beginning of our journey and much like the content release schedule for Legion, Battle for Azeroth will provide a series of both large and small content updates to take you on that journey while providing a steady stream of content and focusing on systems and rewards.<br />
<br />
Here’s a quick recap of what’s in store for the next content update currently on the Public Test Realm.<br />
<br />
Tides of Vengeance Content Update<br />
<br />
New Warfront: Battle for Darkshore: In the ashen shadow of Teldrassil, the night elves strike back against the Forsaken to reclaim their ancestral homeland in an all-new co-op Warfront. In between battles, discover what awaits in a new version of the Darkshore zone reshaped by the fires of war.<br />
Horde and Alliance Assaults: As war spreads across Azeroth, defend Kul Tiras and Zandalar from the enemy faction’s invading forces in Assaults throughout Battle for Azeroth’s outdoor zones. Sabotage the enemy airship, take out the commander, and earn loot and Artifact power to prepare for new conflicts.<br />
New Island Expeditions: New islands Jorundall and Havenswood add more variety, and new events and activities like Azerite ruptures and Azerite extractors deepen the gameplay.<br />
New Raid: Battle for Dazar’alor: War crashes upon the shores of Zandalar in a new 9-boss raid in the Zandalari trolls’ capital. Battle Horde and Alliance leaders such as High Tinker Mekkatorque and King Rastakhan in faction-themed encounters. You’ll also participate from the other faction’s perspective.<br />
The War Campaign Continues<br />
New Heritage Armor for Blood Elves and Dwarves<br />
Tides of Vengeance Systems Updates<br />

​Azerite Armor Improvements<br />
Dubloon vendor<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
&lt;iframe width=&quot;900&quot; height=&quot;506&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/HLKS0Jq9U_E&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;<br />
<br />
After the main content of Tides of Vengeance rolls out, we’ll have more content to share in a minor content update to follow, including:<br />
<br />
New Allied Races<br />
Players will be able to earn their way toward gaining two new Allied races - the Zandalari Trolls and Kul Tiran Humans.<br />
<br />
Zandalari Trolls<br />
Enemies attack on their borders as well as unrest on the council threatens the foundation of the kingdom. By returning stability to Zandalar, the heroes of the Horde can gain this powerful new ally.<br />
<br />
Their racial abilities lean heavily on their love of the Loa and dinosaurs.<br />
<br />
Racial Traits:<br />
<br />
Regeneratin’- Concentrate to heal quickly over a short time.<br />
Embrace the Loa- Pray to Loa and gain their favor.<br />
City of Gold- Loot additional coin from monsters.<br />
Pterrodax Swoop- Call upon a pterrodax to glide to the ground.<br />
<br />
<br />
Available classes: druid, hunter, mage, monk, paladin, priest, rogue, shaman, warrior.<br />
<br />
Their druid forms are also heavily influenced by the dinosaurs they live with. They will be in full Zandalari style in their own heritage armor as they ride their new dinosaur mount – of course.<br />
<br />
Kul Tiran Humans<br />
One of the most interesting human cultures we’ve encountered, the Kul Tirans are fearless explorers, capable seafarers and incredible shipwrights. Their skills and fortitude will be vital for overcoming Sylvanas’ Horde.<br />
<br />
Their racial abilities reflect the Kul Tiran spirit of adventure and love of the sea. Here where their racials stand right now, but we’ll be looking for your feedback once they make it to the PTR.<br />
<br />
Racial Traits:<br />
<br />
Haymaker – Punch an enemy, stunning and knocking them back.<br />
Brush it Off – Increase versatility and regenerate damage.<br />
Jack of all Trades – Increases skill in all trade skills.<br />
Child of the Sea – Hold your breath longer and swim faster.<br />
Rime of the Ancient Mariner – Resistant to frost and nature damage.<br />
<br />
<br />
Available classes: druid, hunter, monk, priest, rogue, shaman, warrior<br />
<br />
Druids forms will also be specialized for this new Allied Race and their appearance are inspired by the Drust. Of course, everyone needs a noble steed and there’s no nobler than the horses from the Kul Tiran stables. This new Allied Race will look sharp in their heritage armor as they travel Azeroth.<br />
<br />
The Darkmoon Faire’s New Ride<br />
Silas Darkmoon like every great amusement park tycoon is always looking for new ways to get more visitors to the Darkmoon Faire. Realizing there was something missing from his island he’s adding a roller coaster. You’ll be able to experience it first hand assuming his engineers can get all the kinks worked out.<br />
<br />
Holiday Updates<br />
We love our holidays as much as you do and it’s been a while since we made updates to many of them, so we’re working to update many of them over time. We’re starting with Children’s Week and have added questlines for both Zandalari and Kul Tiran orphans. We’re also adding a few new micro-holidays to the calendar including: The Wanderer’s Festival, Vash’jir Diving, and maybe a T-Shirt Day to celebrate all things t-shirt with your fellow enthusiasts. We’re still sorting that one out, but it will be awesome.<br />
<br />
Timewalking Expands to Warlords of Draenor<br />
We’re also expanding our Timewalking Dungeon offerings to include Warlords of Draenor. You’ll be able to take on Auchindoun, Bloodmaul Slag Mines, Shadowmoon Burial Grounds, Skyreach, Iron Docks, and The Everbloom once more and collect some maximum level rewards and even a couple of new mounts.<br />
<br />
Portal Rooms<br />
To help travelers find their way to all the places their adventures take them throughout Azeroth, we’re introducing portal rooms within Orgrimmar and Stormwind. These will serve as a hub for all the various portals that heroes are sent through. We’ll be starting small at first and integrating some of the more important places. We’re building in such a way that we can add to the portal room in the future without having to look for a new nook to squeeze one in.<br />
<br />
Professions Questlines<br />
Profession updates in the content update will focus on unique questlines for each of the crafting professions that will allow them to collect a special tool to aid them in their craft. For example, scribes might gain a quill that they can use to create blood contracts that are special inscription items that drains the life of those around them.<br />
<br />
The Brawler’s Guild Returns<br />
It seems that in every expansion there’s a time in which the Brawler’s Guild needs to shut its doors in order to train up its combatants. As players get stronger, so must the brawlers. The time is coming for the Brawler’s Guild to return with a few additional changes.<br />
<br />
<br />
Revised tier progression<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
New Bosses<br />
<br />
Momma Stormstout<br />
Philip Carter Tracey<br />
Robe-Robber Robert<br />
Tidemistress Shellbreaker<br />
Zaxx Dreadslice<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
We also wanted to explore the idea of a new questline as related to the Brawler’s Guild. It starts with a murder… and as a member of the Brawler’s Guild you’ll be charged with solving a murder mystery the only way you know how by punching your way to the truth.<br />
<br />
Of course, there will also be new rewards to be earned like shirts! So very many shirts. And if you’ve always wanted to ride Bruce around, here’s your chance with the new mount.<br />
<br />
Warsong Gulch and Arathi Basin Remastered<br />
Our level designers, artists, and PvP designers have been hard at work remastering both Warsong Gulch and Arathi Basin. As you might expect, while we’re making things look better, we’re also working diligently to maintain the spirit of PvP balance of the original battlegrounds.<br />
<br />
For those who have been shy about stepping into a PvP battleground against other players, through the magic of our AI technology currently being used with Islands, you can play through a new brawl against AI opponents.<br />
<br />
Character Model Updates<br />
For those who enjoy a green cast to their skin or get a little fury when the moon is full, there are new model updates in the works. Yes, Goblin and Worgen model updates are coming.<br />
<br />
Beyond Tides of Vengeance<br />
We leave off our story in Tides of Vengeance with the conclusion of the Dazar’alor Raid dungeon. While the Alliance has struck a decisive blow, it’s not without some casualties. With both sides reeling from the events they are looking for the next opportunity to get a leg up on the war between the two factions. As the two lick their wounds, it's now that the naga make their move and begin strikes.<br />
<br />
Taking any remaining ships, the Horde and Alliance ultimately arrive in the ancient land of Nazjatar: the land of the naga and the location of Azshara’s power for our next content update –Rise of Azshara.<br />
<br />
Nazjatar<br />
Delve into the depths of Nazjatar, capital city of the naga, in an all-new full zone far beneath the sea, and set foot in this fabled area for the first time in WoW history. This is a large zone with new story quests, new and interesting friends and allies to meet and befriend, new foes to overcome, a variety of replayable outdoor content, and new rewards to earn including new mounts and even a baby naga!<br />
<br />
Everything culminates at Azshara's palace where players will face her in her seat of power.<br />
<br />
New Raid: Azshara’s Eternal Palace<br />
Confront the soldiers of Nazjatar, unfathomable monstrosities, and ultimately the legendary Queen Azshara in this sprawling 8-boss raid upon the nagas’ stronghold.<br />
<br />
<br />
8 Bosses<br />
Naga Hatchery<br />
Underwater Boss?<br />
Azshara<br />
<br />
<br />
Mechagon<br />
A mystery awaits that is of particular interest to the gnomes and goblins. A previously closed vault in Kul Tiras has opened and within it a radio transmitter sends a signal for help and points to a new land to explore, Mechagon. This is an ancient lost city of the gnomes. The beginning of the adventure is within the Junker Wastes where heroes will be beset by death robots, but there are potential allies nearby. Hunted by robots themselves, the mechagnomes introduce you to a whole new society and take you to where higher cast gnomes live who have dedicated themselves to their king and have embraced robotics.<br />
<br />
King Mechangon has a vision to return anyone of flesh into more pure robotic parts and it's up to you to put a stop to him.<br />
<br />
Mechagon Megadungeon<br />
Explore a sprawling new dungeon and face the dangers within.<br />

Sharding in WoW Classic Demo<br />
Guys calm down! (No Sharding thread)<br />
As you've noticed, the Classic Demo does have realm sharding. This is to let as many people as possible experience it without technical issues such as server capacity or spawn density getting in the way. <br />
<br />
Longer term, we know how crucial it is to the Classic experience for you to see your friends when you walk into Stormwind or when you’re helping them on a quest you’ve already completed. And there should only ever be one Kazzak on a realm, no matter how many people are waiting for him to spawn.<br />
<br />
We’re still looking at how we can best deliver an authentic Classic experience at launch, and in the weeks and months that follow - both in terms of gameplay and community. You won’t see phasing (which is tied to specific quests that don't exist in Classic) or cross-realm zones (which combine multiple realms together) in Classic. However, realm sharding is one of the best tools we have to keep realms stable when hundreds of players are swarming the same initial few zones and killing the same few mobs (like they will be at the launch of Classic). To that end, we do believe that some form of sharding may be helpful, especially in those early days. But we recognize that a cohesive world is critical to WoW Classic and are committed to bringing that to you.<br />
<br />
<br />
WoW Classic Demo Behavior<br />
Playing the Classic Demo<br />
As an additional note for your awareness, any behavior that would result in a player being suspended from the WoW Classic Demo will also cause them to be suspended from the live game. This includes suspensions for things like naming violations.<br />
<br />

You know what, I've no issue with code.org for all the wokeness they attract. They're going right to the source of the issue with the lack of women in Comp Sci, by appealing to the younger generations, rather that just trying to force current companies to hire a unproportional amount of female graduates that don't currently exist.<br />
<br />
code.org are a good organisation.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They pretend that women not preferring to join the sciences is a problem. Their whole goal is meaningless. It doesn't matter what genitals the person who did your coding has. It doesn't matter what skin color your game designer has. Their entire mission reinforces sexist and racist thinking. People can pursue whatever kind of career they want, and if that results in uneven representation in any given field, there's nothing wrong with that.</div></div><hr />

The whole idea that you have to force increased participation is inherently wrong. If people don't want to do something then let them have that choice. If that ends up skewing &quot;representation&quot; then that isn't a problem.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I do agree that code.org is a bit of a strange choice (you can't force people to love computer science) but considering the fact that Blizz just gave 12million to cancer research, going to cancer again would definitely not be the right way either (you can only throw so much money at it).<br />
<br />
Probably would have been better off with Make a wish, or some children related thing IMO (isn't there a children related gaming charity thing?)</div></div><hr />

It was probably the best designed WoD dungeon (minus turret boss), unlike Bloodmaul with tedious trash and boring bosses.</div></div><hr />

It's about forcing people to like something. You can't. It doesn't work. <br />
<br />
It's about encouraging people to engage in something that they are good at but have been otherwise been discouraged from doing because it's seen as not welcoming. This is something that the industry has been struggling with since the beginning. As a white guy in my 50s, I can attest to it.<br />

<br />
Probably would have been better off with Make a wish, or some children related thing IMO (isn't there a children related gaming charity thing?)<br />

There are so many kinds of cancer, i doubt the research on every one of them is founded well. And there are so many other diseases that, even if they don't kill you, can make your life very miserable.<br />
I usually try to solve the worst problems first before i take care of the smaller things but well, it's their money, they can spend it how they want.<br />
I, for my part, won't buy the yeti.</div></div><hr />

I agree. It's a shame that prostate cancer doesn't get the same attention.</div></div><hr />
