Kill credit for the Tol Barad bonus quest bosses will now be granted to players who have helped attack them, even if they are not in the same group. These bosses include Problim, Archmage Galus, Warden Silva, and Svarnos.<br />
The Farson Keep Prisoner summoned for the quest &quot;Walk A Mile In Their Shoes&quot; (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/28065/walk-a-mile-in-their-shoes/) will now only be visible to the player who summoned him.<br />

Cataclysm Hotfixes - Updated Jan. 6<br />
Here you will find a list of hotfixes that address various issues related to the release of patch 4.0.3a and World of Warcraft: Cataclysm. While many have already been deployed on all realms, some may not be implemented until the next time your realm is restarted. We will continue to update this thread in the days ahead as additional hotfixes are applied.<br />

<br />
Ghouls do not gain Shadow Infusion when Death Coil is cast during the preparation phase of an Arena or rated Battleground match, making it impossible to use Dark Transformation before the game starts. Shadow Infusion and Dark Transformation both work normally after the preparation phase.<br />
<br />

<br />
Hunters can no longer sometimes activate multiple aspects at once through the use of Camouflage. Very sneaky.<br />

<br />
Paladins using Divine Shield are now able to cast on targets within the same Smoke Bomb effect area, as well as heal others.<br />

Casting Flash Heal while under the effects of both Surge of Light and Inner Focus will now only consume Surge of Light.<br />

<br />
Warriors can no longer teleport when using Charge with the Tahret Dynasty Mallet.<br />
<br />
<br />
Dungeons &amp; Raids<br />
The Bastion of Twilight<br />
<br />
It is no longer possible to outrange the Halfus Wyrmbreaker drakes without being attacked by melee. The drakes now reposition themselves correctly in order to regain the capability to melee the target.<br />
Twilight Phase-Twister's Twist Phase ability now has an initial cast delay of 7 seconds, up from 5, and a cast time of roughly 8 seconds, up from 6.<br />
<br />
<br />
Blackrock Caverns<br />
<br />
The Evolution aura during the Corla encounter now displays its warning visual on players at 74 stacks, instead of 82.<br />
<br />
<br />
Deadmines<br />
<br />
Shapeshifted characters should no longer be unable to jump on the rope during the Vanessa VanCleef encounter. They will now be pulled out of a shapeshift form automatically. In addition, players should no longer lose pets when jumping on the rope (they will respawn when the player lands after swinging). Please note that until a client-side patch can be applied, an inappropriate aura will be displayed when pet classes or shapeshifted characters use the rope. The tooltip of this aura will read &quot;Delicious Aura (UNUSED REUSE) / Instant / Delicious food increases haste by 10%&quot; and can be disregarded, as it does not provide a haste buff. It's an aura of free word association... Enjoy!<br />
<br />
<br />
Lost City of the Tol'vir<br />
<br />
Tamed Tol'vir Prowlers now have regular loot and Skinning tables, instead of epic-quality loot.<br />
<br />
<br />
Throne of the Four Winds<br />
<br />
Al'akir's Static Shock now does 5,000 damage and only interrupts the spell the player is casting at that moment. It doesn't lock out the caster and only casts every 5 seconds or so.<br />
<br />
<br />
Items<br />
<br />
Darkmoon Card: Tsunami now properly procs Giant Wave when basic heal-over-time spells are cast.<br />
<br />

Demolishers now spawn at about the same moment that the boats reach the docks in the second round.<br />
<br />
<br />
Tol Barad<br />
<br />
If a player is already in Tol Barad and does not join the battle, the player will be ported back to the camp.<br />
Using /afk ejects players out of the raid and back to the camp.<br />
Entering Tol Barad via the bridge during an active battle by joining the queue will port the player to the correct starting place of the battle, but players who do not join the queue will be ported back to the camp.<br />
Both the Hellscream's Reach Battle Standard and the Baradin's Wardens Battle Standard now have a 10-minute cooldown.<br />
<br />
<br />
Quests &amp; Creatures<br />
Tol Barad<br />
<br />
The spawn rates of all three Tol Barad quest micro dungeons have been adjusted to a more reasonable level. This should alleviate the issues players were having with creatures respawning too quickly.<br />
The escorted Farson Keep Prisoner for the quest &quot;Walk A Mile In Their Shoes&quot; no longer engages in combat with opposing faction players.<br />
<br />
<br />
Twilight Highlands<br />
<br />
If reinforcements are not called after 60 seconds, Skullcrusher the Mountain will now despawn. When reinforcements are called, Skullcrusher no longer improperly despawns.<br />

I hope I can solve these 8500+ Night Elf fragments I have saved up before the patch that removes them. Maybe I wouldn't have had so many if the drop rate on Recipe: Vial of Sands was a teensy bit more reasonable than the 7-10% it's clearly at now.<br />

Most epic artefacts only drop at a certain skill level, you skill up using only artefacts from races that offer crap and save up the ones you need for the epic. Looks like i'm leveling arche on 2 more toons sooner than i expected.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What needs to be fixed with Archeology? If you think the drop rate of some epics is too low or frustating, then its not blizzard's fault. If you think about bugs such as the capricious survey that sometimes point back to where you already survey'd, then maybe its in one of the many bugs, handled them , section.</div></div><hr />

Also for easier archeology leveling, till digsites turn grey, you simply don't solve anything and you can easily over the 200 fragments then.</div></div><hr />

And don't get to happy with &quot;You will keep fragments until further notice.&quot;. That only means that you will keep them till they add something new into that specific race, then they will wipe them just before that.<br />
If the guy, that invented archaeology just had a bigger brain than a hippogryph, he might have added alot more rares to nelf, vrykul and fossil and no one would have had 1000+ of each.<br />
In some way I think it's more fun to see those fragments stack up, rather than having a cap at 200.<br />
Would make it even more boring to grind Tol'vir.<br />

Add some god damn item, that can drop in any dig, that will give yourself a chance to change a digsite into whatever digsite you want. How many of you out there are actually fishing for firefin snappers nowdays? I mean, anyone know that tol'vir can only be found in Uldum.

Archaeology<br />
<br />
Archaeology fragments now have a hard cap of 200 per race. Players will not be able to collect additional fragments until they complete artifacts to take them down below 200 fragments. Players with more than 200 fragments will not lose additional fragments in 4.0.6, but in a future patch we may remove any fragments above 200.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Does this mean we'll stop getting dig sites for the races for which we own 2000+, oh.. yeah.. sorry 200+ fragments? Or does it just mean we get screwed even more? And what's the point of forcing us to complete common solves for races from which we can't get any rare any more, when they said they would keep adding additional items from archaeology in future patches.<br />
<br />
We get screwed even more I bet. Can't see why they want us easier chance of getting the most rare items.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I wonder how Blizzard think about troll. Sure, every step till you have all common artifacts is lore. But I doubt there are many archaeologists that use troll fragments at all, except for leveling it. But my guess is even more save it for 450+ to get Zin'rokh.<br />
If they added other funstuff TILL 450, then alot less would save the troll fragments. Do Blizzard have a special department with employees with diffrent sicknessess that actually create some of the content? I'm sure they have archaeology then.</div></div><hr />

How is it an exploit? There wasn't a bug with the game to exploit. Blizzard may not have intended for us to hoard fragments to such an extent but that does not make it an exploit.<br />
<br />
Secondly, how does the post you quoted make it sound like a whining post anyway? vreid may not like the change but is going to do something about it by increasing efforts made to get the item(s) wanted before the change becomes live.

An exploit? Are you an idiot or something? It's not any different than a cook collecting all food he finds, even that which he can't cook because his skill is to low.<br />
<br />
No, the only reason for this change is because they made a stupid profession that send you to areas to digg for shit you have no use for, but you still have to do it to potentially get a digsite in an area you actually need.<br />
They want to add more things to the races but noticed that instead of wasting time solving crap they don't want, the players just stack it instead. They just slap players in the face who thought further than they did. It has nothing to do with bugging out or bypassing features/mechanics in the game.<br />
Blizzard just won't admit they made an error or a badly planned profession and let the playerbase suffer for it.</div></div><hr />

I can't really see how you can see this as an exploit? Blizzard didn't hard-cap the artifacts, hence you could save them for something later on.<br />

Oh yeah, the uh, archaeology thing sorta stinks... I couldn't stand to hoard pieces, though. It would just end up taking me longer to solve the stuff as I would have to collect more fragments and not solve 'em. I just solved all on the fly (after 100).<br />
<br />
What they really should do to help out is keep all fragments green up through 525. At least give folks a -tiny- chance of skilling up off of the fragments. It'd help out a bunch. Once I realised that I mis-read the Vrykul bearded ax and noticed it was NOT an 85 epic but a level 80 226 ax, I was a lot less excited about my archaeology progress...<br />

I don't see why there would be two separate tailor made pants for dps casters, and none for healers.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also related to that matter. There is a severe lack of healer cloth epic items from reputation vendors. There is currently only 1 item (belt from Hyjal faction) for healers. While there are 3 caster dps epic epic items on various other faction vendors. Was this intentional?</div></div><hr />

Probably not, Blizzard has gotten away with this throughout Wows lifespan. They have just become more blatant about it now.<br />

Gonna go ahead and say this is just common sense. More often than not, you just get a ton of people standing there spamming AE abilities to tag the mob. If the people are smart, they end up joining group for 10 seconds while they kill the target.<br />

Hammer of Justice interrupts, but so does Avenger's Shield. I would advise reviewing the tooltip of Avenger's Shield here:<br />
<br />
Avenger's Shield at wowhead (can't post links for some reason)<br />
You can see in the spell details section, that the second effect reads the following:<br />
Effect#2	Interrupt Cast<br />
<br />
Now check Rebuke's spell effects for comparison.<br />
Rebuke at wowhead (can't post links for some reason)<br />
Effect	Interrupt Cast<br />
<br />
Essentially, I welcome this change while tanking, because Avenger's Shield is a staple tool for threat, and I hate to save it for 2 reasons, first being the aforementioned use in threat (which isn't that big of a deal), and secondly that it is on the global cooldown! If I am caught in autopilot spamming skill after skill I will end up missing faster casting mobs, or it will just be cooling down. Rebuke being baseline is a very welcome change.</div></div><hr />

Would have been nice to have had it last night - it woulda ding'd me over to Revered so I could buy the dam tank helm :P The quest was #8 on the &quot;most popular problems&quot; list last night. But, so much for that, I went to sleep and whatya know, they think they've fixed it.<br />
<br />
But Archaeology, what a bummer :( Glad I technically only have to do it on one character. Or, is it only one character per server? Dang it; gotta figure that part out :(</div></div><hr />

In the ideal world everything in wow would be to be discovered by the players, by experience, rumours and hearsay. <br />
<br />
Anyway, the change is good imo<br />
<br />
Yeah right, and yet here you are. On one of the most spoiling sites about WoW content out there. If you wouldn't have been on this page reading up on upcomming changes and things comming you wouldn't have commented on it to begin <br />
<br />
And what else, the most people that complains about this are those that have mostly discovered evert grey crap item you can get from the common races. <br />
They just get things stacked up from digging, they don't wanna waste time creating junk because Blizzard have a profession that send people around digging in random areas i hope to get a digsite in an area they want.<br />
<br />
I bet you yourself will be one of those complaining once you start wishing that next digsite popping up on your map will be Tol'Vir and not NE/Fossil site number 1000+</div></div><hr />
