Extended downtime for May 6th &amp; Patch 2.4.2<br />
Let's start with the beginning, Patch 2.4.2 probably won't be deployed today. However US realms do have an extended maintenance from 03:00 AM to 11:00 AM PDT.<br />
May 5th, 2008 8:10pm PDT<br />
We will be performing extended maintenance for all realms on Tuesday, May 6th. The downtime will begin at 3:00am PDT and end at approximately 11:00am PDT.<br />
About Patch 2.4.2, Hortus posted a message to inform people that the testing of the patch was complete ...<br />
We will be taking the 2.4.2 PTR down shortly and ending the 2.4.2 PTR phase. <br />
... followed by a post to explain that 2.4.2 testing on PTR would be extended, this was probably caused by a serious bug found at the last minute and there is pretty much no chance to see the patch deployed on live servers this week.<br />
We have decided to put the 2.4.2 PTR up for some additional testing. The realms should once again be available for play. <br />
It also means that the patch is almost complete, and it wouldn't be surprising to see it on live servers next week. Anyway, we do have a long maintenance in front of us and you might want to read the 2.4.2 related posts to be ready for the patch once it's ready. <br />

I'm pretty sure Kungen will say something in the lines of &quot; only end bosses matter! &quot; or some crappy shit like that, and no, i am not from the US, i am from Europe, just not a big nihilum fan as i never tought they were anything special ^^<br />
<br />
edit: nice to see druids involved in the kill aswell :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
Edit: Nihilum won't care about thier kill, they care ONLY about world 1st or EU 1st. Since SK Gaming owned M'uru, Nihilum does carebears. Anyway I think they will bring Kil'Jaeden down as 1st.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Duffbeans</div><div class="date">2008-05-06, 11:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok every EU guild out there are whining about stacked raids or whatever.<br />
<br />
Ill make some things clear.<br />
<br />
We started 6PM today, which means we STARTED ON TIME LIKE PROS. We had TWO ROFL enhancement shamans,AND 4 roguez online. That's the only reason we USED 2 melee groupZ. I had to FUCKING call under geared casuals on their cellphones to ROOT US ON for the raid. The setup we had is far from optimal both class wise and gear wise. Ill say it again, we only made a CASTER group and two MELEE groups since we DON'T LIKE FUCKING HUNTERS. On the next kill we'll most likely have 2 HUNTER GROUPS AND 8 HUNTERS TOTAL.<br />
<br />
We raided around 10 hours the first day on the MURU and we didn't even beat p1. We used the wrong strategy, just as all other guilds out there seem to do .<br />
<br />
TONIGHT we came back with a THE SAME FUCKING STRAT and got to P2 in a few tries, then we killed them after 9HOURSLOL. The 5 tries before our kill was basically 110% kills and 25 man alive in p2. We just wiped cause of WORLD SECOUND US FIRST NERVES, whole raid going panic mode at low % .<br />
<br />
Either way, total spent was around PROBABLY LESS THEN NIHILUM LOL hours. Which is way less then all NILHILUM guilds out there. Get over yourself NHILIUM, you just suck.<br />
<br />
Also there is nothing random in the encounter, we can beat it every single try, we do not need some special magical try. If you need that then you're doing it wrong. Trust me.<br />
<br />
We used 6 healers, 4 tanks and 15 dps. We can use 3 healers, 17 hunter dps and whatever else you want us to use the next kill and still own it. We just took the raid we had online, believed in it and kicked ass. It's not harder then that.<br />
<br />
Personally I believe we have the best FUCKING dps in the world by far, we can always use more healers then needed and never have any issues with Enrage timers.<br />
<br />
PS: STILL 5 glaives. (LOL)<br />

<br />
This is just wipe,wipe,wipe for 9 hours solid. Finally work out how to beat the dumb scripted AI (it wouldn't be scripted if there weren't phases), brag to other guilds.<br />

On the other hand what Nihilum did when ploughing through TK was impressive as it was so fast. Playing 9-12 hours isn't really to me.</div></div><hr />
