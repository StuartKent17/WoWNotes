I'm pretty sure people are excited that he is finally up again because he drops the rank 3 recipe of prolonged power pots. Since prolonged power is pretty much the go to combat potion for most specs now, this should drop the price for these potions on the ah even if only slightly.</div></div><hr />

Yes, this is exactly the reason.</div></div><hr />

Yeah it's sad ain't it. All my friends quit because they wanted prolonged rank 3 so badly and couldn't take it any more... Some of them wanted the sweet 860 gear to replace their 930 pieces too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, at the cost of not being a cool kid and taking things incredibly foolishly, I imagine he ment the fact they couldn't be asse'd to fix this simple af problem says alot about the quality of the game right now. Not much outside of game breaking raid encounters seem to warrent attention anymore, and many could see that as reason enough to quit. <br />
<br />
But thats just my guess.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My guess is that now we have the Broken Shore boss that pops for 900, and also the world 'portal' boss each week for 930, it would be a bit redundant.<br />
<br />
Having said that, they raised the WQs, so my guess seems completely off haha!</div></div><hr />
