Viewer’s Guide: Mythic Dungeon International Spring Season<br />
The Mythic Dungeon International (MDI) is a global tournament where the top dungeon-running teams in the world use their skill, intelligence, and creativity to secure the best times possible in some of the most difficult Mythic Dungeons on offer. We are entering the first tournament of the year, the MDI Spring Season, so here’s a breakdown of what you need to know!<br />
<br />
Many Turtles Made It To the Water<br />
We opened the Proving Grounds and thousands of players around the world answered the call, completing five different level 14 Mythic Keystone Dungeons to earn their spot on the Tournament Realm. These players will have the chance every second week to compete in the Time Trials for their region, West (North America, Latin America, and Europe) and East (China, Korea, Southeast Asia, Taiwan, Australia and New Zealand). The dungeons and affixes are different for each Time Trial, offering new challenges and fresh chances to make the week’s Top 8, which will be broadcast live in the following languages:<br />
<br />

<br />
Each Cup will give players a chance to get their share of USD $12,000 prize money and MDI points. The top point-earning teams from the East and West will combine in a live, cross-regional, in-person Spring Season LAN final in June. This LAN offers a share of USD $100,000 in prize money, as well as a coveted place at the MDI Global Finals. We’ll share more details about the MDI Spring Season’s finals soon!<br />

<br />
The bald and beautiful Ted “Sloot” Bacinschi (https://twitter.com/Slootbag) has been playing World of Warcraft since the early days. He’s been raiding just as long, if you count stepping foot in Zul’Gurub, getting to the first boss and wiping over and over again. Sloot isn’t just a tank on the desk, he’s also a tank extraordinaire in game as a master of many tank specializations. An iconic figure in the North American and European PvE scenes, you can often find him streaming.<br />
<br />
Hailing from Italy, Caroline “Naguura” Forer (https://twitter.com/NaguraWoW) has come a long way from waiting for her brothers to get off the computer so she could log in and play her Paladin back in Classic. “When I couldn't play, I would just sit for hours and watch my brothers play, then jump straight on as soon as they left the chair,” she said. From Paladin to Druid and from healing to damage, Caroline grew up with the game and went on to establish herself at the core of the EU PvE scene. Now with years of experience, a multitude of World Firsts under her belt and her own forays into WoW esports (both competing and casting), she returns to the MDI casting team.<br />
<br />
Daniel &quot;AutomaticJak&quot; Azenberger (https://twitter.com/AutomaticJak) has been raiding in World of Warcraft for many years and is perhaps most well-known for his healing guides on YouTube (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzFK2Yn2gu20AWV1raNbiOQ) and Wowhead, where he specializes in Holy/Discipline Priest and Mistweaver Monk play. He has been creating guides for over five years and enjoys sharing his knowledge and love of healing, so if you’re a healer looking to step up your game, or a tank/DPS looking to understand your healers more, AutomaticJak’s is the voice that will help you do that during MDI.<br />
<br />
Aaron &quot;Sours&quot; Shaffer (https://twitter.com/classicsours) is a former competitor who played Hunter in the second Tespa Great Collegiate Dungeon Race in 2016 and MDI 2017. He then transitioned into casting, helping to bring North American and Chinese MDI to your screens, as well as taking on a role as an analyst at the first ever MDI LAN. He hopes to help highlight the skill and talent of the world’s best dungeon runners. His advice to the competitors is to &quot;focus on your own game—it's not about who makes the first mistake in a race, it's about who makes the last&quot;. His goal with the MDI program is for viewers to appreciate the time and effort that competitors put into optimizing their play when they stand at the top of the world.<br />
<br />
Former captain of the 4-man MDI team Sinking Ship, and self-proclaimed #2 Balance Druid, Peyton “Tettles” Tettleton’s (https://www.twitch.tv/tettles) appearance on the MDI desk will be one for the ages. Overall, his goal for the broadcast is to help viewers understand what makes the runs successful. “There is a lot of nuance in Mythic Plus and being able to teach the path to victory for each team is important,” he said. You can catch him on his stream or on YouTube (https://www.youtube.com/user/Tettlesbaby/videos) where he primarily focuses on PVE content. He also authors the Wowhead Balance Druid Guide. He loves a good-natured meme and ridiculous photos of himself photoshopped.<br />
<br />
Rounding out the MDI desk team, Alex &quot;Xyronic&quot; Tatge (https://twitter.com/XyronicWoW) is an Affliction Warlock extraordinaire. You can find his guides on Wowhead, where he breaks down everything a master of shadow magic would need to know, from talent builds, Azerite gear, spell rotations, macros and addons, Mythic+ guides, and more!<br />
<br />
After existing for years as an invitational tournament, the Mythic Dungeon International is not just an expanded, worldwide, merit-based tournament—it’s a thank you to all the fans of dungeon running around the globe. We can’t wait to get started. To stay on top of Time Trial results each week and the MDI Cups, check out Raider.IO (https://raider.io/), and be sure to follow us on Twitter (https://www.twitter.com/Warcraft) and Twitch (https://www.twitch.tv/Warcraft). We’ll see you in chat!<br />

Asia-Pacific Enters the Arena<br />
While the Arena World Championships (AWC) are taking a break in North America and Europe before their LAN finals, it’s time for Asia-Pacific to get in on the action.<br />
<br />
AWC Korea, AWC Australia/New Zealand, and AWC Taiwan are kicking off soon, all adjusted from last year to fall in line with the points-based online cups of North America and Europe. These three tournaments will culminate in a live, cross-regional LAN finals in South Korea, which will take place September 28-29. There, the top three point-earning teams from ANZ, the top three point-earning teams from South Korea, and the top two point-earning teams from Taiwan will battle it out for a $36,000 prize pool, the title of APAC champions, and a spot at the AWC Global Finals.<br />
<br />
Signups for ANZ are open now (https://battlefy.com/world-of-warcraft-arena-world-championship), while signups for Korea and Taiwan open soon.

<br />
This one isn't one of them. <br />
<br />
And it's a damned shame, for such an iconic character. The pose is is just as bad as the face. The hooded pose from warbringinger would have been gorgeous. This looks like a generic mobile game female caster pose, like they took 3D clip art and morphed Jaina stuff onto it - and forgot the face. <br />
<br />
Seems to be a theme with Blizzard these days - build you up with hype...and then let you down in a soulkilling manner.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Esper</div><div class="date">2019-03-29, 10:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The statue would look better if they HAD outsourced it to some Japanese company to make it.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trumpcat</div><div class="date">2019-03-29, 10:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is no a Jaina statue. This is a statue of someone wearing Jaina's clothes. And it is not a cosplayer either because they do better job with makeup to resemble the character. This face has different jaw line, mouth, eyebrows, eyes and nose. Aka all the main features of a face. Jaina doesn't even wear lipstick. <br />
<br />
Incredibly disappointed because if this looked like Jaina at least a bit, I would buy it. She is my favorite character.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BlakeArt</div><div class="date">2019-03-29, 11:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Seriously, an editor validated her face ? I mean, com'on, it's beautiful, but that's not Jaina, simply as that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you were to read the announcement, you would notice that they speak of extending it beyond its original deadline after considering feedback and evaluating the current azerite levels in the community. So it was scheduled to end this week, and then they decided to extend it. How is that so confusing? :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
that was on our end, we knew it was ending based on code in the game it was set to end this week for along time, but entering this week they noticed alot of people are still under leveled and are going to keep increasing it<br />
blizzard then today said &quot;oh yeah its going to continue&quot; as they are going to add morte levels<br />
<br />
i just hit 47 with no like &quot;days of doing islands&quot; so im all fine 1 more level then ive got all my traits</div></div><hr />

That statue is not an expertly crafted one.<br />

I could buy 3-7 Play Arts Kai figures for the cost of this single statue alone. And the Batman ones are pretty damn good.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That said, I can't say I'm a fan of the statue myself. The hair looks like they brushed yellow (blonde) over a white base coat making it look splotchy. The face is also off significantly. The Sylvanas one wasn't too accurate, either, but it eventually made it into cinematics so it had use. This Jaina statue is not what we see even in cinematics. I was going to preorder it after seeing it showcased at Blizzcon, but now I think I'll pass. I own the Sylvanas statue and was impressed by the quality, but not so much this one. I'm hoping for a Varian or an Anduin statue, but I'm hoping they'll be better than this one. Likely won't see one for another 2-4 years, though. A horde statue will likely be next.</div></div><hr />

I get where you're coming from, but that face is too far off the mark for a high-end $350 product. If it was something cheaper then it'd get more slack, but not for 350.<br />

<br />
Dva statue turned out great, the face made this one a miss though. Ehren was probably focused on a certain emotion from Jaina when making the face, like making her unwavering/confident, but as someone who buys a lot of statues, I prefer a recognizable face. Just my two cents. Not saying your opinion is invalid or anything. I know it sucks to make something as an artist and then see it trashed, but I do think Blizzard should have told her to change it internally before the final product (since she's in-house)</div></div><hr />

That is just an idiotic statement and a logical fallacy. You don't need to be able to do something else to find the fault with someone elses work.

<br />
Also what’s up with these 300+ dollar statues now? I have an Arthas and a Chen statue that are just as detailed and look fantastic and they were only 40 bucks. They’re smaller, sure but the detail is insane on them.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Boo Radley</div><div class="date">2019-03-30, 02:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">there's several problems with the statue's facial structure: <br />
<br />
1. They decided to go full-real life human when she's not meant to be. She's an avatar of a video game character, not an actual person. <br />
2. Chin too prominent<br />
3. Regarding the shape of her face, Jaina in cinematics has a &quot;kitten&quot; type of face (shorter and wider, with larger eyes for emphasis) whereas this statue uses the more elongated and narrower &quot;fox&quot; type. Both are widely accepted as attractive facial structures, personal preference usually determining which you believe to be better, but this is about accuracy not attractiveness.<br />
4. Her eyes are more prominent and cartoonish, you know, like a video game character. <br />
5. Her cheekbones are not as prominent and the cut of her cheeks not as drastic<br />
6. The jaw is essentially an invented feature(as far as its featured prominence) compared to the source material. I dont think I'd ever have said &quot;Jaina is quite a handsome woman&quot; before this statue.<br />
<br />
I really didnt want to nitpick but once I saw everyone complaining in here I went to see what the big deal is. After looking at it for 30 seconds those are my observations. Please feel free to let me know if you disagree with them, but do include why. It helps.</div></div><hr />

What?<br />
<br />
Listed at $335 for me when I click the link. That's $15 cheaper.<br />
<br />
And to be fair that at least includes an Elemental which looks pretty badass. Looks 1000x better than the crappy Blizzard one and is basically a statue and a half. And is taller.<br />
<br />
I'd actually support the fan made one with the Elemental as it look like actual effort went into it.<br />
<br />
Hell Play Arts Kai minions have more effort put into them than the $350 one and those look way better. And those are basically figures not statues.</div></div><hr />

i will not say that the Right one look better, since the blizzard store one, goes for a diferent style. But that one with Elemental cost 3 times more, i own it and with shippment costme almost 1k dollar. <br />

So yeah stop saying that cost 250$ only bc that is the prince of the elemental only.</div></div><hr />

Plus the asian version looks pretty... slutty, as almost all recent asian art is - whilist the portrayal of Jaina in BfA is a more of a mature look. If the asian one gets you off that's ok but that's not -Jaina- either, as she is -now-.<br />

Something you might see more in a more realstic looking cartoon or even real life, or a cross between the 2. <br />
The in game models are much more cartoon style. Something you would see airing after school or on the weekend (yes, I’m that old).<br />
I won’t say it’s bad, but I personally don’t like it because it doesn’t fit the in game art style. The style everyone associates with the game. If the art style was like this in game I doubt people would be so upset by it.<br />
That said, it still doesn’t look right as the difference of in game art style differs so much and I won’t buy it.</div></div><hr />

The price is also not the issue, that is actually bog standard these days and complaints with the quality based on the store photos is definitely misplaced. The only thing here at fault is the art itself, since that isn't really Jaina's as we've come to know her.</div></div><hr />

She was a WC2 character with next to no characterization to begin with, so BiS had over a decade to impose his own believes and ideals upon what Alleria was. When her personality was actually fleshed out and was different than his idealized version he'd been headcanoning for the past decade, he blames them.</div></div><hr />

If you swap &quot;how we envisioned it&quot; with &quot;how it's represented in 100% of blizzards own media.&quot; You'll see what people are talking about.<br />
It's literally not what the character looks like.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's not &quot;how we envisioned it&quot;, it is &quot;how Blizzard has shown her to us for the last 20 years.<br />
Even if the style changes - this is acceptable, it should at least look like the character in game / in cinematics.<br />
<br />
Illidan and Sylvanas didn't suffer this fate, hopefully. Pretty sure Jaina won't sell as well as the other two, for sure I won't be buying it (and God knows i'd buy it if it was neat).<br />
<br />
The one from the chinese thing linked earlier is so much closer to the source material... Too bad that's a 1k$ thing with probably 3 or 400$ duty taxes...</div></div><hr />

Layoffs and downsizing doesn’t always mean dire straits. Sometimes it’s getting rid of positions that are rendered obsolete by new technology, as well as positions that were once useful but no longer needed.<br />
Blizzard is still making money.<br />
My company used to have a specific position they hired for. They don’t do it anymore because another position already does that job as well as additional duties and it was more cost effective and cheaper to just not have those positions anymore.</div></div><hr />

Make one, sounds like it could be a decent thread.<br />

You must be new to figurines.. <br />
<br />
The price is also not the issue, that is actually bog standard these days and complaints with the quality based on the store photos is definitely misplaced. The only thing here at fault is the art itself, since that isn't really Jaina's as we've come to know her.<br />
I saw a video review about the Sylvanas statue and was shocked when the guy did a close-up and there was a visible chip/unpainted bit near her ear and the guy reported that he accidentally broke a couple of the arrows because they were so fragile. Completely turned me off from future statues from Blizzard. <br />
<br />
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icwZfAOwaVo can see the unfinished area in near the left ear in the 4:10 mark.</div></div><hr />

Maybe such a thread could be kept alive by big collectors? I only got one figure, n after its cost + delivery, hard to want a collection going...<br />
<br />
<br />

Wanted a conan one or maybe or some dinosaur too<br />
<br />
I checked out sideshow's figures n the prices are too much today...<br />
That Grom one is neat but expensive..<br />
I mean it's the double price at least of the red sonja one...<br />

<br />
I'd love to make a thread about figures, but how to prevent mod to lock it if it hasn't been posted in a while?</div></div><hr />

Not seeing the chipped part, but it I can agree with the guy in the video, it definitely looks delicate. I'd definitely have concerns regarding shipping.<br />
<br />
Also these statues have the bad habit of coming with varying degrees of quality, which makes this a quite frustrating and expensive hobby I guess. I only have 3 from some game CEs but I follow the market a bit out of curiosity. I'm still pissed that the one from my skyrim CE came with alduin badly assembled (it's apparently a multi part mold which they glue together) to the point that he won't properly fit the stand. One of these days I will need to carefully go in there and dissolve the glue and assemble it properly..</div></div><hr />
