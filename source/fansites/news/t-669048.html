Today, Premonition (http://premoguild.com/forums/portal.php) (US-Sen'jin) completed one of the hardest achievement available in the Trial of the Grand Crusader : A Tribute to Insanity (25 Player) (http://db.mmo-champion.com/a/3819/a-tribute-to-insanity-25-player/). Congratulations to them.

Blue posts<br />
Ulduar closed on PTRs<br />
This is correct. There are many servers that have not had a realm first kill on Algalon, and in order to prevent extra attempts per week we have Ulduar closed on the PTR. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/13/19820506397-why-is-uldaur-down-for-ptr.html))<br />
<br />
Earth, Wind and Fire<br />
We don't feel that just because an achievement is difficult that it needs to have a big reward associated with it. If you will only do something because you will gain something specific like a title/mount then doing every achievement may not be for you. Some others like to do extra things that challenge them in a different way and change up their game play for a few days/attempts which is pretty much what this achievement accomplishes. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/20/19820414934-earth-wind-and-fire.html)) <br />
<br />
Brewfest updated to Level 80<br />
Indeed, Brewfest has been updated for level 80, and you should see the return of some quests that went missing last year. I'll be around should questions arise that I can field. :) However, the changes aren't extensive enough to warrant a round of PTR testing this time. <br />
<br />
1. Can you confirm or deny whether or not the Wolpertinger will be sold for gold this year or tickets?<br />
For our region, the quest should be back.<br />
<br />
2. Can you confirm or deny whether any of the pieces of clothing will be able to be sold back to the vendor for a ticket refund like the one piece of clothing from Midsummer? <br />
As the tickets are part of the token system I believe the refund functionality will be there. <br />
<br />
I have all the items the horseman drops (level 70 ones) I was wondering if the items themselves will be updated to 80 versions, or will I have to get a new 80 version through a drop?<br />
Any new items will be just that: new items that you will have to acquire. It wouldn't be fair to those who haven't leveled since they received those items to bump them up and potentially make them unusable. <br />
<br />
Brewfest Mount Droprate and Coren Direbrew<br />
No, but as others have pointed out, having the actual mount is no longer required for the achievement; you need only transform your mount with hops to get Have Keg, Will Travel. Due to this, I don't believe the drop rate of the mounts changed from the rate it was when Brewfest ended last year.<br />
<br />
As for questions regarding additions and such, as I mentioned earlier in the thread, there were no major changes or additions to the holiday, simply an update to what was already there. This means that Coren works the same way he did last year, and there are no new pets or mounts. We hope you'll have a good time in any case.

Intimidation and Kill Command<br />
I can't go into detail on all of them, but for starters Intimidation could be a lot better and Kill Command could be as fun as say Lock and Load instead of a macro'd ability. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/19820327060-hunter-mechanics-questions.html))<br />
<br />
Tranquilizing Shot<br />
We're not going to be in a big hurry to buff Tranq Shot. It might be a better way to go to nerf all dispels to something more like that so that they didn't trivially undo buffs, debuffs and CC. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/19820327060-hunter-mechanics-questions.html))<br />

Totem of Wrath vs Demonic Pact<br />
I said ToW vs. DP is a problem that we want to fix. We aren't ready to discuss potential fixes yet so there's not much I can add to that topic.<br />
<br />
We don't think Elemental (or Shadow for that matter) are as low as a lot of players of those respective specs seem to believe, but both received small buffs. While it wasn't necessarily our intention, both of those tweaks happen to be relatively tricky to theorycraft out, so the jury is still out on what kind of buff they will provide or if they will be considered &quot;enough.&quot;<br />
<br />
Some posters then tried to justify Demos's low dps because of their great buffs, but that isn't the way we actually want the game to work.<br />
<br />
All classes should have buffs. All damage specs should do competitive dps, with the exception that the four pure classes should do slightly higher dps. Different versions of the same buff should not feel wildly different with regard to talent expenditure, personal dps loss, up time, duration or scaling. We will continue to work to improve all of those issues. However, in almost all cases, individual skill, gear and group coordination will have a larger effect on your performance than anything we can do to buff your class.

Why does Ulduar have to be on the PTR? It's not new content, it doesn't need to be tested. You can get your numbers other places.</div></div><hr />

That is immortality. They got insanity, which means they did have some deaths (likely because of that same reason).<br />

There are a lot of guilds that have yet to kill him (even for a server first title), and some may have started to go practice on the PTR (4 copies of your main for the entire guild = 4 more hours of practice on 25 man per week).<br />
<br />

Obviously Ensidia has some very talented players, but you hit the nail on the head. The more time you have to play the game the more chances you have at killing a boss. There is absolutely no pressure involved with that type of play. BUT, having to go through content without having to wipe and eventually not having any player die is just insane. I'm sure Ensidia will get this achievement eventually, but I just personally feel there are better guilds out there than Ensidia. These type of achievements just prove it.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Ensidia is bad, they are better. Whos best. No you are dumb.....blabla fucking bla&quot;<br />
<br />
Premonition is one of 4 guilds who actually fight for world first. They deserve this achievement and its pretty nice to see now its us time. just gz.<br />
You think the other suck ? Why ? Because they need 1 more day ?<br />
Oh dear they must be really bad at all. 8 Guilds in the whole world cleared Colo heroic. Damn they suck.<br />
Are seriously reading what you wrote 5min ago ?<br />
<br />
Cant you just admit, that there are 4 good guild in the world.<br />
Ensidia, Premonition, Paragon and Stars.<br />
There´s nothing to add, they are just good actually.<br />
<br />
And to all you casual raiders in the world, do you really think this system is good ?<br />
(50 attemps, with the xxx disconnects by your raidmembers, because of the low performance of some servers ?)<br />
The achievment needs skill, but if you want to achieve it you need the same amount of luck and that sucks.<br />
What you want to see in the end a guild with skilled players and a huge amount of luck.<br />
Personally i dont care about those world first, because i dont fight for them. Its enough for myself, if i kill Algalon 1-2 monts later. But even for myself its annoying to see every fucking ID 2-3 constant disconnects of key-role-players. Does this have anything to do with skill ? And this system should be nice for all raiding guilds ?<br />
Well, yes it could be, if blizzard would be able to provide worldwide stable servers.<br />
Be lucky if you play at a good server.<br />
And then it become a class-stacking fight.<br />
Nice....&quot;Bring the players, not the classe&quot;<br />
Yes, every kill-screen is full of mages, rogues, dk´s. This is working as intended Blizzard, good job.<br />
The encounter is nice, but the way you need to kill him with ulduar-colo gear is just a bad joke.<br />
Wich normal raiding guild is able to have a raid with class stacking like this.<br />
Does this have anything to do with skill ?<br />
<br />
And after this, ppl beginn to say wich guild is best and wich is not ?<br />
<br />
Anyway, gz to Premonition and hopefully u´ll get the last achievment soon.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i mean its the ptr.... is it really that much of an advantage? enough people have already killed algalon in 25 man (3 guilds on my server)<br />
<br />
<br />
Is it so hard to read and understand?<br />
<br />
<br />
There are many servers that have not had a realm first kill on Algalon, and in order to prevent extra attempts per week we have Ulduar closed on the PTR.<br />
<br />
The sole purpose of the 1 hour lock is that you have only 1 hour of time to learn the encounter per week, going to the ptr for additional tries defeats the purpose of the 1 hour time limit.</div></div><hr />

edit: WFs really arent what they used to be. When a boss gets killed for the first time, the first zhing people look for are in which way the guild cheated to get it. Every WF is all about drama now. And the thing that really pisses me off is that there is alleays some retard who has to mention fakin Ensidia in topics that should be about congratulating the guild that did the deed, not hate the guild that didnt.<br />

The people that believes Ensidia exploit all their kills or thinks that they get help from GM's etc are most likely the same people that shouts conspiracy at global warming, the moon landing and 9/11. They are also waiting for the new world order to start ruling on earth.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Why do you think people are searching how they cheated ?<br />
<br />
Because in many cases they are also working on the encounter and know that there is some trick bypassing the obvious difficulty, meaning that they cheated or exploited, that's why it's almost always a drama.<br />
first yog 0 is exploit (staying in the brain)<br />
first anub is exploit (90-100% stunlock adds)<br />
first anub (bis) is exploit (mass soulstone)<br />
first 50 tries anub is (if same strategy as their previous kill) an exploit again (i'll add more details if you want, don't want to spoil the HM encounter version)<br />
<br />
Very simple reason, don't you think ?</div></div><hr />

I can't go into detail on all of them, but for starters Intimidation could be a lot better and Kill Command could be as fun as say Lock and Load instead of a macro'd ability.<br />
<br />
Well with what was done to remove BM hunters from arenas with killing BW, you better make intimidate into a kick ass ability, instead of a 1 minute cd 3 sec stunn that the pet has to do... <br />
And if Kill Command is changed to something like chance to proc of some shot or whatever, or dependant on anything, like lock and load is, then it may not be an ability you can keep active, like you can now with talents into it.<br />
<br />
In any way, BM hunter has no ofensive power or focused pressure other than the now destroyed bestial wrath, and horrible crowd controll, so in order to be even seen inside an arena, yes, intimidation needs to be much better for starts... But alooooot more than this needs to be done to make it a class/spec you would see in same numbers as other classes...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Achievements? No - optional just like on the XBox.<br />
Loots - Would be nice but it doesn't stop me experiencing the content.<br />
<br />
Content is what I pay for, that includes raids/bosses etc basically things I can see/experience for the story, lore or whatever - not something that makes my numbers a bit higher.<br />
<br />
For the &quot;Hardcore&quot; guilds who can do achievements such as this, well done to them but they are few and far between. Giving them a challenge is a good idea otherwise they'll lose interest but using valuable development time to create something only a tiny % of people will ever see (probably not many of the people posting here) isn't good for the game. As it is how, they still have bragging rights with the Mounts/Gear/Achievements etc but I don't feel short changed.</div></div><hr />

What is considered fair play to you? Stars has 300 members with two pro raiding groups going for world firsts and two raiding groups raiding for fun, rumors are they borrowed each others accounts to get extra tries. Paragon using over 15 soulstones on every other fight which has for soo long been considered cheesy and unfair, atleast as far as I knew.<br />
<br />
Now what about using the Holy Wrath gimmick that basicly removed the hard part of the adds in the fight which was used for the world first and the world second kill? I didn't see anyone whining about that? The problem with Anub'Arak is that Blizzard didn't notice gimmicks/bugs such as this one so ofcourse guilds will use it and I don't blame them...My biggest wish for future instances is that these wont exist at all(In a perfect world right?).<br />
<br />
Also the fact that the instance is released at different days in US/EU/Asia has also existed forever which from the start doesn't make things fair, I know it didn't make a big difference in this instance but for all previous ones US had an advantage over all and EU had an advantage over Asia.<br />
<br />
And for the last time, we took the opportunity to transfer away from Magtheridon because a FREE transfer was up and available...We regret not doing it before this instance even came out(Yes we were talking about it, THAT IS THE TRUTH SIR!)<br />

i mean its the ptr.... is it really that much of an advantage? enough people have already killed algalon in 25 man (3 guilds on my server)<br />
<br />
<br />
Maybe because people who haven't killed Algalon/other bosses yet can get used to the fights? You know Algalon can only be done 1hr/week - it would be an advantage to be able to have more time on him.<br />
<br />
What you mean by enough people killed Algalon already? just because other people already killed him that means there is no rights for me to see fights?<br />

Look at damage by actor and compare to what other guild have and what other guilds tries looks like.<br />

<br />
WOOOOW their tank is so good, only takes 1/10 of the damage of two tanks !<br />
<br />
Oh Wait... isn't this strange ? oO <br />
Let's look at the definition of exploit... <br />
<br />
Trivialize / Bypass an encounter difficulty by using an in game weakness, if i'm not wrong.<br />
it matches doesn't it ?<br />
<br />
Is using a specific combination of item on a certain class completely changing the balance of a fight, making it extremly easy instead of hard considered an exploit ? (-1 healer -1 tank +2 DD)<br />
Obviously Yes<br />
Any guild with an almost &quot;unhitable&quot; tank can do this.<br />
<br />
<br />
For me and for many this is not a legit way of doing this fight.</div></div><hr />

meh, I lag and died, then this week is done.<br />
<br />
More Algalon Please!<br />
<br />
<br />
You still get most of the reward loot wise for 45 attempts and up, now if ya &quot;lagged&quot; and died more than 5 times in a given week... =P<br />
<br />
For most guilds 50 attempts of hard + Ulduar hard modes + Normal TOC + Potential 10 man raids is more than enough to fill a raid schedule. I'm personally not a fan of the system because as many hardcore players have pointed out: It encourages for people to wait for CD's like Rebirth or Soulstones. TOC is however a short, &quot;test&quot; instance. So we will have to see what design blizzard goes for Icecrown. <br />

&quot;I have all the items the horseman drops (level 70 ones) I was wondering if the items themselves will be updated to 80 versions, or will I have to get a new 80 version through a drop?&quot;<br />
<br />
If a blue is responding to this question that is proof positive they've started making the game so easy. Why would anyone just assume magically that gear would change level?</div></div><hr />

While I do agree with you that nerd points have totally taken over actual progression and focus in the game to the point of making the game not fun, this achievement did drop bonus loot which makes it worth doing regardless of the EPEEN growth from a shiny screen graphic and digital points that mean nothing.<br />

Is using a specific combination of item on a certain class completely changing the balance of a fight, making it extremly easy instead of hard considered an exploit ? (-1 healer -1 tank +2 DD)<br />
Obviously Yes<br />
Any guild with an almost &quot;unhitable&quot; tank can do this.<br />

<br />
Block mechanics are assumed to be buggy on the fight in that the add multipliers on damage are applied AFTER Block, not before.<br />
Example:<br />
4k unblocked, x300% = 12k hit<br />
4k - 3k block, x300% = 3k hit<br />
<br />
Warriors are used because if they are unhittable, they'll Block just as often as Paladins but for more and take very little damage. Plus they have interrupts and AoE stun and can kite if need be pretty easily with their utility. Most everyone that couldn't use Holy Wrath is now using Defense Gem stacked Warriors for adds because of this. We'll see if Blizzard fixes it or not.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
So...re-gemming is an exploit now? <br />
<br />
I kind of get what you're saying there in that if the tank takes less damage, you see it fishy, though any upgrade in gear/stats causes you to take less damage, and blocking is an in game mechanic. <br />
<br />
I'm not here to argue what IS or IS NOT an exploit, I'm just saying that I think this particular claim ranks up there on the &quot;Reaching For It&quot; scale with the Judgement of Light stacking.... :-X.</div></div><hr />

Well fury doing 3.2k dps unbuffed and 7k buffed for me kind of shows that the buffs from the raid comp are the deciding factor on if I go fury or arms. Bring the player not the class, how bout bring the player not the buffs.</div></div><hr />

How can you tell the stats from a video?, and where is the video of this kill?<br />
if this is a exploit to use the gear provided in the game, how do you propose they fix this?<br />
<br />
premo is knoen to wear old gear and sch for a ss of a kill, they have been doing this forever. but i am looking at xav's armory and it looks to me like he has pure totC gear with the exception of a few ulduar drops...<br />
this trolling is silly<br />
<br />
they have killed this encounter before, doing it with 50 remaining just means they waiting on cooldowns for battle rez's. there is no new mechanic that they havent seen when there is more attempts up<br />

The Heroic Anub'arak Down news, you have 2 links.<br />
On the Warrior tank POV vid, he opens his character info panel at 1mn50, and you can see every defensive stat, and every items icons he wears.<br />
<br />
This is the video of their first kill, and you can see on the worldoflogs link of their last down that they use the exact same strat.<br />
<br />
To fix it before the block changes in Cataclysm, they just have to make the block apply AFTER the stacking debuff, or buff the burrower's default damage to at least 5-6k while nerfing the expose weakness debuff.</div></div><hr />

You know what'd be nice? If encounters were thoroughly tested enough so that EVERY TIME there's a world first there wasn't a huge outcry over &quot;X cheated this way&quot; and &quot;Y cheated that way&quot;. You know there's a problem when in successive weeks, MULTIPLE &quot;bugged&quot; mechanics are discovered to an endgame fight. I'm not usually too critical of Blizzard, but we've seen such a trend in intuitive, creative, &quot;unintended&quot; world firsts that there has to be a point where this is addressed.<br />
<br />
Blizzard: &quot;New Raid is out! Go kill it!&quot;<br />
Topguilds: &quot;donelol&quot;<br />
Blizzard: &quot;Ehhhhh we didn't mean for that to be able to happen, kill it again&quot;<br />
Topguilds: &quot;donelol&quot;<br />
Blizzard: &quot;Ehhhhh that was a mistake too, third time's the charm, right?&quot;<br />

Actually, Omen was and still is a raid level boss, meaning for an 80, he counts as 83.<br />
<br />
Ahune was a set level 72, which was kind of disappointing, except that he was both soloable, and I finally got his scythe this year for my collection.<br />
<br />
I'm curious what they'll do with Coren's loot table. It's possible they'll just take the loot he already had and buff it to 80. However since that loot was just a copy of Badge of Justice trinkets, it's possible he'll be given new loot that is a copy of present trinkets (likely Triumph, since we already have multiple versions of some of the Heroism trinkets like Mirror of Truth/Anvil of Titans/Banner of Victory). Or they could do something entirely different. I'll be happy if I can get a remote this year, though. Oh, and of course free Violet proto.</div></div><hr />

A paladin can get more block value than a warrior and can still keep a huge amount of stamina/avoidance thanks to redoubt and holy shield and your choice of librams that add like 500 more block value. Warriors do have shield block though.<br />
<br />
Regardless, this is easily a strategy that any other guild SHOULD have noticed if it is the case. Every high end guild (and even those that arent high end) are looking at logs, examining things and even in mid-combat should be examining the damage they take. On top of that I have never known a tank that didnt get a block value set just for kicks and giggles... I had an alt prot pally and even I was getting a lot of offset block gear just because you can do some massive farming/fun pvp with it. So, not having a block set is no excuse either.<br />
<br />
If it is unintended, then it will be fixed... but for now I see nothing really wrong with it. He loses like 13k health to do it and it works.</div></div><hr />

Seriously, it's like everyone has forgotten that some guilds would use a warrior OT stacking block value in BT to get through the first phase of Reliquary. Cause like, a warrior blocking 1000 damage on a mob that hits for like, 1000, is clearly a noob tank. And seriously, what warrior is not building a BV set for LOLSHIELDSLAM fun?</div></div><hr />

We lost plenty of good players either quitting the game or simply give up raiding because of all the yelling and pressure of these achievements and i can only assume that it will be the same when we have to attempt tribute to insanity in the near future.<br />

A guild can burn through 50 attempts in 10hrs of play time which sucks when the guild wants to raid 20hrs a week but doesnt have any content to raid because of the timer cockblocks.<br />
