It looks like Blizzard plans to make some parts of the upcoming patch 3.1 very soon. It probably means that we'll see it on PTRs in February, very soon? Only time will tell. <br />
We are going to be announcing some of our plans for classes in 3.1 fairly soon. The announcements will be prominent. They will not be comprehensive. We are not going to announce every change we are going to make. We are going to risk giving you some insight into a work in progress, even though we may ultimately decide not to make some of the changes. You guys can help me remind other players of that when they get angry because we didn't deliver a change that they were &quot;promised.&quot;<br />

Melee DPS Boost<br />
As far as melee dps goes, we think rogues, cats and Arms warriors are all a little low. We haven't announced specific changes yet but they are coming. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/14894639721-gc-any-teaser-on-feral-dps.html))<br />
<br />
SOTA - Faction Coin Toss<br />
In its original implementation, Strand of the Ancients had an internal coin toss that determined which faction would start on defense. Issues arose during the initial testing whenever Alliance started on defense, so we took out the coin toss temporarily. We understand that starting on defense every match can have its disadvantages, and we intend to implement the coin toss in an upcoming patch. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/14910061040-2-reasons-why-blizz-prefers-kids-faction.html))<br />
<br />
Low matchmaking rating<br />
It is likely that is due to your opposing team also having a low matchmaking (hidden) rating and a higher team rating, perhaps after a team reset.<br />
<br />
Imagine this, the players in both team A and B are 1200 rated players. The teams are then reset to 1500 team rating and both teams queue up against each other. The situation we then have is the following:<br />
<br />
Team A: 1200 matchmaking rating and 1500 team rating.<br />
Team B: 1200 matchmaking rating and 1500 team rating.<br />
<br />
Lets say that you face this same team 50 times in a row with a 50% win rate. The end result of this is that both teams will end up with around 1200 team rating. Why? Because this is the same situation as described in the previous post happening to both teams at once.<br />
<br />
In short, both teams are in reality 1200 rated teams due to matchmaking rating, and going 50/50 with an equally ranked team will ensure that both teams' team rating tries to match the respective matchmaking (hidden) ratings.<br />
<br />
[...] The biggest difference from before is that the new system &quot;remembers/knows&quot; what level of skill/rating you belong in and will push your team rating towards this level while matching you up against equally rated teams - even in a 50/50 win/loss situation. Recalling from previous seasons, a complaint we saw from players was that high rated players were resetting their rating and stomping lower rated or new players in the lower brackets on their way back up. This system aims to alleviate that problem and should match players more correctly against other teams around the same skill/rating level.

Bug - Ebon Plague not stackable<br />
This is the right solution. However, as I said the last time this question was asked, our priority right now is making sure more DKs spec Frost or Blood, not how to reward groups that bring multiple Unholy DKs. We do recognize it is annoying though and we'll get it fixed. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/14910130980-ebon-plague-fix-please-read-gc.html))<br />

Cunning/Ferocious Pet Tree and PvE/PvP disparities<br />
The Ferocious pets were intended predominantly for PvE use. We figured a pet with a stun would not be very popular in a raid encounter compared to a pet that just did more damage. (It is possible in a 5-player dungeon that the stun might come in handy).<br />
<br />
Since &quot;Ravage&quot; has traditionally been a stun, it made sense to put them in the Cunning tree.<br />
<br />
We are willing to make changes to make the Cunning tree more viable for PvP and other situations. Frankly, most of the community feedback on hunters has been on their shot damage or on which pet provides the highest dps boost in a raid setting. More feedback on hunter pet families and their talent trees would be useful. Too often, though, this discussions wander off topic into the role of the pet or the hunter in general.<br />
<br />
Ideally we'd like to see nearly every Ferocious pet and the occasional Cunning pet feel like they were valid choices for PvE and nearly every Cunning pet and the occasional Tenacity pet feel like they were valid choices in PvP. Our priority lately has been on the hunter trees themselves though. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/14697495943-cunning-pet-tree-and-ravager-effectiveness.html))<br />

Status Report on Mages (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/14697593270-request-for-a-status-report-on-mages.html))<br />
1) We like that Arcane is starting to feel like a viable alternative to FFB in PvE.<br />
2) We think Arcane has too much burst potential in PvP. We want to fix it without undoing the progress we've made on #1, or sending all Arena mages to Frost.<br />
3) We agree that the Scorch debuff is too much of a unique snowflake.<br />
4) This is definitely a concern, but lower priority than these other issues.<br />
5) Definitely a concern. We would love to get the &quot;Shatter combo&quot; vibe in PvE, but we haven't figured out a way to do it yet that doesn't involve buffing Cone of Cold, which would be bad for PvP reasons. <br />

Shamans survavibility in PvP<br />
Apologies in advance for the brief answers.<br />
<br />
On survivability, part of the problem is that some classes just do too much damage in PvP right now.<br />
<br />
But we are looking at Enhancement and Elemental shamans in PvP for 3.1. We hope to be able to announce more details soon.<br />
<br />
We don't want to inflate the bonuses for Mail, but it's possible health in general is low for Shamans. That has come up a couple of times. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/14910220928-gc-request-status-on-elemental-shamans.html))<br />

That's been &quot;trademarked&quot; in the IT industry since long before Blizzard was formed, but I still haven't come across any developers that use the term more than CCP Blue Frameworks. Blizzard's trademark is When It's Done™.</div></div><hr />

They were something like 90% sure of getting the dual spec in, but as per default couldn't promise it would be.<br />
We'll see what they came up with on the PTR at any rate.<br />

My own personal guess here, but I think GC's not going out of his way to type those blue posts about the nature of change announcements if the PTR's going to go ahead and reveal them right away. I speculate we'll get an announcement about some of these changes a week or so before the PTR goes up. Will be a nice forewarning so my guild can get ready for PTR Ulduar raiding if that's the case.</div></div><hr />

TBH, as survival my pet barely matters. I don't even use it to DPS most of the time. Why? Because keeping it next to me and full health for Roar of Sacrifice is more useful than anything it could do otherwise.<br />

Ferocious pets are the best for PVP as well for PVE. As a Surv hunter i didnt spec Imp revive, and love Heart of the Phoenix! I have yet to see an arena match where they killed my pet twice. Thats 2 talent points spend elsewhere :D. Also roar of recovery isnt usefull with the new viper, and +9% crit on Ferocious pets is a nice thing as well, especially for BM hunters PVP and PVE wise. They can fix Cunning, but as long as they dont mess up Ferocious!<br />
<br />
Also good to see they focus more on the hunter talent trees. Buff BM and MM a bit, but dont screw around with Surv plz! Oh ye and make deterrence a usefull ability</div></div><hr />

As every season, melee dps pwns anything. A rogue could take me down from a 100% to 0% in a matter of seconds being completly cc'ed, and i got around 800 resi. Also druid cats do insane dmg, and when u wanne hit them they go bear and become tanks rofl. <br />
Warrior dps isnt that good, but then again.. they wear plate so my DMG isnt good on them either. U cant be tuff and expect to do some hard burst dps as well! Thats the class u chose.<br />
<br />
If they change the dmg, i hope its for PVE only, and even nerf some of the PVP dmg, or make resi count for twice as much. At least that will stop the burst from pve geared players by a small amount, so pvp players can enjoy their arena for the time being instead of waiting for a fix in PVP and let us suffer.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oke, then heres the idea. Buff armor of the non plate classes also :D (except for druid bears).. but seriously, atm cloth wearers are tuffer then the mail wearers shamans and hunters. (absord, absord, lol, absorb, 3k! absord etc.) Ive got 9k armor as mail and 800 resi, but am still getting 9k crits on me. 2 different holy paladins have critted me for 5k :D.<br />
<br />
When a plate wearer with around 22k armor get hit with my 3.5k crits (pvp survival) on cloth and leather does around 1200 on plate. And plate wearers also have loads of stamina.. and now they need to do more dmg as well. Cant wait to see the 3.1 class changes tbh. Around 15k armor would help me survive a bit more in arena, and i wont have to feel like the hunter being hunted anymore.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We are willing to make changes to make the Cunning tree more viable for PvP and other situations. Frankly, most of the community feedback on hunters has been on their shot damage or on which pet provides the highest dps boost in a raid setting. More feedback on hunter pet families and their talent trees would be useful. Too often, though, this discussions wander off topic into the role of the pet or the hunter in general.<br />
<br />
<br />
It's pretty simple. With the new hunter FotM, SV is replacing BM in PVP. This means a pet that does most dammage is not nearly as good as an utility pet, like a bird of pray for example. <br />
What a smart hunter now looks for in a pet is it's ability, seeing that a bird of pray can dissarm for a short few seconds (snatch), or a hyena can apply cripple (tendon rip). Some may even go for a tenacity pet to use the &quot;30% dammage reduction&quot;, but without any usefull ability, this pet is just not as good.<br />
<br />
There are only a few pets, that have this kind of use in PVP, such being: <br />
- bird of pray (dissarm), <br />
- Hyena (Cripple),<br />
- Spider (web trap).<br />
<br />
The rest are just not as good. However, these skills are on a long CD with a verry short active time, except for hyenas. But it still leaves hunters with a verry few pets to choose, and we see clones in every BG (like not long ago CATS CATS CATS everywhere...)<br />
Bring skills to a few other pets, like a bear would maybe knock down a target (generates high amount of treath even if the target is not affected by the knockdown) so that it could make the bear a decent PVP pet while it still is verry good in PVE with this skill instead of the &quot;hit 3 tragets&quot;.<br />
<br />
But in the end it all comes to this: <br />
Best pet choice for a hunter in PVP now would be a pet that can do SOMETHING to the oponent... Dissarm, Cripple, Knockdown, etc... And not a ferocious pet that does a little more dmg... Atleast untill we see BM maybe become PVP spec again one day, if it ever hapens, and I hope not.</div></div><hr />

You are 100% right when u say that PVP pets its all about the special ability they have. However my main PVP pets as being Surv are Wasp and Hyena, both Ferocious pets.<br />
They both have nice (pvp) abilities, a small cd and the Ferocious talent tree.. which is overall better then the cunning tree. The extra dmg they have is just an bonus.<br />
The 9% more crit and heart of the phoenix is a really nice addition to a (BM) hunter.<br />
<br />
Look at these Ferocious pets for pvp. <br />
<br />
Hyena: Tendon Rip (Tears at an enemy's legs for [rank] and reducing movement speed by 50% for 6 sec) 20sec CD<br />
Wasp: Sting (Your wasp stings for [rank] Nature damage, and decreases the armor of the target by [rank] for 20 sec. While affected, the target cannot stealth or turn invisible) 6 sec CD<br />
Core hound &quot;Exotic&quot;: Lava Breath (Your pet breathes a double gout of molten lava at the target for [rank] Fire damage and reduces the target's casting speed by 50% for 10 sec) 10 sec CD.<br />
<br />
You also say Hyena has a nice pvp ability on a short cd, but forget to mention hes actually a Ferocious pet :).<br />
You also say Spider has a nice pvp ability (web) 4 sec movement impaired, but a silith also has a 4 sec web wich causes dmg as well, and ravagers do a stun. Bad thing about these pets is they have 40 sec cd, and in the bursty arenas 40 sec is a long time, and u wont see these abilities used more then 2 times.<br />
<br />
Only the Chimeara is awesome (except for the dash/lightning bug). I prefer my pets above anything else tbh.</div></div><hr />

I'm a BG-only player. This is partly down to class-spec. As it is, a player with resi is screwing me over and it's down to who can do more burst or who can time their CC's with their CD's, etc. If it was double, i'd be completely screwed.<br />
<br />
Anyway, gief 3.1.<br />
<br />
<br />
Where did u get the idea BG's are ment for PVE geared players? Reason for doing BG is to farm honor for PVP gear, and if u like doing BG's u can get PVP gear pretty easy. And if you hate arena, theres even a thing called WG and VOA, HC and Raids to get 3/5 deadly and full hatefull (T7) without putting the effort of competition. BG is PVP after all, dont you agree?<br />
<br />
It seems more like you dont want to wear PVP gear, cause it lowers down your burst, but improves your survivability. To bad thats not Blizzards vision about how PVP is ment to be played. They dont want PVE players bursting down PVP geared players, and thats why they are trying to fix is (hopefully in patch 3.1). Also, with the new duel spec u can spec for arena if you want to get the better pvp gear.<br />
<br />
And btw, it would be just terrible if you have time your CC's with your CD's etc vs PVP geared players... welcome to PVP my furry friend ;)</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tripp</div><div class="date">2009-02-04, 04:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Can someone explain to me about the mage pvp thing about making mages go frost for pvp? im confused<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Arcane Mages are known for their burst damage. They don't have the defensive tools a Frost Mage has (Frost also has sick burst w/ Shatter combos). If you take away Arcane's burst damage then most Mages would just spec Frost to get burst damage and survivability again.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MuTe</div><div class="date">2009-02-04, 04:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">First off, don't be so condescending. I've got almost 54000 HK's, so i'm not new to PvP.<br />
Also, where did i ever say BG's WERE for PvE geared players? I was merely stating that resi. is fine as it is (except it needs to actually work). It doesn't need buffing at all, it just needs fixing.<br />
<br />
And why does EVERYONE seem to think that everyone else is JUST there for the honor and therefore the gear? I PvP because i enjoy the challenge. It differs from PvE, in that it's not a static environment. There is no &quot;Don't stand in the fire&quot; here, but there is &quot;That's one f'ck off fireball heading your way&quot;. I don't PvP for the gear. The reason i don't arena? I despise the fact i'm limited in what CD's i can use. I do WG and really enjoy it. I do VoA, but that's PvE, not PvP.<br />
<br />
So you see, there ARE people out there that give a shit about the gear, but do care about PvP being balanced for everyone regardless of stats like resi.<br />
<br />
<br />
PVE and PVP are 2 different things, and im sure you agree. There are 2 different gears with different stats for that specific reason. You wont spec &quot;resto&quot; and expect to make Hks. Same reason u would be wanting to wear PVP gear to be a good component, and PVE gear to do well in raids.<br />
<br />
Problem has been for a long time that Rogues do arena in PVE gear, have insane dmg, cc and survival skills. Blizzard does not want this anymore (and neither do i for that matter).<br />
You state, u play BG for fun. Im a full time PVP/Arena/BG player but also do 25 man raids for fun, and spend my dkp's to get the gear that drops to improve myself PVE wise. It should only be logic for you to get the PVP items when u enjoy the BG's and enjoy it more when u become a better opponent. I dont expect to out dps a full T7 geared player during raids with my PVP epics. The &quot;fun&quot; also goes away after my teamm8 and i have gotten to 1800+ rating, spend hours and hours getting a full hatefull/deadly gearset, and get owned by a full T7+ geared player that just happends to enjoy a BG in his raid gear.<br />
<br />
You cant expect Blizzard to balance the game where both pvp and pve gear are valid for BG's or any other form of PVP. It never has been the otherway around either.<br />
Resi has nothing to do with PVE, so doesnt hurt PVE in any form. Why should PVE players be able to do PVP and PVE with the same gear, while PVP players dont have that luxery?<br />
<br />
Besides all this. PVP is a competition, pvp gear is a reward, and should help you improve.. it currently does not. I say buff resi now for the moment, and fix it then (cause its obviously hard to fix). At least PVP players will feel their gear actually matters.</div></div><hr />

I'm an arms warrior and am usually the lowest (or near there) on the DPS charts. I have 7 level 80 epics, and today was out-dpsed by a freshly dinged level 80 (fury) with all greens. I know how to play my class, it's just that fury DPS is much better (at the moment) than arms, especially since the execute nerf.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Keep in mind that every boss will have a hard mode like Sarth3D, so it'll take a lot of learning, and we're really looking forward to the challenge (and to ensure server firsts of course).<br />
<br />
One other note is that Blizzard said the instance will only be available one or two bosses at a time and then it'll be shutdown for testing completely. It's unlikely we'll get to see much time to perfect the hard modes. With or without PTR testing, I think the easy modes of the bosses will be clearable within a couple weeks.<br />
<br />
Only thing that bothers me is I have a feeling the instances are going to be too laggy to be playable. I play on a high-pop server where 25 Man lag can be sometimes unbearable during peak times. The recent optimizations seemed to have worked, but I'd imagine they'd need to instate a heavy queue to prevent it from being overloaded. When you think about it, this could be the one issue holding them back from releasing 3.1 right now instead of in a couple weeks.<br />
<br />
The two main goals of the 3.1 PTR will be to test the major class changes and the Ulduar instance itself. We plan to support Blizzard in this fashion.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard has stated again and again that rogues are intended to be the kings of sheer DPS, since they don't particularly have any other PVE utility. That's not the case right now. Sure, a good rogue can hit 4-5k DPS. But a death knight can still beat that.<br />
<br />
<br />
Bug - Ebon Plague not stackable<br />
This is the right solution. However, as I said the last time this question was asked, our priority right now is making sure more DKs spec Frost or Blood, not how to reward groups that bring multiple Unholy DKs. We do recognize it is annoying though and we'll get it fixed. (Source)<br />
<br />
Hahahahaha it took them 3 months to realize a major bug, and they're hardly apologetic at all. As a raiding Unholy tank, this is the reason we've refused to bring any other UH DKs to any raids.</div></div><hr />

As a Surv hunter i didnt spec Imp revive, and love Heart of the Phoenix! I have yet to see an arena match where they killed my pet twice. Thats 2 talent points spend elsewhere :D. Also roar of recovery isnt usefull with the new viper, and +9% crit on Ferocious pets is a nice thing as well, especially for BM hunters PVP and PVE wise. They can fix Cunning, but as long as they dont mess up Ferocious!<br />
<br />
Also good to see they focus more on the hunter talent trees. Buff BM and MM a bit, but dont screw around with Surv plz! Oh ye and make deterrence a usefull ability<br />
<br />
<br />
Roar of Sacrifice, not Roar of Recovery. (Might want to look it up, since I was talking about TENACITY pets, and it's about 50x better than RoR.)<br />

<br />
They're talking about PVE, moron.<br />

<br />
<br />
Some may even go for a tenacity pet to use the &quot;30% dammage reduction&quot;, but without any usefull ability, this pet is just not as good.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
If you think 30% less damage with a 50% uptime is &quot;not as good&quot; as a 2 second stun on a 40 second cooldown, you're retarded.<br />

You are not too bright are you? The areas where damage is low in these classes is PvE. Player Versus Environment. Not Player Versus Player. They are two separate things. <br />

This means that you won't need to buy lots of stacks of bullets, just one bullet to let the game know what bullet are you using. <br />
