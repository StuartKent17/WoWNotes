You can see the current stats on the Season 12 Armor sets page (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/536-Season-12-Armor-Sets) and on WoWDB (http://www.wowdb.com/items?filter-reqlvl-min=90&amp;filter-pvp-only=y&amp;filter-slot=2358020)for the off set items.<br />
We’re working to adjust current Justice and Honor gear to better align with intended values. Currently it’s more lucrative to run Battelgrounds for ilvl 464 epics, and convert all Justice to Honor to gear up. While some crossover is fine, the most optimal way to gear for PvE doesn’t make sense to happen through PvP.<br />
<br />
This hotfix will ideally go out today, and once applied will change all Justice and Honor items (including those already purchased) in the following ways:<br />
<br />
Justice Items<br />
Current – ilvl 450 Rare<br />
New – ilvl 458 Rare<br />
<br />
Honor Items<br />
Current – ilvl 464 Epic<br />
New – ilvl 458 Rare<br />
<br />
We’ll be increasing the PvP Power and Resilience on the Honor items by 15% to compensate for this change.<br />
<br />
Again, our design in Mists of Pandaria is to allow for a greater degree of crossover between PvE and PvP using the same gear, but the original item levels simply made Honor gear (through Battlegrounds or conversion of Justice to Honor) a far better route to gear up for PvE. Players who enjoy PvE shouldn’t feel forced to PvP to get the best gear, and vice versa.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Conquest gear is obviously the only worthwhile gear to grind out now for item levels, and that's probably the best way to incentivise Arena: make PvEers do it. Lol.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Now they give 458? You're going to be replacing them quickly in the heroics anyhow :P They should just be used as filler for what quest rewards you didn't get in Dread Wastes to hit 440.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, I cashed in my JP this morning and bought honor gear, not a huge deal as I get a good 2 set bonus, but somewhat annoying. I agree with the change as I thought everything about JP gear was messed up from having to have rep to being that much worse than honor gear. The big question is 'how did this go live'. When MoP launched and I looked into JP gear and honor gear, the first thing I thought is how broken the acquisition system was and how ridiculous it was that Honor gear was that much better than JP gear. How could they not have seen these issues, and even if they missed them, someone in beta must have pointed it out. Fixing retroactively just pisses people off, so why on earth did they not fix this before launch.</div></div><hr />

Err, the primary source of JPs is heroics. So, no. <br />
<br />
The JP items are 450 (and now 458) because they assume players have 4000JP banked up from Cataclysm.<br />
<br />
This is really bizarre, because you're killing bosses that drop 463 gear to get points you can spend for inferior gear. At least 458 is half a tier closer.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The NEW point is to ease the transition, the point in the previous expansions was to cover the slots you were not having lucky to drop in heroics, which is why they had the same ilvl.<br />
<br />
You ran heroics, get JP and some gear. For that elusive gear that just dont drop and when it does it gets ninjaed, you had JP.<br />
<br />
I prefer the old point to the new one.</div></div><hr />

I think they should've left ilvl 450 JP gear alone and buff heroic dungeon gear to 464. Then people who enjoy to PvE will farm dungeons and people who enjoy PvP will farm BGs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Unless i'm mistaken, you only get Justice Points from running Heroics? So they really don't have much purpose if you're already geared for Heroics (which is basically the second you hit 90).<br />
<br />
Perhaps its just a oddity for the launch as i'm sure once the next raiding tier comes out, the valor point gear will transition to justice points. The real question then will be, will they remove the reputation requirement for that gear?</div></div><hr />

It's not an option though, because it's inferior to boss drops. You want to replace the justice point gear right away; it has no lasting value. The situation is completely bizarre. <br />
<br />
Not as bizarre as before this change, though, when everybody was trading in justice points for honor to buy PvP gear to PvE. That was CRAZY.</div></div><hr />

Thank you, someone understands the point they're triyng to do with the new system, and it's nice because it helps you in getting gear, and it isn't the way you gear.<br />
<br />
Err, the primary source of JPs is heroics. So, no. <br />
<br />

If you still have a 432, or even a 414 somewhere on you, I'd like to easily replace those so I don't have to be as rocky going in. It's ment to fill in slots from quests due to bad luck, not be a whole way to gear. Also you could rack up JP from the normal LFG que.<br />
<br />
458 items still doesn't really help considering heroics give 463.<br />
It's definatly helpful if they replace a 416 or 432 you couldn't find. Plus the requirement for heroics is 440, so it's not like a hard thing to get where yo uneed the gear. :V</div></div><hr />

<br />
haha, indeed.. i just wasted a day grinding honor, when now it looks like i shouldve kept grinding heroics...<br />
<br />
<br />
theres still alota slots that you cant buy an item for with justice.. for rogues theres no head, shoulder, waist, feet, wrist, trinkets or weapons that can be bought with justice.. you can buy a full set with honor, and its a heck of a lot faster to get honor</div></div><hr />

And really, this was going to happen sooner or later -- else people are going to be crammed into LFR full of PvP gear. <br />

Might want to some fact checking there. The primary source of JP is killing Normal Mode dungeons while leveling to 90. My toon is only 87 and its already capped out. having 4k at 90 wont be hard, im sure even new monks can do it. And replacing that odd 400-415 piece with a 458 is a big jump.</div></div><hr />

You are kidding with farming heroics, right? They aren´t that easy, even in guild groups you aren´t farming them. But most players are still running them in PUGs, which certainly are not on farm mode yet.<br />

Really, I agree though, I have no idea what they were thinking having honor gear be epics. Was just too easy to get sha crystals that way. They always should have been equal ilvl and both blue.</div></div><hr />

I'm so weird, I spend my JP on slots I haven't been able to get a 463 in.<br />

Oh yeah, and how about PvE trinkets and some stupid last boss pve weapons being better than any PvP gear you can get?<br />

Just because the pvp community has been fucked for 3 expansions, it doesn't mean that the pve community should now be fucked!<br />
This change was totally called fore. The bad thing isn't that they change it, but the fact that they didn't put it like this from the get go.<br />
<br />
On a side note. PvP is an ADDITION to the main game, which still is a role playing game, not the other way around! So if any part if to suffer to &quot;fix&quot; the other part, it has to be the PvP part.</div></div><hr />

2 solutions: <br />
<br />
1) Combine pve and pvp gear, get rid of powers and shit and sit down + balance *would hurt both pve/pvp<br />
2) Get rid of secondary stats in pvp gear, go extreme with powers and resilience.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What blizz did was totaly right. I have to admit i don't pvp that much = more of a pve freak, but still....<br />
- JP gear to 458, good. Now we can use them to fill gaps in gear where we are unlucky in HCs (like others have mentioned)<br />
- We get JP from normal instances + a lot of people got caped honor + JP from cata.<br />
- Unless they changed it back, HC requirement is now ilvl 435 instead of 440 (Not a needed change imo, but now people can't QQ about having to &quot;farm&quot; gear to 440)<br />
- PvP gear got BUFFED in power/resi to make up for the reduction to 458, so it will still be great for pvp... It's just not as good for pve, which is why they changed it to beginn with. <br />
<br />
So what they basicly did was to make it easier for both parts, without mixing them together (pve gear for pvp and other way around)... I honestly don't understand how you guys can whine so much about it and how you can't see how it helped both parts in a way.<br />
And yes, I kinda agree that it's stupid that blizz didn't add honor weaps. But weapons are dropping from almost every HC instance, and you will do normals/HCs or something similar sometime anyway i gues? I mean, i don't know a single pvp player that NEVER does pve just for some variasion in his playing.<br />
<br />
Ohh, and i didn't even get pvp gear from honor yet (partly because I honestly didn't know about it haha) but i will now, even if it's &quot;nerfed&quot;.... altho i'm getting it to pvp every now and then. <br />
So i think blizz did the right thing here, keep it up!! :)<br />

Ya, I don't know why they didn't just make the JP gear and 5man heroic gear 464 like the honor shit. Conquest Point gear will prob be the same way, better then LFR gear and thus players will farm it out to start raids(more of a casual player). Kinda what I plan to do. Get conquest gear chillax.</div></div><hr />

I opened a ticket, we'll see what happens. I also read reports from other players that entering instances caused JP gear to re-activate faction requirement. If this takes another maintenance day to fix, then I wont be needing any 463 by then. This change does help people who want to alt up a little bit but still this expansion feels more like a one character for the first half kind of expansion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is no side that has to suffer for anything. All they would have to do is add more pvp power to the weapons to make them desirable in PvP but not worth it in PvE. The fact that they are simply refusing to do so and rather give us a big fuck you while never changing anything for our sake even if it wouldn't matter much, just make PvE players do a little less damage (BOO FUCKING HOO) or not even, but just make certain things simply not usable or not work in the arena.<br />
<br />
But no. <br />
For PvE? In a Heartbeat. <br />
For PvP? Not in a million years.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Perhaps they're going with a new gearing system than previous expansions; maybe now JP gear is supposed to help get you into Heroics, seeing as normal dungeons give JP.<br />
<br />
But then again, with how absurdly easy Heroics are, JP gear isn't even necessary...you can just hop into heroics in quest greens and some normal mode blues and still do fine. GG blizz.</div></div><hr />
