<br />
Because most of the pageviews will be generated after the raid will have opened.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, there seems to be little to no set up for Alliance to be in there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, there is next to zero build-up for Alliance. The closest we get is Brann Bronzebeard making mention of Uldir at the beginning and end of the Underrot dungeon (which also has no build-up for Alliance). That's the problem with separating factions out with almost independent stories but still having us do the same content in the end. Why does the Horde go to the Siege of Boralus? It would make sense if they were capitalizing on the chaos and trying to take over the city, but as far as I know they just kill the same invading force that Alliance does. Nonsensical.</div></div><hr />

This is the first I have heard of this. Is there actually an encrypted cinematic in the game data for one of these? We never had one for Highmaul or Emerald Nightmare.</div></div><hr />

dw they have traits, they just don't show up on that link style</div></div><hr />

<br />
They are Azerite pieces, obviosuly, but since they aren't class specific, they can't know which traits will be available to you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Does this raid have anything to do with the Loa of the Kings? There could be a cinematic that progresses this, possibly showing Vol'Jin take the mantle and giving prelates back their power.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Story wise the Horde don't do Siege of Boralus, and the Alliance probably has nothing to do with Uldir, but for gameplay reasons obviously this stuff needs to be opened up to both factions.</div></div><hr />

yeah, i think it was cleared and no cinematic showed up, so they removed that part here.</div></div><hr />
