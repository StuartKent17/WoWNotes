Hey, how about that landslide of Mists of Pandaria information? It has taken a few days, and will probably take a few more, for the nuance of everything to really sink in. One of the topics we've been getting lots of questions about is the crazy new loot model we're introducing in Mists. We've answered several related questions in the forums, but thought it might be prudent to just put all the information in one place.<br />
<br />
I should clarify that the systems we're introducing are actually pretty simple in practice. I'm only going into a fair amount of detail because those are the kinds of questions we are getting. You don't have to understand all the particulars to participate, and we're certain that it will just all make sense once you are experiencing it in-game instead of hearing it described (that whole &quot;show, don't tell&quot; thing). Let's begin:<br />
<br />
Personal Loot<br />
<br />
Here is how looting works in today's Raid Finder groups:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The boss dies.<br />
The game randomly decides which items off of the boss's loot table drop.<br />
The group rolls Need, Greed, or Pass on each item.<br />
If you were raiding with a group of friends, you might discuss who should get each item. Even if you ultimately lost, hopefully you are happy that a friend got an upgrade and that your group as a whole is now a little bit stronger.<br />
But if you're in Raid Finder, you are quite possibly alone with a bunch of strangers.<br />
So, if you can Need, you probably do, because there's no time for discussion, some of the rollers may be AFK, and even if you piss someone off, you aren't likely to have to pay the social cost of doing so since you'll never see them again.<br />
The highest roll wins.<br />
Drama ensues.<br />
<br />
<br />
Here's how the new Raid Finder system will work in Mists of Pandaria:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The boss dies.<br />
The game automatically decides who won some loot, and gives those players a spec-appropriate item.<br />
Some players may still get mad, but hopefully they are mad at the laws of probability and not at the rest of the raid.<br />
<br />
<br />
So, realistically, that's really all you need to know to understand how it'll play out in-game. For those looking for more detail, here's what's happening behind the scenes:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The boss dies.<br />
Each player has a chance to win loot, independent of the other players.<br />
For each player who wins loot, the game randomly assigns them a spec-appropriate item from that boss's loot table. This subset contains only items that the game (meaning the designers in this case) thinks are appropriate for your class and current spec.<br />
Notice that you aren't rolling Need or Greed. You don't have an option to Pass. The game just says &quot;Take this.&quot;<br />
You can't trade this item, or that would defeat the purpose of removing the social pressure on groups of strangers. If you don't want the item, you are free to vendor, delete, or disenchant it.<br />
<br />
<br />
The big difference here is that instead of kill -&gt; loot -&gt; roll, the new system uses kill -&gt; roll -&gt; loot. The loot is not determined until the winners are determined. It's all automatic, and you're under no obligation to pass or roll â€” these choices no longer exist. The game decides who gets loot, not the players. The end. Nobody is going to be a callous jerk and take the item that you rightfully deserve. Nobody is going to try to talk you into trading an item to them because they are down on their luck and can't ever win a weapon. No DPS dude is going to ninja the tanking shield that you need for your guild to progress.<br />
<br />
We understand some players are interested in off-spec or transmogrification loot, and we will consider future changes to the system to accommodate those desires. However, we're not sure fundamentally that Raid Finder is the best avenue for acquiring that loot. You would either need to take it from another player who actually desires it for their main spec, or a conversation would have to take place to make sure nobody else needed it more than you do. In other words, you would have to stop people from just rolling Need whenever they could. I've seen some suggestions that we allow an option for essentially &quot;I'm happy to get loot beyond just what my main spec can use,&quot; and maybe that's the kind of approach we could take, but let's make sure the basic design works first. For now, there are other avenues, such as dungeons, faction gear, normal raids or older content to provide off-spec or cosmetic gear.<br />
<br />
Here is a model I've seen some people say they want:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The boss dies.<br />
I get the exact item or items I want.<br />
I never have to come back and kill this boss again.<br />
I politely ask Blizzard when there will be new content for me to run.<br />
<br />
<br />
I added that, somewhat tongue in cheek, to point out that the intent of the new system is not to make killing bosses or getting loot more efficient, or to let you choose buffet-style which items you get. We like random loot being random, as long as it isn't so frustratingly random that you stop enjoying the experience. The intent of the new loot system is really to relieve social pressure on a group of random and anonymous strangers. We think it is reasonable for groups of friends, such as the typical raiding guild, to have a discussion about how to divvy up loot. That discussion is a tried and true RPG tradition going back to D&amp;D or earlier. We don't think that is a reasonable expectation for Raid Finder, though.<br />
<br />
The personal loot system will initially be used for Raid Finder and for world bosses. We want to use it for world bosses because we want it to be fairly easy to form PUGs to take down these bosses when they're up. If my raiding guild is about to take on a world boss, and some lonely hunter is asking to join the group (it's always a lonely hunter, isn't it?), it would be nice to be able to bring him on without worrying about that jerk taking loot away from me or my friends. We want to foster a &quot;the more the merrier&quot; attitude with world bosses.<br />
<br />
This is why it's so important to us that the size of the group shouldn't matter. We don't want guilds to try to kill a world boss with the smallest number of players necessary in order to maximize loot per player. When everyone has their own chance at loot, why not make the group as large as you can? Note that you still have to be a member of the group that taps and kills the boss. We want to have a little bit of competition for world boss kills, especially between the Horde and the Alliance. We think that is part of the fun of world bosses; otherwise, why not just stick the gronn in a cave? (That sounds dirtier than I intended.) We don't want everyone in the zone to get credit just by lurking around. We want you to cooperate with other players, and we're trying to remove barriers to cooperation by eliminating loot drama.<br />
<br />
Bonus Roll<br />
<br />
We have one other new system that will use part of the personal loot model. This is what we're calling the bonus roll.<br />
<br />
Once upon a time, raiders had to invest a lot of time and effort every week preparing for a raid. This felt kind of cool in the abstract because it built anticipation, rewarded players who prepared for raid night, and otherwise just added a little more ceremony to the act of entering the dragon's lair to seek glory and treasure. The reality is that you spent your time killing mobs to farm flask materials or gathering Whipper Root Tubers. The reality didn't match the fantasy and we eventually greatly minimized the need to farm consumables altogether. Of course, that led to another problem, as raiders would log on for raid nights, finish, and then have nothing to do the rest of the week. The bonus roll is intended to give those players something to do that is hopefully more enjoyable than grinding elementals or Blasted Lands boars. We want to see players out in the world doing stuff, and we want that stuff to be a little more interesting (if not downright fun) than farming mats.<br />
<br />
The way it works is like this: We have two major Pandaren factions, the Elders and the Craftsmen. Completing daily quests and scenarios for each group earns you one of two currencies. The Craftsmen tokens are spent mostly on cosmetic items. The Elder tokens are spent mostly on power items. The intent here is to let players who want some optional content to be able to devote time to both Craftsmen and Elders, while more min-max focused players or players who don't want such a time commitment can stick to Elders. The Elder tokens can be used to purchase head enchants, some nice purple items, and the kind of gear you've come to expect from factions. However, they also sell an item called a Charm of Good Fortune. Imagine you can complete a quest once a week to buy one Charm for 25 Elder Tokens. You also might be able to save up a few charms, but you won't be able to hoard them until the next tier of content.<br />
<br />
If you have one or more Charms of Good Fortune, then whenever you kill a raid boss (in Raid Finder, normal or heroic) then a new UI window will pop up asking if you want to spend your Charm on a bonus roll. If you click yes, then you'll instantly get another shot at that boss's loot table! You will always win something from the bonus roll, such as a pile of gold, gems, or flasks. However, you also have a small (but not miniscule) chance of receiving a piece of epic loot. As with the personal loot system, the item will always be something designed for your current spec. Also, just as with personal loot, the game doesn't analyze if you already have the item, if the item would be an upgrade for you, or if you prefer axes to swords or anything like that.<br />
<br />
Most importantly, winning a bonus roll has no effect on what other players win on their bonus rolls or what the boss drops normally. If you have saved up several Charms (this will probably happen when you play but don't raid every week) then you can use one per boss, but you can't cash in multiples on a single boss kill. If you want to save up all of your Charms for the final boss because he (or she in the case of the mantid raid) drops weapons or whatever, that is your prerogative, but you'll only be able to spend one per kill. If you want to save up your Charms for heroic bosses, go for it.<br />
<br />
Here is an example of per-person loot and the bonus roll in action:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Stan is a death knight.<br />
Jim Bob is a warrior.<br />
Naomi is a hunter.<br />
The three friends run Raid Finder together and tackle Mogu'shan Vaults. They get matched with a bunch of random folks from across their region. On the fourth boss, the Council of Kings, the game decides that Jim Bob wins an item. Jim Bob is a Fury warrior, so the game is either going to give him a two-handed Strength axe or a Strength bracer, because those are the two Fury-appropriate items on the Council of Kings loot table (in this theoretical example). Regardless of what Jim Bob wins, Stan might also win the same items. Naomi won't ever be offered those items, because they aren't appropriate hunter loot. If she had gotten lucky and earned loot for the kill, it would have been hunter appropriate.<br />
Let's say Naomi is frustrated because Bob and Stan both won loot and because the trinket she wants won't ever drop. So, she decides to use a Charm of Good Fortune. Let's say she gets lucky and the game decides that she won an item instead of gold, flasks, etc. (Thanks, game!) She might get the trinket she wants, or she might get an Agility neckpiece that is also on the Council of Kings loot table. Her winning an item doesn't affect Stan or Jim Bob or anyone else, even if they use their Charms as well.<br />
<br />
<br />
Okay, we're almost done here, but I did want to mention two other relevant changes.<br />
<br />
Area of Effect Looting<br />
<br />
Yes, we are doing area looting. After killing a group of enemies, you may have a bunch of corpses lying around (perhaps because you went all Bladestorm on a bunch of hozen). If you loot one of the corpses, the loot window will include items from all of the nearby corpses for which you have loot rights. Some recent games have incorporated a similar feature, and it's one of those things that players just want in their MMO these days. It's already in and it works fine.<br />
<br />
The Future of Valor<br />
<br />
The second change I want to mention is that we plan to adjust the role of Valor points. Valor (or the various other names that the currency has had over the years) was originally added to WoW for two reasons: it helped to mitigate really bad luck, for those times when the boss just refused to drop the item you wanted, and it helped encourage players to stay with the group even if they didn't need anything off the next boss.<br />
<br />
Over time, we have felt like Valor has taken on too prominent a role, to the point that it risks becoming more important than actual boss loot. This is particularly the case when the tier sets are available on the Valor vendors. We think killing dragons and ransacking their hoard is more epic than shopping at the magic armor store, so we want to shift back toward boss kills being the primary source of epic PvE gear.<br />
<br />
In Mists of Pandaria, Valor will be used to power a new feature that allows you to increase the item level of your existing epic items. This means that each week, you can become a little more powerful, hopefully allowing you to kill that boss that has eluded you thus far. There will be a bit of a game in trying to decide when to upgrade your gear versus hoping for a new piece to drop from a raid boss, but our plan is that even heroic gear can be upgraded slightly in this way.<br />
<br />
We won't allow you to upgrade Raid Finder gear so much that it becomes better than normal gear, but imagine if you can increase your item level by around eight points. At this time, we're thinking there won't be gear on the Valor vendors at all, but we'll see how that shakes out. Valor will come primarily from dungeons (including challenge modes) and scenarios. You might earn a little from daily quests and raiding as well, but that won't be as efficient.<br />
<br />
Final Thoughts<br />
<br />
That's a lot of information to absorb all at once I know, and I'm sure it will lead to dozens of questions. It'd be more helpful to us if you were to focus your discussion on how things will feel, and the basic rules of the system, instead of immediately leaping to the conclusion that you've figured out some exploit and ergo the whole thing is doomed to failure. We've stitched up a lot of the egregious loopholes already and the system is a little more complicated behind the scenes than I figured was worth getting into here.<br />
<br />
Check it out in beta if you get the chance. Let us know how it feels. We have time to iterate and refine this stuff. Good luck on getting the loot you want, too... but not too quickly.<br />

Click on the boss to loot like any other mob. The end result is the same, but make it feel like you're looting. This will be a harder thing to communicate considering the history of raid looting, but I think worth it.</div></div><hr />

I also LOVE how all tier comes from boss tokens in DS and really hope they keep to that model. What I hate about the current system (and its been getting worse with each tier to be honest although the change to the way tier gear works in T13 was a step in the right direction) is that it makes you feel, as a raider, that you need to keep farming heroics constantly to get raiding gear. That was a boring grind and it also devalued raid gear - Raid gear is meant to be special. It is meant to be gear that you earn from killing a boss with a group of other people. It was utterly ridiculous that you could obtain gear equal in power to normal mode raid gear just by farming laughably easy 5 mans over and over again then going to a shop in the middle of Orgrimmar.So yeah, thumbs up for these changes from me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Correct - if you win a loot roll (and by win I mean imagine the entire raid is rolling 1d20 - anyone who gets 18, 19, or 20 gets a loot drop for instance), it will automatically pick a piece of loot off the table for your spec randomly. If a boss has three things you can use, it rolls 1d3 and you get that piece, regardless if you have it or a better piece all ready.</div></div><hr />

Billy's roll determines &quot;Loot or No Loot&quot; If it comes up &quot;Loot&quot;, Billy gets an appropriate item from that boss. As a Hunter, it might be the bow again, or if that boss also has a ring, he could get the ring. It is on a boss-by-boss basis too. Plus, he can use one of those Charms of Good Fortune once per loot attempt on that boss, to get a re-roll (so, once a week, per boss), if he doesn't get an item.</div></div><hr />

Yep ok, but that's actually a bad thing imo. Would make more sense if when you already have all the items your spec needs, you can't win the roll. <br />
Or ou can win, but then the 4th roll gets loot too (assuming 3 loots / boss). I wouldn't like to &quot;ninja&quot; someone chance to loot by getting an useless item.</div></div><hr />

Ghostcrawlers point about World bosses is valid. You don't want to just bring your 10 man guild team; you want to bring as many people as possible (so 40 presumably).</div></div><hr />

I also LOVE how all tier comes from boss tokens in DS and really hope they keep to that model. What I hate about the current system (and its been getting worse with each tier to be honest although the change to the way tier gear works in T13 was a step in the right direction) is that it makes you feel, as a raider, that you need to keep farming heroics constantly to get raiding gear. That was a boring grind and it also devalued raid gear - Raid gear is meant to be special. It is meant to be gear that you earn from killing a boss with a group of other people. It was utterly ridiculous that you could obtain gear equal in power to normal mode raid gear just by farming laughably easy 5 mans over and over again then going to a shop in the middle of Orgrimmar.So yeah, thumbs up for these changes from me.<br />
<br />
So now we are getting a vp system where if you have utterly horrid luck, you won't get anything ever. Sounds great<br />
<br />
Know what the better solution would have been? Just taking vp off from running 5 mans. The thought of having every upgradeable item drop off boss's running 10 mans is both disgusting and insulting. Even more so for future mop raids where god knows we get more 7 and 8 boss raids : / Have fun gearing a 10 man in any reasonable amount of time<br />
<br />
Current VP system would be more then fine if running 5 mans wasn't handing out VP, and only raids did.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's the point of world bosses, also that would pretty much kill the world pvp aspect.<br />
It would be handled the same way it has always been handled fight to the death over the boss, pretty simple solution.<br />
If you don't want to fight well you don't get loots.<br />
<br />
In a pve situation you tag it first, its pretty much the same thing.<br />
<br />
Edit: Ok maybe kill world pvp is a little harsh, i can still see world pvp happening regardless of this system. Here's to thinking to much into things, something i tell people not to do lol.<br />
Its probably a good idea as mostly random people will probably do these bosses not guild groups for the most part atleast<br />

<br />
well that's the strength: you're not rolling against other players. You're just rolling to meet an arbitrary goal.<br />
<br />
You and your friend are in LFR and beat a boss. He has several pieces he can win, you've got everything off this boss. When he is downed, you automatically /roll, and let's pretend the threshold is a 18, 19 or 20 on a d20 roll. He rolls a 5 - he doesn't get loot. You roll a 19. You get loot. You were not rolling against him - if he rolled a nat 20 instead you both get loot. In theory, every person in the raid could get loot, though probability doesn't tend toward that. <br />
<br />
He can curse the heavens - but he's cursing against luck, not you. You didn't take loot. You're not looking around at the other players and hoping there aren't too many people on your token - you just pays your monies (by beating the boss) and takes your chances.</div></div><hr />

How do people still not understand that whether or not someone else wins has no affect on whether someone else can or can not win. A certain number of people do not win, a certain standard of &quot;roll&quot; wins. So if the win threshhold is a 80 and all 25 people roll above 80, then they all get loot. Or if no one rolls above 80 than no one gets loot. Although they have mentioned that they may put in some mechanic that prevents those extremes. The point is that one person's win/loss doesnt affect another person's.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard says: Most importantly, winning a bonus roll has no effect on what other players win on their bonus rolls or what the boss drops normally. If you have saved up several Charms (this will probably happen when you play but don't raid every week) then you can use one per boss, but you can't cash in multiples on a single boss kill. If you want to save up all of your Charms for the final boss because he (or she in the case of the mantid raid) drops weapons or whatever, that is your prerogative, but you'll only be able to spend one per kill. If you want to save up your Charms for heroic bosses, go for it. It says if you want to save up your charms for heroic bosses go for it, so does that mean there implementing this into regular raiding or is this talking about 5 man heroic bosses?</div></div><hr />

How would it kill the PVP aspect,<br />
What if they decide only the raid that does the most damage get's loot? Do you then use 40 people to do as much damage as possible or do you split your raid to take out the other faction and DPs the boss?<br />
What if the world bosses are in an area that enables PVP against anyone not in your raid?<br />

Why would someone want to pass on an item you can vendor for probably a good amount of gold if you have it already? Why that bothers you is beyond me, especialy when it does not affect your chances at loot at all. <br />

Why the hell would I not pass? Sure, if I'm running with a friend and he needs it, that's understandable although not the kind of behavior I'd encourage as Blizzard. But considering I'm running with complete strangers... I'm sorry, maybe I'm missing something extremely simple here, but I cannot understand the logic behind this.<br />
<br />
The upgraded looting feature has glaring issues however. Consider I win an item I don't need, either I have something better or even the most ridiculous scenario, I have the exact item already. What the hell do I do with it? Sell it to a vendor or disenchant it for few golds? Why? There's probably someone in the group who has been running the stupid instance for weeks to get that item? Can I at least trade it to him to make him happy? Also if I can trade it, don't you think anyone winning an item isn't going to be whisper spammed to death by everyone who wants the item?<br />

There's room for improvement in the planned system. Maybe have the system check ilvl for every player and don't give an item to someone who already has better item ilvl wise?</div></div><hr />

Now instead of having a 1/7 or 1/8 chance of winning your piece of loot, you have a 1/25 for every single drop. And oh, Good Guy Timmy the full Heroic warrior decided to run his LFR today, he wins 5 pieces because he's a lucky guy! Too bad he can't trade you the items he doesn't need but has been assigned with no way to pass. Why would you not enable a pass loot option.

It's personal loot. Everybody has the same chance. Someone passing will not increase the other players chance of getting an item. It's a simply personal 50/50 roll of &quot;You won&quot; or &quot;You lose&quot;. There is no &quot;You definitely win&quot; when someone passes.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nelrock</div><div class="date">2012-03-27, 05:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wonder if they have the foresight to put class specific loot on every boss. Is there going to be more than 1 item, so you don't get the same thing over and over? If there's nothing on the boss for your class...do you still get a winning roll? Does that win take away from the total awarded? Shared loot tables may be the best option here.<br />
<br />
Valor...I like the idea, but what about the reason it was put in to begin with? To compensate for bad luck and keep people in a group? If somebody only needs something off the first boss...and they don't get it...why are they staying? So they can make a minor upgrade to an item (if they haven't already)?<br />
Personally I don't see a problem with buying tier items. If I want some new duds, I don't kill somebody and take theirs, I work...make money...and go to the store and buy some. Even if it takes a month to buy an item...it's better than hearing &quot;RNG is RNG&quot; over and over. Been raiding DS since it dropped and STILL haven't ever seen a number of items. Which has been the case for every raid tier. RNG isn't RNG. RNG is CRAP.</div></div><hr />

OT , I like the changes they are making. As metioned I hope they implement it for dugeons as well. I also hope you don't lose the loot if your bags are full, I wonder how they will handle that.<br />

How often do you run around with full bags?<br />

In that case they'll probably just do like they did if oyu had full bags and get a Cache or back when they offered you Badges off of bosses: it'll come to you via mail from the Twisting Nether.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In LFR/World Raid Boss kills, rolling works as follows:<br />
- Boss dies<br />
- Everyone has a chance at loot, INDEPENDENT of anyone else winning loot. All 25 (or 40 in the world boss case?) CAN win an item, if there is an appropriate one to be won.<br />
- If you do not win/do not like what you won, you can use a Charm of Good Fortune to buy a re-roll basically. But that re-roll will count as your loot for that boss for the week (in the case of LFR).</div></div><hr />

Im really interested on how the world bosses are going to work.

It will probably end up more as 3-4 guilds banded together rather than a random guy waiting gets invited like GC thinks. I also think they are the reason Have Group Will Travel is going away so that 1 player cant camp the boss and summon everyone right when it spawns.

Why? This is only LFR, and frankly, it is a better system than it is now.<br />
<br />
The odds of 25 people all getting loot-valid rolls is gonna be huge.<br />
<br />
It also means that people with the item you want already, or better gear even, CANNOT impact you getting the time. How is that bad? I've lost Gurthalaks and Souldrinkers to Warriors and DKs that have 1-2 of them already. There is a TON of inherent problems right now with the system, that this fixes.</div></div><hr />

Well, to the first question about using this system in Normal-mode.... it isn't for Normal. It's for LFR and World Bosses only. If you go into Normal Mogu'shan Temple, it will be the raid leader's loot settings, just like live.</div></div><hr />

I do think they should allow you to select if you want to roll for gear from your main spec or your off spec before queuing in the raid/dungeon.<br />

Says nothing about able to win a item you already have in either inventory or @ bank. You should not be able to if you ask me.<br />
Also, says nothing about the Gurthalak-issue (correct me if I'm wrong). Today pallys (any specc and role) can roll and win it. Same goes for DK's (no, it ain't a tank weapon, even if blood use 2h's).<br />
Same goes for a few trinkets.<br />
<br />
Also, will there be some built-in filtration depending on afk ppl etc? As it is now, ppl want and are kicking afk ppl (seen a few just standing still and also die by will, just to do as little as possible on a few bosses, specially DW). Those should not be able to win items at all.<br />

At least set some active-in-fight aspects into the rolls. If using skills less than 20% of the time (or whatever the absolut minimum would be) then not able to roll. Also gives a warning when you're below that part of eligible players.<br />

Also, as said before (several times). Give PvP-gear a own category when counting ilvl for gear. Count pvp-gear as heirloom (lvl 1) or something. No one really want them for PvE-content, same as PvP-players don't want PvE-players in BG's.<br />

Or ou can win, but then the 4th roll gets loot too (assuming 3 loots / boss). I wouldn't like to &quot;ninja&quot; someone chance to loot by getting an useless item.<br />
<br />
You're not going to &quot;ninja&quot; others. It doesn't matter what you roll or not. You're not rolling against them, if everyone is lucky, the boss could actually drop 25 items, 1 for each player if every single one of them got a lucky roll against THE GAME.<br />

Even more if ppl use the charms, you could get 50 items of a single boss.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Everyone will roll, whether they want or not, whether they need items or not, whether there is even appropriate loot for them on the boss. At worst, the 4 rogues win the rolls, but there is no leather or Agi weapon on the boss's loot table, so they all get some gold, but no one gets an item. A let-down for the whole raid.<br />
Another, personal example: you are helping a friend's alt of the same class by queueing as a healer/tank. You win many rolls for gear you don't need anymore, but your friend wins nothing.<br />
You cannot even pass to increase the chances of your friend, or just those of the randoms you queued with.<br />
<br />
Basically, instead of the 3-10 applicable players rolling on a drop now, all 25 players roll &quot;Need&quot; on anything that drops.</div></div><hr />

There is no loot to be &quot;awarded&quot;<br />
Everyone rolls independently of everyone else.<br />
Say the magic number is 80 or higher.<br />
The game will internally roll 1 - 100 for all 25 people. <br />
6 of them may roll higher than 80. The game then looks at the class and spec of those 6 people and awards them spec appropriate loot from the loot table.</div></div><hr />

Valor (or the various other names that the currency has had over the years) was originally added to WoW for two reasons: it helped to mitigate really bad luck, for those times when the boss just refused to drop the item you wanted, and it helped encourage players to stay with the group even if they didn't need anything off the next boss.Over time, we have felt like Valor has taken on too prominent a role, to the point that it risks becoming more important than actual boss loot. This is particularly the case when the tier sets are available on the Valor vendors. We think killing dragons and ransacking their hoard is more epic than shopping at the magic armor store, so we want to shift back toward boss kills being the primary source of epic PvE gear.In Mists of Pandaria, Valor will be used to power a new feature that allows you to increase the item level of your existing epic items. This means that each week, you can become a little more powerful, hopefully allowing you to kill that boss that has eluded you thus far.&quot;I have a problem with this. First of all NOT all slot items have been added to the game to buy with valor points. My holy pally has lost spell power shield 3 times that I've ever seen it drop and 2 shammies out of 3 losses had 410 item shields. I do not have a single shield option to use with valor points nor weapon. I can't get a tanking sword either because the one I have is ivll 308 and blue and in LFG pug usually I get a dps warr who rolls with me need on tanking sword for his offspec and wins it. Then it's again circle of 22. I can't tank in LFR because my ilevel isn't high enough due to low level sword that I don't plan on enchanting. I can't get new loot because I lose rolls in 5 man to dps classes because there's no bonus roll in LFG. I can't buy a weapon off AH because I don't want to waste 10k gold to buy ilvl 359 sword.Now they are announcing that with valor you'll be able to make your gear more powerful.....</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's a rough one - sadly I think BLizz's best option here is to just let players patrol themselves. The one big thing to remember though is even if jerkoff gets a roll for loot, it doesn't hurt your chances for it either, so there's less reason to worry about one schmuck not carrying his weight. <br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Well PVP gear wouldn't be dropping in PVE content - and they do have a new system for balancing out PVP/PVE gear (so PVP gear isn't useless in PVE, just less desirable, and PVE people can get into PVP without having to grind a whole set of armor just to survive first).</div></div><hr />

Wrong.<br />
There is no item dropping.<br />
You are rolling 1 - 100.<br />
Let's say you need to roll above an 80 to win loot(made up number)<br />
If you roll a 66 you win nothing.<br />
If you roll an 86 you win loot that is appropriate to you spec from the loot table.<br />
You aren't rolling against anyone but probability.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's the same thing as complaining about loot from event bosses. Everyone gets a satchel from the boss. You open and see if you're lucky, you're not rolling and winning what shows up on the satchel of the other player in your group.<br />
<br />
Ppl don't get that this is actually way faster to gear now, you're not throwing 25 players to roll on 4 itens (where most of the time, you can't even roll on it since it's not even for your class). That's why they're thinking about using valor points to buy gear or not. It's not needed anymore basically. There will be plenty of reputation gear, crafting gear, world drops, 5man heroic gear and pvp gear to get at each new tier. The odds of getting way more than &quot;4 items per boss&quot; is stupidly higher now, if you take into account the charms... it's &quot;worse&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Everyone will roll, whether they want or not, whether they need items or not, whether there is even appropriate loot for them on the boss. At worst, the 4 rogues win the rolls, but there is no leather or Agi weapon on the boss's loot table, so they all get some gold, but no one gets an item. A let-down for the whole raid.<br />
Another, personal example: you are helping a friend's alt of the same class by queueing as a healer/tank. You win many rolls for gear you don't need anymore, but your friend wins nothing.<br />
You cannot even pass to increase the chances of your friend, or just those of the randoms you queued with.<br />
<br />
Basically, instead of the 3-10 applicable players rolling on a drop now, all 25 players roll &quot;Need&quot; on anything that drops.<br />
<br />
Even if there was the option of passing, and if 24 players passed, that single player would still have the same chance of getting an item.</div></div><hr />

I can't imagine BLizz would develop a loot table where a class doesn't have at least ONE drop, probably more. Can you find a boss like that in Cata? I just looked through Demon Soul's loot list on Wowhead and couldn't find a boss that didn't have at least one piece of loot for a class. <br />
<br />
And they're doing this specifically to stop you're personal example. That's not fair to people single-queueing that you can roll to help your buddy.<br />
<br />
And you'er not rolling for drops, you're simply rolling to see if you get loot at all - then your loot is selected.</div></div><hr />

<br />
How is that any different than now - you are in a group, you kill the boss, and two pieces of Intellect plate drop. Except you have no Paladins in your raid group. So in this case the only good that came from that boss is one, possibly two, people gets some gold or possible enchanting mats.<br />
<br />
At least with the changes EVERYONE has a chance of USEABLE loot guaranteed, versus the current system where the number of items that drop is limited (which means for sure at least some group members can not get loot) AND the loot isn't spec specific.<br />
<br />
Yes...you may get a repeat of the same piece, just like how my guild saw Muradin's Spyglass drop every week for 7 weeks from Gunship. <br />
<br />
It is still a better system than what we have currently.<br />
<br />
Also, they've stated that they've put some mechanics into place behind the scene to make sure at least someone wins loot (my guess - the loot check is made. Computer determines 0 winners. This triggers the failsafe roll, until at least a certain minimum threshold is reached (prolly 2 in 10 man, and 5 in 25 man)</div></div><hr />

Why the hell would I not pass? Sure, if I'm running with a friend and he needs it, that's understandable although not the kind of behavior I'd encourage as Blizzard. But considering I'm running with complete strangers... I'm sorry, maybe I'm missing something extremely simple here, but I cannot understand the logic behind this.<br />
<br />
The upgraded looting feature has glaring issues however. Consider I win an item I don't need, either I have something better or even the most ridiculous scenario, I have the exact item already. What the hell do I do with it? Sell it to a vendor or disenchant it for few golds? Why? There's probably someone in the group who has been running the stupid instance for weeks to get that item? Can I at least trade it to him to make him happy? Also if I can trade it, don't you think anyone winning an item isn't going to be whisper spammed to death by everyone who wants the item?<br />
<br />
There's room for improvement in the planned system. Maybe have the system check ilvl for every player and don't give an item to someone who already has better item ilvl wise?<br />
<br />
Why would the system wont give you the item because you alread had a higher ilvl? You don't want it because you have better, don't run LFR.<br />
<br />
What? So the other player won't be sad that you got 1 item while he didn't? Like when you get sad running brewfest boss and see the guy next to you opening HIS PERSONAL satchel and looting the ram or the kodo and you just looting justice points and get sad?<br />
<br />
It's exactly like the world event satchels, it does not have a single impact on the other players chances.</div></div><hr />

The LFR way wasn't perfect by any means, but the biggest problems were that some people needed on items they didn't need, and the tables were broken seeing as how Ret Paladins could win holy gear etc. This new way does not solve either of those problems. Now instead of having a 1/7 or 1/8 chance of winning your piece of loot, you have a 1/25 for every single drop. And oh, Good Guy Timmy the full Heroic warrior decided to run his LFR today, he wins 5 pieces because he's a lucky guy! Too bad he can't trade you the items he doesn't need but has been assigned with no way to pass. Why would you not enable a pass loot option. If someone is nice enough to say, I don't want this loot because I'm not a jerk, LET THEM PASS ON IT.<br />
<br />
Because ppl would start to exploit running a raid full of druids, paladins, etc. to bias the loot system in dropping only paladin gear, druid gear, etc...<br />
<br />
&quot;It's not rocket science&quot;...<br />
<br />
Your loot chance didn't change, check your math, it actually increased. You're rolling against the game, not the other players anymore.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Everyone will roll, whether they want or not, whether they need items or not, whether there is even appropriate loot for them on the boss. At worst, the 4 rogues win the rolls, but there is no leather or Agi weapon on the boss's loot table, so they all get some gold, but no one gets an item. A let-down for the whole raid.<br />
Another, personal example: you are helping a friend's alt of the same class by queueing as a healer/tank. You win many rolls for gear you don't need anymore, but your friend wins nothing.<br />
You cannot even pass to increase the chances of your friend, or just those of the randoms you queued with.<br />
<br />
Basically, instead of the 3-10 applicable players rolling on a drop now, all 25 players roll &quot;Need&quot; on anything that drops.<br />
<br />
Nobody will be rolling against anyone with this new system, nobody will 'win' rolls from other players anymore. Every player just rolls 1-100 for himself, and if he rolls higher than an imaginary treshold number (let's say 80), he gets an item. This has nothing to do with other players in the group. For example on one boss, all 25 players might get loot, and on the next boss, nobody might get loot. <br />
<br />
The system now means that there is a chance to have your loot drop, and even IF it drops, you have to roll against X other imbeciles who might not even need the item. With the new system there is only one roll, a personal roll to check if you win something. If you do, you get your item. No interference with other players.</div></div><hr />

The post specifically says &quot;spec&quot; on multiple occasions and not &quot;role&quot;. Will your loot be determined by the spec you are currently in, or by the role that you entered the LFR as? If the former, I expect to see people queueing as a healer and then possibly going to a dps/tank spec for the boss fight if they want a particular piece of gear for those specs. Also, dpsers going to tank spec to gear up for that role.<br />
<br />
It seems like the system should be determining loot based on your role in LFR and not just your current spec.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Azrile</div><div class="date">2012-03-27, 05:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I see flaws now already. Thank god it's in beta-state! :D<br />
<br />
Says nothing about able to win a item you already have in either inventory or @ bank. You should not be able to if you ask me.<br />
Also, says nothing about the Gurthalak-issue (correct me if I'm wrong). Today pallys (any specc and role) can roll and win it. Same goes for DK's (no, it ain't a tank weapon, even if blood use 2h's).<br />
Same goes for a few trinkets.<br />
<br />
Also, will there be some built-in filtration depending on afk ppl etc? As it is now, ppl want and are kicking afk ppl (seen a few just standing still and also die by will, just to do as little as possible on a few bosses, specially DW). Those should not be able to win items at all.<br />
<br />
At least set some active-in-fight aspects into the rolls. If using skills less than 20% of the time (or whatever the absolut minimum would be) then not able to roll. Also gives a warning when you're below that part of eligible players.<br />
<br />
Also, as said before (several times). Give PvP-gear a own category when counting ilvl for gear. Count pvp-gear as heirloom (lvl 1) or something. No one really want them for PvE-content, same as PvP-players don't want PvE-players in BG's.<br />
<br />
There is craftable PvE AND PvP-items for a reason if you ask me. :)<br />
<br />
You should probably spend more time reading and less posting.<br />
<br />
1. He said specifically that they did not want looting to be Â´more efficientÂ´ for players. You get duplicates, you get duplicates. End of story. This change was NOT made to allow you to get items at a faster rate.. it was added to take the social drama away from LFR. End of story<br />
<br />
2. Yeah yeah.. only top 3 dps get loot, only top healer gets loot.. anyone who dies should never get loot. All stupid rules. That is one of the aspects of this change.. if someone does less DPS than you and wins an item, it has no effect on if you can win an item.<br />
<br />
3. Obviously you missed all the talk about pvp gear. The devs actually do want you to pvp with pve gear if you are just getting started. Also, the ilvl of pvp gear will be lower than equivalent pve gear, so we wonÂ´t have issues like the beginning of cata where people used craftable pvp gear to beat the barriers for LFD.<br />
<br />
So yeah.. next time please read before you post. everything you said has already been covered many times.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">VanishO2</div><div class="date">2012-03-27, 05:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So...there's a possibility 25 items are handed out? I have a hard time believing that.<br />
<br />
Not only 25, but more if you get ppl with the charms for extra rolls.<br />
<br />
You could get 25 drops x number of bosses.<br />
<br />
In a raid like DS, with 8 bosses, the raid could be lucky and get 200 drops from it, 25 from each boss. And it could be even higher with everyone carrying charms and winning the extra rolls.<br />
<br />
That's why they're considering not selling valor gear. it will be freaking fast to gear.</div></div><hr />

When you win, your roll is converted into a random appropriate from the boss's loot table.<br />
<br />
In theory, yes, but I bet Blizz would not let that happen - if less then 2 people win they just do a reroll or automatically change the threshold or something like that.<br />
<br />
All i know is in my heroic raids, plenty of times people don't walk out with loot - just last week we had 3 heroic bosses downed where they dropped needless tokens (we're vendoring/sharding heroic Pal/Pri/War tokens while there are members of our raid on the War/Hunt/Sham token who haven't even gotten normal versions of some gear yet) and other gear that wasn't needed. THat's just RNG.</div></div><hr />

What you get has no effect on what others get, and if you win 2 of the same items in 2 week, that is no different the way boss drops work now. It is now up in the hands of the RNG gods. I hope they change nothing, this is exactly what the game needed. Also, there is no more rolls at all, please remember that. Kill boss, maybe get loot, might be a new piece, might be the same one you got 3 weeks in a row. RNG</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ye this is an issue they somehow need to look at. <br />
<br />
Its ok for the same item to drop again and again and again when everyone can loot it. But its kinda depressing to think that some one person might have 4 drops of the same item on the same boss but zero items from the next 3 bosses. And thats whole month of subscription fee. <br />

Not only the actual features but also the tone.He sounds like he's really confident about the changes and has a clear perspective on how they'll work out. That's always good to hear when a designer has a clear vision. Something I felt a bit lacking in Cataclysm.Now if only they added the item-squish, I'd be a lot moire excited.<br />
<br />
They did the math, going forward and I guess they feel the Item Squish isn't required right now... when they talked about it, they were more concerned about the future, I think. and they did go with the MegaDamage option they talked about - just shrinking numbers down.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">VanishO2</div><div class="date">2012-03-27, 05:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So the question I have is, how do mounts work? They said the world bosses will drop mounts and now they are also using the new loot system which if you want your guild can use in normal raids. So if you kill the world boss and win a &quot;roll&quot; does it have a 50:50 chance of giving you the mount if only 1 piece of gear is useable for you or is it like 95:5 in favor of gear? Also do the lucky charms also give you a chance to win mounts? <br />
<br />
Im really interested on how the world bosses are going to work. It seems that you will want a full 40man raid to take them down but how many people would you actually need to kill it without interference? It will probably end up more as 3-4 guilds banded together rather than a random guy waiting gets invited like GC thinks. I also think they are the reason Have Group Will Travel is going away so that 1 player cant camp the boss and summon everyone right when it spawns. They want people to fight over the area with full groups for a while but you will probably have a bunch of mounted flyers that try to swoop in and tag the boss when it spawns.<br />
<br />
The same way the mount drops work from world event bosses like brewfest. Mount is a loot that every class is elegible for, so everyone will be able to get one.<br />
<br />
But unless they grant the mount for each kill like a heroic final boss from a xpac raid like H-Rag or H-Madness, it's probably really low chance like the world events. So you need to win the roll for a loot, then roll a mount instead of a gear.</div></div><hr />

That's what the blue post says. That means that in theory, all 25 players can win something, and it is also possible for nobody to win anything. At least, that's how I understood it.<br />
<br />
Way it sounds to me.<br />
I'm sure folks will argue the probability of either...but...I wouldn't think the same dagger would drop every single week from MoD...yet it seems to.</div></div><hr />

The LFR way wasn't perfect by any means, but the biggest problems were that some people needed on items they didn't need, and the tables were broken seeing as how Ret Paladins could win holy gear etc. This new way does not solve either of those problems. Now instead of having a 1/7 or 1/8 chance of winning your piece of loot, you have a 1/25 for every single drop. And oh, Good Guy Timmy the full Heroic warrior decided to run his LFR today, he wins 5 pieces because he's a lucky guy! Too bad he can't trade you the items he doesn't need but has been assigned with no way to pass. Why would you not enable a pass loot option. If someone is nice enough to say, I don't want this loot because I'm not a jerk, LET THEM PASS ON IT.<br />

This whole post just makes me want to cry due to your lack of understanding.</div></div><hr />

Well this system won't be active for Heroics - so that's not a giant concern. I doubt any Raid Finder boss will have a mount attached.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1) it's another attempt to force more and more casual/solo players into raiding by providing fewer opportunities to earn gear outside of the raid environment - GC says so much in the article - and the fact there will be some epics from the Elders faction available doesn't minimize the issue because those will only be useful in the 1st tier of MoP (they have never upgraded the fraction loot during the course of an expansion).<br />
<br />
2) the fact that valor points will allow you to upgrade your gear by up to 8 ilvls (see article) means, quite contrary to their brief flirtation with item squishing, that the difference in the ilvls of the tiers will have to be that much greater to compensate. So not only are they not squishing they are actually increasing the inflation rate of gear stats...just amazing that could do such a 180 degree turn on this subject and make the situation worse and the ultimate item squish they will have to do seem that much worse by comparison.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Everyone will roll, whether they want or not, whether they need items or not, whether there is even appropriate loot for them on the boss. At worst, the 4 rogues win the rolls, but there is no leather or Agi weapon on the boss's loot table, so they all get some gold, but no one gets an item. A let-down for the whole raid.<br />
Another, personal example: you are helping a friend's alt of the same class by queueing as a healer/tank. You win many rolls for gear you don't need anymore, but your friend wins nothing.<br />
You cannot even pass to increase the chances of your friend, or just those of the randoms you queued with.<br />
<br />
Basically, instead of the 3-10 applicable players rolling on a drop now, all 25 players roll &quot;Need&quot; on anything that drops.<br />
<br />
. I am very certain that every boss will have an item on itÂ´s loot table for every spec. If you go look at Cata boses it was probably true, and will definitely be true for the new system. Secondly, players will ONLY get gold/gems(boobie prize) if they use the Lucky Charm item.<br />
<br />
Your second example is true.. but it is also an exploit used frequently in the current system and unfair to the players not in that guild. Yes, you are helping your guildmate, but it is at the expense of other players in your group..</div></div><hr />

<br />
Two parts to this. One, you, like a few other people are still not understanding that you winning an item does not mean someone else does not get that item, multiple copies of the same item can be won. Two, in the case of getting bad luck and receiving the same piece when you want a different piece of the boss. It's not a reasonable concern. That can heppen now. Not only do you currently need that specific item to drop off the boss, but then you have to fight other people for it.</div></div><hr />

Items don't &quot;drop&quot; anymore. If Person B wins the item you really wanted, that has nothing to do with the boss.<br />

Why would you want to pass on a roll in this system? Ever? Even if you already had the 1 item in the loot table that could be considered useful, you would just get that item and vendor. Free ~20g for each time you won a roll. You passing has no affect on anyone else. You would just be voluntarily be throwing away money.

Agree. Although, my problem isn't really this so much as it is just my own rotten luck. I've been exalted with the oracles and have purchased enough eggs to fill Grommash Hold and have gotten several of everything EXCEPT the mount. I could recount all of the mounts, items, fishing tournaments that have left me disappointed every week, but it would be way too long for one post. This new system virtually guarantees that ONLY luck affects your chance at receiving gear upgrades in LFR. I personally will not be taking part in LFR or any other part of the game that uses this loot system, not when I can at the very least coerce my guildies to take pity on me and give gear to me in normal raids to help me at least gimp along behind them.</div></div><hr />

2) That post was just a layout of possible future concerns, not something they were going to do because it was the biggest technical hurdle in the game. They did choose to do the &quot;Megadamage&quot; option where numbers get shrunk down on screen using metric classifers (but not in the game's system) just for screen real estate considerations (So instead of seeing 103239 for my Lava Lash hit, I instead see 103K). Later on down the road, it might get to a point where the gamen can't keep up with the huge math pools - that's when an item squish might be necessary. But I doubt that time is now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I got Bloodfang boots in Blackrock before I even saw(saw, actually dropping, not win with dkp) Nightslayer boots from running MC for months. <br />
<br />
I think the biggest problem for this system is a perception issue. It does not look to what we are used to and not being able to pass on loots so a friend might win it (people can trade now anyways).<br />
<br />
<br />
Think of it as this way.<br />
<br />
Boss Dies.<br />
Everyone in the LFR rolls a D10. Everyone who rolled a 10 wins some random piece of loot good for their spec. You could in essence have 25 people win on one boss, or 0 people. I think this bothers people and seeing that a boss could drop more than 3-5 items. <br />
Sure I could win a loot roll on Shaz every week in Molten Core, but I might never get those Nightslayer Boots like I did in classic.<br />
<br />
<br />
This is for the casual raiders to experience the content and a quick way for raiding guilds to supplement gear people might need to raid normals they can not get in heroics. Now you don't have to worry about people being so greedy needing stuff they do not need, to sell, to trade, to disenchant. Once that first people did it everyone started to do it to fight back.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's not necessarily true. Yes we can upgrade by 8 ilvls, but that doesn't mean that the tiers will farther apart than normal. You can still upgrade the ilvl of the drops from a new raid, so perhaps the raids will be tuned a bit higher than usual to encourage players to improve their gear even when it drops from the same raid.</div></div><hr />

Although, my problem isn't really this so much as it is just my own rotten luck. I've been exalted with the oracles and have purchased enough eggs to fill Grommash Hold and have gotten several of everything EXCEPT the mount. I could recount all of the mounts, items, fishing tournaments that have left me disappointed every week, but it would be way too long for one post. This new system virtually guarantees that ONLY luck affects your chance at receiving gear upgrades in LFR. I personally will not be taking part in LFR or any other part of the game that uses this loot system, not when I can at the very least coerce my guildies to take pity on me and give gear to me in normal raids to help me at least gimp along behind them.<br />

Item drops, system checks your inventory including bags and bank, if you have the item you can't roll. Simple. In the case of tier pieces it can do a 1/2/3 check and even assign priority. If you have zero, you get it. If you have 1 set piece of that type you lose 20 pts on your roll, 2 set pieces of that type you lose 50 pts, 3 set pieces of that type you can't roll.

Say a 3rd of the raid doesn't need loot off a boss, it selects people in that third, they get loot. Everyone else is screwed. Where as in our way now, if you don't need gear and you are a good person, you can pass and not screw other people out of loot.<br />
<br />
That could happen, but it seems like more loot will be dropping now so that would partially offset that problem. If you're getting twice as much loot off a boss AND each time you *win* it's spec-specific, I'd say an individual's chance of gearing up is much greater.</div></div><hr />

As for valor, What about those people who are not in a raiding guild? Some of us are not fortunate or do not want to be in a snobbish guild that has a raid first mentality.<br />
<br />
As for the beta invites.. Blizzard has opened themselves up for problems. Those of us with the Annual pass are supposed to get automatic invites. However, people without the Annual pass HAVE BEEN invited already. I know several. Annual pass signups should have at least gotten in before non annual pass.<br />

<br />
yeah, that's probably close to it. we're not sure the threshold, but it won't matter: that roll is invisible to the player anyway, it would seem.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">VanishO2</div><div class="date">2012-03-27, 06:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">And there I see a problem.<br />
<br />
Everyone will roll, whether they want or not, whether they need items or not, whether there is even appropriate loot for them on the boss. At worst, the 4 rogues win the rolls, but there is no leather or Agi weapon on the boss's loot table, so they all get some gold, but no one gets an item. A let-down for the whole raid.<br />
Another, personal example: you are helping a friend's alt of the same class by queueing as a healer/tank. You win many rolls for gear you don't need anymore, but your friend wins nothing.<br />
You cannot even pass to increase the chances of your friend, or just those of the randoms you queued with.<br />
<br />
Basically, instead of the 3-10 applicable players rolling on a drop now, all 25 players roll &quot;Need&quot; on anything that drops.<br />
<br />
You just want to be a personal charm of extra loot for others. That would lead to exploits and bad behavior as it happens today with ppl needing to trade/sell.<br />
<br />
The rogues who got gold, got it for helping the boss and ease their repairs. When you don't get a drop from the boss it's like you're a DK and the boss dropped spelldps cloth.<br />
<br />
Nothing else, ppl are just trying to do some gain over things that never existed in the 1st place just because the new system could allow it to happen now. &quot;oh, now I always have a shot at a drop for each boss and not ninja others? WHY CAN'T I SELL MY ROLLS?!?!? THIS SYSTEM SUCKS HARD!&quot;, the way you guys want it to be, every single DK DPS would be a valuable source of plate dps drop to exploit the system to gear other plate dpsers with a good 50% chance for each boss. Remember, there is no chance of dropping 4 spellcaster cloth drops that only half (or lower) the raid could roll on it. You're basically guaranted a stupid high chance of dropping every kind of loot from each boss, all kinds of plate, leather, mail, cloth and weapons since there will be 25 players + charms.<br />
<br />
They would be really lame to allow players to exploit that kind of loot system.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Crashdummy</div><div class="date">2012-03-27, 06:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So let me get this straight.When a piece of gear drops now in the LFR the usefulness of that piece can range between 1-9 players given any number of variables. Drama only ensues when drama queens with purple fever start pissing and moaning, which usually is 1-2 people every other LFR group I am in. A very small group of losers.Now, instead of rolling on gear between 1-9 people, you will have to roll on gear between 24 people automatically for every chance?That is such a dumb system of loot.Glad Blizzard listened to drama loot whores.<br />
<br />
No, you will roll against one other. You roll against the system, if you get more than x number,. you get loot, independent of what other people roll.<br />
<br />
They said your roll will be independent of the rest of the raid.<br />
<br />
Thta's why they say people might still get mad but they will be mad at probability and not the rest of the raid.</div></div><hr />

You're getting really complicated there - the worst outcome with the system GC is proposing above is you get a piece of loot you all ready have, and you vendor or shard it.<br />
<br />
Also, again, you're ont rolling for Loot - you just roll for the chance at loot. What you get is a separate roll.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Azrile</div><div class="date">2012-03-27, 06:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In my opinion the valor changes are bad for 2 reasons:<br />
<br />
1) it's another attempt to force more and more casual/solo players into raiding by providing fewer opportunities to earn gear outside of the raid environment - GC says so much in the article - and the fact there will be some epics from the Elders faction available doesn't minimize the issue because those will only be useful in the 1st tier of MoP (they have never upgraded the fraction loot during the course of an expansion).<br />
<br />
2) the fact that valor points will allow you to upgrade your gear by up to 8 ilvls (see article) means, quite contrary to their brief flirtation with item squishing, that the difference in the ilvls of the tiers will have to be that much greater to compensate. So not only are they not squishing they are actually increasing the inflation rate of gear stats...just amazing that could do such a 180 degree turn on this subject and make the situation worse and the ultimate item squish they will have to do seem that much worse by comparison.<br />
<br />
1. No, they never have gone back and added Hyjal Rep items higher than 359. But they did add a new rep system ( MF) that gave new epic items and craftable epics, and they added quests (thralls love story) and also the new dungeon quests that added higher ilevel epics. This will definitely continue in MoP because they are well aware one of the biggest complaints about cata was the lack of things to do in the outside world. They will probably be adding reputations with each patch that will grant higher ilvl gear, probably more frequently than cata.<br />
<br />
2. It really is the same. Instead of using valor to upgrade 6 items a full tier, you will use valor to upgrade all your items slightly below a full gear. Your total ilvl increase will be probably about the same, but you wonÂ´t have to worry about enchanting, gemming or morging your gear constantly.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gsara</div><div class="date">2012-03-27, 06:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This new system is just as terrible as the last. The LFR way wasn't perfect by any means, but the biggest problems were that some people needed on items they didn't need, and the tables were broken seeing as how Ret Paladins could win holy gear etc. This new way does not solve either of those problems. Now instead of having a 1/7 or 1/8 chance of winning your piece of loot, you have a 1/25 for every single drop. And oh, Good Guy Timmy the full Heroic warrior decided to run his LFR today, he wins 5 pieces because he's a lucky guy! Too bad he can't trade you the items he doesn't need but has been assigned with no way to pass. Why would you not enable a pass loot option. If someone is nice enough to say, I don't want this loot because I'm not a jerk, LET THEM PASS ON IT.<br />
<br />
I think you need to reread the entire system of LFR loot in MoP. Im not sure if there is an easy reader version with big letters and simple words though, because your reading comprehension needs work.</div></div><hr />

He said specifically that they did not want looting to be Â´more efficientÂ´ for players. You get duplicates, you get duplicates. End of story. This change was NOT made to allow you to get items at a faster rate.. it was added to take the social drama away from LFR. End of story<br />
<br />
So they fix one problem by letting it be same, but making making an auto-roll instead of letting ppl roll need, if they already have it anyhow. That's just lol. :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
But everyone has the same autoroll each time. If I get loot doesn't relate to if you get loot. With the current system, more people rolling on something, less chance you have of getting it. Now it's independent of that - everyone rolls and everyone has the chance for something.</div></div><hr />

RNG is RNG after all.<br />
<br />
Except that they alread mentioned something about never letting the entire raid leave with 0 drops. Plus, you'll always get gold. Ppl need to forget what is happening with others around him. If you don't get a drop, it's like you're a hunter and the boss dropped a paladin and dk tier token + 2 spellcaster cloth.<br />
<br />
But the same way it will be really hard to get a full 25 item drop from a single boss, it will be equaly hard to get a 0 item.<br />
<br />
I'm tired of doing LFR and not getting a single item from all the 8 bosses. Not winning a roll and the boss not even dropping my class/spec gear, doesn't matter... it will be the same now, I just don't have to care about what happened to the other 24 players, only what I can get beating the game roll. If I leave the raid with 0 drops, it will be the same thing as today when I get 0 drops.<br />
<br />
Except my chances will be way higher in MoP and I'll even get extra gold.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The way the current system works...you roll...I roll...high roll wins.<br />
<br />
The new system...winning roll requires, for sake of arguement...75. You roll...I roll...we both roll higher than 75...we both win. One of us rolls higher than 75...that person wins. Neither of us rolls higher than 75...neither of us wins.<br />

The system is fine, but Blizz should do two things:<br />
<br />
A) Add a button &quot;I don't want something for free although it doesn't affect anyone else.&quot; That's for the people who want to pass. Oddly enough, this button exists already on the Need/Greed box and nobody uses it there either, maybe because you -can- ruin people's days there.<br />
<br />
B) They should remind everyone: Loot is supposed to be random and having one item from a boss should not guarantee you the other next week.</div></div><hr />

I'm sure folks will argue the probability of either...but...I wouldn't think the same dagger would drop every single week from MoD...yet it seems to.<br />
<br />
I am going to make a guess here. Suppose the devs have it in mind that on average, 4 people should win loot per boss. This means that 25 people will make a hidden roll, and anyone who beat 83 will win. On average, about 4 people will win.<br />
<br />
Ok...now suppose the statistics gods go crazy on that boss<br />
<br />
1. If NOBODY beats 83, my guess is that Blizzard will have a minimum... maybe 2 items. So the two highest rolls.. say 78 and 80 will win an item.<br />
<br />
2. They will also probably have a max.. say 7. So that if 9 people beat 83.. The two lowest rolls will not get an item even though they were above 83<br />
<br />
The thing is, NOBODY can see the actual rolls, so you wonÂ´t know if this happened to you. in #2, the two people who beat 83 but didnÂ´t get an item would have no way to tell that they beat 83..<br />
<br />
I am fairly certain Blizzard will not allow a situation where nobody gets loot, nor one where half the raid gets loot. Keep in mind, that 83, 2 and 7 used above were just examples.. they might change the min-max on a per boss basis. We wonÂ´t know because we donÂ´t see the rolls. If we start seeing fairly regular instances of where 7 people get loot, but never any where 8 people get loot, then we know what I said is true.</div></div><hr />

I only heard gold mentioned in relation to using a Pandaren token for a &quot;bonus roll&quot;. Unless you're talking about the base gold the boss has on them.<br />

Even with a lower %, the fact that you can get gear from other places like crafting, pvp, reputation, heroics, Normal/Heroic raid + LFR, etc. it will increase the pace that you get gear by a lot comparing to today's pace.<br />

If we start seeing fairly regular instances of where 7 people get loot, but never any where 8 people get loot, then we know what I said is true.<br />
<br />
The problem with that though is...it contradicts what they said. If nobody wins an internal...self loot roll...and the determining factor is comparing your self loot roll against others...for, lets say 4 loot spots...well then you are in fact competing against others.<br />
If they set it in the 70-75 range...I realize it's unlikely all 25 people will roll under that. I also have been playing WoW since it came out and know the games RNG does a lot of weird shit.</div></div><hr />

All those people want is free loot, so, why don't give them a bag with a piece of loot and valor points in the end of the run? (like low lvl dungeons)</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">VanishO2</div><div class="date">2012-03-27, 06:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In my opinion the valor changes are bad for 2 reasons:<br />
<br />
1) it's another attempt to force more and more casual/solo players into raiding by providing fewer opportunities to earn gear outside of the raid environment - GC says so much in the article - and the fact there will be some epics from the Elders faction available doesn't minimize the issue because those will only be useful in the 1st tier of MoP (they have never upgraded the fraction loot during the course of an expansion).<br />
<br />
2) the fact that valor points will allow you to upgrade your gear by up to 8 ilvls (see article) means, quite contrary to their brief flirtation with item squishing, that the difference in the ilvls of the tiers will have to be that much greater to compensate. So not only are they not squishing they are actually increasing the inflation rate of gear stats...just amazing that could do such a 180 degree turn on this subject and make the situation worse and the ultimate item squish they will have to do seem that much worse by comparison.<br />
<br />
But they gave you new factions with new higher ilvl gear. Some ppl mentioned things about the factions being always usefull for the entire xpac, by proving new stuff each tier.<br />
<br />
And yes, the ilvl will be a mess... they can't understand that, even when they understand the problem rising more and more... actually, they don't care probably. Looks like they don't expact WoW to hold long enough (titan?) for it to be a real problem (and by real problem, I mean players complaing A LOT, players leaving and etc.)</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Azrile</div><div class="date">2012-03-27, 06:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So they fix one problem by letting it be same, but making making an auto-roll instead of letting ppl roll need, if they already have it anyhow. That's just lol. :D<br />
<br />
But now that other person making a roll does not affect your roll. Is it really so hard to understand??<br />
<br />
Old system<br />
<br />
Hunter with ilvl 800 gloves rolls Â´needÂ´ on 372 gloves<br />
You roll need on 372 gloves.<br />
Hunter rolls 99, you roll 98... he gets gloves, you get nothing. You cry because he doesnÂ´t really need the item and he Â´tookÂ´your item.<br />
<br />
New system<br />
<br />
Hunter with ilvl 800 gloves rolls<br />
You roll<br />
Hunter rolls 99, you roll 98... he gets gloves, you get gloves.<br />
<br />
Stupid people should not Â´lol Â´ at people who are obviously smarter. Blizzard is doing EXACTLY what their intentions were.. they are removing loot drama. This system is NOT to make drops more efficient to get.. Do people know how to read?? they said that like 5 times.</div></div><hr />

Either if you are the only Paladin (insert class here) or the raid has 10 Paladins, your chance to loot is the same. Right now, I always count the Conqueror tier users in a LFR raid, as soon as I join. More than 9 people means I leave. Apparently, it won't matter with this new system. If this gets further implemented in more raid styles, there would be no more &quot;class runs&quot; for Bh and the like, since the loot chance will always be the same. No more warlock searching for Bh. 25 Druids gogogo</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">theturn</div><div class="date">2012-03-27, 06:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So does that mean its possible for everyone or no one to win on each boss? If that's not the case then yes other players are indirectly instead of directly effecting your loot chances. Add that to the valor point changes people like me who never win shit will be stuck in questing greens for a very long time.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Crashdummy</div><div class="date">2012-03-27, 06:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">How and why do people find this a good system?!? It's like the ultimate stupidity. You might win the same item four weeks in a row, while not getting the item you need (EVEN IF IT DROPS). There HAS and NEEDS to be some sort of &quot;This person already got this item, so if he wins the roll he gets something else class/spec appropraite - if nothing is available this person gets the ability to pass to the next highest roller or take the piece of loot for offspec/sell/de&quot;.<br />
<br />
Maybe because the people that like this system understood it and you didnt?<br />
<br />
The probability that you roll 4 times a high roll and win always the same items for your spec is much less than the probability of your item never dropping from the whole pool of loot from the boss in the first place, which is what happens now, especially in 10 mans.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Illitti</div><div class="date">2012-03-27, 06:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Why would the system wont give you the item because you alread had a higher ilvl? You don't want it because you have better, don't run LFR.<br />
LFR is not only one boss, one item. Maybe I want the ring from boss X but got the neck that I don't need from boss Y. Also maybe, in the same run, there's someone that gets loot right to the boss but doesn't need the item he gets while I get the item I don't need but he does. All this new system does is that a lot of people will get stuff that they won't need, which means the whole gearing process through LFR is going to be more tedious.<br />
<br />
Also, speaking of myself, I consistently run LFR with my hard mode geared main. Sometimes I do it to test some new spec, rotation or other thing, sometimes I just do it because I find it fun. I certainly don't need any loot and will automatically pass on everything. With this new system, I won't be allowed to do that, and that pisses me off.<br />
<br />
<br />
What? So the other player won't be sad that you got 1 item while he didn't? Like when you get sad running brewfest boss and see the guy next to you opening HIS PERSONAL satchel and looting the ram or the kodo and you just looting justice points and get sad?<br />
<br />
It's exactly like the world event satchels, it does not have a single impact on the other players chances.<br />
These two cases are entirely different. If I pass on loot, you have 24 people to roll against. If there's 4 others like me, running on high geared characters, testing stuff and having fun, you have 20 people who roll against you. With the new system, you always have 25 people rolling against you. This certainly does affect your chances of getting the item.<br />
<br />
The scenario you presented is entirely different, since someone getting an item from their personal satchel indeed has no impact on my chances of getting the item.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">VanishO2</div><div class="date">2012-03-27, 06:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just hope they find a way to incorporate the need for OS item rolls, or I will be attending LFR in my OS without any gear to be useful in that spec.<br />
<br />
And will probably be kicked :) Ppl in LFR are usually not nice... they won't care about your problem with OS gear and skipping all the other ways to get your OS gear before joining LFR.</div></div><hr />

Based on what Ghostcrawler said, the game would be handing out loot to players, even if they didn't want or need it. Let me quote two specific points fron the Dev Watercooler post.:<br />
Notice that you aren't rolling Need or Greed. You don't have an option to Pass. The game just says &quot;Take this.&quot;What? So to put this in current content terms: If I have legendary daggers, and I happened to win the &quot;background roll&quot; after killing a boss, I could potentially be awarded the downgrade dagger off the boss, even when there are alts and others who need this gear more?Also:<br />
You can't trade this item, or that would defeat the purpose of removing the social pressure on groups of strangers. If you don't want the item, you are free to vendor, delete, or disenchant it.This one just flat out confuses me. I'm not sure where this social pressure is coming from, i've certainly never experienced it in any of my LFR runs. Going back to my previous example of the daggers, why not allow me to give those daggers to another rogue who actually wanted them for an upgrade?This system would be a disaster if the expansion launched with it as-is.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">VanishO2</div><div class="date">2012-03-27, 06:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I only heard gold mentioned in relation to using a Pandaren token for a &quot;bonus roll&quot;. Unless you're talking about the base gold the boss has on them.<br />
That's why I mentioned RNG. Many things in WoW should have a low probability...yet seem to happen a lot.<br />
<br />
Don't need to heard, just read the news post<br />
<br />
&quot;If you have one or more Charms of Good Fortune, then whenever you kill a raid boss (in Raid Finder, normal or heroic) then a new UI window will pop up asking if you want to spend your Charm on a bonus roll. If you click yes, then you'll instantly get another shot at that boss's loot table! You will always win something from the bonus roll, such as a pile of gold, gems, or flasks. However, you also have a small (but not miniscule) chance of receiving a piece of epic loot.&quot;</div></div><hr />

Say a 3rd of the raid doesn't need loot off a boss, it selects people in that third, they get loot. Everyone else is screwed. Where as in our way now, if you don't need gear and you are a good person, you can pass and not screw other people out of loot.<br />
<br />
&quot;and you are a good person, you can pass and not screw other people out of loot&quot;, Man, did I laugh at that one:D</div></div><hr />

It's bad when an MMO, movie, song or book takes an idea from something else. When Steve Jobs does it, it's brilliant and he's suddenly an inventor who changed the world.</div></div><hr />

Because it wouldnt benefit other players if you passed. its a personal roll system, so no need at all for need/greed/pass.</div></div><hr />

will be rolling against YOU.<br />

And it doesn't matter if the game gives you the necklace you don't want. In todays system, you could still get the damn necklace dropping instead of the ring. And instead of all others having a chance of getting the same necklace more than once, you get a few ppl needing on the only drop of it to even troll.<br />
<br />
But again: NOBODY will be rolling against YOU! It's exactly the same thing as the satchel!!!!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Random loot is random, and the new loot system will ensure that whoever wins an item actually gets something they need. If you are gonna try and pull loot council on world bosses, piss off seriously.</div></div><hr />
