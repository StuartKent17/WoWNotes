Patch 7.2.5 - Developer Interview<br />
Bellular had the chance to talk to Lead Encounter Designer Morgan Day.<br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;iframe width=&quot;900&quot; height=&quot;180&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/B4ve-GRPU2Y?rel=0?ecver=1&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
Nighthold was tuned three times. Tomb was only tuned once because the team waited until towards the end of development. <br />
The pacing of Legion raids has worked out well. Legion was supposed to release content at a steady pace and the team has delivered on that. <br />
Trial of Valor did a great job of tying up the story.<br />
Helya was a good encounter, the team took a dungeon boss and turned it into a raid boss. <br />
In a Normal raid if an individual makes a mistake, that player could die. In a Mythic raid if an individual makes a mistake, especially towards the end, the team is more willing to wipe the entire raid. <br />
The person who created the NPC abilities for Timeless Isle was an encounter designer. The team tries to add more avoidable mechanics when they expect a high degree of difficulty. On Timeless Isle, the creatures were supposed to be difficult and require you to learn the mechanic to defeat them. <br />
The team tries to keep the Keystone Affixes in mind when designing dungeon trash. <br />
Tyrannical is cool, but sometimes there are debuffs that stack too high and make things too challenging. Targeted nerfs have been done to address this. <br />
Court of Stars added class specific mechanics in a way that wasn't very organic. Making a Rogue have an advantage due to Stealth letting you skip something, or a Hunter ability giving you an advantage would be a more organic way to do this. <br />
The team has a raid design kickoff meeting, comes up with a list of bosses, then sits down with the encounter designers to talk about high level design. From there an encounter designer will take it to completion. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Darkmoon Faire<br />
The Darkmoon Faire is in town once again! This is your chance to stock up on those Inky Black Potions (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/6506-Inky-Black-Potion-New-Darkmoon-Faire-Area-Blue-Posts-Tweets-StarCrafts).<br />
<br />
Keep in mind the Darkmoon Top Hat (http://www.wowdb.com/items/93730-darkmoon-top-hat) buff and the WHEE! (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/46668-whee) buff as you work on earning reputation with the Legion factions for Paragon reputation rewards (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/6491-Patch-7-2-Live-This-Week!#paragonRep).<br />

<br />
Class Mounts<br />
You will be able to earn your class mount this week with the completion of the Breaching the Tomb (http://www.wowdb.com/achievements/11546-breaching-the-tomb) achievement. Each class has a class specific quest line to complete to obtain the mount. You can see an example with the Mage class mount quests in this video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDwuZDReyVA).<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Power Ascended Rewards<br />
You will also be able to purchase some of the rewards from Power Ascended (http://www.wowdb.com/achievements/11772-power-ascended) this week if you have the achievement completed.<br />
<br />

<br />
World Quest Bonus Event<br />
An extra weekly quest and rewards are here.<br />
<br />
Get out your best map and plan your route across every part of the Broken Isles, as this is a great time to immerse yourself in World Quests.<br />
<br />
This Week<br />
All week, open your map (default hotkey: m) and then select any of the five main Broken Isles zones to consider the World Quests available to you. Hover your mouse over a World Quest on the map to see what tasks are needed complete it, the rewards you’ll receive, and the time remaining that the quest is available to you.<br />
<br />
Look for the following all week long:<br />
<br />
<br />
Archmage Lan’dalock near Violet Hold in Dalaran has a quest for you (http://www.wowdb.com/quests/44175-the-world-awaits).<br />
<br />
Quest requirement: Complete 20 World Quests<br />
Reward: 5,000 Order Resources<br />
<br />
Passive buff: +50% to Reputation gains from World Quests (http://www.wowdb.com/world-events/592-world-quest-bonus-event)<br />
<br />
<br />
If you’ve been looking to impress some emissaries, this is the week to do it!<br />
<br />
Every Week<br />
The Bonus Events system consists of a rotating schedule of different activities, currently scheduled to run each week beginning on Tuesdays. Each Bonus Event grants a passive bonus to a particular game activity and offers a once-per-event quest with a noteworthy reward for accomplishing a related goal. The in-game calendar can serve as your one-stop reference for the event schedule. The Adventure Guide also offers a direct link to active Bonus Events, allowing you to easily accept any associated quests.<br />
<br />
<br />

Blue Tweets<br />
If we haven't transfered, do we also need 150 wins for a title?<br />
Yes. 150 wins for Gladiator and Cruel Gladiator titles. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/869243376226385920))<br />
Ah ok, so it won't apply for me hoping for Duelist?<br />
Duelist, Rival, Challenger, etc are still 50 wins (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/869252813808836612))<br />

<br />
Yeah, but this time it's on the Broken Shore. Overall a very epic campaign that can go toe-to-toe with some of the best questing content in the game. Suramar pales in comparison.</div></div><hr />

Of course there was something to do because they warmed up the AP and legendary grinds with the 7.0 content, but this patch added nothing. Sentinax is a major disappointment for anyone who isnt a fresh 110 char, Invasions are so uncreative designed (lol at the Hightmountain one repeating the same quest steps pre and inside the scenario) - how this could even go live? Not to mention that Legion has the worst class balance since they started carring about class balance.</div></div><hr />

I actually loved the Suramar quests...so amazing and beautiful. Really felt the plight and challenge of the withered. Broken Shore was awesome getting my newly minted level 110 geared up fast. But after the nethershard nerf, it wasn't worth getting the epic tokens.<br />

Well could be worse I suppose since Warlocks have to wait for and complete a Legion Invasion event before they can get their mount.. The Shaman one changes on spec change, Wind for Enhancement, Fire for Elemental and so on..<br />
