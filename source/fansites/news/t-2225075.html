Patch 7.2.5 PTR - Build Deploy Delayed<br />
Hit a bit of a speed bump with the deploy. Work is continuing but we may have a couple more hours before the build is up and running. Thanks again for your patience.<br />

Patch 7.2.5 - Arms/Fury and Draught of Souls Changes<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/iwarriors.gif Warrior (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/278-Warrior) / Skills (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/warrior) / Talent Calculator (http://www.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#E) / Artifact Calculator (http://www.wowdb.com/artifact-calculator#F) / PvP Talent Calculator (http://www.wowdb.com/pvp-talent-calculator#E))<br />
Arms/Fury and Draught of Souls<br />
For Arms and Fury Warriors, we’re going to scale down the damage of Draught of Souls in the next build for the 7.2.5 PTR.<br />
<br />
Specifically, we’re aiming for a roughly 40% reduction in the effectiveness of Draught of Souls. For those two specs, it’s a trinket that is extremely valuable due to its interaction with Battle Cry. We’ve already tuned other forthcoming on-use trinkets that drop in Tomb of Sargeras for Arms and Fury with the same modifier to compensate for Battle Cry’s effectiveness in boosting trinkets of this kind. Our goal is for new trinkets to have more similar power levels between various specs, while leaving Draught of Souls in a place where it remains competitive for Arms and Fury.<br />
<br />
We’re making sure to consider this trinket change as we update Warriors in Patch 7.2.5. With this in mind, Fury damage has been increased by 5% across the board. Arms is currently in the middle of receiving some heavy mechanical changes which will require a deeper look into their overall performance, and we’ll account for this change when we do our final tuning. <br />
<br />
We don’t want Draught of Souls to define DPS Warriors for the remainder of the expansion, but we do want Warriors who have one to be able to make good use of it as they progress through Tomb of Sargeras.<br />
<br />
Thank you for all of your feedback!<br />

CoF had been nerfed since its original state, and its fine for it to be bis now. I'm sure if it remains bis for many classes in tomb it'll get knocked down a peg</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;We are nerfing this trinket by 40%&quot;<br />
<br />
trinket remains unchanged for every class except warriors, so it's more of a warrior nerf than a trinket nerf, since they're doing the same in ToS for ONLY warriors will get 40% less benefit from trinkets due to battlecry.<br />

The 5% buff for fury is way too low though. Should probably be more than 10% to compensate for the loss of draught damage.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaver</div><div class="date">2017-05-24, 07:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The crazy thing is that Blizzard waited so long to nerf this trinket for warriors. It does 10+ million dmg per use on a 1.5 min cooldown. Thats just crazy. And it is on the top of a lot of warriors dmg meters after boss fights. If you don't believe me try to simulate a top warrior (910+) with the trinket on Askmrrobot.com. A trinket shouldn't be able to do that. Please stop yourself if you think so xD</div></div><hr />

<br />
To those who complain about &quot;how much this trinket is overpowered&quot;, first of all, it is not, it simply benefit from all our dps cooldown, without them, it is not more powerfull than for another class. And second, this trinket is the only thing witch allow the fury warrior to be on the bottom, without it, we would merely be in the middle; and even with it, we are far from being first: frost mage and affliction demo are WAAAAY more overpowered, especialy with their wispers in the dark trinket, witch is, this time really, overpowered.</div></div><hr />

The problem was they knew this and had cba issues so rather than re-tune earlier, say in the ptr maybe, they just left it. <br />
It seemed fury's all round output was designed around this trinket. Is 5% flat damage buff enough to cover it though?</div></div><hr />

That wasn't the case for Paladins for example, that's why the devs were able to react quicker.<br />
<br />
BTW, there are already sims out there that confirm that the 5% buff is actually worth more than the trinket nerf.<br />

They just need to reduce the value of the proc, my whispers gives me 53% cast speed which is just disgusting. Making it so NH can't proc more than 925 and EN can't proc more than 900 would be a start (though it's too late), but they're going to HAVE to nerf Whispers, CoF and BTI currently because they're outright better than ToS shite.</div></div><hr />

Ye you need to put an asintotic limit to itm lvl proc and trinket power<br />
<br />
A 915 en trinket like bti can't be really better than a 900 or 920 from NH o Tos or any next raid, it just devalue the loot progression. <br />
<br />
You can at least limit them after a precise item lvl and then but a similar trinket in the next raid just to block the retro farming.</div></div><hr />

If you haven't cleared nh m/h by the time the changes come in then it's already too late. With the draught nerf will come tomb and hence loss of ahead of the curve and cutting edge achievements. So no need to do nh other than to see the bosses.</div></div><hr />

You may be a bit disabled. Live in that fantasy world. What i stated is 100% fact and there isn't a way to debate a fact.<br />
<br />
Blizzard said they wouldn't be nerfing any trinkets. They then nerf a trinket. It's really simple to understand.<br />
<br />
I look forward to the nerf.</div></div><hr />

as i said said you moron, they're not nerfing the trinket they're nerfing warriors scaling with the trinket, for rogues/unholy dk's etc it's not getting changed, so the trinket is unchanged! how a certain class interacts with it is changed, so the class was changed not the trinket.<br />
<br />
but instead you just run your mouth going LOL IM RIGHT FACT FACT, like a pathetic child.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When exactly does &quot;final tuning&quot; take place? End of xpac? Before TOS?</div></div><hr />

OMG you are right! They aren't nerfing the trinket! They are just nerfing the scaling of the trinket for a specific class so that the trinket does less damage! How could i be so blind?! It's not a nerf, it's just a nerf! I'm so foolish!</div></div><hr />

yeh it's not a trinket nerf, since it's a scaling nerf for warriors, therefore all trinkets are unchanged but how warriors interact with them is changed. if i use DoS on my shaman, nothing is changing the trinket as as same as it's always been. if the actual trinket was nerfed my shaman would deal less damage with DoS but no it remains the same, therefore no trinket nerf.<br />
<br />
and fury was buffed 5% for the fact the class doesn't scale as well with trinkets anymore.</div></div><hr />

So you are telling me it's not a nerf to the trinket, it's just a nerf to the trinket. Got it!</div></div><hr />
