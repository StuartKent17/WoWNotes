<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ideathknights.gif Death Knight - Higher resolution and 4 recolors available. Helm is still missing. <br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/idruids.gif Druid - Higher resolution, 3 recolors available.<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ihunters.gif Hunter - Higher resolution, 3 recolors available.<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/irogues.gif Rogue - Not in Blizzard's preview, 3 recolors available. (And found the Shoulders as well!) <br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/iwarriors.gif Warrior - Higher resolution, 4 recolors available.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/idruids.gif Druid Additional note: Blizzard used the same helm for both sets in their preview, I didn't. The model of this helm is kinda bugged at the moment and only supports one texture directly hardcoded in the .m2 file. I just decided to fix it and make sure that the colors of the helms match the armors, I'm not sure if what we saw in Blizzard's preview is a design choice or a bug. <br />

<br />
That's the normal recoloring they do for npcs etc. I think the only difference in color (if any) will be horde-alliance.<br />
<br />
Druid and especially Rouge are very nice imo, they fit the whole &quot;scourge theme&quot; very well. DK is, well... plate armor, could be any other set/quest reward. Let's see if the helm will make up for this.<br />
<br />
When will we see the other sets??!ßß!? (I know, I know, just kidding ;) ...)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, the Plate Sets are ok, but the Druid ones just don't fit in my picture of a druid for example. <br />
And that's the problem with quite a few Sets. Think about that ridicolous Set with the Eyes all over, i think it was Hunter Set. <br />
I see what the Sets were designed with in mind, but it just doesn't fit in my picture of some classes.</div></div><hr />

I'm a tad disappointed that the general theme of the sets looks like the Ulduar sets but I guess that's what you get when the same team works on many tiers.<br />
The rouge set is brilliant. Geist themed! Awesome! I've always loved the Leaper. Now I can look like him!</div></div><hr />

T8 warriors had a ram on their shoulders, now they get a hog. I'm guessing thats because these animals are supposed to be sturdy like a warrior.</div></div><hr />

Druid = The face is a bit odd, but I like it overall.<br />

Warrior = Very nice. Like it all around. Though my first thought on seeing the red one was Sark from Tron.<br />

Raise graphic settings (High res textures). Works only if higher res textures exist, iirc only for T8+ armor sets.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
&quot;War pigs are pigs said to have been used - at most, rarely - in ancient warfare as a countermeasure to war elephants.<br />
<br />
Pliny the Elder reported that &quot;elephants are scared by the smallest squeal of the hog&quot;.[1] The Romans would later use the squeals of pigs to frighten Pyrrhus' elephants.[2] Procopius, in book VIII of his History of the Wars, records the defenders of Edessa using a pig suspended from the walls to frighten away Khosrau's siege elephants.<br />
<br />
While the above use of pigs in war is plausible, another historical reference - incendiary pigs or fire pigs - is much less so. Aelian reported that Antipater's siege of Megara during the Wars of the Diadochi was broken when the Megarians poured oil on a herd of pigs, set them alight, and drove them towards the enemy's massed war elephants. The elephants bolted in terror from the flaming squealing pigs often killing great numbers of the army the elephant was part of.[3]<br />

Overall the sets are a huge improvement over the load of crap we got served in ToC, Especially the dark red warrior set looks really good. <br />
As for the hunter set, it doesnt give a good first impression, but once you notice that the helm is made to mimic a crypt lord, it does look a good deal better,<br />

I was really disappointed about the preview pics from Blizzard, they made the sets uglier then they are and would have get even more FAIL!-Threats if not you show us the sets in acceptable quality ;)<br />
<br />
So the Rogue is really awesome, I think it will split the poeple similar like the t8 ulduar set with its mask. The first time I'm really sad abput my non-existing rogue :-\<br />
<br />
Warrior looks also great, finally a 3D plate belt (and in your pic at least sharp). I wonder why blizz seems to connect the warrior sets with animals?<br />
<br />
DK looks not that impressive, but I think the helm will make it. The red-greenish remembers me for some sunwell set... and the blue is too similar with the starter gear imo.<br />
<br />
Druid and Hunter is still disappointing me al bit. Hunter looks like an unimpressing wooden guy with t7 shoulders. Irritating with Druid previwe everytime is the human shape, don't know if it's the only reason it looks not so good to me. Shoulders and helmet are ok, but the rest is the same like every time, imo. The same blocky gloves and the same muted colours like last set(s), green violett and brown. Very boring.<br />
<br />
So now I'm waiting for Priests! And of course WL :D<br />

^ That. Although, this time, Blizz is taking the whole 'armor based on raid' thing REALLY far. They are literally designing the entire set based off a mob you will fight. I don't 'think' I've ever seen a full armor set modeled to make you look like a mob. Which in it's own way is pretty cool, imo. :)<br />
<br />
Can't wait to see the Pally one. They probably designed ours to make us look like pink ponies or something. <br />

Unless I'm mistaken, Tier pieces are class specific.<br />

You can get the off set pieces like the belt and boots, but everything else belongs to rogues only.</div></div><hr />

Anyway, I think the rogue set is kickass. I love the warrior set, like the hunter and druid sets.<br />
<br />
I loathe the DK set. It looks like they accidentally put the wrong shoulder model on on side. It's so bad that if I was a DK I would want to reroll to save myself from looking horrid.<br />

<br />
A feral druid will still be able to get the rogue-looking set.<br />
<br />
Typically in every tier, the offset items are chosen based off some specific class. Leather melee DPS items are all designed (skinned/textured) from rogues, caster DPS from mages, etc.<br />
<br />
So, I believe they are saying they will likely be able to get the whole 'set' due to the non-set items (bought with badges such as helms, etc) and the drops (since the instance has so many bosses it is likely you can find a drop for every slot that is off-set) that they can in turn look like a fully decked out rogue.</div></div><hr />

Overall, the style of the T10 armor is looking very good. <br />
<br />
I LOVE the rogue set. Makes the rogue look like a psycho serial killer construct from Silent Hill. <br />
<br />
Though... I kinda think the overstated rhino horn on the hunter helm looks silly. It's like the hunter is overcompensating for something that's, er, not quite so large... Lol. Maybe it would look better if it was a full closed helm.</div></div><hr />

Really? I think T10 resembles Arthas' armor moreso than the T8. Just look at the shoulders (Same skull-on-one-side-spikes-on-the-other theme), the belt (More correctly located on the body and correctly sized) and the boots (Pretty much the same as the belt part. Plus iirc the T10 boots has some form of skull thingy on the boots, like Arthas). The only thing the T8 has in common with Arthas' armor is the theme. <br />
<br />
Now, I wouldn't say it's the same as Arthas' armor, but it's definitively based on it.</div></div><hr />

Think he wants us to see something else than just the shoulders.<br />
<br />
It's funny though. Many sets that have been ingame would've looked better without shoulders at all. I think they're in a too big role in many sets and Blizzard should at times make the shoulders of especially non-plate users small and not very noticeable.</div></div><hr />

Yes, they took over the &quot;theme&quot; of some small points. But that's all. It's like calling humans and dogs identical because they all have 4 extremities, 1 torso, a head, 2 genders with resembling reproductive organs, etc.<br />
<br />
Maybe they had the &quot;theme&quot; in mind, but the differences make them actually look very different to me.<br />
<br />
edit: <br />

Yeah, Chain Armor replaced by Plate and Scales, all Leather and fur gone. Gloves totally different, legs totally different, chest totally different and if you take a closer look even the shoulders are in fact totally different. And of course the ridiculous shiny colors. When has Arthas fallen into a paint bucket? They really look alike a lot. Like a VW Beetle and a Tank.</div></div><hr />

On the sets thou..<br />
Druid- Bit weird with the maws on the shoulders, but good to skip the flower theme.<br />
Hunter- No use beating dead horse. Ugly.<br />
Deathknight- Lame. One shoulder from warrior t3, other one from ToC Horde plate set.<br />
Warrior- The only perfect match. Quite good job there imho.<br />
Rogue- Doesn't makes any sense with that helm, the style of shoulders is quite cool and poison looking thou.</div></div><hr />

Warrior and Rogues sets are great in my opinion. Lots of detail, and they fit the theme well.<br />
<br />
The top half of the Druid set is cool, but the lower robe is pretty bland.<br />
<br />
I would hazard to guess that the hunter set isn't done -- the boots are blander than the rest of the outfit. I think if they included a chinstrap or something the helm would be fine -- just seems too open right now. But below the shoulder it just seems very bland.</div></div><hr />

Most obviously the rogue set goes with geists, hunter is clearly modeled on nerubians, the deathknight set follows the same pattern as Arthas's own set (skull/face on one shoulder, spikes on the other), warriors look a lot like Vrykul (King Ymiron helm). I can't really put my finger on where the druid set comes from, but I wouldn't be surprised if there ends up being a mob type that it mimics in a way.</div></div><hr />

Hunter - seem to've gained the warrior T2 hat, which was always hideous, but I don't entirely dislike it. Will, in my opinion look much better off a human.<br />

Rogue - another hilarious hat. Rest of the set looks nice, but oh god the hat.<br />

<br />
you must be blind. it is clearly based upon Artha's armor.<br />
<br />
<br />
I concur, it's based off of Arthas's armor.<br />
Just because there's skulls on T10 and T8 means they resemble eachother? Arthas has skulls too. All the DK sets have skulls. I've taken the time to circle and label each similarity because I have no life in the mornings.<br />
<br />

<br />
1. left shoulder - Arthas: spikes - T10: spikes - T8: skull thing with horns<br />
2. chest - Arthas: strap - T10: strap - T8: nothing<br />
3. right shoulder - Arthas: smooth skull (can't see it) - T10: smooth skull - T8: skull thing with horns<br />
4. waist - Arthas: skull belt, unique model - T10: skull belt, no horns (similar design, no unique model) - T8: skull belt with horns (no unique model)<br />
5. knee - Arthas: spike on skull, unique model - T10: triangle on the skull (if unique model, would look like Arthas's) - T8: no design, just a skull<br />
6. toes - Arthas: skull with spikes - T10: skull, no spikes - T8: nothing<br />
<br />
Forgot to lable the shoulder design by the chest (on either side of 2.) - skulls on Arthas and T10, nothing on T8.<br />
<br />
<br />
It more closely resembles Arthas's armor. It has it's own design, though, thankfully. It does not resemble T8, except for skulls and being plate.</div></div><hr />

But that's all. It's like calling humans and dogs identical because they all have 4 extremities, 1 torso, a head, 2 genders with resembling reproductive organs, etc.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
You're looking at this wrong. It's nothing like calling humans and dogs identical because of the reasons given. If you follow my logic and apply it to your retort, then the dogs head must look like our head, their torso look like our torso and so on and so forth. They don't.<br />
<br />
Our head does not have a snout. Dogs have.<br />
Arthas' shoulders does not have horns. T8 does. <br />
Arthas' armor does not have a skull with horns resembling a dead Diablo on it's stomach. T8 does.<br />
<br />
However, Arthas' shoulders has a skull on one side and spikes on the other. So does T10.<br />
Arthas' armor has a skull (Human-ish) on its belt buckle-area. So does T10.</div></div><hr />

It's not going to be... because the DK starter set is also the same model as some offset Naxx armor.<br />

Well, I mentioned the differences between Arthas and T 10 above: <br />
<br />
Chain Armor replaced by Plate and Scales, all Leather and fur gone. Gloves totally different, legs totally different, chest totally different and if you take a closer look even the shoulders are in fact totally different. And of course the ridiculous shiny colors. When has Arthas fallen into a paint bucket? They really look alike a lot. Like a VW Beetle and a Tank.<br />
<br />
And I will stick to this comparison.<br />
<br />
It more closely resembles Arthas's armor. It has it's own design, though, thankfully. It does not resemble T8, except for skulls and being plate.<br />
So you have two red cars and a tank. If you look closely you are able to find resemblances between the one car and the Tank. However you deduce from this that the car resembles the tank more than the other car.<br />
You take the small similarities, maybe 10%, and conclude that T10 looks more like the LK-Armor, ignoring the rest 90%.<br />
It is no small point that chain is replaced by plate, that leather is replaced by plate, that T8 and T10 share the same colors, that pretty much everything but some tiny resemblances you managed to find is different.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying that I would want T10 to look exactly like the LK-Armor, in fact it's the opposite, I would be much happier if they did some innovative things with it just like with the other classes, I just don't agree with people who say &quot;DKs are getting the LK-Armor&quot; because this obviously isn't anywhere near true.</div></div><hr />

Hunter helm reminds me of Cryptstalker. Only difference is that giant, awkward horn on the head, which makes it look a little more like &quot;Crypt Lord Stalker&quot; or whatever. Since that's what all the Anub-bosses have. A giant awkward horn on their head.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
While I admire your resilience in the subject, I still think you're wrong. All the points mentioned pro-Arthas=T10 are points heavily weighted when it comes to the armor designed Blizzard makes. All the parts that sort of stick out. <br />
<br />
Getting tired of analogs, but here goes:<br />
<br />
We have cars A and B with identical flames painted on, while car C has lightning. Car A and C are black, while car B is gray. Which ones are more alike?<br />
<br />
I know, this is a relatively bad analog, but I'm tired, and I'm pretty sure it conveys my point to a degree where most people can see it.. :P<br />
<br />
If you're still going to argue about this, I think I'll have give you a troll-stamp and ignore it, because it's pretty obvious where T10 comes from.</div></div><hr />

Don't start calling ad hominem when it has yet to occur.<br />
<br />
<br />
Try: car1, car2, SUV<br />
<br />
Let's say car1 is a Smart car, car2 is a Taurus, and car3 is a 4Runner.<br />
<br />
The theme: they're all vehicles, and none of them are the same (as opposed to your analogy of &quot;red car 1, red car 2, tank; you think red car 2 = tank&quot;)<br />
<br />
Which does car2 look like more?<br />
<br />
Well, it's not a 2-person squat-nosed, fuel-efficient vehicle, that looks like it'll crumple at the slightest breeze.<br />
But it's also not a large 5-seater with lots of cargo space and a spare tire in back.<br />
However, car2 and SUV are both aesthetically pleasing, are &quot;big&quot; by certain standards, neither are nearly as efficient of fuel economy, and even though the Smart car has the highest crash rating out of all three of them (another reason why car2 and SUV are more alike), car2 and SUV still look like they can actually take damage. The makes of car2 and SUV have also been established for much longer.<br />
<br />
What you say is 10% is actually 80% of what the player sees. You're right, there's no more mail, and the only &quot;leather&quot; is the strap across the chest. There is still fur.<br />
<br />
And time for some ad hominem!_________________________________________________<br />
If you can't see how your analogies are irrational and irrelevant, then there's no helping you. Yours: A != A ~ C; Mine: A ~ B != C<br />
<br />
To you, everyone's disregarding the differences. To everyone else, you're disregarding the similarities. To you, the differences between Arthas and T10 make T10 and T8 more alike... when it's the differences between T8 and T10, differences between T8 and Arthas's, the similarities between Arthas's and T10 and the lack thereof between T10 and T8 that make T10 and Arthas's more alike. [/redundancy]<br />
<br />
It's obvious there's no changing your mind, though. So I've either been successfully trolled, or you're dumb. Either way, I'm a fool for proceeding with this._________________________________________________<br />

<br />
<br />
You better be joking. T9 for druid is the worse looks ever, unless you are a horde player. <br />
<br />
You have to think dead or evil looks. We are going inside ICC and getting gear from undead mobs. <br />
<br />
I love the new looks, it does not have that resto druid feel to it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ahm... I'm not seeing a &quot;neck brace&quot; thing in either one of those images. Could you mark it? Cuz all I'm seeing is where the chest texture ends at the neck (although difficult to spot for the DK skin in Blizzard's image).<br />

But we do get 1 color right?<br />
In previews we always see more colors than there are ingame?<br />
<br />
<br />
the reason is that 2 of the colors are used for the tier set and then the other 1 or 2 colors are just armors that have the same skin with different colors and thats how it would look if all the different pieces of armor were put together</div></div><hr />

<br />
I LOOOOOVE the new armor. DK is sorta tame, but I love the different shoulder pieces. Warrior looks just awesome, and the Rogue also looks freakin great. But it seems I don't share the &quot;mainstream&quot; taste but it seems Blizzard has a similar taste, so why should I care? ^^<br />
<br />
The Rogue looks totally creepy, it's great, I don't get why people bitch about it. Because it's not &quot;beautiful&quot;, or &quot;EVil&quot;? My god....<br />
<br />
I'm really looking forward to the mage though, I hope we get something similar to the gear of the San'layan.<br />
<br />
I loved Tier 8, especially Mage and Rogue, the sets most people hated. I also love T10 Rogue, so I hope I'll love T10 Mage again as well.<br />

Actually blizzard is giving tips about Arthas and the Emerald Nightmare for a long time. It seems like he found out about it and the rest is pure speculation.<br />
We even got a captured Green Dragon in icecrown.</div></div><hr />

Rogue tier 10 won't drop from bosses or bought with badges, instead it now has a 0.01% drop chance while skinning Geists.<br />
