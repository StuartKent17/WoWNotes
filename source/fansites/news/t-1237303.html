Ghostcrawler Interview<br />
Today's interview is with Ghostcrawler on Wowjuju (http://www.wowjuju.com/_/wowarticles/exclusive-interview-with-greg-street-r277). A summary of the main points is below, but reading the full interview is worth it if you want to see the full answers!<br />

<br />
Future patches will keep the number of daily quests added more reasonable, similar to the amount added in Patch 5.1.<br />
Having a queue and audience for the Brawler's Guild makes it more exciting; it isn't something that you are supposed to rush through. You get priority in the queue if you haven't done a battle yet for the day as well.<br />
Unless you are one of the higher end raiders, you may not feel that upgrading all of your gear is worth the effort, and that is okay. Upgrading is another way to provide progression throughout the expansion. <br />
The 10 / 25 man changes in Asia aren't a test for the US / EU realms, just a response to what players there want. No one wants to see 25 player raiding disappear though. <br />
Main-hand and off-hand items will be allowed to be transmogrified with each other, as well as any weapons that use the same animation. Things like staves and polearms, the one handed axes, maces and swords, and the two handed axes, maces and swords. <br />
Golden Lotus being required for other reputations was a way to reduce the amount of daily quests that were initially available to players. <br />
Horde racials are likely better than Alliance racials for PvE right now. Only the top guilds have switched for the racials, but if more guilds do so then the racials will be adjusted. <br />
Players can expect for Wrathion to call upon them during every patch in this expansion in return for increasingly more powerful rewards.<br />

PvP CC Feedback<br />
First things first, I want to make sure you’re aware that the information below reflects both short and long-term design considerations on our end. This isn’t all on the table for patch 5.2 for a number of reasons.<br />
<br />
To make this clear right off the bat: This shift of instant casts back to cast times is not just targeted at crowd control. We also wish to start moving some heals back to having a cast time rather than being instant. That said, we’re not necessarily planning on overhauling many of the spells and abilities that have been instant for a long time now, such as Hand of Justice. We’re looking at some of the big outliers that we see brought up a lot, which are instant-cast, area-of-effect abilities like Blinding Light, or Presence of Mind in combination with Ring of Frost. <br />
<br />
We think that there are too many of these AoE CC spells at this time, especially instant AoE CC, which can create some frustrating gameplay experiences. Some other particular crowd-control effects that are on our radar are abilities like Blood Fear, which we’re considering redesigning altogether, and Predatory Swiftness in combination with Cyclone, which feels virtually impossible to counter.<br />
<br />
While we are talking about cc what about having some more spells share DR with each other. A pala can repentance/blinding light/ hammer. No Dr at all. Why is it that fear and blind share a DR and polly/fear and cycone dont? and many more examples like this. <br />
We’re looking at diminishing returns for CC right now as a possible way to help with CC in PvP combat, but it’s the type of gameplay overhaul that can be risky to implement in the middle of an expansion cycle if the change is too drastic. We are, however, taking a look right now at the DRs within particular classes, as well as special snowflakes like Cyclone. Either way, the design discussion will undoubtedly continue! (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/247647-world-of-stuncraft-why-didnt-deathwing-kill-us/) / Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/6133773365?page=6#108))<br />

Pandaria Pet Battle Daily Quest Bug<br />
If you’re encountering issues with obtaining the Pandaria Pet Battle dailies, the Grand Master Aki quest chain, or the Pandaren Spirit Tamer quest (started by Sara Finkleswith for the Alliance or Gentle San for the Horde), there is a workaround that we’ve had some success with. <br />
<br />
Abandon all Pet Battle related quests and restart the Pet Tamer quest chain from the beginning (Audrey Burhep for the Alliance in Stormwind or Varzok for the Horde in Orgrimmar). This issue could be caused by making Pet Battle quest progress on multiple characters at the same time, and so we strongly recommend sticking with one character until the end to try to avoid encountering the issue again. <br />
<br />
We realize the workaround isn’t ideal, and we’re continuing to investigate the cause. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/247841-blocked-in-pandaria/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/7320422534?page=1#8))<br />

Blue Tweets<br />
PvE<br />
How can we expect ilvl upgrading to affect the tuning of future raid tiers?<br />
Philosophically we want raids to be more about progression and less about instant catch up. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/274003101369892864))<br />
Going back to the old model where you have to progress linear through the raids from release of current expac?<br />
That's the plan. We have older Raid Finder tiers now to provide the necessary gear. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/274016574480990209))<br />
<br />
Appreciate Lesser Charms move 2 currency but 5.1 has filled that bag slot w Commndtions. Any chance they move to currency too?<br />
We wanted you to be able to loot them from players, which currency can't do yet. In the future we should be able to. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/274177335874424833))<br />
<br />
What about people that want to raid but don't want to deal with dailies? Add other ways to get charms pls.<br />
You can raid without charms. You will gear up faster with charms, which seems fine: you can choose to play more or less. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/273165615437582337))<br />
<br />
Using multiple charms on the same boss per week in lfr (by repeated q'ing) intended or bug? Same chance every time?<br />
we're fine with it. You'll eventually run out of charms. Same chance every time. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/273170572186374144))<br />
Will that also worlk on world bosses like Sha of Anger and Galleon?<br />
Not on Sha. When we made him spawn regularly, we didn't think infinite Charms made sense any longer. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/273610177939398657))<br />
<br />
Haven't killed Galloen yet on my server. Horde camp, etc. GMs considered a month-long guild summoning quest or the like?<br />
G is supposed to be the rare boss that not everyone gets. We learned a lot from him and have changes planned for future bosses. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/272796979032109056))<br />
<br />
What's the limit for players inviting other players in brawlers guild?<br />
I believe we started with 1 invite once you reach high rank. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/272066607155658753))<br />
<br />
Does WoW really need obscure glancing blows and crit supression mechanic? It seems really outdated like resists.<br />
Yeah I could see an argument to phase those out. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/271389638273413120))<br />
<br />
How come we dont have the random fight in the Jade Temple anymore? The scroll of strife and peril. I miss the alternative boss<br />
It had bugs we couldn't solve. We hope to bring it back. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/269498391447355392))<br />
<br />
Dont forget to offer alternatives to charms too. Otherwise it would not make sense since dailies would still be required<br />
It's called &quot;bonus roll&quot; for a reason. You don't need it. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/270636384467951617))<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
Do you have a stance on people queuing several groups for a random BG and using timing to ensure they end up together?<br />
You mean using a premade to stomp noobs? What do you think? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/273996272371896320))<br />
<br />
Does Blizzard have plans to clean up CC a little? Getting stunned, feared, again and again can get a bit frustrating.<br />
Most people don't want their CC nerfed, just the other guy. DRs might be a place to look though. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/274018280811929600))<br />
How would you feel about a bar that fills up and once its full you cant CC that player until its empty?<br />
That's kind of like having one DR (maybe with more variation than just 50%) but we've considered it. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/274022640140816384))<br />
<br />
in the future, any plans for total revamp of pvp? i.e. get rid of arena/RBG(in current form) and implement new pvp structure?<br />
We rarely scrap features and start over. We usually iterate towards what are (we hope!) stronger designs. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/273165842651439104))<br />
<br />
The &quot;PVE vs. PVP issue&quot; is frequently misunderstood and over exaggerated. A balance scapegoat.<br />
Agree. Players would still be mad if we didn't change X, but they wouldn't have a reason for why we didn't change X. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/273179305591328768))<br />
<br />
Idea was: skills remain the same in both contexts; only changes in metrics are isolated. + Less testing. <br />
We do that though. Look at PvP Power, CC durations, the healing debuff, etc. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/273187728567459840))<br />
<br />
Very well said, this game should be about constant steady pressure and healing, not burst.<br />
well, burst should be a strategy too, but not the only strategy. PvP is more interesting, we think, when matches vary. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/273169439917215744))<br />

Well, by now, people should have all the 5.0 factions at exalted, the krasarang faction at least half the way to exalted. By the time 5.2 comes, you won't have any charms unless you farm them over exalted...</div></div><hr />

<br />
So they can make more money off the transfer back, haha. Should just let us pick our racials or find some other solution that would keep the majority of players happy. I know I'm in the same boat with a lot of other heroic raiding Alliance playing Worgen that dislike how they look in transmog or mounts are too small. Or just how female Worgen all look the same.

Oh yes, the only thing I like about my female worgen is the sound it makes when killed. It isn't exactly bad for progression as you get to hear it a lot. I hate that no helm looks good on it though. I'd love to play something else (say night elf), but the racials are too good to pass now (or nelf racials are just useless). Coming from rogue PoV, but it's true for most DPS classes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's a shame. Lesser Charms would are exactly the kind of reward they should add to scenarios to actually make them worth doing, especially for players who are done with dailies or simply don't like doing them. Dailies offer rep, valor rewards, mounts, and charms. Another source for charms won't invalidate dailies entirely.</div></div><hr />

Yeah because nobody in NA/EU wants that model to return, right?<br />
<br />
What a ridiculous argument. Forums have been flooding with requests to go back to the WotLK style of separating 10 and 25 since Cata was released, but obviously we don't want it enough somehow..?<br />
<br />
Well .... it is so, because Blizzard cannot be so easily accused in western regions compared to asian regions. <br />
If the id separation will be introduced again you will see that more and more 25 raids are coming back again .... espacialy if the loot is slightly better then in 10 man raid.</div></div><hr />

Oh, and I really hope that seperate 10-man and 25-man lockouts NEVER return. NOTHING was as much fun as feeling that you were raiding the inferior content due to the gear difference and drops difference and meta differences.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Now, the problem still remains that there perhaps needs some additional incentives to perhaps boost more people running 25's as a preference (which will be hard because the sheer number of 10's that are steady now), but one idea is they could share the same gear level/stats, but have 10/25's have a different look/colour, so there isn't a need to run 25's for the better gear, but shows you are running 25's because you have the distinctive gear?<br />
<br />
Another thing, back in wrath I was raiding as a 10, but after we had done our weekly 10 man run, we used to run 25's with another guild which we were fairly friendly with (plus some pugs) and had a crack at the 25 man raid. It was good fun, brought the server a bit more together because trade was always alive with 25man pugs looking to go anywhere and everywhere!</div></div><hr />

I think when they added new pets into old raid content they changed some of that content to make it easier to solo but apparently the nerf to the melee damage of monsters was too low so they are changing it back. Could be wrong but I think that is how it is</div></div><hr />

<br />
But choice without direction is a design faux pas.<br />
<br />
Let's be objective, instead of calling a lot of players &quot;too stupid&quot;, and argue that Blizzard could have improved the current situation by providing better direction of progression and time commitments given the slew of choices; how would you feel if I agreed with you, that choice is good, but that Blizzard failed to give those players direction with their choices?<br />
<br />
I wholeheartedly agree with you though, and so do GC's latest comments, but let's not forget that Blizzard are responsible (from a design point of view) to communicate direction -and direction is what provides players with a sense of priority.</div></div><hr />

hey man. It's all optional right.... 10/25s, dailies. IT'S ALL OPTIONAL. You can play less who cares?

Exactly, the axe swings both ways. Just because you feel &quot;inferior&quot; doesn't mean you get to ruin the fun for other people.

Nothing is shoved down you throat. It IS optional. Just having the dailies there doesn't mean you have to do them. Not in the slightest. If you think them being available means you MUST do them, its probably because you are OCD and neurotic.<br />
<br />
I also assume this is about the &quot;bonus rolls&quot; from charms. Again, optional. You can get loot without them, but if you want bonus rolls, do the work. You can do 7 dailies a day for a week, and have enough to get the 3 bonus rolls.</div></div><hr />

Fantastic. I mean I don't agree but you people seem hellbent to stick to the literal and strict meanings of the words &quot;forced&quot; and &quot;optional&quot; so theirs no reasoning with you on that front. But let's say I agree with your premise (which I don't). So why can't I have 10 and 25s on a seperate lock out then? Why did it have to be changed? Why do some people feel forced to have to do 2 raids but then feel perfectly alright in telling others hey man dailies are totally optional? Why is one type of content more or less forced than the others? For that matter why isn't LFR a part of this discussion? PEople feel forced to do lfr, why isn't lfr a shared lockout with regular raids? Or is LFR totally optional to? If lfr is totally optional then I would submit the change to single 10/25 lockout is no longer needed because we now operate in this whole hey man it's optional paradigm.<br />

Whether 10/25 mans share lockouts, they are both optional. Dailies are optional. Charms are optional. It made me cringe when whiners would say &quot;omg these dailies r so long, i hav to kil 12 mogu omg omg omg&quot; ... Seriously? Then don't do them...<br />

<br />
The issue isn't either the dailies or the raids. The developers steadfastly refuse to change this even given their new mentality. They are one and the same at it's core. If the developers are serious about investing time in the game as a means for reward, if they are serious about the mentality that you should be rewarded for the time you invest in the game then I see no reason why the lockouts need to be shared. <br />
<br />
The contradiction isn't you. The contradiction is the developers. It's not a fucking strawman to compare them because at it's core the issue isn't the type of content, it's the developer mentality that is massively contradictory. They've done nothing but remove barriers to entry over the years, they've done nothing but make the game progressively more and more friendly for players. Now come to find apparently they have a total mind reversal about these things but can't see the total contradiction in leaving raid lock outs as they are.<br />

<br />
Again, you assume way too much. All it does is make you look stupid, and crap all over any points you may make. It was my prerogative to hang out at my buddies place over a long holiday weekend, buy lots of beer and pizza, and level some toons. Anyone could have done that. Buts its ridiculous that it was THAT streamlined. The SHORTEST and EASIEST part of that process was going from 85 in greens to 85 in mostly purples from the HoT &quot;heroics.&quot; Its really not abuse when it was made that way by whining casuals. If you want to unsub because you actually have to spend time leveling and getting gear and generally learning your toons, great. It sucks seeing people in random dungeons that can barely play anyway.<br />
<br />
Again, its a strawman. The comparison is totally ridiculous, and is reaching way too far. Dailies+Charms have almost nothing in common with 10/25 lockouts. Either way, its a crappy argument. It IS optional to do dailies. You can get purples without them. It IS optional to EARN charms. You can get purples without them. raiding 10's or 25's IS optional, regardless of having a lockout.<br />
<br />
In my opinion there should be a standard amount of maximum players per raid. I liked how Kara needed 10 as a starter raid, and the rest were 25's. Something like this should be implemented. That was off topic but I thought it should be mentioned. Again, just because you think their attitude between these two separate issues, does not mean you can argue them against each other.</div></div><hr />

If the developers are serious about investing time in the game as a means for reward, if they are serious about the mentality that you should be rewarded for the time you invest in the game then I see no reason why the lockouts need to be shared. <br />
<br />
<br />
The main issue with raid lockouts is the loot. It has little to do with invested time, or how much Blizzard thinks you should be playing the game or any of that. Shared lockouts were pretty much required as soon as they made 10s and 25s share a loot table. Otherwise, people would gear up faster than Blizzard wants, because you would get multiple chances (with the coin system up to 4) at a given boss's loot table per week. Any adjustments on the drop rates of loot to compensate for this would increase the perception that running both formats is a requirement instead of an option. <br />
<br />
Blizzard does have the tech necessary to make a player only eligible for loot from a boss once a week, like in LFR, but how many people would honestly run a raid a second time in another format knowing that they are getting no loot? I would guess not many.<br />
<br />
The most obvious solution would be to go back to 10s dropping inferior loot. This would kill the majority of 10-mans, as players would now feel that it is &quot;required&quot; for them to run 25s, whether they want to or not, just for the sake of character power as happened in Wrath. Kinda like how they think that dailies are required in the same non-literal sense. This would destroy a ton of guilds/raid teams that are established in the 10-man format, which in the US/EU is by far the more popular format. Asia may be different, but I don't have data on that region. If they were going to go that route, it would probably been seen as better to just switch to a 15-man format only. Same painful aftermath, but with more benefits.<br />
<br />
So solve all those issues and we could have a perfect multi-format raid system. The current setup is nothing more than Blizzard choosing, in their mind, the lesser of the evils. They really can only end these issues by choosing a single format, regardless of what the final raid size would be, and only developing for that format.</div></div><hr />

Seeing as to the fact that at this point 10 an 25 are relatively close in difficulty, with the one that is actually more challenging being decided on an encounter by encounter basis, the only people truly effected by the logistics of 25-man raiding are the officers and raid leads that manage them, thus they are the only ones who could make a claim towards unfair reward. To separate lockouts and increase the reward of 25 man raiding would be rewarding 20 people for a perceived difficulty that they themselves do not feel or suffer through, as actual encounter difficulty is too subjective to base rewards off of.</div></div><hr />

My main got into DS normals the old way, doing all the heroics asap, then raids etc..... <br />
<br />
Then End Time, Hour of Twilight, and Well of Eternity come out... uhhh you can level to 85, hold some BOE loot, get carried in those new heroics and BOOM you caught up to your first toon within days. Me and a buddy cracked out, leveled toons from 1-85, grabbed some BOE's and were almost as geared as our mains in THREE DAYS. THAT is ridiculous.<br />
<br />
I agree. I prefer the MOP design as well, but if it is like BC, it could seriously backfire if people who start playing in, let's say, 5.3 need to do MSV/HOF/Terrace/whateverthe5.2raidisnamed to be able to jump into Siege of Orgrimmar.<br />
<br />
I think, however, that they will implement a slight catch-up mechanic based on a token that drops every time you kill a boss and which will be used to purchase gear (kinda like badges of justice in LK) so that you're not perma-stuck in old tiers of LFR. But yeah, chance is we won't see 5.3 5-mans dropping epics on par with 5.2 raid level.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That is nice for your guild and your server but not everyone has the skilled server population to handle 25m raiding anymore. On my server there is one guild, the one I'm in, that has cleared all content on normal and has any reasonable progression through heroic modes. Everyone else is struggling with normal HoF. Out of the two 10m groups that the guild fields only one has that progression. <br />
<br />
Moving to 25m raiding would mean lowering our standards, getting worse progression, and all for the sake of 8 ilvl. You would essentially force guilds like mine to play with players that we don't want to play with. It is about choice.<br />
<br />
There has to be a way to let people CHOOSE what content that they want to raid, with who they want to raid with, without being penalized for choosing 10m over 25m due to situations outside of their control.</div></div><hr />

I agree that the BC style wasn't perfect, btu I would prefer it over the Cata style. I don't think the BC style was as bad as people look back and remember. If you were in a decent guild running multiple teams it really wasn't a problem. If you don't think your guild can handle that, then maybe you should merge into a bigger guild. The highest geared players were doing TK/SSC?Mags while others were doing Gruuls/Kara...<br />

I just feel like many people want to hit max level on one toon and automatically get max level on all their toons so they won't have to do the work.</div></div><hr />

we're fine with it. You'll eventually run out of charms. Same chance every time. <br />

It seems a lot of GMs are saying you will only get gold on subsequent uses, and yet GC is saying it's the same chance. While I don't think anyone's been able to test the latter, is there anyone who has actually gotten an item off a second use of a charm on the same boss in LFR?

<br />
Again, you assume way too much. All it does is make you look stupid, and crap all over any points you may make. It was my prerogative to hang out at my buddies place over a long holiday weekend, buy lots of beer and pizza, and level some toons. Anyone could have done that. Buts its ridiculous that it was THAT streamlined. The SHORTEST and EASIEST part of that process was going from 85 in greens to 85 in mostly purples from the HoT &quot;heroics.&quot; Its really not abuse when it was made that way by whining casuals. If you want to unsub because you actually have to spend time leveling and getting gear and generally learning your toons, great. It sucks seeing people in random dungeons that can barely play anyway.<br />
<br />
Again, its a strawman. The comparison is totally ridiculous, and is reaching way too far. Dailies+Charms have almost nothing in common with 10/25 lockouts. Either way, its a crappy argument. It IS optional to do dailies. You can get purples without them. It IS optional to EARN charms. You can get purples without them. raiding 10's or 25's IS optional, regardless of having a lockout.<br />
<br />
In my opinion there should be a standard amount of maximum players per raid. I liked how Kara needed 10 as a starter raid, and the rest were 25's. Something like this should be implemented. That was off topic but I thought it should be mentioned. Again, just because you think their attitude between these two separate issues, does not mean you can argue them against each other.<br />
<br />
I'm the one with strawman comparison but you can't see the utter absurdity of comparing end tier cata to first tier of any expac really. They are totally and utterly in contradiction and I don't have to use Dailies as the only example. LFR is an even better example. It gives out easy loot and yet it totally &quot;optional&quot;. It's a second raid cooldown at the same time. Soooo what is it? Why can they make such distinctions without coming out as obvious and total hypocrites?<br />

You don't even know what the cata style is. You compared it to the last tier which has historically almost always been an easier catch up tier. Hell the final tier of tbc added the biggest and easiest catch up mechanic this game has had and made gearing so much faster. Stop comparing the end of one tier to the beginning of another.</div></div><hr />

ORC UNHOLY DeathKnight VS Human UNHOLY DeathKnight<br />
<br />
<br />
ORC <br />
http://wow.zamimg.com/uploads/screenshots/thumb/166257.jpg<br />
ORC Axe Specialization: Expertise with Fist Weapons, Axes and Two-Handed Axes increased by 1%. <br />
<br />
<br />
Lets see here! The end game weapon that has a socket for Sha-touched gem just HAPPENS to be a two-hand Axe &quot; Shin'ka, Execution of Dominion &quot; (http://www.wowhead.com/item=86386) - Thats the End game Strength weapon right there and Humans have no choice BUT to use it. IF Only there was a Sword version of that weapon that also had a Sha-touched socket for a legendary gem , Humans could also benefit from their Sword specialization (http://www.wowhead.com/spell=20597) racial.<br />
<br />
Blood Fury: Melee attack power increased by 4514, Spell power increased by 2257, Lasts 15 secs. 2Min CD. | This one doesn't even require an explanation - An Extra FREE PURE DPS Trinket right there for Orcs! Now Bllizard... why don't you remove one of Human's weapon specializations, either Mace or Sword and give us something JUST AS GOOD ?! Hmmm ?! <br />
<br />
Command: Damage dealt by pets increased by 5%. We know how Unholy death knights are dependent on their pets, 5% FREE Extra damage ?! Anyone ?!! What a Human death knight gets in return ? DIPLOMACY! (http://www.wowhead.com/spell=20599)<br />
<br />

I never said that doing the additional raids would be required. Or that 25s would be required if 10s dropped inferior loot. I only said that some players would (wrongly) feel like they were. Just like they (again wrongly) feel like dailies are required. That's a perception problem on the side of the players, not an inherent problem with the system. Sadly, everyone who has said they are required has further proven that there is a large portion of the population that needs to have their hand held by their babysitter so that they don't needlessly subject themselves to negative things for no other logical reason than because they can. <br />
<br />
It's not conjecture to say that 2 raid formats that share loot but not a lockout means that players have the ability to get gear twice as fast as if the lockout were shared between the two formats. This would lead to players gearing up at a rate that Blizzard is not comfortable with, which is the exact reason they gave before Cata launched as to why the two formats would now share a lockout. Every solution to that problem has it's own negatives attached to it, and nobody has come up with a viable solution that addresses those negatives. Until they do, or until Blizzard dumps the two format raid system and goes with a single raid size for everyone, then we are likely stuck with the system in place now.</div></div><hr />

It was good fun, brought the server a bit more together because trade was always alive with 25man pugs looking to go anywhere and everywhere!10 man = ilevel 200, 25 man = ilevel 213.. <br />
That was the difference. Generally speaking the loot chance in 10 man was higher, yet you've ran both for the doubled chance.<br />
We have that right now too. We get LFR and normal/heroic mode. You can still raid twice, with the perspective of a rather lower and a rather higher quality item.</div></div><hr />

And yet the situation we are in today is PRECISELY what we had during wotlk.

The Battle Fatigue healing reduction debuff has been increased to 30% (was 15%).<br />
<br />
Seriously? Disc is unplayable right now, and the burst is still way over-tuned. How about balancing the classes instead of putting a &quot;blanket&quot; debuff on an entire subset of the population. This &quot;blanket&quot; assumes all healers are created equal, which is just not the case.<br />
<br />
So if burst is too high, why was there no &quot;30% reduction to damage&quot; on all classes. Because it would have been silly.<br />
<br />
Think about the math, balance, and playability before &quot;blanketing&quot; groups Blizzard. This type of balancing is getting absurd.</div></div><hr />

So again the player mentality is incorrect, Blizzard caves to this and makes raids shared lock outs and then instead of caving to this yet again in mists they get behind the position that hey man everything is optional. Does that not strike you as contradictory on their part?<br />
<br />
No, I don't find it contradictory. You are comparing two separate issues, but ignoring the real core problem, or even trying to fix the real problem. Blizzard gave a reason for the shared lock outs. Comparing dailies to doing the same raids twice a week is just silly. With your argument that things are &quot;pretend forced on you,&quot; I could come to the conclusion that Blizzard is contradicting itself by not forcing players to complete raids on heroic before going on to the next tier or raids. Oh wait, that just sounds totally ridiculous, and I am not only reaching to prove a point, but its a horrible strawman. Lets look at the real issue. The casuals complaining and ruining things.<br />
<br />
Now lets think of a real fix. MAKING ONE RAID CONFIGURATION. I never understood why the thought having two was acceptable or even a good idea at all. I know in Vanilla, three raid types were available in the end, and two in BC. But the difference was different raid types were confined to different raids. They should go back to this idea.<br />

Everything else -40<br />

Everything else-25<br />
<br />
Then things got silly and everything was 10/25. It may cause some disruption, but the should set the standard now. Make everything 10 man or 15 or 20 or even 25. I Personally would suggest 10 mans for my experience in the US.</div></div><hr />

God I hope Blizzard embraces your so called &quot;real&quot; problem and totally shoots themselves in the head. Please if your reading this GC or whoever listen to this guy. The faster you do the faster we can get past this nonsense about optional and forced and get back to making rewarding content that doesn't require me to invest my life.</div></div><hr />

Dailies and gating content is lazy and uninspiring to say the least, why not come with top class content instead of shit content that's gated to make it seems like it last longer.</div></div><hr />

What top class content? There is only that many things you can do in an MMO. Dynamic events like in GW2? Perhaps, but at the end of the day it's just another form of quests. If you look at other MMOs, there is nothing revolutionary in any of those.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mmoce8fd318b33</div><div class="date">2012-12-13, 11:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That is nice for your guild and your server but not everyone has the skilled server population to handle 25m raiding anymore. On my server there is one guild, the one I'm in, that has cleared all content on normal and has any reasonable progression through heroic modes. Everyone else is struggling with normal HoF. Out of the two 10m groups that the guild fields only one has that progression. <br />
<br />
Moving to 25m raiding would mean lowering our standards, getting worse progression, and all for the sake of 8 ilvl. You would essentially force guilds like mine to play with players that we don't want to play with. It is about choice.<br />
<br />
There has to be a way to let people CHOOSE what content that they want to raid, with who they want to raid with, without being penalized for choosing 10m over 25m due to situations outside of their control.<br />
<br />
I totally understand where you're coming from, however, I wasn't saying 25's should be run over 10's and if you re-read my post I was saying there shouldn't be a difference in gear between either, but some way of giving some identity to 25's such as different colour gear etc just as an idea.<br />
<br />
I also mentioned that we pugged the 25's with another guild (as we were both not 25 raiding guilds even back then) and it wasn't so much for progression because we were doing the content as 10's, it was because we could and it was fun, and DID bring the server together (still have some friends on the list from those days, good times).<br />

<br />
10 man = ilevel 200, 25 man = ilevel 213.. <br />
That was the difference. Generally speaking the loot chance in 10 man was higher, yet you've ran both for the doubled chance.<br />
We have that right now too. We get LFR and normal/heroic mode. You can still raid twice, with the perspective of a rather lower and a rather higher quality item.<br />
<br />
I know we have LFR, I don't mind that at all, if anything it's a nice addition to the game for many people and I know we can just form up and hit the LFR with the other guys, but again it all comes to choice - do the normal/hc 25 man with a nice settled pug (only a few people changing that would be grabbed from the server in trade) or doing the dumbed down version?!<br />
<br />
I can see the reasons why we have it as it is now, but giving one playerbase the option to have seperate lockouts, and not the rest is quite poor imo.</div></div><hr />

<br />
False. With that thinking, it is required to literally spend all your time playing, so you can farm gold to buy better gear, farm JP/VP to improve gear, make sure you have 1 of every class, and 1 of every profession etc etc etc. Stupid logic.</div></div><hr />

<br />
While I did like being able to run with both a 10man guild group and then a 25 man pug (ok, it was more of a cross-guild batch of friends, but it was fun), I agree that making raids one-size only would make a hell of a lot more sense, especially if they're going to only have one lockout per raid. Personally, I'd say go with the 15 man size. 10 doesn't really feel like raiding to me, it's just a big heroic group.</div></div><hr />
