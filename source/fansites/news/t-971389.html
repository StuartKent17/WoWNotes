There were no blue posts today because of the Labor Day holiday, Blizzard posters will probably be back tomorrow with more news!<br />
<br />
It has been too long since we posted some stats and this time we took a look at how many characters reached Level 85 each day since Cataclysm was released. This only includes data from the US Realms to keep the dates simpler. This does not include all of the level 85 characters in the US, only a sample of 1.1 million. Interested in seeing some other statistics? Let us know in the comments!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
You can see that a very large number of people reached Level 85 in the first week after release, thousands even the first day. <br />
It seems that people enjoy leveling during the weekend with a spike on Saturday and an even larger spike on Sunday. <br />
You can see where Patch 4.1 and Patch 4.2 came out, decreasing the amount of leveling briefly.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">chaud</div><div class="date">2011-09-06, 04:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The most interesting thing about these stats are how few accounts there are in the United States at level 85.<br />
<br />
Purely an estimate, but if there are 7k people hitting 80 per day (on average), and we've had 200 days since launch, that's only 1.4 million level 85 characters.<br />
<br />
If each account has, on average, 2 level 85 characters, then that's only 700k max level accounts.<br />
<br />
Both of those are pretty generous estimates (I'm guessing that the average 85s per account is much higher, and that the 7k people per day is way too high).<br />
<br />
I debated adding it to the post, but this is maybe 1/3rd or less of the level 85 characters in the US.</div></div><hr />

Gah, you should have said that for sure. I looked at that and went &quot;wow, VERY few people play now a days.&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not everyone plays 8 hours a day. The average casual gamer got to 85 1-2 weeks after. Some people might have leveled a worgen/goblin or another class instead of their main first. Or something else entirely. Some people might have not bought the game the second it came out, or could play it the second it came out. Some people didn't even reboot their subscription until a bit after it came out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
no real reason to level different 85s anymore. buffs are provided by multiple classes, hunters, warlocks and shadow priests are literally the same. i eeven use the same keybinds for these characters.</div></div><hr />

<br />
seriously though guys, its from a sample of 1.1 million so what the numbers are really saying is that around 18.5% of all players got to lvl 85 within the first week of cata (203764 from 8th till 15th) and most level on weekends.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I can understand why. Me and my buds didn't hit 85 until the 2nd-4th days. The 1st day or two we were busy leveling our Goblins/Worgen.</div></div><hr />

OH... that's better, if we consider the data consistent, we end reaching the numbers at least 3 times higher for the US region as whole.</div></div><hr />

Who made *that* decision? Though it was probably unavoidable given the very limited number of new zones they were adding - they had to cram 5 quests per 100 yards as it was.<br />

<br />
Yeah, I remember first trying out the new healing/DPS abilities + mechanics and ending up with nearly identical keybinds for every class with a similar role. There were a handful of unique, long-cooldown or rare-use abilities, but multiple classes had nearly identical play styles - the only difference being the animation color.</div></div><hr />

In other words, what is the male/female ratio for all characters whose primary spec is a tanking spec? Healing spec? DPS spec? I do a LOT of random dungeons, and anecdotally, I'd say the vast majority of the tanks I have run with have been male characters. Healers tend to skew toward female, but not to the same degree. I'm curious if the actual data reflect that.I find it fascinating that in a game where we can be any gender we want, we still bring our real-world biases into the game that say protecting a group is still primarily a male's role.</div></div><hr />

The average casual gamer got to 85 1-2 weeks after. Some people might have leveled a worgen/goblin or another class instead of their main first. Or something else entirely. Some people might have not bought the game the second it came out, or could play it the second it came out. Some people didn't even reboot their subscription until a bit after it came out.<br />
<br />
Those comments always make me feel sad. The game isn't that hard mate.<br />
<br />
10 85 cleared RotZ (same alt guild) and 2 in BiS pre-FL raid.<br />
<br />
1 85 horde side 'cause I wanted to see their questlines.<br />

Bailed after the AFK Spamming fiasko and 2 reverted ban and perma ban from their forum for having the guts to bring it to light... may get back once they fix that issue... unless they take the same sweet time they did with melee targeting issue... in that case... see ya in SWTOR.</div></div><hr />

The Dark Legacy ones often only work if you have read them from the start/read them all now from the start.<br />

It parodies some aspects of the game, but from the view point of the small band of characters that the comic revolves around.<br />

Now I'm doing the Molten Front with my Rogue and because of how long it is I don't see myself doing it ever again. All of the toons have a mishmash of 346 heroic blues and ZA/ZG gear with some of my favorite classes: Hunter or Rogue having T11 raid gear. My DK is primarily PVP now since they are OP, I don't really PVP on my rogue anymore since I did for countless hours back in vanilla and seeing all those hard BG achievements I've done multiple times makes me mad.

I had 1 max level from vanilla to BC, then 3 during WoTLK, and because the end-game content bores me immensely in Cata I just find myself leveling alts now.

I suggest reading the full post before posting... This graph is only of 1.1 million 85s in the US. Also the reason there is more on the left than right is because more of those 1.1 million users leveled to 85 closer to the release of the expansion, it has nothing to do with &quot;wow dying&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Cataclysm just isn't as fun. The more unnecessary changes we see, the more this is true.<br />
<br />
For every cool new thing they add, they unnecessarily nerf/change/break something that was fine how it was, and should have been left alone...<br />
<br />
With some missed promises, things never delivered, implied but never got to or changed up.<br />
<br />
I would say my greatest issue with cataclysm right here. For all the fun, new changes we got in classes and for PvP balance we get the shaft on so many other things to go with it, for example:<br />
<br />
Good things:<br />
-PvP health to damage in a better proportion.<br />
<br />
-Some class abilities made more useful<br />
<br />
-PvP talents are more useful<br />
<br />
-Some minor improvements to BGs and arenas<br />
<br />
-Better stat design<br />
<br />
-Triage based healing<br />
<br />
The bad to counter act each note above:<br />
-PvP health, just made healers that much more important (op) than prior, nerfed to the fun and effectiveness of self healing (for classes that had it). PvP still is just more imblanced than it was prior to the changes. Messed up dispel change (again needed to nerf the OP ones only), MS is hardly a secondary effect now, should've just lowered the duration, not the effect.<br />
<br />
-Lost abilities that had flavor and given some more complicated (for no good reason) rotations and ramp up obstacles to achieve decent damage. One example being ghostly strike. Also losing unique abilities (should've been nerfed if too powerful) like heroism and other homogenized garbage, that ruins the minute benefit of diverse classes, instead of stacking.<br />
<br />
-We lost the old number of talents for a tiny cut down portion, that is pretty much oversimplified, no longer getting talents every level, lost some old talents that were useful, and in general more choices, even if they weren't that good.<br />
<br />
-Same old BG concepts, when will we get a deathmatch and other more interactive BGs scenarios, I don't think anybody favors current AV over old(not change but refuse to revert the change), losing skirmish option.<br />
<br />
-More rampant gear inflation and stat inflation now, in 5 levels you gain 5x the health. Gear I-levels jumps insane amounts now.<br />
<br />
-Mana becomes THE issue now, the problem people complained most about in TBC. They could've made the challenge easily be achieving high HPS instead of managing mana, you know kind of like how the DPS do. Regardless it sucks balls when classes just feel nerfed from 80-85, and mana for healers seems like a broken concept at low gear no matter what you do.<br />
<br />
But so many changes/directions people have been asking for forever have still been ignored I will not list them, look long enough hard enough on forums and you will see many great ideas. Things people have wanted like 1v1, just being ABLE to do it, open world PvP not like WG (and TB is pretty much just as lame). PvE and end game is the same horse to be beaten, nothing at all has changed abut it, leveling is easy = gets boring. Non raiding endgame involves a horrid grind of dailies and other boring activities along with getting stomped in PvP before you gear up in order to make what little progression you can.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As a pure casual I have been struggling lately and found myself PVPing as raiding is not really an option (time, guild collapsing, etc). I find myself levelling alts, and as like a number posters above said, &quot;I log on, do nothing 99% of the time, and log off&quot;. <br />
<br />
I must say as a casual, I really miss the Wrath model where Raids were so accessible to everyone (I really enjoyed TOC as there was no trash to kill), heroics that could be face rolled in 20min and completing all the menial/grinding tasks involve no effort. There was incentive to level alts because once you hit 80 you could quite easily jump into a PUG raid and get gear.<br />
<br />
I get all the harcore out there want Raids to be &quot;hard&quot; so they can flex their epeen with achievements and high ilvl gear, but surely the Heroic mode does that for you.<br />
<br />
I don't plan on rage quitting any time soon as overall I still enjoy the game, I just wish I could enjoy a little bit more of it.<br />
<br />
But on topic - levelling alts is sooooooooo painful and in all honestly after going through all the &quot;lore&quot; once, I really don't give a crap the second, third and fourth time and wish i could just create a level 85 char. I just wish we could spend ingame gold and get a BOA &quot;free level&quot; (even if they made it only for previous expansion levels, say 5K per level, that way I could avoid outlands for ever :)).</div></div><hr />

Yeah that's pretty much why I still come to MMO daily. I played WoW from launch until about March this year when I stopped playing because I was having no fun whatsoever. Once upon a time WoW was the greatest game ever made, and I loved playing every minute of it. I saw it all, from MC to the original Naxx 40 (I killed KT back when it meant something), through BC and Sunwell, through WotLK and the awesome Ulduar where I got the server first legendary mace. Basically I had some great times, but now the game absolutely fucking sucks. I'm holding out hope that with the next expansion it could return to former glories, but realistically I know it's not that likely to happen. But I'm an optimist, so here's crossing my fingers.<br />

ToC was free loot, and the badge incrementalism soon made heroic 5 mans irrelevant in terms of difficulty; the gear was so much better than Ulduar so no one ran Ulduar anymore. ICC was 'ok' although fairly repetitive and lasted way too long (1 year). Content became so easy that I ended the expansion with 6 x 85s, all tier 9+ geared. I chased achievements for the last 6 months and ended somewhere around 9000. Cataclysm repeated all the mistakes of Wrath, and made them worse. The Valor cap/justice cap method reduced the reason to logon; each raid tier progressed the badge gear further which exaccerbated the gear incrementalism of Wrath. What's worse, they tried to tier the dungeons -- with recycled content! -- so that people only ran the same 2 troll dungeons over and over... ugh. Its almost as if Blizzard *wanted* their audience to burn out. Lore wise, Cataclysm is just flat... not a fan of the refreshed 1-60 content from what i've seen (especially hrode side), and 80-85 is a 20 hour experience tops. Homogenizing 10 and 25 man raid loot means 25 mans rarely happen now. The Firelands dailies are the worse of all the dailies i've seen so far -- worse than Orgrila, worse than Netherwing, worse than Quel Danas or even ToC. Class mechanics are more proc based, more gimicks (e.g. holy power) added with no benefit, tanks are homogenized and they've arleady backed away from the threat mechanic they tried to bring back.In general, WoW is still WoW... its just less interesting, easier and less challenging, and almost entirely raid focused. If you raid, then the end game is still probably enough to keep you playing. PvP, questing/lore, pve wise? Its got about 30-60 days worth of content tops.</div></div><hr />

I couldn't agree more. That's why for me the greatest run WoW had was from WoTLK launch up to ToC. I still enjoyed ToC but I do think they dragged ICC out too long.</div></div><hr />

<br />
TBC, I had 8 70s - content was awesome, classes varied and interesting, and it was great fun to just get another one to 70 and throw them into Karazhan (that place didn't get old for a LONG time). <br />
<br />
WotLK, 5 80s. Things not quite as fun, but the Northrend levelling was just tedious and horrible, which put me off levelling more. Ulduar was a great instance and definitely a high point in WoW. Heroics became a tedious and horrible grind, but at least quick. The ICC heroics were vaguely interesting. ICC itself dragged on forever and burnt out so many people. The standard of players became gradually worse due to the easymode heroics. <br />
<br />
Cataclysm, 3 85s. One of those just for professions. The levelling isn't as bad, it just seems pointless. Classes are less interesting than they were. Levelling 1-60 is more boring because it feels like it's all handed to you on a plate. I used to love 1-60 dungeon runs, but now those are overly short and stupidly easy. Loads of people quit or just make others lives a misery in heroics because they are &quot;too hard&quot; compared to Wrath (difficulty level is ok, but they are pretty boring). Less effort is spent by Blizz with seemingly every patch. Take the troll patch: the rehashed dungeons were a bad enough idea, but they touted an interesting quest line to go with it! The quest line took 30 minutes tops. Firelands patch: touted an epic Thrall questchain. Worst questchain in the game, supremely boring and finished in under 30 minutes. Firelands dailies are done and dusted in a month, and too repetitive to want to repeat on alts. <br />
<br />
I love WoW as a game. I love the background and the story and the races and the locations. But Blizzard need to get a handle on what they're doing and fix this mess they've allowed the game to slip into. :(</div></div><hr />

They are dailies... You can't get annoyed at Firelands dailies for being repetitive when all dailies are repetitive.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's not necessarily true. For example I never minded the Hodir dailies at all. They were fun and different. Whenever I run an alt through Northerend, I still do those dailies to level up. The problem with the Firelands quests are that they are way too drawn out and the repetitive factor of dailies is multiplied due to the fact that as you unlock &quot;new&quot; quests you still have to do all the old ones, moving across what seems to be three zones, and at the end of the day for rewards that imho don't seem worth it. At least the ToC dailies had vanity items like mounts to keep me going.</div></div><hr />

If you wanted to be spiffy, you could have two graphs, one for normal 5-man heroics and the other for 5-man Trollroics.<br />

I'm not sure if this is possible given as to the unknown limitations of your program, but a guy can hope! This is just me spit balling here, but I'm willing to bet the percentage of completion would be a lot higher than most people would expect.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's why I still come to MMO<br />
<br />
The problem is that we've all been beaten to death with the same MMO formula. In the beginning everything is great, enormous, and immerses you. At least that's how it was for me. I was so enthralled by the game i'd turn down social events on raid nights. Now, it is a completely different story. I don't have the passion or interest in scheduling my events. The only &quot;new&quot; content is the xpacs. You are either all in or casual. Even one night a week eventually becomes a chore when you would rather be doing something else than farming that same raid you've done a zillion times. I've been in hardcore bleeding edge guilds to the casual &quot;couple of friends&quot; guilds.<br />
<br />
The typical pve setup is quests and dungeons to level, hit max cap do more dungeons until you finish them all and get your loot, then advanced versions of dungeons to get better loot. Then raid to get the best loot. And while that formula has worked for a long time, in my opinion it's time for a change. MMO's need to inject more substancial content between dungeons and raids... or find a way to make raids more accessible without having to schedule your life around raid nights. The new looking for raid system in next patch is fail. No standard achievements or loot? You get kiddie rewards, after dealing with a pug?<br />
Some might argue join a casual guild, but my question is: Have you done it? I've found that I get absolutely nothing done. Might as well be playing solo with a large friends list. Even with a small dedicated guild I sat waiting to start a raid for up to 1.5-2 hours sometimes. There is such a delicate balance required to make it work correctly. Yet, to do so it must be structured with rules and penalties and dkp/epgp/attendance tracking and so on. you need enough people to replace those out, yet when they are all present you must have standby's.<br />
<br />
I fully understand that people can blaze through content way faster than it can be created, however there is a certain negative feeling you get when you are paying to play an MMO yet you are unable to do what you want because you are unable to find the people. I don't really get into PvP much, but that's not to say i haven't participated.<br />
I seem to hear a lot of constant discussion about difficulty and balance. To me, this has nothing to do with why i cancelled my sub. The reason? Repetition of the same formula. Sure i logged in a few weeks ago and had a blast running the old ZA and ZG dungeons. I wanted to get all the gear... until i realized that if I let that pull me back in i'm going to be at the same crossroad I was at when i stopped playing - faced with settling for less and not seeing the content, or scheduling my life around raid nights again.<br />
<br />
I think I'll pass. There are too many decent free to play MMOs now and although the formula may work for newer players and PvPers it certainly has lost the appeal to me.<br />
<br />
I come back to MMO sites because as stated before, I am hoping that they change things enough to bring back the enjoyment I once had for this game, and games like it.</div></div><hr />
