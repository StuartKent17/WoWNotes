Since we first announced World of Warcraft Classic, we’ve seen questions about spell batching. While we never really eliminated spell batching in WoW, we did change how (and how often) we process batches of actions coming from players, so you’re less likely to notice that processing in today’s game. We’ve been working to ensure that in WoW Classic, the gameplay of activating spells and effects will not differ from the experience of playing original WoW.<br />
<br />
It was relatively common in the original game to see a warrior Pummel a mage who simultaneously and successfully Polymorphed the warrior. The mage suffered Pummel damage but no spell-school lock, because the mage didn’t get interrupted. This could seem paradoxical, but it could happen because the Pummel and Polymorph were both in the same batch, and were both valid actions at the start of the batch. For the most part, things like that don’t happen in modern WoW, but they still can. We’ve made improvements to batch frequency, and the game is much more responsive than it used to be. Still, if you manage to get both a Pummel and a Polymorph into a tiny processing window in modern WoW, you’ll experience the same behavior as in original WoW.<br />
<br />
As with many other areas of WoW Classic, authenticity is our primary concern. It used to be the norm that combat flow and PvP balance were defined and tuned in a game where spell messages were resolved less frequently. There was a single game loop that processed all messages sent and received every server tick. Nowadays, the game processes multiple loops for messages of differing priorities. Spell casts are high priority, and have been for a long time.<br />
<br />
For WoW Classic, we’re moving spell casts to a low-priority loop that will cause them to be processed at the frequency that best fits how the game actually played in version 1.12. Two mages will be able to Polymorph each other somewhat reliably, resulting in two sheep nervously pacing around at range. Two warriors will be able to Charge one another, and the end result will be both warriors standing stunned in each other’s original location.<br />
<br />
We think it’ll be fun to see those sorts of things happening again.</div></div><hr />

Literally the only thing impacted by the loot trading is not requiring players to make tickets to have loot moved around in raids, which was the norm. Loot trading existed in vanilla, you just needed a GM to do it for you.</div></div><hr />

See my sig, what vanilla means to one person and what vanilla means to another are as different as what brexit means to one brit and what It means to another. <br />

I still have it happen occasionally in current-day WoW, but it certainly was a lot more common to have odd PvP spell resolves in classic. Crazy stuff can happen, especially when it comes to CC's.

People play on those servers because they are FREE. I think you underestimate how much people don't want to pay for things. Why buy the cow when you can get the milk for free? I predict Classic servers will be fucking ghost towns a couple months after launch.</div></div><hr />

Exactly...in fact I'm currently unsubscribed and as of this moment unlikely to buy anymore expansions because systems like Azerite traits and mission tables make me gag..I will, however, be re-subscribing to play Classic and I am looking very much forward to doing that warts and all.<br />
<br />
my only hope is that the Dev team stays strong and doesn't succumb to the whining of all the crybabies that have learned to have everything handed to them and spoiled in the process. Classic Wow is called Classic for a reason. If you want all the QoL improvements of later versions, and the other garbage that goes with it, play retail and leave Classic alone.</div></div><hr />

I've been saying since for ever ago they should have IN GAME polls/surveys (kinda like how a GM ticket will stay on your screen until you take care of it. I always see &quot;the majority of players this and that&quot;, where you getting these numbers from? Have a poll so we can establish factual opinions. That's cool to see a game do that, wish they'd do that in WoW.</div></div><hr />

<br />
umm no? That kind of latency was mostly my side personally(usually 250-300ish). High ms was due to dial up (higher net was avail but I was a child and had no control over my family's fortune and internet) FPS limits also another personal limit. I literally dcd in cities because of how bad my pc was. My dad had to log into my account from his house to get me out of stormwind.<br />

<br />
Which is the exact reason for loot trading. It was done either to sell the items for in game materials for raiding or for straight gold. Quite commonly. Would it make you guys feel better if blizzard programmed a fake GM bot to talk you through the whole thing?</div></div><hr />

wow will never become that super precise high level pvp game. if ppl searching for this they should look at other games, not wow. so why want ppl that wow try to aim at this while just become a static predictable horrible boring shit game instead of a game with funny situations and special moments ?<br />
<br />
i know literally zero persons that say: „omg i remember how i brainlessly killed that 10 completely underwhelming mobs in WoD“ while i know a lot of ppl saying „remembering when we tried to kill that sea giants in STV at lower levels and fought them around 6mins while using all stuff we had and finally killed them? what a nice memory“. <br />
<br />
a game with roughs and curves is way more funny, even when not great designed, than a mindless perfect designed game. why ? because later one is simply fucking boring.</div></div><hr />

Yikes! Talk about the amount of people crying every time the Classic Devs post an announcement. It seems like the Classic Devs are doing a much better job at listening to the playerbase than the retail--and the game isn't even out yet. You people should at least wait until it's released to cry because it will overtake retail in popularity. It'll be like RS3 and OSRS.<br />

I don't think you understand what this means. It has nothing to do with the pacing of combat.<br />
Are you sure? I think it does affect reaction time in PvP, giving a bit more time to react to other player's action.</div></div><hr />

Yes many classes had something that made them &quot;IMBA&quot; in a way. But it also made them special and fun.<br />
Trying to make everything equal made it boring for me.<br />

<br />
Nope; 60 seconds polymorph does not exist in Vanilla WoW; because Polymorph could not go 60 seconds long. Rank 3 Polymorph was the maximum in Vanilla, and that is actually 50 seconds. Only later (bc?) mages got a 1 minute Polymorph.</div></div><hr />

Diminishing returns existed in Vanilla, though. They've said Classic is based on 1.12, and Entangling Roots specifically was made to have diminishing returns in 1.5.</div></div><hr />

Classic will be a big hit, i myself will be joining in on the fun for a while. It's popularity will start to drop after about 3 months. People will see that their nostalgia is juts that, and the game itself is more harsh than they remember. People now whine about short rep grinds.... what the hell are they going to do when the find out how long it used to take to get from 1-60. And no mounts til 40 and then it's just your slow one. Most people dont remember the lack of quality of life. And some like that, and that's totally fine. But as i was saying, youre going to get less and less people playing over time until it plateaus out somewhere around 8-12 months from release.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm not a super lover of classic like some people, but I think you are grossly underestimating how fresh and exciting classic will be for many people in spite of the grinds and changes to the game. <br />
<br />
I think something that people aren't taking into account is the idea that they get to start fresh on a server where everything is brand new. This means that people will have a shot at making an impact on a brand new economy, brand new raiding scene, farming mats, being the first to get gear, etc. This alone is a factor which will be fresh and exciting outside of the desire for a change in gameplay that some people so desperately want. <br />
<br />
I am not vested in the success of classic in any way shape or form, I am just speculating that it will indeed be popular for a variety of reasons. And its popularity will be great even if you love retail. A rising tide raises all ships, and as a community, we should be happy for the success of the game in general.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't know if it can become more popular than Live, but honestly I wouldn't be too surprised if Classic ends up overtaking Live. They are different games entirely at this point. Live is a 3rd person ARPG, built around throwing all content at the player in 2 week batches. It's seasonal play-the-patch at this point. I tried resubbing a month but there is simply no motivation whatsoever. I can get better gear but I overgear everything I want to do within single-digit days at 120. Yeah I can do more dps but what does it matter? It's not like I will actually notice a difference, if a dungeon boss dies in 26 seconds instead of 27. They are still just nameless bosses. I barely even bother to check what they do, it's not like there's any chance of a wipe. <br />
BFA is now quite literally designed around raiders and people who has a stable m+ group. Everything else is just padding and designed to get you there faster. Spend an afternoon at 120 and you're ready to go. For everyone else, who wants a true RPG experience outside of endgame, WoW Classic will be a good alternative. I think a lot of people will be happy just with leveling characters. Why? Because leveling in Classic is actually a satisfying game experience.<br />
<br />
I'm having more fun leveling a lowbie warrior on a private realm than all of BFA. Genuinely getting more enjoyment out of replaying through all of Elwynn Forest and now Westfall than randomly mashing buttons getting gear thrown at me, in a game world where the only way to lose anything is if I go into a raid or high m+.<br />
It's amazing how much more fun it is when you genuinely care about your character. I have time to focus on BS/Mining/First Aid/Cooking (because I'm not leveling up every 10 minutes), I am excited every time I get a gear upgrade (because mobs can easily deal 40-50% of my warriors hp in a 1v1 fight), every level I get have effects, mobs get slightly less threatening, I might get a new ability rank, or maybe a green item in my inventory is useable. Spending a talent, always getting incrementally more powerful.<br />

I did the classic grind already. I loved it and accomplished everything I could have wanted during that era. It was the best version of WoW and the best gaming experience I have ever had. Shit systems like spell batching isn't what made it that, though. The people I played with then didn't have attitudes like you do. If people like you are going to be who's playing the new classic servers maybe it is better I stay away.</div></div><hr />

I do think Classic will be more popular than people think. I really feel there's a large portion of people clamoring for an MMO like vanilla. And some very big streamers who will be playing Classic long term - e.g. Sodapoppin, summit1g just to name a couple - will undoubtedly drive traffic to the game. But by the very nature of Classic being complete I can't see it overtaking retail. Even with the staggered content release plan (which will absolutely need to be on a faster schedule than the original patches as gamers devour content much quicker these days) Classic has a limited shelf life. I mean shit I'm frothing at the mouth for Classic and yet I know I'll only be into it for so long.</div></div><hr />

Yeah a lot of people forget or just don't realize that leveling WAS equally as much as the WoW experience as was anything end game related in classic. It was a thing to actually here someone who was playing for two months say &quot;oh, i'm level 40.&quot; Exploring, running from zone to zone, actually buying gear at level 37 on the AH, extra. You're really spot on with your statement that classic was a good mmoRPG while live is a good raiding game. What excites me the most with classic coming is leveling again. And not feeling that rush that &quot;i have to get to max level&quot; that has been a problem with WoW for a very long time. Being able to run around again and actually having professions while leveling matter, AH while leveling, zones, capital cities outside of SW being useful, the story, not feeling inadequate because after a month MAYBE i'm only level 40, extra is going to be a breathe of fresh air to me. and then after finally getting to 60, a whole other world opens up with amazing dungeons, 5 - 10 mans, raids, 40 mans, bg's, the whole enchilada.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I can only speak from my experience. We raided everything from MC to Naxx, but (very) rarely used a GM to transfer loot, only inside our guild when our guy with master loot did something wrong. So, no, it was never for selling items for materials or straight gold, and I've never seen anyone do that in classic. <br />
Maybe because you had to speak to a GM and explain it to him. Or because we just too polite and/or would've considered it lame to trade loot for the reasons you mentioned.</div></div><hr />

Ok, that's your experience. Blizzard had a different experience and that would explain the changes. The guild I was in was founded in 2006, and it was quite common for loot to be handled that way.</div></div><hr />
