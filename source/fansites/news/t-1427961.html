Armory Stats - Battle Pet Collection<br />
Today we are taking a look at the battle pet ownership achievement completion rate of players. Now that achievements are account wide, we can group characters by account and get an idea of what percentage of players (not characters) have completed an achievement.<br />
<br />
These numbers are based off of the players that have earned the achievements (http://www.wowdb.com/achievements/1017-can-i-keep-him) in the pet collection series and Raiding with Leashes (http://www.wowdb.com/achievements/7934-raiding-with-leashes), Raiding with Leashes II: Attunement Edition (http://www.wowdb.com/achievements/8293-raiding-with-leashes-ii-attunement-edition), Crazy for Cats (http://www.wowdb.com/achievements/8397-crazy-for-cats), and Celestial Family (http://www.wowdb.com/achievements/8519-celestial-family).<br />
<br />
The data used today is a sample of 8.1 million characters from 3 million accounts. The sample is slightly biased, as players who are not in a guild are much less likely to appear in our sample. You can leave suggestions for future stat posts in the comments!<br />

Warlords of Draenor<br />
During WoD beta I hope you guys will be on the Beta forums with us all like GC did for Wrath, it would mean alot to us.<br />
We definitely will. Beta is the time for lots of change, feedback and iteration. (Source (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/408304617093472257))<br />
<br />
Classes<br />
Are Raid CDs gonna be looked at/rehauled in WoD?<br />
We're looking at them, but nothing that we're ready to announce yet. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/408307281785155585))<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/imonks.gif Monk (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/341-Monk) / Skills (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/monk) / Talent Calculator (http://www.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#o))<br />
Cool. Just one last question; how do you guys feel about WW's new mastery? worked out in the end? I like it b/c of chibrew now<br />
Yeah, overall, Windwalker mastery (after several iterations) is looking fairly solid to us. Not perfect, but pretty good. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/408321951682154496))<br />
<br />
Any word on MW Monk Mastery? Currently scales horribly, and can be 100% negated by other players movement/lack of attention.<br />
What do you think of the Detonate Chi talent we showed at BlizzCon? (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/408304794969702400))<br />
having it as a talent means when you're spec'd for the other talents your mastery still goes back to scaling horribly<br />
What if it were baseline, not a talent? (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/408305759982592001))<br />
<br />
Is the intent with fist stance that you pick it and stay in it the whole fight or swap based on high/low damage phases?<br />
Swap based on phase is fine. Swap in between every few GCDs is not fine. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/408029630969290752))<br />
<br />
Character / Items<br />
What's the chance on transmogging between Axe/Mace/Sword and Polearm/Staff? Bigger issue with changing primary stats in 6.0.<br />
It's unlikely for both philosophical &amp; technical reasons. (Source (https://twitter.com/Dave_Maldo/status/408309981365026816))<br />
<br />
Will CDR trinkets change to Readiness rating in 6.0 to scale down as you level? Or going to be effectively &quot;turned off&quot; 100?<br />
Yes, the SoO trinkets that the new stats are based on will likely change to the new stat, in 6.0. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/408298535101022208))<br />
<br />
PvE<br />
Bosses bypass Armor quite often, is there changes to Armor incoming to make Bonus Armor more reliable?<br />
No, that's kind of the intended interesting part of Armor. It's good against the dragon's claws, not so good against his breath. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/408081393583808512))<br />
TBH I would appreciate it if things like Snapping Bite died a horrible death.<br />
Snapping Bite was a problem because it resulted in a significant tank imbalance on that fight, not because it ignored armor. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/408092953513435136))<br />
But the ignoring of armor is what caused the tank imbalance. Obviously I don't expect that to continue to be a thing.<br />
We have abilities that ignore armor all the time. Usually they're done in such a way that it affects tanks equally, but not here. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/408093252693139456))<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
Haven't really done much pvp in my 3 years playing wow Did a bit in wrath but thats about it What would you say I'm missing<br />
Personally, I love the variety of gameplay that PvP offers. Competition rarely plays out the same way twice in a row. (Source (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/408391176673189888))<br />
But, like any other part of WoW, your experience with PvP will have a lot to do with who you play with. (Source (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/408391257539346432))<br />
<br />
Why is it that the Vicious War Wolf isn't account wide, but the Skeletal Warhouse is? Please tell me it's an oversight.<br />
The Vicious Skeletal Warhorse? As far as I know it is not account wide. (Source (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/408016330684518400))<br />
<br />
Btw are you gonna keep r1 and glad percentages the same? Everyone is stoked - gonna increase incentive to playz!<br />
Our intent is to keep the relative number of rewards the same. Last season based on team count. This season on player count. (Source (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/407744725588783104))<br />
Despite what the Internet would have you believe, a larger % of playerbase is doing 3s than previous seasons. But not 3x. (Source (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/407745072591953920))<br />
Well sure - I'm just selfish and I wanna know if I should camp my grevious gladiator or no LOL :&gt;&gt;&gt;<br />
We are taking a look at it. The fact that more people are on the ladder since no team is required increases the pool size. (Source (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/407750918474461186))<br />

<br />
Tournament looks challenging in a fun way and the pets look among the best. Alas..I couldn't be bothered so far...sitting at 559 pets according to yay mount...no idea if it counts doubles (Blizzard UI says I have 575 pets, so I guess it does)</div></div><hr />

<br />
It takes 10 weeks to complete the achievement.<br />
Judging the popularity by that makes little sense</div></div><hr />

<br />
The fact that more than a third of players have 100+ pets, though, really is impressive considering how much effort goes into getting that 100 pre-pet battles, either from pure collecting or actually going through and capturing pets in the wild.<br />
<br />
I'd say the pet battle feature is a success, compared to how many people I see bothering with Archaeology anymore.</div></div><hr />

I assume you don't get the concept of a random loot; it took you a long time to get the Stalker, and you were quick to get the other pets, but that has no reflection on anyone else - I got the Stalker on my first kill, for example, but am still waiting for the Netherspace Abyssal. Some people in my guild completed it the week it came out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You do realize you're talking about a game within a game right? Everything about WoW is pointless and a waste of time. That's kind of what a pastime is by definition.<br />
<br />
I didn't think I'd like it, and I'm not wild over it, but it's fun enough. My husband says it's boring, but he loves Hearthstone, which to me seems to be about the same in general pace. IDIC.<br />
<br />
Oh, and the Coilfang Stalker is not my sticking point; the Netherspace Abyssal is, which requires traversing the vast majority of Karazhan as well as soloing the Chess event. It's been more annoying than I want to deal with.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;Back when vanity pets literally did nothing except follow you around and were the epitome of frivolous I collected them. But now that they're actually useful and were given a point to exist past just their graphic, I find them more pointless than I did when they were the only thing in the game that actually served no point.&quot;<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wildtree</div><div class="date">2013-12-27, 01:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It takes 10 weeks to complete the achievement.<br />
Judging the popularity by that makes little senseWell..... it's more than 1 achievement though<br />
<br />
One week for the Celestial Tournament Achievement.<br />
3 weeks for the Master of the Masters Achievement. <br />
10 weeks to collect the 4 pets, for Celestial Family Achievement.<br />
<br />
The tournament can be a little bit of a pain, when you start with it. <br />
Where people are getting trapped - and I admit this where Blizzard sorta drops the ball - is the misleading 15 level 25 pets requirement.<br />
No way in hell one can complete this scenario with only 15 pets. <br />
There's a total of 9 opponents in the scenario which rotate weekly, with each week giving you 3 of them. The sets of 3 are always the same, but still..<br />
The 4 Celestials after those 3 can be beaten with a combo of 4 pets total, unless the RNG gods hate you, and you don't have a backup.<br />
<br />
The combo for those is: Pandaren Water Spirit, Chrominius, Darkmoon Tonk. Have Magical Crawdad as healer at hand.<br />
Kill order: <br />
Xuen (he can once in a blue moon brutally crit and your strat fails)<br />
Niuzao (he can once in a while absorb too much dmg, and your strat can fail here too)<br />
Chi-Chi (absolutely no chance against the strat)<br />
Yu-Lon (same, no chance but has to be last, since you use him to heal in between)<br />
<br />
Strat, the same on all 4 Celestials:<br />
Water Spirit - Cast Geyser, Cast Whirlpool, SWAP OUT<br />
Chrominius - Cast Howl, Cast Surge of Power. <br />
<br />
This is normally enough to kill all 4.. However.. <br />
For Niuzao your Chrominius rotation should be: HOWL - BITE - SURGE OF POWER<br />
<br />
In between the fights, swap your Tonk for a Crawdad.. <br />
Open battle with Yu-Lon with Crawdad, Cast Wish. Swap to injured Pet, wait for heal to go off, abandon battle. Repeat for second hurt pet. <br />
BAM, your team is good to go again. Don't forget to put the Tonk back in before you move to the next.<br />
<br />
<br />
On Yu-Lon you might have to bring the Tonk in after Chrominius sometimes. His Rotation is: Shock and Awe - Ion Cannon<br />
<br />
It took me literally several hours for my first couple attempts. But nowadays, I've got it nailed down, and with a little luck, I finish it in about 30 minutes.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm too in the 5% and 0.5%.... And maybe even worse. lol<br />

Maybe blizz should scrap Mythic raiding and support more people with devoting that time to Pet Battles!<br />

(I am of course not being serious, but really trying to prove the point that people really should embrace that WoW is supported by and played by a wide variety of people for a wide variety of reasons and none of us would have anything without the other.)</div></div><hr />

<br />
You actually only need 3. Instead of the tonk you can use the crawdad(or a levelled up niuzao-pet) right away. Not to mention that bigglesworth would be the better choice instead of tonk anyway cause it can kill yu-lon all alone and can be used for a number a other fights too. But even if you play it safe and go with 4 pets...youz still got eleven for the other 3...and you only need 9 at max. Which means that it's easily possible to do at least one week with 15 pets.<br />
Usually there is a trainer among &quot;first set of 3&quot; where you can heal a pet with the crawdad too. So it should be possible to do 2 weeks with 15 pets as well....maybe even 3 is possible but that would likely need some luck and serious testing. Might be an interesting task for someone who wants to do something special.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There are probably only a few dozen people in the world who broke 600. Requires you to not only have every TCG pet, every promotional pet, along with owning the collector edition of every Blizzard game they released, attending every Blizzcon, the anniversary and 1 time events ( Olympics ) along with all the RAF pets. Warcraft pets has about 20 people listed with 600 or more and I would guess everyone who is really dedicated is listed there.<br />
<br />
I am #1 on my server (top 500 in world) and only have 576 and I only have about 10 more pets that I can possibly get ( if I decide to RAF 4 times). If the highest person on a server can´t even get close to an achievement.. eh.. probably shouldn´t be an achievement.<br />
<br />
The celestial tournament is not easy and can be annoying if you get bad RNG on the actual celestials and don´t have a backup team and have to start over.</div></div><hr />

I used to be a pet collector back in Cataclysm, back when 150 pets were considered to be a lot of pets that only a few people could ever dream of.<br />
<br />
Now with this silly Pokemon pet system, I no longer care about my pets. It's pointless and a waste of time.<br />

You're confused. Before it was pointless and a waste of time having those pets since they didn't do anything.</div></div><hr />

Then you'd want to check out warcraftpets.com and put yourself in the rankings. <br />
<br />
Alternatively, WoWProgress keeps a score and rank for everyone who's updated their armory profile in a while.<br />
e.g. http://www.wowprogress.com/petscore<br />
<br />
i'm at #2543 with 556 of 581 collected uniques, but i'm getting a bit sick of the process post 5.3. haven't bothered trying to get the TI pets all that much due to egregious and heinous RNG from drops. and once you've been grinding for a month, it gets boring as hell. <br />
<br />
if i think about it, i just haven't done much since about april 2013, it got really tedious all of a sudden once i'd collected the majority of pets. nothing that's been added has improved the process or made it better, just harder.<br />
<br />
still have 150 odd uncommon -&gt; rare's to go, and 30 odd pets left to collect, but i'm not in a rush to level or get all the speed/power variants or build teams to fight celestial/fable pets, it's a joke.</div></div><hr />
