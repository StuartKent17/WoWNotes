<br />
I think the intent behind the nerf is to make crit more meaningful in the long term. We're in the first tier of raiding and with BRF gear it's almost possible to hit 43% crit chance (crit depression vs bosses included, and past that would be useless or yield much less dps due to the careful aim crit bonus). Chimaera Shot got a giant buff at least.</div></div><hr />

Uhh it definitely is a major content patch. X.1, X.2, X.3, ect are used for big content patches. The small ones are usually X.0.2, X.0.3, ect.<br />
<br />
By calling it 6.1, they are saying its a major content patch.<br />
<br />
Too bad they're barely adding a thing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To be completely fair, they haven't ALWAYS been used for major content patches. In BC and Classic x.y patches were used for new features as well. Do you not remember patch 2.2, the patch that implemented Voice Chat, for example? It's only since Wrath that x.y patches have been used purely for major content releases. It may be that they're just reverting to the old numbering system so they can push new features faster without waiting for new content to be ready to go with it. Wasn't &quot;smaller patches, faster&quot; something they wanted to target a few years back?</div></div><hr />

How does that make sense.<br />
<br />
It makes perfect sense. That's how they were doing it for a long time before Wrath when they decided that every patch had to be a huge-ass patch, which meant that new features would be sitting on the burner for months waiting to be released with new content when these new features were already complete.</div></div><hr />

Gigantic feature to help colourblind players and let them customise exactly for their individual needs<br />

I intent do cancel my sub once my group finishes HC BRF, because there is barely anything else to do for me as of now and 6.1 is adding almost nothing that could entertain me for more than a single month. Sadly, I might add.</div></div><hr />

I do, but it makes more sense for players like me whose lives have gotten busier in the years since we started. The content is more than enough and play options are ideal for small windows of opportunity to grab a couple hours of game time. Cost is insignificant--by far the least im likely to spend/hr of entertainment.</div></div><hr />

Correction, they said it in a recent interview:<br />
<br />
&quot;There are a lot of surprises and exciting stories in store for Patch 6.2. A lot of the information is laid out in quests so far and 6.1 quests will add some more story.&quot;</div></div><hr />

BRF is going to be in week #4 when patch 6.1 is released (and in LFR week #2). That's a good thing! <br />
<br />
Decoupling point release patches such as 6.1 from new raid content potentially gives us raid content earlier and we don't have to wait for unimportant features (blood elves update / twitter integration / etc) to be ready for release.<br />
<br />
Yes, there could be new content other than a new raid - But honestly there's more than enough to do in WOD. I am actually glad apexis crystals are useless and I don't feel the need to do the apexis daily on all of my toons. The tamagotchi effect of the garrison is real.<br />
Only issue I am seeing is PvP is boring atm. Not sure why.</div></div><hr />

They don't like customers spamming a stupid youtube video at them like an angry toddler who knows how to copy and paste.<br />

Blizzard released a patch for their game. It fixes some things, it adds some things. It's a patch. That what it does. Not every initial patch for an expansion has had a raid in it, and the ones that have were released months later in their expansions timeline than this one. There's plenty to do right now, as it stands, and plenty of stuff being added. This is full of quality of life changes and minor content additions. Would you rather all of these needed changes sit on the shelf for several months waiting for a raid to be finished?<br />
<br />
I don't know if WoW is just babbys first game or what, but it's like people don't remember that &quot;patch&quot; doesn't always equal &quot;raid&quot; or even &quot;content&quot; (which has simply become a nebulous buzzword angry people use to try and blanket the whole of 6.1 as somehow being non-existent, I guess)</div></div><hr />

At this point in time in MoP, we had 5.1. Infact, we would have had 5.1 last month if I remember right.<br />

Its less that the first patch is small, more so that it took this long for so little. Blizz has been releasing content slower and slower while they keep promising it'll be faster. Its pathetic.</div></div><hr />

i wish i'd never bought this expansion. i wasted so much money. this expansion was the most expensive one and yet it felt like paid beta. i couldn't be more disappointed. <br />
there isn't even a single thing i'd like to achieve. all those mounts look like different colored shit beside poundfist. reputations aren't worth a copper aswell. nothing interesting/usefull to get there. garrison is boring as fuck. <br />
<br />
just give people some recolors of old mounts and let them pay for the awesome unique models. or all the things everyone of us would have thought of while developing this beta expansion like garrisons simply being to much for every alt or the 630gear from follower missions being account wide... or all those things that were promised but never made it into release like the heirlroom stuff ( which is ridiculous... buying a herilroom, then buying upgrades....is this a joke?) <br />
<br />
i dont feel like a well treated customer. this game isn't fun anymore. i guess that was the last time i bought gametime. too bad they changed the raf thingy... 1 month for 10k gold was awesome.</div></div><hr />

Do not get me wrong, but everything that actually is in 6.1 does take time to develop.<br />
<br />
I am getting really sick of &quot;Delayed Content&quot; bullshit, Blood Elf models is not 6.0 content, they originally stated that Derani and Blood Elfs would be added after launch. Also Taanan Jungle was NEVER planned to be 6.0 content, the only &quot;delayed&quot; feature is the Heirloom tab.<br />
<br />
And there is some playable content (new daily quests, 6 summonable bosses) etc.<br />
<br />
I think they added to many features and forgot that we actually want to continue the story, in reality if 6.1 had something like 5.1 dailies it might be being crowned as the best patch ever.<br />
<br />
But man there is so much hyperbole in this thread in the highest I think I have ever seen in MMO-C history (and that is saying something).<br />

If 6.2 contains the next raid tier and Blizzard intends to have only two raid tiers like they have mentioned before then 6.2 is THE END OF WOD. Since there is no story advancement in patch 6.1 besides the small amount from the legendary quest that would mean WoD would have only had two patches in its entirety where ANYTHING happened.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Totally agree. Players that are not happy can show it with their wallet and stop playing now. Thats the only way to get your point across if your not happy. We will see at least 3-4 months now until 6.2 (considering they havn't even started talking about it) and this is probably perfect time for many to take a break and come back later on IF things improve.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Prime046</div><div class="date">2015-02-18, 08:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I find the timing pretty hilarious. With claims of 6.1 already being pretty lacking in content they choose to release their 'big' patch right when Square is releasing patch 2.51 for FFXIV, the second half of the already big patch that was 2.5 just a few weeks ago which added quite a large amount of things in itself right there.<br />
<br />
So next week FFXIV is getting stuff like:<br />
•Gold Saucer: Huge FF7 inspired casino like area with mini-games and area wide events that players can participate in as well as other things like scratch card gambling etc.<br />
•Triple Triad: Everyone's favorite card game from FF8 is making a fully fledged appearance in FFXIV where you can battle against other NPCs and win to collect their cards, over 80 cards to collect from dungeons/bosses/winning cards from other NPCs, and the ability to play Triple Triad vs. other players as well. It even comes with multiple game modes, one where you can see the opponents hand and strategize accordingly, one where both players are assigned completely random cards from their collections. On top of that they are adding in areas throughout the world where players can gather, sit down and enjoy card battling against each other.<br />
•Chocobo Racing: Not only do you get to race other players on racing tracks throughout the world you have the ability to raise your own set of chocobos and breed them, gain stats and keep improving to get the best kind of chocobo you want to go for.<br />
<br />
Now keep in mind FFXIV has been doing this for over a YEAR now. They consistently bring out big patches about every 3 months, it's amazing just how much we've gotten and honestly it makes me quite sad to see Blizzard pale in comparison these days because I genuinely do want to enjoy WoW but with the rate they have been going it's just hard to get back into the game. But Blizzard takes FOREVER to get their patches out, and the patches aren't even all that great.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can not have it both ways. The 10 bosses players got in BRF was OFFICIALLY claimed by Blizzard to be part of the launch content. If not .. then WOD has the lowest amount of raiding content of any expansion ever at launch. It was gated and definitely not ready when the expansion was launched. But again. Then Blizzard maybe should have shut their mouth instead of playing the PR trump card. I think thats right now the main reason why players are upset. Most can see through the PR that has been going on for past 4-5 years. Now it's time for Blizzard to let their work do the talking - 6.1 shows that´s not really happening. Their main focus seems to be to drag out the little content they actually have available for as long as possible.<br />
<br />
What we can look at are facts. 17 total raid bosses in two raids is a FACT before 6.2 launches. You can go and look up what we had many raid bosses before x.2 in other expansions.</div></div><hr />

Some people do use Twitter to post WoW stuff, but those people are in the minority. If Blizzard was serious about this they would have put in an achievement and a pet/mount reward for syncing a twitter account to your battle.net. But they didn't. This feature shouldn't have even been mentioned in the video. Advertising it like they have just alienates the majority of the people who don't care about twitter.<br />
<br />
Same thing goes for the color blindness settings. They're neat for people who are color blind, but those people are definitely in the minority. This shouldn't be listed as a &quot;major feature&quot; either.<br />
<br />
Where's the centerpiece of this patch? Where's the big thing that gets everyone excited, no matter how good their eyesight is nor how many tweets they've sent? You need something here.<br />
<br />
I think the biggest slap in the face is when he said &quot;an ultra rare mount&quot; and they showed a recolor of a recolor. That's pretty lazy.<br />
<br />
To Blizzard Developers: I know you'll never read this, but seriously... if you guys just put in one of those super high quality &quot;store&quot; mounts as a &quot;super rare reward&quot; in a patch like this one, you'd get far less complaining. People love mounts, and people love earning mounts. Put in an awesome mount that is completely unique and it'll pay off.<br />
<br />
But no, you just put in Raven Lord 3.0.<br />
<br />
Boring patch. Very boring.</div></div><hr />

I agree, but unfortunately it's hard to come up with a story relevant trailer when there's nothing story relevant in the patch.</div></div><hr />

i wish i'd never bought this expansion. i wasted so much money. this expansion was the most expensive one and yet it felt like paid beta. i couldn't be more disappointed. <br />
there isn't even a single thing i'd like to achieve. all those mounts look like different colored shit beside poundfist. reputations aren't worth a copper aswell. nothing interesting/usefull to get there. garrison is boring as fuck. <br />
<br />
just give people some recolors of old mounts and let them pay for the awesome unique models. or all the things everyone of us would have thought of while developing this beta expansion like garrisons simply being to much for every alt or the 630gear from follower missions being account wide... or all those things that were promised but never made it into release like the heirlroom stuff ( which is ridiculous... buying a herilroom, then buying upgrades....is this a joke?) <br />
<br />
i dont feel like a well treated customer. this game isn't fun anymore. i guess that was the last time i bought gametime. too bad they changed the raf thingy... 1 month for 10k gold was awesome.<br />
<br />
What are you talking about? After the shittest expansion I could ever imagine (MoP), WoD is quite good, probably even better than Cata. Ofc it has nothing to go with TBC or WotLK, which were amazing but still, WoD isn't that bad like MoP was. Maybe next expansion will get that game back to somewhere around TBC/WotLK (but they would have to get back it to the level of hardcore as primary, not damn casuality....)</div></div><hr />

New Belf models, updates to old models (gnomes saggy eyes gone, Nelf male run animation) <br />
Newer more realist lighting system (remember the old water graphics?)<br />
Fantastic update to heirlooms which haven't been changed since they were introduced 6 years ago<br />
Updates to garrison, adding more abilities, items, missions, quests <br />
Gigantic feature to help colourblind players and let them customise exactly for their individual needs<br />

And most people probably still haven't touched much of heroic BRF or even normal blackhand. <br />

Everyone on the forums is apparently an expert game designer who could have made 6.1 over the course of a week.<br />

I made a video of a snowman taking off his head and waving in a design class in a few hours, I'm clearly more qualified to do models and animation than Blizzard for a highly complex and advanced MMO!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Meh. I absolutely loved WoD on release and loved the leveling experience and I was one of the very few here and everywhere else championing Blizzard when everyone else was hating on them for stability and realm issues at the start (for various reasons, it wasn't really an issue for me except for a couple of hours in a queue on day 2). But now, well. The story is changed and I've been unsubbed for a while now. I've never unsubbed so fast after an expansion hit, especially given how positive I was about this one at the start. I played MoP fairly consistently throughout, only not playing during the long lull during the SoO era; Cata I was unsubbed for a very long time but it was a lot longer than two months before I threw in the towel. <br />
<br />
I know it's just my experience and it's largely also that I have little time for WoW anymore, no matter how good it is. But I really, really thought WoD would be better than MoP and Cata and it's not. It's just as bad, albeit with a slightly better setting and storyline.<br />
<br />
In before &quot;then why are you here&quot;. Because I'm waiting for the news that it's gotten better, and Blizzard have listened to feedback.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Why are people acting like 6.1 is the first time Blizzard has ever made a patch without raid content?<br />
<br />
Because it's not.<br />
<br />
They've made plenty of patches without raid content.<br />
<br />
How many &quot;major&quot; (i.e. x.1, x.2 etc) patches have had no new PvE or PvP content at all?</div></div><hr />

<br />
6.1 is just the leftovers from the launch that they delayed and some enhancements to the UI, they had to release it quickly because they removed heirlooms completely from the game meanwhile, and blood elf models were also delayed, they just packaged all that into a patch.<br />

So are belfs getting released with 6.1 (guilty for not checking) if they are. They didn't even seem ready to go live. Well I haven't checked PTR in a couple weeks.

This is exactly it. They got out a very polished leveling experience then poorly delivered at end game. Highmaul was boring, Garrison campaign is good but bugged for a lot of people and still could have been better implemented/ Apexis crystals and the associated daily became useless quick and i wont even mention the Ashran disaster..... <br />
<br />
At least 6.1 is here now meaning 6.2 Tanaan and some actual content will be talked about soon...</div></div><hr />

I think it's retarded how Blizzard is trying to tone down Arm's burst damage in PvP but consquentially fucks over warriors in PvE, specifically Fury. It just seems ignorant how we're not being compesated for this loss considering Fury isn't overpowered at single target.<br />

Yep, some of the reasons I aint playing anymore, it just became boring, but appearantly successful at drawing people in, as evidenced by people from 3 realms wanting me to raid with them, unlike MoP.

I think that list is about it.<br />
<br />
The only correction I would make is that Blood Elf Models where not &quot;planned at launch&quot; in fact it was stated that both Derani and Blood Elf models would be added later.<br />
<br />
I did 100% want more playable content in 6.1, especially if 6.2 is the last patch of the xpac (if they go two tiers).<br />
<br />
That would mean we would of had 1 meaningful story patch the entire expac, I don't care if the epxac is only 18 months long, I don't think that is good enough at all.</div></div><hr />

Players that are not happy can show it with their wallet and stop playing now. Thats the only way to get your point across if your not happy. We will see at least 3-4 months now until 6.2 (considering they havn't even started talking about it) and this is probably perfect time for many to take a break and come back later on IF things improve.<br />
<br />
The problem with this mentality is that I'm progressing through BRF right now with my guild. I can be unhappy with what Blizzard is doing and I can no longer feel as though my game time is worth the $15 that I pay but it isn't worth $0. So I won't unsub because I still have Blackhand and Blast Furnace to beat on HC. If Blizzard had not staggered the releases of HM and BRF then I would have completed both on HC by now. I would have unsubbed from the game the moment I finished watching the 6.1 patch trailer. <br />
<br />
People argue that there is plenty to do like achievements and old content and brawlers guild etc, but there has always been plenty to do and I'm not trying to say that there isn't. The problem is that Blizzard is nickle and diming us with their content by not only staggering a raid that was planned for release but then using that schedule to give the illusion of no content drought when 6.1 comes out and there's no new stuff to do. <br />
<br />
My main point is that I no longer feel like $15 is the amount I want to pay but I only have two choices: sub or unsub.</div></div><hr />

New Belf models, updates to old models (gnomes saggy eyes gone, Nelf male run animation) <br />
Newer more realist lighting system (remember the old water graphics?)<br />
Fantastic update to heirlooms which haven't been changed since they were introduced 6 years ago<br />
Updates to garrison, adding more abilities, items, missions, quests <br />
Gigantic feature to help colourblind players and let them customise exactly for their individual needs<br />
<br />
And most people probably still haven't touched much of heroic BRF or even normal blackhand. <br />
But eyyyy there's nothing in the patch right<br />
<br />
Do you not understand what CONTENT actually is? And when we use content here the context is totally different. models and texture updates are not content. Content is something I can use or do. I cant DO anything with a model update. Colorblind changes? how large is the colorblind userbase that this was a needed feature requiring manpower to develop? Are there any situations in this game that would deny something to someone that IS colorblind? Lighting updates? you mane something that should have been added when they updated the water effects? Thanks, I guess.<br />
<br />
I will agree with the heirlooms. Garrisions can get bent for all most of us care. Its a fucking minigame. I literally click on things and I get stuff back. Its farmville: Wow edition, FFS. Have fun with that garrision in the next xpac because it wont transfer over. All that gold spent on upgrades and plans just to build the upgrades, wasted x10 toons. I have a lvl 3 garrision and Feel like it was a colossal waste of time. I know for a FACT I am not alone in this feeling. Selfies and twitter integration? who the FUCK asked, I mean actually requested, that it be added into the game? What drooling mongoloid? Wasted resources, a recurring theme lately, on a portion of the game that few will actually use. Can't think there are a whole of people still streaming WOW these days. Lets also attach cheeves to it. Un fucking real.<br />
<br />
CONTENT!?!?! I will say this as politely as I can. Blizzard can get bent with a rusty fireplace poker. I have had it with people defending their shady ass business practices. I have nothing against a company making money. Apparently the 15/month x 10 million isn't enough to keep the electricity on And Don in the wine cooler. They have expense you say. Well doesn't every company? Their overhead is DWARFED by their profit. DWARFED!!! Greedy doesn't even BEGIN to encompass this company now.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">turlockmike</div><div class="date">2015-02-18, 05:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm hestinant to call this a full patch. I work as a software engineer and if we released a major release with no actual features I would get funny looks. Given that wow's success has been constant content, not having any content is really hurting. I think I can kinda see what happened.<br />
<br />
1. WOD is released and hugely praised by everyone. Garrisons/treasures/world elites/multiple avenues for gearing all gave players a way to enjoy early level 100 stuff. However, when it came raid time, players got in, started doing normal highmaul and everything else became secondary (especially dungeons). So, now players have less incentive to do things (garrisons, farming, dungeons) since they outgear most of it and the best stuff is a huge time sink (and possibly a waste if you get better heroic gear), players are left wondering what to do. <br />
<br />
Here is what I currently do in wow<br />
1. Raid normal BRF in pugs on my alts<br />
2. Raid heroic/mythic BRF in my guild<br />
3. Complete follower mission garrison stuff once a day. (I've stopped mining/herbing since the prices have dropped so low)<br />
4. Twiddle my thumbs.<br />
<br />
I think the problem is easily fixed, but blizzard doesn't like the solution as it creates a very strong incentive.<br />
1. Increase ilvl of gear from valor(apexis crystals). Allow you to only wear one valor piece at a time if needed. <br />
2. Increase ilvl of gear from professions. Only allow two pieces to be equipped.<br />
3. Increase rewards from daily dungeons (more valor/earn a free bonus roll by completing 3 dungeons in a week)<br />
4. Either increase daily quest rewards or reduce gold inflation that is occurring. <br />
5. Max level zone with an actual reason to do it (raid comparable gear).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Do you know how software versioning works? 6.1 IS a major content release in Blizzard's system, otherwise it would have been labeled something like 6.0.5<br />
<br />
No idea how they decided this consisted of enough features/content to be deemed &quot;major.&quot; The biggest updates are graphical ones (anti-aliasing and such), but that's a very fine-tuned section of their tech department that worked solely on that.</div></div><hr />

Um, no. BRF always had higher tier gear. It was never intended to launch at the same time as highmaul. If it were, highmaul would have been a waste of time, as LFR blackrock would have been a faster gear progression path than norm/H highmaul</div></div><hr />

<br />
and it was supposed to be - just like MV in mop - but blizzard clearly knew BEFORE launch they wont have any content coming in first half of year of expansion and that was the main reason they delayed BrF - not cause it would be to much to progres but because they knew they have no other content to release over god knows how long. none . nada null not even fucking daily zone - and thats why people are so pissed. <br />
<br />
everything in 6.1 should have been in during launch of expansion - all tuning new bl models heirloom tab - but blizzard simply didnt made it in time for launch and now are pretneding its content patch when most probably it was ready months ago.</div></div><hr />

Seems like people forget about this too often when others complain. I mean lets face it, WoD is already 3 months old. People have already paid $45 to be able to play a game that for the most part doesnt change. I doubt server costs per individual is $15 a month, and everyone know I am not paying a quality of customer service.<br />
<br />
Sub fees are one of those things blizzard is gunna do until they can no longer get away with it, it isnt necessary for any upkeep, and it doesnt even pay for a service anymore.</div></div><hr />

Yes, and there is not enough content there to start with. Not even close. It's an insane situation. People who love the game waited for a long time through a massive barren spell in the game (where they should have unsubbed or at least have been rewarded for playing a game that had no new content for a year after last MOP patch) then they are *rewarded* with a new expansion that is paper thin and promised all will be addressed then insulted with a threadbare first expansion.<br />
<br />
It's taking the piss, there is no other way to see it.<br />
<br />
I have no doubt Blizzard will come back but these last few years have been dark as hell. And not cause the nights are back. WTF happened to that, why can't they do anything right?<br />

All those that were conned back in 'Wow is back, it's TBC part 2!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!' have left in the last 2 months. I'd pay to play TBC. But I can't.<br />

Now its an empty husk of a company only concerned with profits and less about integrity and quality. Its a damn shame. I can remember getting warcraft on a 2.5 floppy from a computer show. Lost vikings. The original starcraft that WASN'T split into 3 separate chapters that you had to buy 3 times. The original had different box art, that you could CHOOSE to buy, that I STILL own. Those cinematics had more emotion and personality than ANYTHING they have made since. WotLK Trailers are pretty fucking close to that.</div></div><hr />

You seriously don't understand why people are having an issue with this hyped up patch. Time and energy wasted on fucking twitter and a fucking selfie camera, WITH achievements attached to it!!!!! You MUST be joking.<br />

Money and power corrupt. They have lost their way since Cataclysm. The best thing that can happen to Blizzard now is for them to crash and burn. Let them start from the ground up again. They need to earn back their customers. The first way to do that is to get rid of all the lead developers and for the love of god keep Chris Metzen on another project as far from WoW as possible. I would start with canning that arrogant twat Afrasiabi and his buddy Kaplan. Those fucking guys are a cancer.</div></div><hr />

And comparing this patch to a major raid patch is... Unwise. This is a small content patch, relatively speaking. I won't use the twitter or selfie stuff, but I don't care that it exists. The people who developed it aren't the people designing raids or balancing classes. Calm down.<br />
<br />
Also, looks like Garona is our legendary follower. That's amazing.<br />

What part of LAUNCH RAID are you having issues understanding? Hm? Words too hard for you? Your argument makes no fucking sense since MSV had lower gear than HOF and both were LAUNCH RAIDS. Shit, there are those words again, you're probably confused now.<br />
<br />
Technically incorrect. All of these raids were in at launch, but weren't all available right away. Blizzard decided that MSV wasn't up for long enough as current content - and they are right, it because pointless as soon as HOF was open.</div></div><hr />

Yeah you're right. I should really be comparing this patch to something like patch 1.10<br />

Hehehe yeah. FFXIV gets more in a .0.1 patch than WOW gets in a .1 and yet they have about 160.000.000 usd in Sub money every month while XIV is about 6.500.000. And their team is extremely minimal compared to WOW. About 5 people have made all the raids and monster designs in raids and the world. Which makes me scratch my head just how very little WOW's fans are getting in return compared to XIVs fans. Imo Blizzard is not treating their fans like they should imo. Either Yoshida's Dev team is just that more enthusiastic and working harder or Blizzard is underperforming.<br />
<br />
Blizzard also said they dont feel like doing a different Class Combo like Gnome Hunters until an Expansion, while XIV put in 1 new class and 1 new Job in a PATCH. And in their expansion Heavensward, we are getting a whole 3 new classes, Dark Knight tank, Machinist Ranged Pistol DPS and Astrologian Healer as well as a new Race, the Au'Ra. <br />
<br />
<br />
Just look at the patch trailers for every .1 patch of XIV so far and compare to ANY of WOWs expansions or Classic<br />
Even patch 2.1 introduced Player Housing system and Wolves Den a PVP area. <br />
And of course: HILDIBRAND. the best ever side story questline ever. Hope they really continue with Hildibrand in 3.0<br />
<br />

Oh and finally, with all these patches, they also do class balancings, Quality of Life addtitons, colorblind setting, they just dont make them out to be part of the main features of a patch, but usually tucked away furtherst down on the patch notes ;)<br />
<br />
I mean when I saw patch 6.1's Survival Guide VS Lores other Survivial Guides, I facepalmed. Selfie, Twitter, colorblind, QoL and Bug fixes as Main Features, siiiiigh<br />
I am also disappointed of Lore as when he said he was hired by Blizzard, he would still be critical about the game and make an impact on it.<br />
Like he almost laughed at people asking on his PST if Blizzard would ever implement a paid max lvl character saying he would be sad if they did that, and when they added it in WOD, he made an video on how it worked and sounded so happy about it. <br />
<br />
Blizzard is also nowhere near as open and honest as Yoshida is with his Liveletter on Youtube where he also accepts questions live. He even shows us tidbits of future stuff to come, even if that pissed off the Dev team slightly xD</div></div><hr />
