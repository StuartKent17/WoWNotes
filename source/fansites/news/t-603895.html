You might experience a short downtime on the site during the morning (EST Time), it probably won't last more than 15 minutes. 
 
Anyway, servers should be much better today and the downtime should improve them even more, I'm not sure of what will happen with the download servers I tested yesterday but for the moment they're still here, so enjoy them.

List of changes<br />
Everything is in the 2.3.2 Changes post (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=2506.0) kid !<br />
<br />
Also, if you tried to copy a warlock during the week end, it's probably not usable.<br />
The premade warlocks that were copied over the weekend (Undead and human) were broken and not allowing players to log in with them. These characters are un-recoverable. If you copied a premade warlock and can not log in with it go ahead and delete the character.<br />
<br />
New premade warlock templates have been created (orc and human) and are working correctly.<br />
<br />
We do not currently plan to reset premade characters. Many patches ago in anticipation of problems like this arising we increased the original premade limit of two per account to four per account. So for all effects and purposes you have already received two extra premades. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=3547615689&amp;sid=1&amp;pageNo=1#7))<br />

No server downtimes during Holidays<br />
Good news, according to Nethaera there won't be any long downtimes during holidays. <br />
Over the holidays, on December 25th and January 1st, we will be performing a series of rolling restarts for all realms starting at 5:00 AM PDT, in lieu of weekly maintenance. Each realm is anticipated to be down for no more than 15 minutes, and should additional maintenance be necessary, we will notify our players in advance. Have a happy holiday!<br />
<br />
<br />
Blue posts<br />
Nothing really impressive today, upcoming christmas holiday probably don't help. However we might finally get the explanation of the mechanics behind the new AV points calculation &quot;soon&quot;.<br />
Alterac Valley points calculation<br />
Clarification on the new calculation of AV points introduced a few weeks ago should be available prior to the weekend. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=3121115642&amp;sid=1&amp;pageNo=37#737))<br />
<br />
Invisible mode.<br />
The idea of adding an invisible mode to the game (=hiding your status online status on /who or friend lists) has been brought up a few times, Blizzard doesn't feel that having this option is a beneficial addition to a multiplayer game. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=3547794950&amp;pageNo=1&amp;sid=1#2))<br />
<br />
XP Shut off<br />
There are no current plans to let players &quot;block&quot; their xp gains intentionally just to avoid leveling. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=3466339453&amp;pageNo=1&amp;sid=1#12))<br />
<br />
Old PvP Ranks<br />
If developpers feel there is a compelling reason and it fits well with the game to bring them back, we could do it, but for the time being they have no plans to do so. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=3168521020&amp;pageNo=2&amp;sid=1#21))<br />
<br />
Will new races ever be added ?<br />
&quot;Never is a bad word to use, there is always the possibility of this happening in the future, we just don't plan to do it for Wrath of the Lich King.&quot; (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=3547875772&amp;pageNo=1&amp;sid=1#15))</div></div><hr />

probably, this happened with AQ gates and even to a certain extent TBC itself. they don't want to release new content during the holidays because they are either short-staffed or don't want to risk breaking the game when they will surely have an increased server load given so many people are off.</div></div><hr />

However, next time it might be a good idea to report it instead of complaining about it and saying &quot;LOL&quot; and &quot;IT'S WRONNNNG&quot;, none of the people who replied took the time to report to a mod. (other people did)</div></div><hr />
