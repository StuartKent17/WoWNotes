Rets are fine. Give them more dmg and they will dominate in PVP again and then will be nerfed back. PVE'ers be happy that some of the BEST guilds are still using Rets on heroic Ragnaros, check Flash from Vodka, for example.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Probably a PTR for bugfixes plus anything new they're planning on doing/adding for Brewfest/Hallow's End this year. If there's anything client side they need for those events they might want to get it dealt with before they move onto the 4.3 PTR series.</div></div><hr />

Anyways, This still keeps happening (http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/955192-Patch-4.2.2-on-Test-Realms-soon?p=12664695&amp;viewfull=1#post12664695), Anyone know of a way to get the PTR launcher to reconfirm whats needed to download? This doesn't seem right. Can't download 7.8 gigs worth of data on a unstable, 100 kB/s wifi connection... ;_;<br />
<br />
EDIT: Found a way to reduce the amount needed to download to about 1.8 gigs... only works though if your PTR and retail build are the SAME exact build number I think. Gotta rename the data folder in the PTR folder temporarily till you're done. Than, copy your /Data/ folder over to the PTR installation (which should have 'Data_OLD' folder or something. Give it ~5 mins to copy the ~23 gigs, then copy the contents of the old realmlist.wtf in the Data_OLD folder into the new Data folder (so that you can connect and patch with the PTR), than delete launcher.wtf in your WTF folder. If it works, relaunching the launcher will have it down to ~2 gigs worth you need to download. (which is still high i think, but better than it was for me). By now, you can delete your old Data folder if you wish.</div></div><hr />

Rets are not fine. Raidbots 25 man heroic mode listing of top 100 dps also disagrees with you. Paragons Ret had this to say: http://www.paragon.fi/forum/viewtopic.php?f=30&amp;t=2355. Ret in Firelands is pretty bad, due to a combination of the raids mechanics and Rets own problems. Enhance Shaman had a similar issue before this tier, which seems to have been evened out somewhat.<br />
<br />
Both Ret Paladins and Enhance Shaman have the same issues, mainly scaling, and heavy reliance on one secondary stat (Mastery). Only difference between Ret and Enhance is that Ret also has too much reliance on cds, and as a result sustained dps is lacklustre, while burst is a bit too heavy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I for one am not hoping that...<br />
<br />
I would like to see them use the cash people who play their game throw at them and come up with NEW stuff instead of recycling stuff that was boring years ago. I ran all the past instances until death, and really if I wouldn't be forced to do them I wouldn't visit them again. I think I did about 6 recyrcled ZG/ZA in total, just can't take it, it's the same stuff I did 2 to 5 years ago.<br />
<br />
And god I hope anything that comes next it not fire themed, brown and orange.<br />

We have a Ret and we're killing heroic bosses in Firelands just fine, soon Ragna will be down too. Just because someone ins't surfing the top of that skada/recount meters doesn't mean the class is broken. And I couldn't give two shits about what guys from Paragon, Method, Vodka, you name it, say. Every single one of those guilds is looking excuses to change the classes in their favor - Just because WoW is your job, doesn't mean everything you say is law.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Did you have an old PTR installed or did you wipe at the end of the testing phrase for the last PTR you participated in ?<br />
<br />
Because you aren't supposed to do that - on the old EU forums there used to be a sticky about it. The PTR is designed to be a separate install that you just update at the beginning of each test phrase.<br />
<br />
Also you should be wiping wow.mfil , wow.tfil and the launcher.wtf files in the WTF folder if you're going to replace the Data folder with one from Live. These files tell the launcher how much has been downloaded , whats to download , what the checksums of the files are as well as the torrent file data needed for download. Its possible that if you wipe those files as well there would be even less to download. Wiping and letting the launcher recreate these will make the launcher re-evaluate what it needs to download.<br />
<br />
Me I started up my 4.2 PTR install that I had faithfully kept updated to the latest build and only had to download 15-16 MB</div></div><hr />

They seem to use that login screen a lot on the PTR. I don't know why, though.<br />

When it first came up a few patches ago, I thought they might be making a new login-screen and just using that as a placeholder, but at this point I doubt that.</div></div><hr />

Too bad they'd be better off replacing them with more Arcane Mages, who bring the same 3% dmg buff, more FMs to feed the other casters (especially the even more overpowered Shadow Priests), and about 8k more DPS apiece.<br />

Apparently, there were a few things that simply couldn't be hotfixed, and they, again apparently, wanted to make sure they weren't breaking something else with their fixes. And, it seems, that 4.3 is on the horizon, so opening the PTR at this time seemed appropriate.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And that's why they are fine? Rofl. Ret is the worst modelled spec in the game. No peel, no CC (repentance cannot be compared to any other CC.. It doesnt even take away ticking dots in order to give a good chance of cc'ing the target), no dmg (except with wings), no gap closer, boring and slow mechanic, bad survivability that you cannot really use actively (SS procs), stupid mechanic of wog. Bubble is pure nonsense, since rets lack mana to use bubble to heal themselves accordingly in order to not die directly after bubble turned off. CS is parried, missed (nightelf) or dodged and you can actually go and take a piss until you can click another ability that requires Holy Power. We lack our ressource big time! And that is pretty damn ridiculous.<br />
<br />
Our main attack (TV) deals a joke amount of dmg in pvp and the frequence in what you can use TV in pvp is close to zero.. And hey, I have 5% crit in PvP Equip. You can skill 12% for TV and judgement and 15% for CS. Sorry, but the retribution spec is utter crap and really really stupid. The worst spec in the whole friggin game. And I haven't even mentioned Holy Wrath.. The insult of all &quot;fillers&quot;. We need it to have something to do every 15 seconds and to get our chance to proc divine purpose, but it kills all CC, even critters, and deals no mentionable dmg.. And Inquisition.. Since we are so vulnerable to fear, I always party when I see me running around, losing my Inq and have to rebuild it via hard work again just to be feared afterwards..<br />
<br />
Not to mention that spamming purge (mana problems where?) completely disables the ret. <br />
<br />
The only good thing a ret can do is healing others.. God, I hate this spec so much, but I rather quit this game before I quit my char or reroll. Because rerollers are even more pathetic than the intelligence Blizzard has put into the Retribution spec.<br />

Watching my buddy in Wrath practically one-shotting person after person in Arathi Basin with &quot;Decent&quot; gear? They used to Dominate if you played them well enough. I'll admit they are broken now though.</div></div><hr />

The Retribution &quot;Dominance&quot; of PvP was less than 24 hours. It wasn't during Wrath, it was during the Wrath &quot;preview&quot; in the last days of TBC. Those are the one-shots you are thinking of.2. Ret has been asking for less burst and more sustained. Making that a reality would be a combination of buffs and nerfs. So please don't assume any Retribution adjustment would automatically make them OP in PvP.3. Ret needs a way to consciously burn through a lot of mana for increased effect, outside of healing. Otherwise, having mana for DPS is a joke. It's not something you have to &quot;manage&quot;. If you never heal and never hit Consecrate, you could practically remove your mana bar from your UI and still be fine.</div></div><hr />
