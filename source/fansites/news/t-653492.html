The patch 3.2 official notes have been updated with more changes to Lake Wintergrasp.<br />
Wintergrasp<br />
To provide players with a more transparent notification of when Wintergrasp battles occur, as well as better control zone population and stability, several changes have been made.<br />
Players now have the option to queue for Wintergrasp from a Wintergrasp Battlemaster in any capital city or by simply entering the Wintergrasp zone.<br />
Queuing will begin 15 minutes before each battle. If chosen, you will automatically be teleported to the zone. Any players in the zone who have not been chosen from the queue will be teleported out when the battle begins.<br />
The queue system remains active for the entire battle. As soon as a player leaves, a new one will be chosen from the queue.<br />
Trying to enter Wintergrasp during an active battle for which you have not been chosen will teleport you out. Please note that, as you are now able to fly over Wintergrasp, you will only be teleported out if you try to land and join the battle.<br />
Level 80 players get higher priority in the queue than lower level players. In addition, a random selection of queued players will be taken from both the Battlemasters and the zone itself.<br />
The queue will accept up to 100 players from each faction, resulting in a maximum battle of 200 players at a time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Indeed.<br />
<br />
I'm just worried that i won't get a spot during the battle, my server (stormscale eu) is very high populated and there will probably be ~200 alliance queing (spelling?) before the battle.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
You'll still be able to enter Wintergrasp by yourself without queuing when a battle isn't currently active, so you can just fly there and do your daily whenever there is no battle on. It's just that if a battle starts while you're there fishing, you'll get ported away until it's over. But hey at least this stops the problem where one side can get tenacity just because the other faction has a bunch of people hanging about fishing or farming during a battle.</div></div><hr />

You could potentially not get into a wintergrasp for a long time. It could be months before you managed to get chose, especially on a high pop server.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
Months...?<br />
<br />
Maybe if you try once a day, 2 times a week. But if you are REALLY that concerned: there's ~8 battles per day, some of which will be at times where there aren't 100 people per side. If you want a spot, you can get one sometime...it's barely RNG.</div></div><hr />

So wintergrasp is nothing more than an bg opening every 4 hours. <br />
Just quit developing pvp content and focus on pve, Blizzard.<br />
<br />
Make it a true bg and stop pretending there is something like open pvp in wow.<br />
<br />
Ridiculous.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not sure if you are talking about Scryers US or not...but if that is the case I'll give you a pro tip. Anytime there is ever a concern about population on MMO-C I would be willing to promise you The Scryers is not experiencing it ;)<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong, I enjoy the atmosphere and the community more than the high pop servers I've played on, but I don't think we're of any concern for Blizzard's hardware department...aside from the random crashes recently :P<br />
<br />
If you are from Scryers EU I can't vouch though :P</div></div><hr />

I can tell you for sure, that there are way, way more people willing to do it than just 100 from each faction. So what happens to those who are left behind? A giant &quot;haha, you didn't get in!&quot; sign will jump out?<br />

I wanna do WG when I want to, not when Queue decides to. I got real life, and dont want to camp every damn WG for a spot. Morons, since they fail miserably at fixing the lag, they punish the players instead. They should ninja some more ideas of WAR, like stable servers which can host 300v300 battles.<br />

People, you all forgot that WG is used by players *not only* during the fight. It used to do VoA. It used to farm ravenants and to mine and to fish.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The &quot;solution&quot; is having half the people who want to enjoy the battleground sit it out. That's not a fix, it's a cockblock.<br />
<br />
They will hopefully drastically lower the time between fights to an hour or so.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
You misunderstood, it doesn't work like the AV system which limits the amount of people on one side to that of the other, AV will only invite a 30th person on the Horde if a 30th is available on the Alliance, if there isn't it won't let anyone enter beyond 30.<br />
<br />
However, WG will invite 100 people, regardless of the amount of people on the other side, which means on high pop servers you'll still get imbalanced fights, however the imbalance is simply rather limited now, where as previous it'd be 40v200 it'll now be 40v100.<br />
<br />
In short, Tenacity won't cease to exist, it'll still be there to make up for imbalances in population.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Only 200 may be allowed in Dalaran in 3.2, there will be a queue system which will allow you access to the city for 15 minutes. Enough time to visit the vendors and do the fishing daily! You may not return to Dalaran for 30 minutes, a debuff will placed on you.</div></div><hr />

I do not recall a time ever where I was in &quot;world pvp&quot; other than Taren Mill where there was 100 people per faction. Unless you also count the AQ'40 event and the world bosses for the quests... and we all know what happened to the servers at those times.<br />
<br />
<br />
They should ninja some more ideas of WAR, like stable servers which can host 300v300 battles.<br />
<br />
Yeah... and WAR is going strong with over 11 million people.<br />
<br />
<br />
That's pretty crap. Why not just make it instanced?<br />
<br />
They are. This is what you can call a &quot;soft instance&quot;. After the match is over, people are free to come and go as they please. You can farm the revenants for your quests/eternals. You can fish for your daily/feasts. You can still mine the area and pick cold flowers. You cannot instance a world zone as semi-important as Wintergrasp is. This idea is awesome... It's the best possible solution they could come up with.<br />
<br />
Well... that is, except for the suggestions from people posting behind forums that have very little knowledge on how the game/hardware works and what it is capable of doing.</div></div><hr />

Dummy, all these 11 million ain't playing on a single server so this argument is fail.<br />
<br />
At best there are serveral hundred people in the same zone on high pop servers and WoW still can't handle it.<br />
<br />
War might have less subscribers but has even less servers, so it might even be true, that it's more stable.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lilbandit</div><div class="date">2009-06-20, 11:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">as usual from Blizzard, a terrible change to a problem they couldn't be bothered to spend money on fixing.<br />
<br />
Reaons why Wintergrasp fails at the moment:<br />
a) Vault of Archivon - free epics - so everyone wants to do the battle, leading to a HUGE number of people in the zone<br />
b) Huge amount of honor, for AFKing, even more than AV<br />
c) Zone-wide honor and token system, meaning you can AFK and clog up the zone, and still get good rewards<br />
d) [Most important one] A ridiculously badly designed zone, with 1 choke point to win the battle, leading to an enourmous number of players in 1 tiny area<br />
<br />
All the above is fine if Blizzard fixes the problem with the lag, but they couldn't be bothered to put a proper solution to it, so they thought they'd just nerf it into oblivion so nobody bothers to go there any more. TBH though, there will be no reason to go to wintergrasp after 3.2, so tbh this change isn't even needed. <br />
<br />
a) free T8.5 makes VoA pretty pointless (random drop rate is just too low to bother with)<br />
b) Wintergrasp pvp items are outdated and are crap compared to Season 7 gear<br />
c) No 2v2 arena bracket (effectively) will remove probably at least 25% of the PvPers from the game. I know I'll be stopping arena, as I just don't have the game time to play 3v3 and 5v5 matches (matches take same time, but organising is much harder). Also FoTM rerollers wont pvp anymore, resulting in fewer people bothering with the zone. <br />
<br />
All in all, Blizzard are killing off the most successful thing they ever implemented in this game.<br />
<br />
Now, that's Blizzard logic for you.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brasko</div><div class="date">2009-06-20, 11:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This soft instancing thing is nice, but at the same time, part of me prefers it was just a traditional battleground and something like 80 v. 80.<br />
<br />
1. WG only happens every 2.5 hours. If you're waiting and waiting and waiting for WG battles and you don't get selected, you're out of luck. No WG marks for you.<br />
<br />
2. If you're going to make people enter a queue it might as well be a full and independent instance. Wintergrasp was a great idea. Unfortunately, the technology isn't available to Blizzard to pull it off and support the scale of players interested. Not your fault, Blizzard, but making more and more restrictive changes to it every patch is quickly ruining the idea of a &quot;persistent world PvP zone&quot;. What players who ask for world PvP mean is not that they want to take a portal to a zone designed for PvWall combat every 2.5 hours.<br />
<br />
3. Some servers still experience lag even when there are only 2 or so raid groups on either side. 100 v 100 isn't that restrictive for some realms, but it's restrictive for larger realms and probably won't make that much of a difference for lag in and outside the zone.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah it's something, like blowing your leg off with a shotgun is something to cure an ingrown toenail.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Incorrect, and shows just how much people on forums tend not to understand the ways in which networking and servers actually operate. <br />
<br />
In the above quote there is a specific tool to deal with the problem, a set of nail clippers.<br />
Here, it's not so clear cut. There is no &quot;magic code&quot; that they can implement to make lag go away. You have to make your own tool most of the time, or else you don't have the right to be called a DEVELOPER. Don't give me the excuse that &quot;it's what they are paid to do&quot;, because quite frankly, they are trying their best here to alleviate problems. This may be just a temporary solution till they can get things worked out. Maybe they don't have other options. So it's either try this change and see how it goes, or do nothing at all and listen to people QQ to &quot;fix WG plz Blizz, gg&quot;.<br />

<br />
I hope blizz learns from this and makes people spread more in new battle grounds to prevent lag.<br />
<br />
<br />
New servers. They said themselves they need new servers but it's a process that takes a lot of time, and a lot of time is something Blizzard doesn't want to deal with. They just use band-aid fixes.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">perera</div><div class="date">2009-06-20, 11:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I totally agree with Brasko...<br />
<br />
I think limiting the ammount of people in the zone goes against the whole 'world pvp' idea that was the reason for it's creation; also it's probably be pretty annoying being teleported around.<br />
<br />
A better solution would be spreading people further in the area, what causes the lag is people's proximity. By spreading people I mean of course giving more objectives within it the give them reason to spread out (a silly example would be if the fire elementals dropped a material that you can harvest and use on catapults during the battle).<br />
<br />
This cap is going to be pretty harsh for bigger servers, on Warsong-US for example it's usual to have 4 full raids groups of each faction fighting for the zone on peak times.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tablemaker</div><div class="date">2009-06-20, 11:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yay if your selected you have more chance grinding ores and herbs as less palyers are there.<br />
<br />
If you are selected you are more than likely doing battle. Not running around trying to find nodes.<br />
<br />
There is time in between battles where people go to Wintergrasp to farm. You can agrue this all you want, Wintergrasp is the single best place to farm Thorium. With epic gems coming from Thorium... yeah. <br />
<br />
<br />
So it's either try this change and see how it goes, or do nothing at all and listen to people QQ to &quot;fix WG plz Blizz, gg&quot;.<br />
<br />
There is no reasoning to these people. If 3.2 Wintergrasp was what we go at the start of WoTLK and 3.1 Wintergrasp was what we were getting in the next pach... People would be bitching about that. People will bitch about change... no matter if the change is for the better.<br />
<br />
Like, for example, if Blizzard announced they were going to add another currency to the game, Platnium. Then people would bitch about that because they wouldn't have &quot;big numbers&quot; to represent how much gold they had. They would just have 32.8 Platnium.</div></div><hr />

'Good, first come first server' is far from the truth.<br />
A person who queues at 15 of, has just as much of a chance to get in as someone queuing 5 seconds of.<br />
<br />
This change is absolutely unreal in stupidity, and it further proves my point of the game going to go downhill until it crashes and burns in a couple of months. <br />
<br />
&quot;The queue system remains active for the entire battle. As soon as a player leaves, a new one will be chosen from the queue.&quot;<br />
<br />
Horrible fucking idea. Cool, as I'm waiting around, the battle starts. 15 minutes in, still waiting, and my faction is losing terribly. Someone leaves, I go in, and get 100 honor and one mark, and need to wait another 2:30 hours for a shot at the lottery of getting in again.<br />
<br />
As others have said, I don't have time to wait around for another 1-2 battles, hoping I get in again, and then not. I like to choose when I want to do it, not some system choosing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The regs will be aware of the queue timing and should be ahead of the curve over the people who play casually and when they happen to have the time and see the WG trade spam so think &quot;fuck it, I'll go solo in a cat for 20 minutes and chase horde for some funz yayz!&quot;<br />
<br />
Yah, some RNG is gonna suck, but as long as we Regs play smart and are always aware of when it's on which for the most we are it could mean far less idiots getting in, and those that do should be trainable in smaller numbers because they are easier to identify and focus on.<br />
<br />
Having those people too stupid to leave the zone when battles are on because they wanna fish or farm nodes is a fucking brilliant thing, so this is a big plus for us. As long as they enforce AFK removal and allow someone in who is gonna fight that's so sweet.<br />
<br />
Level 80's get priority, again, a good thing and something we woulda screamed blue murder about if it wasnt placed into this change line up.<br />
<br />
I am playing devils advocate here in a way but I do see these changes &quot;Mostly&quot; as positive, or see the silver lining beneath. At least they have listened to some of the user comments made for the last few months and have tried to impliment them in a way to try and fix the issue of lag without just keeping doing silly fixes that no-one even thinks will work and low and behold they don't, these may help a great deal. &amp; don't forget, they may still fine tune them for a few patches afterwards once they have been tried and tested live and can see how the full effect this next batch will have.</div></div><hr />

Those are the ONLY things WG is there for outside the battle.<br />
VoA could easily be accessed from alliance and horde portals in Dalaran when they hold the fort. You don't need to travel there since it's an instance anyhow...<br />
<br />
WG as an area is totally unused if you discount the above things.<br />
But still they want to keep WG 'open'.<br />
The bg should have been instanced from the start.<br />
But now they are to proud to back down, they don't want to admit that they have a big useless spot on the map causing them problems every 2,5 hours...<br />
WG was sold as a big open pvp battlefield, and it turned out to be another simpletons zerg, but with so much lagg their servers explode.<br />
<br />
Their new massive scale bg is coming.<br />
Seeing how they destroyed everything that was fun in AV first. Not talking endless battles but gathering resourcess etc, there was a MIDDLE ROAD possible in AV, but they decided to make it a mindless litlle pve rush.<br />
They gave us vehicles in SotA, and sadly enough it was totally simplistic again.<br />
<br />
They promised us the best bg ever with WG.<br />
Sorry: it's SotA without the beach. <br />
Flying vehicles?<br />
Massive player fights? Or you must mean 50 players waiting on a DK to grip one clothy from the walls and jumping him. Not knowing if they even killed him or he was already dead, because of the lag...<br />
<br />
They can't handle WG as a zone at all, and every change they make is simply saying: WE messed up, but YOU will pay for it.<br />
<br />
Can't wait till the first bg chat in the new massive battle: 'who attacked X? Just zerg the general noobs'<br />

Reaons why Wintergrasp fails at the moment:<br />
a) Vault of Archivon - free epics -<br />
<br />
<br />
Which is of course a lie on your part, and has nothing to do with reality.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
b) Huge amount of honor, for AFKing, even more than AV<br />
<br />
<br />
Which is not true either, you get almost nothing if you don't take part.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
c) Zone-wide honor and token system, meaning you can AFK and clog up the zone, and still get good rewards<br />
<br />
<br />
Not that good.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
All the above is fine if Blizzard fixes the problem with the lag, but they couldn't be bothered to put a proper solution to it, so they thought they'd just nerf it into oblivion so nobody bothers to go there any more. TBH though, there will be no reason to go to wintergrasp after 3.2, so tbh this change isn't even needed.<br />
<br />
<br />
We know it can take up to a year to buy new hardware for all the server farms and will cost a fortune, if the next expansion is close they may chose not to put the money there. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
a) free T8.5 makes VoA pretty pointless (random drop rate is just too low to bother with)<br />
<br />
<br />
There will be nothing free in the next patch.<br />

so really wont be that much trouble on my server, just dont expect to get in during peaktimes and do weeklies later.<br />

but on busy server it will sux the most for casuals who wont have time to play before or after peaktimes and if not selected... but since its now weeklies, sooner or later you'll get in ...<br />

On my server, Horde almost always have 3-4 Tenacity but it doesn't make up for a map that is won or lost by strategy and placement of forces (or lack thereof). Tenacity buff was obviously Blizzard's attempt to resolve the imbalances but just doesn't do enough.<br />

Having an open PVP zone is a great idea, but it needs to have some sort of number balancing. I think this is a great step in that direction.</div></div><hr />

Because of this huge number difference, many Alliance players never actually get to win Wintergrasp. Tenacity just isn't enough. It's great that Blizzard is attempting to band-aid two problems in one. One being the overwhelming lag on -SOME SERVERS; NOT ALL- and the other being helping alleviate some of the number differences. It won't completely remove the differences, because as some said, it just puts a cap and some factions can't even get 100 people in a zone. This is especially true for Area-52, where Alliance struggle just to get 1 raid group for Wintergrasp.</div></div><hr />

The patch 3.2 official notes have been updated with more changes to Lake Wintergrasp.<br />
Wintergrasp<br />
[list] The queue will accept up to 100 players from each faction, resulting in a maximum battle of 200 players at a time.<br />
<br />
LAME! Now defense will actually have a chance at victory!! The old system was working just fine! Sure there will be alot less people, but theres almost no difference between 200 people with a shitload of AOE, and 300 people with a shitload of AOE. Either way your fucked. Thanks for making things more difficult than they need to be. And still not fixing the lag problem.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Yep, this change is just making it a BG that's not instanced. Kinda lame. It was almost world pvpish before this due to the fact that you could just hang out there and the fight would start.<br />
<br />
I wish they would re-revamp WG and make it a true World PVP spot somehow...let people fly in, run in, swim in, do whatever. Kinda like Hillsbrad VS Southshore days. If lag is a problem, just leave it capped at 200, but don't do all this queue mubo jumbo.</div></div><hr />

On Misha we see around 2 full groups per side.That is 160 people and it lags like hell when the fighting starts at the fortress itself.<br />
<br />
160 people all AOE'ing still lags the game out so 200 people will still lag out the game like it does now.Nothing will change at all.<br />

&lt;sarcasm on&gt;Only change is once again the RNG is thrown into the mold and we all know how good that is&lt;sarcasm off&gt;<br />

I finally find a PVP enviroment I enjoy doing and I have to hope the RNG is nice to me now to give me a shot at playing at all during the week.<br />

<br />
Pretty much this. Usually there are about two full raidgroups on Ravenholdt EU at each side of the fense, judging by the Tenacity. Wanna know what happens when people start fighting in the inner courtyard? That's right. Lag. Lots of it.<br />
<br />
This fixes nothing. It is just an awful band-aid solution.</div></div><hr />

Yeah I'm also on Ravenholdt EU horde side. I rarely post on MMO-Champion, except when i'm shocked. Now is one of those times. Why not, like alot of people have said already, just make WG a normal instanced BG and remove the zone completely from the world and put some normal quest zone there now. It is absoluetly stupid to force people to que for supposed &quot;world pvp&quot; when it is actually now just instanced anyway.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Negatives: People who like to fly into Wintergrasp for fishing, mining and herbing will now get booted out during a WG battle. So you can still get it done in between WG battles, it just forces you out before a battle begins. And, then you can really only enter the zone if you queue up.<br />
<br />
Positives: Less lag. Less likelyhood of people sneaking in during a battle because they will automatically boot you out. <br />
<br />
I have to agree with alot of the posters here. Just completely remove Wintergrasp and make it a instanced area just like all the other battlegrounds.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Simple way to do this thing.<br />
<br />
Make Wintergrasp drop the most rare profession reagents. Titanium ore, Arctic Fur, Whatever the herb is etc etc etc. Obviously these will drop elsewhere, but at a much smaller %.<br />
<br />
Give the attacking bases quests (which can count as dailies). These quests are to gather resources. Once a limit on resources has been reached, you can attack the base.10 people minimum must be present to sound the horn of battle. MAKE it world pvp. Once they sound the horn for battle a 15 min timer appears. Then you que if you want to be a part. Crux is, while your getting resources, the defenders can stop you. It becomes world pvp, as your fighting to keep the base.<br />
<br />
I don't see why world pvp needs a timer. the attackers should decided when to attack. If they have the resources, they open fire. I would love to see it get redesigned so that NPC actually attack the base. NPC's use the Siege engines, we just defend it. Needs more...Ommph. right now its just same old shit. Needs more sub strats happening.</div></div><hr />

Except the times when you just take legitimate concerns for QQ. Because, let's face it, this solves nothing. Only adds annoyances. When 200 people will be in that courtyard, it will still lag. Nothing will be different other than the participant limit and the zone closing off for the battle. And the RNG draft mechanic.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So what do you suggest? Changing the cap to 40 players? It'll be even worse if nobody can enter. I rather have some lag and get my marks than not be able to join at all. I think they're just going to start with 100 and change it how they see fit. <br />
<br />
The changes raised a question for me. When we join to battle, we'll also join a raid? Or we have to form a new raid while we're already in WG? Or we can just form a full raid and then &quot;join as a group&quot;?<br />
<br />
Queueing up and ensuring I can join is much better than standing infront of the WG master for 20 minutes to get a spot in a raid and then having to wait while tons of people thinking its funny to aoe as much as possible, and then all those smart ass mages making teleports to stonard and whatnot. These changes are good, almong with the rest of the pvp balance changes. It actually seems the devs understand whats wrong with their game, so shut up and enjoy.</div></div><hr />

Maybe just maybe, and i know its a wild and crazy even insane idea, Blizz could use some of the Billions of dollars they earn, to improve the Wow engine, because lets face it, its getting old and dying in terms of performance, because it doesnt support alot of new features, i can run Crysis at max in 1680x1050 on a 4870x2 for crist sakes, better than in most zones in Northrend just flying around, often going below 15fps.<br />
<br />
<br />
So Blizzard sshould decide now if wow shall live or their new mmo shall live, because it will take people and money to update the engine.<br />
<br />
Same with the crap with additional instances cannot be launched. Again bring forth the big wallet, all those money, Blizz is getting greedy and cheap, just wanting to keep the game on life support it seems.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Failure.<br />
<br />
For the record, I am not a kid. Funny assumption though. I guess quoting and editing is childish nowadays.<br />
<br />
However, I did not 'cry' about those who *cough* &quot;actually realize that its BS&quot;, more like pointing out that people here cry for whatever reason they can.<br />
Who here knows the technical limits of Wintergrasp and how it affects the server stability? No one. Yet there's several muppets in here claiming &quot;Oh it would be so good and perfect if they did [change that completely ignores the fact that a server can't handle an infinite amount of information being transmitted]&quot; over and over again.<br />
<br />
Wintergrasp needed this because it severely handicapped the whole server during a battle, depending on population. My server has been near total disconnection because the onslaught in Wintergrasp were just insane.<br />
If 100vs100 still will cause severe lag (as if you, or anyone here, has any clue what is required to get the server to it's knees) then they'll have to lower it again. It's a compromise for overall stability. Deal with it.<br />
<br />
Oh no Wintergrasp is getting semi-instanced, as if anyone here actually gives a fuck?</div></div><hr />

But if they are smart enough to have created an environment (in hardware, network topology, etc) for the game itself for it scale really really good is another question.

You can queue up 15m before the battle begins. So you go to the master like 16minutes before the battle and wait a minute. I hardly believe as soon as the option to queue up is up there will be 100 players ahead of you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
So Blizzard sshould decide now if wow shall live or their new mmo shall live, because it will take people and money to update the engine.<br />
<br />
Same with the crap with additional instances cannot be launched. Again bring forth the big wallet, all those money, Blizz is getting greedy and cheap, just wanting to keep the game on life support it seems.<br />
<br />
<br />
Blizzard has stated numerous times that their hardware is the best money can buy, I don't know how you mean to improve the WoW engine to increase fps for the players, since that would require you to decrease the amount of data transported between you and the peer(wow). To decrease the amount of data transported you would have to make the wow graphics less good.<br />
<br />
Another way to make your computer not lag would be to reduce your video settings, of course.<br />

no its not<br />
<br />
blizzrd europe outsource the hardware to the cheapest bidder - blizz US also have the hardware supplied (although run in house) by the cheapest bidder - and they are fdar from being `the best money can buy` - bog standard bought 1U rack mounts with 1000 basetx does not make for imba server side.<br />
<br />
they run off standrad gigsbit switches and run at least 3 game `servers` off 1 physical machine.<br />
<br />
if they want lag free and unlimited instances they could have it , but that performance costs money and they dont want to spend that kind of money</div></div><hr />

Bullshit. How come WAR servers are able to host epic 200+ vs 200+ battles? How come I read now new engines are available, which move the server capacity from less crowded areas to where it needed?</div></div><hr />

Bull, Blizard would need to completely rework network part of the game to handle more people. <br />
<br />
As WoW started as pure PvE game in terms of mechanics, it's certanly not designed to handle that much players. Even proposed 100 vs 100 WG could be too much. <br />
<br />
Is it even possbile that Blizz would rework network part of the game? At this time quite unlikely. As a matter of fact I am rather surprised that Blizz did not address the network code and rework it either for BC or LK with far more people in mind (for &quot;world&quot; PvP). <br />
<br />
Probably its even &quot;harcoded in the game and such rework would require to recode almost entire game, which we just won't see until WoW 2, if it ever happens.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I highly doubt that. From what I have heard, one realm has at least 5 physical machines for the different zones (Kalimdor, Eastern Kingdoms, Outland + BE Zone, Northrend, Instances)*** and most likely another one to coordinate and handle things like chatsystem. I have no idea how &quot;big&quot; these machines are, but running several realms of the same machine is just out of the question. The machine that could handle this kind of stress would have to be so oversized that it would be a lot more expensive than a dozen smaller ones.<br />
<br />

<br />
Yes, that's certainly correct from my experience. It's entirely possible to be sat in EPL, but not be able to walk into Ghostlands or HS to Shattrath, but you can port to Dalaran, for example. <br />
<br />
Whether Blizz uses the best servers or not is irrelevant. I highly doubt they anticipated 11M players, many deactivated accounts etc. <br />
<br />
Yes, Blizzard probably could try and sort these issues out but let's think about this properly. Think how many servers there are (US and EU), and think how many servers they're made of (i.e. like Biernot said, different areas are &quot;seperate&quot; servers of sorts). Now, just the cost of replacing these servers and transferring all that data is one thing. They then have to upgrade the rest of the hardware so the data can be transferred between servers and the millions of clients. Then they have to make sure every server works correctly. They have to pay to have these servers installed, pay for the servers themselves, pay for the updates, pay for the developers to plaster over all the cracks that may develop within the code on new hardware, possibly pay for reimbursement to players in the form of pets or game time.. It's a hell of a cost.</div></div><hr />

sorry, boss... 450 fishing on 2 toons and 300+ on another... <br />
<br />
but as much fun as you seem to think fishing is... i would never do it for more than 45 minutes at a time... a 1/2 hour break at the max is not that big of deal if you seem to enjoy fishing for more than 2 1/2 hours at a time... heck, you'll need that break to empty your bags of fish...</div></div><hr />

Im pretty happy they put a cap on the limit of players in WG. Im on alliance side on Barthilas (US) where we are outnumbered by horde at about 3:1. Even with a tenacity stack of 5, and tenacity doesnt always fix the problem when 3 of you get jumped by 10 horde, we still get stomped when we deffending, and when we attack it gets pretty close, if not lose more than we should. I would say horde easily have about 250 (maybe more) compared to our 120 and the lag gets unbearable when we get close to the end(about 20 sec lag).<br />
<br />
This would come as a welcomed change in my view. Bring on 3.2!!</div></div><hr />

and have the system they just stated with the 100v100 and randomly fill the matches with at least 50 people on each side (if their is only 40 on one side and, lets say, 200 on the other it will only make 1 match with 40v100) that way they can keep the tenacity buff and remove the lag from the battles (and let the normal area be a reg pvp area with the bases being controlled by alliance or horde and anyone can be their but they would be in the Que for a wintergrasp battle while there)</div></div><hr />

People getting caught queuing up for WG then fishing through the whole battle are gonna get abused by everyone in the zone while they are there and for a long time afterwards. While this may not bother some people, eventually enough people will give them so much shit for gimping their factions WG Tenacity or chances it's gonna take someone with really thick skin to cope with that amount of hounding this would inspire, and it will be deserved I might add.<br />

Woah, like anywhere else when a battle is on in the place for one....?<br />
<br />
It's not like you cannot get any other fish from somewhere else that you can get in WG other than the Daily Quest fish, or am I missing something? &amp; in all seriousness, it is not hard to go to one of the other places that spawn the fish you can get in WG is it. The daily quest takes 10 minutes maximum, yes I do it and on 2 level 80's when it comes around but not when a battle is on because I know how much difference those idiots doing it affect my Factions chances.<br />
<br />
&amp; why not just go work on the Achie's you DO NOT have during the battles and allow us people doing WG for the fun, for the Win or to get VoA under our control the chance for that when we have that small window to do it without people screwing us over by farming or fishing?????<br />
<br />
We have to put up with the Arena whores and other PvP Honor leeches as it is without more people screwing our chances even more. &amp; if you are gonna queue up to get in WG once this hits live you should really look at what you are doing and ask yourself, why...<br />
<br />
&amp; as for your PvE life being dictated by PvP, wtf? You are fishing in an auto flagged PvP Zone... You CHOOSE to be there, and before you spout off about the daily making you go there, you can choose NOT to do it and have 1 day off and go do something else? We can't choose when the battles happen or who is or isn't in the zone. Which is a shame cos trust me if it came to a vote of people anyone caught farming or fishing etc would get voted out of the zone because you are the weakest link.<br />
<br />
I have an inkling you people do get why we don't want you there but you just don't care to bother yourself to do the sensible thing and go elsewhere for the time a battle takes. How and why I don't know because personally knowing I was messing up other peoples chances of being in a zone to do what the zone is for wouldn't sit right with me.<br />

Eve Online has hundreds of players in battles at the same time. No problems.<br />
I'm calling bullshit on that one. I used to played EVE (I played for about a year and a half) and I remember people crashing solar systems by sending massive numbers of ships into a system simultaneously. And although I never took part in any large scale fleet battles, I heard the stories about how lag slowed those battles to a crawl.<br />

Dunno about WHO, but if you think EVE's fleet battles didn't have problems then I'd imagine that you're exaggerating about Warhammer as well.</div></div><hr />

Currently on Staghelm we generally have 2 groups on the horde side. There are usually between 60-80 and we STILL have around 3-4 stacks of tenacity so maybe this will make it a little more even.</div></div><hr />

See, this just lost you any rights to QQ about PvP dictating your PvE life.<br />
<br />
You rolled there, you chose to do so, I'm now laughing my arse off at how you have the audacity to whine about the fact in this discussion. Don't like it, transfer to a PvE server, I'd even respect you for doing it if you had enough of your PvP Dictated life on a PvP server heh, just don't come to mine. :P<br />
<br />
In the meantime, I hope some of your Faction come along, see this and give you the crap you deserve for making their life harder to win a PvP objective on a PvP server because you are too stubborn and selfish to just fish elsewhere for the duration of a PvP battle. You should know better to be honest...</div></div><hr />

<br />
what are you talking about? since im on a pvp server i have no right to pve? huh? PvP servers are simply more fun. I like to pvp, i like wintergrasp, i like arenas, i like bgs, i like to FISH in wintergrasp. I like to make money to buy more fun stuff. I like going to voa. <br />
<br />
i dont like being told piss off because you want to fish in wintergrasp sometimes instead of fighting...and should be removed from the zone, or all the fish should be removed because apparently its 'your' zone to pvp in. maybe if YOU dont want me FISHING in wintergrasp YOU can choose to que up a bg...hear theres a fun one comming out next patch.</div></div><hr />

I log on at least once a day to do one thing...to do the fishing dailies on my 80s. If a wintergrasp just so happens to start when I log on, I'm not about to wait 1/2 an hour for it to end. It's poor design on Blizzard's part to have a daily there for people who will affect tenacity, but you can't blame the people who are just getting their daily done. <br />
<br />
If you're giving people crap for using the area with the best resources for gatherers then you're pretty daft. It's both a pvp zone and a pve zone and they have just as much a right to their pve as you have to your pvp</div></div><hr />

Wow, this is great, but I think you need to realise there are more advanced games for fishing out these days that require more than 2 buttons to do and are far more involved or geared towards someone with your tastes for gaming/fishing.... *shrug*<br />
<br />
Go play Deadliest Catch or something. ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
he has 2 80s with 350 fishin.......but doesnt do dailys....hm.<br />
<br />
and maybe instead of assuming im making a contradiction...think for a moment.<br />
<br />
its apparent that all your intrested in is fighting in wintergrasp. which is fine. but there ARE other people out there who could careless what goes on in wintergrasp, like half the ppl who are afk in dalaran. there ARE other people who just want to use the zone for resources, or dailys, or ways to make money.<br />
<br />
why does that make your interest in the zone more important than mine? because there is a battle going on in one tiny part of the entire zone? why SHOULDNT i be able to go there and fish when i like for how long i like...</div></div><hr />

and how are they alike at all?<br />
<br />
they are there collecting materials, playing PART of the game, in a zone.<br />

as opposed to people who purposely que up a bg to do nothing and gain rewards. <br />

<br />
of all the reasons NOT to make these changes... fishing is the lamest reason not to do it...<br />
<br />
and i agree with the above poster about taking out fish, nodes and herbs during the battle... same as they do with the elementals dropping the crystals... it's a 1/2 hour at the most every 2 1/2 hours... get over it...</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Herculon</div><div class="date">2009-06-23, 12:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a simple solution. Despawn the fish the same way they do with the elementals. That would prevent people from queing for WG and using up a valuable spot for a player who wants to PVP during the event. If you have a fishing daily or want to farm for your fish for your fish feast, just return after the 30 min battle (in most cases its much less). Surely you can find something better to do for that 30min? WG was designed as a PVP battle zone, not a farming for mats zone. So unfotunately for you farmers, PVP takes prefference in WG...LIVE WITH IT, MOVE ON, FIND SOTHING ELSE TO DO!!!</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I do the Fishing daily twice per day, I already mentioned this earlier so I am well aware of the rewards that sometimes come with them. I just would NOT do them when a battle is taking part because I'd be gimping my factions Tenacity count.<br />
<br />
You know why we want you out of the zone, it's logical for you to leave, yet you refuse to do so, only reason I can think of is being selfish.<br />
<br />
The fishing IS better elsewhere as other places spawn Fishing pools, so if you are after say Glacial Salmon then Grizzly Hills is pretty much the premo spot for it. So it's either selfishness or too lazy to take a few minutes flight to the best spot? Or you simply enjoy getting up people noses who want to fight in Wintergrasp because you can fish there...</div></div><hr />

Geez,. he just said he fish for the daily, not for the fish, and you tip him where he can fish for glacial salmon... Thank you, but I pay for the game, and if I have some free time, Id like to spend it on what I want to, not waiting on WG to be done.</div></div><hr />

Hence me pointing out the flaw in that illogical train of thought and reason for fishing Wintergrasp when a battle is taking place.<br />

So not only are they gimping their catch potential but also gimping Tenacity count for their faction at the same time if they are not doing the daily, which again could be done at another time if they showed a fraction of consideration. :)<br />

except we arent there for the token and free honor...what you fail to see is that we are there using the resources. we are NOT there to get minimal honor and a few measly wg tokens while we sit afk. if there was a way that we could be in that zone and NOT get honor or marks for fishing...it wouldnt matter to me.

Northend have other zones than WG!!! WG is a pvp area.<br />
I m the selfish? you claim to farm mines and herbs at a pvp/ no flying zone. Very produtive point of view, stop lieng and say you like the free honor and token.<br />
You cant afford wait 20 min each 2h30min of the game, but your act makes everyone else lag and increase of inbalancing on the fights. You are the selfishone here.<br />
My case is closed.</div></div><hr />

l2 read.<br />
1. ive already stated that this is the only zone you can catch ALL the fish you need for fish feasts.<br />
2. the increase of LAG has no relation to what zone in im...thats blizz's fault and problem...not mine. And what does that have anything to do with me wanting to fish in wg?...blow some more smoke out your ass.<br />
3. at what point am i causing an imbalance? (not its an IMbalance and not an INbalance.) your gonna tell me the opposite faction doesnt have players in the zone doing the same thing i am? Maybe the problem is the tenacity buff itself.....but that couldnt be, because your too full of yourself to consider anything outside of this zone belonging to only people who fight in the battle.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have 7 maxxed toons, all professions maxxed out &quot;in house&quot; and am fully self sufficient. All 7 are of a high enough level to do Northrend Cooking dailies and do, so heads up Mr Big Catch, I catch/farm all my own buff foods, cook them and use them. http://www.wintergrasp.co.uk/forum/Smileys/default/wink.gif<br />
<br />
Why would I rely on people like you who make taking Wintergrasp harder dropping a charity meal when I ALWAYS carry more than enough top end class/spec buff food that is superior than your KFC wanna be bucket? Simply put, I wouldn't and I don't. http://www.wintergrasp.co.uk/forum/Smileys/default/tongue-neon.gif<br />
<br />
I also make a killing on the AH every week with my Buff foods and left over fish, all without screwing people in Wintergrasp. http://www.wintergrasp.co.uk/forum/Smileys/default/face-of-ebil-eyebrowraise.gif</div></div><hr />

maybe you can catch all the fish feast mats there, but there are more efficient ways to fish those mats, then in pooless waters...</div></div><hr />
