<br />
You'll see the final adjustments in our hotfixes update post on Tuesday.<br />
<br />
In addition to the tank and healer trait tuning originally posted in this thread, we're planning to adjust several DPS-focused traits, as well as make a few broader tuning changes to a couple of specs. I've updated the original post with the full details.<br />

Patch 8.1 - Taunt Tooltip Changes<br />
Sorry for the delay in responding to this; I wanted to make sure I had all my info 100% correct before I said anything, rather than risk giving you incorrect or incomplete info.<br />
<br />
So first off: the threat bonus from using taunts is not being removed. That's a tooltip change that was made entirely for consistency; every taunt increases threat generation while it's active, but it was only mentioned in the tooltip for a few of them for some reason. So that's just basic housekeeping.<br />
<br />
However, separate from the tooltip change, we are going to experiment a little with reducing how big the threat bonus is on the 8.1 PTR. Currently, it's pretty massive, which is a holdover from when it was first added in Mists of Pandaria. Remember, back then active tanks were dealing huge amounts of damage (and thus, threat) due to the Vengeance mechanic, and so the offtank needed a huge threat boost to be able to keep aggro through tank swaps. That mechanic hasn't existed for a few expansions now.<br />
<br />
Nowadays, in BFA, threat is once again something tanks need to keep in mind, and that massive bonus opens us up to all sorts of wacky issues as DPS (both from tanks and from damage dealers) increases. As one example, there's a risk that we end up in a situation where certain tanks need to use their taunt on cooldown as part of their single target rotation. That would be bad for several fairly obvious reasons.<br />
<br />
So, we're going to try it with a lower bonus on the PTR and see what happens. Our expectation is that there is no tangible effect on your gameplay; you still use taunts exactly how you do now, and they have the same result.<br />
<br />
I'm a little confused- you expect threat issues bad enough with DPS scaling over time that you worry tanks might feel like they need to weave Taunt into their rotations because it gives them extra threat, so you're reducing the bonus, taking away an option to deal with that apparent inevitability? Are you adding something else? What gameplay do you see arising instead?<br />
If we get to that point (it's not clear if it'd ever actually happen), we wouldn't want &quot;use Taunt on cooldown&quot; to be the way to deal with it anyway. We'd rather just make sure you're generating enough threat.<br />
<br />

PvP Enchants Not Account WIde<br />
Hey there, as I’m sure some of you guys already know the new pvp enchant at 2100 is not accountwide, which seems weird seeing as every previous pvp enchant was made accountwide, I opened a ticket about it once I found this out myself to see if maybe it was a bug and the gm that replied said as of now it’s working as implemented<br />
This enchant is intended to not be account wide. Our philosophy here is that if you see a player with this enchant, you know they earned it on that character. We realize the enchant may of been account wide once upon a time and that other similar systems may be account wide but that is not our stance with this particular reward. Sorry for the confusion.

Cap'n Crackers (https://www.wowdb.com/npcs/138741-capn-crackers) now sits on your shoulder when you target him and use /whistle.<br />

Anchor Weed Supply<br />
Yeah though. Considering time invested people are not asking unreasonable prices for these pots. Something is very wrong with the supply of herbs to the market.<br />
Right now its the lack of Anchor Weed driving it all up. <br />
<br />
We've got a current hotfix in the works that should address some of the right now problems by increasing the amount of Anchor Weed per gather for ranks 2 and 3. <br />
<br />
In case anyone hasn't seen the datamining for 8.1, we're also looking at tweaking the recipe costs a little to bring the material cost of recipes requiring Anchor Weed down as well. This of course isn't final and could change, but just wanted to let you guys know that we're looking into these kinds of things.

Blizzard should also refund all the gold that people are going to use on rerolling traits after this and future nerfs.<br />
<br />
Personally I’m just going to use the non-class specific mid-range traits because I don’t want to deal with this “tuning hell”.<br />
<br />
A great example . Its 5 gold base cost. <br />
<br />
What a cheap noob.<br />
Literally every patch has tuning hotfixes this isn't any different from brass or cataclysm I know you idiots going to realize that tuning every few weeks every patch and RNG is something that's been in this game since vanilla</div></div><hr />

We now have a large selection of mediocre garbage. Every single time our BiS pieces change, so back to grinding it is. Thanks, Blizzard.<br />
<br />
Oh, and those Uldir pieces? Sure they're great as long as you're doing Uldir, but they're pretty bad if you're doing anything else. For M+ you really need other high level Azerite gear from Mythics. Which are now changing again. Can they not limit these major balancing reworks to major patches?</div></div><hr />

Those 3 armor pieces with wheel of Fortune just doing nothing in playstile and in dps overall. They are just harder to get with no reason. The same armor with secondary stats gives the same dps output if not to mention raid traits with titans, matrix and overall raid buff.</div></div><hr />

<br />
At this rate, they need to increase storage solely for azerite gear. This is WAAAAAAYYY harder to switch and transition. They're literally doing a majority of their balance through gear now. Not talents, classes, auras, modifiers, but by GEAR. Which can also be STACKED. Which makes the whole balance thing even HARDER.</div></div><hr />

1) it’s pretty expensive if you have already rerolled manny times.<br />
<br />
2) Adressing people as “noobs” and “idiots” doesn’t make your argument stronger. Try to be more constructive.<br />
<br />
3) Tuning in BFA is a massive task due to the Azerite Traits. Based on the numbers from this hotfix I would say Blizzard isno where near close to getting it right. They will need the whole expansion to tune these traits. They are adding tuning problems on top of tuning problems.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hyrican</div><div class="date">2018-09-25, 07:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">this is probably the biggest balancing nightmare they have ever introduced in WoW. ...<br />
<br />
Who knew that 3 items of stackable 2-3 traits of a selection of &gt;30 traits with effects increasing on item level at different rates and different diminishing returns would be a nightmare to balance?<br />
<br />
Each of them of course not generally better but different depending on pvp, raid/specific raidbosses, mythic+ with different affixes, specs, classes with common traits..<br />
<br />
Before you could balance a single legendary or a class set if they were the culprit. Could actually improve specific skills without massively changing the whole gearing thingy</div></div><hr />

If its too expensive then stop rerolling, what is so hard about it? <br />
<br />
Is it a problem to not spend all your money every month irl as well?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hyrican</div><div class="date">2018-09-25, 08:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">in one way it is a good thing they bring the traits closer together.. but then again... you could just remove 70% of the traits actually and it would feel like a welcome relief for all..<br />
<br />
You do not need 30 trait choices if you are limited to very slowly get azerite gear with m+ and low drop raid gear after a fast initial gearing of 340 ilvl azerite pieces.<br />
<br />
2-3 difficulties in 3 weeks + 3 weekly chests + bonus rolls + warfronts without an azerite piece is probably not very common, but it feels very bad to not even get a &quot;bad&quot; trait piece.<br />
<br />
Just remove half of the traits. They do not add &quot;flavour&quot;, they just feel like an f u from blizz after &quot;gifting&quot; you an azerite piece</div></div><hr />

I’m a Rogue and I play all 3 specs therefore I have to reroll my gear sometimes which is okay. But when Blizzard suddenly nerf stuff they “force” me to reroll my gear at high cost.<br />
<br />
Irl I’m an engineer so I don’t really have to worry about money.</div></div><hr />

I'll prolly just invest some minutes to farm new Azerite pieces - because that is totally how this works.<br />
<br />
Fuck Blizzard.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nobleshield</div><div class="date">2018-09-25, 11:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">TBH at least they're trying. I found it rather laughable that for most DPS classes the traits you wanted were never the spec-specific traits (the ones you would think would be the best) but things like Dagger in the Back and Thunderous Blast, while most of the &quot;everybody&quot; traits were pathetic and made a lot of gear little more than filler pieces at best, or scrapper material at worst because you got the wrong traits on them.<br />
<br />
The traits are cool, they should allow experimentation. But of course can't have that, only the best choice matters the rest is garbage.</div></div><hr />
