Legion - Arcane Hippogryph Mount<br />
Legion adds a new hippogryph mount that goes nicely with Brightpaw (https://battle.net/shop/en/product/world-of-warcraft-pet-brightpaw) and the Mystic Runesaber (https://battle.net/shop/en/product/world-of-warcraft-mount-mystic-runesaber) mount. There is no spell, item, or source yet, so we can't be sure if you will be able to obtain this mount. <br />

<br />
Legion - Fel Core Hound Mount<br />
The only existing Core Hound (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/170347-core-hound) mount was a reward from the WoW 10th Anniversary celebration, but Legion adds a new Fel Core Hound. There is no spell, item, or source yet, so we can't be sure if you will be able to obtain this mount. <br />

Blue Tweets<br />
Character / Items<br />
Can you guys please add Winter's Grasp and Flames to the Stolen Present? One chance a year is nuts!<br />
.Feedback received, they will be account wide xmogs in Legion, should feel rare and special. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/678006658639855616))<br />
No changes planned for this event? Gone through 7 characters and have neither, and never got Flames from Rag :-(<br />
We will continue to monitor the feedback (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/678007586734538752))<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
what's the purpose of making people start over with prestige levels? Why not just continue gaining xp/prest after 50?<br />
We want the decision to Prestige to be optional, but not trivial. If everyone does it, it's not nearly as &quot;Prestigious.&quot; (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/677296609340723200))<br />
<br />
Stay true to the idea of a tank being hit; make Taunt give penalties for not hitting tank, such as reduced damage dealt.<br />
We don't think the fantasy of &quot;I get hit&quot; works well in PvP. Prefer to work on the &quot;I'm on the front line&quot; fantasy instead. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/677564696514310144))<br />
<br />
Curious how you landed on 0.1%/ilvl. What was the target goal? Is 0.2% or 0.5%/ilvl too much?<br />
It's based on the full spectrum of item levels in the tier. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/677564898881089537))<br />
<br />
Looks fun!Will stat nullification(reallocation) activate upon entering pvp combat in open world or only in instance pvp?<br />
Only in instanced PvP. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/677565040728236032))<br />
<br />
Transmogrification<br />
Will Winter's Grasp and Flames of Ragnaros be xmogable enchants in Legion if you have them?<br />
Yep! (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/677570545928433664))<br />
<br />
Garrisons<br />
Anything that can be passed on about the 'Garrison Resources' that MMO-champion brought up?<br />
What's been datamined for Class Order Missions is very early dev. Expect quite a few changes between Garrisons and Order Halls. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/677297688837152769))<br />
<br />
Are bodyguards going to be in Legion? Please tell me Illona is a follower, somehow, some way! I would follow HER if I could!!!<br />
Some followers will have the ability to be bodyguards, but it may function differently to what you're used to in WoD. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/677297895553372161))<br />

Ghostcrawler Tweets<br />
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br />
Hi Greg, just wondering your thoughts; why do designers rarely make things &quot;Nintendo Hard&quot; nowadays? https://t.co/L1ILE4fcy9<br />
1) Game budgets are 1000x what they were in the NES days, so it's a big risk to have players not like your game. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/677132370491781120))<br />
2) Many games are so story based that devs and players want you to reach the end of the story. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/677132536837832705))<br />
3) The devs forget that getting better at something and finally mastering it is immensely satisfying. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/677132724268720128))<br />

He was added to the game, but isn't enabled yet: <br />

<br />
Actually there are none such hippogryphs (with updated graphics) available to all players in game save for the Emerald Hippogryph one which you can get only via the recruit-a-friend and let's be honest...I've seen one maybe two people on my server with that mount. So the argument you make for the core hound is valid for this mount as well...if not more.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would agree but I have my own theory on that mount. I think it was designed with the cash shop in mind. But due to the pressure of yet another 12 months+ gap between new content and to avoid people accusing them of only creating shop content they decided to deviate from their plan and included it in their 6.2.2 bandaid grindfest patch to make it look like there is any meaningful content.</div></div><hr />

The only 3 mounts on that list that shouldnt have been store mounts are fey dragon, grinning reaver and the iron skyreaver. This is because they look the same as ingame mounts and had reasonable factions that could award them.<br />

My only issue with her has been that every time she refreshes Righteous Fury (which is all the time) her hitbox grows massive for some reason and it's impossible to click on anything besides her until the graphic ends, even if she's been shrunk.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm not going to waste too much time on this useless bitching from people who don't grasp the concept of a business, but that aside, just because a mount is unique does not mean it must be a store mount. Every time something new comes out you all run around bitching, &quot;store mount&quot; &quot;WTF BLIZZ&quot; blah blah. There are 10 mounts in the store...10. The celestial steed is a reskin of Invincible, and the Iron Skyreaver has a counterpart as well. That leaves 8 unqiue (loosely stated) mounts; shit, let's for fun add in the deluxe versions of the expacs, that gives us 11 (maybe 12, idk if cata had one). How many fucking unique mounts (using same level of loose distinction) are there outside of the store? Let's start with every single Gladiator mount ever (18 and counting), how about all of the end game boss mounts(you know, like Mim's head)? As others have said there's the moose, there's the strider (now 2), what about the grand yak, or the first mammoth, what about the core hound, sure it'll get a recolor now but it's still unique, what about the vicious mounts? Galakras mount? The sky golem? (sure the fel reaver mount is the same skeleton, but each very unique), profession mounts? specifically the carpet and all the unique engineering mounts (don't forget the love rocket), what about the black quiraji mount? how about the seahorse? Ji'kun mount? <br />
<br />
It's almost as if you have no history to validate your baseless cynical opinion that the store is the only way to get the &quot;special super awesome mounts&quot;. I personally own most of the store mounts, I buy them on sale, I get them to collect mounts, that's it. (btw you can get the 300 mount achieve without these mounts) I don't even use them because they aren't all that amazing imo and maybe they have special effects but they are far from unique. You want unique? Go be a Gladiator, go be Fragnance and get the world's first Felsteel Annihilator, hell, just raid in general, go farm gold and buy mounts you can't get anymore from the BMAH. Damn, seems I did take time on this post anyways. <br />
<br />
Also, before you start bitching about reskins in general, and how blizz is &quot;lazy now and just wants money&quot;. There's been reskins since vanilla. Welcome to game (digital) design dipshits, you reuse basic structures and elements to allow you to actually FINISH what you're working on and to allow a base level of variety without blowing 10x your budget.</div></div><hr />

More likely the Legion event like WOD.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It doesnt really fit with the legion theme, i mean the &quot;fel&quot; isnt enough also for HFC the mount was, even if a reskin, themed because it was a standard horde wolf corrupted.<br />
<br />
But a Fel Core Hound is more a unicum event, like the MC 10th wow or invasion event</div></div><hr />

Because the other Hippogryph mount using that same updated model is from RAF, and they didn't get to release a store mount due to the lashback spurring them to add the Moose in-game instead. <br />
<br />
Not that I'd mine, I much prefer it if the store mounts are recolors of mounts you can actually get in-game instead of mounts that SHOULD be in-game but are only on the store.</div></div><hr />

Hi wise dude, which of those mounts is a new one? Which unique mount was created while Blizzard Store was already up and running? Got it now?</div></div><hr />

Gladiator mounts since, the moose, the yetis, the felsteel annihilator, korkron juggernaut, ji-kun mount, both deluxe edition mounts, the gronn mounts, the newer bird mount from Rukhmar, i believe the pvp mounts have been expanded....etc. I'm sure there are others. Stop your bitching.</div></div><hr />

Why should I care which one is new and which one is recoloured? I am a roleplayer and I love recolours, because some of my characters use special colours and if I want to fit a special mount into the look, a recolour comes in handy. I liked having more than one option of Nether Rays or Netherwing Drakes, for example. And while I am not into boar mounts, I will be able to decide which one would fit best to the look of my Orc rogue (who is an Outlaw), and not be restricted to the one in the game.<br />
<br />
Of course, new mounts are better than recolours in the great scheme. But you can only go so far with the approach. Riding snails would be very innovative, but kinda stupid. They could of course introduce some obscure mythical beasts from cultures not widely known to the public (how many people know the chicken-legged hut of Baba Yaga from the Russian fairy tales?), but not all of them make sense as well, or could be too ridiculous. And many of these attempts would boil down to reskinning an existing mount, because even mythological beasts either use a bird-like or a mammal-like creature or something like a dragon/wind serpent. Creating more machinery does not fit Legion, and rideable demons... idk if this would be that great.</div></div><hr />

Fel corehound = pre expansion event? Preorder gift that will be granted upon release? Something akin to Azeroth Choppers rewarding players that stayed subbed during a long no-content period? IDK.<br />

Why they still post GC tweets tho? This guy doesnt work for Blizzard for over a year now. Just stahp.</div></div><hr />
