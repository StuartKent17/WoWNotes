Remember seeing them years ago and figured they might be adding them. May as well spend time fixing text on non-available items instead of fixing all the bugs.</div></div><hr />

They are clearly trying to deflate gold and take gold out of the pockets of players. <br />
<br />
That is why I am going miser AF. <br />
<br />
The only mounts worth buying are ones with functional use. But now we have mount equipment coming, it trivializes everything</div></div><hr />

The scorpion is an actually unique mount. The lion is just a glorified nightsaber.</div></div><hr />

Between these and the frogs, they are probably not aimed at taking gold out of the game but to encourage players to purchase a token worth of gold for each mount. The price is probably aimed at a little under what a token value is to make it appear more worthwhile. In the end, it is just another pay-for-collectible feature that Activision is using to increase income.</div></div><hr />

The ridiculous cost is quite obviously aimed at increasing WoW token sales , Quite obvious also Blizzards goal and aim with BFA is do as little work as possible but get as much revenue return as possible, sad times, originally the PTR cost was 50k, which meant One WoW token could buy 3(on EU), now with the price hike and current Token sales price You'd get one mount per token, that's just greedy.</div></div><hr />

Every mount from every fraction costs tons of gold beside the reputation requirement. I want mounts as reward for playing content or achieving something as it used to be. One expensive mount per expansion is ok, but nowadays every (lazy recolored) mount is so expensive that a normal player can not afford it. I'm getting sick of this shit or should i say greed. WoW still requires a monthly subscription and this is why bli$$ard should stop treading wow like it is some kind of free to play title and monetize the shit out of everything</div></div><hr />

man your math are terrible<br />
<br />
If you could buy 3 with 1 token back when they cost 50k each, now you can buy 3 with 2 tokens. <br />
<br />
But 90k is just easy to make making food or selling mats or just doing some AH play. Isnt like crazy to make 90k ever day if you play the game.</div></div><hr />

Luckily for blizzard, token prices always stay the same so they can do what you're suggesting. <br />

Hmm, nothing wrong with my maths, PTR price was 50k, current EU token sale price is 172k, hence 1 token could buy 3, now with price hike to 90k 1 wow token can only buy one mount.<br />
<br />
How much gold you &quot;could&quot; make is not the point, the point is the hiked price is aimed at increasing Token sales if you don't see that your blind. Blizz don't set prices at what players could or can't get they base prices on giving themselves the best and highest return, its business.</div></div><hr />

Yes, very unique - like the scorpion mount you can purchase from the Mantid. There is no other model similar like the lion, unless you diminish it to being a cat.<br />

Thats not a lion model. Thats a completely different mount - there has at least not been any mounts similar to the lion mount sold through the store.</div></div><hr />
