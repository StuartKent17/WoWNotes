Blizzard released early versions of the PTR 4.2 notes, the first part is just link to the previews from last week but we have a few classes changes after that.<br />
Classes: General<br />
Crowd Control<br />
<br />
Many crowd control abilities no longer cause creatures to attack players when they are cast. The creature will not attack the player when the crowd control wears off, and nearby creatures will not become hostile to the player either. However, if a visible player gets too close to the target creature, the creature will remember and attack the player when the crowd control effect wears off. The intent is to make it easier for dungeon groups to manage crowd control assignments and pulling packs of hostile NPCs. The abilities affected by this change are: Hibernate, Entangling Roots, Wyvern Sting (will still cause hostility when it begins to deal damage), Freezing Trap, Polymorph, Repentance, Shackle Undead, Blind, Hex, Bind Elemental, Banish, Seduction.<br />

<br />
They aren't OP, they ARE, on the other hand, balanced around a powerful tool that makes them, in most ways, better than many other classes/specs (control). Frost is balanced around controlling an opponent and dealing comparable damage. This makes them extremely powerful 1 on 1, which is of course, not what Blizz balances around. On the same note, they are comparatively weak when put against a group of people who can remove their forms of control or heal through it (healers). This puts mages in a tough spot because without more control, they are medicore to good in 3v3 and 5v5 situations, and extremely powerful in 1v1 and RBG situations (where there is to much healing required all around for a healer to focus on saving 1 person from a mage). Blizz also does not want an arms race of sorts with control, giving class x a way out of control, but having to give class y a way to add more control to compensate. Because mages require decent damage to be viable in all situations, as well as control, they have the advantage when it comes to looking at a spec for its strengths. At the same time, without effort, they are also difficult to play up to &quot;high ranks&quot; because of the work required to deal with healers and such. Mages are OP in the sense that their toolkit is larger than most, and they are balanced around control, an already very, very powerful mechanic. Their weakness comes from the simple counter that a medium size team (3, 5) can counter the mage without a loss towards the other members of the group.<br />
<br />
All in all, mages are a tough cookie to crack because, without making them extremely under powered (and the excuse &quot;they were OP for awhile, they deserve it&quot; does not fly with any sensible person, and should not be used in any case pertaining to class/spec balance), it is difficult to balance them. A complete overhaul of a &quot;working&quot; system is something players (both mage and non) do not want. Mages are a very large problem for blizz, and although their handling of the situation has been less than perfect, it has not been terrible considering the mess that they have made for themselves.</div></div><hr />

I think the problem was more along the lines of a hunter using a freezing trap as soon as the symbol is up before the tank even switches targets. Every single hunter I've grouped with(guild or PuG) has done this. That's not an exaggeration. I think they're trying to kill me with stress.</div></div><hr />

Whats the story here? Shouldnt it be avenging wrath (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/31884/avenging-wrath/) rather than the beacon? Why paladin can heal people behind pillars with this undispellable buff (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/53563/beacon-of-light/)?<br />

Edit I think that the shield wall in zerker or battle stance may have implications on PvP. Specifically arenas. I don't PvP so I can't be sure<br />

<br />
If the mob is a caster it dosnt matter if the mage pulls cause the mob wont be moving, so you can still trap (I would assume a hunter would know if its cc target is melee or not). If a mob is in the way, you can put the trap on the other side and distracting shot it into the trap. If the tank charges the sheep, that dosnt stop the untouched mobs from still going for the mage, and if the tank hits it then thats their problem. You seem to be arguing that hunters shouldn't have to be aware of their surroundings, group composition, know what their abilities are or have a awareness whatsoever.</div></div><hr />

not that i'm going to whine about this boss, been doing ZA since release as a cake, even bear runs. but doing this with a tank + 2 melee seriously drained my mana when i was on my alt paladin healing, dispelling 3 people every 5 seconds or risk them dying once the stacks reached ~4-6 was very annoying. but overall not impossible, it just made the fight more challenging and engaging :3</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gamerunknown</div><div class="date">2011-05-03, 04:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">In a moving patrol of 5 mobs (say), if their hitboxes overlap, there's no guarantee the hunter will trap the correct one. For example, if the hunter is assigned to trap a hunter type mob and it's overlapping with a melee type, they might accidentally trap the melee type. The tank will then need to gain aggro on the hunter and line of sight without losing aggro on the other mobs attacking him, which may include other casters that he intended to interrupt but can't because he needs to get aggro on the hunter. Blizzard probably considered giving hunters targetable AoE so that they could accurately hit a stacking target by finding the nameplate and thus allow pulls to proceed in any order, but decided that the homogenisation would be unsatisfactory. <br />
<br />
Not to mention that if a CC misses on a caster, they might instantly attack the weak cloth char that attempted to CC them, doing some damage, putting the healer on the threat table, causing a melee to hit the healer once the tank has taunted the caster, causing the pull to be a lot more messy than: miss. Reapply. Pull. <br />
<br />
If CC misses on a melee, the time between CC being reapplied might give the mob time to walk into AoE. <br />
<br />
Not to mention this is a huge quality of life change for the tank, who can decide whether to charge into mobs and do single target threat, to wait on the AoE line (where you can safely AoE without breaking the poly, much simpler to discern now) or to line of sight without the type of pull being dictated by where and when the CC goes off. Life being made easier for a tank = more tanks queueing = shorter queue times.</div></div><hr />

There was only one piece of STR gear that was near BIS for any level, and that was the exalted hyjal cloak if you were only doing heroics and early raiding.

um really...? they just changed Fire nova so that it's a ton easier to use you can have magma out and CL at Mal x5 (noticed you're enh). If you're talking about a quick AoE burn then yeah i guess you'll need a different class, but DPS shammies haven't ever been about a quick AoE burn... thats more Mages and DKS imo...</div></div><hr />

Unless they're completly retarded ( the way you'd like it? ), they're not going to buff current damage without changing shatter and mastery.<br />
Just because they nerf one ability, does not mean you're supposed to faceroll stuff in DF even easier.<br />
<br />
Retaliation, Recklessness and Shield Wall no longer have stance requirements.<br />
Fail to see any change except for trigger happy noobs pressing Recklessness more often, and it being better boost for Arms PvE, which is something... barely used nowdays.<br />

Its a big buff to both PvP and PvE <br />
<br />
And alot of people are playing as Arms in PvE today , Fury is too RNG involved , as Arms in same gear i can pull around 1 to 2 k (even more sometimes with lucky Sudden Death procs) more dps than with Fury not to mention as Fury u are only good during Death Wish + Reck combo and after that u sitting on target spaming Bloodthirst (Boring ......)<br />

And i am still pissed off about UA change , instead of fixing the bug they are nerfing the spell itself , really smart Blizzard u never stop to amaze me...</div></div><hr />

Let's not forget hunter traps, which require one button press to arm, a second's wait for the game to detect the trap launcher buff, another button press to activate the targeting reticle, a second or two to aim the tiny, tiny circle in front of where you think the enemy might walk, a second or so for it to fly over there, and then another second or so to watch it unfold before it actually works.<br />

^ This.<br />
My guild master after reading about innervate nerf, aoe damage nerf has already told me I'm better finish levelling my hunter cause he will take shadow priests over me for raids.<br />
<br />
Thank you blizzard for making this game not Fun...Did you even know that a game should be fun ? I guess no... The next thing they have to nerf to balance druids is to Increase the starfall cooldown, nerf dreamstate, lower wildmushrooms damage and reduce lunar shower bonus.<br />
<br />
Change this shit to only generate energy while not in eclipse state or many many moonkins are going to loose their raid spot.<br />
If you are worried about moonkin pvp mana problems, even thought you nerfed teh only viable comp for balance druids, give us back the old good owlkin frenzy.<br />
And to control better the eclipse mechanic every moonkin would prefer someting to instantly reah the next eclipse rather than spamming moonfire to reach as fast as they can the eclipse.<br />
<br />
Exiting from solar eclipes after few sec in fights where the adds last much longer is not fun, and nerf the only thing where we were good. (especially if the lunar eclipse does not buff wild mushrooms, hurricane, typhoon, insect swarm damages)<br />
<br />

Not sure if you've actually healed the boss, but personally, I found it had unhealable damage with a paladin. With 2 melee and a tank, every single time it targeted one of those 3 they would take massive, damage and require a Dispel. If it was chained on melee/tank (very likely scenario), I was only able to cope with it through Divine Favor + AW, after that I was forced to let one of the melee die just to be be able to heal the rest of the damage. Not even during Blood Lust and using Sac+GoAK could I keep up, I just didn't have the GCDs. My paladin alt is pretty much in full 359 and has 1900 haste (rest of the group was in half 372) so it wasn't a lack of gear problem. Now I'm not sure how healable this encounter was for other classes before the nerf, since they might have mechanics better suited for it, but it sure felt like I had to let someone die to be able to cope with the damage on a Paladin. Now this might be OK I guess, since it was doable, however it probably wasn't designed with that intention.</div></div><hr />

i think it is already going this way. the remove of shield bash, and pummel in all stances. <br />

it is a good change imo, to remove all the extra quantity of abilities because of stance requirement, and make the action bars clearer</div></div><hr />

I'm not trying to judge the hunter trap. If you want to compare it to Ring of Frost, don't forget that it's our &quot;ultimate&quot; 2 min CD ability introduced in Cataclysm. Mages have already lost Time Warp in arenas. Now RoF is gone too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree with you that shamans (enhance especially) have never been very good at AoE, still, Blizzard said they wanted to roughly equal out the AoE potential between various classes. This has not happend in 4.1. In fact, AoE for Enhance got alot worse than it was before. We now have our main AoE spell coupled to a 6sec CD spell. This sucks. It honestly would have been better to just change the cooldown of FN and the uptime of Magma Totem as they did. Thats still not a good solution, but a hell of a lot better than the crap we are dealing with right now.</div></div><hr />

Ppl just throwing traps, sheeps and everything on the 1st pulls of BoT... the one where you need to wait the other trash mob line to move away from the one you'll pull. LOL...<br />
<br />
Always tought it was &quot;weird&quot; some of these mechanics (like hitting a tank non-stop while the healer heals him non-stop and the mob doesn't care, or other mobs around don't see you killing their friends nearby...), but this gets us to a whole new level... lol.<br />

&quot;lolololol dude, you got trapped... hahaha&quot;, &quot;hey guys, check this, he is a sheep now hahaha&quot;.<br />

Normally I don't, but i liked to have the option in case the other agility eq just refuses to drop.<br />
<br />
For instance right now i'm using the Bile-O-Nut strength/dodge heroic ring which is superior to anything else available to me right now. I'm also using the strength/dodge neck from heroic Atremedes cause i had no luck with Thralion/Valiona neck. Another example back when running ICC heroics i was actually using the strength mace from council heroic for a very long time simple because my agility staff just wouldn't drop for months, they are now taking this option away.</div></div><hr />

Its not to make CC easier, though it is a nice side effect, but to make CC pulls less daunting to new tanks. I can tell you from personal experience that the two things I worried about the most moving from normals to heroics was marking correctly and picking up CC pulls. The only time when CC gets screwed up is some noob mage who thinks its still cool to sheep pull. Sorry to say but hunters do the trap pulling now. Trap launching signals you to start casting CC and it all comes together nicely. Any other way is inferrior.<br />

I can see the incentive of the nerf; to stop Boomkins from having superior movement DPS due to Lunar Shower and Moonfire/Sunfire spam in Eclipse. But really, this is going to cost us 1-2 Wraths and 1 Starfire per Eclipse cycle, perhaps more depending on how our Starsurge procs go. It's absolute bullshit, this is what the third patch in a row where Boomkins get the nerfbat? While we might've needed it the first time, it's starting to get ridiculous.<br />

It's simply not worth the extra work to require certain stances for certain abilities and require every warrior to create macros to utilize their full potential.<br />
For those saying it makes the class more simple and destroys the whole purpose and thinking behind it all, no you are wrong. All that happens is that there is less delay and stupid miss-happenings due to faulty macros for doing stuff like all others could do without.<br />
Let me hand you an example, to play hunters the most efficient previously in earlier expansions ( say Burning Crusade ) you were to use a macro that had a cast sequence, one that you changed every time you switched bow. Was that something that increased the amount of skill required to play hunter? no it did not. And that's why a change was made.<br />
<br />
This is one of many good changes I've seen so far made towards the warrior class. One can only hope they retain the stances ( or change them to be similar to the mentioned auras or presences ) but add diversity to them through other means. The most similar example I can relate to would be druids, let's say a warrior uses his Spell Reflect, depending on stance and weapon it's handled differently, rather then require you to use a shield. If a Two hand weapon is used, only parts of the damage is reflected and the rest is simply deflected.<br />
If it's done in Berserker Stance parts of the damage passes through, if it's done in Battle Stance less and in Defensive stance none.<br />
<br />
If you use Pummel while in Berserker Stance you deal damage and can do a short stun, when you do it in Battle Stance you deal damage and Interrupt spells, if you do it in Defensive Stance, you interrupt and lock the school, nearly no damage.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
That might sound advanced on paper, but it really is not, there are different modifiers / stance, but no stance requirements.</div></div><hr />

Healers have no hit rating at all, so it's very problematic that the missed hits still set things in motion when they in fact need to focus on healing. The fact is that hit chance is not an element of skill but of random nature, which makes this change allow for more controlled circumstances than chaos by random chance. If Blizzard really intends for crowd control to become an active and obligatory part of dungeons, it's a good change.</div></div><hr />

A bear who's using a Strength/Dodge item right now is either gearing wrong or has had absolutely rotten luck with drops.<br />
<br />
While i agree that a similar item with agility over strength is often slightly better or on par with the strength/dodge(not counting items that also has parry ofc those are to be avoided) my question still stands, why is this change really needed. If it's to stop clueless bears to need on items with parry, well whats stopping clueless healers for needing on items with hitrate, or caster dps to need on an item clearly better for healing. Is this problem really so big that they had to destroy strength items being a slight alternative all together?</div></div><hr />

The change is necessary because Feral Druids are benefiting too much from buffs that provide both Strength and Agility. The fact that it will discourage Bears from making bad gearing decisions is just a side benefit.<br />

Nah they are not. Direct comparison between a couple necks and a couple rings, the differences are marginal you gain a little crit but lose a little dodge and vice versa, MARGINAL differences.</div></div><hr />

The creature will not attack the player when the crowd control wears off, and nearby creatures will not become hostile to the player either. However, if a visible player gets too close to the target creature, the creature will remember and attack the player when the crowd control effect wears off. The intent is to make it easier for dungeon groups to manage crowd control assignments and pulling packs of hostile NPCs. The abilities affected by this change are: Hibernate, Entangling Roots, Wyvern Sting (will still cause hostility when it begins to deal damage), Freezing Trap, Polymorph, Repentance, Shackle Undead, Blind, Hex, Bind Elemental, Banish, Seduction.&quot;<br />

The same thing apply for innervate, allmost all cd mages have, Warriors enrages, etc.. so yes you should also be dispelled if others play well. Just make sure you use your aw in right moment.</div></div><hr />

This change is total BS.<br />
<br />
If Ferals are benefiting too much then Cats should be #1 on dps meters most of the time, which is JUST NOT TRUE! Feral Cats already have bad damage scaling @85, and with this they lose some &quot;marginal&quot; AP (Horn of Winter ) and make damage scaling even WORSE!<br />
<br />
Totally unnecessary and until Blizz actually fix the issues that at lower levels anyone can NEED on anything regardless of armor type, this change (even if it is intended for lvl. 85 toons) is total BS! <br />
<br />
Do I need to mention that Bear's hits are like wet noodle? <br />
<br />
On the other hand this change is quite in line for Cata. <br />
<br />
&quot;Making retarded changes for retards, because making a choice, especially if it is a bad one is not part of fun&quot;<br />
<br />
Blizzard developers ARE CLEARLY OUT OF TOUCH WHAT FUN ACTUALLY IS!!! <br />
<br />
To make the matter even worse, the change is intended to make STR items less valuable for Ferals while at the same time they are making the real problem of damage scaling even worse.<br />
<br />
DO NOT FORGET THAT FERAL NOT ONLY LOSES THE STRENGTH BENEFIT FROM BUFFS BUT ALSO FROM FERAL AGGRESSION MODIFER OF +25% TO ATTACK POWER AND FROM A TALENT HEART OF THE WILD (+10%) - TOTAL AP MODIFIER FOR CAT FORM IS +37,5%!!!</div></div><hr />

Communication was important, timing was important, knowing your own and the other players' abilities was important. I can't even imagine playing my mage without the ability to sheep-pull...

<br />
I am aware of all of the above, thanks.<br />
<br />
The bottom line is, anyone using a Strength item/gem/enchant for either Cat or Bear when there are Agility alternatives available simply doesn't know how to gear a Feral (or has horrible luck with drops, or is lazy). Period. There is no valid argument against this.<br />
<br />
Cats are great in heroics and normal raids as far as DPS. They are going to have serious scaling issues, this is true. But that has nothing to do with Strength, it has to do with scaling. They need to fix the scaling issues, sure. But those have NOTHING to do with Strength.<br />
<br />
Bears hit like a wet noodle? LOL.<br />

<br />

<br />
Yes, they are. An epic 359 item with Agility is MUCH better than an epic 359 item with Strength/Dodge.<br />
<br />
Why?<br />
<br />
They have the same amount of Stamina.<br />
They have the same amount of Agility/Strength.<br />
<br />
So what does the Strength get you? Some AP that will make your Savage Defense shields absorb slightly more damage.<br />
The Agility gets you the same amount of AP, PLUS a bunch of crit so Savage Defense procs more, PLUS a bunch of Dodge.<br />
<br />
What about secondary Stats?<br />
The Strength item has Dodge. This is good.<br />
The Strength item has one other threat stat (often expertise, hit or mastery). Can you reforge any of these into dodge? No.<br />
<br />
The Agility item doesn't have dodge. It has two threat stats. Can you reforge one of these into dodge? YES.<br />
<br />
The dodge you get from Agility plus the dodge you get from reforging is always higher than the dodge you get from the Dodge stat on a Strength item. Always, without exception. So, an Agility item compares to a Strength/Dodge item like this:<br />
<br />
1. More Dodge (Agility + reforged Dodge &gt; Dodge on a strength item)<br />
2. The same amount of AP<br />
3. More Crit (more Savage Defense procs)<br />
4. More non-dodge secondary stats. This can equal better savage defense procs (Mastery), more frequent savage defense procs (Crit and Haste), more threat (Crit, Haste, Hit, Expertise)<br />
5. Socket bonuses. What's the best stat for a Bear? Agility, by far. Nothing else even comes close. Do Strength items get Agility socket bonuses? No. Never, ever. Do Agility items get Agility socket bonuses? Yes, fairly often.<br />
<br />
So, yeah. Agility items are better in every single category than equivalent Strength/Dodge items are. It's not even close.<br />
<br />
Think of it this way: A bear using a Str/Dodge neck instead of an Agility neck is WORSE than a bear using an Agility neck with a socket in it and sticking in a Spirit gem. Yes, the difference is that big. You'd be better off using an Agility neck with a Spirit gem in it over a Strength/Dodge neck with a good gem.</div></div><hr />

This.<br />
<br />
Consider two iLvL 359 rings that I believe fit what your trying to get at...<br />
<br />
Earthen Ring exalted rep ring &quot;Signet of the Elder Council&quot;:<br />
190 Agi -&gt; .78% Dodge<br />
Reforge Haste to Dodge you get<br />
50.8 Dodge Rating -&gt; .29% Dodge (rounded)<br />
<br />
Ending relevant stats being:<br />
380 AP<br />
286 Stam<br />
1.07% Dodge<br />
127 Mastery Rating<br />
.58% Crit<br />
76.2 Haste Rating<br />
<br />
1250 Valor Point &quot;Ring of the Battle Anthem&quot;:<br />
127 Dodge Rating -&gt; .72% Dodge<br />
<br />
Ending relevant stats being:<br />
380 AP (190 AP post patch)<br />
286 Stam<br />
.72% Dodge<br />
127 Mastery<br />
<br />
Same goes for same iLvl neck pieces... that is if my math is correct for the Agi -&gt; dodge conversions and such :p</div></div><hr />
