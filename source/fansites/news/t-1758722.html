Patch 6.2 - Alt Catch Up<br />
It looks like it may be a little bit easier to catch up on alts in Patch 6.2.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2015/april/altCatchUp.png (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/588106806599294977) <br />

<br />
Patch 6.2 Preview – Timewalking<br />
You may remember Timewalker dungeons from when they first appeared in Patch 5.4 (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3491-Character-Level-Scaling-Feature-Connected-Realm-Updates-and-Feedback-Blue-Tweets). They are finally here as a weekend event that reward scaled up versions of old items!<br />
As we get started testing Patch 6.2 on our public test realms, we’re looking forward to discussing all of the new features and content coming to World of Warcraft. First up, we’re excited to present Timewalking.<br />
<br />
In Patch 6.2, we’re introducing seven different weekend events that will run from noon Friday through noon Monday every week. Two of those events will be Timewalking weekends, in which you’ll be able to queue up for a randomly selected old-school dungeon with a new sort of “heroic” difficulty: When you Timewalk these dungeons, you’ll find that your character’s power and gear has been scaled down to a fraction of what they normally are. For the first time in years, some dungeons you outgrew long ago will once more put your skills to the test.<br />
<br />
A good challenge deserves a good reward, so to go along with scaling you down, we’re going through most every piece of loot in each Timewalker dungeon and scaling it up. That’s right, when you Timewalk through Utgarde Pinnacle, take down King Ymiron, and loot his Red Sword of Courage (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/127497-red-sword-of-courage?bonusIDs=615), it will scale up to an item level appropriate for use at your level.<br />
<br />
Over the coming weeks, we’ll test Timewalking on the PTR in the following dungeons:<br />
<br />
The Arcatraz<br />
Black Morass<br />
Mana-Tombs<br />
The Shattered Halls<br />
The Slave Pens<br />
Ahn’kahet: The Old Kingdom<br />
Gundrak<br />
Halls of Lightning<br />
The Nexus<br />
Utgarde Pinnacle<br />
<br />
<br />
Timewalking will be available to characters who are level 71 and higher for Burning Crusade content, and level 81 and up for Wrath of the Lich King dungeons. It will open up only during certain three-day-long weekend holidays. While Timewalking, your power will be adjusted down to the level of the Heroic dungeon, but you’ll retain all of your skills and talents. We will also be testing additional rewards, such as a level 100 quest that rewards one Seal of Tempered Fate per weekend, so keep an eye on the in-game calendar.<br />
<br />
Patch 6.2 PTR testing is underway! You can get started testing with us by copying your character and downloading the PTR client (https://us.battle.net/support/en/article/public-test-realm-region-information). Once you've had a chance to try out the patch, visit our PTR Discussion forum (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/17566180/) to talk about your experiences. To report any issues or errors, use the in-game Submit Bug feature (found under Game Menu &gt; Help &gt; Submit Bug) or visit the PTR Bug Report forum (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/17566181/).<br />

Patch 6.1.2 Hotfixes - April 13<br />
An important scaling hotfix went live yesterday, making things better for smaller raid groups.<br />
Raids and Dungeons<br />
Blackrock Foundry<br />
<br />
General<br />
<br />
The health and damage scaling of aspects of several encounters on Normal and Heroic difficulties have been adjusted to make them less punishing for smaller raid groups, to account for reduced availability of external cooldowns and the larger relative portion of the group that must deal with certain mechanics. Overall, these changes should make the encounters easier for groups with closer to 10 raiders, while having little noticeable effect for groups with closer to 30 players.<br />
Kromog<br />
<br />
Stone Breath now deals up to 20% less damage on Normal and Heroic difficulties.<br />
<br />
<br />
The Blast Furnace<br />
<br />
Foreman Feldspar, Security Guards, Bellows Operators, Firecallers, and Engineers now have up to 15% less health on Normal and Heroic difficulties.<br />
<br />
Blackhand<br />
<br />
The damage over time dealt by the Impaled effect has been reduced by up to 30% on Normal and Heroic difficulties.<br />
Blackhand now has up to 10% less health on Normal and Heroic difficulties.<br />

Patch 6.2 Concerns<br />
I'm always concerned that one of these days someone may look at the notes and be upset about a change they're reading about instead of logging into the live testing environment we've created--where they're able to try out the change--and provide the results and careful feedback from their experience. It's a long shot, but it could happen.<br />
<br />
tl;dr: Do your own job. I'm not doing the *math* for you. I'll test for things to *break* but not math.<br />
We don't want for you to do math. Why do you think we want you to do math? We really only want to hear people's experience from playing. Very rarely do we ask for math. It's great people want to theorycraft and they're absolutely valuable to us, but for the vast 99.9% majority we really get the most out of hearing how you feel about the game, and your experiences. Try the PTR and let us know how it went, what did you like, what did you not like? What was your experience? That's actually a lot more helpful to designers than an attempt to fix math problems, because the solution isn't always (usually?) to change a % point. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/368670-62-patch-note-concerns/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/16952246169?page=3#51))<br />
<br />
Patch 6.2 Testing Duration<br />
PTR duration is largely going to depend on what's being tested. With a new raid, a very large piece of outdoor content, quests, creatures, gear, itemization, etc. etc. as well as some new and complex systems, you can expect testing will take a number of weeks--potentially more accurately counted in months. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/368664-does-62-come-out-next-week/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/16951756138?page=1#11))<br />

Blue Tweets<br />
Garrisons<br />
Haven't upgraded my mage tower to level 3. I could, but two ground-level ports are more convenient than three portals upstairs.<br />
Good point, we'll look into it. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/585694825934094336))<br />
<br />
Holidays and World<br />
Question for the WoW audience as a whole: describe a memorable outdoor spawning experience for you. An area, spawn, or event. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/585695643437572097))<br />
I understand why these don't exist anymore, but long spawn contested PVE bosses from Vanilla/BC. Very fond memories + lots of fun.<br />
Like, green dragons? (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/585696661650935809))<br />
Obvious examples: Fel Reaver, Son of Arugal. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/585695734718169088))<br />
Less obvious: for me, OG moonbrook. First time I died a lot to dudes in houses, felt sinister. Felt more sinister with Stalvan Q. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/585695948073996288))<br />
Memorable 2: Duskwood, all of it. Finding Mor'ladim's Tomb, discovering the secret of Stalvan. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/585698102557986816))<br />
THERE'S WORGEN IN THE WOODS (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/585698184845996032))<br />
old Fozruk patrolling in Arathi, stumbling upon the old Scarlet Courier, Thrym being Thrym.<br />
He's the Hope-Ender. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/585705113186107392))<br />
but de world bosses, particularly de blue an' green dragons, held fond memories for a long time.<br />
*Nods Warchiefly* (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/585705216802164736))<br />
Also, those ghosts that spawned from the blood item things in EPL. And the roaming patrol on horseback. O_O scary times<br />
Blood of Heroes, needed to craft the epic chromatic stuff (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/585705877874876416))<br />
<br />
#Noblegarden Did you run an Easter Egg hunt this year? Was it fun? Did you get trolled by Painted Eggs? How do you feel? Get at me. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/585701357203652608))<br />
I went out to collect 100 eggs for the new pet, but that was it. I've already completed &amp; collected everything else in years past.<br />
.What would you like to see in the future? (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/585703348390780928))<br />
I kind of feel like most events haven't changed much in recent years. I say completely flip them up! New stuff!<br />
Woah, settle down. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/585705279846748161))<br />
<br />
I think I spend more time making DMF updates than anything else. There's something about a dark carnival that's just fun to design for. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/585694751451705347))<br />
I would love to see a raid in the darkmoon fair but I know its unlikely due to it being around only for a couple of weeks<br />
Like harder than the rabbit/moonfang? (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/585700129715412992))<br />
<br />
Holidays ever going to be fun and exciting again? Ppl who complete everything never have anything to do when it comes around<br />
What would you want to see? (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/585704951743193088))<br />

You mean a new system that is locked behind a only week end time lock, plus all it does is give gear.... wow I get all my gear from garrisons and raids now. getting gear is a joke.

I am hoping om something like 2 weekends with double the xp</div></div><hr />

<br />
so maybe once a month - thats not worth a month's sub. i guess it's to ensure fast queues by not splitting the playerbase over too large a spectrum of available dungeons, but even so, i'd rather longer queues and 24/7 availability over this system.<br />
<br />
very much doubt the other 5 weekend events will be enough to draw me back</div></div><hr />

<br />
Everything in an MMO is about progressing your character. And sorry that a fucking system being weekend-only is not what even one single person asked for. This is so much a fucked up design, you cant get it worse even if you go to the shittiest of shit JRPG games ever created since 1990.</div></div><hr />

I'm kinda surprised that players support Blizzard decision on rewamping old dungeons, spending less work on current content and spending less money on work, and still demand same amount of cash in return. <br />
I still have hopes for dungeons next to raid, similar to set of 3 pre ICC raid dungeons or pre SWP dungeon...went well with the story, great concept, beautiful dungeons before entering the raid itself, decent loot,...<br />
<br />
btw... sup with testing of token system... Will US be onlyone participating with this... europe time yo... Europe playerbase will probably give even better feedback on system then US playerbase solely due to people's diversity.</div></div><hr />

Imagine if they applied this technology to every instance and raid in the game(Maybe not the Vanilla level up instances)<br />
<br />
In my view Timewalking should be used so people can have alternate playstyles.<br />
People still ask for Vanilla servers/TBC servers/ etc. But what if you could just make a guild that focusses on running TBC content? If you timewalked all the TBC dungeons, you'd still get your rewards. And you'd get to run the content like you were supposed to(kinda) instead of plowing trough it like a hot knife trough soft butter.<br />
<br />
Think of all the newer player who skip past all that content,maybe only passing it once on their way to max level, plowing trough it smashing their best AoE attacks.<br />
Timewalking done RIGHT could make WoW the MMO with the most content ever, that actually mattered. People claim this nowadays but me ravaging trough AQ on my Shammy is simply not the same as taking a raid group and facing the horrors of the Twin Emperors.</div></div><hr />

I'd rather them add a &quot;Time Walk&quot; setting like normal and heroic settings, but with ALL dungeons and raids in the game, always available. Have them scale to OUR level, and rewards as well.

<br />
Do you even understand the resources this would cost? The guys doing the art of the new dungeons are also the guys doing the art of the new raids. This mean that instead of running a plethora of old content that just need number tuning, you'd rather have one or two dungeons that you'll get sick of running in days and lose maybe a wing or so of a new raid. That's absurd.<br />
<br />
On my end, I'm happy with the new timewalker system, though I would've preferred if they were mixed with all the other dungeons, all the time. Instead of running 9 dungeons, you'd have something that goes up to 63 dungeons. That makes much less repetition when you are trying to farm some gear on alts. Then after each patch, you add a new difficulty (like mythic) and upgrade the loot it rewards. This would be so good.</div></div><hr />

If you remember the strings and such first showed up pre WoD and people thought we were getting this is 5.4, so very little new development time was probably spent on this.<br />
Also as for the weekend thing they most likely want it to be special, much like DMF.<br />
And like I said when they introduced flex difficulty, this is a sign of things to come in the next x-pac. This will be used to gather large scale data and see how people respond and then the feature will be tweaked and released on a much larger scale (different random every day, raids, world bosses, alt leveling path) next x-pac</div></div><hr />

You really didnt even read their post, did you? Its pretty clear theyre saying they didnt get to experience some content (which they'd like to be able to see), and there is *other* content that they did see that they'd like to see again.<br />
<br />
<br />
Holy crap the negativity around here is appalling. Im actually pretty excited to be able to do those old dungeons again. There were a lot of really great ones in Wrath that are a lot of fun, and even while leveling you dont see very much. I didnt play much in BC, so it'd be fun to see those dungeons more as they were intended to be as well.<br />
<br />
Im a bit disappointed that these are going to be weekend events, especially with summer coming up. I have a busy work schedule, so i tend to get out of town on weekends when i can (so im not usually at the computer as much on weekends as i am on weeknights). Kinda stinks for people that have hobbies and stuff.</div></div><hr />

<br />
These are only going to be available during 3 day weekend holiday's not all the time, which is great from the standpoint that they will never get boring run them day in and day out. I been hoping forever for them to do something like this with older content. those dungeons in their day really were some of the most awesome dungeons to go through and really put a group to the test before they got nerfed or just turned into AOE zerg fest. I hope do the same with some of the older raid like the did with MC, though don't make it like what they did to MC for the anniversary, that was a complete disaster.<br />
<br />
They got far to much content out there not to take advantage of it. Yea, I best up on them for recycling and repackaging content most days, but as long as they are offered in a random way like this they don't change the existing dungeon and they offer some additional old content randomly throughout the year. I simply loved the BC dungeons and still go back and do them every so often.<br />
<br />
I get what you say, but as long as this does nothing to effect the current development and does not change the old on a permanent way. I am all for this.</div></div><hr />

What do you mean? This is much better. If they did what the community asked for there would be no need for new dungeons. We don't want another MoP do we?<br />

I'm holding out hope that this is a trial for something more permanent. I'd love the opportunity to go back and do older dungeons and raids at the difficulty at which they were intended, and I'd like for that to apply to any dungeon at any time. It could be an option when entering a dungeon where you right click on your portrait to select the difficulty level. &quot;Timewalker&quot; could be one of them. Using the LFR tool is another way to do it.</div></div><hr />

All you had to do on the healing drake was put your poison on the boss and adds when they popped up (multi dotting really keeps your health up), used your second attack from time to time, and heal an ally. So hard. The tanking drake you just had to use your AoE to kill the adds and otherwise focus on the boss while timing your dodge ability right. The DPS drake was the only one that required any coordination between people and that was just the DPS to do the time stop. Oh no, I actually have to talk to my group! Talking's hard. -_- Beyond that, you just DPSed the boss like you always did and killed adds when the boss was phased while avoiding orbs. Outside of having to avoid orbs, the final boss was only hard if you failed at understanding your drake's abilities, did not know how to talk to your group, or failed at getting out of things like fire (or in this instance, orbs). And people complain others aren't social. This instance is a good one to get people to talk to coordinate and people would rather run away than talk.<br />
<br />
I ran Oculus day after day for weeks trying to get it done in under 20 minutes back in early WotLK for the achievement as well as the various drake achievements. This was before Ulduar was released. By the time my group got the achievement, I knew how each dragon worked, and when LFD came out, I had no issues with any dragon regardless if I was healing, tanking, or DPSing. That's like saying the final phase of Malygos is hard. How is 1-1-2-3 hard? Flame Leviathan also isn't hard anymore. Get a demolisher and spam 2 until your ammo is out and then hit 1 if the boss is still alive. So hard. If your gear sucks, then alternate 1 and 2. I actually enjoy vehicle fights. Lets me actually do something besides my assigned role every once in a while. Variety is the spice of life and all that. I wish Oculus was one of the timewalker dungeons. That one I actually had fun in despite everyone who always left. It's a shame how many don't want to give new things a chance or even TRY. By all means, leave the dungeon and get the deserter debuff. As long as the tank and healer didn't leave, chances are my Oculus run will be done by the time your debuff is gone. Even if the healer left, chances are I'd still probably be done before you even get into another instance.<br />
<br />
I do find people complain about vehicle fights but how are hitting buttons on a vehicle different than a normal rotation? Only difference is you don't get your cooldowns and you obviously get fewer attacks to hit. With fights like Malygos, the main attack is no different than fireball, arcane shot, shadowbolt, lightning bolt, etc. The dot's the same as shadow word: pain, flame shock, rake, etc. Only new button for many might be the heal but it's just another button to hit and we all know how many buttons people like to press. Vehicles just simplify your rotation (for DPS) or lets you perform a DPS role rather than tank or heal, changes your character (oh look, it's like a disguise toy!), and quite often makes you more powerful. People should think outside the box or look at things from another angle rather than seeing something is different and run away with their tail between their legs. Play devil's advocate with yourself from time to time. I quite often do it and find myself proving the opposite point from what I started out to prove from time to time. Sometimes doesn't change my opinion on the topic, but does make me look for more viable points for my opinion.<br />
<br />
If you don't like something, ask yourself why. Do you really not like it or do you not like it because those around you don't like it? Did you even give what you don't like a try or were you just taking another's word for it? Did you give it a try multiple times over a period or a single time? Did you try changing up something and try it again?</div></div><hr />

Amen. But tech-wise it should be fucking close, maaaaaaaybe it's a step in the right direction.<br />

I really like the idea of going back to some of the old instances. And from the wording of it it sounds like it's limited to some instances each time, so you know what you're getting into.<br />

The funny thing I see of what you said about what Rift has is that then people would say that Blizz are being lazy bums again for copying an idea from another game..<br />
<br />
Also what I find even more hilarious is the intense hatred towards this patch that in all intents and purposes is adding more content than 6.1 did and yet people are frothing at the mouth while in pitchfork and torch mode..<br />

<br />
It would have to be at least 10 points below mythic dungeon gear or people will go ape shit that TW dungeons gear is bad and not worth it.. But in the end with all the intense hatred being aimed at Blizz over 6.2 makes ya wonder before Blizz decide that it is not worth all the aggravation and well you know..</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why not just make a game with one dungeon that you can run from level 1 to level 100 you say. well why not spend a little bit of time and effort into content that is already in the game, and make it optional for people to enjoy again without feeling it's useless? <br />
<br />
Do you simply hate the idea of having old content being somewhat relevant again? Or is everything added by blizzard that doesn't appeal to you is instantly costing you content? Because i seriously can't seem to think any reason of why you would be against this. (And no, again, it won't cost you a raid tier=) )<br />
<br />
ps. Don't speak in &quot;we&quot; terms as in you're representing the community.<br />

Yes I hate old content being relevant again because it is NOT fun. Its the same shit but just harder. I want NEW experiences, new lore, and new fun</div></div><hr />

Everything about this game has just been copied from some other game. Blizzard has no idea how to come up with an original idea. So no, nobody would complain. We WANT stuff from other games. The problem we have is how slow they are to steal ideas and when they do they butcher them and make them worse.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard are the kings of rehashing old content so they don't have to create actual new things in their games.</div></div><hr />

Don't really care about any aspects of Time Walker otherwise. I've been here since the last 9 months of Vanilla so I've ran them all when they were &quot;hard&quot; so doing it again doesn't appeal to me, but if the rewards move up to my average item level I could be tempted (without mutli/vers its useless to some toons), but otherwise time walker doesn't really peak my interest that much. Be glad for all the newer players to see how hard it wasn't despite everyones claims of the impossibility of dungeons tuned around having 5 CCs were, but other than that it will just be a heart break to all the old school players that love to lambaste the world with how hard dungeons used to be. (really we just weren't used to the mechanics, because they were actually new, and CC could make it as trivial as AEing packs are now)</div></div><hr />

Something interesting happening over the weekend, with old dungeons that I loved to do. Experiencing them as they were originally, the excitement of finding out it's a dungeon you really liked and then running it on all my alts. Maybe even have the drops be useful (for a short bit?). Fucking badass to have something from 'ages past' be relevant now.<br />
Unfortunately, I decided to not play games that don't have native Linux support anymore... (Why I'm still here? Maybe cos I'm still curious what Blizz will do with a game I loved so bad, maybe to find out if I'd find it worthwhile making an exception for WoW)</div></div><hr />

If the new system isn't for you then don't do it. Why do you have to complain about everything? There are millions of other paying players not enjoying your qq.</div></div><hr />

I imagine he just had them mixed up? Anyway, imo Oculus was mostly hated because people didn't bother finding out (or giving time to n00bs to find out) how those dragons worked. Whereas I was quite happy Blizzard tried something new there.</div></div><hr />
