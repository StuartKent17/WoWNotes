Successful attacks on Rageface will now always be critical strikes while he is channeling Face Rage.<br />

&quot;Incentive to explore older raids in the future&quot;<br />
Besides, there should be some added incentive to explore those older raids in the future anyway. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/185816/i-dont-understand-blizzs-vp-logic) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/2795074028?page=4#69))<br />
<br />
Valor Points<br />
That's a significant part of the thought process, yes. Also, Valor Points are intended to reward top quality items, and we don't think that they should be trivial to obtain in any significant numbers. Allowing them to persist in older content once new raids are added would defeat that purposes.

Ask the Devs #11<br />
Ask the Devs #11 answers are currently scheduled to be posted tomorrow, Friday the 15th. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/181708/ask-the-devs-11-healing-questions) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/2674982632?page=26#502))<br />
<br />
Real ID Party as a &quot;Premium&quot; feature<br />
I said this as a response on the blog and I'll post it here as well:<br />
<br />
<br />
We greatly appreciate constructive feedback about this, but as we mention in the FAQ above we'll have information about a cost for premium services at a future point in time. For now, all anyone is able to do is &quot;guess&quot; at what this could mean. Let's focus on testing for now and avoid supposition about any sort of cost at this point in time. It's too easy for people to get involved in hearsay that is inaccurate or misleading.<br />
<br />
We know people have concerns over this and get a bit itchy about the word &quot;premium&quot;, but for now the answer we can give is the one in the FAQ. Your constructive feedback though is helpful in the testing of the feature and will help us make sure it's serving the community in the best possible way. What we want to avoid is people getting ahead of themselves and guessing at prices or spreading misinformation or rumor. We want this to be successful. We want the community to find value in it being available to them.<br />
<br />
This is just one of several ways in which people can get together with their friends whether that includes them relocating realms and factions or not. It's simply an additional choice that will hopefully make your time in the game more enjoyable for you and your friends. It's not any more sinister than that. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/185792/new-real-id-party-available-for-testing) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/2838414159?page=2#39))<br />
<br />
Real ID Party cost<br />
In other words, we have not announced an associated cost with this at this point in time and it's free for testing currently. Anything beyond this is merely conjecture on people's parts. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/185792/new-real-id-party-available-for-testing) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/2838414159?page=10#187))<br />
<br />
Leading a Real ID Party / Dungeon Finder<br />
It should be restricted to you (as the party starter) as the primary Real ID holder and passing the group lead should not allow the other person to invite additional RID people of their own. That's my understanding of it and why we updated that question a bit to make it more clear. Now, should you find that it's working otherwise, I'd love to hear of it.<br />
<br />
Essentially, you as the originator of the group have Real ID. You have friend A on one realm and friend B on another but you're RID friends with both (they would need to have RID enabled too), even if they don't know each other, you can invite them because YOU are RID friends with them both. You can then invite additional people from your own realm (if you don't have any other RID friends to fill it in with) and go into the dungeon, or you can choose to enter the Dungeon Finder and let it do the work of filling in the rest of the group.<br />
<br />
This is my current understanding and it should be functioning this way. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/185792/new-real-id-party-available-for-testing) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/2838414159?page=13#241))<br />
<br />
Arena / Battlegrounds / Raid / Cross-Faction RealID Grouping<br />
This is as of yet to be determined, much like the requests for Real ID Party for Battlegrounds, Arenas or Raids. There are a lot of technical limitations to consider and try to work within. We'll keep everyone informed should any of these come to pass as something we plan to add as a part of the feature. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/185792/new-real-id-party-available-for-testing) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/2838414159?page=13#250))<br />
<br />
RealID Party and multiple WoW licenses on the same Battle.net account<br />
There's a known issue that doesn't allow the feature to be used at all if someone is logged into multiple World of Warcraft licenses on the same Battle.net account. It has nothing to do with inviting yourself, multiboxing, etc.<br />
<br />
It's a bug, and we are aware. :) (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/185910/cross-realm-real-id-no-multiboxer-support) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/2842434419?page=2#35))<br />

Divine Aegis using the Power Word: Shield Animation<br />
Divine Aegis using the Power Word: Shield animation is just temporary. The problem with the old animation was that Divine Aegis is used so much it caused for a bit too crazy of a light show. We love having awesome spell effects, but they can easily be overwhelming in a dungeon or raid situation with boss and player spell effects firing off like mad.<br />
<br />
We plan to revise the Divine Aegis spell effect in an upcoming patch. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/185906/divine-aegis) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/2842564560?page=1#2))<br />

Very droll, didnt they just reduce the gold looted from older raids?<br />
What can Bliz do? Add moar epic mounts in with 1% drop rate?<br />

Also, Valor Points are intended to reward top quality items, and we don't think that they should be trivial to obtain in any significant numbers. Allowing them to persist in older content once new raids are added would defeat that purposes. <br />
<br />
Right, raiding older tier raids for valor is defeating the purpose, while queuing up for 5man heroic (old content) and get the 980 valor cap without raiding at all is the purpose.<br />
FYI,<br />
4.0 5men heroic x6 = 420 (hell, its faster than the 4.1 heroics too)<br />
4.1 Z heroics x4 = 560<br />
<br />
Besides, raiding a boss only get us a &quot;significant&quot; 10 more valor than an hour in the repeatable zul' whatever.<br />
If you remove the epic loots in fireland boss, no body will raid them for valor because they are not even as easy as doing a few 5men heroics.</div></div><hr />

Because ppl would hang him up at his balls for saying such a thing at this point. Well played, sir. <br />
We want the community to find value in it being available to them. Valuable it will be... for you, if we have to pay for it. Less LFG tool usage for some. More valuable for everybody with real id enabled and ppl on his list spread across several servers for free. Are they that desperate to get our money if they want to make it premium based? Is blizzard having red numbers lately? How much are we paying each month all together? 100mil (8mil subs *12,99) ? And still they think about getting their hands on more of our money. Greedy bastards. Damn them because I like to play.</div></div><hr />

They are referring to t11 (4.0) raids, have a look at the blue tracker.<br />
5 men heroics came from 4.0 and the two troll heroics came from 4.1, so they are literary old contents.</div></div><hr />

Good job on comprehension. They are talking about old raids (T11 content)</div></div><hr />

(bold for those tl;dr)<br />
It is the epic loots that we are raiding for.<br />
We still raid heroic t11 raids, not because that 35 valor worth our time. Its because there are some epics are still missing for some of our raiders.<br />
<br />
<br />
then why does it say 5men heroics<br />
<br />
Their reason for taking valor off t11 raids is because they are t11 contents (or &quot;old&quot; contents).<br />
However 5men heroics are t11 contents too and they also give out valor.<br />
Therefore their logic is flawed.<br />

<br />
Because Daily Heroics have always offered Badges/Points. Why would they stop now? The reason they changed T11 raids is because they didn't change the type of Badge/Point they give like they did in Wrath. It prevents people from getting the next tier of loot from &quot;Old&quot; raids.<br />
<br />
Edit: Aslo if you raid what do you care? 7 Fireland bosses = VP cap. 7 Zandalari Heroics = Cap. You don't have to set foot into them because you get your points and your raid gear at the same time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
True, but the point is people can still get to cap with only heroics without raiding.<br />
With the 980 cap on valor, we cant &quot;farm&quot; badges like we do in TBC karazhan.<br />
There isnt a cap in Wrath or TBC, so we have to raid for moar badges.<br />
<br />
Oh btw, I am not saying I want valor in t11 raid or we get back to &quot;Hey guys and girls, lets raid Kara for badges&quot;. <br />
All I am saying is Blizzard's explanation of this matter is flawed. Thats it.<br />
<br />
EDIT:<br />
Exactly, it is the epic loots that give us (or at least some of us) the incentive, not the valor.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In TBS they didn't add better than T5 gear from badges till the Sunwell was open. So badge farming was for gems only. <br />
<br />
In Wrath they didn't make all the badges the same untill ICC. So you could only get badges from the current tier and the daily Heroics. <br />
<br />
I am not sure why they hard capped points, but those that just do their 7 heroics and call it a week will not ever out gear a raider. They just get the VP stuff and some gold from selling bracers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree. This is most definitely a feature that should just be added in for free. Especially when one considers how little work Blizzard has done for this expansion compared to the other two, I just don't see how they think most of us would want to pay for an extra little LFD tool.<br />
<br />
If WoW was a free-to-play MMO then sure, I could see them doing this. But with how much cash they rake in on a monthly basis from WoW-related paraphernalia alone? Not even counting subscription fees, but people buying the game+ expansions, comics, novels, mounts, pets, dolls, figures, clothing, posters, trading card game, and whatever the hell else has the WoW logo slapped onto it. It's just... disappointing.</div></div><hr />

It was worse in 10m mode. Last week I attempted to pug this boss figuring it was as easy as the first boss only to find that groups without enough AE dps were unable to kill eyes before getting hit by focus fire. The groups combined AoE DPS was literally below threshold when my Bladestorm was on cooldown.</div></div><hr />

RB: Exactly, and what gets people to stay on an mmo is that they are playing with their friends. So let them play with their friends don’t worry about it. Don’t try and make more Money.The main problem that people have with some of the premium content is that it says if you want to play with your friends online you better pay for the privilege to play along side them. I think the writing was on the wall for all these services when Blizzard put in character transfer fees which is the biggest joke ever since their is no staff input to implement a transfer unless it breaks.</div></div><hr />

Mobile AH is slightly different. Its not an ingame feature while the realid invite is ingame only. Its abit similar to shop pets and mounts, but still different. I cant find the right words to explain it. Will try it later when I´m awake.</div></div><hr />

Why would you do that? World of Warcraft in no way should introduce a premium service. Ok we put up with it now because they are minor but where does it end? I feel we could have another CCP incident on our hands (frankly I am surprised we haven't already).</div></div><hr />

Again with the people not understanding the feature or what it takes to make various different systems work with each other to make this possible. I see lots of people waving their hands in the air about premium services and how they already paid for the game and this should be free. I understood quite clearly when registering my trial account to see what the game was like, that if I wanted to play with my friends and boyfriend, I had to create a char on the server that they are on, failing that, I would have to pay money to transfer it to where they were if I made it elsewhere.<br />
<br />
This feature is not taking content away from anyone. You still have access to every piece of content new and old with this feature as you did before it was implemented. They aren't turning off heroics or offering RealID buddies different sets of content. No one knows what it will cost, or what features of it will even be premium.. but as you can see people are already asking for it to work with arenas, BGs, raids, and even making parties with people of different factions... but it should all be free right? You can't be assed to do follow how Blizzard set it up (be on the server with your friends, transfer or create a new char there if you want to play), they give you additional options so you can stay with your server/guild and still play with your friends, but you are entitled to it for free, because you pay your subscription. There are realms for a reason, but you all want the technology and ability to bypass them at no cost for playing with friends. <br />
<br />
I really hope Blizzard gets on the ball and implements ALL the things people are asking for, and charges for them, so people who feel so entitled to every little thing for free can just bugger off. I can't wait until you can do all sorts of ridiculous shit in PvP with this feature and see the outrage from it. <br />
<br />
Oh god oh god the world first races are going to be so fun if not only people from multiple servers can join raids, but both factions. That will be comedy gold for the raiding community and how much they love to debate on which tactics to achieve world firsts are legit. ~ Does vodka deserve the rights because their 25m was pure or the few guilds who joined together that got it first by stacking racials/classes from both factions and various servers? 15 page nerdrage thread ~<br />

You're missing the point. It's ridiculous to most of us because we are already paying $15 per month. The whole point of playing an MMO with a subscription fee is to ensure that new and improved content and features will be regularly added into the game, that are both better quality than and at a rate that is quicker than free-to-play MMOs.<br />
<br />
For an in-game feature such as cross-realm parties, yeah, it should be &quot;free.&quot;</div></div><hr />

There are realms for a reason. There are already ways to go about playing with RealID friends without this feature. Some cost money, some cost time in leveling a new char. Nothing is owed to you just because you already pay a subscription fee. They are giving you a way to have your cake, and eat it too, and you just want the whole bakery because you paid for a cake. You want the special frosting at no additional charge because you've already paid for the basic cake that every single other person gets for that price, but you want more and more, no matter what time or cost it may be to the bakery, it must be yours because you paid for that cake.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Your analogies are going all over the place.<br />
<br />
Realms weren't created to seclude players from one another. They were created because WoW is a hugely played game, and having everyone on the same server would be absolutely ridiculous. They're not &quot;giving&quot; us anything by doing this. They're offering us another option, should we offer them more of our money. $15 a month from millions of people should most certainly be enough for additional updates between expansions at no extra cost.<br />
<br />
Point is, as previously mentioned, they most certainly do not need the extra few bucks from this. There already exists the paid service to change realms, factions, names, and appearance. Blizzard is just scraping for cash at this point. Charging for this feature is something I'd expect from a free-to-play MMO, but not one that already charges a subscription fee. Content wise, this whole expansion has been a bit of a letdown, especially when new features are being introduced with an additional price tag.<br />
<br />
On Blizzard's part, this is not a good way to make your customers feel valued.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mmocf8675d1376</div><div class="date">2011-07-16, 07:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">From the view of a player, subscriber and just a consumer:<br />
<br />
The RealID &quot;premium&quot; feature is just a rip-off in order not to milk more money out of us, but to somehow replace the lack of subscriptions, which were lost in the last 2 months. Even if Blizzard states, that they only lost about 600 000, the truth probably is that they already have lost about 0.8-1.2 million subscriptions, aka 12 000 000 $ lack of &quot;budget&quot; monthly.<br />
<br />
Why do I think so?<br />
<br />
1. The Blizzard are now desperately trying to get more &quot;new&quot; subscriptions by lowering the total cost of expansions, more content for the casuals, much more easier max level gaming experience, improved (and perhaps even overpowered) Recruit A Friend program. Seriously, you really think that after almost 3 months of Cataclysm they willingly lowered the expansions total cost by merging Classic and TBC? Nope, they did this in order to replace the &quot;hole&quot; in their subscriptions.<br />
<br />
2. Well, pretty much Activision|Blizzard happened. Since they don't get additional sum of money out of SC II or Diablo III (You only pay for the disc), their only way is milking the Pay 2 Play game, aka WoW. Blizzard, however, remember their previous attempt to raise the price of monthly subscription ( which resulted in hugeeee hole in their wallet), so their only logical way is to create an unneeded feature, WHICH will be so wanted, that even if 40% of the player base would bought it, this resulted in a perfect replacement for the lost 12 000 000 $. <br />
<br />
3. The RealID feature is interesting, and also useful, when you are dealing with PuGs, which are just so annoying. Thus, this feature isn't a Core mechanic, because the cross realm gameplay is still accessible with LFD tool. Much like the mobile AH and GC, they are more comfortable, but you can play without them. But, if they had to choose between features that are not affecting the game power/balance, the development of a new pet/mount is just silly, since it only awards money once. Then we might have some features including improved Encounter Journal, which wouldn't be an increase in power, since it's only a little additional information perhaps. But they don't have the time to create something brand new. So they take and recycle (sounds familiar, wink, wink?) the existing cross-realm play codes to create a feature, which will be favored by loads of solo-typed players. <br />
<br />
Even thru we understand, that this feature must be a free service included in our monthly fee, Blizzard, however, won't listen to us, because they probably will say the following:<br />
<br />
&quot;Just like the mobile Auction House, this feature is not affecting your gameplay, you can still meet with your RealID friend in either RL or WoW, but without the Premium Service, the chance of clearing a dungeon in WoW with your desired RealID friends will be much lower, we just are offering you a more comfortable way of using this possibility. Also, this feature does not affect the late PvE or PvP content, since it won't work for gathering Raids and Arenas/RBGS.&quot; <br />
<br />
So game-wise, they just offer a new unneeded service, instead of a feature, which could improve the speed of gearing up significantly.</div></div><hr />

That and I already pay 15$ a month for WoW...<br />
<br />
Regardless, if BLizzard makes this feature pay-to-use, I see more people quitting WoW than paying for it. They'll lose more money than they would if they just keep it free.<br />
<br />
Also, that picture of the LK is awesome.</div></div><hr />

<br />
On Blizzard's part, this is not a good way to make your customers feel valued.<br />
<br />
I will accept the extra fee to group with your friends across servers if Blizzard lowers the monthly fee by several euros / dollars. And yes, I know that'll never happen...<br />
<br />
But are we entitled to anything at all? We signed an agreement and I'm pretty sure there's some clause in there that makes sure we, as customers, have the option to either take it or leave it. Despite all the complaints, regardless of whether or not they're justified, Blizzard has itself covered completely in a legal sense. If you want to make a point, stop playing. It's all these big boys listen to: a drop in income.<br />
<br />
I agree though that Blizzard is making some really weird moves here and I'm starting to dislike it more and more. Making money is fine, that's how the world works, but you can do that in a dozen different ways, and it appears Blizzard is determined to go the money-grabbing way. I also smell a lot of Activision influence though and I somehow hope the core Blizzard employees are at the very least ticked off every time they're told to announce stuff like this. I can't imagine Ghostcrawler for example jumping for joy at the direction Blizzard is headed...</div></div><hr />
