Fall of Deathwing Not Yet Available in Raid Finder<br />
We would just like to let everyone know that the Fall of Deathwing is not open just yet for the Raid Finder or Heroic difficulties. We plan to open this encounter up in approximately one week. We felt it was important to let more people get through the fights in normal difficulty, make videos, strat guides, update their mods, etc. before we let everyone take a crack at Deathwing. We’ll keep you informed when this part of the raid opens up for Raid Finder. Keep in mind that it’s required to complete the first half to be able to queue for the second, so don’t hold back!</div></div><hr />

It was a matter of time honestly, when you had to run around and save Thrall from the different elemental posessions, or how you wanna say it, when you were in Vash'jir one of Thrall's biggest wishes was apparently to be a father :) <br />
Watching that spoiler, and when Alexstrasza put her hand on Aggra's stomach made me smile ^^ <br />

Why strip the aspects of their powers? They are mortal now? So they can no longer turn into dragons? So Kalecgos was an Aspect for like 2 minutes and now he's just a normal mage, sucks for him. Nozdormu no longer can travel through time? This seems silly.</div></div><hr />

So wait a minute... if Nozdormu loses his powers, then in the future he can't really become Murozond, can he? This is ridiculous.<br />

Might explain why he's so weak in End of Time, that or it's a different time line.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">magicswordking</div><div class="date">2011-12-01, 05:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well the aspects were pretty clearly mortal already, considering that the existence of this cinematic is predicated on the death of two of them. It makes sense, to defeat Deathwing the aspects would have to pour most if not all their powers into the Dragon Soul. Its no crowning of Bolvar, though. Overly sentimental and Medivh did it better and classier.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, he doesn't. Since Murozond was his future self, this prevents it from ever happening. There's no paradox created, and if anything, all CoT instances should be removed from the game because the Infinite Dragonflight are never created.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Even though he isn't an aspect, he likely still wields considerable power. He just isn't a timeless being anymore.<br />
<br />
<br />
Likely whatever transformed him into Murozond also cranked up his power considerably and could of restored much of his mastery over time, though perhaps not to pre-Dragon Soul levels (hence why we can kill him in a 5-man with just a bit of extra time-power via the Hourglass of Eternity).</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have no problem with this ending, except for the practicalities of it. This implies the Nozdormu storyline is finished, and that the Aspect's purpose of taking charge over Azeroth wasn't really their purpose. Huh. This really makes less sense the more I think about it. I only hope this means there are going to be lots of plot twists in Mists of Pandaria that will somehow explain all of this.</div></div><hr />

Yeah. I'm sure that their entire purpose for existing didn't have anything to do with what the Titans wanted them to do. Nope. No, sir. Not like there are demons or Old Gods left to defend the world against either.</div></div><hr />

The Dragons are not going to instantly die; they just lose the power to stay alive forever. I think this is a great story changer because for the longest times, the dragons almost acted all high and mighty with their said power and NOW they HAVE to watch and be careful with what they do....<br />
<br />
Remember, the night elves lost their immortality and they are still in the game. The ONLY thing I wish that ending had was if we saw a little foreshadow of the bad things to comes (Na'zoth creeping through the water watching this all etc).</div></div><hr />

The only reason the aspects have lost their power is because Blizzard wrote that in. It's unneccessary and doesn't even make sense.<br />

Another thing. If it takes 4 aspects, Thrall, the Dragon Soul and an army of adventurers to kill Deathwing, how the hell are we meant to kill the Old Gods that empowered him? Blizzard has their power levels all messed up. THIS is all messed up.</div></div><hr />

It also make sense why it appears that they've dropped all other ongoing storylines. I will totally miss the Dragonflights but maybe this will be the beginning of something newer and better? Without aspects maybe Dragons are free to do as they please... playable dragons? I'd bite. I don't see this to be anything more then blizzard telling the players that this is end of all things we &quot;know&quot; about. Its time for the future. And all new stuff. A lot of fans of the older WoW stuff are going to totally hate this. I can't judge it though. I am looking forward to the future.

Their powers were gifted to them by the Titans, who are practically gods. Greatly weakened for a while, sure. But to have their power completely gone? No sense what so ever.<br />

Also, the &quot;time of mortals&quot;? WHAT? Are they implying this time they were in WASN'T the time of mortals?

Terrible, flawed logic comes from Metzen. Those are Aspects. It is ridiculous that even all the Aspects got pretty much sacrificed so Thrall could shine. Also, can anyone remember Malfurion or the Ancients? Ridiculous.<br />

They failed at portraying Deathwing as a true menace, he was just an angry dragon. Deathwing alone is more important to Warcraft universe than Thrall ever was. But we barely see DW, but Thrall is everywhere.<br />

No, I understand that, I just don't get why people think that the Aspects have lost all their powers, and things like Nozdormu becoming Murozond are impossible now. They're still DRAGONS. They are the top of the food chain, still (as far as the plot will allow).<br />

Nozdormu will no longer become the evil dragon we fight in End Time, so his death is something completely different, which I can only assume will be natural. I feel this as a lazy way to not find a new earth aspect, but we have one lined up (Kind of). Kalecgos gets 15 minutes of fame, which sucks because after reading Twilight of the Aspects I really liked him.

And exactly what so big did the aspects do to make their powers go away? even crafting the dragon soul didn't take their powers away so how the fuck would firing ma lazor beam take them? doesn't make sense at all.

Amazing. You complain about Rhonin and not Thrall who was RIGHT THERE and suffered no consequences. If you're going to go for a Mary Sue, he'd like a word with you.<br />
<br />
No, of course it's not fun if the Aspects come to save us every time. But if you're going to write them out, this is a TERRIBLE way to do it. Have them all die or lose their powers in interesting ways, not as a footnote at the bottom of a page. Hell, it wasn't even established before this point that an aspect could lose their powers. Even worse, the Dragonwrath line even established that you could empower a dragon to become an aspect. Why doesn't that just happen?<br />

Yes, a plot has to facilitate a certain direction. There's a right way to do that and a wrong way. What they've done here is a twist with no substance or leadup that contradicts plenty of stuff in the lore while introducing new shoehorned concepts at the moment of execution.</div></div><hr />

So stupid. The titans created the Aspects as governors of various parts of the world and magic. With them no longer doing that, the world will quickly fall into chaos as the Old Gods and Burning Legion take the opportunity to raze Azeroth to the ground.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheWerebison</div><div class="date">2011-12-01, 06:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So according to you guys, the aspects should have let Deathwing destroy the planet so they could keep their powers to... protect the planet? Not sure I understand your awful horrible terrible flawed logic.<br />
<br />
You guys lack the ability to grasp the concept that if they didn't use the powers to the point of diminishing them, the planet would be destroyed and they would have just failed their charge right there and then.<br />
<br />
I guess the Night Elves shouldn't have given up their immortality to save the world from Sargeras, so they could live longer and live in the demon-overrun world, too. *shrug*<br />
<br />
I dunno. It amazes me there are still people who play this game when they seem to complain about everything. It's like this game came out and punched their mother in the baby-maker, I just don't understand it.<br />
<br />
Also, whoever mentioned the thing about powerlevels. Yeah, it's a game. You really can't get up in arms about levels and who should be able to destroy what. We killed Kael in a raid, and he came back weaker and in a 5-man. We killed Anub'arak in a 5-man, and he came back STRONGER and in a raid. Sylvanas is killed by a single bullet. The most powerful shaman ever, the most powerful druid, the dragon aspects, Aggra, and your character are all stunned by 4 druids of the flame and Staghelm. The same boss can be killed by 25 people or 10 people. I mean, you can't look for logic everywhere.</div></div><hr />

It is not their fault, I would say. The 'new lore' after Warcraft 3 is full of lousy choices. Some of them are incredibly hilarious, like what happens to Varian and the whole wolf thing. It is garbage, and it comes from Metzen, not the players.<br />

I felt like MoP was the right decision because I thought that Old Gods were just being overused by now, and that it is too soon to hear from the Legion again, so having a plot that is 'Azeroth only' is rather nice. However, from the recent books and this travesty that is Cataclysm and its lore, I highly doubt they can create a good story for MoP.<br />
<br />
I wish Metzen would go on a very long vacation... I have followed Warcraft lore for more than a decade after playing the first 2 games. Seeing the current lore is... Absurd, horrible in every way.

Quoting.<br />
<br />
This ending is perfectly in line with the game. Cataclysm destroyed Azeroth and changed it completely, and i'm sure many of you will also say that cata destroyed WoW.<br />
<br />
MoP = new WoW. A completely different game. Many are scared opf changes, others simply cannot accept things that are different to their way of thinking.<br />
<br />
If you don't like this, doesn't mean it's done wrong. It's their game, and you have the choice to not play it anymore. Saying &quot;i will play only if Blizz does this and that&quot; is not a great comeback :) and referring to the quote, you're right. Many think that they have awesome ideas, but most of the times they are cliche/boring/badly designed things.<br />
<br />
EDIT: to be more clear, it's like you are reading a book. If you find it boring/unfunny/somethign else, you put that book on the shelf and don't read it, or maybe you try to finish it fast and then forget about it. I don't think many of you would go to the book author's house and threaten him with a gun to retire all current copies and rewrite it following your suggestions, neither try to make him write anymore.</div></div><hr />

Countless lore characters have proven with enough power you can still be immortal (see Lich King). Immortal doesn't mean you can't die necessarily, just means you can't die from disease and sickness most of the time. The Aspects purpose was to keep balance in the world. They needed 5 Aspects for that, with the Black's pretty much gone and Thrall not strong enough (Blizzard has said he's strong but not strong enough [no retcons yet]). So with no way to make another Aspect of the Earth they all had to relinquish their powers. They will however still be insanely powerful magic users though. Plus we have proven that we can over come everything that is put in our way. Algalon? No problem. Deathwing? No problem, Old Gods? No problem. I for one love this cinematic, and it paves a great path to MoP.</div></div><hr />

Agreed, but they could be doing to lead up to something huge and explain it all, Like the Aspects no longer have there power but the Titans could a merge and grant them there power one last time. Dunno though</div></div><hr />

A new WoW in gameplay terms may be a good thing but a new WoW in lore terms would be the single most stupid thing Blizzard could ever do. Not only have they not expanded on the current lore AT ALL, but by dismissing all of the established characters, all of the encounters and story lose all meaning.<br />

Metzen is not the end-all-be-all at Blizzard lore-wise. At BlizzCon, he basically said &quot;I want Warcraft to be more crazy half-sci-fi/half-fantasy madness and the other guys in the office won't let it happen&quot;.Thrall could easily have been... I dunno. Velen. Jaina. Varian. Etc. They could have shoehorned in a reason for these people to be important and cause the end of Deathwing. <br />
<br />
The point is that MORTALS are ultimately the true saviors of Azeroth. Thrall (and the dumb 'lol ur pregnant Aggra') was just a vessel for getting us to this point.<br />
<br />
That all being said, the current state of the world couldn't have come about without Thrall. Thrall has been, since War3, one of, if not the most, important characters in the Warcraft universe. I'm glad that his story is, for all intents and purposes, over. We've gotten proper closure on a huge chapter in Warcraft lore. Pretty big to happen in an MMO that is still going strong. Stop whining about it. You can get your Varian fanboying in soon enough when they start to focus hardcore on the Alliance coming up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's not like Azshara is still out there, or Old Gods, or fucking Sargeras or anything. Nope. Deathwing was the only good guy.<br />

anyway yeah it was kind a meh ending compared to the LK cinematic which felt like it gave allot more closure. I am not opose to the aspects losing their immortality/power, when you think about how they were represented in WC3 they have been INCREDIBLY over exposed lately in game anyway...its a good way so have them slip into the shadows a bit and besides....i highly doubt we won't see any Bleach style BS about them getting their power back in some way/shape/form. Also...how is this a &quot;twist&quot; really? I mean the Dragon-Soul taking in the Aspects power was used in WoW a while back, this isn't exactly new, its just permanent now since they had Thrall KAMAHAMAHA DK down.</div></div><hr />

Level does not equal lore strength. In the DW fight we have aspects, thrall, an army. When we fight &quot;Master Fumanchu&quot; we have us that's it. If that isn't enough for you, well go figure it out yourself instead of having someone else give you a reason.</div></div><hr />

2) Nozdormu lost his powers, so Murozond will never have existed, and nothing the Infinite Dragonflight did will ever have happened, so I guess all the CoT instances are gone, and in fact, we never even really did them.<br />

3) Thrall, the Warchief of the Horde, is now the leader of the world. And before somebody responds saying &quot;Yeah, but Thrall gave up the title of Warchief to some psycho!

<br />
4) Elrond and the Elves are off to the Grey Havens.<br />
<br />
And perhaps the biggest insult of all,<br />

5) Deathwing's destruction was wrought by Thrall shooting a rainbow sparkle beam at him, and he exploded into glitter. This is the end of the most terrifying villain Azeroth has ever known. Confetti.</div></div><hr />

In the DW fight we have aspects, thrall, an army. When we fight &quot;Master Fumanchu&quot; we have us that's it. If that isn't enough for you, well go figure it out yourself instead of having someone else give you a reason.<br />
It still makes no sense, even with the advantage we have. The end boss of MoP, which will likely be some douche we never heard of yet are expected to fear, may require help from lore characters too, and eventually Deathwing will be outclassed.<br />
<br />
In my opinion, Cataclysm should've been the very last thing to happen to WoW. With the world changing and all, it seemed like an appropriate end. Instead, everything is shoved under the rug while we go off to fight for and against Pandas and Kung-Fu Mantises.<br />

<br />
this gets rid of that, which I'm thankful for. though I'm curious with the wording if they're still able to take on dragon form like any dragon, just don't have that extra bit of power, or if they're permanently stuck in those humanoid forms now.</div></div><hr />

Why are so many Blizzard-involved cinematics receiving such a negative youtube response these days? I mean it is really strange that for the last few dislike bar takes at least 1/4. This one definitely does not look so bad. It has pretty much everything to sum up an epic story.<br />
<br />
Either people are trolling Blizz because of the WoW killers coming out soon. (No names necessary.)<br />
<br />
Or people are giving it the thumbs down because of the story, not the actual video. The video itself is fine. Very high quality. But the lore behind it is so far out of left field and it leaves so much of the known up in the air that people who love the lore are going to HATE this. The ending is also very LotR/Star Wars esque, so that only adds to their &quot;rage.&quot; <br />
<br />
But in the end, i really say &quot;Why So Serious?&quot; Ever since 4.06, Blizzard has been throwing a bunch of &quot;left field&quot; pitches; Zandalar Trolls in 4.1, abandonment of the Abysmal Maw, Time Travels ahoy! in the 4.3 5 man instances, visiting Pandaria right at this moment, Theramore to be razed? All of those come out of nowhere. Surprised I didn't see it coming really. It's like finding out Mr. Game &amp; Watch was in Super Smash Bros. Melee. Everyone was like &quot;WHAT THE F***ING HELL IS THIS?!&quot;<br />
<br />
But like in that game, I'm hoping it turns out alright. I mean, didn't people think the same when BC came out? OMG Illadin is a bad guy?! High Elves on the HORDE?! Draenei aren't demons anymore? Why are we going to Outland?! What about the missing Ashbringer?! Shouldn't we be going to the Emerald Dream?!</div></div><hr />

I mean, they were powerful and were granted immortality in order to do their charge. Their &quot;duty&quot;, as they called it, was to deal with Deathwing as they noted quite often throughout the expansion. I'd think they still keep their titles as &quot;aspects&quot; if Thrall does as he is also one. If anything, they will probably continue on as before but with the possibility of dying just like any other dragon: Nefarion, Onyxia, Sinestra, etc. They will hopefully play roles in the game as well. Considering they still have dragon parts on them, so I bet they can turn back too. They're like any other member of their flight, soooo they can transform and do everything as always.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheWerebison</div><div class="date">2011-12-01, 06:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Let us review:<br />
<br />
1) Unlike the last time they used the Dragon Soul, this time, the Aspects lost their powers when using it for no discernible reason.<br />
<br />
2) Nozdormu lost his powers, so Murozond will never have existed, and nothing the Infinite Dragonflight did will ever have happened, so I guess all the CoT instances are gone, and in fact, we never even really did them.<br />
<br />
3) Thrall, the Warchief of the Horde, is now the leader of the world. And before somebody responds saying &quot;Yeah, but Thrall gave up the title of Warchief to some psycho! He's no longer Horde!&quot; ask yourself how you would feel if Varian Wrynn was in Thrall's place, and whether you really believed his hatred for the Horde could just... vanish.<br />
<br />
4) Elrond and the Elves are off to the Grey Havens.<br />
<br />
And perhaps the biggest insult of all,<br />
<br />
5) Deathwing's destruction was wrought by Thrall shooting a rainbow sparkle beam at him, and he exploded into glitter. This is the end of the most terrifying villain Azeroth has ever known. Confetti.<br />
<br />
Hrm, you must've seen a different cutscene than I did. I thought the beam was yellow. You'd be a better troll if you would've said he hit Deathwing with a golden shower. :D And most terrifying villain? Meh. There seems to be a good bit of opinion about that.<br />
<br />
Also, Thrall is not the leader of the world. I can't even imagine such a shallow interpretation being truthful. The Aspects just did what practically every other fantasy story did, saying that mortals are the future of the world. They aren't saying THRALL is the future, it's us, it's all of us. It's that same kinda sappy kind of fantasy story we all should've grown familiar with. &quot;Magic is fading from the world, the mortals will have to carry on&quot;, &quot;the gods are dead, now is the time for mankind to shine!&quot;, etc.</div></div><hr />

You can't stop the true end time. Murozond may or may not happened the same way. But I can tell you they still can breath fire or w/e, and what ever they did before hand. He might not be able to travel through the eons but he is still a bronze dragon. See the eyes? The spikes? Figure it out. I might be wrong they could be stuck in mortal form. But I don't think so.</div></div><hr />

2) Nozdormu has probably lost his powers, yes, but as an ASPECT. It doesn't take an aspect of the Bronze flight to time travel. Chromie does it all the fricking time! He's still a bronze dragon and the leader of his flight. He's still got POWERS, just not world-shattering ones.<br />
<br />
3) Thrall always has and continues to be a big proponent of peace. He and Jaina worked SO HARD for peace between the Alliance and the Horde.<br />
<br />
5) Yeah, and the Lich King was consoled by his daddy and faded away to the afterlife. What more do you want?</div></div><hr />

I was expecting something a little more epic, but whatever. In answering of your list of qq,<br />
<br />
1) It mentions in the new short story (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/game/lore/short-story/charge-aspects/1) That they will pour a hell of a lot more power into it then before. Like, say, all of it.<br />
<br />
2) If you read the dungeon journal, it says he went crazy after &quot;attempting to subvert his mortality&quot;. In other words, it told us he is mortal before we even knew. As for how HE himself has power, the lame response would be old gods did it, but idk what to say.<br />
<br />
3) Thrall was always peace loving, but he didn't back down when the fight was needed. And no, he is not the leader of the world. Leaders of the world would be Varian, garrosh, rohnin, tirion (and bolvar =o)<br />
<br />
4) I don't think the aspects take him there. <br />
<br />
5) His explosion should have been bigger, I will give you that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
first of , I liked this ending so much I just had to make an account and post <br />
I usually just look and laugh :) <br />
<br />
but this seems to me like the ending of wow (at least the parts I was interested in ) <br />
pandas aren't doing anything for me right now ... nor are the other things around them . <br />
<br />
but I loved this ending so much ... it has everything !<br />
it was clear that Thral will destroy Deathwing , with the aspects help . <br />
and now before you ask why ... they couldn't touch the damn dragonsoul ... that is why . <br />
<br />
and I didn't see the whole fight , but I somehow think deathwing is much more powerful now , that is why they lost it all . <br />
and in all honestly , after the elves gave away their immortality , there is no reason the aspects shouldn't do the same to fulfill their purpose , aka &quot;keep the world safe &quot; ... it should always be that those with the greatest power have the greatest responsability because they can do what others cannot .<br />
it was clear they weren't strong enough to just go kill deathwing ... alextraza tried and failed . <br />
<br />
now , another thing why I love this ending ... <br />
I see all people cry about murozond ... and noz loosing his powers . <br />
didn't you see how he's looking at his hourglass ? and at his sand slipping away ? <br />
how he clutches one last bit of it ? <br />
<br />
it's clear he doesn't like what's happening , and most likely THIS is the event that put him on the path of Infinite dragonflight . <br />
He wishes not to die .<br />
it's a normal feeling for all living things not to want to die ... even more so for an immortal . <br />
that last grasp of sand might be all the power needs to go and do something stupid ... and create the infinites .<br />
it's not like they lost all their powers , they are just diminished ... that is why we could even hope to defeat Murozond in end time ... <br />
he can still most likely travel trough time , though he may not enjoy the privileges he had before all of this as an aspect . <br />
<br />
and the &quot;power word : Pregnancy &quot; touch with agra was priceless ! <br />
I don't see why it matters if they copied it from lord of the rings ... there is not even a ring involved ... <br />
it's just the idea that the world goes on , no matter what happened <br />
<br />
it's like saying every time a hero dies in a movie /book /game to save his people the authors copied Jesus from the bible ! <br />
<br />
Just be happy with this <br />
it's a very good ending , not to everyones taste most likely , but it has more merit then bolvar sitting on the frozen &quot;throne &quot; <br />
I really like the fact that , even though wow is an MMO , this has actual closure ... not just ... IT WAS ONLY A SETBACK !</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bewbew</div><div class="date">2011-12-01, 06:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Pretty weak ending.<br />
<br />
Uninspired, bringing nothing truly new for us to hope for during the months of Cataclysm (if not year). That clever, sarcastic, not-as-good as it looks endings from usual Blizzard games is all but missing completly.<br />
<br />
It's the definition of generic fantasy ending. Big dragon dies, super powers step down, all the power is in the hands of the mortal heroes. Happy music and baby-making. The end.<br />
<br />
I expected more from you, Blizzard. I'm disappoint.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Samin</div><div class="date">2011-12-01, 06:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I wish Metzen would go on a very long vacation... I have followed Warcraft lore for more than a decade after playing the first 2 games. Seeing the current lore is... Absurd, horrible in every way. Not only the lore is garbage, but it is also poorly executed in game. I cannot believe :(<br />
With first two games you mean Warcraft 3 and WoW (vanilla)? Because Warcraft I basically had no lore and Warcraft II only had an excuse for the two sides to kill each other off.<br />
I really don't get why people get so insanely attached to the Warcraft 3 lore to a point where they see it as the only true lore...<br />
<br />
<br />
They will however still be insanely powerful magic users though. Plus we have proven that we can over come everything that is put in our way. Algalon? No problem. Deathwing? No problem, Old Gods? No problem. I for one love this cinematic, and it paves a great path to MoP.<br />
Exactly this, the cinematic just made me remember why I love WoW so much, because of the Warcraft lore.<br />
<br />
It almost seems as if people don't realize what possibilities this opens up now. And also that it kills the imminent need of titan (wow lore, not the new game) arrival. Finally. This also means that Blizzard will give us more worldly enemies in MoP again that we can kill without deus ex machina. I like that. It will be like Dragonball GT :P<br />
<br />
Pretty sure many people here are actually just hiding their personal opinion &quot;wahwah lich king was best arch nemesis wahwah&quot; behind those complaints. It confuses me how people get so fed up with a story...I guess it's the same flock who bashes books or movies they don't like - first world problems.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's pretty lame of them to hide lore inside those short stories or the Knaak novels, because we have received mixed messages about whether or not they are canon. One example would be Sinestra being utterly obliterated by Dargonax in the book. Another would be Med'an, the worst character they have ever created, not even being present in the game. And that story is so god-awful that it seems pretty unlikely that it's canon.<br />

He is a bronze dragon still, go re watch the video.<br />

Let me go over this again:<br />

2) He decides to alter the timeways.<br />
3) To do this, he creates the infinite dragonflight.<br />

So if Nozdormu loses his power right now, then in the future, he will not become Murozond, meaning 1) doesn't happen. If 2) and 3) are contingent on 1), then they will never happen either. Blizzard can flail around with all the crap about &quot;the timeways&quot; that they want to, at the end of the day, everything I said is still true.<br />
<br />
But then again, time travel never makes any sense in serious fiction, and their real mistake was bothering with it in the first place. Time travel is only used well in comedy, where the audience doesn't particularly care about logical continuity.</div></div><hr />

Deathwing destroying the world is of course against this charge. That doesn't mean they were created because the Titans KNEW Deathwing would attempt to destroy the world. They simply fulfilled their purpose by protecting the world from destruction at the cost of dragon-kinds immortality and the diminishing of their power. With the loss of the Aspects power, it is now up to us mortals to step up and continue to protect the world in their stead.<br />

<br />
thats terrible logic cause technically then, were immortal since Deathwing is dead and hes the aspect of death... so death no longer exists? oh i get it now. it makes sense its circular reasoning. With deathwing gone, death no longer exists therefore the aspects are still immortal and therefore magic, time, creation of life and dreams can exist. i see.... i get it...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Then suddenly, the Dragon Soul excretes a golden shower out of its mouth to soak the villains lava coated heart in fluid yellow justice. The Dragon Aspects, realizing their shopping list of tasks given to them by the titans (Carton of milk, eggs, loaf of bread, be the guardians of azeroths ancient secrets, and most recently scribbled on, punch that dragon Deathwing in the face) was now finally completed apparently, they proceed to mark off &quot;Troll Old Gods&quot; and promptly lose all their powers, just because they love shitting on Aggra's baby shower. <br />

<br />
Well, Nozdormu always knew he was inevitably mortal as he was given the knowledge of the exact date, time, and manner of his demise. In all likelihood, this sacrifice of such a considerable amount of his own power was what likely made him more prone to Old God influence. He's out in the open world, his duty fulfilled. Remember, as Aspect of Time he is essentially Fate incarnate, as he and his flight are charged with the responsibility of preserving the timeline of Azeroth and make sure everything, good or bad, right down to his own fall to madness and inevitable end, follows the grander scheme of things.</div></div><hr />

And then they annihilate all the major capital cities. The Auction House becomes the Black Market, which is basically like neutral Auction Houses for both factions. Garrosh and Varian get kidnapped and forced to endure tentacle rape for hundreds of years. Players have the potential to be ambushed in the air if they use flying mounts, while ground travel is safer but slower.

Just prior to the release of WotLK, the Rise of the Lich King book came out and was stated to be canonical. Then WotLK hit and everything the beginning to the end of the x-pack contradicted the book.

Like the whole guardians of the world thing never existed.... Whoever wrote these line must have been drunk or just senseless about warcraft lore, and this even got approved...how disappointing...Blizzard.</div></div><hr />

Then WotLK hit and everything the beginning to the end of the x-pack contradicted the book. So now Blizz says &quot;o wait, book is nolonger canon, lol,&quot; to fix the massive clusterfuck of contradictions that couldn't be reconciled.<br />
<br />
I know you were agreeing with me... But that still hurt...</div></div><hr />

All I can do is cancel my account. Which I did 4 days ago. See you all on Coruscant.</div></div><hr />

I'm not joking, and my idea would not be ideal for a lot of players, but at least it creates something interesting and new for them to experience. They say, if you try to please everyone, you will end up pleasing no one. Blizzard is all over the fucking board trying to see what the public will like best, and its ruining the game.</div></div><hr />

So funny, I remember torrential QQ in February 2010 when the LK cinematic released. Now it is all &quot;LK cinematic &gt; Cata!&quot;.<br />
<br />
In my day, we had NO ingame cinematics besides the starters. Kids these days....</div></div><hr />

I was there too, bro. Vanilla, and it was absolutely terrible. For its time? Sure it was the best MMO around. But I'd rather set fire to my computer then go back to Vanilla style questing.<br />
<br />
Blizzard is making billions off of Warcraft, Starcraft, and Diablo. Warcraft alone has made them more money then most countries possess in their lifetime. It should be expected of them to use that money to make things better, not cheap the fuck out.</div></div><hr />

Please note, the above poster created an account just to post this. Hmm<br />
<br />
I suspect a troll. <br />
<br />
Anyway, WoW hate has become the new &quot;cool&quot; thing i guess. To the point where WoW players are insulted bullied off the forums by immature WoW haters. Despicable...</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">meroko</div><div class="date">2011-12-01, 07:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">makes me laugh how people say this makes no sense when it it is kindergarten level thinking required to figure out that the Dragon Aspects HAD to sacrifice their powers to ensure the death of Deathwing. How is that hard to understand? I really pity some of the brain power you people possess =/</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mmoc80ea7ba33a</div><div class="date">2011-12-01, 07:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">yeah... 10th time watching this now and still they dont say 1 thing about the aspects are dead, they lost all there powers or nothing. They lost A power, not all of them. btw, dont you think they might have to give up something in order to kill the ASPECT OF DEATH?! just seems logical to me, dont know why some ppl cant handle that fact...</div></div><hr />

All this criticism yet you haven't stated exactly WHAT is wrong with the cinematic.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sand Person</div><div class="date">2011-12-01, 07:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">wow that was pretty awesome.<br />
<br />
dude, pure win! but fer serious, awesomeness that ending was!</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dalanar</div><div class="date">2011-12-01, 07:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I find it curious that the cinematic focuses/lingers on Nozdormu longer than Ysera or Kalecgos whilst the speech about losing their powers is heard.<br />
<br />
Is it a subtle link to the 5 mans and his demise, and do the leaking sands (of time) mean/say something?<br />
<br />
Or is it just pure randomness/co-incidence.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bewbew</div><div class="date">2011-12-01, 07:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">And then they annihilate all the major capital cities. The Auction House becomes the Black Market, which is basically like neutral Auction Houses for both factions. Garrosh and Varian get kidnapped and forced to endure tentacle rape for hundreds of years. Players have the potential to be ambushed in the air if they use flying mounts, while ground travel is safer but slower. World PVP is in full swing since there are almost no well-guarded cities beyond maybe a central neutral hub.<br />
<br />
GLORIOUS.[COLOR=&quot;red&quot;]<br />
<br />
I love it.<br />
<br />
I find it downright hilarious how we have all this &quot;cataclysm&quot; drama yet the world is safe, all organizations remained intact by such a large &quot;tragedy&quot; and the factions wage war on one another just because they're sort of dicks.<br />
<br />
Now comes the Twilight Apocalypse and factions are broken, struggling with one another over diminishing resources and land (Much more reasonable reasons for Dramatic conflict between factions without either being &quot;the bad guy&quot;), as Azeroth crumbles apart and is destroyed by Old Gods as they try to free themselves. One day you're hanging out in Theramore in game, the other day it's all gone and there's tentacle madness everywhere. Conquer this now, will you, Garrosh?</div></div><hr />

It makes no sense. And its extremely cheesy. I made some points before: The &quot;Time of Mortals&quot;, acting like mortals haven't dominated the last century while the dragons were hiding in fear after they got fucked by various things. The Aspects lose their power, why? Their power was gifted by Warcraft equivalent of gods. And they do this, yet Thrall is completely fine. They say the world is now safe, yet there are still Old Gods, Sargeras, the Legion, Azshara, and an ungodly amount of other threats to this world.<br />
<br />
Its shit.</div></div><hr />
