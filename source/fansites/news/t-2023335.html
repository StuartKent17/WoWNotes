No. You put in the work to get it first, before everyone else. As time goes on it becomes easier to catch up, but you'll still always be ahead if you grind.<br />

People who are not you may have different opinions.<br />
Yes, I am.<br />
I have more solid views on some, less so on others.<br />
<br />
YOU are not, very different from whether others are not.<br />
<br />
And on AP progression gating, the lack of it is something I am very pleased about.<br />
Plus the inability for players to directly examine and determine that.<br />
That was a major worry for me, yet another player-created measure for the sole purpose of doing less leading while demanding more of the benefits.</div></div><hr />

Good thing none of the pali specs come with one. You are not divisive over what weapons Palis came with.<br />
<br />
And neither are ranged hunters... MM = gun and BM = bow. But that's not what they got.<br />

To the other spec artifact, I don't think so.<br />

<br />
No. You do not get to use the appearance of the other spec weapon. And in Beta, the FIRST thing I did was transmog that absolutely UGLY azz squirt gun into the Black Bow of the Betrayer.<br />
<br />
I told the hunter council to kiss my ass and keep their POS artifact. I have Thori'dal, the Stars' Fury off of Kil'Jaeden... but noooooooo... can't tmog that either. Blizz whores out so much to casuals but remains stubborn on certain things that chaps people's asses.</div></div><hr />

So far that is exactly how it turned out, if you want to farm for the artifact power items you can, you will be ahead until the people that play less start reaching max as well.</div></div><hr />

Make up your mind.<br />
You say about what goes with your spec, and then about what they come with.<br />
Two different things.<br />
<br />
&quot;Going with&quot; a spec is a very subjective opinion.<br />
It can have established lore as a basis, it could be a gameplay or even aesthetic reason.<br />
Different people will have different opinions.<br />
<br />
There isn't a right or wrong generally.<br />
Just that which may be supported in a very specific context, particularly the lore.</div></div><hr />

Why are they fake ?<br />
Because YOU did not ask them ?<br />
Or it could be that players who aren't you ask different questions.<br />
Otherwise why didn't they come to you for all the questions, as you seemingly think yours are that representative of everyone else.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can a) xmog titanstrike ( the Bm artifact which is a Gun) to look like any non artifact/legendary bow per normal ranged weapon Xmogs rules in WoD.<br />
B) Unlock ( from a vendor in Dalaran in this case for ~8k gold) a BM hunter specific Bow model for Titanstrike. This model is unique to BM hunters and Titanstrike.<br />
<br />
There is a similar case for the Marks hunter and changing their bow, Thas'dorah, to a gun appearence.<br />
<br />
You DO NOT unlock any of Titanstrike's appearances for Thas'dorah or vice versa.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;Weapon Types<br />
There are a few of the Artifacts where the weapon type goes back and reflects the old story.<br />
A big hammer and book is a classic Holy Paladin look from older Warcraft.<br />
The weapon type changes are also to help the weapon feel unique.<br />
The Holy Paladin had a mace and shield for a long time, but you don't actually use them in combat.&quot;<br />
<br />
Does anyone know if you can still mog a shield over that book or is that going to mean pali's basically lose that shield look 100%? I know right now you cannot mog a shield over the offhand (non-shield).. that would suck as I really enjoy seeing hpali's with shields..</div></div><hr />

I know, I know 'b-b-but ASHBRINGER!' Meh. I think all paladins specs should be more mace/hammers than swords or axes, not just Holy. At least, that's how I've always thought about them. If not, I'll simply transmog, but would still be a nice touch, IMO.</div></div><hr />

I'd prefer a mace over a sword. Some prefer sword? That's exactly what divisive is. Some MM will want a bow, some will want a gun. That's Divisive. Not every MM wants a bow, Not all of them want a gun. Some don't get that option. Ret paladin included.<br />

All the retribution skins are revealed. No hammer. But as I've been told all ret paladins want a Sword, so we don't deserve that choice like others should get.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A lot of the argument against relaxing the &quot;transmog this to this&quot; rules have been the animations.<br />
Are there ability animations tied to the off-hand slot, which would make a shield &quot;not work&quot; ?<br />
It there aren't, then I see no reason why that technically could not work.<br />
It would just require blizzard to change that.</div></div><hr />

I'm sorry but I can see no point in your post.<br />
<br />
They made lore up for much of this artifact stuff. As you said it's subjective,. so they SHOULD have designed it in such a way choice was there. But no.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">skorpioX</div><div class="date">2016-07-07, 10:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here are some of my opinions on what I’ve heard from all of these Q&amp;A videos.<br />
The blood of Sargeras should be bind on account and tradeable to other players. One thing I learned from each expansion is that mats are useless and have no endgame use for upgrading your character before the next expansion is released. Upgrading gear should always have a constant flow through patches.<br />
I believe it’s about time for players to be responsible in crafting their own gear. That’s the point of having professions in the first place. Players have been spoiled enough into getting free loot with no work put into it. Blade and Soul has a great way on how to level up gear and weapons. This means that players need to go into the dungeons to obtain the mats to level up their gear. What do I mean by this?<br />
<br />
First have players finish all the story world content in order to unlock all the dungeons. Giving players access to dungeons while still doing world content I find it to be all wrong. By doing this there is a high probability of them not returning to those dungeons at max level. <br />
Players doing these dungeons will have to earn mats to learn how to craft the piece of gear they need. Mobs and bosses will not drop any gear anymore. Each dungeon has mats for every single profession that is not found in the world. This is something that’s never been done in dungeons. These mats can be found scattered all over the dungeons and through drops from mobs and bosses. They can be traded with people in the same group if they have duplicates or that will benefit a class that needs it. They cannot be sold or traded outside the group. This ends the whole bad luck drops scenario.<br />
Once completing a full set of gear on Normal Mode you can upgrade that set 2 more times by doing Heroic and Mythic in which different mats are needed. <br />
As for LFR players things are a little different. LFR is in place so that players could see the content. There is nothing wrong with that. I believe everyone should see all the content in the game they paid for. That’s why I believe that they should have the opportunity craft a tier set. But, they cannot upgrade it. Upgrading only is available by doing Normal-Mythic. This should also work on PVP. Instead of the mobs dropping the items players will. <br />
<br />
While on the subject of Professions I think that mounts crafted on alts should be account bound and added to your mount list. It’s a real pain for my main character not being able to use the mounts already crafted by my alts. I wouldn’t care if it was faction specific. <br />
<br />
Now I want to talk about Artifact Weapons. I have a total of 10 characters in which they each have 3 artifact weapons. I’m not sure if I’m going to level up each of my characters artifact weapons. I’m having a bad time right now deciding which character and faction I’m going to use. I believe this whole endeavor is going to be a very stressful and an unfulfilling waste of time to grind in the end. But there is a way to relieve some of this.<br />
<br />
I’m not sure how the repec works in this game, but I believe that there should be an Artifact pool for each character. Let’s say I ‘m using my Beast Mastery Hunter and he has over 10,000 Artifact points. Then I decide that I don’t like how it’s working out and I decide to go Marksman. When I switch specs the 10,000 points will be removed from Beast Mastery and I can use it on this spec instead. Now he said that all artifact weapons share the same points. If this is correct then this is even better.</div></div><hr />

<br />

Still the same, if you run faster then you should complete it faster.<br />
Just as if you're saving money for something you should get there faster if you work more.</div></div><hr />

You won't have to worry about your offhand transmog as a holy paladin. They don't even have an offhand in the first place, they have a 2 hander and the book is not an actual item, it just hangs on your waist.<br />

From Beta experience<br />
<br />
- Respec costs roughly as much as the next trait would cost you, meaning if you are at the 9th rank for your Artifact Weapon it will only cost you a few thousand. However if you're at rank 36 it's going to cost you several hundred thousand.<br />
- Artifact power is locked to whichever artifact weapon you bound them to, meaning if you have grinded 50.000 artifact power for Marksman you can't respec and then place them in Survival or Beast Master. You can not place Artifact Power from one weapon to another, you can however grind Artifact Power tokens using the spec you've progressed the most with and then just use the tokens once you've respecced.</div></div><hr />

Some would, but lets look at Armageddon, no matter who wields that it looks beastly, but completely ridiculous, what would be the difference in say that and the mount hyjal fists being your back?<br />

While a lot of them would look ridiculous, one of the developers tweeted this back in November:<br />
<br />
https://twitter.com/craig_amai/status/662745830051328000<br />
<br />
<br />
We have some special-handling in mind for sheathing for things like the fist weapons. They won't be invisible =)<br />
<br />
So it's pretty understandable for people to be upset when they're forced into a weapon type that they can't transmog out of, told they'd be able to see it still while sheathed, then months later told &quot;Nope, we changed our minds.&quot; So now everyone else is running around with their new models visible at least at their sides/on their backs and monks/shamans are left having to manually pull them out. And unfortunately monk is probably the least-played class so adding animations for other weapon types (the main reason you can't transmog out of fists) isn't going to be on the table.</div></div><hr />

Ah okay my mistake then there. <br />
<br />
But I don't think all of them would look ridiculous, maybe seethe them on the back instead? <br />
<br />
Some would, but lets look at Armageddon, no matter who wields that it looks beastly, but completely ridiculous, what would be the difference in say that and the mount hyjal fists being your back?<br />
<br />
Also, theres issues with tabards on players, undead character issues with bones and gear. I could go on, I don't think Id class fist weps being ridiculous at the top of the list of stuff that would need sorting tbh.<br />
<br />
Might be a bit tricky to have some weapons show on your back sometimes, but sometimes not, depending on appearance. <br />
<br />
And yeah, it's probably not high priority so they're just not fiddling with it.<br />

So it's pretty understandable for people to be upset when they're forced into a weapon type that they can't transmog out of, told they'd be able to see it still while sheathed, then months later told &quot;Nope, we changed our minds.&quot; So now everyone else is running around with their new models visible at least at their sides/on their backs and monks/shamans are left having to manually pull them out. And unfortunately monk is probably the least-played class so adding animations for other weapon types (the main reason you can't transmog out of fists) isn't going to be on the table.<br />
<br />
Ah, I had forgotten that. <br />
<br />

<br />
I think you're missing the analogy. The point is that no matter how fast each person runs, everyone will get to the finish line. Some will just get there faster than others.<br />
<br />
The people who play 30+ hours a week will get done faster than the people who play &lt;5 hours.<br />
<br />
Then, as time moves on, everyone will start to see an increase in their AP and the people playing &lt;5 hours a week will ultimately reach the same destination you reached months earlier. You're still ahead and rewarded for getting there before them, but everyone will get there.<br />
<br />
It also works great for people who join the game 3/4 through the expansion's life. They'll gain AP quickly enough to catch up without too many issues.<br />

You get a Dalaran hearthstone, normal hearthstone, + still have garrison hearthstone. Traveling to order hall is made practically instant by taking the eagle to the left instead of flight master to the right at the landing. Oh and the portals are in Dal same place they were in Wrath.

<br />
Dalaran has portals to every class's Order Hall (who don't have their own portal spell), each major faction city, Shattrath, Shrine, Caverns of Time, Karazhan, Wyrmrest Temple, Dalaran Crater and one more I keep forgetting. You get a Dalaran-specific Hearthstone that takes you there once every 20 minutes, and your Garrison Hearthstone sticks around in case you need it.<br />
<br />
Trust me, you aren't going back to Dalaran so often that you need to &quot;set everything&quot; to it. If you are, you're being inefficient. Hell, I sometimes use my Dalaran Hearthstone to cut down travel time; it's something I can waste, because I don't need to be in Dalaran as much as my Garrison. Most Order Hall stuff can be left for the start or end of a play session, and the rest of the time spent questing or doing dungeons or whatever.<br />
<br />
The last zone is even right next to Dalaran. If you have a slow fall you can just float down there, but it's much quicker to get a flight path. I'm fairly certain the flight paths I've seen are faster than any level of riding skill will give a player's flying mount; flying mounts will only be used for short-distance travel from a flight point to the objective, if you're min-maxing speed, or for some of the less direct flight paths, of which I've found perhaps two so far.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Absolute CRAP. So basically, the more you invest in the game, the less you get in return. This is utter bullshit.<br />
<br />
Strange, I figured you if anyone would be happy that the gap between very active players and more casual players can be lessened, since giving the 60h player 15 times more AP would create some very unfortunate incitements. There has to be a catch-up mechanic like this.<br />
<br />
Perhaps you've got an incorrect impression from that quote, at least if you think this means active players won't be rewarded for more effort, which they will. Research speed per Knowledge was 5 days? So every 5 days people can get a boost. Active players will always be ahead (and no, not just for those 5 days) but this system ensures that a casual single-digit hour/week player won't find themselves half a year behind in AP for long.<br />
<br />
Purely theoretical numbers, but if a very active player gets capped in 2 months, a more laid-back player might do so in 4, even if they play a lot less thanks to Knowledge, but they'll obviously never be &quot;on par&quot; with the more active player before both are capped.</div></div><hr />

Some prefer sword? That's exactly what divisive is. Some MM will want a bow, some will want a gun. That's Divisive. Not every MM wants a bow, Not all of them want a gun. Some don't get that option. Ret paladin included.<br />
<br />
I prefer the selection of my weapons due to RP reasons on a more defined base. My holy paladin who is a BE would rather have a sword and either shield or book as offhand. My holy paladin who is Human would rather have a mace / hammer in conjunction with shield or book. In general, I prefer swords for BE paladins, and maces for everybody else, because BEs got their paladins a bit different from the rest, so the edgy thing suits them more. For dwarves, hammers are iconic anyway, and for taurens, I would also settle with blunt weapons, but with a more tribal look.<br />
<br />
My BM hunter is BE with a more &quot;classical&quot; approach and always had a bow or a bow mog. My MM hunter is an engineer and thus has a gun. My human hunter is survival, and I will possibly settle with a spear, because this is the most iconic melee weapon for hunters besides axes for me (spears are better in more open areas, or when you need some extra reach, axes are good for gettin through thicker woods).<br />
<br />
On my main character who is a BE mage, I have the problem that I would like to go arcane in Legion, but I also love playing frost and I should get the fire artifact as well because iconic BE weapon. Will we be able to get all 3 artifacts, because we will be able to play all specs?</div></div><hr />

They are not the only ones who dont like the type casting of their weapons... and dont get a special appearance choice.<br />

Shadowpriests have NOT been happy type casted to a dagger, and an old god ugly one at that... which is obscurely hidden on the hip underneath a perpetual shadow form. Why not a wand, or a staff, or a halo, or a floating Old God eyeball... something other than a sharp pointy thing, we never ever going to stab anyone with. <br />
Some Shaman Elementals not a fan of a single fist weapon (that doesnt sheath) and an odd mini-shield<br />

I take it to mean they have even more gates that I can see that make people who are playing the game, wait for those who aren't. In the long run it won't matter... I'll be leaving game a couple months after launch with flight delayed. II too will benefit from the catch up mechanism. But that is not the game I used to love and play. The one I played you ran dungeons for sets to get into raiding, attunements to get into those raids, farmed a lot to craft ONE BiS piece of gear, went out into the world and ground specific mobs because it was found to drop the item, pattern, recipe, you were looking for.<br />
<br />
Now you just log in for 4 hours a week, run a few quests, a dungeon or two, LFR and never really get good at you character. All the while knowqing Blizz has got your back and will give everything in the game to you if you are just patient... sounds a lot like Obama.</div></div><hr />
