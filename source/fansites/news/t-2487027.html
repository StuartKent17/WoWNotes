Greetings Beta Testers,<br />
<br />
Starting on the afternoon of May 24, we will be enabling the PvP Honor System and the Warsong Gulch Battleground in the WoW Classic Beta realms. Beta players are invited to queue for Warsong Gulch from 12:00 p.m. PDT to 4:00 p.m. PDT on Saturday, May 25 and Sunday, May 26 as we try to spin up as many instances of the battleground as possible. While we’re targeting that timeframe to help capture data, players who are logged into the beta will be able to queue for Warsong Gulch at the Warsong Gulch battlemaster in capital cities at any time throughout the weekend.<br />
<br />
As a reminder, queuing for Warsong Gulch requires your character to be level 10 or higher.<br />
<br />
We have a few known issues related to Warsong Gulch:<br />
<br />
<br />
The Battleground Scoreboard does not currently display Flag Captures and Flag Return statistics.<br />
The Battleground Scoreboard stat numbers are misaligned with player names.<br />
<br />
<br />
Have fun racking up those HKs and don’t forget to submit any bugs or issues that you encounter using the in-game bug reporter.</div></div><hr />

This is nothing new. Blizzard have always invited in waves - it allows for a focused group to test and it allowed them to keep an eye on everything relatively closely. As the beta goes on and when they’re happy enough that things are stable they’ll send out another wave, thus the process repeats. They’ll do it as long as they’re satisfied they can control the beta environment, so if they’re happy enough sending out more waves they will.</div></div><hr />

This is the first time they've basically said &quot;we've got what we need, we'll re-evaluate later&quot; though, so it's a bit weird, specially when you keep hearing how people are having trouble testing because they can't find groups for anything.<br />
<br />
Part of the problem could be that people are spread out everywhere doing things instead of sitting in Org or Ironforge... wonder how long it will be before someone develops some LFG addon that you can create groups to run things on.</div></div><hr />

its tough. the whole population of a faction is in fewer than 10 zones. despite there not being THAT many people on the server, there's always competition for quests (grp v grp). If they're stress testing layer technology, I'd assume its not fully reliable, and they're waiting on that to get more people in here.<br />
<br />
Also, groups form in seconds to minutes from my experience.</div></div><hr />

Layering was wonky on stress test, I actually got a character stuck in an infinite world server down loop by switching between layers. Could be a reason to slow down for now, but their wording on the post pointed more towards &quot;we have enough&quot;</div></div><hr />

that would be really disappointing, but i guess they did say something along the lines of not needing as many voices because they aren't interested in the typical beta feedback of &quot;how do you feel about this new system&quot;. I still hope that they try to invite more to really iron out the wrinkles.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Bit weird to have a beta at all then and not just multiple stress tests alone. There's still going to be bugs since they rebuilt the game on the new client so they should still be trying to shove as many testers in as possible.<br />
<br />
Maybe not for how it feels, but to try and break as much as possible, so that it all goes smoothly on launch. How shitty are they going to feel if the first guild to pull in MC runs into a bug because they didn't have enough testers on beta to test raids thoroughly.</div></div><hr />

After playing so long your interest and attention to detail is going to slip compared to someone new excited to help polish the beta.</div></div><hr />

Hopefully that addon is banned. Any addons that weren't available at the time of Classic should not be allowed on the Classic servers. People either need to decide whether to go questing or stay in Org for 2+ hours trying to find a group. #NoChanges</div></div><hr />

I hate to break it to you, but there's going to be a shit ton of addons that didn't exist in vanilla, as well as a bunch of addons that used to work that won't work anymore.<br />
<br />
It's using the modern API not the old one, ie, things like dps and threat meters will actually work but things like supermacro will not.<br />
<br />
Weakauras is already working on a Classic a version and DBM has already released their version.<br />
<br />
Honestly though, there was no reason a LFG type addon couldn't have existed in Vanilla, it was just that no one made one.</div></div><hr />

Twitter confirmed its a visual bug, we're not actually in... not nice to tease though... should just let us in.<br />
<br />
Edit: yup, entirely a visual bug, now I'm annoyed.</div></div><hr />

I just just realize how ridiciously bad nameframes in pvp were, no class icon or color, and no castbars. Basically have to guess what you are fighting without addon nameplates^^</div></div><hr />

Yeah, but back then it was very easy to tell a class. You see a shield it is Warrior or Paladin. If you see a bow Hunter. Staff with pet Warlock. Staff Mage and so on.<br />
<br />
Nameplate colors is a good qol change for easier identification, but you could tell classes apart</div></div><hr />
