<br />
My guess is the allied races will be in the patch content, but will be part of a pre-order promotion for the expansion to get early access to them. Kinda like what they did with demon hunters.</div></div><hr />

Strings added. They hotfixed the achievements on the PTR to hide them.</div></div><hr />

I guess it is removal from required achievements not transmogs.<br />
<br />
I admit, that Razorscale achievement is pain in the arse at least for me.</div></div><hr />

ah yes, so the difficulty is still split in 2 except the achievements are now merged into 1 type</div></div><hr />

<br />
Agreed, only I'm missing the 10m instead. Probably among the most annoying achievements to get now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
surprisingly enough when I did it, the 10 man version of Razorscale is much much harder than 25 man version. The problem is with not killing the iron dwarf.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's pretty hard not to kill them now but at the same time they need to take damage so razorscale kills them. I think the only way to do this is to wait for her to enrage. Basically anything you'll do with a max level char will kill the dwarves i think.</div></div><hr />

removing all your gear and just hitting them with melee hits?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Even completely naked you will still one shot the regular mobs at 110, but I didn't even need to hit them. I just protected the engineers until the harpoons were fixed, then went afk and waited for them to kill all the NPCs and for the boss to enrage. By that point there were more than enough spawned so I gathered them up, pulled her down, punched her bare handed down below 50% and she breathed and one shot all of them at once and I got the achievement.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I really dislike this idea of them being &quot;digital pre-order bonus only&quot;, for those of us buying Collector's Editions. Unless Blizzard is going to be giving stores pre-order codes so we can get in on the bonuses too.</div></div><hr />
