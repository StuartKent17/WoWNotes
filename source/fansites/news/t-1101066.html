During the scheduled server maintenance on the week of March 26, the “Power of the Aspects” spell will grow more powerful, reducing the health and damage dealt of all enemies in the Dragon Soul raid by 15%. This spell will grow progressively stronger over time to reduce the difficulty and make the encounters more accessible. The spell will affect both normal and Heroic difficulties, but it will not affect the Raid Finder difficulty.

Don’t need the help of the Dragon Aspects? The spell can be disabled by talking to Lord Afrasastrasz at the beginning of Dragon Soul.<br />
<br />
We hope you continue to enjoy Dragon Soul, and that these changes encourage you to attempt a higher difficulty, or just keep pushing to down that next boss.</div></div><hr />

step of your 5 mile high horse and stop being so &quot;tough&quot;. Yes its ICC over again, we've known that since they announced it, this is a debuff that will increase till it reaches 30%. What part of that was hard to understand? Are you gonna QQ when the 20, 25 and 30% debuff comes as well?</div></div><hr />

<br />
So... Is it time to go nuts with patterns and stuff? 4 weeks between each change of the debuff... And Wowhead apparently have 7 versions of the buff up to 35%... If it kept being every 4 weeks until 35% that would be about 17-18th of July... Thus we can predict MoP won't be out until maybe 15th of August! =D<br />

Yeah, I'm kinda bored atm. =P</div></div><hr />

My guild is the only 8/8 H within this server and we've been 8 since the start of 5%, The other guilds are still within 6/8. However I think the mechanics of spine are utterly destroying those guilds upon my server still haha as sadistic as this sounds<br />

Or maybe not as many people are doing hard modes as people who like to claim they are. Perhaps it's only a very small minority who type very loudly. If hard modes are really so popular, why go to such lengths to get people to try them?</div></div><hr />

at 25% is when morchok 25man will have the same hp as morchok LFR.<br />
I would already say though that at 10% normal is easier than LFR if you're doing it as a guild. Just because the people in lfr are typically not very high calibre players.<br />

Except they shouldn't be given free access to H: DS, that's what LFR is for.

And when MoP comes out that wouldn't happen? It didn't happen in ICC? This is how it goes... it isn't going to change. Just get used to it. You did awesome and are probably known on your realm for doing so, by no means does this diminish your accomplishment. It just let's slightly less talented raiders have a chance as well. There are no LFR heroes that are even able to do H Morchok so I doubt you have any kind of actual worry.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So the game is about getting gear and running around in SW? Your gear or anyone else's gear means nothing to me or a lot of people since we will never group with you or contest with you since everything is instanced. <br />
<br />
It's not like EQ where the best can do things, stream roll the weak, and be feared (kill steals on bosses) when seen in dungeons.<br />
<br />
All the gears in WoW is useless since every 3 months new gear comes out and makes the previous gear easy to get. Try it out. delete all your gear off your toon and within 2 months you'll have all the best gears again.</div></div><hr />

Waiting for this third nerf to hit a few more heroics. Casual guild is casual, especially since we rebuilt the guild like a month or two ago. So I ain't complaining. I think the way they are nerfing 5% a month is better than what they originally did for BC where they just nerfed the entire content 30% in one fell swoop.It's been said before, this content is already over and done with. Let Blizzard attempt to keep people around by allowing folks who don't raid hardcore and even those who are just extremely casual about playing the game feel like they've achieved something even if it is nerfed content.</div></div><hr />

I really hope they don't repeat the situation they presented in Cata.

If you wanted to make a level 80 &quot;twink&quot; (not sure why you would, but still) you just bought Cata greens. IMO, we shouldn't be replacing 410 gear until level 89.</div></div><hr />

The problem with that is that your Cata gear becomes less and less powerful with each level you gain. It takes away a lot of the fun of your high ilevel Cata gear.</div></div><hr />

Heroic Ultraxion is the most retarded boss design ever, considering you need classes who have short CDs on their mitigation, which is especially evident in 10 men raids.

I wish this was true for our guild, but a 15% debuff to the bosses doesn't make people click to go into the Twilight Zone when it's their turn. My one criticism for this expansion is that one player will one your raid consistently. I play with RL friends though, and not killing raid bosses isn't going to make me not be friends with them.

That said I'm trying to understand why anyone would be so against this nerf, the way I see it is you have 2 groups of players, a) Those 8/8hc - In which case they have already had the achievement and accomplishment of clearing the content. Well done to these players and their teams.b) Those not 8/8hc - In which case, hopefully the instance is now going to allow you to experience of progressing through the heroic modes and for you to enjoy the mechanics and tuning of these encounters. To those complaining, id like to hear a reasonable justified message to why you are so against it.<br />
<br />
The only reasonable response I think you'll get is from the people that spent hundreds of wipes per boss kill and feel that this will trivialize the content that they had to work so hard for. I don't agree with it, but that's the closest I think you'll get to &quot;reasonable justified&quot;. You've already referenced most of what you'll get in response, which is trolls and flames.</div></div><hr />

I just dont see the logic in &quot;Because I cleared it when it was harder, other people don't deserve too when its not as hard&quot; It seems incredibly selfish for a game that we all pay equal amounts to enjoy. <br />
<br />
Surely the reward in clearing it pre-nurf is the satisfaction of knowing you did it, rather than making sure everyone else knows it. Blizzard spent a long time developing content such as Sunwell, and only a small % of players even saw it let alone made it to Kil'jeaden. Our guild is currently 0/8hc but 8/8hc so this is a welcome patch for us to try heroic modes with our semi casual friendship guild.</div></div><hr />

402-404 ilvl is my prediction. Original Kel'Thuzad dropped (max) ilvl 92 gear and TBC starting gear was ilvl 81 (-11). Illidan dropped ilvl 151 and wotlk starting gear was ilvl138 (-13). Heroic Lich King/Halion dropped ilvl 284 and entry level gear for Cata started at ilvl 272 (-12). Heroic Madness drops 416ilvl.....so following what i perceive to be a pattern...</div></div><hr />

It's poor game design philosophy to determine that anyone who can scrounge together 10 people on a weekly basis should be allowed to kill H-Madness.

Even tough it's only heroic on it's name by now... -15% of the original is hardly &quot;heroic&quot;.<br />

And heroic content doesn't exist. There is nothing new, no extra boss, no extra cinematic or endings. It's just higher dificulty.<br />
<br />
No surprises anymore. We all know by now that all that blablablawe're checking the progress and only increase the necessaryblablabla was BS. They're not checking anything and don't even care since ppl will be paying to play the beta.<br />
<br />

<br />
Yes, and you're intentionally making the game harder and you get no tangible benefit. There's no special achievement to say you turned off the nerf, no extra loot, no special mount for it, nothing. That's why no one turns off the nerf; hell, some guilds see it as a way to make farming HM DS easier and get the raid done and have the rest of the week to do whatever you want. What reason do I have to turn off the nerf and do HM 25 fights at 0% like they were before the nerf came out (sans tendon health on HM Spine being retuned)?<br />

I don't get why there's so much hate towards these nerfs..... You can still turn off the buff and claim that you've done the raid w/o the nerfs.. Every player is paying his or her monthly fee so why shouldnt they have chance at the heroic raids ;) So much elitist turds around...<br />

They always had the chance, like every single paying customer. Nobody said they couldn't do it. So much &quot;i want what you got&quot; turds... that broke the game.<br />

At this time , any nerfs don't matter. The beta is around the corner so they want to give a hand up to the guilds that still haven't cleared it.Hell, my guild is still 1/8H and were 0/8H before any of the nerfs started, we just aren't really a Heroic Guild (very casual) but this will help us move along and get some 410 loot to bide our time until MoP.<br />
<br />
Well... if you're not a heroic guild... well... it's not the heroic dificult problem...<br />
<br />
LFR, Normal, Heroic.<br />
<br />
Choose the one that suits you, leave the others to whoever it suits better. No reason to &quot;i'm don't like it, but i want it too&quot;.<br />
<br />
You're not worse than the others because you're on LFR or Normal, but you're worse than others when you just can't live with it and want what others have. Pure Jealous.<br />

What good 410 loot will bring to you in MoP? Yeah, none.</div></div><hr />

If anything they should increase the stacks at a faster rate with MoP coming. If 1 in 10 players are going to be getting a beta invite via the annual pass, that means on average 1 in 10 people are going to disappear from live WoW. The average raid right now is 10 man, so that means guilds will need to recruit because people won't want to play as much when they play pandaparty. If you increase the stacks faster then we can be at the 30% sooner so as to make HDS a 1-2 hour raid and people can get back to MoP beta faster. And with D3 coming, who is going to want to bother with WoW more than 1 night a week until MoP release? Seriously, think ahead and long term.</div></div><hr />

Waiting for this third nerf to hit a few more heroics. Casual guild is casual, especially since we rebuilt the guild like a month or two ago. So I ain't complaining. I think the way they are nerfing 5% a month is better than what they originally did for BC where they just nerfed the entire content 30% in one fell swoop.It's been said before, this content is already over and done with. Let Blizzard attempt to keep people around by allowing folks who don't raid hardcore and even those who are just extremely casual about playing the game feel like they've achieved something even if it is nerfed content.<br />
<br />
Except that BC didn't have LFR and Normal modes.<br />
<br />
Not only that, but the 30% nerf was necessary due to the reworked combat/talent system introduced with the 3.0 patch before WotLK, wich removed necessary tools (skills/talents/stats) to deal with the old BC raids. Without the nerfs and the tools, nobody would be able to do any raid until WotLK went live.<br />
<br />
Even without that, can't compare 2 months of nerfed BC with an entire expansion that get nerfed each tier for months and months without a reworked system or even a xpac near.</div></div><hr />

I wonder how far they are going to nerf the standard 10/25 raid version down. People are already seeing and enjoying the raid content with the Raid Finder Dragon Soul. What is the point of offering a challenge if you keep lowering the bar over and over just so people can jump it?<br />
<br />
I would estimate the same 30 percent as the previous final tier. (If anyone foolishly believes that MoP is going to be out before October, I pity them. 3 more months of progressive reductions followed by 3 months of &quot;farming&quot; the last instance followed by perhaps 8 weeks of build up. That should put us right around Thanksgiving to perfectly set up for a Christmas release.)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not when the game is tunned for that to not happen. He's not talking about just hidding the gear so you're stuck with 410 even if level 86-90 was designed to use 410+.<br />

You needed higher ilvl gear than 272 while leveling in Cata because it was setup that way.</div></div><hr />

Except if the other people have already cleared it, it's not exactly screwing them over, now is it? And if you're still working on it, then you're obviously not as l33t as you think you are.

Although I've been playing this game for many years like others, I simply cannot stand whiners who think they are the top dog in this game. Get through your think skull that many don't care how good you are, nor do you care how bad others are in comparison to you or your guild. Stop complaining like a bunch of little girls what others do. Do what you do, and keep your nose in your own business. What is it to you if they are doing this buff? Haven't you finished those raids like many nights ago and still going strong as if that's your second job? I play this game casually and haven't even stepped into raiding since Naxx, due to whiners like some of you. Enjoy the game, don't spoil it for everyone else. This buff is great for those who wish to utilize it. Ahh community, just getting worse and worse.</div></div><hr />

My guild raids casually (3 hours a day, 2 nights a week). We have some good players but work and such gets in the way of a hardcore schedule. We likely aren't good enough to clear 8/8HM with no buff, but the 5% was enough to not have us face smashing for nothing, and with time we would have cleared the content. Now we'll have 15%, and already we're starting to get bored with part of our run.On the other hand, once we're done with 8/8HM, if we have time we'll farm mounts for everyone and take a break until mists, so that will happen faster now :D.</div></div><hr />

dragon soul, on the other hand, has LFR setting, to allow those without guilds/time/motivation to raid see the end boss of cataclysm, so what's the logic behind the continued nerf?<br />

while i do not really condone the people hinging their &quot;success&quot; in the game based on what boss they killed on heroic and how much max ilevel gear they wonder around org/SW with, i can understand their fury at having their efforts reduced to nothing by a nerf that i can only conclude is a shameless attempt to reduce difficulty in order to &quot;bribe&quot; any player still in the game with effortless items of the highest quality.</div></div><hr />

Turning off the nerf gives you absolutely no tangible benefit whatsoever. If I go back to 0% HM 25 Ultraxion, do I get extra loot? Do I get bonus Valor or raise my weekly Valor cap?

That's not really what I'm advocating. I'm just tired of idiots who say to turn off the nerf when there's no incentive to do so. I also don't see what's so hard about learning how to play your class. WoW isn't quantum physics.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Kinda fucked if you feel like 5% or 10% was &quot;right&quot; for you. Likewise, the first 5-6 bosses are of a vastly different difficulty level to the last 2. We certainly don't need the buff on the first lot, but we're progressing on spine and I doubt we'd manage it without at least the 5%. So there's the option to <br />
<br />
a) Faceroll through the first 3/4 of the instance, then spend time progressing on the last two fights - like it was in Firelands, the tier essentially turns into 1 boss.<br />
<br />
b) Turn it off and potentially brickwall later in the instance.</div></div><hr />

I'm not him, but that doesn't make his comment any less valid. I'm fine with nerfs, for normal, whatever. I'm fine to a certain degree to nerf hardmodes. In the end all it does though is drag this patch on and on and on and on. Not enough people saw the &quot;content&quot;, if that's what you can call heroic modes, so there's no need for new patches at a faster rate, after all: the content hasn't really been &quot;cleared&quot; yet.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, as you correctly said there'll never be raids only for 5% of the population in WoW. I also don't think that's what these people are asking for. What they're wondering however is why there's different modes for every kind of player - LFR for the terribads, normal for the casuals and heroic for those who want a challenge - when the different modes will get nerfed so much that in the end there remains only 1 mode: that for casuals. No matter how many nerfs you implement, it will never teach the terribads how to deal with mechanics, so they can't do heroic anyway, and those players who want a challenge (and that's not just very good players mind you!) will feel cheated on their nerfed heroic modes.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying this is my stance on the subject, to have no nerfs. Honestly I'm fine with nerfs, as long as they're paced and as long as the first ones comes a good time after the release of the content. I feel the Firelands nerfs came too fast on heroic anyway, for example. Give people time to learn to deal with a raid and its mechanics, and I believe that's time that's not being given to players, especially those who don't play a whole lot.</div></div><hr />

It means people complete the content quicker, which is completely backwards, as there usually is a lull after the last content patch and the new expansion anyway.

From a WoWProgress, Gear, Time, and Satisfaction standpoint, there is absolutely no reason to turn off the buffs. :(<br />

3 hours for a full clear probably means you wiped a few times. So it cant be that easy for you. I cant see full clear with no wipes taking 3 hours, unless there are breaks after every boss or just general silliness going on. I'm basing this on my own experience. We clear 1 hc (morchok) and rest on normal in just over 90 min (had 28 min left on 2h flask last time) and that's with no wipes or breaks. We're very casual. Some weeks we dont feel like progressing on a new hc boss and just power thru the bosses.</div></div><hr />

We don't have legendaries in our raid (just my daggers since last week) but we are still the second best alliance guild on our realm... the realm is BIG but there just aren't that much people interested in hardmode raids.

I wonder how far they are going to nerf the standard 10/25 raid version down. People are already seeing and enjoying the raid content with the Raid Finder Dragon Soul. What is the point of offering a challenge if you keep lowering the bar over and over just so people can jump it?<br />
<br />
What is the point of complaining? They already said that they would be going up to 30% debuff from day dot, yet every-time they increase it, people like yourself keep coming out of the wood works with ZOMG!?!?!?!?!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well same question right back at you then... Why would those casuals give 2 fucks about those &quot;no lifers&quot; progress?<br />

<br />
Any rogue can soak.<br />
Fire mage can soak.<br />
Shadow priest can soak.<br />
Feral druid can soak.<br />
Any hunter can soak.<br />
Paladin can soak.<br />
Paladin and Mage can both also soak once every 5 minutes without taking any damage at all.<br />
Having a disc, holy priest or paladin allows any class to soak with psupp/wings/sac.<br />
Many other classes can soak as long as they're paired with a tank that can use t13 4p (resto/balance druid, enhancement shaman, warlock, DK etc)<br />
And of course, with battle res and ankh you can always opt to sacrifice a player and res afterward.<br />
<br />
With this many classes able to soak it really shouldn't be a problem.<br />
<br />
Death Knights can soak every what? minute? AMS is a beautiful thing.</div></div><hr />

If you have a shit raid setup considering classes, you can wipe on him endlessly, not because you or anyone in the raid sucks, but because you cannot mitigate the Hour of Twilight.<br />
<br />
On the other hand if you have a nice setup, he is nothing else but a trash mob. <br />
<br />
Horrible boss design for 10 men raiding guilds.<br />
<br />
We've done Minutes to midnight twice now on heroic mode in 10 man with several different setups, there are only a few classes that cant survive the hour of twilight some way or another.<br />
<br />
Warlock - Go destro for nether protection<br />
Rogue - Feint/CoS<br />
Druid - Barkskin + raid cooldown<br />
Mage - Iceblock or Cauterize<br />
DK - AMS + external CD<br />
Warrior - equip shield + SW<br />
Spriest - Dispersion<br />
Shaman - Shamanistic rage + raid cooldown <br />
Paladin - Divine protection <br />
Hunter - Detterence <br />
<br />
Our elemental shaman can survive it also though I'm not sure what he uses.</div></div><hr />

Pretty interesting :o<br />

Rogues can only cloak it, the only way to survive using Feint is too be Sub, which is terrible for that fight, or have a someone else use a cooldown on you, such as intervene. As that's been said, I believe anyone can survive an hour of twilight, no matter the raid comp, you always have a way to do it. Priests have guardian spirit, warriors can intervene, and some DPS roles can temporarily swap into a more defensive mode, such as bear form. An elemental shaman could quite possibly survive an hour of twilight without outside help by using the stoneclaw totem + glyph and elemental mastery + glyph, but it's very unlikely they will survive well enough, if at all, even with the nerf.</div></div><hr />

Our Ele shammy was gobsmacked when he survived it, didn't drop below 40% health iirc, I'll ask him tonight what he used, I'm guessing it was with a raid wall at the same time, divine guardian I think.<br />
<br />
One of our setups for minutes to midnight on heroic mode was:<br />
<br />
Destro lock <br />
Ele shammy<br />
Shadow priest<br />
Shadow priest<br />
Arms warrior<br />
Assassination Rogue<br />
Holy Priest<br />
Restoration Druid<br />
Feral Druid<br />
Protection Pala</div></div><hr />

<br />
-20% with ele glyph. 204000<br />
-10% while casting with AR 183600<br />
-4% from EW 176256<br />
16572 from stoneclaw = 160k~ damage, shouldnt be hard to hit that hp with fort/motw and high gear now.<br />
<br />
any kind of other external would make an ele shaman survive it comfortably like a raid wall/PW:S/intervene before HoT etc<br />
<br />
but yeh its the nerf that makes it do-able by every class, before any nerfs 300k as ele shaman would require loads and loads of externals probably leaving none for anyone else.</div></div><hr />
