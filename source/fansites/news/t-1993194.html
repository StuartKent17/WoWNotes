No, It's a bullshit micro-transaction that doesn't deserve to be in a P2P MMO in the first place which gouges players and jumps noobs straight into near max level content with very little knowledge about their class or even the game itself.</div></div><hr />

Yep, this seemed to be a beta announcement interview, with an overview on everything that has been added and worked on since Blizzcon. This was all new info to people who don't live on MMO-C and haven't been reading every piece data mined info.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But druids can stealth, and tauren can be druids.<br />
<br />
Also now that combat has received more direction and go more with the Pirate theme... I would to point out Mr. Spite, a pirate, and a tauren. So Tauren should be able to be rogues.<br />
<br />
How do you justify worgen and goblins being the only ones unable to be a monk?<br />
<br />
Some reasons make sense (sort of) but at this point you'd be hard pressed not to have an equally persuasive counter argument.</div></div><hr />

1. What do you want them to talk about? There are new arenas. They have a pvp tree that they are still working on. They didn't mention they're working on new talents either. They don't have to :P<br />
2. They mentioned this before...I can't seem to find the post but it will work like WoD.<br />
3. They are probably still discussing how that'll work internally.<br />
4.If they havn't said anything about new dungeons by this point, don't get your hopes up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm with you. IMO &quot;heirlooms&quot; should have just been an account EXP toggle, because getting new loot is what makes playing exciting and having all your armor for 100+ levels stomps all over that. I'm not sure if scaling is the perfect solution, because I know some people are &quot;bads&quot; and need to over level stuff to enjoy the game (which is fine IMO). I'd like scaling where you are +3 levels by default (slightly over leveled), but then mobs get 1 level higher per +10%EXP you have (or something like that, numbers pulled out of the air). In any case the important part is they want to fix it. <br />
<br />
I found the best way to make leveling interesting right now is to use an EXP/Hour addon and challenge yourself to always try and beat your previous level time. Literally a race! Either that or do it for the zone story and lore, and not pay attention to your level. I swap back and forth depending on if I've done a zone already or if it's been so long I don't remember it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The affix modifier will change the dungeons in some way. Every week is different but its the same modifier per server so you can't &quot;hunt&quot; down an easier modifier. Modifiers are things like, mobs require more threat to hold onto, mobs will explode when they die, mobs are stronger if they are close to other mobs, etc. There are some that effect bosses as well, I just can't remember any. I believe there are 12-15 altogether. The dungeon can have 1-3 affixes depending on the level of your keystone (which effects the difficulty of the dungeon.</div></div><hr />

Nope, because of how players are in such a rush to complete it.<br />
See, that is why the boost exists and will sell.</div></div><hr />

Every week is different but its the same modifier per server so you can't &quot;hunt&quot; down an easier modifier. Modifiers are things like, mobs require more threat to hold onto, mobs will explode when they die, mobs are stronger if they are close to other mobs, etc. There are some that effect bosses as well, I just can't remember any. I believe there are 12-15 altogether. The dungeon can have 1-3 affixes depending on the level of your keystone (which effects the difficulty of the dungeon.<br />

Sure it does, originally, &quot;beta&quot; meant something that works to some degree and you can have fun with. Now, thanks mostly to Google, &quot;Beta&quot; means well, but not thoroughly tested. If you play the beta you should get close to the experience leveling to 110 as you would at release. End game content sounds like it will still need some tuning though.<br />

They play a normal character, so once that cat is out the bag there is nothing they can really do about it, short of a character rename.<br />
And even a rename should it remain in the same guild wouldn't be hard to track down.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baronthefirst</div><div class="date">2016-05-10, 06:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So the problem I see is that the developers ruined WoW to get players to max level faster. Lower the entry level barrier. The first mistake they made was thinking that Warcraft was only about the end game. Sure it is, was ,and will be great to get to level cap but it is always supposed to be a journey. (Spoiler) That journey doesn't exist in the 8 to 10hrs it takes to level in Legion. All the focus is on what can you do to get artifact power as fast as possible then on to your off-spec. <br />
<br />
I want Legacy realms because the world actually mattered. I got to experience the zones. Fall in love with some of them and even hate to have to move on. That is why Blizzard failed. Leveling should matter. It should build memories and immerse you in the world. Don't get me started on the character boosts. Those are toxic in and of themselves to new players. They just got robbed of seeing an entire 12 years of work so they could jump right into the smallest land mass for any expansion to date. The Broken Isles.<br />
<br />
Oh and glad I didn't go crazy with my Alpha characters and artifact power. I knew this character wipe was coming.</div></div><hr />

no they did not... it was still suppost to release augest, they were hoping for a long beta, but beta is ussauly polished and mostly finished, so they named it alpha... it was never ment to be Q1, beta came out in the following weeks like they said, but was called &quot;Alpha&quot; since it was still missing alot of stuff</div></div><hr />

I can't tell if you're being ironic and claiming the rewards I'd like ppl to get already exist? Sure you get some small things from leveling you might not get with insta cap but those rewards are all pretty worthless tbh and nothing you can't go grind the shit out of once you've insta capped (way faster like that btw), if you even care do so. <br />
<br />
My point is leveling is boring and rly unrewarding in WoW and that's with how fast it is now. I think if someone has the will to do it at a much slower rate from 1 to 110, they should get something cool that's relevant at the end of their ordeal, like a title or mount or maybe a choice of rewards, like the lvl 50 quests in vanilla. Would be cool to level toons just to collect the new rewards.</div></div><hr />

Alpha - Changing a lot of stuff down to the mechanics of the game. Perfect time to test and get feedback on class overhauls.<br />
Beta - Changing numbers to achieve the balance, don't fuck around with the mechanics anymore to get feedback to make the release good.<br />

yes but they need to go back and farm those, if they added something into the game a leveled char could get, a boosted char 100% could not get, no one would EVER boost.... so no. no matter what they added, a max level could just go get... but still, somone leveling does get these things just as they level</div></div><hr />

<br />
The &quot;new player&quot; pool for WoW is pretty darn slim. So that's an unlikely thing to occur. Most players leveled exactly the way you describe but 1 expansion at a time. Providing a skip option for new people on 100 levels just gives blizz a better chance at retaining a new player past the lvl 20 starter edition. Besides, have you tried leveling an alt recently? It's a barren wasteland. If I was new I sure wouldn't stick it out, I'd assume it was a dead game because I never saw anyone.<br />

you do know you need to level to 20 (no boost no nothing) to get liadrin for hearthstone, and even wow vets complained.... 20 WITH HEIRLOOMS and people hated being forced to level... imagine forcing people to level ANOTHER TOON they DONT WANT to get these rewards</div></div><hr />

I got to experience the zones. Fall in love with some of them and even hate to have to move on. That is why Blizzard failed. Leveling should matter. It should build memories and immerse you in the world. Don't get me started on the character boosts. Those are toxic in and of themselves to new players. They just got robbed of seeing an entire 12 years of work so they could jump right into the smallest land mass for any expansion to date. The Broken Isles.<br />

It's like you haven't paid attention to anything they're doing with the world content this go around.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
so your saying &quot;give more reward to somone who levels then somone who boosts&quot;<br />
<br />
meanwhile somone who levels gets<br />
<br />
Extra gold<br />
Profession training<br />
tons of transmog as any item you get/quest you complete gets added<br />
acheivs from transmog, quests, exploration<br />
cool transmogs from doing quests like some of the awesome weapons from BC/wrath quests<br />
<br />
again you are claiming leveling sucks cause it doesent reward what you wants, well MANY MANY others love to level, the first few times, then rather skip<br />
<br />
You're one of those people who doesn't think there's anything wrong with the game the way it is. You think that if we add a mount or title for people who level the old school way from 1 to 110 it's catering to filthy 'casuals' or giving 'entitled' players like me rewards they don't deserve, while forcing you to do something you don't want to because you've probably got 10 lvl 100's. What a miserable state of mind. People like you are the reason the game is dying.<br />
<br />
It wouldn't hurt anything or anybody to add a real reward for the lvl ing process that even veterans might want. This game need new vitality, saying it's fine the way it is bullshit. It's not fine the way it is and the sub numbers show that.</div></div><hr />

Alpha - Changing a lot of stuff down to the mechanics of the game. Perfect time to test and get feedback on class overhauls.<br />
Beta - Changing numbers to achieve the balance, don't fuck around with the mechanics anymore to get feedback to make the release good.<br />
<br />
So if you feel your class/spec is shit, it most likely won't change until 8.0<br />

Well if a completely optional reward is consider forcing... then looking at a woman is rape.<br />
I don't care that you fuckwhits think you have ocd and need every little reward this games offers, but it's the only way to give leveling back a bit of reward for new players.<br />

They are justifying a nerf to the rate at which you can level a character because of boosts that they're selling for $60. It's nothing but bald faced greed. They should make levelling content F2P if they're going to do that.</div></div><hr />

lol... yeah ok say as much as you need to say... were here.. dont worry... cry all you need<br />
<br />
there is plenty wrong with the game, anyone can tell you that... and adding a mount/title to leveling the normal way is stupid, as most people use heirlooms so that reward would be like 2 days of work... the issue with these rewards, is that they would have to be 1 of two things<br />
<br />
give it to people who have allready leveled normally, meaning 99% of the current playerbase would have it allready<br />
<br />
or force people to level another char to 100, forcing alot of players to spend days on something their going to delete after... or never touch ever again...</div></div><hr />

again as im saying, if you want X reward you have to do that... and as i said AGAIN AND AGAIN the liadrin test was a failure, people hated it, and that was only level 20, so forcing people to level to get a reward even after they have done it time and time again, or have nothing else to do in it, wont work<br />
<br />
and dont go &quot;aww your saying forced again&quot; cause if you WANT the liadrin hero you are FORCED to level cause there is no OTHER way to get it<br />
<br />
what your trying to say is im saying &quot;oh your FORCED to pay money to get cards in hearthstone&quot; no, cause you can get them by farming gold, what im saying is IF YOU WANT THE REWARD YOU HAVE TO LEVEL and we allready know, making people have to do something they have done many of times, is not a good idea</div></div><hr />

You don't have to? You have to buy the WoW battle chest which includes all the old content but you can't even buy any old exp separate from that. You buy &quot;Wow&quot; (which includes everything prior to the current exp) and then the current exp.</div></div><hr />

again if you read, im not saying the optinal content is forced, im saying to GET THE REWARD that optinal content is forced, and its fine if its new, but if its added to somethign people did 12 years ago, no one is going to accpet it... imagine if they suddenly added bonuses to old dungeons from BC and wrath but you had to level a toon to go back and do those? couldnt be on a max level toon</div></div><hr />

Yes if I want the reward, I have to do the thing to get the reward. If I want the Gold Medal of 100 Meter sprinting, I have to win the 100 meter sprint. Amazaing how that works right?! Doing the think you get the reward, gets you the reward! OMFG, give that man a nobel prize! Genius!<br />

again why are you here if you hate wow and its player? here, i will give you a gold medal if you shit in your diaper? what you did it like a hundred times when you were ab baby, why wont you do it now? oh cause you should have gotten it when you did it then, and dont wanna have to do it now? oh well too bad<br />
<br />
the issue is people are done with leveling, tons of people have allready done it, leveled all the chars they want, and dont want rewards locked behind doing old content, adding REWARDS to OLD CONTENT that people have allready done 1-22+ TIMES does not bode well... look at the BC raid pets... most people dont wanan spend the time to go back and farm them cause they allready did those raids hundredss of times for transmogs, so why go back just for a pet wasting their time...<br />

Nothing they're claiming is refuting that Order Hall is Garrison 2.0. All they're doing is shifting the focus.<br />
<br />
Garrison had &quot;quests and dailies that sent you outside&quot;.<br />
Garrison was a &quot;gate&quot; for unlocking quests and content in the world, just as Order Hall will be.<br />
Horde Garrison was a piece of shit, so expect some class halls to be a piece of shit for the entire expansion.<br />
<br />
Everything else said about the Garrison and Order Hall is irrelevant fluff. They're just using semantics to coast through criticism instead of addressing it. After Ashran how can anyone take the current content devs seriously?<br />
<br />
Blizzard has reached the level of affluenza where &quot;PR money&quot; is more important than customer money. They might as well get rid of the official forums because all it's used for is tech support complaints. They don't even care about bug reports anymore unless you're some high-status streamer neet.<br />

Garrison had &quot;quests and dailies that sent you outside&quot;.<br />

they said beta at the end of blizzcon... so how could they have suckered people into it? also beta did come in the following weeks, it was called ALPHA<br />
<br />
also you dont need to be subbed or pre-order to get into beta, MANY people who dont even have wow have gotten into the alpha...<br />
<br />
have you actuallty looked out in the world? class halls are very differant... they are optinal, they have quests, but the researching, and the artifacts, and the world quests, are all IN THE WORLD <br />

they said &quot;beta this year&quot; at the end of gamescon, but beta has never been &quot;buy blizzcon&quot; or &quot;buy the game&quot; without it being announced first... they dont suddenly go &quot;oh yeah suprise all yall in beta!&quot; if it was going to happen they would have put it on the box to sell more...<br />

<br />
there is plenty wrong with the game, anyone can tell you that... and adding a mount/title to leveling the normal way is stupid, as most people use heirlooms so that reward would be like 2 days of work... the issue with these rewards, is that they would have to be 1 of two things<br />
<br />
give it to people who have allready leveled normally, meaning 99% of the current playerbase would have it allready<br />
<br />
or force people to level another char to 100, forcing alot of players to spend days on something their going to delete after... or never touch ever again...<br />
<br />
Not crying and not claiming this solution will solve the entire problem but not everything requires a complete revamp and Blizz has made it very clear they have no intention of doing anything major, not now, not ever. There's only so much you can do and if you say lvl ing from 1 to 110 is going to take double the time it takes now or however long I think it's fair for those brave enough to actually do it to get a nice reward that isn't already in game and that you can't just farm asap once you've insta capped. You hate the idea because you're an obvious 'have it all' and the idea you might have to level another toon for that 1 reward pisses you off. You're the entitled brat here.<br />
<br />
And to the guy saying there's no new players in WoW anymore and Heirlooms just let you face roll everything. I know. They should nerf heirlooms along with the leveling rate so it isn't such a game breaking advantage and whoever wants to do the content the way it was once meant to be played does, the rest find $60 somewhere to do 0 effort.</div></div><hr />

Also the class hall order sets lists one of the critera is &quot;Complete the Broken Shore Leveling Questline.&quot; I suppose the Instance could be considered a 'questline&quot; but it's really just a scenario...

This has never been the definition of Alpha/Beta. I know you keep popping up in posts claiming that it is, but just because you say it doesn't make it true.

For active buffing: You need to think for that, can't have that. What if Joe who works 12 hours a day in the factory wants to enjoy some WoW and forgets to buff and doesn't perform optimally, that would be a shame, so remove it!</div></div><hr />

I'm just going by the summary on MMO-Champ, so... does Ion actually say &quot;it is going away&quot; in those words? Or are you referring to the bit in the summary that says &quot;After release you go to Dalaran to pick things up?&quot;<br />
<br />
Cuz if it's the bit about Dalaran, I don't think that means Broken Shore is going away. I read it as &quot;You do Broken Shore before release, and then after release you go to Dalaran&quot;. You have already done Broken Shore by release, so you go to Dalaran next. For players doing it after release it would just be &quot;do Broken Shore then go to Dalaran&quot;.</div></div><hr />

What I'm looking at is the limited number of tanks and healers for dungeon runs, and how to fill this potential massive void when you have people various different keystone stages, for example, you have a guild group of 4 people, 3 dps and 1 healer at a +7 keystone level, but can only find a tank that is at a 3 keystone level to fill their group need, or a tank at a +10 keystone level who cant find a group that is within a +3 keystone level to the tank, are these groups now forced to spend time trying to get someone to their point of mythic keystone progression or sitting in LFG hoping someone will join their group in their keystone range which while competing with who knows how many groups looking for similar needs since. by my understanding this just seems like its going to lead to a massive WoW forum screaming fit that could rival Cata dungeon difficulty whining days once everyone gets into the Legion features after launch. if I'm misunderstanding things, I would be grateful for a proper explination about this new mythic feature.<br />
I bring this up simply because I see no mention about the keystones scaling to highest or lowest in group, just how affix are pre set to all realms</div></div><hr />

The dungeon difficulty and rewards will be based on the party leader's keystone.<br />

I'm not sure if everyone's keystone gets upgraded upon dungeon completion, or if only the leader's keystone gets upgraded.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mmoc925aeb179c</div><div class="date">2016-05-10, 09:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Also considering how large this pre-patch event is, you'd think they'd want people to enjoy it longer than just one month, then its gone.<br />
<br />
But here's what confuses me: A month ago Watcher said the Broken Shore functions as Legions' version of Assault on the Dark Portal&quot; in Tanaan. That the Broken Shore instance is the introduction to leveling in Legion, so that part of the pre-event would be sticking around throughout the expansion.<br />
<br />
But today, in the Dev Update, Watcher is now saying the Broken Shore instance is going away forever on August 30th. What? Why?<br />
<br />
Also the class hall order sets lists one of the critera is &quot;Complete the Broken Shore Leveling Questline.&quot; I suppose the Instance could be considered a 'questline&quot; but it's really just a scenario... Is the Broken Shore getting replaced with a leveling zone at launch or something? A Whole additional questing zone we've never heard about before now?<br />
<br />
The pre event is going away on the 30th and that's doing stuff all over Azeroth and getting some loot before Legion.<br />
<br />
The quest for order halls requires you to do the scenario, which will always be there.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ComputerNerd</div><div class="date">2016-05-10, 09:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;The team made leveling through previous expansions faster to reduce the barrier to entry for people that want to catch up and play with their friends. The Character Boost system solves this problem, so there is no need to rush players through leveling anymore.&quot;<br />
<br />
I read this as &quot;leveling used to be easy, now that you can pay 60 dollars for a character boost, prepare for it to be much harder&quot;<br />
<br />
They have a point.<br />
Go through the levelling experience nowadays, and see just how many of the experienced players actually are wanting to take their time.<br />
It is rush, rush, rush all the time.<br />
They don't even stop that at level cap, with dungeons still being about being in and out as quickly as possible.<br />
Look at Everbloom with the shortcut for instance.<br />
<br />
<br />
I love their excuses for not releasing beta when the said they would. If morons expect beta to be a demo you don't cater to those morons. You simply inform them that beta testing is a process designed to allow developers to locate and address bugs before the product fully launches. <br />

This isn't about plans changing because something new came up. This is about Blizzard not thinking things through before they announce them.<br />

I'm sorry. Here's the wikipedia quote: &quot;Beta phase generally begins when the software is feature complete but likely to contain a number of known or unknown bugs&quot;.<br />
<br />

<br />
See that generally part? That means there's no set definition. Each company defines their testing phases in their own way.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm not sure if everyone's keystone gets upgraded upon dungeon completion, or if only the leader's keystone gets upgraded.<br />
<br />
well that seems a bit more reasonable, though I would hope that everyone gets a keystone upgrade, even if its only a +1 to their own keystone</div></div><hr />

if they do it right and copy GW2 and/or SWTOR leveling systems which it very much appears like they are testing with Legion, I don't think much will change other than you could level through entire zones with the xp rewards still being worth while</div></div><hr />

and i feel those systems will completly and totaly fuck up people who do not already have ton of alts - it wont fuck up altoholicks with 40 alts it will screw those with 4-5 who would like to get 6th but now they will have to put in 200-300 hours or pay up 50 euro - its financial scam :/</div></div><hr />

Forgive me but I don't see how it would be a problem in that regard--people had multiple alts before the systems were revamped in Cata--it would just be making the classic questing a better experience in general. A little less disjointed, probably a little more rewarding. In either event, I should have clarified that when I mentioned 'systems' I was thinking about the keystone challenge mode and the world quest things they're putting into Legion.</div></div><hr />

Don't you have to stack RAF - which costs almost as much as the damn boost - with the elixirs in order to do that? =\<br />

- not to mention you have to keep the other toon within 3 levels, which of course leads to massive amounts of automation to turn in quests efficiently, which is likely to result in banned accounts if you're not a big time streamer...</div></div><hr />

The RAF was very overkill, but having plus 450% exp, you can lvl extremly fast. Like, if you lvl as a tank, you can speedrun all the dungeons with extreme speed.... All i am saying is that the lvling process is very fast atm, even with just the 55% heirloom gear. I don't think it would hurt that much to extend the lvling process and maybe make it a better experience overall.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, I was gonna say... I don't see how they can assert that &quot;Tauren rogues don't make sense&quot; at the same time that they force Combat spec into a pirate theme. Isn't Fleet Master Seahorn one of the most famous pirates on Azeroth?</div></div><hr />

<br />
That was directed towards max level, not below. They even said (And were quoted in the list) that it would be too long for lower levels. I honestly don't agree, it could be 30 second fights and still be substantially rewarding and a good experience. But I can understand why not, especially when they admitted to saying the game doesn't have enough abilities to be interesting while leveling. This speaks volumes honestly and I'm glad they are self aware, but damn is this way too late.</div></div><hr />

He's become popular with the Cata Beta together with TB, he had a yt channel called OMFGCATA where he did WoW commentary stuff, but has basically quit WoW a long while ago. It's probably like the WoW devs don't play or love the game, so they pick someone who doesn't play or love the game as an interview host.</div></div><hr />

It helps that he is a massive blizzard fanboy (almost to shill levels) who is constantly complaining about the little things, but would never critique them honestly .. and supposedly knows some devs, etc.. Hardly surprising that they didn't went for someone who would or just could ask &quot;problematic&quot; questions after WoD ;).<br />
<br />
Lol btw at the beta excuse. People only expect that because bullshit spewing marketing wankers like they have at blizzard conditioned people to think that. Giving beta only to a select few high ranking players and (new) media people certainly didn't paint that picture anyway, right? :p</div></div><hr />

Like, if you lvl as a tank, you can speedrun all the dungeons with extreme speed.... All i am saying is that the lvling process is very fast atm, even with just the 55% heirloom gear. I don't think it would hurt that much to extend the lvling process and maybe make it a better experience overall.<br />
<br />
I've gone through leveling almost 15 times and if I happen to roll another character I sure as fuck don't want to be spending much longer than it takes now getting it to max. And I'm DEFINITELY not wasting money on a boost.

<br />
So the pace is where it should be? So outlvling an area, before you are even close to finishing the zone-storyline is alright? Right now, the leveling experience is broken and even if you try to handicap yourself(no looms, nothing to help you lvl), you still outlvl zones before you are really done with them. It gives a crappy experience as both new and old players, since the paceing is so bad.<br />
<br />
Since you have lvled so many characters, i understand why you don't really want to do the lvling content anymore, but aint that also a call to make the lvling experience fun again? To have it change into something new and, maybe, exiting? :) I personally was pretty done with lvling when Cata hit, yet the revamped zones really made me like lvling again. Don't you think a completly new lvling system would reignite that lost lvling flame? :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
the issue is people are done with leveling, tons of people have allready done it, leveled all the chars they want, and dont want rewards locked behind doing old content, adding REWARDS to OLD CONTENT that people have allready done 1-22+ TIMES does not bode well... look at the BC raid pets... most people dont wanan spend the time to go back and farm them cause they allready did those raids hundredss of times for transmogs, so why go back just for a pet wasting their time...<br />

<br />
<br />
lol... ok sure :P &quot;i will make claims but refuse to provide evidence&quot; get lost man<br />
<br />
...Seriously, rewards are aimed at those that want them enough to do the content required. How is that hard to get? Fuck the people that don't want the rewards enough, those people shouldn't dictate how Blizzard create their games...since then, we end up with an expansion like WOD!<br />
The battle pets added to old raids added incentive, and tons of people that don't have a problem with running those raids over and over are selling the pets to those lazy bums that CBA to run the content. More options, more content and more incentive is always better. Fuck the people that don't want to do content if it's a repeat of previous actions due to add or some shit...those people shouldn't even play an mmorpg since EVERYTHING is a repetition in these games beyond the first play through...be it PvP or pve.<br />
Unique rewards for higher difficulty leveling seems like a great idea to me, I'd gladly do the content required if the rewards are great. I have 33 chars at 100.</div></div><hr />

So you think that YOUR personal needs are above the needs of overall comunity, and what is actually healthy for both new players first impression, and the game itself? If yes, you can go already, cause we as a comunity don't give a fuck about some random dude with 15 characters already, who want to level up more.

How do you know that? There are more than enough altoholics out there. If you don't want to level fast - fine, don't use heirlooms etc. Stay in a zone if you want to finish it before moving on.

First, WoW was never casual compared to other MMOs, it just gave different experience. Second, WoW started bleeding subscribers, the moment blizzard changed their design philosophy from &quot;all content is relevant, and cool rewards go to better players&quot; to &quot;only latest content is relevant, and most cool rewards are available to everybody&quot;.

<br />
At least with his point he does not bother the current system.If you are a new player and want to speed to max lvl you have a boost,if you want to lvl fast cuz boost is to price,you can do it in like 1,2 day's(even buying the token and geting the hierlooms,is a cheeper solution for the 50$ alternative).If you want to lvl the old school way,then dont wear the loom's,dont use xp potions,end of story.<br />
<br />
Seriously the game is so big that anyone can find for them self something to do.No one is forcing you to do anything.<br />
Someone unhappy that the game is not catering solely to their whims is dragging others down.<br />
Be mature enough to just leave it alone, instead of being hellbent on hurting the experience of others.</div></div><hr />

Not even true. WoW subscribers stayed at a stable peak of 12 million all throughout WotLK. You know, the expansion that started the whole &quot;casualisation&quot; hysteria. WoW subscribers started to bleed during Cataclysm...funnily enough, that was when the first tier and the heroics were probably the hardest every.<br />
<br />
Oh, and let's not forget that WotLK didn't start catch-up mechanisms. As of patch 2.4, the final patch of Burning Crusade, all attunements on BC raids were removed and you could get T5/T6 quality gear from badges of justice from places like Karazhan. Yet subscriber numbers continued to increase after this.<br />
<br />
And before that you had Zul'Aman, the side raid that existed specifically for T5 catch up.<br />
<br />
So please, go do some research before you spread blatant misinformation.</div></div><hr />

First of all not 2.4 - 2.4.3. I remember this patch very clearly, cause mounts became lvl 30. Second, WoW started loosing subscribers right after Ulduar, and then had its historical maximum at the start of cataclysm.<br />

Why does it have to take longer, it's boring!&quot; when a big factor in why it's so boring is because you could be in a coma and still hit level 100 in 2 days. It's embarassing. Try to see the reason you find leveling boring instead of advocating it to remain what it is.<br />
<br />
Hell, go level on a private realm for an hour or two and see what happens when leveling is no longer a godmode race to the finish. Where being reckless might actually kill you.<br />
<br />
I am so glad they seem to have finally realized what has happened when they've let this snowball out of proportion. You shouldn't be a god damn demigod at level 20 just because you bought a heirloom weapon in WotLK.</div></div><hr />

Leveling has been in ruins since middle of WoTLK, since heirlooms made their appearance and developers in their infinite wisdom decided that leveling was too hard and went through it with massive nerf bat. It was single player experience void of any MMO and RPG aspects since Cataclysm when all handholding and phasing started.

When I said &quot;go do some research before you spread blatant misinformation&quot;, I meant you should actually go google this shit instead of relying on your memory, because the latter is a clear mistake. <br />
<br />
http://wowwiki.wikia.com/wiki/Patch_2.4.0<br />
<br />
Patch 2.4.0. Please note the enormous amount of nerfs in the Dungeons and Raids section...INCLUDING the removal of attunements for Hyjal, Black Temple, and Karazhan. SSC and TK had their attunements removed in an earlier patch. Evidently you do not remember this patch as clearly as you think you do.<br />
<br />
Even if it WERE 2.4.3, that patch released on 15th of July 2008. The subscriber count around that time was just under 11 million. WoW subscribers would reach their peak at the end of WotLK with 12 million. <br />
<br />
No source at all demonstates any subscriber loss in WotLK besides the brief shutdown of WoW in China, so your second claim is wrong too. <br />
<br />
As for your last; you are claiming that catch-up mechanisms that first showed up in the first quarter of 2008 have a staggered effect and thus didn't affect subscriber counts until the first quarter of 2011? You seriously are trying to argue that people just stuck around for an entire expansion and then some if they hated the removal of forced progression so much?</div></div><hr />

he said they know that there is a problem in leveling at the moment because they never adressed the issues, hopely they dont take 10 years to fix the damage of non expanding and bring out patches that fixes the leveling.

What is broken isn't that the current leveling is too fast but rather that every expansion increase the level cap. In those conditions blizzard had to reduce the amount of time needed to reach the level cap, as the true game begins there since TBC release (as the pre expansion content as always been forsaken by blizzard at each expansion release). <br />
<br />
If they increased the amount of time needed to reach the cap it would just make the leveling experience even more boring as it is now (boring content is boring, the fact that you ll complete it slower won't make it any better, that's not because the leveling is slow that people like vanilla), even though I suspect it is an attempt by blizzard to increase sales of character boost.</div></div><hr />

You could not even read, jesus. &quot;Karazhan Players will no longer need the [Master’s Key] to enter Karazhan. The gates to Karazhan will still require the Master's Key to be unlocked.&quot; You still needed at least one attuned player to enter raid. And the sole reason they've removed attunements for Hyjal and black temple, cause all 3 raids dropped tier 6 pieces.</div></div><hr />
