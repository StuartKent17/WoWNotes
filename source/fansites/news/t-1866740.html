Pirate's Day<br />
Pirates' Day (http://www.wowdb.com/world-events/398-pirates-day) is here again. The only recent change to the event is the addition of Big Bag of Booty (http://www.wowdb.com/items/116392-big-bag-of-booty). <br />

Armory Stats - Pirate's Day and Day of the Dead<br />
Today we are looking at how players are doing on the completion of Pirates' Day (http://www.wowdb.com/world-events/398-pirates-day) and Day of the Dead (http://www.wowdb.com/world-events/409-day-of-the-dead). Day of the Dead doesn't take place until November, but it is close to Blizzcon, so hopefully we will be busy with news by then.<br />
<br />
Today's data is from 2.1 million players active since August 1, 2015.<br />

Patch 6.2 - Naval Hats<br />
If you are looking for Naval themed hats for Pirate's Day, don't forget about the new hats added in Patch 6.2. There is also the Ghostly Iron Buccaneer's Hat (http://www.wowdb.com/items/127659-ghostly-iron-buccaneers-hat), which will transform you into a skeleton pirate for an hour! It is a ~37% drop from Captain Ironbeard (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/93076-captain-ironbeard) in Tanaan Jungle.<br />

Ghostcrawler Tweets<br />
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br />
Do you think you can devote too many resources trying to &quot;outdo&quot; yourself that you deliver good content but too little of it?<br />
Easily. This is a big problem in game development. I preach the mantra &quot;the enemy of good is perfect.&quot; (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/643771966315343872))<br />
<br />
In the past, being behind on content was OK (Kara, SSC, etc). Is being behind current content really an issue? What changed?<br />
The team worked hard on Ulduar, but many players weren't ready for the content and didn't participate. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/643773538571149312))<br />
We didn't want a model where later tiers saw less and less participation. Not sure that was the right call, but that was the logic (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/643773797443633152))<br />
<br />
More real talk: are MMO subs REALLY cyclical? Which has changed more: game design or gamers? Which influenced the other more?<br />
I think players have just &quot;been there / done that.&quot; RTS as a genre isn't as widespread as it used to be either. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/643824493740191745))<br />
Blizzard does fine with their MMO and RTS but the list drops off quickly after them. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/643824856442671104))<br />
Some genres seem more evergreen, principally FPS and some RPGs. MMO may need to innovate dramatically to stay vibrant as a genre. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/643824731955683328))<br />
Do you think it's because gameplay is &quot;second&quot; in MMOs (and usually dull, compared to FPS)? Or because of the &quot;casual&quot; shift.<br />
I think something about FPS gameplay is evergreen. You don't get bored of those games for some reason. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/643853434249183232))<br />

<br />
I'm confused you would have those dreams when chilton said point black the expansion is coming out around the same time as the movie. Which is June. It's mind blowing that people try to ignore the facts. Hell look at all the other expansions. They all had a year of nothing. No clue why you expected this to be any different.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes they all had a year of nothing BUTTTTTT they all had more content patches during the expansions lifespan. Which meant in 5.4 during the drought you had a little bit of 5.3 content alot of 5.2 content good amount of 5.1 story and in my opinion a strong 5.0 to go back through if you got bored and thats not even mentioning 5.4 itself. WoD has a mediocre 6.2 which is done and over with in terms of solo play, 6.1 has been said by high up devs that it shouldnt have even been called a fucking patch and a decent 6.0 launch patch. thats half the content of MoP and yet we STILL have to wait a fucking year. That doubled team size sure is working hard. If they try to make 6.2 last 1 year they will be under 2million subs.</div></div><hr />

Actually, he said the complete opposite of that, he said the release date of the expansion isn't tied at all to the release date of the movie.</div></div><hr />

They should be incorporating all those book ideas into the game to begin with. That's the reason there are so many gaps in there story telling before an expansion is released. They should give people an option rather read a book for the story or play the game. That is one of the reasons the story in Outlands sucked and now Warlords of Draenor; because they are saving that stuff for the movie. They really need to get there act together in Legion. That expansions story and content has to really surpass everything they have done and with as little as 5 zones I highly doubt they will pull it off.</div></div><hr />

The current WoW devs seem to have a phobia regarding talking anymore. Since he actually worked for Blizzard, he'd have more insight into their development process than some random baker you meet on the street who's never even heard of WoW before let alone played it. When you look for opinions, you look for people that actually know what they're talking about, not random people who can't even count to 2. Sure, his opinion may be outdated and will further be outdated come Legion, but he knows the people pulling the strings and is more likely to better comment on those people than players who often have negative views.<br />
<br />
Although, I have to say, maybe it would be best to retire Greg Street's tweets once Legion is released. By then, he'll be an expansion removed from WoW so his view would truly be more opinion than fact. For WoD, seeing his tweets are fine since he was around for the early stages of WoD, but he should be left to the LoL community when Legion hits.<br />
<br />
On another note, funny how low the achievement percentages are for things as easy as the Pirate Day and Day of the Dead achievements and yet no one says a word on those. If 100% of the player base can't do a simple holiday such as those, then why are people shocked that roughly 30% have gotten flight? Some people just can't bring themselves to do achievements regardless of the reward. Having 30% of the player base do a meta achievement is huge, especially when compared to other meta achievements.<br />
<br />
Speaking of which, any chance on a graph showing how many players completed meta achievements like Draenor Pathfinder, the various raid achievement metas, the similar dungeon metas, the holiday meta, etc, Chaud? Would be interesting to see where Draenor Pathfinder stacks up against other achievements that are also metas, especially ones that go back to WotLK compared to now. I'd also be curious how many players have completed the different mount achievements (50, 100, 250, 300) and pet achievements.</div></div><hr />

Of course it's because of the casual shift. People have went on about it for years. A real mmo won't have nearly the number of subs because the entire casual and pre teen demographic isn't interested in immersion or challenge, but it will have subs that don't change or leave for sometimes a decade en masse.<br />
<br />
Know how many times I've quit wow? Now how about eq? Ffxi? 1 and 1 to the latter. Both I had one max toon. Wow I've now quit a half dozen times and have over 30. See the difference?<br />

<br />
&quot;You don't get bored of those games for some reason&quot; is that right? I won't touch a fps with someone else's fingers. /recalls the collective groan when Titan was announced as not a mmo but a fps.<br />
<br />
I'm good on the repetitive gameplay and the community which consists of pre teens telling you how badass they are in so frequent an expletive you would think they just discovered the word.<br />
<br />
Course a cod xboxlive lobby is exactly what I compare the wow community to now due to the insanely high amount of instancing, phasing, cross realm stuff, and instant travel. It's no longer an mmo and between attracting children who's parents should not allow to use the web yet, to its gameplay lending itself to such behavior... It's been heading in that direction since bc began.</div></div><hr />

<br />
(1) LoL is not an mmo...<br />
(2) Yes its MMO-champion... and while ocassionally the front page gets news from other mmos its predominantly focused on WoW. (Look at the forums its broken down into xpac, classes, pvp, pve, professions, etc. While other mmos get a single topic for any and all things associated with that particular game. &quot;mmo-champion.com&quot; is just the domain name.<br />
(3) In regards to your questions regarding the GC hate... I hated that guy while he still worked for blizzard. I think he directly to blame for some major problems in the game. mmo-champion didn't follow him nearly as much when he actually worked at blizzard. Now he doesn't so really why should we care?<br />
<br />
Look at the guy's linked-in profile he credits himself with the last 3 xpacs cata, mop, and WoD... which have all been my least favorite.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, its REALLY fucking RICH that now he thinks LFR was a bad idea... especially since he DIRECTLY worked on that project. So its great that you were able to admit your mistakes... but you set the game down a path that is now irreparable. So thanks a lot for fucking it up... now you don't work there and couldn't possibly do anything to change it, so your admission to wrong doing means precisely DICK... now kindly FUCK OFF!<br />
<br />
Also I get that its a team effort at blizzard... but GC wasn't some lowly system specialist/programmer... he was a team lead. Which means he gets to veto bad ideas, or gives them the green light... so just because you didn't work on it, just because it wasn't your idea... doesn't mean he didn't endorse it. Which IMO might as well be the same fucking thing.<br />
<br />
GC was there at blizzard for its entire... ENTIRE decline from its highest subs. Now to say that he is solely to blame is both unfair and irrational.<br />
<br />
What I don't understand is why people PRAISE him so much? What exactly do you think he was responsible for that is worth even a modicum of praise? If he's not worth praising than why should his opinion matter? Because his recent tweets echo your thoughts about WoW? Ever consider that he just a disgruntled employee that left who has nothing good to say about his previous company? *SHOCKER* -thats a new one. Or perhaps that he is just saving face because we all actually HATED him when he worked there? Maybe saying exactly what you want to hear gives him more followers which feeds his narcissistic need to be liked?<br />
<br />
He spends an awful lot of time talking about WoW and still being hung up on WoW. As his supervisor I would quite concerned that he hasn't actually moved on from his old flame. He should really focus on LoL... but he's already started to fuck up that game too... everything this man touches turns to shit.<br />
<br />
If you want to sabotage the competition... get them to hire GC.</div></div><hr />
