Dude. Attack him personally? Have you ever read any of his outbursts?<br />

<br />
You have 14 Days. If after that time the Plane is not properly tuned, I am deleting my characters, and cancelling all of my accounts. The rest of my guild will follow suit, as will several other guilds and people that play Everquest.<br />
<br />
To be brief, I did not work my ass off, jumping through your idiotic hoops with my friends and guildmates, so I could go to a zone where only groups of 18 could enjoy the content. EVEN if past these initial moronic events I can finally get my entire guild in to raid with me, FUCK YOU GUYS. Seriously, FUCK YOU.<br />
<br />
I cannot believe this... right now I'm just so pissed off. I am sitting here in the Plane of Time, and 3/4 of my guild is just sitting around while a group of 18 is repeatedly trying to beat one of the mini ring encounters. Don't you people have ANY FUCKING DECENCY? SMEDLEY WHY DON'T YOU STOP COUNTING YOUR MONEY AND START ISSUING ORDERS?<br />
<br />
The tragic irony of creating the ultimate cockblock encounter in the form of the Rathe which requires 80 people to defeat and then to limit encounters in the Plane of Time to 18.<br />
<br />
14 Days.... after that this site will change from the most popular EQ fan site on the internet to the most popular World of Warcraft fan site on the internet. I'm done playing ball with you useless fuckers... it's my turn.<br />

That's from 2003? Who on earth is the same person after 16 years? Who hasn't said something that would get you banned in wow forums in the past 16 years outside of wow forums as well. I'm not really sure what the point is here?</div></div><hr />

He's the reason I'm not playing Classic now, to be honest. He completely fucked Paladins, and to a lesser extent Druids and Shaman. It took an expansion and a half for them to recover from the gutting they took from beta --&gt; 1.1, by which time other classes had already moved on in design. I've always been sad that the most &quot;pristine&quot; and awe inspiring time in the game was marred by his crusade. <br />
<br />
When he transitioned to more quest design, those actually improved. Had he not been such a prejudicial asshole, the entire game could have been better as he could've focused on what he was good at from the beginning, rather than focusing on trying to give entire classes their comeuppance from a previous fucking game.</div></div><hr />

This is the kind of behaviour you'd get banned for on the WoW forums.<br />
<br />
it's the kind of behavior he deserves with as badly as he fucks up the open-world maps again and again expansion to expansion, not to mention his influence on the warrior class.<br />
that's what killed WPVP, phasing.<br />
because in wrath people would be able to escape into phase envelopes if they made sure not to complete the quest progression in some areas, so it just became a fuckfest of DoT-heavy classes abusing them for free honor kills, but it was used by most as a perfect escape.<br />
this is what i hoped scenarios would replace so that there would only be one version of the open-world map that everyone was on, but then again this is blizzard, so they went the stupid way that makes the game act like it's fucking dark souls randomly matchmaking people into shards, causing this exact same mechanic abuse EVERYWHERE with shard-hopping.<br />
then they made layers, and the shit fuck-tuppled.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anyway... Blizzard clearly seen that he was a passionate person with an eye for good game design. <br />
<br />
And in fact he clearly did a good job - given that he was a founding developer of story in a game you are all using the fan site of 15 years later.</div></div><hr />

No proof, just wild speculation to get their nerd rage on because their class got nerfed.<br />
<br />
Alex is and has been one of the most important devs in WoW. Chris Metzen AND Alex were responsible for much of the world, quests and story you enjoy.</div></div><hr />
