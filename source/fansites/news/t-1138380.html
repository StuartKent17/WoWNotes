Many of the points brought up here are relevant to WoW Account security as well. Keep your plugins up to date and use an authenticator! You can get one for iPhone, Android, BlackBerry, and Windows Phone 7 (https://us.battle.net/account/support/mobile-auth-download.html) or even the physical one.<br />
<br />
Account Compromises<br />
The &quot;hacking&quot; (&quot;compromising&quot; is probably a better word, since no real &quot;hacking&quot; is going on) being seen in D3 is no different than what World of Warcraft players have been seeing for five years or so. The sad thing is, if no one bought game currency (gold, credits, whatever) from these third-party companies, then essentially no account compromises would be occurring. Compromises not done by gold selling companies are very rare indeed. They strip one player to sell to another, because it's much more efficient than &quot;farming&quot; gold. They still farm some of course, but they do it purely with compromised accounts.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, these compromisers make a lot of money off of the practice (because players buy gold) and so they have a lot of resources to use to try to get your password from you directly, or through your computer. Some of their poorly translated phishing e-mails may be laughable, but their trojans, infected websites, etc. are not funny at all.<br />
<br />
If you have the physical or mobile authenticator (both of which major banks use and charge $30+ for) the chances of you being compromised are very, very small. I've personally examined the MSInfo files of nearly all of the handful of WoW players who have actually been compromised through an authenticator, and the sheer number of backdoor programs and other malware on their systems has been mind boggling. Probably not coincidentally, these same people were also running a disturbing number of file-sharing and download programs, including ones which are commonly known to not be safe.<br />
<br />
Again, compromising game accounts is a big business in some countries. They have people on their payroll who spread false rumors of &quot;hacked through my authenticator&quot; just to try to discourage people from using them. We charge $6.50 for the physical authenticator, because that's exactly what it costs us to make them. The mobile one is free because we don't have to pay a factory to build them. Use them, and enjoy your gaming without someone mucking with your stuff. <br />
<br />
What is the concrete cause of the hackings?<br />
Well, the cause is people desiring a shortcut in their games by buying gold. If you mean the technical cause, as I mentioned previously the gold selling companies use a vast array of methods. A good friend of mine is a long time network admin (and a very good one at that), who had decided to not use an authenticator because he'd never had any security issues with his computer over the years. Well, an Adobe Flash vulnerability popped up a couple years ago, and he procrastinated applying the update by a whole week. As you can probably guess by the fact that I'm relating this anecdote, his WoW account was compromised and stripped because of that one week window.<br />
<br />
There's absolutely nothing shameful about getting compromised, these companies are good at what they do. Heck, the former head of Blizzard Customer Service had his account compromised. It's because of how devious and high-tech the gold-selling companies have gotten that we implemented the physical and mobile authenticators. We can't physically go to everyone's computer and make it safe, so we've provided a tool that does it for you.<br />
<br />
I've been a computer tech for a long time, and I've never had a single malicious security breach on any of my computers that I'm aware of, but I attached one of the very first batches of physical authenticators to my account. Why? Because no matter how good I am, sooner or later they were going to get me. But now, they can't.<br />
<br />
Are you claiming that I did not have both the dial in auth and the SMS auth?<br />
No, you had those. But neither of those are the physical or mobile authenticator, the main line of protection that is being referred to. The Dial-In and SMS are just nice additional layers of security to add to the physical or mobile.<br />
<br />
It's becoming pretty apparent that our naming scheme might be causing some confusion, and I apologize for that. I'll bring the subject up with my management, so can we review both how the devices are named and how they are presented. If you have only one authenticator on your account, you want it to be the physical or mobile, not the dial-in or SMS.

<br />
Auction House<br />
Is this intended (To gear up solely through the AH) or will the drops at the end of Hell be better adjusted to help gear up for Inferno Act 1 and so on.<br />
The auction house obviously provides an incredible service to allow for very easy trades between characters, and essentially blows out the wide range of items you could have available to you at any one time. So, in fact, the AH has to be a factor in how we drop items. On one hand you have a huge benefit because you can buy and sell items very easily, as opposed to having to post up WTS threads in the old USEast trading forums, but on the other end it does impact the item pool economy with the inherent ease at which you can trade items. If the AH existed but wasn't a factor at all into how items dropped/rolled, the economy would be completely tanked within a matter of weeks.

Sometimes I feel kind of bad that I run an ad blocker. I want to give the websites I visit the revenue to help them operate, but it's stories like this that make me glad that I do run one. Honestly, it only takes a single malicious ad making it past the ad rotation company's screener to infect tons of people. You couple that with the fact that Adobe/Macromedia have the worst update system in the woooooorld. You only receive notification of updates when your computer boots. For people like myself, and most likely that network admin in question, I rarely restart my machine, and consequently, I rarely see that update window. <br />
<br />
It is possible to update manually; however, when you run the executable manually, it doesn't really check your version. You can run it twice in a row, and it will want to update both times.<br />
<br />
So... long live Adblock Plus and NoScript!</div></div><hr />

Well My physical authenticator worked for about a month. After that I had to resynchronize it via support call every three days. I like security... but that was a little overkill.<br />

The question asked about the D3 AH and fixing Hell gear so it doesn't need to be completely utilized to progress in Inferno was NOT answered at all. He only talked about how the AH is a useful source of gear. Well DUH, but shit costs so much that you have to farm the crap out of gold to buy a single good item unless you are lucky to find some dummy who posted low. I know (level 60 Barb here) I can't do anything, at all, without good resist gear which is so ridiculously expensive. I've only managed to solo Act 1 Inf, which is a feat to me.</div></div><hr />

You need some kind of identification to remove it. Please read this (http://www.skullsecurity.org/blog/2012/battle-net-authentication-misconceptions) to see why case sensitivity makes no difference in this case.</div></div><hr />

I imagine that all of the new music for this expansion will have Asian elements, but there are parts of the music that sound primarily Western. The rest of WoW will have the same music that we have come to know and love over the years.</div></div><hr />

You are missing the point. Blizzard is responsible for secure servers and services. What is going on on your system has nothing to do with them. That is what the authenticator is for - preventing your account from being compromised through eg malicious software (which in fact, the consumr is in most cases responsible for).</div></div><hr />

He's not missing the point at all actually. He is spot on about Blizz should be including the extra layer of security in the shipped out (or downloaded) product. He is also spot on about including that cost in the price of the game. That being said, people are having their accounts compromised even when they are protected by either the physical or mobile authenticators, the blue even admits it. With that fact alone, Blizzard should stop blaming the users and start looking more closely at what is actually going on. The blame game helps absolutely no one.</div></div><hr />

Maybe, maybe not. All I am saying is that it's kinda frustrating at this point that Blizzard's dancing all around the phrasing, hinting/suggesting that authenticator is mandatory without actually saying it is mandatory (because otherwise they need to point it out at every step, like when opening bnet accounts and people would think twice about opening accounts and buying games), instead keep offering this second layer of security as optional.<br />
They themselves bring up the example of the Adobe Flash vulnerability - show me one person who hasn't got flash installed with his browser. That is not a malware or suspicious software. All in all, they should be the ones making the product as safe as possible. If they gotta add authenticator to every bnet account to make it so then they should do it. Or if they intend to keep it optional, notify the user at every step they take without the authenticator that they are vulnerable and do so only at own risk.<br />
But first just simply stop preaching it as mandatory while they keep offering it as optional.</div></div><hr />

&quot;If you have the physical or mobile authenticator (both of which major banks use and charge $30+ for) the chances of you being compromised are very, very small. I've personally examined the MSInfo files of nearly all of the handful of WoW players who have actually been compromised through an authenticator, and the sheer number of backdoor programs and other malware on their systems has been mind boggling.&quot;<br />

This is talking about the Blizz authenticator. The point is that playing the blame game helps absolutely no one. Compromised accounts have skyrocketed since the release of D3. I have no doubt that many of these were due to user error. I also have no doubt that many may not have been due to user error. Something else may be going on here, something that cannot be controlled by the user and I think Blizzard is too quick to place the blame solely on the user. Blizzard is approaching this with the wrong mindset and it may come back around to stab them in the back.</div></div><hr />

If you've been playing for a while you know the recent account compromises at the release of D3 is not new in any way, shape, or form. Every expansion or release comes with a definite jump in hacked accounts so no, there's nothing going on here. People will never admit to being careless and dumb with their account security and they will always look to blame Blizz or anyone else except themselves.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BigToast</div><div class="date">2012-05-28, 06:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Again, my apologizes, so the authenticator was the blizz one, but, like they said, the computer was a trojan/malware mess. All evidence points to personal responsibility when it comes to account security. The point is that it is not an issue on blizzard's end, its an issue on the players end to combat the relentlessly ruthless hackers and we have the tools to do it. Now I wan't paying too much attention pre-launch to see if Blizz warned D3 players adequately about account security. A lot of players aren't wow players and don't know how these hackers work, so maybe they should have warned these people better. Regardless, the Blizzard servers aren't compromised, individual's computers are. So until there's a program that has Ghostcrawler's head pop up with a warning whenever one does something that may compromise their security, the onus is on the player, not the game.</div></div><hr />

They sell the authenticator for exactly what it costs to produce them, and the mobile authenticator is free. Additionally, they've given away free authenticators to people who have gotten their accounts compromised.</div></div><hr />

I've been a computer tech for a long time, and I've never had a single malicious security breach on any of my computers that I'm aware of, but I attached one of the very first batches of physical authenticators to my account. Why? Because no matter how good I am, sooner or later they were going to get me. But now, they can't.<br />

That doesn't sound right...</div></div><hr />

When I first saw this armor set &quot;Illidan Stormrage&quot; shot into my brain. I don't really play a Warlock but Illidan is my favorite Warcraft character and this set here just makes me want to roll Warlock from the start of Mist of Pandaria. Fingers are still crossed they bring him back.</div></div><hr />

<br />
now that i've had a closer look yes it does have some inspiration from Illidan and also contains a little bit of the nemesis design in there. <br />
<br />
the terror guard looks pretty awesome. i wonder though if you can enchant it's weapons? i doubt it...<br />
<br />
Demonic Gateway... first impressions, awesome! i can already see some possibilities in pvp :D<br />
the you aren't getting any mail trolling is pretty cool lol!<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm very jealous of the whole Warlock class in MoP. Though, all these updates for locks are deserved, they were the most boring class for me.<br />
<br />
looks like warlocks will be viable again. for a long while they have been under powered. now it looks like we may get to be top of the food chain again :D</div></div><hr />
