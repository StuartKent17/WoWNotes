<br />
Legion - Dev Interviews<br />
There are a few more interviews from the Legion Summit that we didn't get in our first pass (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/5756-Legion-Summit-Dev-Interviews). <br />
<br />
<br />
The team can't give us details on Thal'dranath (Millenium (http://www.millenium.org/wow/legion/actualites/legion-interview-de-cory-stockton-irvine-studios-blizzard-developpeurs-legion-145046))<br />
Wrathion won't be appearing in Legion (Blizzplanet (http://warcraft.blizzplanet.com/blog/comments/2016-legion-summit-blizzplanet-interview-cory-stockton-julian-morris))<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Kotaku<br />
<br />
Kotaku (http://kotaku.com/blizzard-talks-world-of-warcraft-legacy-servers-and-mor-1781753136) had the chance to talk to Tom Chilton and Chris Robinson.<br />
<br />
Development<br />
<br />
The lack of content in Warlords was in part due to the team thinking that Legion would be ready sooner. <br />
The development team has grown, but the larger team was able to produce more content rather than produce content faster. <br />
There are 235 people on the World of Warcraft development team now, including artists, designers, engineers, and producers.<br />
In Warlords development, the new character models were a significant pressure for the character art team. <br />
For Legion, the updated combat animations are a significant pressure for the animation team. <br />
<br />
<br />
Ship Expansion<br />
<br />
The team has talked about doing a ship-oriented expansion internally several times. <br />
You could get a boat, upgrade it, sail around to places. <br />
There would be lots of tech and art challenges. <br />
Delivering an expansion like that while keeping the core gameplay is a significant challenge. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The Starting Zone<br />
<br />
The Starting Zone (http://thestartingzone.com/ep154/) had the opportunity to do a few different interviews. <br />
<br />
Misc<br />
<br />
If you play for 1 - 2 hours you would get as much Artifact Power as you would from 10 - 12 hours of gameplay at a certain Artifact Knowledge level. <br />
<br />
<br />
Pre-Expansion Patch and Release<br />
<br />
The pre-expansion patch has lots of new technology the team will be testing. <br />
The game will automatically create new instances in an intelligent way. <br />
If you are near your friends, both of you will be in the same instance and you won't be able to tell anything happened. <br />
There shouldn't be any stutter when this happens or queues to log in in and play. <br />
This process was more manual during the Warlords launch.<br />
The team has tried to identify every bottleneck people might come across when questing at launch so that there is no standing in line to finish a quest.<br />
<br />
<br />
Scaling Leveling Zones<br />
<br />
The team will take a look at how the leveling zones scaling works out in Legion and see if it would work out well on older zones. <br />
Scaling might look like grouping the zones so that not every single zone scales for the full range of levels. There are many different ways it could be implemented with older content. <br />
<br />
<br />
Story and Lore<br />
<br />
The Illidan story never felt wrapped up. The team felt that there was more story to tell and a greater destiny. <br />
The team often talked about what Illidan was doing at Black Temple and the motivations behind his actions. <br />
The Burning Legion story has to continually escalate and it has been a long time since they invaded Azeroth. <br />
The changes in the faction leader stories in Legion came from it being time for a change. <br />
Anduin is going to have one of the more compelling stories in World of Warcraft. <br />
The Legion is an enemy that can't be reasoned with. There is no common ground. <br />
<br />
<br />
Legion Media<br />
<br />
There will be four free comics related to Legion, touching on different aspects of the expansion. <br />
One focuses on Anduin and dealing with learning the news about his father. <br />
Another comic focuses on a King Magni story. <br />
There will also be an audio drama released before Legion (hopefully) that focuses on the events leading up to the opening cinematic. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The Demons Arrive - Cinematic Cut<br />
A short cut from the cinematic set to different music (https://www.facebook.com/SophiaShoraiMusic/posts/1012970472084524) was released this week. It shows in the previews in select theaters. <br />
<br />

Two videos that cover parts of the movie set were released.<br />
<br />
<br />

MMO-Champion Forums Moderator Recruitment<br />
Good news everyone! We're recruiting moderators for the forums again! The amount of users and posts keeps increasing and we reached the point where we need some help before the trolls take over and play Whack-a-Mod in the Darkmoon Faire. I know it sounds fun, but I'm going to assume we don't want that. <br />
<br />
Please be sure to read the entire post before applying!<br />

<br />
Warcraft Movie - Box Office Update<br />
The Warcraft Movie continues to do well internationally, with Deadline posting (http://deadline.com/2016/06/warcraft-conjuring-2-now-you-see-me-2-weekend-box-office-1201770307/) updated numbers:<br />
<br />
<br />
Warcraft estimates have been revised downwards to a $25.7M opening weekend. <br />
China is up to $145M so far (https://twitter.com/ChinaBoxOffice/status/741641652058660864), with the potential to hit $200M-$250M. <br />
Deadline claims the movie needs $500M globally to break even. <br />
It will probably be a few weeks (https://twitter.com/ManMadeMoon/status/741513025719410688) until we know more if the director's cut will be a possibility. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Blue Tweets<br />
Professions<br />
I've been hearing that you need 300 profession skill to proc profession world quests, intended for release? <br />
Yes, this is intended. Otherwise, it becomes too easy to switch professions daily to earn more world quest rewards. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/737821177624723456))<br />
<br />
Pets and Pet Battles<br />
Are the battle pets obtained from the Order Halls intended to be non-tradable?<br />
Yes, hardcore battle pet collectors will need to alt it up to complete their collections. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/737750767851831296))<br />
Are you serious? Pls reconsider this. No other activity in this game isnt doable with 1 char<br />
Fully completing many account-wide collections (transmog, achieves, mounts) require alts. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/737761941104427008))<br />
but this require a lvl 98 alt for every class and the artifacts system isn't Alt friendly<br />
Not every class has a pet associated, nor do they generally require full OH progression. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/738045787473477632))<br />
<br />
Reputation / Questing<br />
Suramar looks incredible. Having to farm mana to do quests.. not so much. Not looking forward to launch week/month with this.<br />
We are still working on tuning incoming and costs related to Ancient Mana. Any pain points you've noticed so far? (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/737820562379018241))<br />
<br />
<br />
Ghostcrawler Tweets<br />
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br />
Just curious, are the people on stage at Blizzcon for example actually programmers or just the idea guys?<br />
Very few studios employ someone just as an idea guy. Even designers have to do work at the keyboard. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/727203946662518784))<br />
I'd definitely like being an 'idea guy', what do you 'do at your keyboard', Greg?<br />
Design docs, scripting, hooking up art, changing data tables. A lot of email of course. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/727522119756582913))<br />
I'd ask about those things in greater detail but that would be a bit much outside of DMs, etc. What sort of scripting?<br />
A lot of mechanics design on WoW and LoL (and doubtless many games) are scripted. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/727667954226057216))<br />
If you want to boost damage or damage coefficients, you can do that in an editor. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/727668055262691329))<br />
If you want to special case anything (e.g. bonus damage, set bonuses, weird interactions) you script in a language like lua. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/727668358775066624))<br />
Design isn't telling engineers how things should be. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/727668462030495744))<br />
It is trying to get shit to work and then going to engineers for help when you can't make it work. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/727668557354426368))<br />

<br />
O'rly? ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) up to evidence, it realy doesnt look like WoD had any increases on part on anything, and Legion while it has more than WoD in Dungeons at Launch still has less than any prior to WoD, Legion has NO NEW Battlegrounds, and is forcibly pushing As(s)hran on us again, it might be good, it might be bad, but honestly saying that they were able to produce more content is an outright lie, when Vanilla and TBC was made by like 40-50 people, and objectively interms of ammount no Expansion has even gotten close to either of those in ammount of content.</div></div><hr />

I just did the leveling story experience through Highmountain and there was no hint of him. Unless it's a max-level quest, he's not there anymore.</div></div><hr />

Now the Legion is literally at Azeroth's doorstep, Wrathion is inextricably absent? WTF?!<br />
What kind of nonsensical decision is this? This expansion is probably the best time for him to be making an appearance. The story writers better rectify this in a later patch!</div></div><hr />

Yeah, not a flop and with DVD/BR/VoD sales it will probably make a profit. I'm worried it won't be enough profit for them to bother with another though :mad:</div></div><hr />

I'm from Blizzplanet. You can hear Cory Stockton's words in the embeded YouTube video concerning Wrathion. Yes, Wrathion was part of the Highmountain questline in Alpha. However, the developers removed Wrathion entirely from Legion when Beta testing started. Wrathion was replaced by a new black dragon that survived the War of the Ancients.<br />
<br />
Back to the interview, however, I wish to point out that Cory did not say we won't see Wrathion in Legion. In essence, put in a nutshell, Cory said he is not currently in-game.<br />
<br />
<br />
Cory Stockton: &quot;Yea, currently I don’t think he is in another place in the game.&quot;<br />
<br />
That doesn't mean Wrathion won't be added as part of a content patch later on throughout end-game Legion. After all, it was Wrathion who was preparing us for the Legion invasion since Mists.<br />
<br />
Secondly, Cory did point out that he doesn't oversees all the quests, so he is in fact admitting that he might be wrong, and Wrathion might show up at some point.<br />
<br />
<br />
Cory Stockton: He could be in. I’m not overseeing every single quest in the content</div></div><hr />

Hell, he's the one who kicked off the events leading to WoD because he was trying to build an army to defend Azeroth against the Legion.<br />
Now the Legion is literally at Azeroth's doorstep, Wrathion is inextricably absent? WTF?!<br />
What kind of nonsensical decision is this? This expansion is probably the best time for him to be making an appearance. The story writers better rectify this in a later patch!<br />
<br />
<br />
Heck he's the reason why the Legion is at our doorstep. I mean if he didn't go to Alternate Draenor, Im sure they would not have come yet.</div></div><hr />

Uh... Wrathion does appear in Legion. He's a quest giver in Highmountain. This is either an instance of Blizzplanet totally failing at journalism, or one Dev not knowing what the other zone designers are doing.<br />
<br />
I didn't do 100% completion in Highmountain but if you're talking about black dragon posing as a Tauren then that's not Wrathion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't actually blame them for killing Vol'jin. It obviously wasn't originally part of the plan, it was just gonna be Varian. But then they knee jerked this, because so many idiots have been crying about horde favoritism since Cata. So they just killed Vol'jin as well, so as not to have to hear about the stupid bullshit again. So when they say this, it's half true, and they just choose to not insult people like I am here so just include Vol'jin with the justifications as well.</div></div><hr />

I think they mean that when they used him as a boss in BC, he didn't have any development or any real motivation, wasn't really involved in the story. He was just a guy on the box that players killed in a patch. It was a complete waste of a character.<br />

It didnt sound like spells were the source of the heavy workload. By combat animations, i believe they are referring to the movements player and perhaps some npcs make when fighting/shooting/casting. Thats 26 race/gender skeletons to animate in all of those activities. Each one probably has several different movements and making a skeleton move smoothly is more complex than spell animations. Be pissed about the timetable, but dont undersell the size of the task.</div></div><hr />

If that were true then Legion would have more dungeons and raids and content than any other expansion. It doesn't. It's actually one of the lowest.

Wasn't it Kairoz, that helped him go back in time? The one you killed in the Legendary Questline?<br />
<br />
<br />
And why does everyone cry for content as if they need to provide you with 10+h/d for years because you paid em a few bucks? There was a lot to do for someone who plays around 10-20 hours a week. The leveling was really cool. The dungeons were great. I mean yeah wrath had a lot of content, but also a lot of that content was bad or boring, but noone wants to see that. I also had the most fun in BC and Wrath, not because it was better, but because it was still pretty new to me. For me WoD had 2 major issues: the garrison and needing lfr for gear progression while it should be optional so that everyone can see their raid content, but don't have to do it.<br />
Still I enjoyed WoD a lot. Yeah it got boring and I stopped a year ago to start again in august, and I'm sure I'll enjoy it too. Just don't go for the game with the expectation, that they provide as much content as you need to satisfy 10 hour sessions of gaming everyday.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wrathion was in league with Kairoz. <br />
<br />
(Copied from Wrathion's entry on WoWpedia).<br />
&quot;Wrathion, alongside his bodyguards, Right and Left, attended the trial of Garrosh Hellscream, frequently corresponding with Anduin Wrynn during intermissions. He came to acknowledge the prince of Stormwind as a personal friend, though told him that his kind heart and desire to see good in the world would be his undoing. He sat as far from Alexstrasza as he could.<br />
<br />
Eventually, Wrathion revealed himself to be working with Kairozdormu and the Infinite dragonflight to free Garrosh and send him back in time to the Draenor of thirty-five years ago. After incapacitating the Chu brothers so he could lock up Chromie for investigating Kairoz, Wrathion was confronted by Anduin, who attempted to deter his friend from freeing the captured warchief. Proclaiming that as the last of the Black Dragonflight, the protection of Azeroth now falls to him, Wrathion knocked Anduin out and took his leave. Despite his actions, Wrathion believed this would be best for Azeroth in the coming conflict with the Legion, and maintained hope that Anduin would eventually understand his motives and even stand with him as a brother when the time comes.&quot;<br />

<br />
What's it like living in a make believe land where marketing is free? How do they choose what commercials to air on the super bowl? I bet they do something like cotton candy gets thrown up in the air and the companies that catch the most get the slot.<br />

Does Blizzard never learn from their mistakes? Can they truly be this stupid? Having everyone sailing around on their own boats... that's JUST LIKE GARRISONS. It has the exact same effect of segregating players into their own little bubbles!<br />
<br />
Guild ships would be cool.</div></div><hr />

The lack of content in Warlords was in part due to the team thinking that Legion would be ready sooner.<br />
<br />
So, you charged customers $10 more for an expansion that you knew didn't have as much content because you were relying on another expansion that you hoped would be ready sooner so you could charge your customers again?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Concerns me there's a few months of content, then you get to hit the same things with your new fancy animations, for 14 months.<br />
<br />
Still, gotta remain positive eh? ;)<br />
<br />
Not only are they dealing with a new class with all the animations and spells, they have to deal with ALL the other 11 classes plus all the characters,NPCS and even monsters in the past 6 expansions in 10 years worth of game + they are updating the gear again, The expansion is just gonna be as big as WOD probably even smaller move the third tier raid to the next expansion they will say, or probably Raid tier 2 is a onyxia type battle!!<br />
<br />
I bet they are miles behind bro. They need to shut down expansions not relevant to the storyline and remove dungeons and raids to that does likewise, not even 235 team members we be able to handle this as content doesn't grow linearly they grow exponentially cause your definitely gonna miss a few characters that are game breaking.<br />
<br />
Why not make the old legacy raid as a bonus with a Legendary cosmetic that can be applied to all weapons like Rags hammer or Nef's sword or something along those lines.<br />

Nah it's more like Blizzard doesn't know what the fuck they are doing and think the Diablo III team can handle the game which is 10 times the size of Diablo III.<br />
<br />

<br />
I wish they just made these things account-wide and see our ships etc, it isn't segregating players in little bubbles it's more like here is a loot treasure chest spend 2 hours across 7 characters to claim it. They can give us something they can give us a place to log out but don't give us everything. Having the same 25 followers doing the same 500 gold missions and then have to put in a 2 million dollar mount as an award is not the way to go. WE just don't need to leave our garrisons cause they give everything bar the 30 minute venture to Nagrand to loot hides and pelts.<br />
<br />
A completed garrison event would be seeing your alts in there and the followers are account-wide or server wide only.</div></div><hr />

If that were true then Legion would have more dungeons and raids and content than any other expansion. It doesn't. It's actually one of the lowest. This &quot;biggest team ever&quot; is a lie or filled with incompetent fucks that can't produce as much as the wrath team did. And that team according to them had 1/5th the people.<br />
<br />
Not only doesn't it have more raids and dungeons, it has the least amount of zones of any expansion, unless you include the DH starting zone, than fine, it's tied with the least amount of zones ever. No new BG's, a whopping 1 new arena. <br />
<br />
However what you are 100% completely and undeniably wrong on is incompetency. They are not incompetent. 100% definitely have the ability to make more content, or same content much faster. The problem, is they spend a good chunk of their times PLAYING other video games, instead of making this one.</div></div><hr />

500 Million to break even? Hah what a joke. They used random actors, probably paid them like 500$ each , no way the whole movie cost 500 million</div></div><hr />

Just because you don't read about them in your tabloids doesn't mean they're random actors.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So you should know your lore and learn some grammar while you're at it.<br />
<br />
Well this is new, according to the gameplay storyline it was just kairoz. All Wrath wanted was a dead Garrosh, he even flips out in rage at the end of legendary cloak quest line for not killing Garrosh. Its even worse that we have to read a novel to know the real story..<br />
<br />
That aint no grammar mistake, just a typo. Relax.</div></div><hr />
