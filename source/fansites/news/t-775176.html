It looks like a huge murloc was about to eat the hunters head, but the hunter found that last gasp of courage, picked up his blade, and chopped the murlocs head off. Bottom line. I like it :D</div></div><hr />

Click the picture. Shows the whole getup and all three colors.<br />

I have to admit, that while at first I wanted to make fun of the Paladin T11, that second coloring looks good. As do the green and dark blue Murloc Men.</div></div><hr />

I agree with this, it's very cool, it just looks dumb on a human is all. The armor set was crafted by a hunter that hunter down his prey (murloc!), while harvesting the eggs and hunter down their artifacts (see the dangly things on the shoulders?). Very cool theme.</div></div><hr />

And hunter, I love it. Humans do not make best models, thats a given fact. <br />
<br />
And to anyone saying..hahaha hunters have a murloc on there head... let me inform you of 3 simple but really important things:<br />
<br />
1. Its a murloc with smoke coming out of its eyes.<br />
2. Murlocs are actually the in game item for attending blizzcon this year ( and have also been many years before that )...so if you wanna call us murlocs thats fine...were just that epic now.<br />
3. Murlocs are Murlocs!.. Epic enough.<br />
<br />
So overall I am happy with hunter set. Oh and also if you have seen the season 9 pvp gear for a hunter..we look like a samurai warrior..Blizzard imo has given hunters some damn nice looking sets.</div></div><hr />

Hunter season 9 set is my fav PvP set so far (don't even bring TBC PvP sets. They were just recolor of tier sets).<br />

As for the hunter set. I can't help but think this is the joke one of the lot. Sure, people like murlocs and so im pretty sure they'll like this and as so, blizz probably will get away with it.

But i'm not letting down my main! <br />
As for buffs / nerfs news...<br />
Again no hunter love dps wise..<br />
Multishot is a joke and the casting time on our aimed shot is just pathetic..<br />
I can only use it when procs..<br />
Hmm I wonder how many people complained or do need to complain before blizzard actually listens.<br />
Even with the changes done to mages / warlocks their still ridiculously OP.<br />
Seen a warrior do 10k in a heroic today, so QQ works...<br />
<br />
Seriously? Why do you or anyone else give a damn about balance at level 80. I just know my class(Mage) which is fine at 85 is going to be turned to garbage by Blizzard listening to QQers who cry and think level 80 pve/pvp needs to be perfectly balanced for the whole last month and a half we have before Cataclysm. And no don't take my post to mean I think Mages and other classes are balanced well at level 80 because I know how ridiculously overpowered they were especially before the hotfixes. I just think Blizzard should balance for 85 because it's not worth breaking classes at 85 just so players can be more balanced for a month.<br />
<br />
On a side note, I think you guys are crazy saying the Hunter tier 11 set is ugly. It looks very unique to me which is more than we can say for the Pally tier 11 set which looks like a toned down version of the warrior tier 11 set.</div></div><hr />

People hardly ever complain about the colors if it's a good model. What they complain about is how half the tiers make us look like this:<br />

Indeed, but imo Paladin's need to look like bright, shining and beautiful (and for beautiful we mean not-so-virile, sometimes) warriors, making them get some Power Rangers gear at the end :) I don't even play with a Death Knight, i was just making a connection with the &quot;dark side&quot;.</div></div><hr />

3) We think Shadow priest dps is too high, but that's largely a result of Shadow Word: Death spam, which is tough on healers. We'll be fixing that.<br />

Why there are always people complaining about Paladin's tiers colors and &quot;gayness&quot;? xD Paladins are Holy Knights, Light Knights (aka the good ones) or whatever you want to call them. If you want some dark stuff, some virile colors and not-so-bright manful spells you should stop whining and try a Death Knight. Yes, -»DEATH«- Knight.<br />

In all honesty there's a striking difference between looking like a holy warrior, and looking like the village idiot.</div></div><hr />

Yeah! Clunky, burning skull-face helms, fish scales, rope-bound rocks &amp; stone weights slathered in fish scales &amp; gaudy colors. I'm not sure that defines anything other than garbage. He's wearing SEA GARBAGE. And it looks it.</div></div><hr />

Now you're just looking for trouble.<br />

OT, both sets look good imo, and nice to see the buffs on the melee classes. <br />
I think Boub or the blues forgot to post the buff on Mortal Strike, it def hits harder now post-hotfix.</div></div><hr />

Yeah the helm is horrible. It looks like a giant Murloc skull and I HATE murlocs. I'll definitely be hiding that. In fact, I think all the sets are ugly to tell the truth. We need an option like in LOTRO where you can keep the look of a piece of gear while actually having a different one equipped. I'd be wearing the Onyxia helm forever if I could.<br />

Boub insists on putting said models on stuff most of the time. For what reason, I don't know.

<br />
I like the paladin one, cept the helm(looks like Frylock from ATHF, lol). Maybe the effect puts some kind of light coming out of the top (TORCH MAAAAAN!) or emenating around the sides. If it's good enough, and offsets the helmets look, I'm all in. I especially like the gloves on it as well, looks like they'd be truly statuesque, like their fingers aren't meant to move, as if they were cut from the hardest of stone.</div></div><hr />

Because if they admitted even 1/4 of this it would make people realize they are paying to test a game, check out the bonuses they are gonna give executives in Actiblizzard at the end of this quarter and then realize that the paying population of WoW gave that to them in these two months when they should have made it F2P or discounted in terms of payment given the fact that they were destroying previously established content and replacing it with unbalanced content, so that everyone who legitimately bought their WotLK could no longer enjoy their game that they purchased.<br />
