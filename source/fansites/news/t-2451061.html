<br />
<br />
The Spirit of Sharing<br />
The main area where the festivities take place is right outside the capital cities for the Horde and Alliance and in a couple of smaller towns.<br />
<br />
<br />
Players can interact with the many foods options set on these tables and will gain a buff by eating or passing each of the servings. <br />
There are 5 buffs in total that you can gain that when combined together will reward the The Spirit of Sharing (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/61849-the-spirit-of-sharing) buff that grants 10% increase in reputation gains for one hour. This is great if you are working on Legion reputations and completing World Quests or working on other reputations for a little boost. <br />

<br />
Cooking<br />
Pilgrim’s Bounty is centered around cooking and there are 5 recipes to add to your cooking collection. All you need to do is buy the Bountiful Cookbook (http://www.wowdb.com/items/46809-bountiful-cookbook) from Bountiful Barrel (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/35337-bountiful-barrel) located at each capital city table to learn them. The recipes are used for several quests, dailies, and the Now We’re Cookin’ (http://www.wowdb.com/achievements/3577-now-were-cookin) achievement related to the holiday.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
Cosmetic Items<br />
5 daily quests can be found around the bountiful tables at capital cities that award a piece of a non-transmoggable Pilgrim’s set or a Pilgrim's Bounty (http://www.wowdb.com/items/116404-pilgrims-bounty) cache. <br />
<br />
<br />
The cache can contain the Fine Pilgrim's Hat (http://www.wowdb.com/items/116401-fine-pilgrims-hat), the Frightened Bush Chicken (http://www.wowdb.com/items/116403-frightened-bush-chicken) battle pet and the Silver-Plated Turkey Shooter (http://www.wowdb.com/items/116400-silver-plated-turkey-shooter) toy, along with several consumable foods and turkey shooters. <br />
The quests are centered around cooking so having at least a 280 skill level will help but if you do not have the skill level, you can buy the items needed from Bountiful Barrel (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/35337-bountiful-barrel) at each capital city table.<br />

Join the Feast During Pilgrim’s Bounty November 19–26!<br />
Even as war rages between the Horde and the Alliance, there’s still an abundance of good fortune to celebrate during Pilgrim’s Bounty.<br />
<br />
Pilgrim’s Bounty is a time to reflect upon one’s good fortune and share with all around you.<br />
<br />
When: November 19–26<br />
Where: All capital cities and most Horde and Alliance towns<br />
<br />
You can brush up on your cooking skills and indulge in the delectable delicacies found on the on the communal dining tables located outside capital cities. Sharing is Caring (https://www.wowdb.com/achievements/3558-sharing-is-caring), so make sure to pass food to those who have joined the feast at your table. Just be ready in case a “&quot;FOOD FIGHT!&quot; (https://www.wowdb.com/achievements/3579-food-fight)” breaks out.<br />
<br />
If you prefer a little wild game, then set out on a hunt for wild turkey to earn The Turkinator (https://www.wowdb.com/achievements/3578-the-turkinator) achievement—or transform your friends into tantalizing turkey targets if the fury of wild turkeys proves too daunting to face.<br />

Isn't Classic going to be running on the current engine? I thought I read it would even be using the new models.</div></div><hr />

With the inevitable decline of WoW, MMO-C is having to branch out to remain relevant :P (JK, but it is cool to see XIV acknowledged on the front page)</div></div><hr />

It is on the current engine, but not using the new models. It's using the old Vanilla art data.</div></div><hr />

It's just the character and gear models that look terrible if you zoom in a bit - even maxed out and at 200% resolution.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, they are MMO champion, not Blizzard champion. :P Still, a pleasant surprised. I was ready to laugh at them not mentioning Shadowbringer at all and instead focusing on throwback tuesday to pretend there is anything to talk about for wow.</div></div><hr />

Best MMO IMO. Good that MMO-C are covering news about that game here too. Would love to see more.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Absolutely, So glad to see FFXIV getting more coverage as FFXIV is WAAAAY more MMO than WoW is these day's.<br />
<br />
If MMO-C would have kept on about WoW only they mayaswell have given the domain name to someone who would use it for multiple MMO's not just one shitty one.</div></div><hr />

Yep. It's one of the hottest games out right now. I watched a stream of it, they did a HELL of a job on it, too. Looks fantastic. Pure nostalgia, with a modern look.</div></div><hr />
